Yet the tender meditative opening scenes of Reign Over Me neatly dispel any mental imagery that may have formed involving a gurning Sandler spraying silly string at a group of irate Muslims. As Paul Thomas Anderson did with Punch-Drunk Love director Mike Binder has twigged on to the fact that if you root Sandlers genially churlish moron act into a more sober foundation a vulnerable believable and even lovable character can begin to emerge.Here he plays Charlie Fineman a one-time dentist and dead ringer for 60s-era Dylan (Todd Haynes will be kicking himself) who having lost his wife and daughters during the 2001 attacks now lives alone with the support of government compensation and has taken to meandering the streets on a motorised scooter cocooned in a bleating soundtrack of 70s radio rock (Springsteen The Who The Pretenders). Its only when Charlie bumps into ex-college roommate Alan (Don Cheadle) that he spies a potential playmate who wont force him to face up to his past. With its impressive central performance this is undoubtedly Sandlers film yet by the final act you begin to wish that his electric presence was served with something a little more offbeat than the obligatory is he insane? courtroom showdown appended by a series of textbook cathartic monologues. Still even though Reign Over Me acknowledges the legacy of 9/11 it thankfully never gets bogged down in emotive eulogising or political finger-pointing focusing tightly on Charlies tragicomic emotional evolution.

Saying too because it can be painful switching from grief to merriment like real life. This is an unexpected little movie in that I didnt believe I would be as fixated and fascinated but merely attempting to witness something I couldnt relate to. That is after all escapism. Right ? But I care about these people especially the dentist who has such a good heart and selfless compulsion to put someone other than himself first. I guess I dont like Charlie very much at all in fact and I dont think were supposed to it even relate to him. But hes a character that we can recognize and with whom we can experience all-consuming pain. But the dentist friend Dr Johnson now hes a stunning man--wonderful acting all around.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review A Terrible Thing to Waste The Lookout is a nifty neurological thriller that only goes brain-dead at the end. Plus Adam Sandlers 9/11 movie. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Paul Willoughby  (Photo Allen Fraser/Courtesy of Miramax Films) Chris Pratt played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the perfect patsy-hero for the crafty little minor-key thriller The Lookout a young man who has sinned in his own eyes and is also brain-damagedcompromised both morally and neurologically. When we first see him hes Slapshot Pratt a high-school rich-kid hockey star whos so certain of his indestructibility that he sails along a Midwest country road sans headlights the better to show off all the fireflies (theyre mating) to his girlfriend his buddy and his buddys girlfriendtwo of whom dont survive the subsequent collision. Now he spends his days at an independent life skills center and his nights as a janitor at a small bank where hell never have the cognitive function to rise to the level of teller. Sometimes I cry for no reason he writes in the journal he keeps in the battle to make sense of his life. The Lookout is the directing debut of the screenwriter Scott Frank (Out of Sight Minority Report) who reportedly wrote the script years agowell before Memento in which a brain injury plays havoc with both the protagonists short-term memory and the movies syntax. For those with a taste for neo-noir it might be disappointing that Chriss handicap doesnt generate seismic spatial-temporal dislocations. Franks ambitions are comparatively modest to deliver a nice tight genre piece with people you like watching so much that you barely feel the directors squeeeeze until you suddenly cant breathe. The forlorn Chris finds himself befriended at a bar by Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode) and a babe who calls herself Luvlee (the luscious Isla Fisher). Gary was a big fan of his high-school hockey playing Luvlee was such a big fan she cant believe shes kissing Slapshot Pratt The poor pratI mean Prattis the easiest bank-employee mark imaginable. Gordon-Levitt is a major tabula rasa actor. Its simpler to say what he doesnt do wronganythingthan what he does right. As in Mysterious Skin and Brick hes a minimalist no fuss no placards no Method sense-memory exercises. You dont catch him playing brain-damaged. You know his Chris is in chaos by the way he doesnt seize the space by what he takes away from the character. His feelings run deepest when that rubber face goes slack. Gordon-Levitt is a great re-actor and he bounces off some barnstormers here. As his intemperate blind roommate Lewis nice-guy-actor Jeff Daniels gets to wallow in the head of another self-righteous jerk (the last one was in The Squid and the Whale) and Danielss relish for playing a man with a chip on his shoulder the size of a tractor and nothing left to lose makes you love the character beyond reason. In Match Point Matthew Goode played Jonathan Rhys Meyerss mysteriously welcoming upper-class tennis partnermysteriously because Goode couldnt help but give the character an impish subtext as if some skeezy punch line were coming (except that Woody Allen forgot to write it). In The Lookout hes playing an American but the wiles are entertainingly English Its that mocking sinceritythat ironic fatuous niceness. Goodes Gary is just the friendliest guy Hes seductive even when you know where the movie is headingand when the editor Jill Savitt steals a beat from his close-ups to give you subliminal willies. Its almost a relief when the double entendres stop and Gary shows his true feral colors. Franks writing is razor-sharp his filmmaking whistle-clean. As a fan of sharp razors and clean whistles I enjoyed The Lookoutyet I did feel let down by the climax which ought to have been blunter and messier and crazier and more cathartic. It sounds churlish I know but a thriller with a hero like Gordon-Levitts Chris should be more of an act of sympathetic imagination. The payoff needed to be more brain-damaged. Reign Over Me is the rare studio film with the fullness of a novela novel that reels and overreaches and never finds its footing. The writer and director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger) brings his screwball-sitcom temperament to a fictional premise that would stagger our most ruminative tragedian. Five years after the death of his wife and three daughters in one of the planes that crashed into the World Trade Center Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) remains in a state of extreme denialhe seems more brain-damaged than the hero of The Lookout. Whizzing around Manhattan on a scooter hes hailed by Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) his college roommate and dental-school chum. While Alan recalls their relationship Charlie nods politely (Cool cool) and then prepares to go on his way. He doesnt want to remember anything. In some ways Charlie isnt a stretch for Sandler. His comic shtick has always depended on him living in his own head and being self-servingly slow-witted. The persona is a hostile onepassive-aggressive with the odd ferocious ejaculation. But Sandler was surprisingly soulful as an overgrown adolescent lashing out at the world for its unreliability in Paul Thomas Andersons tipsy romantic fantasia Punch-Drunk Love. And as Charlie Fineman hes like a dammed-up Bob Dylanhe even sports a shaggy Dylan-circa-1969 hair mop and a mumble that seems to issue straight from his sinuses. Hes always ready to boogieespecially when someone wants him to acknowledge the death of his family. The worst are his wifes parents (Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon) whove clung to the tragedy and rather selfishly feel they need his presence to help them cope. Cheadles Alan isnt that extreme but he does enlist the aid of a psychiatrist played by an oddly castbut not badLiv Tyler. 1 2 Next Share this story...

By Claudia Puig USA TODAY In Reign Over Me a scruffy Adam Sandler bears a strong resemblance to the midcareer Bob Dylan. His performance as a sad and lost man is occasionally as poignant as one of the heart-wrenching songs on Dylans seminal 1975 album Blood on the Tracks. Indeed music from that era plays a big part in the film. The songs chosen for the score -- rock ballads by Bruce Springsteen Graham Nash Jackson Browne The Pretenders The Who and Pearl Jam -- illuminate and amplify the darkly emotional mood. SEE A CLIP Take a peek at Reign Over Me The film meanders a bit and seems to lose some steam about halfway through. But the chemistry between Sandler and Don Cheadle keeps us engaged. Writer/director Mike Binder has fashioned a film that sensitively explores male friendship and the lingering effects of grief and trauma. Sandler plays Charlie Fineman a former dentist who lost his wife and three daughters on Sept. 11. Five years later Charlie has not recovered coping by trying to block out memories of his family by regressing to a near-adolescent state. Binder wisely cast Sandler for the part of this man-child who putters around the city on a motorized scooter is addicted to video games and listens obsessively to his iPod. A chance encounter with his college roommate Alan Johnson (Cheadle) prompts Charlie to begin to emerge from his isolated state. And Alan rediscovers a sense of his own identity which he had surrendered by focusing on his dental practice and marriage to the needy Janeane (Jada Pinkett Smith). This is not a simple uplifting tale. Its never clear whether Charlie will fully recover and that sense of realism is the films strength. Amid the somber themes are winning moments of humor and hope. One comic highlight is provided by Alans receptionist played by Paula Newsome last seen as the surly bereavement counselor in Little Miss Sunshine. A subplot involving a dental stalker (Saffron Burrows) feels formulaic as do scenes between Charlie and his shrink (Liv Tyler). The story is at its best when it focuses on the reinvigorating effect of friendship between two middle-aged men. Reign Over Me is a much better choice for Sandler than last years cliched Click and a wise departure from his sophomoric comedies. Cheadle demonstrates his range with this subtly winning performance. Binder showed promise as a storyteller with his last film The Upside of Anger. But he comes closer to realizing his potential with Reign Over Me.

March 23 2007  (out of 4)Starring Adam Sandler Don Cheadle Jada Pinkett Smith Liv Tyler Saffron Burrows. Written and directed by Mike Binder. 124 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowDespite the considerable obstacles stacked against it - Adam Sandler a 9/11 theme and a trailer so heavy-handed that makes it look like it should be titled Reign Man - Mike Binders Reign Over Me turns out to be that genuinely rare Hollywood release a movie that is at once emotionally moving sharply observed and only modestly hopeful.Even more commendable it even manages to make 9/11 connection - already it must be sadly admitted something of a concrete-reinforced cultural cliche - work. As an aunt of mine was prone to ask ""whod have thunk?""The setting is contemporary Manhattan. One evening right after he has seized upon another excuse to escape his lavish uptown apartment and gorgeous uptown wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and kids Dr. Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) is confronted by a ghost from his past - on a Go-Ped.Its Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) Johnsons old college roommate in dental school and someone Alan hasnt seen since he heard the news that Charlies wife and three daughters were killed on the flight from Boston that struck the World Trade Center in 2001. When Johnson catches up to Charlie the mans an evident wreck. Looking eerily like Bob Dylan in his Street Legal period Fineman initially seems to have no clue who Johnson is - despite the fact the dentist recalls Charlies habit of sleepwalking in the nude.This seems to pry the lid open and soon the two men are seen zipping albeit while standing on the back of Charlies scooter through the strangely deserted streets to the jangly strains of the Pretenders ""Stop Your Sobbin.""Its a slyer musical cue than you might think but then again so is the moment while it looks as though youre in for a smooth ride to industrial-strength male-bonded reconciliation heaven Reign Over Me turns out to be one bumpy ride indeed.For one thing Charlies need to deny any link with his past has driven the man both into permanent undergrad slovenliness (his apartment has 5000 records a drum kit and a massive TV for playing video games) and dangerous fitfully-vented rage.Just when Alan - whos got his own denial issues - thinks hes found a way of hoisting Charlie back aboard the reality train his old friend throws a root beer in his face and starts screaming obscenities in public. Later he comes to Alans office and when gripped by another paranoid seizure starts ripping it apart.While these moments make you realize that Upside of Anger writer-director Binder is the first filmmaker since Punch-Drunk Loves P.T. Anderson to not only understand the latent pathology of the Adam Sandler big-baby persona but to see it as a form of regressive male desperation theyre really only onto what half the movie is about.The other half is about Alan his own terror of his familial responsibilities and dwindling options his bottled frustration with his job and his real motivation for being so willing to suddenly drop everything and become Charlies unsolicited saviour. As his wife Janeane so astutely observes theres something in Charlies life that Alan wishes he had - freedom from responsibility. He may be crazy tortured and lonely but he can do what he wants. As Alan Cheadle has a less obviously showstopping role than Sandlers Charlie but in many ways its more interesting.As a man accustomed to putting up a breezily confident front while constantly on the run from doubt Cheadle always seems stuck somewhere in the vast gap between what hes saying and what hes feeling. Sputtering is his natural state.When a patient (Saffron Burrows) - a wounded divorcee who develops an unhealthy obsession with the dentist - offers to perform oral sex on him right there in the office Cheadle goes to the door and pauses before responding. In that pause you know hes struggled with every option before arriving at the most morally responsible one. In his own way Charlies self-appointed rescuer is as precariously verging on total breakdown as Charlie himself.Thats one of the more fruitful dramatic suggestions made by Reign Over Me that Charlie is merely a more extreme expression of an affliction that just about everybody in the film suffers - a terror of looking reality straight in the eye and the need to build psychic firewalls to keep the pain from seeping in. The remarkable thing is as angst-ridden and heavy as it may sound Reign Over Me is remarkably satisfying entertainment. Charlie and Alans relationship is just as dubiously playful (when not root beer-soaked) as it should be. Screenwriter-director Binder has a James L. Brooks-ish knack for engineering scenes with richly realized incidental characters and moments of awkward revelation. Youre constantly aware of the distance between intent and execution in these peoples lives and its really that grey zone - and not the 9/11 shadow - that is the movies true stomping ground. If 9/11 is Charlies excuse whats everybody elses?While ultimately uneven and hampered by both a poor grasp of its female characters and an ending that ironically cops in the direction of adolescent fantasy (for Charlie anyway) Reign Over Me still qualifies as one of the more arresting studio-made surprises of the year so far.At the very least it puts a whole new spin on Billy Madison.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures/Tracy Bennett) NO SALES. NO MAGS. Photo Tracy Bennett I need you pal. Likewise buddy. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Reign Over Me Drama. Starring Don Cheadle Adam Sandler Jada Pinkett Smith Liv Tyler and Saffron Burrows. Directed by Mike Binder. (R. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Nobody in ""Reign Over Me"" ends up buried beneath rubble at the World Trade Center or making a plaintive final phone call to a loved one from a plane commandeered by terrorists. Instead Hollywoods latest dramatization of the Sept. 11 attacks focuses on its aftermath through the sad plight of a New York dentist who retreats from reality when his wife and three daughters are wiped out on that ominous day. The idea is commendable a much-needed reminder that there remain walking wounded like the fictional Dr. Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) still struggling with incomprehensible loss. And there is much to admire onscreen. Don Cheadle gives an elegant understated performance as Charlies long-lost college roommate Alan who reaches out to him after all the professional support organizations have vanished. Writer-director Mike Binder proved himself an expert on male bonding in his HBO series ""The Mind of the Married Man"" and the strongest scenes in ""Reign Over Me"" are of the old pals rekindling their friendship. They alternate on the guitar and drums and hang out in a Manhattan that appears to have been shot through a special lens. The city takes on a golden patina looking so warm and inviting that it seems nothing bad could ever happen there. But as much as one is predisposed to want to like ""Reign Over Me"" and as moving as some parts are its muddled by a script that tries to pack in too much. Theres sufficient material for a couple of films and a sitcom. It isnt enough that poor Charlie suffers from post-traumatic stress resulting in his blocking out the present by listening to 80s rock music and obsessively playing the video game ""Shadow of the Colossus."" Binder has to add another character Donna (Saffron Burrows) whos also traumatized by the discovery that her husband has led a double life with another woman for five years. Piling on the coincidences Charlie and Donna wind up seeing the same shrink (Liv Tyler lacking the gravitas to be dispensing psychiatric wisdom) whose office is in the building where Alan puts veneers on rich peoples teeth. Obsessed with him after a couple of encounters in the elevator Donna shows up for a dental appointment and offers to perform fellatio on a stunned Alan. Binder who made the far more subtle ""The Upside of Anger"" seems to intend Donnas proposition to be both darkly humorous and an indication of her disturbed state. But it feels extraneous as does Alans increasing estrangement from his wife (Jada Pinkett Smith wasted in a role that mostly calls for her to fold napkins and ladle out food). The problem with these subplots is that they distract from the grieving widower. Sandlers bumbling portrayal does nothing to make him compelling either. You can intuit the reasoning that went into this casting choice. Charlie has regressed to an adolescent state and Sandler specializes in playing overgrown adolescents. But he lacks the depth as an actor to make you feel Charlies suffering. Sandler delivers potentially poignant lines in a monotone that becomes well monotonous. To say that he is no match for his co-star is an understatement. Cheadle who just keeps getting better with every movie brings a quiet dignity to Alan. His posture and whole way of being project someone who will always do the right thing. With Charlie however Alan isnt always sure what that is. Theres a defining moment where Charlie invites his buddy to hop aboard a motorized skateboard on which he shuttles around town. Alan hesitates. (Who wouldnt?) On Cheadles expressive face you can see him weighing the danger of being a passenger against the potential damage to their friendship if he refuses. Alan almost envies his pals freedom and Binder doesnt shy away from exploring that with all its implications. Hes an original voice in an industry not known for originality. But ""Reign Over Me"" isnt nearly as arresting as it should be given its powerful subject matter. -- Advisory Minor sexual references and language.

BY Jack Mathewsdaily News Movie Critic Friday March 23 2007 400 AM Photo Gallery ""Reign Over Me"" stills Photo Gallery Movie Premiere ""Reign Over Me"" Drama about a 9/11 widower and his nurturing reunion with his old college roommate. With Adam Sandler Don Cheadle. Director Mike Binder (204). R Language sexual references. At area theaters. The incredibly moving post-9/11 drama ""Reign Over Me"" proves that behind the funny guy facades of former standup comedians Mike Binder and Adam Sandler are a pair of very serious talents. Binder who wrote directed and plays a small role in ""Reign"" showed his serious filmmaking side in 2005 with ""The Upside of Anger"" and Sandler gave a heralded performance as an offbeat businessman in 2002s ""Punch-Drunk Love."" But the complex ""Reign Over Me"" is a dramatic quantum leap over those films. ""Reign"" is the story of two former dental school roommates who are reunited on the streets of Manhattan after one has been devastated by the loss of his wife and three daughters to the horror of 9/11. The other is unhappily prosperous with a beautiful wife two daughters and a sense of domestic imprisonment. When they first meet its hard to understand why the affluent Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) is so determined to reconnect with the scruffy shaggy-haired Charlie Fineman (Sandler) who at first claims not even to remember him. Charlie looks like a homeless person but he actually has unwanted wealth from the family tragedy the memory of which he blocks out by keeping himself busy remodeling his kitchen playing video games and listening to an iPod loaded with 70s and 80s rock music. But if Charlie is in denial so is Alan who is incapable of acknowledging his unhappiness with his loss of freedom in a suffocating marriage. The reunion with Charlie is an opportunity to break out hang out and reclaim a bit of his independence. Cheadle is good as always but Sandlers portrayal of a guy on the perennial brink of a psychotic breakdown is amazing. The scene where he finally attempts to reveal the events of 9/11 is as fine a piece of naked emotional acting as youre likely to see this year. The ""Waterboy"" has made the varsity. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

That happens sometimes at the movies from Harry Careys suicide-by-Comanche in The Searchers to Gary Oldmans vampiric meltdown in Dracula. In Reign Over Me Adam Sandler is a 9/11 widower who lost everything -- wife three daughters and a dog -- on a flight out of Boston. As the shambling suffering Charlie Fineman Sandler sinks his teeth into nothing but the part With his defeated posture and mess of curls he folds into himself becoming both less and more than the agreeably whiny blockhead whose movies have spoken to our inner Cheeto. Theres not much comedy in Reign Over Me. Theres not much occasion for it though the whole film exhibits -- mercifully -- an ameliorating day-to-day bemusement that finds comfort in small things. In the long shadow of Sept. 11 Charlie lives for his vinyl collection his endless kitchen renovation and his video-game assaults on Shadow of the Colossus. In between he buzzes around the city on a go-ped a solitary figure in headphones carving gentle serpentine paths through the canyons of New York. Into this confined existence drops an old friend from college Alan Johnson a thriving cosmetic dentist with a wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and two daughters of his own. Filling the role with his signature dignity is Don Cheadle who radiates decency the way Sandler radiates sloth. As a man who only wants to help Cheadle is entirely credible. As a whipped urban homebody itching for freedom hes less so though his elongated marital fidgets dont chafe as badly as Chris Rocks in I Think I Love My Wife. Reign Over Me introduces a seductress (Saffron Burrows) but promptly rebukes and defangs her shifting attention to the films core relationship. The friendship that evolves between Charlie and Alan is lopsided and chancy the awkward union of a sane man trying to get a fix on a crazy one. But as the film shuffles along writer-director Mike Binder (The Upside of Anger) turns Charlies plight and Alans outreach into an unexpected refutation of all that we think we know about grief. The loss of his family so wounded Charlie that he wont admit he ever had one -- ""I have these things that I dont like to think about"" he says but its less an intimate breakthrough than a dispatch from the lonely outpost of his pain. Charlie gets his breakthrough -- sort of. He also gets his breakdown a climax of imploding anger that shunts him into psychiatric care. Where the movie goes from there isnt obvious until the minute before it happens and when it does its radical subtext is wrapped in some pretty cozy Gemutlichkeit. Heres the message There are limits to the mental-health system. There are depths to illness and aspects of loss that remain unfathomable to the outside world and are best treated with a giant spoonful of acceptance compassion and community. As sweet as that sounds Binders keenly considered character study isnt for anyone in a funk or a rush. Its a sad slow movie. But like Stephen Frears upbeat High Fidelity it finds hope in the snarl of classic rock -- especially the Who (Love ReignOer Me with its themes of death and cleansing) and The River Bruce Springsteens proletarian song cycle of driving and despair. They provide the soundtrack to Charlies lonesome trek the travels of a wounded man who can only heal himself. Its a tough ride but worth it. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Apple Smartwatches at Best Buy 50 off from 249 + free...

They can be the first friends in a life of fresh independence. Chances are you drift apart. Yet the time you met was so ripe with possibility that years even decades later those relationships still hold sway. In ""Reign Over Me"" Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle are Charlie Fineman and Alan Johnson one-time roomies. Married Alan lives more than comfortably with Jeanene (Jada Pinkett Smith) and their daughters in a spacious apartment on Manhattans Upper West Side. Though his partners appear to be in denial hes the glue to their successful dental practice. One afternoon Alan sees Charlie on the streets of the city where they have both settled. When he sees him next their reunion doesnt bode well. Charlies memory is stuck on mute. The headphones he constantly wears over unruly hair blot out the world with Bruce Springsteen or Who tunes like the rock-opera power ballad that inspired the movies title. Writer-director Mike Binder made the wildly sardonic comedy ""The Upside of Anger"" which he penned with Joan Allen in mind. That film about a woman scorned and her four daughters was in part the filmmakers response to 9/11. Anger trumps grief to the embittered end when a startling twist provides a tart unexpected moral. As a central theme grief is still elusive in ""Reign Over Me"" a sentimental journey of solitude and friendship. Sandler does a fine and smirkless job of handling the emotional baggage of Charlie who lost his wife and three daughters in a plane crash - and not just any aviation disaster. Charlie lives in the betwixt- and-between space before his familys devastation. He listens to the music he did in college. His drum kit and guitars have a room of their own. At night he rides a scooter through the streets of Manhattan plays video games in the apartment he shared with his family or remodels then demolishes his kitchen over and over. A video-game reviewer wrote of ""Shadow of the Colossus"" - the game Charlie plays - that one of its best features is ""its sense of solitude one that overwhelms you with simultaneous feelings of calmness and despair."" Is it a wonder Charlies addicted? Binder is an observant filmmaker with a deft feel for the exchanges that take place around the family table. Over dinner Alan says ""I saw Charlie Fineman today."" Everyone goes somber. Its one of the movies most subtle and believably intimate moments. ""Reign Over Me"" gets its ethical footing from Cheadles performance. In turn he gets a steady assist from Pinkett Smith. She exhibits love and clarity with lines like this one delivered when Alan uses their daughter to escape a night of jigsaw puzzling ""You would have thought she got you out of traffic school"" she says wryly. Alan knows he loves his wife. And hes aware enough to realize whatever is ailing him wont be resolved by infidelity. Even when an alluring if unhinged woman (Saffron Burrows) comes to his office to have a veneer fixed he isnt tempted. Good thing because not being interested still lands him in a lawsuit. And Alans self-knowledge doesnt stop him from pestering psychiatrist Angela Oak- hurst (Liv Tyler) outside her office with questions that begin weakly ""I have this friend. ..."" The film forces some of its connections (the seductive woman sticks around the movie) but ""Reign Over Me"" pulls off a sweet parity between its main characters. Charlie frees the buttoned-down Alan with his unfettered penchant for spontaneity. He reintroduces Alan to boyish ""fun."" Their fun is fragile. A visit to Alans office reminds Alan and us that Charlie suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Alan begins forcing Charlie back into the world of the living the talking the grieving. Charlies in-laws the Templemans (Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon) hunger for a contact that will keep their memories alive. Charlies refusal puts them on a collision course. Donald Sutherland makes a searingly humane appearance as the judge who must decide if Charlie will be institutionalized. The Templemans need reminds us how differently waves of sudden grief strike. Sandler and Cheadles fine chemistry reminds us that friendship can be a balm can bring joy can - sometimes must - be an intervention.

Disheveled and intense the scooterist resembles a younger Bob Dylan. His name is Charlie Fineman he is played by Adam Sandler and hes anything but simple. Like many of Mr. Sandlers characters Charlie boils with inchoate rage beneath a simpletons placid exterior. The difference here is the source of his distress -- his wife and children were on one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 and losing them has turned Charlie once a successful dentist into a sort of Rain Man shut off from the world. This is not a simple picture. Its serious disarmingly funny at times and certainly ambitious yet diminished by some of the traits that have made the standard Sandler characters so popular. ENLARGE The film which takes its title from the song by The Who was written and directed by Mike Binder the man responsible for ""The Upside of Anger"" the fine 2005 comedy about female rage. His new one a raunchy hymn to the power of friendship co-stars Don Cheadle as Alan Johnson a prosperous cosmetic dentist who roomed with Charlie in college. (Refreshingly race doesnt enter into the picture; the script is color-blind.) Fourteen years after dental school and half a decade after 9/11 Alan chances to see Charlie scooting by catches up with him and discovers why his old friend dropped out of sight. Moved by his plight Alan becomes the instrument of Charlies renewal -- his possible renewal since Alan is only an amateur therapist treating a patient who could pass for a paranoid schizophrenic. In a New York story thats Hollywood-heavy with healers and healing (Liv Tyler plays an earnest shrink) one hand must therapize the other so Charlie also serves as the instrument of his friends liberation -- from Alans own emotional opacity and from the tedium of what he calls ""putting phony teeth on phony people."" As the movie wears on though Charlies behavior grows not only repetitive -- mood swings between violent and sweetly passive rageful and contrite -- but increasingly reminiscent of the Sandler archetype a sly Peter Pan who persists in being lovable. Indeed Charlie goes beyond childhood into a cloying infantilism thats only partly explained by regression in the face of unmanageable tragedy; you wonder how he ever worked with a probe and drill. Don Cheadle is as always a quietly commanding star with an engaging quick-witted presence. Still his character like much of the movie suffers from a case of what seems to be communicable infantilization. Alan is an educated man with a lovely wife -- played attractively by Jada Pinkett Smith -- and bright children. Yet he like others around him cant seem to grasp let alone articulate the gravity of Charlies condition. Thus the drama keeps lapsing into conventional comedy (which sometimes works well) when it isnt converting Charlies grief and Alans frustration into the borderline bathos of buddies who are both wounded birds. Saffron Burrows is eerily amusing as Donna Remar a troubled beauty with nymphomaniacal tendencies but Donna too falls into the prevailing pattern of being healed and more alarming still helping to heal. Only Paula Newsome as Melanie a receptionist in Alans office gets to play -- gleefully well -- a cynic whose delicious cynicism stays unsoftened. Melanies a real person with real teeth and a real bite. Shooter Mark Wahlberg stars as the peerless marksman of ""Shooter"" an updating and downgrading of Stephen Hunters popular 1993 novel ""Point of Impact."" Betrayed by his beloved Marines after a covert mission in the Horn of Africa goes bad Bob Lee Swagger leaves the military for the life of a mountain man until hes seduced into quasi-governmental service. Soon hes betrayed yet again by a shadowy cabal that awakens his dormant patriotism then frames him as a presidential assassin. The result is lots of gunplay and explosions governed by little logic plus some tantalizing factoids about things that a sniper must consider before sniping at a target a mile away. (Including the Coriolis effect which involves the rotation of the earth.) If theres an organizing principle at work in the film which was directed by Antoine Fuqua its that everyone in government is corrupt. The bad guys include a Strangelovian character in a wheelchair so ""Shooter""s covert intent could have been satire. Overtly though its definitely about shooting betrayal and shooting. In that order. Pride ENLARGE Terrence Howard and Bernie Mac in Pride the story of an inner-city swimming team. Terrence Howard is a singular star -- firmly grounded never flashy yet formidably intense and capable of communicating passion with a poignant glance. And ""Pride"" is a tale that needed to be told. Its the story of Jim Ellis an inspirational coach who founded an inner-city swim team in Philadelphia in the early 1970s and who continues to this day bringing young African-Americans to competitive swimming. Despite Mr. Howards best efforts in the role though the film rarely realizes its subjects potential. The first signs of trouble appear in the opening credits -- four writers and preposterously 17 producers. Its impossible to know which of these cooks did what to the scripts thin broth. But the telling of a relatively straightforward story is semicoherent and the hero is written so sketchily that he barely has a life outside the run-down recreation center where he works and which he rehabilitates for the benefit of the neighborhood kids. What a waste -- and not only of a shot at genuine uplift or of Bernie Mac a gifted comic actor who seems baffled by his perfunctory role as the rec centers janitor. ""Pride"" chooses to airbrush the authentic black anger of the period in the course of dramatizing the clash between Jim Elliss team and the bigoted whites they swam against. Yet all isnt lost. Terrence Howards participation confers authority on the production and Elliss young swimmers have their own unquenchable exuberance. ""Keep your focus"" the coach tells them. They do and so does he even though the film cant. Offside By any conventional measure ""Offside"" a film from Iran by Jafar Panahi falls somewhere between small and slight. Yet this charming comedy takes on a big subject with great zest. It concerns the plight of Iranian women -- wait wait this is no earnest feminist tract -- who happen to be soccer fans but who are excluded from the nations stadiums even though they may be equal to Iranian men in their passion for the sport. The heroines are a diverse group of young Tehrani women whove been busted for trying to crash a World Cup qualifying match against Bahrain. Most of the action takes place in a stadium holding pen where boobish boys in military uniforms seek to explain the logic of the policy they enforce. They dont know what theyre talking about of course. But the delicately subversive Mr. Panahi makes his subjects perfectly clear -- the stupidity of authority and the hypocrisy of discrimination. ""Offside"" is surprisingly entertaining and edifying to boot.    DVD TIP Adam Sandlers dark side was put to brilliant use in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" (2002) Paul Thomas Andersons one-of-a-kind comedy of anxiety and explosive delusion. Mr. Sandler is Barry Egan the addled lover of the title and Emily Watson is Lena the woman of Barrys dreams. Jon Brion did the percussive and inimitable soundtrack.

Charlie Fineman has nothing but a dark apartment haunted by a big-screen television and the PlayStation game Shadow of the Colossus.When the immaculately groomed Alan (Don Cheadle) sees former roomie Charlie (Adam Sandler) on the street he is stunned. Can this raggedy man who looks just a ladle away from the soup kitchen really be his onetime pal?Alan knows that Charlie lost his wife and daughters in a plane crash - and is in such denial that he cant say out loud that the crash was on 9/11. As he extends a hand to help Charlie the last thing Alan expects is that this simple act of kindness will be the shock therapy he needs to jump-start his own dead emotional engine.Reign Over Me is about both the impossibility and the necessity of male friendship. Likewise the impossibility and necessity of sorting through the post-9/11 emotional debris that particulate matter that coats the atmosphere and psyches of America. The films point is that all of us not only Alan and Charlie are still in the shadow of the colossus.Written and directed by Mike Binder whose The Upside of Anger was similarly ambitious audacious and messy (by which I mean psychologically keen and narratively implausible) Reign is a triumph for Cheadle and Sandler whose performances strew the seeds of regeneration.Both in his practice and in his person Alan specializes in porcelain veneers. He may look gleaming and together but he has buried his emotions so deep and so well that he doesnt know how to recover them - or even where they are. His life is so full of work and obligation that there is no oxygen to breathe. He wants therapy but cant make an appointment with a professional in his building (the beauteous Liv Tyler). Instead he asks her questions when he sees her in the hall.Cheadle a wiry actor drawn more to the fine grains than the broad strokes of character (Buck in Boogie Nights Paul Rusesagabina in Hotel Rwanda) carries himself like a man so tightly wrapped that hes coming apart. Yet from Alans wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) to his receptionist (Paula Newsome) to his patients (especially Saffron Burrows) the women around him variously handle manhandle and sexually harass him.Alans feeling unmanned when he runs into Charlie whose tousled curls pursed lips and hangmans muffler signify Bob Dylan of the Blonde on Blonde album cover. Charlie who doesnt remember Alan or much else is so unhinged that he makes Alan feel composed.And as Alans wife shrewdly notes the man who has it all is secretly envious of the man who has lost it all because Charlie who scooters through Manhattan like a teenager relieved of his parents lives free of obligation and responsibility.Binder (an actor/writer/director who gives himself a small part in the film as Charlies attorney) gets the best out of his actors in this electrifying character study.A few droplets of Alans attention make the wilted Charlie spring back to something like life. Before long Alan persuades Charlie to take off his headphones (the film takes its title from an anthem by the Who) and tune into the world around him. And he even agrees to get therapy.Reign provides Sandler with the trickiest and most ambitious role of his career. Tricky because in the recent past the fanboys havent flocked to see this jester in a serious role. Ambitious because its degree of difficulty surpasses that of the other projects hes done where a character not necessarily his has mental or neurological issues (Punch-Drunk Love 50 First Dates Spanglish).The undercurrent of rage that flows through Sandlers work threatens to turn tidal here - and that works to Reigns advantage. It keeps Cheadle and the audience on edge. This said Sandler only intermittently drew me into Charlie. Is it because people lacking emotional affect are robotic? Or is it something lacking in Sandlers performance?The therapeutic community will be startled to see a psychiatrist prescribe her nymphomaniac patient for Charlie. (Charlies delusion? Binders fantasy?)Happily this does not sink Binders film. An eleventh-hour boost from Donald Sutherland as a judicious judge helps keep it afloat. As does Russ T. Alsobrooks nocturnal cinematography showing Manhattan as a place where the twinkling lights cant fully penetrate the ominous shadows. Yet it is also a place where a shadow-ridden man can reclaim the past and help his friend see the light.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215 854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.A Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementCruz pledges to unify GOP AmericansMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

"Reign Over Me Letting Sandler be Sandler helps Cheadle stand out - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReign Over Me Letting Sandler be Sandler helps Cheadle stand outBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 03/22/2007 025046 PM PDTUpdated 03/23/2007 031648 PM PDTClick photo to enlargeDon Cheadle left and Adam Sandler play old college chums whose paths have diverged since then in ""Reign Over Me.""<<1>>The Unofficial Adam Sandler Project is an effort by a group of Hollywood writer-directors - with all the ego that little hyphen implies - to exploit Sandlers undeniable screen presence while redirecting his acting energies from autistic to artistic. By placing Sandlers character in counterpoint to the world we know as normal that world is turned upside down. Crazy becomes the new normal. Paul Thomas Anderson was the first to try this in the 2002 romance ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and James L. Brooks found a box tight enough in ""Spanglish"" two years later to make Sandler completely square. Now comes Mike Binders ""Reign Over Me"" in which Sandler is set loose from the box and every other kind of constraint playing a man driven to the verge of madness by his own grief. ""Reign Over Me"" is the first of these serious-minded movies to let Sandler be Sandler As Charlie Fineman he is alternately dazed childlike and goofy. Its a generous performance one that does credit both to Sandler and to the movie. But the first critic to declare it a work of genius should be remanded to the custody of ""Happy Gilmore"" on an endless loop. The real standout piece of acting in ""Reign Over Me"" is by Don Cheadle as Charlies old friend Alan Johnson. It may well be that the best thing about this picture is the casting of a black actor in a leading role that could just as easily have gone to a white actor. Cheadles performance not only stands in marked contrast to Sandlers it reminds you of the easy naturalism that once was the hallmark of leading men such as Gregory Peck and Spencer Tracy.Advertisement ""Reign Over Me"" has some of the purposeful chaos of Robert Altmans movies and while Im not sure Altman would claim it or even like it very much he would almost certainly recognize its transgressive spirit. When Binder isnt stuck on message the picture has a breezy inconsequential charm. But in at least two unforgivably manipulative scenes - one involving a suicide attempt the other a court hearing - the movie asks us for feelings that it has not yet earned. Charlie is Alans long-lost roommate from dental school who had a successful practice until 9/11. Then he became ""the guy from dental school whose family was on the plane"" as Alans daughter puts it with ruthless economy. Now he looks like Bob Dylan and rides around Manhattan on a motorized scooter - neither one exactly a sign of mental stability. Worse when he and Alan have a chance encounter on the street Charlie doesnt remember him. Eventually Alan manages to get through to Charlie that they know each other and he follows his old friend back to his apartment. Charlie just sits down and begins to play a video game as if no one were there. The apparent ease with which Alan gets sucked into what his wife refers to as ""Charlie World"" - riding around on his scooter eating Chinese food at all hours - reveals how little joy hes feeling at home. The odd thing about the movie isnt the mental fog into which the old Charlie Fineman has disappeared. Its how weirdly confrontational everyone else is. As Alan begins to vanish into Charlies cloud you would expect him to begin having problems with his wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and he does. But Alan also has blow-ups with his business partners with the shrink down the hall (Liv Tyler) and most especially with an over-attentive patient (Saffron Burrows) who would like to have more than his dental utensils in her mouth. In fact there isnt a character in the movie whos capable of observing normal behavioral boundaries. Meanwhile the parents of Charlies wife (Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein) badger him for refusing to grieve as they do by constantly looking at pictures of his dead family. Charlie may be the only character in the movie with boundaries its just that his have been turned into a blast wall against remembering. As a writer Binder uses his characters bottled up anger to create conflict and move the plot along. And its not as if the guy who wrote and directed ""The Upside of Anger"" as Binder did would have any reason to conceal his affinity for using arguments as a dramatic device. But human beings do have other means of communicating. Even when theyre angry.

"Reign Over Me A Winning Pair Beats the Odds washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Reign Over Me A Winning Pair Beats the Odds Alan (Don Cheadle) and Charlie (Adam Sandler) help each other confront emotional problems. (By Tracy Bennett -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 23 2007 The trailer for ""Reign Over Me"" is enough to send me running screaming from the theater. A touching comedy-drama starring Adam Sandler as a man who was widowed on Sept. 11 2001 from Michael Binder the writer-director who gave us the most overrated movie of 2005 ""The Upside of Anger""? You couldnt pay me to see it. But -- funny thing -- the company that owns the newspaper youre reading did pay me to see it. And Im here to report that against all odds despite its flaws by the skin of its teeth ""Reign Over Me"" works. This is indeed a touching comedy-drama featuring Sandler at his most unmannered and vulnerable. Whats more Binder has dared to make a movie about grief that resists and even subverts the expected pieties about closure and moving on. Much of the success of ""Reign Over Me"" not surprisingly has to do with the presence of Don Cheadle in the co-leading role which allows him once again to act as the glue in a production that doesnt necessarily give him the showiest material. Here he plays a prosperous Manhattan dentist named Alan Johnson who one night spies his old college roommate Charlie Fineman (Sandler) scootering through a crowded street. They cross paths again and when Alan says hello Charlie doesnt recognize him. Five years after losing his wife and three daughters on 9/11 hes been stuck like a needle on one of his beloved vinyl records in a groove of isolated occasionally unhinged denial. To Alan -- whos stuck in a sort of mid-marriage groove himself -- theres something clearly alarming about Charlies mental state but theres something appealing about it too. As the two men reconnect their friendship becomes as much about Alan indulging his inner 20-year-old as it is about him helping Charlie out of his emotional paralysis. Reduced to its respective parts ""Reign Over Me"" falls prey to some of the same tics and tropes of Binders previous work (he also wrote and directed the HBO series ""The Mind of the Married Man""). Commitment is a drag guys like to bond over Chinese food and video games and every woman is impossibly beautiful not to mention available (Liv Tyler plays a young psychiatrist friend of Alans Jada Pinkett Smith plays his wife and Saffron Burrows plays an amorous patient). Theres a curious interchange played for laughs involving a homosexual slur and way too many music cues from the 1970s and 1980s. Still in every scene theyre in Cheadle and Sandler manage to find the honesty of male friendship amid the rituals and cliches; and even when ""Reign Over Me"" seems like it might succumb to man-crush mawkishness and too-pat plot devices the movie goes somewhere entirely new and gratifying. When Charlie is nearly committed by his in-laws (Robert Klein and Melinda Dillon) his case is decided by a Solomonic judge played by Donald Sutherland who gets to the core of the movies meaning and propels it to a conclusion that is satisfying precisely because it doesnt try to be too satisfying. As for the elephant in the room -- the context of 9/11 itself -- it still feels like something artists need to earn not use as some glib emotional shorthand. Again Binder acquits himself well avoiding hyperbole and gratuitous bathos. Its even possible to see Charlie as symbolizing that part of the collective American psyche that as the satirical newsweekly the Onion put it soon after the attacks longed to care about stupid stuff again. Except they didnt use the word ""stuff."" Like Charlie on his scooter ""Reign Over Me"" swoops and weaves between twin poles of sentimentality and pop nostalgia. But somehow it dodges those dangers and never gives in to cheesy uplift. (Viewers may be reminded of ""Good Will Hunting"" not only by the themes of mental illness and friendship but by the hairs-breadth tonal control.) Binder has set a difficult course -- to use the conventions of generic comedy and melodrama to say something original about the healing power of not necessarily healing -- and he nails it with just inches to spare. Reign Over Me (124 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity and some sexual references.

"Reign over Me | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; reign-over-me ) Reign over Me (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Reign Over Me has the best of intentions but despite its desire to show how the perseverance of a good man can produce profound results it bungles the attempt. This is a shameless and clumsy tearjerker - a film that inadvertently comes across as exploiting the tragedy of 9/11 in the quest for sappy melodrama. Writer/director Mike Bender has overstretched his ability crafting a bogus would-be feel-good tale that takes too long where its going and stops instead of ending. The script is littered with strange contrivances and pointless tangents and the thespian skills of Adam Sandler are unequal to the task of playing a man whose emotional pain has reduced him to a shell-shocked husk. Thus far most movies that have dealt with the events of September 11 2001 have done so intelligently and respectfully recognizing that the date alone carries power for the millions who were emotionally impacted by that day. Reign Over Me however is an example of the kind of thing that can happen when a director sees this as a way to invest his movie with greater gravity. Theres no reason 9/11 has to be built into the movies premise; any tragedy would suffice. However by invoking 9/11 Bender has stacked the deck. The resulting movie argues that despite this shameless move his hand is too weak to play. For Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) September 11 2001 was the end to the comfortable life he built for himself and his family. On that day his wife and three daughters perished when one of the aircraft crashed into the World Trade Center. Since then he has erected an impenetrable emotional wall around himself shutting out memories and all but the most rudimentary impulses of living. He spends his days roving Manhattan on a motorized scooter and his nights holed up in his apartment remodeling his kitchen or playing a video game. Charlies roommate from dental school Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) encounters him on the New York streets one day and is shocked by his former friends condition. Not only doesnt Charlie remember Alan but he seems unable to acknowledge any part of his past. Determined to help Charlie Alan begins the process of forming a bond with the damaged man but its tough going. Probing certain areas can cause Charlie to fly into a rage and he steadfastly refuses to see a therapist. Worse Alans growing obsession with playing the good Samaritan is distancing him from his wife Janeane (Jada Pinkett Smith). Meanwhile things arent going well at work. His fellow dentists are treating him like an employee and a patient (Saffron Burrows) has filed a sexual harassment suit against Alan after he refused her offer of oral sex. The movie tries to chronicle how Alan through his efforts to help Charlie re-discovers his own humanity. By persevering when other men might have given up on his misanthropic friend Alan is rewarded with a greater appreciation of things in life he has taken for granted. Unfortunately Binders overly melodramatic approach to the story robs it of power. There are bizarre tangents - the schizoid patient who ""threatens"" Alan with a blowjob the therapist (Liv Tyler) who tries ineffectively to help Charlie and the parents-in-law who want Charlie to acknowledge them. Reign Over Mes length is also an issue. For about two-thirds of the running time Charlie is the same miserable individual and his relationship with Alan goes through cycles of repetition. This causes the movie to seem monotonous. Once the ""breakthrough"" occurs the pace accelerates and the movie concludes with a rapid and unsatisfying resolution that ties together all the movies storylines. A little thought after the end credits have rolled reveals what a sham the supposedly ""happy"" ending is. With an unkempt appearance that recalls Bob Dylan Adam Sandler is out of his depth. While theres every indication that Sandler possesses the innate ability to become a capable straight actor hes not yet at the point where he can carry off a role like this. His inability to present a credible Charlie transforms the character into a caricature and sends the movie spinning out of control. Binders script isnt the greatest and his direction is not sure-handed but its Sandlers performance that sinks the production. Don Cheadle does what he can to counteract the imbalance but theres a limit to what he can accomplish. Since this is pretty much a two-character piece none of the supporting players can offer much help (as in the case of Jada Pinkett Smith or Liv Tyler) or do appreciable damage (as in the case of Saffron Burrows whose embarrassing character belongs in a different film). Binders previous feature The Upside of Anger offered a dramatically rewarding experience. His intention with Reign Over Me is to try for something deeper but the result is awkward and disappointing. Tears may be shed during the two big ""moments"" but the manipulation during those scenes is so evident that for some viewers it will overshadow the sentiment. Its tough to make a good tearjerker - one need look no further than this misfire to understand why.

Two vividly drawn characters desperately needing to jumpstart their stalled lives fortuitously connect in ""Reign Over Me."" Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle head a strong cast in this affecting drama of friendship and regeneration. Ironically however Sandlers compelling performance in an atypically serious role -- one even more emotionally complex than his troubled character in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" -- may complicate efforts to sell this decidedly unfunny March 23 release. But Sony will need every iota of the thesps star power to help overcome any lingering audience resistance to pics dealing with 9/11 and its aftermath. Written and directed by Mike Binder (""The Upside of Anger"") ""Reign"" pivots on the chance encounter of two former college roommates at precisely the right moment in each mans life. Alan Johnson (Cheadle) a successful Manhattan dentist finds himself overwhelmed by his responsibilities toward his family -- including his beautiful wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) their children and his aging parents -- and his demanding business partners. Feeling increasingly detached and discontented hes almost grateful for the chance to focus on someone in far worse shape Charlie Fineman (Sandler looking like a scruffy 60s-era Bob Dylan) a formerly gregarious fellow who shut down almost completely after his wife and children perished in one of the doomed planes on Sept. 11 2001. When hes not endlessly playing videogames or refurbishing his kitchen Charlie aimlessly traverses the streets of New York on a motor scooter. But even when hes outside he continues to block out the world -- and any unpleasant memories -- by blasting 70s pop and rock through his headphones. Simply by hanging out with his former roomie (and fellow dental school grad) Alan manages to draw Charlie back toward something like normalcy. But even with the help of an insightful therapist (a credible and creditable Liv Tyler) there are limits to how far Alan can coax Charlie along. And that isnt nearly far enough for Charlies in-laws (Robert Klein Melinda Dillon) who resent being denied access to their last link to their lost daughter and grandchildren. Throughout most of ""Reign Over Me"" Binder takes a deliberately paced and casually discursive approach to storytelling allowing his actors all the time and space they need to convey their complexities and reveal telling details of character. Many scenes are infused with an air of spontaneity that is by turns thrilling and portentous so that its often hard to predict whether an encounter or a conversation is building toward a comic-relief punchline or a deadly serious punch-out. There is of course the predictable scene when Charlie finally breaks through and begins to discuss specific details of the day he lost his family. Even here however Binder and his actors manage to surprise Sandler suddenly starts to talk Cheadle and Tyler listen -- attentively as though fearing anything they do might spoil the moment -- and the aud is spellbound. During the 10 minutes or so unfortunately Binder tries too hard too hastily to wrap things up with an all-too-pat resolution. And even though some supporting players make memorable impressions with a minimum of screen time -- most notably Donald Sutherland as a sternly compassionate judge and Paula Newsome as Alans sassy receptionist -- other actors are unable to fully flesh out roles that apparently were diminished in the editing room. Still Sandler (never making a false step while maneuvering though vertiginous mood swings) and Cheadle (deftly commingling instinctive decency with quiet desperation) are individually excellent and bring out the best in each other. And the pic itself transcends its real but relatively minor flaws to score a satisfyingly potent impact. Russ Alsobrooks high-def digital lensing subtly and skillfully sustains the mood of anxiety that percolates below the surface even during humorous moments. The soundtrack includes well-chosen pop and rock hits including two versions -- both the Whos original and a fine cover by Pearl Jam -- of ""Love Reign Oer Me.""

By Anthony Lane Don Cheadle and Adam Sandler in a new movie by Mike Binder.   Credit EDEL RODRIGUEZ Of all the things to make you pause hand on wallet before shelling out for a movie ticket try this a film about the aftermath of 9/11 starring Adam Sandler. What possible cultural need one might ask could be met by such a project? It is thus with a degree of amazement that I find myself nominating ""Reign Over Me"" written and directed by Mike Binder as a movie that might be worth your time. Sandler stars as Charlie Fineman whose existence is a wild rebuke to his name. Charlie is far from fine. He is a human heap whining through New York on a small electric scooter his hearing cut off by a pair of headphones the size of avocados. You might almost think he wanted to be flattened by a truck. He has sheepdog hair graying to the color of old newsprint. For kicks he likes to sit in his apartment and play a video game ""Shadow of the Colossus"" on a huge screen. Over time we discover the colossus in whose shadow Charlie lurks and mumbles to himself. He lost a wife and three daughters on September 11 2001 and then he lost the capacity to admit that he had a wife and three daughters in the first place. Without the will to remember the movie suggests there can be no will to live. That is an unusually gloomy proposition not just for a studio movie but for a society that despite the acts and sites of official commemoration must find good cause to forge ahead from catastrophe. ""Reign Over Me"" closes with at best a cautious hope leaving us more anxious than when we went in and throughout the film there is a stunned and bewildered air hanging over the city like a heavy smog. The action takes place in the present day years after the collapse of the Twin Towers yet when Charlies friend Alan Johnson (Don Cheadle) a dentist runs into Angela Oakhurst (Liv Tyler) a psychiatrist who works in his building and tries to tell her about Charlies family all he can say is that ""they were killed in a plane crash."" How far can denial spread? It isnt only the Charlies of New York in other words who are stuck for words or trapped in immovable feelings. Its the Alans too--a curious fact since Alan is successful and married to the immaculate Janeane (Jada Pinkett Smith) with daughters of his own. Long ago he was Charlies college roommate; now he bumps into him again and makes an effort to resuscitate him. To the movies credit the scheme is hardly a triumph. The moment you think that Charlie is back in the swim he starts to thrash and splutter--laying waste to Alans office or foaming with anger in a coffee shop. Though Alan hooks him up with Angela all that Charlie can do is congratulate the doctor on her breasts and when she starts to ask about bereavement scroll up the volume on his iPod. And yet something does seep through as if to show that fate is not unchangeably malign a channel-flipping Charlie stumbles on ""You Were Never Lovelier"" with Rita Hayworth smiling at Fred Astaire and nearly smiles himself. Better still he persuades Alan to hitch a ride on the back of his scooter which leaves us with the cheery spectacle of two grown men standing bolt upright like shop dummies zipping along to the strains of the Pretenders. ""Stop all your sobbing"" Chrissie Hynde tells us with that imploring crack in her voice but the movie treads haltingly as if to reply Not yet. All the relationships in ""Reign Over Me"" are either busted or badly in need of repair. There is Alans marriage which is seizing up; there is his professional flirtation with Angela (he wants therapy but darent ask for it); and there is the other sort of flirting not so much professional as pornographic which is launched in his direction by Donna Remar (Saffron Burrows) a dental patient of surpassing beauty and unsound mind. I didnt quite believe in her pursuit of Alan and it soon becomes clear that the main weakness of Binders movie is its approach to women which veers between the idolatrous and the petrified. By the end Charlies plight has won the sympathy not just of Angela but of Donna at which point my thoughts drifted into the heretical tragedy is tragedy but if Liv Tyler and Saffron Burrows are tending to your needs might life not be getting a little brighter? These implausibilities may jolt the movie but they dont derail it because they run in line with Binders vision of a fractious off-kilter world. Back in 1990 Binder wrote a fine and underrated film called ""Coupe de Ville"" about three bickering brothers; it was incidentally almost womanless but it proved that he had an ear for the snap and swerve of argument--still well tuned in ""Reign Over Me"" and matched by the eye of Russ Alsobrook his director of photography. Alsobrook works in high-definition digital to rid the city of serenity everything is haste and jumble with pleasure being grabbed and lost on the run and the long nocturnal streets promising more desolation than romance. Even Don Cheadle classy and controlled as he is gets thrown back onto his nerves and his striving to keep himself together though far less anguished than Charlies is somehow the meat of the film. Which leaves us with Adam Sandler. I cannot remember laughing at a single scene of his comedies but here for once his chosen persona--the slurring and disconnected goofball--makes sense although I still think of him as an oddly hollow presence on which to build a movie. His grief is less convincing than his vacancy and one effect of ""Reign Over Me"" is to make you ask Who will improve on Sandler? Who can do for New York in the wake of 9/11 what the young Scorsese De Niro and Keitel did for the city in earlier years and under less threatening skies? The new Sandra Bullock film ""Premonition"" is about a wife and mother who foresees that her husband is about to die. Then he dies. Why is it in movies that people with clairvoyant powers see only the dire and dangerous things that will befall them? If you can predict a death why not the winner of the Belmont Stakes so that you can amble down to the bookies before the beginning of June? No such luck for Bullocks character Linda Hanson who looks fairly stressed even before the premonitions kick in. She is married to Jim (Julian McMahon) she has two adoring daughters but does she look happy? No she looks like someone posing for Edvard Munch. This is bizarre given that Bullock is one of the few leading ladies--Meg Ryan having temporarily vanished into the mists--who know how to carry a comedy and to make that difficult burden seem as light as a kite. She has always been a frowner and a fretter but in movies past beginning with ""Speed"" those worry lines could be erased with ease; they were part of her quick-response skills and of her determination to ride the bumps of mischance. The first sin committed by Mennan Yapo the director of ""Premonition"" is that he manages to make his heroines face look at once drawn and swollen as if the sight of a pretty woman might like a dirty joke inflict frivolous damage on the drama. Tell that to Carole Lombard. Or Myrna Loy. The chronology is all chewed up with Linda waking the day after the funeral to learn that Jim is still alive then waking again to find the opposite and so on. It might have been simpler to call the movie ""Groundhog Death."" Slowly a plot emerges. Just as the two daughters are seen early on carefully putting pieces into a jigsaw puzzle--well now their mom has to solve a puzzle of her own. (""Reign Over Me"" pulls an almost identical trick. I live for these delicate hints.) Linda discovers thanks to her Sibylline gift that Jim is about to sneak off with a colleague named Claire (Amber Valletta) and that it is en route to the tryst that he will crash and burn. According to Linda ""Maybe it was supposed to happen. Even though he didnt do anything yet maybe it was enough that he was going to."" This was a new one to me ""Minority Report"" for the lustful. In short the moral of ""Premonition"" is that you can expect to be killed for wanting to sleep with Amber Valletta. According to my calculations this means that ten million Americans will die by tomorrow morning half of them in the shower. Call it dark call it spooky but somehow I knew that ""Premonition"" would be a stinker. Was it a dream or did I really foresee that Kate Nelligan would be wasted in the role of Lindas mother? Or that the name of Peter Stormare in the opening credits meant that at least one of the characters would be a menacing fruitcake? Scoff if you will but such coincidences cannot be swept aside. Listen to Lindas minister who happens to have a book of famous premonitions at hand when she drops by its weirder passages marked with yellow stickies. People who have lost their faith he says are ""empty vessels"" waiting to be filled with ungodly prophetic talents such as hers. So there you have it go to church keep your husbands gaze averted from stray blondes try not to think about the future and all shall be well. Although ""Premonition"" is not a frightening movie it is aimed squarely at an audience of frightened souls.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.
