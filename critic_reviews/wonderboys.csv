Transplanted to Mars a Civil War vet discovers a lush planet inhabited by 12-foot tall barbarians. Finding himself a prisoner of these creatures he escapes only to encounter a princess who is in desperate need of a savior. Video courtesy of Disney/Pixar. By Joe Morgenstern March 8 2012 547 p.m. ET ""John Carter"" delivers one of its precious few delights shortly after the hero a Civil War veteran from Virginia finds himself teleported to Mars. (Actually hes been telegraphed as he was in the widely beloved novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs.) Because of the planets lower gravity John is able to traverse its arid surface in mighty leaps and bounds. Yet his excitement like ours is short-lived for the movies pervasive problem is too much gravity not too little. A deadly heaviness brings Disneys would-be epic down. ENLARGE Pictured here a Martian and Taylor Kitsch (hes the one on the right) in John Carter. Walt Disney Pictures/Everett Collection That is not only saddening but mysterious. The director Andrew Stanton has given immeasurable pleasure to this planets audiences through a series of Pixar features he either directed (""WALLE"" ""Finding Nemo)"" co-directed (""A Bugs Life"") or co-wrote (those three plus ""Monsters Inc."" and the ""Toy Story"" trilogy.) All of them were animated to be sure while ""John Carter"" is live-action at least in part--the majority of the Martian creatures sweeping vistas and elaborate battles were born of bits and bytes. Still it seemed reasonable to believe that Mr. Stantons gifts in one filmmaking mode would transfer smoothly to another just as Disneys executives must have hoped that he would favor their studio with his Midas touch. (Another animation luminary Brad Bird recently directed the new ""Mission Impossible"" with great success though he had a lively script and in Tom Cruise a certified star.) Soon after ""John Carter"" starting shooting though the production was beset by poisonous buzz from pop-culture ghouls who take pleasure in predicting disaster. They noted the swelling budget which had reached a quarter-billion dollars or more and a marketing decision that changed the original title ""John Carter of Mars""--four words charged with genuine resonance--to two words with all the fizz of a low-rent fashion label. This time alas the ghouls were pretty much right. The best to be said of the weirdly inert spectacle is that the vistas are attractive in a muted way (yes Mars is red and Mars is dry but prettier colors wouldnt have constituted a crime against astronomy); the flying machines strike a nice balance between giant dragonflies and the paintings of Bruce McCall; and the battles are impressive in a routine way though it makes no sense that the heros gift for jumping should give him the power to fight his way through vast throngs of bloodthirsty adversaries. Those Martians who are green and obviously alien--theyre four-armed savages called Tharks--look like refugees from ""Avatar"" minus the Navis sexiness grace and clarity of purpose. The Tharks battles with one another and with warring clans of humanoid Martians from the cities of Helium and Zodanga are tedious interludes--four-armed is forewarned--in a narrative thats merely confusing at first when youre still interested in whos doing what to whom but eventually disjointed to the point of incoherence. (I chose to see the film in a 2-D version though its also being shown in retrofitted 3-D.) John Carter himself is less an advertisement for earthly passion than a constant reminder of how desperately the production needed a star in a title role; the buff and handsome Taylor Kitsch gives a flat performance of snoozifying earnestness. Fugitive feelings do surface during quiet moments between John and the beautiful Heliumite princess Dejah Thoris with whom he falls in love and then joins forces to save her dying planet. (Shes played attractively and nearly convincingly by Lynn Collins.) Most of the time though neither the two leads nor a supporting cast that includes Mark Strong and Dominic West seem to be having any fun. Its as if ""John Carter"" were a fire pit with plenty of kindling and logs but no one could find a match. So whats the source of this baffling failure? Does it lie in the size of the budget? Not likely Pixars peerless entertainments have hardly come cheap. Or the difference between live action and the computer process that Pixar pioneered then raised to the level of dramatic art? Thats surely part of it--an animation director inexperienced at getting the best or avoiding the worst from the indifferent cast hes been given to work with. But it doesnt explain the emotional disconnections in the production or in the script which Mr. Stanton wrote with Mark Andrews a Pixar stalwart and Michael Chabon whose novel ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier amp; Clay"" just about defined the glories of American comic strips. Not only is there a lack of chemistry between John Carter and his Martian princess but between Carter and Woola the lumpy unfunny creature who eagerly follows him wherever he goes; this in a movie directed by the man who created exquisite love scenes between a life-detector robot and a garbage compactor. Nor does it address--to move away from Mr. Stanton the field marshal of a small army--the deficits of production design and computer imagery or explain why the score by the usually brilliant Michael Giacchino should be so undistinguished to put it mildly. If I wanted to hazard a guess--nothing but a guess based on whats up there on the screen--Id say that corporate culture was a significant culprit. Pixar the matrix of the filmmakers prior triumphs has been notable for its stable management and for a collegial atmosphere in which warm support combines with brutally honest exchanges of ideas. In recent years Disney the show-business behemoth that now owns Pixar has been riven by managerial upheavals and has never been accused of collegiality. This new Disney film marked by myriad lapses and marketing follies bears the woefully familiar earmarks of a big studio production that was pulled and hauled every which way until it lost all shape and flavor. Thats not to say pure art fell victim to vile commerce--only that ""John Carter"" looks like it went through an unearthly version of the internecine warfare on Mars. Footnote Watch a clip of ""Footnote"". Eliezer and Uriel Shkolnik are father and son as well as rival professors in Talmudic Studies. When both men learn that Eliezer will be lauded for his work their complicated relationship reaches a new peak. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. The subtext of ""Footnote"" is savagery--not that of Martian Tharks but of rival Talmudic scholars in Israels Hebrew University. The text not so simply is text--the Talmud in its manifold historical versions. Joseph Cedars wise and playful comedy of intellectual manners in subtitled Hebrew could be called ""Almost All in the Family"" since it focuses on a rivalry between father and son. Eliezer Shkolnik played with wonderfully grave demeanor by Shlomo Bar Aba is a senior lecturer with a reputation for meticulous research but the fruits of his lifelong labors are bitter; instead of receiving the Israel Prize his nations top honor for scholarship he has become a mere footnote in other scholars books. Uriel Shkolnik (Lior Ashkenazi) Eliezers middle-aging son may be a glib popularizer by comparison to his pop but he doesnt lack for the adulation that Eliezer craves. Instead of a chip off the old block hes the most proximate reason for a permanent chip on the old mans shoulder. ENLARGE Lior Ashkenazi and Shlomo Bar Aba in Footnote. Sony Pictures Classics All of this might have been no more than the basis of a rich character study but the writer-director Mr. Cedar has devised an intricate ironic plot thats set in motion by a thunderclap call to Eliezers cellphone The Israel Prize has finally come his way. I wont reveal any of the delicious complications that ensue or discuss the slightly surreal climax but one of the best scenes intensely serious yet delicately flavored with Marx Brothers lunacy involves a hurriedly arranged convocation of six men and one nervous woman in a Ministry of Education office big enough for three. And ""Footnote"" does function as a character study an exceptionally rich one. The more we learn about Eliezer who walks with a forbidding forward tilt and dispenses approval to no one the more we understand Uriels anxious need for acclaim. A mere footnote the father may be but hes written a life script for the son. Friends With Kids A decade ago Jennifer Westfeldt starred in a fine independent feature ""Kissing Jessica Stein"" which she wrote with Heather Juergensen. It was a dating-game comedy with a twist. Lovelorn Jessica turned off by the dreary men she meets replies impulsively to a personals ad in the women-seeking-women section. Her decision leads to a lesbian affair thats as charming as it is complicated. Now Ms. Westfeldt has written and directed a straight comedy with herself in another starring role. Once again theres a twist but no charm at all. Watch a clip of ""Friends With Kids"". Two best friends decide to have a child together while keeping their relationship platonic so they can avoid the toll kids can take on romantic relationships. Video courtesy of Roadside Attractions. She plays Julie whose biological clock has developed a stentorian tick. Instead of marrying Julie enters into a pact with a lifelong friend Jason (Adam Scott). Theyll have a baby then share custody while continuing to date other people. Its the perfect solution the anticouple agrees to procreating while still preserving romance in their respective lives. Why they would want to have a baby is another question given the horrors that child-raising brings to the lives of their married friends--domestic quarrels endless encumbrance and soon enough in the case of their own kid serial attacks of explosive diarrhea. Its not a pretty picture in any sense. ""Friends With Kids"" wants to be a broad satire of American mores. (The equipment required for a parents-and-child expedition to a local park is roughly equivalent to what climbers carry forth from base camp on Mount Everest.) But its shrill in tone awash in unexamined narcissism--kids are just pretexts for laughs rather than objects of love--and afflicted by explosive verbal diarrhea. Theres simply no base line of normal human activity let alone intimacy until the anticouple finally re-examines their anticommitment credo. By then everyone has been so selfish and dislikable that our commitment to the film is lost. The cast includes Kristen Wiig Chris ODowd Maya Rudolph Jon Hamm and Megan Fox whose character though marginal manages to outshallow everyone else. DVD Focus The War of the Worlds (1953) Mars invades Earth in this sci-fi classic based on an H.G. Wells novel which George Pal produced in 1953. (The film won an Oscar for special effects.) Watching the march of the Martian machines across our country youre taken in not by the dazzling reality of the visual tricks but by their resourcefulness and charming artificiality. In our digital age when anything is possible movie magic can be daunting or assaultive. Half a century ago special effects were invitations to willing wonderment. That said Steven Spielbergs 2005 remake with Tom Cruise and fancier effects is enjoyable too. Wonder Boys (2000) Michael Chabon wrote the novel that Steve Kloves adapted for Curtis Hanson to direct. Michael Douglas is Grady Tripp once a wonder boy but now a pothead teacher of creative writing. Tobey Maguire is James Leer Gradys best student. He is also an extravagantly gifted liar if not a budding lunatic. The movie set in Pittsburgh starts as a screwball comedy about the professors travails and his students knack for making them worse. Sneakily though and ever so adroitly the film invests Gradys absurdity with humanity and his thwarted hopes with possibilities while tracking his roundabout journey to true love. Bridesmaids (2011) Two of the three leading women in ""Friends With Kids""--Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph--starred in last years comedy hit but Im bringing up the film again because Chris ODowd in an inspired piece of casting was in it too. Hes the man behind the radar gun an Irish cop named Rhodes who speaks with gentle humor and unforced wisdom whether hes citing Ms. Wiigs forlorn maid of honor Annie for dysfunctional taillights or confronting her to her confusion and dismay with indisputable evidence of her competence.

Michael Cavaias The coming-of-age genre gets a delectably original reworking in ""Wonder Boys "" Curtis Hansons eagerly awaited follow-up to ""L.A. Confidential."" This superbly mounted screwball comedy centers on the midlife crisis of a college professor whos pushed by forces beyond his control into maturity and responsibility. In his most nuanced performance to date Michael Douglas heads an ensemble film in which every part is splendidly cast. Adapted by Steve Kloves from Michael Chabons 1995 novel pic is witty and sophisticated in a way that will appeal to mature and educated viewers although the Paramount release will need strong critical support; while it is a gratifying entertainment of leisurely elegance and delicious nastiness the film lacks obvious appeal and commercial hooks in todays youth-dominated market. Hopping from genre to genre with apparent ease Hanson shows that he is a director able to locate through dexterous mise-en-scene the distinctive elements of each film whether a psychological thriller (""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"") a routine actioner (""The River Wild"") or a sublime noirish crimer (""L.A. Confidential""). His first foray into comedy ""Wonder Boys"" distinguishes itself as a character-driven piece in which the astute humor is intrinsic to the bizarre situations and endless crises in which the characters find themselves. After countless comedies set in high school a locale determined as much by an obsession with youth in American culture as by demographics of the moviegoing public its refreshing to see a campus comedy populated largely by grownups. Unlike most coming-of-age sagas ""Wonder Boys"" chronicles the rites of passage of a middle-aged man. Pushing 50 Grady Tripp (Douglas) an English professor who was once the wonder boy and darling of the literati is unable to finish his new novel which has grown to humongous proportions. Consumed with fear that it will fail to live up to his masterpiece published seven years earlier he toys with various endings while the new book sits waiting to be rescued. In the first scene a sensitive student in Gradys writing class named James Leer (Tobey Maguire) reads from his work and the other classmates provide ""constructive"" criticism. Grady immediately recognizes James talent but what he cannot realize is the crucial role the boy will play in his career and emotional life. In a marvelous twist on the convention of heterosexual couples in screwball comedy the picture centers the narrative on a new type of a romantic (though not gay) duo a distressed professor and his suicidal student who may be a pathological liar. As a comedy-adventure ""Wonder Boys"" follows the logic of a road movie with Grady and James driving around and encountering one bizarre situation after another. To say that Grady is having a bad day is an understatement. When the story begins his wife has left him and soon after he is informed by his lover college chancellor Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand) whose husband Walter (Richard Thomas) is the head of the English department and thus Gradys boss that she is pregnant and has not decided what to do with their baby. Complicating the situation and increasing Gradys anxieties is the universitys literary festival Wordfest which brings the commercial interests into the insular ivy-tower academic environment. Its crisis time accentuated by the presence of Q (Rip Torn) the older self-satisfied writer who serves as the symbol of success that Grady once had. Early on there is a wonderful sequence a literati party that vividly captures a typical college soiree in which talk ranges from existential philosophy to sleazy gossip. Gradys flamboyant editor Terry (a splendid Robert Downey Jr.) arrives with the tall elegant Miss Sloviak (Michael Cavaias) who as everyone suspects is a transvestite. As soon as Terry lays his eyes on James  a romantic infatuation begins leading to some surprising results. Each of the eccentric characters is marvelously introduced and integrated into the tale. Included among them is Hannah (Katie Holmes) a student of Gradys who rents a room in his house and displays an unabashed desire to be part of his life. In this as in other respects pic is emotionally true in showing a student with an overwhelming crush on an older teacher. Pic has its share of hilariously rude moments some of which involve Walters dog and a jacket that supposedly belonged to Marilyn Monroe. Among the subplots that enrich the central thread is one concerning Vernon Hardapple (Richard Knox)  who mysteriously stalks Grady and Oola (Jane Adams) Vernons pregnant g.f. Fresh observations provide unpredictable twists that escalate into a series of tragicomic incidents. Kloves who wrote and directed ""The Fabulous Baker Boys "" is deft at portraying losers ""Wonder Boys"" could be described as a comedy about the gallantry of defeat. His faithful rendition of Chabons novel maintains the authors wicked sharp-tongued humor. Boasting a crazy kind of sweetness pic exudes tremendous charm a result of impeccable timing right tone and flawless performances. What comes through in each role is an improbable  almost romantic affection for the character that sets the mood for the whole movie. Under Hansons guidance Douglas shows a real comedic flair seldom tapped before. He digs deeply into the nuttiness without camping it up or winking at the audience. As his romantic partner McDormand excels in a quiet understated perf that differs from earlier efforts. Rest of the large cast particularly Downey is equally accomplished. Collaborating again with ""L.A. Confidential"" lenser Dante Spinotti Hanson gives his film which was shot in wintry Pittsburgh a deliberately unpolished and deceptively casual look. Dede Allens masterful editing underlines the rich characterization and brings snap to the storytelling. The movies frivolous touches and eccentric details emphasize its dry measured wit and the power of comedy to underscore serious ideas. Massively inventive ""Wonder Boys"" is spiked with fresh perverse humor that flows naturally from the straight-faced playing. Soundtrack spiked by flavorful pop tunes is highlighted by Bob Dylans first new recorded song in three years ""Things Have Changed.""

With his red scarf and tortoise shell glasses his elegantly tousled graying preppie hair Grady is the campus resident dissolute literary intellectual a glamourpuss in tweed. Gallant and reckless hes the sort of fellow who flirts with a pretty adoring student (Katie Holmes) and then demonstrates his high scruples by sleeping with a colleagues wife instead. As a movie ""Wonder Boys"" is a lot like Grady sweet flaky and more than a little aimless. The director Curtis Hanson may be working out a few sophomore jitters of his own. His last film the incendiary 50s underworld labyrinth ""L.A. Confidential"" was the first to win him acclaim as an artist and ""Wonder Boys"" adapted by Steve Kloves (""The Fabulous Baker Boys"") from a 1995 novel by Michael Chabon feels like an overly considered change up. Its Hansons attempt to do something shaggy and adventurous and offbeat but as refreshing as it is to see a movie take an open eyed view of life on campus Id have liked ""Wonder Boys"" better if it werent so whimsical and precious - a series of conceits posing as characters. Every relationship in ""Wonder Boys"" is freighted with Thematic Significance yet the movie also spends much of its time laboring to be wacky and lighthearted. For every ruefully funny scene of Grady and his academic comrades trying to wrest some truth out of what they do there are five others in which Grady frets over his stolen car or limps around after being bitten by the chancellors dog. The films central bond is the one between Grady and his most gifted student a theatrically morose writer named James Leer (Tobey Maguire) whose penchant for stealing and for making up most of what he says may just mark him as a born novelist. Maguire who in ""The Cider House Rules"" seemed to have come down with a bad case of the gawks gives James a creepy winsomeness; this young actor was born to play cerebral misfits - with his baby owl stare he keeps you focused on what hes ""not"" saying. ""Wonder Boys"" tries to turn James into a portrait of the artist as a young poseur freak. In a bit of slapstick mayhem he shoots and kills that offending dog and the movie ends up making more absurd rib nudging references to that damn dead pooch - it gets stowed in Gradys trunk - than youd expect to see in a David Spade comedy. Even at its crudest ""Wonder Boys"" is never less than affectionate yet its also rather lackluster. Curtis Hanson may have wanted to make a movie that gleamed with humanity as much as ""L.A. Confidential"" burned with malevolence but hes so intent on getting us to like his characters that he didnt give them enough juice.

Wonder Boys Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2000) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/wonder-boys-2000,200,wonderboys4,wonderboys,rogerebert
"Wonder Boys | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wonder-boys ) Wonder Boys (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Back in mid-90s director Curtis Hanson was known as a B-list filmmaker - someone who could cull a fair amount of tension out of workmanlike stories such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. All of that changed in 1997 however when Hanson helmed L.A. Confidential. The film became an instant critical success and Hanson was elevated to the level of a director whose next effort was anticipated. Now three years later that ""next effort"" has arrived and its a far different creature than its moody atmospheric predecessor. Due in large part to the contribution of veteran cinematographer Dante Spinotti Wonder Boys looks as good as L.A. Confidential (the winterscapes in this film are breathtakingly beautiful) but theres nothing noir-ish about this genial dramatic comedy. Wonder Boys uses a standard premise - the older wiser father figure who both teaches and learns from his protA(c)gA(c) - as a starting-off point. While its true that familiarity can breed contempt and too many movies of this sort veer into overly-sentimental melodrama Wonder Boys manages to keep audiences involved despite its less-than-original underlying idea. There are two obvious reasons for this. The first is tone - the film successfully shifts from comedy to poignancy without the awkwardness that often mars such transitions and it never goes overboard in either category. The second is characters. The men and women inhabiting this film feel like real people not recycled caricatures from other similar motion pictures. Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas looking worn out and unkempt) is a celebrated English professor at a small university. Once upon a time Grady was regarded as a literary luminary but it has been seven years since his critically acclaimed Arsonists Daughter was published. His editor Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.) is itching to release the much anticipated follow-up but the author keeps putting him off. It isnt that Grady is suffering from writers block but he cant figure out how to end his lastest novel - an epic endeavor that is at least twice the length of War amp; Peace. Meanwhile Gradys personal life is a mess. His wife has left him. His married girlfriend Sarah Gaskell (Frances McDormand) who also happens to be the colleges chancellor is pregnant with his child. And a student named Hannah (Katie Holmes) who rents a room in his house has a huge crush on him. Then theres the strange case of James Leer (Tobey Maguire) a brooding young man with unlimited writing potential. Grady decides to take James under his wing and teach him a little about life. The experience turns out to be much different than Grady anticipated. Wonder Boys is about the relationship between Grady and James and the importance of storytelling to both of them. The films other characters are secondary and often serve little purpose beyond acting as catalysts. In fact Gradys wife is so unimportant that she never makes an appearance in the flesh (although we do catch a glimpse of her in a photograph). Wonder Boys explores themes that most of us can relate to chasing the dreams of youth taking risks and making a commitment and finding and pursuing something of meaning. In addition to using it as a symbol Wonder Boys has a fair amount to say about the craft of writing. The movie takes place against the backdrop of the schools annual ""Wordfest"" a gathering of world-renowned writers. Gradys life is defined by his writing but he has lost his zest for it. With glum cynicism he takes a look at todays society and comments ""Books dont mean anything - not anymore."" When he speaks those words he is like a once devout man who has lost his faith. His current opus turns out to be hollow and shallow despite its great length. Even the adoring Hannah recognizes that it is written without passion. And in James Grady sees an element of what he has lost. In reference to his pupil he says ""Sometimes people just need to be rescued"" but hes really talking about himself. More often than not Michael Douglas is known for playing suave debonair men. In Wonder Boys he has no trouble essaying someone who cares little for his physical appearance. Douglas performance is on the mark and theres not one moment during this film in which he would be mistaken for a sex symbol. Rising star Tobey Maguire (The Cider House Rules) isnt quite as good. James is supposed to be a cold fish with passion simmering just beneath the surface - Maguires interpretation makes him seem too flat at times as if theres nothing beneath the cool exterior. Frances McDormand is delightful and Katie Holmes despite having little to do shows that shes a more capable actress than many of the would-bes of her generation. Then theres Robert Downey Jr. whose off-screen baggage adds a dimension to his fine performance as the Epicurean Crabtree.

Starring Michael Douglas Tobey Maguire and Frances McDormand. Directed by Curtis Hanson. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its a tricky thing to make a movie about a writer struggling to finish a novel. Aside from the obvious -- the act of writing is not exactly cinematic -- there is the task of convincing the audience that the character can really write and that hes writing something worth reading. ""Wonder Boys"" director Curtis Hansons first film since ""L.A. Confidential"" stars Michael Douglas as Grady a 50-year-old novelist who scored a big success with his first book seven years before and hasnt completed anything since. Grady lives his life in the cozy but airless atmosphere of the academy teaching writing at a university in Pittsburgh. Douglas leaves no doubt that Grady is a writer. The problem is that he seems like a bad writer a coddled aging adolescent sitting in front of his typewriter in his bathrobe getting stoned. In a more honest film it would be understood that Grady is the very picture of the no-talent academic with no imagination or life experience. But ""Wonder Boys"" never stops insisting he is an artist. It shows strangers approaching Grady to tell him how much his first novel ""The Arsonists Daughter"" meant to them. The title itself sounds suspect. Fortunately once we get past our skepticism (that a 50-year-old pothead who spends his life talking to college students has something to say about the human condition) the movie has some amusing moments. ""Wonder Boys"" which opens today takes place over the course of a long weekend and packs a lot in. Gradys wife leaves him one morning and that evening he finds out that the chancellor of his college (Frances McDormand) a married woman is pregnant with his child. He has to decide what to do. In the meantime a writers conference is being held at the university bringing in literary types from all over the country. Rip Torn has a nice role as an outrageously successful novelist who begins a lecture by pronouncing in his most grave and pompous tone ""I . . . am a writer."" Also at the conference is Crabtree Gradys editor played by Robert Downey Jr. who provides the one consistent point of light in the picture. Crabtree was a ""wonder boy"" himself. Ten years before he was a hot young editor but now he needs a hit. In a movie in which every other character is vague ambivalent or drug-addled Downey plays Crabtree with crispness and invention. He wants to see Gradys manuscript which it turns out has grown into almost 3000 single-spaced pages. Tobey Maguire plays Gradys student James an up-and-comer who keeps cranking out material. James is an elusive character who carries a gun writes depressive stories and leads a solitary life. A series of circumstances throws the two writers together and the contrast between youthful enthusiasm and burned-out middle age is made explicit. Hanson does his best to create a world for ""Wonder Boys"" something he did quite effectively in ""L.A. Confidential."" This world is one of 100-year-old brick buildings and lecture halls populated by an insulated enclave in which everyone knows each other. Too bad Hanson lets himself get taken in by the academys vision of itself and presents Grady and his circle in sentimental terms as a flawed but valiant community of artists. Hanson even expects us to buy Katie Holmes as a published author. She may be a sensitive young actress but what is she 19? Its hard to imagine any decent writing coming out of Gradys classroom. The sentimentality overtakes ""Wonder Boys"" when in the last half hour it tries to make nice with its characters and fashion a deep message from a trivial story. The result is something rare an emotionally dishonest movie about emotionally dishonest people. ..
