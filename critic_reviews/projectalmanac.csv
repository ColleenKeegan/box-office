The Michael Bay-produced teen-driven film lies at the ambitious intersection of the time-travel and found-footage genres The former boasts a long list of well-loved forbears including Back to the Future Interstellar Donnie Darko Looper Groundhog Day Time Cop and Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure many of which Project Almanac references in the film. Time travel has a kind of universal appeal; it plays on audiences desires for puzzle-like narrative complexity and what-if fantasies.Related Story The Formula Thats Ruining Teen Movies On the other hand since its mainstream introduction with The Blair Witch Project in 1999 found footage hasnt aged quite as well. Long associated with the horror genre the descriptor ""found footage"" is over-used and poorly defined while the movies to which its attached are rarely well-executed. The criticisms lobbed at most found-footage films consistently echo those recently and perhaps fairly leveled at Project Almanac chiefly that the label is an excuse to make a relatively low-budget movie with lazy storytelling shallow characters and obnoxiously shaky camera work. Nevertheless the disjointed and deeply self-conscious nature of the found-footage format works feels surprisingly honest and timely in teen-centered films like this one.The premise of the film (formerly and awkwardly known as Welcome to Yesterday) is fairly simple Nerdy-but-attractive high school genius David Raskin (Jonny Reston) gets into his dream college and wants to make a last-ditch effort to win a scholarship by coming up with a brilliant science experiment. The discovery of a strange home video from Davids seventh birthday leads him his sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) and his friends Adam (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn (Sam Lerner) to find a time machine prototype left behind by Davids father a brilliant scientist who died a decade earlier. After some experimenting they get the machine to work and go back in time to do various young-people things (win the lottery go to Lollapalooza) but inadvertently and invariably they cause a lot of bad tragic stuff to happen along the way.From a purely technical and aesthetic standpoint the found-footage style does almost nothing for the movie raising more questions than it intends to answer. Like others of its ilk Project Almanac cant seem to make up its mind about committing to the found-footage approach or not (Where is the mood-setting music coming from? Why are there multiple POV shots? Why did Christina start obsessively filming way before her brother told her to start documenting everything?) And for those who watch the trailer Project Almanac will be a sci-fi film with few surprises. The kids use their ""temporal relocation device"" for fairly innocuous expected purposes to win the validation or love of a super popular/hot classmate to re-do a chemistry class to punish a bully to be seen as cool in the eyes of their high school.But its in this context--Project Almanac as an earnest yet flawed depiction of teen wishes and fears--that the filmmaking approach takes on new significance. The genre dramatizes the identity formation that goes on during the digital technology-glutted adolescent years which are filled with screens and captured images whether from smartphones cameras vlogging or pictures on social media. While earlier in the 20th century popular culture more frequently imagined the camera as a voyeuristic tool (see Alfred Hitchcocks Rear Window) the reality of recording has been far more normalized today even if it hasnt lost its insidious potential. For the most part characters in films like Project Almanac act like themselves unfazed by the camera ever-trained on them.Others such as The Dissolves Scott Tobias have also noted the distinctly modern appeal of found footage in lending a sense of verisimilitude. But its a truthfulness that has particular resonance with the teenage experience. In Project Almanac there isnt just the main audience-POV camera. There are mirrors Facebook photos Instagram videos many of which capture the teens doing things they dont remember because they happened in an alternate-time universe. The films found footage approach emphasizes this weird alienation not as deeply creepy in the way that horror films tend to but as a fairly normal part of being a digitally connected teen. (To understand this sense of alienation all you need to do is go to your earliest Facebook posts or your MySpace or your LiveJournal).Teens face the added anxiety of literally seeing themselves as others see them.Teens--already notorious for their self-consciousness and broader concern with social acceptance--face the added anxiety of literally seeing themselves as others see them. This idea of split selves made more fantastical as when David sees his older self reflected in the mirror at his own seventh birthday party serves a narrative purpose in a time travel story. Video cameras in effect create two different types of realities the lived experience of the person being recorded and the image that will be captured for posterity. The filmmaking style inadvertently highlights the role screens play in how David and his friends view themselves as people uncool girlfriend-less.Found-footage films add an extra layer of self-awareness both on the part of the subjects and on the part of the audience. The characters in the recordings know theyre being recorded and the audience knows this too. But for the teens this is no different than with YouTube videos or Instagram selfies or Snapchats. Hence the awkward glance David casts toward the camera as his crush Jessie (Sofia Black DElia) inches closer to him. Or when a more transparently performative aspect creeps in to how the characters behave as when Christina turns to the camera slyly and pulls her shirt off to reveal a bikini top while at Lollapalooza. If much of this feels grating or forced its at least comforting to know that theres some truth to it.Recall found footages ubiquity in the horror genre where the original idea is that the people were watching are no longer around to tell their stories and all thats left is the recording. Many of these films Project Almanac included dont quite go so far as to kill off all their characters but the recording is meant to serve more as a document a kind of digital memory for the teens themselves. In a ""pics or it didnt happen"" age where anything that matters should be preserved and shared this intention is all the more sympathetic. Which perhaps explains the recent spread of found footage to teen movies such as Project X Chronicle Earth to Echo and of course horror films like the atrocious Megan Is Missing or the upcoming Unfriended. The genre may feel worn-out but found footage seems to have found a new and natural home in youth-driven films.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The premise has been done to death but screenwriters Andrew Stark and Jason Pagan give it a fresh and pleasant spin by using it as a vehicle for adolescent wish fulfillment--the kids arrange for themselves to win the lottery contrive to manipulate their academic and social lives etc. The disastrous ripple effects are well handled too; the ringleader jumps back again and again in hope of rectifying them but every adjustment creates more problems. Unfortunately someone decided to shoot this as mock cinema verite supposedly captured by one of the kids on a ten-year-old camcorder though the jiggly images are higher definition than youd expect and there are the usual narrative convolutions to capture moments that probably wouldnt have been.

Wednesday January 28 2015 at 4 a.m. By Simon Abrams Photo by Photo credit Guy DAlema - (c) 2015 Paramount Pictures. All Rights Reserved. The makers of Project Almanac a ponderous found-footage time-travel drama tellingly waste 40 minutes cataloging banal uses for time travel before establishing their films generic main conflict What if going back in time causes more harm than good? Painfully shy teenager David (Jonny Weston) discovers his dead fathers time machine but learns that he cant improve the past without messing up the future after he uses it to make popular girl Jessie (Sofia Black-DElia) fall in love with him. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Until then Project Almanac aimlessly follows David and his friends unimaginative power fantasies The group cheats to win the lottery and Davids sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) gets back at a bully by materializing out of nowhere to soak her tormentor with soda. Most of these scenes arent essential to the films plot and none of them are much fun especially since theyre all shot with hyper-shaky camerawork.That ugly unfocused photography makes it impossible to enjoy the film beyond its theoretical novelty. Its interesting to think about buying expired VIP passes for a concert and then going back in time to use them. But all we see of David and his friends traipsing around Lollapalooza is a palsied backstage recording of Vampire Weekend followed by David and Jessies equally muddy-looking -- and chemistry-less -- post-concert tryst. Project Almanac could have been fun but its creators dont seem to know what fun looks like.Film Details Project Almanac RatingPG-13 GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time120 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Simon Abrams Follow simonsaybrams Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Project Almanac | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; project-almanac ) Project Almanac (United States 2015) January 30 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Call Project Almanac a ""shaky-cam special"" and its a damn shame. The resultant production both shaken and stirred transforms a potentially entertaining pulp time travel story into a misbegotten exercise in frustration. It takes what might have been a moderately enthusiastic ""thumbs up"" and turns it into a ""thumbs down."" It makes one lament how enjoyable these 108 minutes might have been had the filmmakers not been misled into thinking that ""found footage"" was anything more than a tired gimmick whose effectiveness and welcome have been worn out for a long time. Maybe it will work better on home video where unrestrained camera movement is less likely to provoke nausea but it certainly doesnt work on a big screen. If Chronicle asked the question of how a group of emotionally unready teenagers might cope with being granted superpowers Project Almanac travels a similar road with respect to time travel. This isnt intended to be hard-core science fiction and doesnt come across as such. Its not overly interested in things like predestination paradoxes and falls short in the ""think it through"" mental exercises that accompany high-end time travel movies. But theres a kernel of truth in all of this because most teenagers trapped in their high school bubble would be tempted to use time travel to do things that older people might consider inconsequential or self-absorbed. And they probably have never heard of ""the butterfly effect."" Project Almanac wonders what five high school kids might do if they came into possession of a time machine. They are David Raskin (Jonny Weston) the genius who takes his late fathers research to the next level; Davids hot blond sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) who has a compulsion to film everything; Davids geeky buddies Quinn (Sam Lerner) and Adam (Allen Evangelista); and Jessie (Sofia Black-DElia) the girl of Davids dreams. At first when he realizes what he has David wants to take things slowly - start with small experiments and build to bigger things but his friends arent patient. So its not long before the quintet has made a successful jump 24 hours into the past. They quickly learn that time travel can be dangerous so they implement a rule no solo jumping. For a while the friends use time travel as a recreational device a way to relive ""good"" days re-do tests take revenge on snooty girls who harass Christina win the lottery and pursue second chance romances. But when David breaks the rule they learn theres a dark side to all of this. Its easy enough to have fun with the possibilities raised by Project Almanac without treating this as anything more than light disposable entertainment. The characters are nicely drawn and theres something endearing about the uncertainty with which David approaches Jessie. The problem I have is the way first-time director Dean Israelite chooses to tell the story. I assume the reason this movie is presented from a first-person perspective is because of a desire to mimic Chronicle. That doesnt make it a good idea. In fact video capture by a character in all these situations is more nonsensical than usual for this sort of movie. And for the viewer being forced to watch an entire movie shot with movement and jitter is enough to generate a headache. Its worse than a distraction; its an abomination. And theres no reason for it. The first rule of the found footage/first person approach is that it should be used sparingly and only when theres a compelling reason to do so. Project Almanac offers no such reason. In fact a strong case could be made that this would be a better movie had it been filmed using a steadycam or at least a tripod. Its curious how popular the concept of time travel has become in recent years whether in serious endeavors like Looper or Interstellar or less hardcore offerings like the belatedly popular Doctor Who or the mind-bending Predestination. Project Almanac is probably the least ambitious of the recent crop of productions but the style in which its made makes this a dubious choice for an investment of the commodity it plays games with time.

The smart and super-slick teen time-machine pictureA Project AlmanacA is the latest incarnation of this would-coulda-shoulda pipe-dream -- a movie so knowing that its characters referenceA LooperA Groundhog Day and maybe five other films that lay out the pros and cons of rewriting the past. Theyve seen what happens but they never learn The visual wrinkle in Project Almanac is that its shot with one or two video cameras wielded by the characters which struck me as dumb (as well as nausea-inducing) at the start but proves to be a cool device for our heroes to look at what theyve just done and go back and do it differently. (Once somethings on video it evidently cant be altered the way the rest of reality can which could be a metaphor for something.) Its a video that kicks off the whole saga. The tall cute teenage physics wonk David Raskin (Jonny Weston) and his blonde leggy sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) find a camera belonging to their long-dead dad in which the teenage David can be glimpsed in a mirror at his own 7-year-old birthday party After the requisite repetition of ""WTF""s the two also uncover what appears to be the heart of a temporal shifter (i.e. time-travel device) that needs only hydrogen a suitable power generator and some [fill in tech specs] to get going backwards. Davids pals -- the horny Jewish nerd Quinn (Sam Lerner) and Asian-American Allen (Adam Le) -- provide both assistance and banter and the team is joined at the last minute by Davids dark leggy crush Jessie (Sofia Black DElia). Much of Project Almanac is straight-out goofy romantic wish-fulfillment winning the lottery so Davids mom wont have to sell their house to pay for his tuition to MIT buying a Maserati going back to and backstage at Coachella ... The friends agree that when they go theyll all go together because you know what happens when people are careless in the past (butterfly wings and all that). The problem is that poor David is too much of a cowardly twerp to tell Jessie he likes her which drives the disappointed Jessie off which makes David think If only Id kissed her when she said ... and then Wait a minute I can kiss her when she says ... Pretty soon hes scrawling variables all over a blackboard to try to undo the tragedies that follow. Next time someone says ""Why do I have to learn math? Im not going to be a mathematician"" you can say ""To plot all the variables in your time-travel fantasies stupid."" The mood gets pretty dark and desperate for a larkish teen pic -- a tribute to director Dean Israelite and cinematographer Matthew Lloyd who make the handheld camerawork look spontaneous but get what they need (physically and emotionally) into every frame. (One mistake The camera is supposedly held by Gardners Christina whos too pretty to keep behind the lens for most of the film.) Michael Bay was an executive producer which might account for the female leads preference for tight tops and short-shorts while the males are allowed to be as fundamentally dweebish as Bay. But on the whole this is a good B-movie that hits it modest marks. Project Almanac is also one of those studio products that have obviously been tested and re-tested with target audiences -- which when you think about it is just like our time-travel ideal. The audience gets restless during one scene so you go back and trim it and serve it up again. Maybe the new version screws up a transition to the next scene so you go back and readjust rewriting the past until the audience gives you As on their test sheets and at last you can say ""This is the way it should have been -- and now it is.""

Project Almanac or as a cynic might call it David Jesse Quinn Adam amp; Christinas Bogus Looper-Light Adventure is a Michael Bay-branded time-travel fiasco made for teens and seemingly by them too.Excitable dude-saying high schoolers find an incomplete temporal relocation device in the basement and even though the house shakes with crazy levels of electromagnetic energy the mother never once pokes her head down into the basement and asks what are you darn kids up to? (Their caffeinated mannerisms coupled with the jittery hand-held filming makes for exhausting viewing.) The kids are up to rewinding the clock to win a lottery pass a chemistry test and attend Lollapalooza. David (Jonny Weston) is the best looking nerd ever and yet needs the device to perfect a romantic moment with the photogenic and sweet Jessie.Events ripple out of hand though. David races - yes against time - to fix history and future. By the time the deja-view dud screeches to an end and youve just lost 106 minutes youll never get back.

""Project Almanac"" plays fast and loose with its time travel premise and as such it falls apart when it should be revving up.David Raskin (Jonny Weston) is an MIT-bound high school student who finds a videotape of his 7th birthday party and notices something strange in the background of one of the shots himself present day.This leads to him discovering the blueprints for a time machine his late father left behind. He and his friends experiment with it and eventually crack the code jumping back in time to ace pop quizzes in science class and the like. They up the ante and win the lotto and then head to that Lollapalooza they all missed. But when David starts messing with time and space to get the popular girl (Sofia Black-DElia) to like him the ripple effects begin disrupting the world.""Project Almanac"" gets several things right. The teens feel like real teens and of course theyd go to music festivals buy Maseratis hook up food trucks for their friends and use time travel to pump up their Instagram followers. It also is smart enough to reference its predecessors such as ""Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure"" ""The Terminator"" ""Timecop"" and ""Doctor Who."" (At one point one of the characters uses ""Groundhog Day"" as a verb.)But when things get heavy the movie gets shaky. (Theyre actually shaky throughout given its needless ""found footage"" aesthetic and the tiresome shaky cam visual style that comes with the territory.) We all understand the butterfly effect but ""Project Almanac"" never quite explains how or why two characters falling in love results in planes dropping from the sky. Lesson learned time travel is difficult but making it work on screen is even harder.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaProject AlmanacGRADE CRated PG-13 For some language and sexual contentRunning time 106 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1CH9Ied MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2015/01/30/review-teens-discover-time-travel-shaky-project-almanac/22554959/,200,projectalmanac8,projectalmanac,detroitnews

Credit Paramount Pictures ""Project Almanac"" a teenage time-travel fable begins with its hero delivering a college admissions essay to the camera and continues to pretend that everything we see was filmed by the characters. Its the latest example of the ""found-footage"" conceit which apparently reflects a misperception among screenwriters that the filmmakers have to be part of the story or else the movie doesnt happen.That tired trick makes excitement and danger easier to portray through camerawork (and also seems to still appeal to a younger audience). The meat of the action starts when a high school science maven David (Jonny Weston) happens upon a bizarro home movie of a childhood birthday party. He then finds a time machine left in the basement by his brilliant and deceased dad. With his buddies and kid sister the earnest boy gets the device working; together they secretly use it to finagle better grades higher social standing and money.The wish fulfillment of time travel tends to be fun to watch and the director Dean Israelite feeds on the friends giddy escapades for a while whether its acing a test or attending a big concert. But the shy Davids yen for an outspoken hot girl (Sofia Black-DElia) ends up introducing the ethical quandaries expected in tales of temporal journeys.Theres some insight and humor about how finding a workaround for experience isnt the same thing as living. But nothing here matches the genres small-scale classic ""Primer"" or even ""Premature"" the recent gonzo ""Groundhog Day."" One of Davids accomplices also mentions ""Looper"" but the self-awareness doesnt save the film from fizzling.""Project Almanac"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

"Time-hopping Project Almanac doesnt transport us review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTime-hopping Project Almanac doesnt transport us reviewFound-footage teen time travel drama Project Almanac has a likeable cast but misses out on its potential to go deeper and darker.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 29 2015Project AlmanacStarring Jonny Weston Sofia Black-DElia Sam Lerner Allen Evangelista and Ginny Gardner. Directed by Dean Israelite. 106 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGThank goodness for undiscovered basement labs and dusty video cameras. Otherwise Project Almanacs generally likeable cast would have to be content with lousy grades and weak love lives.Initially it appears this frenetically filmed teen time-travel drama could be a better-than-average adventure. But bizarre camerawork and that laziest of all plot devices the stash of found footage soon slots it in the ""unrealized potential"" category.Article Continued BelowSocially awkward high school science whiz David Raskin (Jonny Weston from surf drama Chasing Mavericks) desperate for a shot at an MIT scholarship finds a freaky image from his seventh birthday party on his dead fathers video camera stashed in the attic since his death 10 years earlier.Jonny Weston left Sam Lerner and Allen Evangelista in Project Almanac a movie where the guys lead most of the action.  (Paramount Pictures)  Convinced it proves his dad had built a time machine David sets out to replicate the experiment using his fathers remarkably well-equipped basement lab which comes complete with time machine-building instructions. Hes aided by fellow outcast high school pals Adam (The Secret Life of the American Teenagers Allen Evangelista) and mouthy Quinn (Sam Lerner channeling early Miles Teller).Davids giggly younger sis Christina (Ginny Gardner) is entrusted with operating the camera to document the process -- and not much else -- which is standard in this movie where boys run the action and girls are for ignoring ogling or kissing if theyre lucky.The escalating experiments come complete with levitating tools and exploding power sources that somehow fail to bring cops or suburban neighbours running. But hooking the machine up to the car battery belonging to school siren and Davids secret crush Jessie (Gossip Girls Sofia Black-DElia) creates a new set of sparks.They skip the testing phase and get right into time travel with David making them pledge they wont time ""jump"" solo a rule we know hes destined to break as soon as he says it.They make jumps back for all the reasons any teen would including classroom do-overs Lollapalooza and revenge -- all carefully video recorded with various devices. Yet when writers Andrew Deutschman and Jason Pagan come to the consequences part of the story Project Almanac misses its potential to go deeper and darker.There are vague unpursued hints of what really happened to Davids dad. What could have been a poignant onscreen reunion is quickly dealt with and discarded.Produced by Michael Bay and held for a year before being released Project Almanacs chief annoyance is the way it was filmed using jerky shaky-cam jump cuts and handheld shots where extras wander in and out of the frame in front of actors. Its a ploy to evoke realism that annoys and distracts from the action rather than enhancing it.Occasionally smart dialogue -- a character asks ""when are we?"" after a jumping marathon -- hints at what Project Almanac could have brought to the multiplex. But we have to go Back to the Future for that kind of time-travel staying power.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Project Almanac a leap back in time not forward - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Project Almanac a leap back in time not forward Project Almanac Paramount Pictures Jonny Weston is David Raskin in ""Project Almanac."" Jonny Weston is David Raskin in ""Project Almanac."" (Paramount Pictures) Martin Tsai The Project Almanac characters do one smart thing They time-travel to buy a winning Powerball ticket In Hollywoods seemingly endless quest to use the found-footage gimmick to resuscitate any subgenre we have the new time-travel movie ""Project Almanac.""The film self-consciously name-drops ""Looper"" although it probably has more in common with the comparatively no-frills ""Back to the Future."" Desperate for ideas for a scholarship proposal incoming Massachusetts Institute of Technology freshman David (Jonny Weston) rummages through his late scientist fathers personal effects in the attic. He uncovers an old home video of his seventh birthday party and catches a glimpse of his present-day self in the footage. That leads him to the garage where he finds an instructional manual for building a time-machine prototype.David makes a pact with his sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) best pals Quinn (Sam Lerner) and Adam (Allen Evangelista) and love interest Jesse (Sofia Black-DElia) to travel together in time. For once characters actually attempt what any of us would do with a time machine They travel to buy a Powerball ticket with winning numbers they know in advance.

VPCJonny Weston brings an awkward charm to his role as David in Project Almanac.(Photo Chuck Hodes Paramount Pictures)Its tough to tell whats shakier in Project Almanac the illogical premise or the nausea-inducing camera work. And how about a moratorium on the found-footage genre? What was once fresh and innovative now is tired and overdone ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).In this case paranormal activities entail time travel rather than ghosts. Lest that sound vaguely intriguing its not. The time jumps are never more than a few weeks back and involve nothing historically significant. Leave it to high schoolers to use time-travel to attend Lollapalooza or improve their test scores rather than do something more substantial.In 2007 Paramount cleverly seized upon Paranormal Activity and a phenomenon was born. But the studio still seems to be looking for its next Paranormal. Lightning does not strike twice here. And by bringing in Michael Bay as producer Almanac is as rushed and frenetic as one of the recent Transformers movies.The films logic is strained in several circumstances as the ""rules of time travel are established and then broken.The film opens with brainy David (Jonny Weston) getting accepted to MIT His mother is beaming his father would have been so proud. He was a science guy too but he died when David was 7. Weston is gently awkward and charming in the part which helps offset the distancing effect of the shaky found-footage format.His sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) is documenting Davids every move but this doesnt make events feel more contemporary or immediate. Instead its an impediment. The conceit can work such as with Earth to Echo where a young camera geek constantly filmed as his pals rode around on bikes with an alien that landed nearby. In that film events felt personal through its film-within-a film conceit. However Almanac could have used a more straightforward approach. When David doesnt get the necessary scholarship money he begins exploring his familys basement searching through his dads things for an invention something that could make him some money. David and Christina find an old video camera documenting Davids 7th birthday. Upon closer inspection they catch a glimpse of what looks like modern-day David in the background of the shot. Then they go rooting more and find a ""temporal displacement"" device -- aka a time machine. A mystery seems to surround their dads death which the story doesnt bother to explore and for all his smarts and curiosity David doesnt seem to care.The cast of unknowns is likeable enough but the movie is far too caught up in the details. Repetitive scenes of levitating tools dont convey the sense of wonder that they should.In fact. the time-travel scenes generally dont convey much excitement. For such smarty-pants teens they are remarkably unimaginative in their choices. OK they win the lottery and find ways to become popular but David has somehow determined that jumping more than three weeks back could cause someone to be stranded. A lot of time is spent seeking a powerful enough battery and power source. Hardly riveting.Its as though screenwriters Jason Pagan and Andrew Deutschman and director Dean Israelite had no idea how to conclude the story. It sends David down a dark path then abruptly ends. Talk about running on empty. 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1CE4u2V",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/01/29/project-almanac-review/22497203/,200,projectalmanac12,projectalmanac,usatoday

David (Jonny Weston left) and Quinn (Sam Lerner) work on a time-travel device using plans from Davids late father in the science fiction thriller ""Project Almanac."" Photo Guy DAlema / Associated Press Project Almanac review Fun but shallow time-travel movie 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Yet another entry in the infinite loop of time-travel movies ""Project Almanac"" is not for the faint of heart. Or should I say the weak of stomach. High on fun but low on depth ""Project Almanac"" is told entirely from the perspective of a video camera which instantly made me regret that I had eaten dinner before the screening. The film is directed by Dean Israelite but ultimately bears the imprint of producer Michael Bay who has elevated visual overload and quarter-baked storytelling to a new art form. David (Jonny Weston) discovers plans for a time machine developed by his late father. Aided by a group of friends David builds the device and hops through time so they can correct perceived injustices. But mostly just to party. The teens though lack vision. They go back to a particular day three times to help a character pass a chemistry test. Yet when the group discovers they accidentally got one number wrong on a winning lottery ticket they apparently were too lazy to try again. Kids these days As you should be well aware by now time travel has unintended consequences and David spends the rest of the film trying to clean up the escalating mess. ""Project Almanac"" generously borrows from a host of time-travel movies and even mentions a few of them. I suppose the films hook is the use of a video camera to document all of the mayhem. Unfortunately the resulting visual gymnastics supplant any real empathy we might have for these characters. I found it hard to care about anybody when I wasnt too busy trying not to get sick anyway. The video camera also undermines the films logic. Even after realizing he shouldnt mess with time David inexplicably keeps recording so ... he can have a visual record of stuff he was not supposed to see in the first place? ""There are no second chances"" David says. Except to make the same mistakes over and over. Thomas Lee is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.

Daily Edition Login to download Project Almanac Film Review 919 AM PST 1/28/2015 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A grating POV conceit adds nothing to an unimaginative time-travel pic. TWITTER Teens try using a time machine to make high school less of a drag. If the makers of the new teen time-machine flick Project Almanac could jump back in their fictional device and release the film sometime in the mid-2000s -- before Cloverfield pushed the found-footage format from indie-horror gold mine to tiresome multiplex staple before the latest wave of big-screen time-travel upped the ante on imagination -- Dean Israelites film might be quite welcome. As it is the film in which youngsters make a device that lets them leap back days or weeks in time to make high school a less punishing experience begins as a marginally fun diversion before proving to have nearly no interest in the possibilities of its premise. Business should be underwhelming but acceptable for this Michael Bay-produced time-killer but its a little poison in the well for the next outing in the genre. Jonny Weston plays David Raskin a very bright teen whose scientist dad died when he was 7. Unbeknown to the family Dad was close to perfecting a machine for DARPA that has been hidden in the basement all these years. When David and his sister find a puzzling home video in the attic (""Hey we have a video camera? We should film everything"") he soon guesses the nature of the invention and starts tinkering with it along with his tech-savvy pals. They get the thing working around the point at which the schools resident hot girl Jessie (Sofia Black-DElia) finds out and insists on joining the fun. (Know what would be more mind-blowing than time travel? Having a love interest in a studio-made teen movie who wasnt practically wearing a T-shirt saying ""hot girl"" and who contributed something to the action.) The friends agree to two rules Theyll only time-travel together and they wont try going back farther than a few weeks -- as it would require too much electricity and would force the screenwriters to engage with history instead of classroom hijinks. In addition to pulling tricks on those who have bullied them the kids help their friend Quinn (Sam Lerner) pass a Chemistry test in an over-and-over sequence that is sour instead of funny comparing poorly not only to Groundhog Day but to its recent copycat Premature. They use their gizmo to win the lottery of course and then to go to Lollapalooza where they make very public spectacles of themselves have the time of their lives and almost enjoy some romantic fantasies. Project Almanac ignores the fact that the kids get themselves all over Instagram at the music fest presumably in ways that would blow the whistle on these time-travel excursions. (The movie ignores a lot.) But the story does use this day as the springboard for its most promising subplot as David breaks his own rules in an attempt to make his life not just awesome but perfect. Briefly the movie becomes interested in the consequences of playing God building some tension as David tries frantically to fix the things he broke while mending other things in the past. Here Westons likability serves the film well; after rooted for him weve participated in his own bad judgment and are invested in his remedies. The script credited to Andrew Deutschman and Jason Harry Pagan will follow this snowballing action to a plausible and almost touching conclusion only to completely contradict itself in its final scene. But along the way Almanac is forced to cheat so much with its ostensibly self-shot material that one has to ask why the format was chosen. Not only is it hackneyed and boring by the end theres no point at which a POV scene can be expected to be more exciting than a conventional one. The tales coda offers the single instance in which the video footage serves the plot but even this development doesnt require the film itself to be seen through this clumsy lens.

( Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 29 2015 1200 PM Title Project Almanac Film Info With Jonny Weston Sofia Black-DElia. Teens discover time travel then film themselves jumping into the past. Director Dean Israelite (146). PG-13 Language. Area theaters. Every generation gets the time travel it deserves. ""Project Almanac"" isnt ""Time After Time"" (1979) or ""Back to the Future"" (1985) or ""12 Monkeys"" (1996) but the new release does turn out to be a surprisingly jaunty trip for jaded Gen-Y kids. The main conceit starts out clunky then smooths out as the story movies along. Teenage whiz kid David (Jonny Weston) discovers a box of mishmash in his dads workshop area. Dad died on Davids ninth birthday. Years later the son like dad is a nifty inventor. David needs a high school science project so with some handy instructions he finds he puts the box to the purpose intended. He constructs a time machine. At first David and his fellow-geek pals Adam (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn (Sam Lerner) along with Davids sister Christina (Ginny Gardner) send objects into the past. Then they use the machine themselves in small increments (an hour a day). They make a pact never do this alone to assure no one alters things. But they cannot help themselves. A dog who befriends them during one ""jump"" turns out to be mysteriously missing after they return to the present. When Davids crush Jessie (Sofia Black-DElia) asks if she can go along things take a tricky turn. Thats because David now realizes he can keep going back to make her fall for him. But every different past he creates makes of course a different future until David is forced to go back to the fateful afternoon of his ninth birthday. ""Project Almanac"" has plenty of the usual timeline trickery and shenanigans. Fans of the genre expect no less and this movie name-drops ""Groundhog Day"" ""Looper"" and of course Marty McFly. The script by Andrew Deutschman and Jason Pagan is relatively airtight at least insofar as time-travel movie-theory goes. Director Dean Israelite keeps the pace taut and his amiable unknown young cast reined in and on point. Thats crucial since the movie is filmed completely in iPhone and video-camcorder footage a technique that we now can see peaked back when it first hit in ""The Blair Witch Project"" (1999). Since then weve had too much of this including the film this movie resembles most ""Chronicle"" about kids coming into superpowers. The format results in too many ""Hey guys look at this"" moments and hyper-aware faux-casual behavior. But ""Project Almanac"" gets by on its own steam well enough. If only we could go back in time and convince everyone to find a different way to do this. jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Photo Credit TNS / Paramount Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A high-school engineering whiz develops a time-travel machine. BOTTOM LINE The found-footage technique is aimed at teens but surely theyre smart enough to see through the thin characters and skimpy story. An almost-enjoyable throwaway. CAST Jonny Weston Sofia Black-DElia Sam Lerner LENGTH 146 Project Almanac"" begins with a tantalizing mystery High schooler David Raskin an engineering genius who takes after his late father stumbles upon an old videotape of his seventh birthday. Theres his dad there are his friends -- and theres his current teenage self glimpsed in a mirror. Even weirder hes wearing todays T-shirt. So far so fun and for the first few minutes of ""Project Alamanac"" you might be prepared to forgive its well-worn found-footage conceit and concentrate instead on its story about a group of normal teenagers who discover the ability to time-travel. The possibilities are endless although at that age the first things that come to mind are outwitting bullies acing tests and saying the right thing to a girl. As it turns out though even something as innocent as catching a missed concert can have dire consequences. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Project Almanac"" has a likable star in Jonny Weston as the MIT-bound David but hes about the only authentic presence in this calculated youth movie that tries so hard to be hip and sling todays slang that it ends up feeling forced. The handheld camerawork feels like yesterdays zeitgeist and Davids friends are a thinly drawn collection of stock types party-hearty Quinn (Sam Lerner) amiable Asian Adam (Allen Evangelista) the improbably beautiful Jesse (Sofia Black-DElia). Davids sister Christina (Virginia Gardner) does most of the ""filming"" and is not given a personality. Its a little hard to care what happens to these characters especially when their imaginations are so limited. (Winning the lottery doesnt exactly count as a masterstroke.) The movie also takes a dim view of its main female character Jesse a trophy who develops her own thoughts only when it helps drive the plot. Directed by Dean Israelite from a script by Jason Harry Pagan and Andrew Deutschman (all making their feature-film debuts) ""Project Almanac"" might have been a little more charming if it didnt strain to hide its shortcomings with teen-culture references -- and somewhat outdated ones too. That missed concert by the way is Lollapalooza. 104 MoviesProject Almanac trailer PLOT A high-school engineering whiz develops a time-travel machine. advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Jonny Weston Sofia Black-DElia Sam Lerner LENGTH 146 BOTTOM LINE The found-footage technique is aimed at teens but surely theyre smart enough to see through the thin characters and skimpy story.

"Project Almanac review Time travel plucky teens and found footage collide; the sum is less than its parts |       OregonLive.com comments Project Almanac review Time travel plucky teens and found footage collide; the sum is less than its parts Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press Follow on Twitter on January 29 2015 at 515 AM updated January 29 2015 at 516 AM View/Post Comments What have we done to deserve another found-footage movie? The tired hand-held technique that seemed so fresh in 1999 with ""The Blair Witch Project"" long ago wore out its welcome. The only thing noteworthy about its use in ""Project Almanac"" which follows a group of high school misfits who invent a time travel apparatus is that this particular found footage film isnt really a horror film but a sci-fi thriller. Used as a means to gain an entry into the lives of these kids it makes what could have been a fresh send up of genre conventions seem as cheap and forgettable as all the rest. In the film David (Jonny Weston) a handsome social outcast and brilliant science mind finds out that hes been accepted into MIT but with a scholarship that just isnt enough. While digging around in old projects done by his late father (an inventor of sorts) to try to find anything of value he and his little sister stumble across an old video recorder of Davids seventh birthday party where they notice a shadowy figure in the mirror in one of the shots a 17-year-old David. While trying to figure out the mystery of how this could be possible David and his friends uncover blueprints for a time travel machine and immediately get to work building it testing it and eventually using it. In a somewhat amusing wink to the audience the characters keep restating that they have to film everything. The first hour of the film is so relentlessly paced it feels like its on fast-forward. From the camera movements to the manic dialogue and energy of the teens the audience is pummeled with jargon and mostly useless information as the kids try to get a handle on their new toy. There also are a host of just out-of-date references (jokes about films like ""Argo"" and ""Looper"" from 2012) that only serve to remind that this movie previously titled ""Welcome to Yesterday"" has been sitting on the shelf for a year. Even though those remain there were some last-minute edits that took place (between even an early January screening and its Jan. 30 release). Paramount and Michael Bays Platinum Dunes took heat for utilizing footage of an actual plane crash in the movie. They ""are in the process of removing the footage from the film and promotional materials"" the studio said in a statement on the eve of its release declining to specify what will replace it. Thats not to say there arent any good ideas here. When the kids finally figure out how to jump back in time and everything mercifully slows down things get pretty fun for a while as they do exactly what you might expect teenagers would do -- going back in time a few days to ace a failed chemistry test stand up to your bully win some lotto money and so on. Theres also a great sequence that brings the teens to the music festival Lollapalooza that is actually as joyous to watch as it presumably is to be there. Things take a dark turn in the film when David gets greedy and jumps back in time alone to try to re-do a botched moment with his crush (Sofia Black-DElia) and bad things start happening in the future but interest wanes as the stakes get higher. Director Dean Israelite in his feature debut proves that he has a keen knack for conveying teen pluck friendships and flirtations. The scenes that show the actual process of time travel are even quite thrilling and inventive but the found-footage gimmick makes it nearly impossible to evaluate his talents. Its time to hang up the GoPro and return to actual filmmaking. -- Lindsey Bahr The Associated Press  ""Project Almanac"" Grade C- Rated PG-13 Running time 106 minutes Cast and crew Jonny Weston Sofia Black-DElia Sam Lerner Allen Evangelista Virginia Gardner; directed by Dean Israelite. The lowdown Teenage misfits build a time machine and soon discover the ripple effects of their actions in this sci-fi thriller. Director Dean Israelite in his feature debut proves that he has a knack for conveying teen pluck friendships and flirtations but the gimmicky use of found footage and tired pop culture references feel hopelessly dated.

Directed by Dean Israelite in his feature-length debut the big conceit of the script and story is that what were seeing is all footage recorded by the films characters throughout their adventures. Its a stylistic and shooting decision that adds very little and ultimately distracts from the pleasures of the script and performances. See Video Time Travel and Irresponsible Teenagers Dont Mix in New Project Almanac Trailer (Video) Our nerdy hero David Raskin (played with no small amount of wit and winning skill by Jonny Weston) begins the film between a rock and a hard place. Hes been accepted to MIT but cant afford the tuition. While his mom talks about selling the family home David rifles through the papers and gear his long-dead scientist father left in the attic for inspiration. He and his sister Chris (Virginia Gardner ""The Goldbergs"") find an old video camera in their fathers things with 10-year-old footage of Davids 7th birthday party. Looking over the tape memories give way to mystery as 2014 David is briefly but clearly visible in a mirror for a split-second in footage from 2004. Further investigation with the help of Chris fellow tech-head Adam (Allen Evangelista ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"") and the funny flip Quinn (Sam Lerner ""Suburgatory"") leads to a secret set of prototypes and blueprints in the basement hidden by Davids father. ""I cant build a time machine in my basement"" David sputters as the situation dawns on him. Adam re-frames the discussion ""Look at the tape. I think you already did."" Also Read John Krasinski Joining Michael Bays Benghazi Drama 13 Hours ""Project Almanac"" is decidedly and delightfully self-aware like when Quinn breaking into his own house to test a little cause-and-effect hijinks asks ""Have any of you seen Looper?"" Andrew Deutschman and Jason Pagans script is less like the time-travel classics it references by name or resembles in nature (theres a touch of Shane Carruths brilliant ""Primer"" in here with the basement lab and a focus on soldering) and more like the recent ""Final Destination"" films. Much like that horror-thriller franchise ""Project Almanac"" suggests its not smart to mess with the way things should be especially after David starts going back in time again and again first to win the heart of new-to-the-clique cool girl Jessie (Sofia Black-DElia ""Gossip Girl"") and then to correct all the damage his seemingly minor meddling in the name of young romance has wreaked on the fragile fabric of reality. But even with all the teen angst and temporal alterations the film stays fleet funny and fast especially as our leads figure out through trial and error how they can take advantage of their new abilities in ways large and small. Also Read This Is Not a Test Purge 3 In the Works at Universal Blumhouse Even with all of the vertigo-inducing hand-held camerawork and special effects magic that goes into the films time-travel sequences its worth noting that the characters in it all act like real teens. In an extended sequence our fivesome use their god-like power to leap through time -- so they can see Imagine Dragons at Lollapalooza. With VIP passes. Israelites direction is good enough that you have to wonder how much better the film would have been if someone had let him shoot the film from a tripod and not go through all the unnecessary artifice of a constantly-moving camera. But you believe the cast as friends and Weston (""Kelly amp; Cal"" ""Chasing Mavericks"") is a great lead giving a smart and emotionally aware performance that drives all of the films figure-eight looping through the past. In theory ""Project Almanac"" should be a dud -- an all-too-familiar riff on time travel a shooting style that actually obscures the pleasures of the performances and the script and a cast of relatively new faces in a first-time feature directorial debut. But in practice ""Project Almanac"" has enough heart and brains to keep it steady even as the camera isnt and its wires-and-widgets variation on ""The Monkeys Paw"" is very much informed and improved by the charm and capabilities of its young cast making for a fun fast and appropriately grim cautionary tale.

Lets say you discover a time machine in your basement. Would you use it to go back and stop Hitler or would you instead make tiny jumps to tweak the quality of your own life -- like taking your friends to Lollapalooza or perfecting the all-important kiss you flubbed the first time around? For the teens in the found-footage time-travel movie ""Project Almanac"" the chance to rewrite history is wasted trying to perfect their high-school experience which naturally leads to unforeseen consequences -- for them at least although the aftermath will be plenty familiar to butterfly-effect believers -- in a film that squanders its potential. Nearly five years after Paramount announced its Insurge initiative -- a plan to generate 10 pics in the ballpark of 100000 a year conceived in the wake of the 2007 microbudget phenom ""Paranormal Activity"" -- the studio has finally unveiled its first title (not counting 2012s shoestring pickup ""The Devil Inside""). But the gameplan changed somewhere along the way In the end ""Project Almanac"" came in on a low-eight-figure budget despite no stars limited effects and an eye-crossing ""my kid could shoot that"" homevideo aesthetic and the ad costs taken to open it will eat up most of the earnings. Directed by first-timer Dean Israelite but branded more by its association with producer Michael Bay who shepherded under the same shroud of secrecy as with Todd Phillips wildly successful ""Project X"" the end result fails to deliver that renegade one-offs sense of novelty or excitement -- and will likely fall far short of ""Xs"" 102 million haul despite hefty cross-promotion from Par partner MTV. Teen auds already have ""Almanac"" pegged as a time-travel ""Chronicle"" suggesting theyve been there done that and are starting to feel the found-footage burnout. Hip to the trend some creatives have taken to calling this technique ""p.o.v. cinema"" given the first-person selfie-style way audiences are invited to identify with the kids as they document their own adventures. In this case however the approach doesnt feel organic Sure modern teens love to film themselves but these cameras seem to add a layer of distance between the action and the audience. The characters spend too much time worrying about whether theyre capturing the incredible events at hand rather than allowing themselves to experience things directly whereas a more traditional approach almost certainly would have felt more immediate. What ""Almanac"" does bring to the table is a likable cast of convincing social outcasts led by the prom-king-worthy Jonny Weston cast here as nerdy high-school science whiz David Raskin who desperately hopes to get into MIT. Weston is no more a geek than Logan Lerman was a wallflower (in ""Perks"" of same) though the young actor plays awkward endearingly enough that we go along. In fact it would be fair to credit Weston with 90% of the films charm even if his casual relatability later makes it tough to accept the characters turn to the dark side. Together with best friends Adam (Allen Evangelista) and Quinn (Sam Lerner) and documented at every step by kid sis Christina (Ginny Gardner) David has an aptitude for invention but a reckless habit of skipping the safety-test step of the process. While rooting through the attic one day the siblings stumble across an old videocamera with footage from Davids seventh birthday -- footage that upon closer examination appears to include a fuzzy glimpse of present-day David in the background. How could this be possible they wonder while audiences ask another question entirely Why is it taking them so long to figure it out? Eventually the gangs curiosity leads them to a trap door in the familys (astonishingly) untouched basement where Davids dead dad appears to have stashed a so-called temporal displacement device before his disappearance -- a backstory that hints at the possibility of more elaborate twists Jason Harry Pagan and Andrew Deutschmans script has no intention of exploring. Instead the film focuses on the minutiae of getting the gizmo to work trial-and-error attempts involving various power sources accompanied by such impressive touches as levitating tools and electrostatic side effects (Christinas hair stands on end a bulb lights up at Davids touch etc.). No ones more impatient to start time-jumping than David who sets two ground rules before trying the device on himself. First the friends will only jump together and second theyll stay within a three-week window since going any further back risks stranding them in the past for good. Just as theyve about to leap for the first time the sexiest girl in school (Sofia Black-DElia) stops by the basement and catches the guys scheming introducing a wild card into their dynamic. And so the shenanigans begin as this awkward band of social misfits learns the consequences of time travel on the fly the most dangerous being what happens when one of them comes into contact with an earlier version of him- or herself (they start to flicker like a glitchy hologram before canceling each other out altogether). So what would you do if you had the chance to replay the past? First stop Win the lottery. After that these dull teens run out of ideas pretty fast apart from a general desire to make themselves more popular at school -- which comes with all the cautionary fallout one might expect from an American wish-fulfillment fantasy. Instead of building to a big scheme David decides to backtrack before things get too far out of hand and suddenly the movies over and the opportunity missed. Evaluated on the concepts own terms the script clearly could have used another do-over or two before Israelite and his cast took the plunge.

Drake says June 13 2015 at 141 pm This moive has Great potential for a sequel though yes the video capturing could be better. Its the fact on how the movie ended with the clue of the camera ""Second"" being left behind gives a great potential to add project almanac 2. But all in all it was a great movie and I enjoyed it Reply Megan says June 10 2015 at 600 pm a wonderful time travel movie. loved it. what if you could go back in time? that be great Reply Dan Young says January 30 2015 at 751 am One thing separates this film from the other time travel films It is that you can see how this film could play out in real life there was no far fetched technology or unreal ism in this movie. That is what made it a great film Reply GKN says January 28 2015 at 949 am Scares like Paranormal Activity and wish-fulfillment fantasy like this always find a big audience among teens. Plus this seems to have a lot of sequel potential which I am sure is part of the plan. Lousy title though. No one who doesnt see the trailer will guess what its about. Reply therealeverton says January 28 2015 at 157 am Not endorsing their choices butIi should think even the mosy clueless teen is by now aware that you cant go and kill Hitler and trying to do so would likely do more harm than good. Remember that if you end up time traveling people. Reply See All 5 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...
