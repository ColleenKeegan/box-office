Starring Jordan Bridges Marisa Coughlan and Dan Hedaya. Directed by Francois Velle. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""New Suit"" is an appealing Hollywood satire that became a sleeper success in Los Angeles where it ran for several months at the Beverly Center theater. A spin-off of the fairy tale ""The Emperors New Clothes"" the film deals with a nonexistent screenplay that becomes the hottest property in Tinseltown. Jordan Bridges (grandson of Lloyd Bridges) plays Kevin a nice guy who arrives in Los Angeles with dreams of becoming a screenwriter. He meets fellow aspirant Marianne (Marisa Coughlan) one of those lucky and slightly twisted people born with an innate understanding of how the Hollywood game is played. Shes going places. Within a year shes climbing the ladder as a talent agent while hes adrift as a script reader for a midlevel producer. The satire kicks into gear when at a lunch with some fellow readers from other companies Kevin pretends to have read a brilliant new script ""New Suit "" by a writer named Jordan Strawberry. His fellow readers pretend to have read it themselves and from there word spreads throughout the industry. Soon every producer wants to buy the script and rival producers are afraid their competitors will make the deal first. Marianne poses as Strawberrys agent and plans to ride ""New Suit"" to wealth and power. The movie makes fun of a Hollywood in which no one reads and everyone pretends to be connected. Everyone claims to have a close personal relationship with the fictional Strawberry and all the Hollywood players find it entirely reasonable to be bidding over a screenplay they have never seen. As in ""The Emperors New Clothes"" no one will admit that he hasnt seen it. And so the frenzy is fueled by lies on top of lies. Although ""New Suit"" is not in the same league as ""The Big Picture"" or ""The Player"" classics of the Hollywood satire genre its funny and has an interesting edge of bitterness to it. It has both the limits and virtues of an outsiders perspective. Writer Craig Sherman and Francois Velle dont seem to completely know the ins and outs but they do know enough to be disgusted.-- Advisory This film contains sexual situations drug use and strong language.-- Mick LaSalle MONDAYS IN THE SUN Drama. Starring Javier Bardem and Jose Angel Egido. Directed by Fernando Leon de Aranoa. (R. 115 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) If theres a reason to see ""Mondays in the Sun"" (a doubtful premise) the reason is Javier Bardem who goes through the film like a caged lion pacing and circling and dying to break free. Bardem has a fascinating capacity to look like either a caveman or an aesthete and here hes in caveman mode dominating a talented ensemble of actors who play unemployed shipyard workers drinking and talking their lives away in northern Spain. The film is about the degradation of unemployment -- indeed the tragedy of it -- the horror of a mans having to watch his wife go off every morning to work 12 hours in a factory the embarrassment of applying for a loan with no collateral. Its about 50-year-old men dyeing their hair to look younger on job interviews. Its a film of vivid moments and images but the narrative almost of necessity is static. And so alas midway ""Mondays in the Sun"" becomes as dull as a day with nothing to do. Director and co-writer Fernando Leon de Aranoa paints himself into a corner. If he gives in to the need for a story line and concocts some kind of forward motion for these fellows he betrays the point hes trying to make. Yet if he stays true to his vision and honest about his subject absolutely nothing can happen. This is the challenge of making a movie about stasis. Moving pictures and stasis do not make for a felicitous combination. So we take what we can from the experience Bardem lying on his bed staring at the cracked ceiling of a boarding-house room. The sight of this proud physical man handing out leaflets no one will take. The anger that expresses itself in petty rebellion -- a mans refusing to pay for a ferry ride or eating food in a supermarket and not paying for it. About every 10 minutes there are 10 great seconds but the rest is sitting around waiting. At least these poor fellows have an excuse -- theyre bored because their lives are boring. But to plunk down money to actually watch guys be bored -- that would constitute an admission of idleness far beyond anything depicted in the movie.-- Advisory This film contains strong language and sexual references. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...
