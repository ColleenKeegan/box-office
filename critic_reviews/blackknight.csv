"USATODAY.com - Lawrences horseplay shields a so-so Knight Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 11/21/2001 - Updated 0833 AM ET Lawrences horseplay shields a so-so Knight By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Talk about your benighted knights. First there was Heath Ledger as a jousting hunk in the rock-infused A Knights Tale. Now we have Black Knight ( out of four) with Martin Lawrence as Jamal Walker an underachieving amusement-park employee who through an unbelievable set of circumstances becomes Sir Jamal the chivalrous cavalier bent on reinstating a deposed queen. Jamal works at Medieval World a down-on-its-heels community center/theme park in inner-city Los Angeles. He sees a shiny medallion in a litter-strewn ""moat"" that surrounds the park and reaches down to retrieve it falling into the drink and getting hit on the head. He comes to in 14th century England. Initially Jamal has no idea that he has traveled through time and his reactions to medieval life are some of the funniest moments in the film. Back in L.A. a competing amusement park the more upscale Castle World was about to open its doors. So when Jamal happens upon a feudal palace knights in chain mail and cobblestone streets filled with ancient wares he believes that he has wandered into the ultra-realistic Castle World. Hes mistaken for a messenger from a neighboring fiefdom. Castle guards size him up suspiciously and ask where hes from. ""Im from South Central"" he says with a swagger. ""Florence and Normandy."" They instantly usher him in to see the king proclaiming the arrival of the awaited messenger from Normandy. Of course theres the obligatory maiden that Jamal lusts after (Marsha Thomason). It turns out that she has more than romance on her mind. Posing as the kings chambermaid she is plotting to assassinate him and enlists Jamal in her plan. Meanwhile the king (Kevin Conway) is clamoring for news from the Norman prince who has promised to marry his daughter (Jeannette Weegar). But the daughter has some wild oats to sow which Jamal learns firsthand. Shes hot for Jamal especially after he replaces the lutes and lyres at a castle banquet with funky tunes. In one of the films funniest -- and most elaborate -- gags the king orders Jamal to dance. He tries some pathetic pirouettes then coaxes the palace musicians to lose the courtly tunes and conducts them in playing Sly and the Family Stones Dance to the Music. Unfortunately these humorous moments are few. The story grows tedious and predictable and its conclusion is as formulaic as a bad sitcom plot. Lawrence is an occasionally inspired comedian. Bad guy Vincent Regan is a caricature of a villain but then again he has to play an evil knight in this broadest of high-concept comedies so what can we expect? We had hoped for just a funny movie but instead we get some laughs and plenty of yawns. Black Knight might be more aptly named Blah Knight.

Arriving so soon after ""A Knights Tale"" a much funnier commingling of medieval action and anachronistic attitudes and the 25th-anniversary reissue of the classic ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" ""Black Knight"" is a textbook example of too much too late. Martin Lawrence puts the pedal to the metal offering a surfeit of his trademark shtick -- shucking and jiving prancing and pratfalling mugging and bugging out -- with a borderline-desperate zeal that suggests a distressed awareness of reviews and B.O. returns for his last effort the aptly titled ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" Fans who flocked to ""Blue Streak"" and ""Big Mommas House"" might generate decent opening-weekend biz but new pic isnt likely to survive long while jousting against formidable holiday competition. The latest and quite possibly least in a long line of pics loosely based on Mark Twains ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court"" comedy is nothing if not brisk when it comes to establishing high-concept premise. Indeed director Gil Junger (""10 Things I Hate About You"") working from a script Darryl J. Quarles Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow devotes a scant seven minutes to introducing Lawrence as Jamal Walker an underachieving flunky at Medieval World a failing L.A. theme park. After entrepreneurs announce plans to build a more lavish Castle World nearby Jamals boss (Isabell Monk) tries to rally her employees to compete. But Jamal blithely disregards her claim that Medieval World provides valuable jobs for the inner city. In his selfish view she should simply cash out and retire while he seeks employment at the new park. Of course this kind of character invariably receives a redemptive life lesson. For Jamal the learning curve begins when he attempts to retrieve a medallion from the parks fetid moat. Theres a blinding flash of light a sudden shift in the space-time continuum -- and Jamal is zapped back to Merrie Olde England circa 1328. It takes a while however for Jamal to realize he has time-tripped. When he meets and saves the life of Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson) a fallen-from-grace knight he figures the drunken bedraggled fellow is a homeless person. Later when he wanders into the domain of King Leo (Kevin Conway) Jamal mistakes the castle grounds for the spiffier Castle World. He also assumes the king his fellow nobles various courtiers and humble peasants are simply very good actors. They in turn misapprehend Jamal as ""Sir Skywalker"" the Moorish herald of a nobleman engaged to marry the kings randy daughter Princess Regina (Jeannette Weegar). Jamal remains blissfully unaware until he tries to put some smooth moves on Victoria (Marsha Thomason) a Nubian-born handmaiden who makes our hero fully aware of where and when hes landed. While Jamal frantically struggles to make sense of his predicament Victoria tries to enlist the time traveler in a revolutionary plot against the usurping King Leo. ""Black Knight"" is mildly amusing in fits and starts playing the fish-out-of-water setup for easy predictable laughs. During a banquet scene Jamal leads the court musicians in a spirited cover of Sly amp; the Family Stones ""Dance to the Music."" Lawrence tries too hard too relentlessly and the effort shows. It doesnt help at all that the writers didnt provide (or just as likely Lawrence refused to play) a consistent character. At various points in the proceedings Jamal is rendered as a trash-talking homeboy a crafty tactician a soft-touch Mr. Nice Guy a natural-born swordsman and most often the kind of belligerent coward Bob Hope used to play in 40s and 50s comedies. This is a star turn in the worst sense of the term. Displaying appreciably more restraint the supporting players are effortlessly impressive while serving as straight men (and women) for the frenetic comic lead. Theyre not trying to be good sports -- theyre simply trying (successfully) to be good actors. Conway Thomason and Vincent Regan are especially deft at playing for keeps in the midst of the comic high jinks. And Wilkinson even manages to infuse his thinly written character with welcome touches of poignancy dignity and melancholy gravitas. Tech package is slicker and period detail more persuasive than material merits. Ueli Steigers lensing and Leslie Dilleys production design are major pluses. For the record Martin Lawrence is not the first African-American performer to star in a comic adaptation of Twains classic story. Whoopi Goldberg beat him to the punchline with ""A Knight in Camelot"" a 1998 Disney-produced TV movie that unlike ""Black Knight"" openly acknowledged its literary source.

Photo by Nicola Goode TM and  2001 Twentieth Century Fox and Regency Enterprises. Not for ... more Lawrence gets medieval / As a modern man transported to A.D. 1328 he shows remarkable comic vigor 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BLACK KNIGHT Comedy. Starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Gil Junger. (PG- 13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With ""Black Knight"" Martin Lawrence finally gets to show what he can do as a screen comedian. He plays a 21st century man working in a medieval theme park who finds himself suddenly catapulted back to the year 1328. Fortunately he ends up in England so he can speak the language. The bad news is that he arrives just in time to get involved in a rebellion against an evil king. The screenplay (by Darryl J. Quarles and Peter Gaulke and Gerry Swallow) -- with its echoes of Mark Twains ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Court"" - - plays out in a variety of classically comic ways. At first its a farce. Jamal (Lawrence) has no idea that hes not in a theme park in modern-day Los Angeles so when he talks to people he assumes one reality while they make incorrect assumptions about his identity. No one but the audience is privy to the truth. When he meets a wandering drunken knight in the woods he assumes the man is a street person and advises ""Get yourself some food stamps."" When he meets an attractive lady-in-waiting and asks for a pen so he can write down her number hes confused that shes impressed that he can read and write. ""Who you been dating?"" he asks. At one point he mentions that hes from Normandie Street in South Central Los Angeles and the king and the court assume hes a Moor from Normandy. ""Black Knight"" moves deftly and effortlessly from farce into fish-out-out- of-water comedy where the kick comes from watching the comedian react to the strangeness and inconvenience of medieval life. This is where Lawrences comic skill comes in His reactions are so satisfying and extreme that we look forward to what hell do when he sees his first medieval bathroom for instance (a hole in the floor) or attends his first public execution. Lawrence makes look easy what is actually difficult. He expends enormous energy moment after moment and never lets up. He works his face and his body for maximum laughs always staying alert -- and yet doing it all in such a way that its not nerve-racking to watch him. He brings a degree of commitment thats not especially noticeable but the results are unmistakable -- a movie that has comic vigor from beginning to end. Lawrence is funny when hes smirky and confident (for no good reason) and funny when hes panicking (for good reason). The scene in which he has to ride a horse something he has never done is flat-out slapstick and works. Even better is the set piece in which the king forces this Moor from Normandy to dance for the court. Knowing that his dance is bombing Jamal (Lawrence) rescues himself by quickly instructing the court musicians in syncopation teaching them rhythms that would not come into popular use for six more centuries. The resulting number -- to Sylvester Stewarts (that is Sly Stones) ""Dance to the Music"" -- is a delight. ""Black Knight"" has enough story to serve as a conveyor belt for gags and not so much as to get in the way. Lawrence has a strong moment both amusing and truthful when the king orders a man executed for stealing a turnip. Lawrence laughs out loud and keeps laughing until gradually he realizes the king is actually serious. ""Hes killing people for vegetables"" he says incredulously. Lawrence gets adequate support from Tom Wilkinson as Knolte the drunken knight and from Marsha Thomason in the typical and mostly decorative role as the lady-in-waiting. But this is Lawrences show his chance to demonstrate his comic nimbleness and appeal. He runs with it. Advisory This film contains strong language violence and sexual situations.

Lawrence with his trademark jug-eared incredulity plays a sneaky underachiever named Jamal Walker--a minimum-wage joker from Los Angeles who toils away in a medieval theme park. Attempting to retrieve a shiny medallion he falls into a dirty moat and gets transported to a castle in the English countryside in the year 1328. Jamal in his green football jersey is the sort of guy who wishes that life could be a quivering-booty hip-hop video; hes a bling-bling wannabe trapped in Dark Ages squalor. Early on there are some good gags as our hero endures close encounters with a hole-in-the-floor castle toilet a forest bum who roasts what looks like rodent-on-a-stick and finally a real live beheading that awakens Jamal to the prospect that no hes not in South Central anymore. Then comes a showpiece scene that should by all rights have been one of the movies highlights. Jamal posing as a messenger from Normandy is ordered by the king to perform a solo dance for the court. Lawrence offers up a few desperate prancing moves but just as the scene is building (can you imagine the madness Jim Carrey might have made of it?) he heads over to the dolcian-and-lute ensemble and offers the players a few hasty tips. Soon theyre laying down the funk groove of Sly amp; the Family Stones ""Dance to the Music"" and the entire court is boogying in the aisles. Big laugh But is it? In Black Knight Martin Lawrence defeats--and converts --the medieval world before it even has a chance to inspire a fresh comic reaction out of him. The culture of the Middle Ages is set up as a geohistorical straight man yet every gag winds itself so completely around Lawrences idiom and personality that the universe of swords damsels and dung just turns into a foldout backdrop for his latest wallow in attitude. Monty Python and the Holy Martin in other words this aint. That said there are moments when Black Knight does recall the amusing incongruities of Terry Gilliams first solo directorial venture the 1977 medieval grungefest Jabberwocky. Jamal introduces a 14th-century fighter to the rope-a-dope and hes paired with a royal concubine (Marsha Thomason) whom he tries to convert to the way of thongs and mai tais. Lawrence as always exerts the appeal of a con man too lightweight to buy into his own con. Hed be funnier though if he didnt insist on being the only funny thing in the room.
