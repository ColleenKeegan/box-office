By Anthony Lane Two new films portray good guys and bad guys--all of whom have guns.   Credit Illustration by Daniel Hertzberg How much thought went into the name of the new Ruben Fleischer film? Suffice it to say that this story about a squad of policemen formed to wage war on gangsters is called ""Gangster Squad."" Quite right too. Once you get into the rough immortal poetry of titles like ""GoodFellas"" and ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" people only get confused. The movie is set in 1949 when pretty much everything in Los Angeles--drugs brothels casinos cops and politicians--lies in thrall to Mickey Cohen (Sean Penn) a Brooklyn-born despot who still doesnt know which fork to use for his entree. The only man uncowed enough to oppose him is Police Chief William Parker--played by what I took to be a large expanse of solid oak panelling though on closer inspection it turned out to be Nick Nolte. Parker asks Sergeant John OMara (Josh Brolin) to rustle up a few colleagues in secret and bring Cohen down at any cost. So he does. The most fun you can have with ""Gangster Squad"" which was written by Will Beall is to lay bets before you see it on the range of archetypes within the squad. I like to think that I would have predicted the gruff old-school gunslinger (Robert Patrick) though the presence of an eager Hispanic rookie (Michael Pena) as a sidekick was too blatant even for my calculations. Then there is the young black officer (Anthony Mackie) switchblade-quick whom we first meet needless to say at a Burbank joint that is nothing if not jumpin. Add the shy communications expert (Giovanni Ribisi) with the adoring blond son--guess where that is heading--and were almost done. All thats required to complete the set is the lazy Lothario (Ryan Gosling) who needs a jolt of conscience before he can join the team. Gosling who did such demanding work in ""Blue Valentine"" and ""Drive"" must have laughed when he got the ""Gangster Squad"" script and realized that his principal duty as Sergeant Jerry Wooters would be to deliver The Look. You know the one imagine that your local animal shelter sends out a fund-raising leaflet and Gosling is the beagle on the cover. It never fails. The dame who falls for it on this occasion is Grace Faraday (Emma Stone) Mickeys current squeeze. Of all the redheads in all the night clubs in all of L.A. Wooters has to bump into her. In fact their first scene marks one of the rare moments in which ""Gangster Squad"" swells into life. Its never going to match Burt Lancasters initial glimpse of Ava Gardner in ""The Killers"" when the whole world seemed to judder to a halt yet theres something in Stones lips as dark as spilt blood and in the sheathing silk of her dress that takes even Gosling aback and hints at a richness of feeling that the rest of the movie struggles in vain to catch. So much of the telling feels shamelessly secondhand. Is there a single viewer in 2013 who still believes that a cop like Wooters would get his information from a friendly shoeshine boy outside the villains club? This was parodied and pulverized by ""Police Squad"" the great Leslie Nielsen TV show of the nineteen-eighties in which Johnny the shoeshiner would for a quiet buck dispense professional advice not just to the heroic detective but also to priests ballplayers and surgeons (""Be careful not to puncture the myocardium""). Theres no way back from that. The over-all result is a misstep for Fleischer who proved in the gleeful ""Zombieland"" (2009) that it was possible both to mock and revive a genre on the edge of depletion. Bill Murray had a celebrated cameo in that film as himself in which he feigned zombiehood and almost got away with it. Would that Sean Penn in the new film had risked such knowingness. What happens instead is that his monstrous unsmiling performance expands to fill the vacancy of the story abetted by the bragging of his dialogue--""Im the future"" ""Im progress"" ""Youre talking to God."" So hard does he try with his fury-twisted features that I half expected to learn that the real Mickey Cohen had stayed back in New York and that this guy was an actor hired to do an impersonation of a leading Jewish hoodlum. Because we dont believe in him we never really fear him; and because we dont fear him we dont set that much store by the noble campaign to erase him which is meant to be the point of the movie. OMara and his mates are doing a tough job for sure but its just a job. At one point OMara sits on his porch and wonders whether the means they have employed in their mission make them no better than Cohen and his thugs. This is hardly an unusual issue in the cinema of crime but it is never an unimportant one. We feel it keenly in the Russell Crowe character in ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997) and long before that in Bannion the brutalized hero of Fritz Langs ""The Big Heat"" (1953). When Bannions wife was targeted by the Mob it was a turning point in his own descent toward a wild vengeance. When the same thing occurs in ""Gangster Squad"" to OMaras pregnant wife (Mireille Enos) the sequence is granted a ludicrous happy ending but thats not the problem. The problem is that OMara has been feral in his methods from the start happily slicing someones hand off in the door of a plunging elevator and that the film has loved him for it. It seems to me highly compromising to have your characters worry about the effects of violence on their own souls while simultaneously ushering your cameraman to the finest ringside seat and instructing him not to look away as those violent deeds unfold. The movie has barely started for example before one of Cohens victims is chained to a couple of cars and torn in half. We are given an overhead view of the bisection. Why? To threaten us to gross us out to show off? If Mickey Cohen himself were directing the film he couldnt have done better. Several things suggest that ""Gangster Squad"" and Christopher McQuarries ""Jack Reacher"" should be cuffed together. Both deal in a shadowy dispensing of justice first by OMara and then by Reacher (Tom Cruise) a former military investigator who is brought in--or brings himself in--to solve a multiple murder. Also toward the end of both films a couple of strapping fellows cast aside their weaponry and resort to good old fisticuffs the rustiest of narrative devices further blunted by the remorseless fetishizing of guns often in oily closeup that has prevailed throughout. Which brings us to the third affinity The fates of both movies were changed by events in the wider nonvirtual world. A scene in ""Gangster Squad"" featuring a shootout in a cinema was cut and replaced after the killings in Aurora Colorado on July 20th of last year. And the premiere of ""Jack Reacher"" in Pittsburgh on December 15th was postponed after the shootings in Newtown Connecticut the previous day; the film begins with citizens being gunned down by a sniper with a high-powered rifle. These reactions were respectful and responsible. To claim that all due respect has now been paid however or that all ethical responsibilities have been fulfilled would be disingenuous. The issue of screen violence carries far less weight in such fathomless horrors than that of gun control; the connection between what a disturbed and resentful young man used to watch or play on his computer and what he then wreaks in public with an assault weapon wouldnt matter if he couldnt lay his hands on such a weapon in the first place. Yet the connection however oblique exists. You can argue that evil will always seek a blueprint and find a way but we are still obliged I think to pass beyond the pathology of the madman and pose a vaster and no less vexing question. What does it mean for the majority of us the nonviolent millions that year after year we should observe such a rising flood of savage fictional acts that after a while we scarcely notice or mind? And is there anything that a filmmaker could or should do to stem the flow? This is a lot to lay on ""Jack Reacher"" a trim thriller with an enviable lack of grandeur. It sports a fine car chase some screeching ninety-degree turns in the plot and for Tom Cruise fanatics an ominous shortage of grins. Is a star as solid as he is really the right choice to play a ghostly drifter of no fixed abode? But McQuarrie has an ace in the shape of his supporting cast not just Rosamund Pike Richard Jenkins and Robert Duvall but a dead-eyed Werner Herzog no less in the role--at once camp and genuinely frightening--of an icy mastermind. Beyond these notables though come lesser names cleverly cast by McQuarrie as links in the chain of consequences that violence drags behind it Alexia Fast who as a young woman caught up in conspiracy has a heartbreaking perkiness about her plus the wisdom to know that nothing will end well; and James Martin Kelly who gets one majestic scene as a victims father. In his red exhausted gaze there is an unanswerable rebuke not only to the thrills that pepper the rest of the movie but to our cheerful reflex assumption that we can somehow have thrills without spills. There will be blood his eyes tell us but that is not a promise its a lament.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

In Childss novels (which are both addictive and disgustingly brutal) Reachers personality is inseparable from his size. He strives to be rootless to disappear into the landscape but his hugeness makes it impossible. Its a hugeness of spirit too. The guy cant watch an injustice without jumping in and breaking the bad guys bones. Hes an injustice magnet of course -- city after city best seller after best seller. Cruise enters Jack Reacher on his tippy-toes preening his chest swollen. Women in the movie do double takes around this gorgeous hunk of man. But the more he puffs himself up the punier he seems. His wide-eyed smirk evokes Mark Harmon a scaled-for-TV actor. Cruise underplayed beautifully in the last Mission Impossible picture but Jack Reacher looks like a vanity license plate on a car that only an asshole would drive. The fair Rosamund Pike overacts as the D.A.s daughter whos determined to defend an all but certainly guilty Iraq War vet accused of shooting random people in a park. But you cant blame her for trying to get a rhythm going. Director Christopher McQuarrie lays on the Chandleresque banter but Cruise should never ever play a man who has to look like hes thinking. Those wheels just dont turn. Alexia Fast is funny and then poignant as a working-class patsy and every scene with Werner Herzog as the disfigured Siberia-cold criminal mastermind ""the Zec"" is a howl. But the context makes it difficult to laugh even bad-naturedly. Its not the filmmakers fault that the opening sequence is especially horrible after the Newtown massacre but the whole movie is like an NRA wet dream with Robert Duvall as a crusty gun-range owner who pitches in to shoot bad guys. Jack Reacher already feels as if it belongs to another era.

"Jack Reacher | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jack-reacher ) Jack Reacher (United States 2012) December 22 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Jack Reacher has the distinction of being little more than it initially appears to be a clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie that offers little more than every other clumsily condensed mystery/thriller novel made into a movie. Overlong and undercooked the film fails to gain traction on any level. Its dramatically inert and relies on uninspired action sequences to provide ""pop."" Christopher McQuarrie who wrote The Usual Suspects and Valkyrie adapts Lee Childs One Shot into an uneven screenplay that is talky and exposition-heavy in the first half before offering a modicum of satisfaction toward the end. Yes even in a pedestrian movie it can be fun to see the bad guys get their comeuppance. Watching Jack Reacher I was reminded of Alex Cross which suffered from many of the same problems. Things that work in books often dont translate well into movies especially given the time constraints. At 130 minutes Jack Reacher is too long but it feels rushed and incomplete. Its obvious that subplots were truncated or cut and character arcs were abridged. Werner Herzogs villain The Zec is a fascinating piece of work but he has minimal screen time. By releasing Jack Reacher in December Paramount Pictures wants to draw a connection to Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol the box office success released at this time a year ago. December is actually a good time to release an action thriller since it makes a change from all of the serious would-be Oscar contenders clogging up multiplex screens. What made Mission Impossible successful was its audacity and spectacle. Neither of these elements is much in evident in Jack Reacher despite misleading trailers that attempt to portray this as more of a kick-ass experience than it is. Cruise in a role thats not a great fit is the title character an ex-military investigator who has returned to the United States as a ""ghost"" who leaves no electronic trail. When a sniper takes out five innocent people Jacks history with the man gets him pulled into the investigation; he soon becomes the lead investigator for the defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike). Despite an inner desire to see the man die from lethal injection Jack begins to uncover a disconcerting series of clues that lead him to conclude that Helens client is innocent. The killer is not only still at large but willing to strike again to cover his tracks. Cruise isnt the only one whos miscast although considering that hes the producer his participation is understandable. Rosamund Pike is unconvincing as the smart idealistic Helen. She does a lot of eyelash-batting and smiling that are antithetical to what one expects from the female ""sidekick"" in a movie like this. Richard Jenkins (as Helens father the D.A.) and David Oyelowo (as the lead police investigator) are solid actors in search of a paycheck. The only one who really seems invested in his role is respected German director Werner Herzog in one of his occasional forays in front of the cameras. His portrayal of ""The Zec"" is genuinely creepy. Robert Duvall shows up late in the proceedings for reasons only he can explain. Tonal inconsistencies abound. There are times when Jack Reacher appears headed into romantic territory only to pull back and decide to make Helen and Jacks relationship professional. Theres also a bizarre bathroom fight scene that verges on slapstick. The bad guys in this sequence are such utter buffoons that it creates a disconnect with a movie that is otherwise pretty grim. Jack Reachers timing is also unfortunate with respect to some of the content the movie opens with an image of a sniper putting a six-year old girl in the crosshairs of his scope. And while the child isnt slain five other people are - all-in-all not a great way to create an environment of ""escapism"" given current events. (In McQuarries defense primary shooting on Jack Reacher was complete long before even the Aurora incident.) Jack Reachers centerpiece action sequences which include a lengthy car chase and a shootout/fight are shot in a clear coherent manner but lack the content to make them noteworthy. They are generic staples and because no sense of excitement or suspense accompanies them they feel overlong and at times almost tedious. Jack Reacher is B-level material that has been given an A-level treatment. Despite all the talent involved both in front of and behind the camera this would-be franchise launcher never achieves anything better than a decaying low orbit. I wouldnt bet the mortgage on there being a Jack Reacher 2.

How could they get it sooo wrong charlessaid on Sunday November 17 2013 95200 AMThis movie takes all the bad bits of all the worst action hero movies ever and rolles it into this piece of garbage. Movie making is turning into a fast food industry. Dick Longsaid on Thursday April 18 2013 93733 AMThis review was dead on accurate. Cruises performance was hilariously bad for the exact reasons Roeper mentioned. Cruise acts like a huge strapping 6 foot 6 brawler would act. In his mind Cruise is 6-6 but on screen its funny to watch the tough guy act. And then there is the brain dead plot. Cruise figures out the clues without them being revealed like a bad 70s TV show. The fact that some of you thought it was good is why Hollywood is laughing at the public knowing it can put out no effort macho garbage and half the idiotic population will eat it up. Roeper was dead on accurate unfortunately. Eddy Richsaid on Saturday April 13 2013 100048 PMI just saw this movie at the two dollar theater in Duluth Georgia. Seeing it was a happenstance because the movie we actually went to see was no longer playing and someone suggested we see Jack Reacher. I was not impressed with the trailer I saw at a screening of Lincoln last year. Dont usually go for TC movies. Havent read the book. But my wife and I both thought the movie was great. I cant believe some of the reviews I am seeing here online. I would nominate Tom Cruise for an Academy award-winning performance. I love the role played by Robert Duvall. Like Cruise he nailed his role. Duvall could play a dogcatcher and make it entertaining and believable. The top criminal was Brilliantly played by the director/actor whose name escapes me just now. He nailed his role as well a ruthless bloodthirsty Russian Mafia kingpin With ice in his veins. The Female defense attorney was great believable as a lawyer with limited experience and not callous enough to disregard Reachers evidence. The Chase scene and Chevelle reminded me a lot of Steve McQueen in Bullitt. A few twists and turns in this great plot and a lot of excitement. The Richs give This one five stars And aint it about time the bad guys finally got whats coming to them? Hats off to the guys in white. I cant wait for ""Jack Reacher Avenging Benghazi What Really Happened"" Not too many movies inspire me to read the book. This John Wayne Dirty Harry Josie Wales does Nicksaid on Monday March 04 2013 60618 AMIt would be great if we as a society were past judging people (and their performances) on physical characteristics. The fact that were not makes me want to give up christianity and become an evolutionist (joking of course). Some people and their judgemental attitudes need to ""evolve"". Jeff Jsaid on Monday January 28 2013 93203 AMI sometimes wonder if critics actually WATCH the movies they are supposed to be reviewing. TC doesnt give his trademark smile even ONCE in the film. Hes sullen sarcastic and gets genuinely pissed off in the film. The way a REAL pearson would. And news flash Jack Reacher is NOT a hero Hes pressed into service against his will by an idealist and his own need for closure with an old foe. I would have put the film in the B+ to A- range. TC not being the hulking figure the book describes just makes him MORE believable. Not less Judy Cameronsaid on Monday January 21 2013 115604 PMAs a rabid Jack Reacher fan I was very disappointed in the film the whole power of Jack Reacher is his 6ft 6 frame and TC is what? 5ft nothing? the dialogue was stilted and seemed forced. As someone who is totally in love with Jack Reacher I felt let down. Think again about who you sell your next novel to Mr. Childs  BKsaid on Sunday January 20 2013 23219 PMit grinds my gears that people get all antsy when a FILM CRITIC reads into movies ""way too much"". News flash thats his damn job. And I for one agree with Richard in his review and it seems like most critics thought the same about the move. Jimsaid on Thursday January 10 2013 94633 PMHave to disagree with you Mr. Roeper. This movie more in the B+ / A- range. I enjoyed it as a throwback good guy vs bad guy movie like Dirty Harry or Billy Jack. The cockiness and mugging you saw in Cruises performance I interpreted as confidence. Im a new reader to the Lee Childs books but the physical differences didnt bother me. I felt Cruise and the director captured the essence of Jack Reachers skill intelligence attitude and moral code perfectly. Just because the Dark Knight Batman movies were fantastic doesnt mean a hero has to be dark and complicated. With the Jack Reacher character you get what you see. Half the time he tells you exactly what he is going to do. Nothing complicated about an unstoppable force of muscle ability and will. In an action movie sometimes its better that way. sebastiansaid on Saturday January 05 2013 115716 PMthere was nothing wrong with cruises performance.

Georges and Anne are in their eighties. One day Anne has an attack and the couples bond of love is severely tested. (Photo/Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 20 2012 716 p.m. ET Most films these days mimic the furious pace of our lives; they hurtle along from start to finish seldom pausing to breathe. Michael Hanekes French-language ""Amour"" a perfect film about intertwined lives proceeds at its own pace and breathes so deeply that it takes your own breath away. The setting is a comfortable Parisian apartment probably stylish in its day but showing its age where Georges and Anne a husband and wife played by Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva share a life of quiet pleasures and comforting routines. Theyre retired music teachers in their 80s and the apartment is their untroubled world until one morning at breakfast Anne disappears. Shes there physically but what proves to be a transient stroke removes her and then a few moments later returns her seemingly intact. ""Amour"" is about the love that binds these two wonderful people and about sustaining that love in the shadow of death. Mr. Hanekes film exquisitely photographed by Darius Khondji has won all sorts of prizes all over the world and no wonder; the performances alone set it off as a welcoming masterpiece. ( Isabelle Huppert is fine as the couples high-strung daughter.) Since Annes condition worsens at first slowly and then anguishingly the more dramatic of the two roles is Ms. Rivas. This extraordinary artist who made her feature debut 53 years ago in another movie with love in the title ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"" is as unsparing as her director in depicting Annes decline though physical insults and the erosion of identity are only part of the story. Moments of happiness still occur. Revisiting her past through a photo album Anne smiles an ineffably poignant smile and says ""Its beautiful life."" Mr. Trintignant a popular star of French films in the 1960s and 70s achieves in his role a ruefully calm transcendence. Georges may be a bit forgetful and somewhat rickety on his feet but hes in full possession of his senses from start to finish which is both a blessing and an undeserved curse. He cant really cope with the physical demands of caring for his wife though he does his very good best before hes tested beyond endurance. And he cant slow the course of her decline so he slows the passage of what time remains to them with stories--luminous stories of his life and theirs stories with an undercurrent of heartbreak and horror. To watch Mr. Trintignant in these moments and to hear the subtle modulations of his spoken words into a kind of dulcet music is to witness great acting stripped to the emotional bone. Georges is not just a paragon of love and devotion but of tenacity pride shocking anger and possessiveness often all at the same instant; Anne is his to care for and no one elses in the apartment that threatens to become a tomb. ""Amour"" might seem hardly the stuff of entertainment yet the reason it has been acclaimed isnt mysterious. Confronting death it studies life closely and lovingly. One of the stories that Georges tells Anne is about his childhood but its also not incidentally about movies--about his seeing a movie as a child and then shortly afterward not being able to recall the story only the feelings it evoked. From the beginning of our lives to the end this movie says feelings are all that matter. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Watch a clip from the film ""Jack Reacher"" starring Tom Cruise Richard Jenkins David Oyelowo and Rosamund Pike. A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a military sniper who shot five random victims. (Photo/Video Paramount) Jack Reacher Would ""Jack Reacher"" have been as loathsome if it had been released before the shootings at Sandy Hook elementary school? Surely not. A couple of weeks ago it might have been seen as just another dumb thriller in which a shooter with an assault rifle kills helpless victims in a public space. This week its a corporate disgrace. Paramount Pictures delayed some of the movies preopening parties and premieres out of deference to Sandy Hook but the studio must have felt there was too much money riding on its massive marketing campaign to postpone the actual opening. ENLARGE Tom Cruise Paramount Pictures; Still greed and insensitivity dont tell the full tale. ""Jack Reacher"" which Christopher McQuarrie directed from his adaptation of a Lee Child crime novel is not just another dumb thriller. Its almost peerlessly self-important weirdly incoherent and eerily smarmy. Its also mysteriously inept considering that Tom Cruise plays the title role a mythical veteran of Iraq who goes from city to city righting wrongs. What is Mr. Cruise doing here? What is he doing to his increasingly erratic career? He was perfectly fine in last years elaborate installment of ""Mission Impossible"" to which Mr. McQuarrie reportedly contributed rewrites because the movie had the bright idea of providing fun. The actor is no fun at all in his Jack Reacher incarnation which amounts--not just for him--to an exercise in filmed taxidermy. Not even the radiantly gifted Rosamund Pike survives the productions crippled dialogue stylistic gropes in the direction of film noir and feeble attempts at absurdist comedy not to mention though I will a succession of ludicrously leering close-ups. Almost two decades ago Mr. McQuarrie wrote a classic mindbender ""The Usual Suspects."" But hes over his head as a director and though his script strives to bend minds it numbs brains since most of its connective tissue seems to have been devoured by a screenwriting analog of necrotizing fasciitis. Its hard to say therefore exactly what the story is about but theres the shooter shooting real-estate machinations by Georgian gangsters replays of the shooter shooting Werner Herzog chewing the scenery as some sort of gulag survivor who has chewed his own fingers off a district-attorney daddys conflict with his public-defender daughter and in case the central point has been lost more shots of the shooter shooting. Before the screening friends expressed mild pleasure that the studio was providing free popcorn and soda. No no I told them you dont understand. Free popcorn and soda at a screening is a red flag; it almost always means the studio knows the movie is a turkey. How little I knew of what the studio must know. This movie is a turkey gone rancid. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""The Impossible"" an account of a family (Ewan McGregor Naomi Watts and Tom Holland) caught in the mayhem of the 2004 Tsnumai in Southeast Asia. (Photo/Video Summit Entertainment) The Impossible Ever since ""Jaws"" shots of an ominously serene sea mean ""shark."" In ""The Impossible"" they mean ""sea"" a titanic rearing-up of the Indian Ocean into the tsunami of 2004. This film achieves its own kind of impossible by creating on a substantial budget but not a huge one an astonishingly realistic re-creation of that cataclysm. Digital artistry explains part of it but I cant imagine how the director J.A. Bayona and his colleagues staged the chaotic aftermath in which vast new saltwater rivers sweep away everything and everyone in their path. ENLARGE Naomi Watts and Tom Holland Summit Entertainment Yet its not just the visuals that make the movie what it is a thrilling if also punishing tale of heroic endurance. ""The Impossible"" based on a true story derives most of its impressive power from two remarkable performances Naomi Watts as Maria a mother and physician torn from her husband (Ewan McGregor) and three sons when the tsunami hits their beach resort in Thailand and Tom Holland as Lucas the oldest of the sons whos reconnected with his mother by the floods. Lucas barely into adolescence comes of age in a matter of a few disaster-filled days. Maria is twice transformed first into a wild woman protecting one of her cubs then into a victim of massive injuries. Never has a beautiful movie star looked or acted more convincingly brutalized by random fate. --J.M. On the Road This road trip a screen adaptation of Jack Kerouacs classic anthem of the Beat Generation was directed by Walter Salles from a screenplay by Jose Rivera. Its neither the first nor the best road trip that Mr. Salles has brought to the screen. ENLARGE Sam Riley IFC Films Eight years ago he did ""The Motorcycle Diaries"" a buoyant buddy-bonding account of the young Che Guevara on a voyage of discovery through Latin America. ""On the Road"" is buoyed though only so far by Eric Gautiers cinematography and Carlos Contis production design--New York and San Francisco in the late 1940s young spirits seeking bohemian release as they hurtle across a still-rustic country in a broad-beamed maroon Hudson. Yet the narrative lacks a strong heartbeat; you keep wondering why the spectacle isnt as affecting as it is picturesque. Part of the problem lies in the nature of the production--better to read a book that a writer has written especially a book as volcanic as Kerouacs than to watch the writer writing it on the screen. Mainly though buoyancy fails because the acting is flat notwithstanding the heros declaration that hes attracted by people who ""burn burn like Roman candles across the night."" The cast includes Sam Riley as Sal Paradise Kerouacs surrogate; Garrett Hedlund as the prime Roman candle Dean Moriarty/Neal Cassady; Kristen Stewart as Marylou/LuAnne Henderson; Amy Adams as Jane/Joan Vollmer and Tom Sturridge as Carlo Marx Kerouacs stand-in for Allen Ginsberg. Its not a good sign that the movies most stirring moment comes when Sal opens an envelope that Marx has sent him and the camera studies the words of Ginsbergs legendary ""Denver Doldrums"" handwritten on a piece of paper. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""The Guilt Trip."" As inventor Andy Brewster (Seth Rogen) is about to embark on a road trip a visit with his mom (Barbara Streisand) turns into a cross-country voyage with her along for the ride. (Photo/Video Paramount) The Guilt Trip ""The Guilt Trip"" can be seen as what happened when Miss Marmelstein the wistful secretary played so sensationally by Barbra Streisand in the Broadway musical that put her on the map grew up to be the devouring Jewish mother of a nebbishy devouree played by Seth Rogen. The pretext of the movie which was directed in broadbrush-cartoon style by Anne Fletcher from a coarse-textured script by Dan Fogelman is a road trip taken by mother Joyce and son Andrew. He brings her along just like that because hes hatched a cockeyed scheme to reconnect her with an old flame and get her off his back. Andrew who has invented an organic cleaning compound pitches it to retailers in a succession of meetings across the country that have no grounding in any known reality. That describes long stretches of this short film which stops dead in its tracks for a bizarre set piece in which Joyce must scarf a 50-ounce steak for the sake of a free meal. Yet theres also a moment when she reminisces about that lost love and Ms. Streisand grounded in a reality thats both simple and affecting shows us how a cartoon can come however briefly to vivid life. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) Emmanuelle Riva is superb as a French movie actress in this enigmatic incantatory debut feature by Alain Resnais. In the opening shot her nude body is intertwined with Eiji Okadas He plays a Japanese architect. Pauline Kael wasnt impressed by the movies high seriousness. ""Hushed and hypnotic"" she wrote ""it makes you so conscious of its artistry that you may feel as if in a church and need to giggle."" Most critics and moviegoers though took it very seriously as an allegorical statement against atomic bombs. The script was the work of the French writer and then director Marguerite Duras. ENLARGE The Conformist Everett Collection The Conformist (1970) Jean-Louis Trintignant plays the title role in Bernardo Bertoluccis sumptuous masterpiece set in 1930s Italy and based on a novel by Alberto Moravia. Mr. Trintignant is Marcello a man of more ambition than talent who flees what he loathes about himself by becoming a fascist assassin. The film functions as a political parable; as a psychosexual study in compensatory behavior (its not just about the emotional roots of fascism but about why sinning preachers denounce sin or deviant legislators seek to police the sort of crimes they commit) and as a supremely stylish work of cinematic art. ENLARGE All Night Long (1981) Barbra Streisand is Cheryl Gibbons a soft-spoken but savvy bleached blonde in Jean-Claude Tramonts enjoyable though at this point little known slapstick romance. Gene Hackman is George Dupler a family man in Los Angeles who drops out to enjoy life on his own terms after hes denied a promotion and demoted to night manager at an all-night drugstore. The original script was written by W.D. Richter. The cast includes Dennis Quaid as Georges son Diane Ladd as Georges wife and Kevin Dobson as Cheryls husband. --J.M.

Karen Ballard/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video Jack Reacher (Trailer) Monitor Movie Guide The Lee Child pulp thriller ""One Shot"" is the occasion for a possible franchise in ""Jack Reacher"" starring Tom Cruise as the eponymous tough guy who drifts into crime scenes out of nowhere and clears up the mess. In Childs Reacher books the character is a burly hulk but Cruise is perfectly fine. Who says all tough guys have to look like the Terminator?Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (he wrote ""The Usual Suspects"") has a good feel for hard-boiled theatrics and the plot - which has to do with a sniper shooting and the clearing of an innocent man - is well-engineered. Werner Herzog better known as one of the finest living directors plays a bad guy with Teutonic relish. If he doesnt watch it hell have a whole other career for himself playing dead-eyed villains.

Comments click to enlarge Jack Reacher Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2012 Tom Cruise is the title character a reclusive former military officer who comes out of hiding to help investigate a mysterious mass shooting. Adapted from a series of paperback thrillers by UK writer Lee Childs this never transcends its mass-market origins; writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (The Way of the Gun) fails to provide any interesting subtext to the generic plotting and his attempts at Chandler-esque dialogue tend to fall flat. Still this is brisk attention-grabbing and generally unpretentious--basically an old noir programmer inflated to blockbuster proportions. The impressive cast includes Robert Duvall Richard Jenkins David Oyelowo and in a fun bit of stunt casting Werner Herzog as one of the villains.

In fact the whole thing - Tom Cruise IS Jack Reacher - sounded a little like one of the porn films from ""Boogie Nights."" Was Amber Waves directing? Even if you are a fan of the Reacher mysteries the film may leave you a little confused too. Reacher - an ex-military cop who lives off the grid and wanders around enforcing rough justice - is supposed to be a strapping 65 blond. And Cruise - well isnt. But no one can match Cruise for calm cool cockiness. And Reacher is made of it. I dont know what else hes made up of but in the film its equal parts macho and malarkey. Hes the kind of guy who takes on five thugs - and sends them to the hospital. Who gets the drop on a villain - and then throws his own weapon away just so he can go hand-to-hand. This is sort of silly even by the hyped-up traditions of the Bond series (and Cruises own ""Mission Impossible"" franchise). Ive got a gun on you innocent lives hang in the balance - and Im going to disarm myself just so I can have the pleasure of beating you up? Frankly Jack Reacher is a little ridiculous. But so is ""Jack Reacher"" his new big-screen adventure and Cruise Inc. obviously hopes the beginning of another star-driven franchise. The story - taken from the book ""One Shot"" which falls about in the middle of the 17-and-counting series - has an ex-Army sniper picked up in Pittsburgh and charged with a perfectly random shooting that took down five innocent people. But was it random? And - more to the point - did he do it? Reacher who has a not pleasant history with the man still has his doubts. And so he teams up with the fellows dishy defense counsel to drive around Iron City engage in a lot of trespass and intimidation and do what he can to make sure the guilty are punished. Lethally. Cruise is ripped and ready and theres a tense car chase. (The direction is by Princetons Christopher McQuarrie who wrote the artful ""The Usual Suspects"" and wrote and directed the awful ""The Way of the Gun."") The casting takes a few nice turns too particularly in bringing in arthouse auteur Werner Herzog as a mysterious villain. But Herzogs character - a nameless survivor of the Soviet gulag - would be absurd even by 007 standards. And other characters - including poor Rosamund Pike as that cleavage-baring defense lawyer whose father just happens to be the hard-nosed district attorney prosecuting the case - are corny at best. Its star of course remains ridiculously focused throughout doing what he does best step by step. (Be the most absurdly confident guy on screen? Check. Briefly display agelessly trim bod? Check. Run really hard fists pumping? Check.) Its just another reliable audience-tested entertainment product from the Tom Cruise Fun Factory - and guaranteed to please the least demanding of his fervent fans. But like most toys these days its also made to be played with and then forgotten. And it only ends up reminding us of how much better Cruises riskier more personal work - particularly his outside-the-box performances in pictures like ""Tropic Thunder"" ""Magnolia"" and ""Rock of Ages"" - truly is.

Based on a book in Lee Childs crime series. Claudia Puig USA TODAY 431 p.m. EST December 21 2012Tom Cruise returns to action as the mysterious do-gooder.Despite a terrific cast Jack Reacher starring Tom Cruise in the title role offers a mediocre and cliched thriller.(Photo Karen Ballard Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike Richard Jenkins David Oyelowo Werner HerzogRated PG-13; running time 2 hours 10 minutes; opens Friday nationwideNot reaching too far beyond the obvious Jack Reacher the mysterious stranger travels on well-trod turf.A crime thriller based on Lee Childs novel One Shot the eponymous Jack Reacher ( out of four; rated PG-13; opening Friday nationwide) stars Tom Cruise as an enigmatic loner a former military police officer and brave latter-day knight errant who heeds his own moral code above all laws. In other words hes a flesh-and-blood superhero.Jack is called in by former military sniper James Barr (Joseph Sikora) who is accused of murdering five people at random. Following his arrest the alleged killer scribbled a cryptic note ""Get Jack Reacher.""FREYDKIN  Tom Cruise remains a man on a missionVIDEO Tom Cruise attends London premiere ReacherHelen Rodin (Rosamund Pike) the public defender representing Barr tracks down the elusive Jack and realizes he can prove useful. Super-observant Reacher catches details that others dont -- such as the fact that the killer fired six shots. Helen hires Jack as an investigator and he begins breaking down the minutiae of the murders.The police especially lead detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) are convinced the killings are a slam-dunk case. Reacher knew the accused in the military and remembers him as a first-rate sniper. So his first question is why one of the shots missed a target.Jack questions the honesty of Helens district attorney father Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and teams up with Cash (Robert Duvall) an ex-soldier who runs a shooting range. The tricky relationship between Helen and her father is one of the more intriguing parts of the film. Is he crooked? Does he have her best interests at heart or is he power-mad? Can she trust him?The top-flight ensemble cast which includes filmmaker Werner Herzog as a shadowy Russian mobster is generally saddled with bland one-dimensional parts. Pike brings intelligence and warmth to a rather lackluster role. Cruise is competent as the hard-hearted righter of wrongs convincing as a guy whos fairly impervious to danger. Reacher is not all that different from the guy he plays in the Mission Impossible movies. But the movie is a far cry from those well-made spy thrillers. Reacher is limited by a lack of originality and hampered by thematic cliches and generic action sequences.Reacher is tough cunning and ruthless. He also is a tortured soul. He pops up in the least expected places and fends off attackers by the dozen. Its a part that would seem tailor-made for Cruise. Except that the character as written on the page -- based on the ninth of Childs 17 Reacher novels -- is tall and blond. Hes also sharp-witted but theres little evidence of that trait in the dialogue Cruise is given.Director Christopher McQuarrie worked with Cruise on Valkyrie which was one of the actors biggest missteps. A credible action star Cruises best performances have been playing complex villains in such films as 1999s Magnolia and 2004s Collateral.The movie sets up a subtle romance between Jack and Helen that is more about nuance than consummation. But then Jack is a solitary man. And in a nasty interaction with a girl in a bar he borders on misogynistic.In the books Reacher is all about eliminating injustice and meting out punishment to deserving bad guys. But in the movie he spends a lot of time in generic action hero mode simply running.Despite a terrific cast Jack Reacher comes up empty-handed. 46 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/RFBhQN",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/IhsvwgzCMXU/,200,jackreacher10,jackreacher,usatoday

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 21 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 21 2012 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Christopher McQuarrie Written by Christopher McQuarrie Starring Tom Cruise Rosemund Pike and Werner Herzog Country USA Language English What motivated Tom Cruise to want to play the character of Jack Reacher? A desire to race around in the vintage fast cars used in the film? A shot at a new franchise now that hes finished with Mission Impossible movies? Or just rampant vanity?The character of Reacher based on the novel One Shot the ninth in a series by British writer Jim Grant under the pseudonym Lee Child is a figure of wish-fulfillment virility - a massively built (6 foot 5 with a 50-inch chest) mathematically gifted former intelligence officer who lives as a bus-riding drifter and solves crimes that he stumbles across. Watch Jack Reacher official trailer Cruise is too mature diminutive and fine-looking for the role even if he has gym-sculpted abs which he manages to show off. Jack who travels light owns just one shirt from which he has to wash out the blood stains.Jack Reacher was written and directed by Brian Singers writing collaborator Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects Valkyrie) and it has few distinguishing characteristics except for some unfortunate real-life timing. The film begins with a sniper in Pittsburgh hiding in a raised parking garage and picking off five innocent people including a nanny with a child across the river. The resonance of the Sandy Hook shootings is unavoidable and its no wonder the Pittsburgh premiere of the film was cancelled last week.The films opening is also Jack Reachers most gripping sequence and the initial premise is intriguing. The suspected killer an Iraq war vet with a trigger-happy history named James Barr (Joseph Sikora) is in a coma. Before he went under he scrawled the phrase ""Get Jack Reacher"" on a pad. Reacher who heard of the event turns up on his own. He visits the District Attorney (Richard Jenkins in typical shifty mode) and a detective on the case (David Oyelowo) but they seem to have everything too neatly sewn up.The DAs rebellious daughter Helen (Rosamund Pike) is Barrs lawyer and she decides to hire Jack as her investigator or perhaps just to have his handsomeness around. After meeting Jack Helens character switches from sensible business wear to revealing push-up bras as she stares slack-jawed with lust at this paragon of male independence. Otherwise the story line owes something to one of Dashiell Hammetts ""dirty town"" tales of crime law and big money in collusion. Theres an international twist and an evil honcho played by director Werner Herzog with a milk blind eye. He describes in his lugubrious voice how once in a Siberian prison camp he chewed off his fingers to avoid gangrene which establishes hes a weirdo. Even Robert Duvall who hams it up as the grizzled ex-marine and owner of the local rifle range cant quite match that.Mostly the movies about Reacher delivering or shrugging off beatings engaging in car chases and planning complicated shootings. Though all women ogle him Reacher seems asexual a bit overfond of making pronouncements about his philosophy of rugged independence and as played by Cruise mostly robotic.World-weariness is not really the energetic stars best driving gear. Nor are declarations of menace intended to identify Jack Reacher as a modern-day mythic avenger. When he tells an enemy through his clenched choppers ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot"" the effect is unintentionally popcorn-spitting funny. Talk about overreaching.

Tom Cruise will never be John Wayne or Clint Eastwood not without shin implants but anyone who doubts he can be a heartless little bastard need only speak to Brooke Shields. Cruises Jack Reacher is a loner who doesnt smile charm love the ladies aim his index fingers to the heavens or sing ""Youve Lost That Lovin Feeling"" in bars. Here he just snarls and kills people. Yes please and lets have more of the same. I suppose those who loved ""Ghost Protocol"" will turn up again for ""Jack Reacher"" but if theyre paying attention theyll be disappointed because this is pretty much the opposite. Instead of a ridiculous plot and frantic stunts writer-director Christopher McQuarries adaptation of the Lee Child novel ""One Shot"" is a terse methodical procedural with a few snappy one-liners and only two fights one shootout and one car chase. The latter is 1970s- style with a lot of crunching steel and squealing wheels instead of digitally simulated objects hurtling improbably through space. Reacher is an ex-Army cop who lives completely off the grid. No one knows where he lives no credit card no drivers license. The man doesnt even tweet. When a sniper is arrested following the random shooting of four women and a man in Pittsburgh the suspect has only one request ""Find Jack Reacher."" The last honest wanderer in a landscape of pain. Too bad no one can ever find him but first surprise When you need him he finds you. Like the Tooth Fairy. Turns out the shooter and Jack have a history In Iraq Jack tried but failed to put him away for going nuts and shooting four contractors. This time the case is airtight. Cops even lifted the shooters thumbprint off a quarter he put in the meter. Jack has one question What mass murderer pays for parking? The detective stuff plays out satisfyingly in a return to form for a medium that has largely ceded procedurals to TV and though some of the one-liners are errant many are also laser-guided. In a fight over a lady who propositions lonesome Jack in a bar he corrects her brothers misimpression that he called her a whore ""No one said whore. You inferred hooker. I meant slut."" After beating up some dudes Jack says that if any failed to survive ""They died of shame. I was being gentle."" The topper though is a line I loved so much that -- no higher praise exists -- it could have been written for 1985 Arnold Schwarzenegger ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot."" From a boot While savoring duh lamentations of duh women maybe? Thanks to Cruises stone face Jacks one-liners never read as ingratiating or smarmy just hostile. There are a few lazy moments (especially at the end when they count the most) and some subsidiary figures are on the bland side (like Rosamund Pike as a defense lawyer Richard Jenkins as her father the DA and David Oyelowo as the cop). But there is expert support from two of the most formidable geezers in movies Werner Herzog and Robert Duvall. German filmmaker Herzog shows up as a fantastically icy villain who says ""When the soldier comes when you see how he dies it will change you."" A scene with his henchmen is so sick I was reminded of Monty Pythons Doug Piranha -- a criminal so scary he made men pull their own heads off. Duvall is a wily old Marine who owns a shooting range and joins Reacher for the fun of it. Duvalls ornery-cuss skills remain top-notch and (as with Herzog) I wish there had been more of him. Its touching beyond measure to see an ex-jarhead and a former soldier putting aside their differences in a display of mutual respect understanding and shooting bad guys in the face.

Starring Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike Robert Duvall Director Christopher McQuarrie Release Opened Dec 21 2012  Editorial Review Cruise swaggers as plot stumblesBy Ann HornadayFriday December 21 2012Presumably taking a long self-indulgent glance at his What Would Clint Do? bracelet Tom Cruise takes on the iconic role of surly vigilante in ""Jack Reacher"" resulting in a mismatch of wincingly epic proportions. And inveterate pro that he is Cruise never wants the audience to forget who it is up there flexing his shirtless abs on the screen. At a recent preview for ""Jack Reacher"" he appeared in a bizarre introduction -- all twinkly eyes and disarming grins -- during which he shamelessly tried to ingratiate himself with the audience thanking Reacher creator Lee Child and boasting that all his driving stunts were real not computer-generated. Its as if he were begging us to process the movie on two levels as pulpy popcorn genre entertainment and as another referendum on Cruises off-screen life (which this year involved a divorce and yet more whisperings about Scientology). Given that ""Jack Reacher"" arrives just one week after the massacre in Newtown Conn. the film will no doubt be perceived through another lens as it obsessively replays a chilling assassination during which a lone gunman methodically shoots random people in a Pittsburgh park including a nanny desperately cradling a young girl. The sequence filmed from the assassins view-finder was sickening even before the real world intruded but now more than ever the tableau raises the question of what motivated director Christopher McQuarrie to re-visit it with such ritualistic fascination. (It also presents yet another example of the perversity of the MPAAs ratings board which saw fit to give the grisly violence of ""Jack Reacher"" a PG-13 rating.) Then again this movie is designed primarily to put its leading man in as many cliched macho postures as possible whether its crouched behind the wheel of a lipstick-red vintage Chevelle or popping off perfect shots in a ballistic showdown. ""Im just a guy who wants to be left alone"" is just one eye-roller of a catchphrase uttered by Cruise whose character is a laconic Iraq war veteran summoned by the aforementioned shooter to exonerate him for mass murder. Working in cahoots with a beautiful defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) Reacher is a supposedly reluctant hero but with his penchant for grandstanding its difficult to imagine him turning down any opportunity to show off a nearly bottomless -- and increasingly monotonous -- store of Cool Guy-approved skills. (He even brings a knife to a gun fight and manages to win the day.) These include fending off five toughs with his bare hands escaping and evading police with the aplomb of a seasoned spook and dispatching the Two Stooges (who have ambushed him in a meth dealers house) by knocking their heads together nyuk-nyuk-nyuk style. When Reacher isnt swaggering his way through the Rust Belt hes knocking the ladies dead wherever he goes; one wonders during a scene at a rough-and-tumble saloon whether one of Cruises contractual demands is that he cant walk by a woman without eliciting a visible swoon. Its not that Cruise cant be That Guy. He plays a perfectly credible action hero in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise and there are few pleasures as profound as watching him subvert his own all-American screen image (see ""Magnolia"" and ""Tropic Thunder""). But ""Jack Reacher"" is a wildly ill-advised miscalculation with Cruises virtually unstoppable appeal butting uncomfortably against Reachers alternately cocky and downright crude cynicism. By the time Reacher miraculously solves the crime and saves the day in the midst of a driving rainstorm the only thing Cruise looks drenched in is self-regard.Contains profanity and some drug material.

Tom Cruise and Rosamund Pike star in ""Jack Reacher"" about a homicide investigation. Photo Paramount Jack Reacher review just average 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Jack Reacher Action. Starring Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike and Werner Herzog. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie. (PG-13. 130 minutes.) The most unfortunate single shot in a movie this year comes in the opening minutes of ""Jack Reacher."" A sniper high up in a car park is looking down at a city scene through a scope with the intent of murdering random people going about their business. We see the potential victims through the crosshairs - the movie invites us to identify not with innocent people but with the assassins power. And then for an endless second and a half through the crosshairs we see a little girl. This is unfortunate timing for ""Jack Reacher"" because no one wants to see such a thing especially this week. But its also unfortunate in general in that this is what constitutes family entertainment in America The MPAA rated this movie PG-13 just as it did ""The Dark Knight Rises."" As far as the MPAA is concerned its completely OK for children to see the soul-contorting depiction of random senseless murder. Nice job guys. Based on the book by Lee Child ""Jack Reacher"" is the story of a stern former military man who is hired to investigate what at first looks like an open-and-shut case. As devised by Child Reacher is a massively built guy and so Cruise is on the diminutive side to be playing him. But dont underestimate Cruises will and his ability to convey single-mindedness. Like Paul McCartneys music Cruises acting is easy to dismiss when you havent experienced it in a while. But when you encounter it - not the idea of it but the genuine article - you know the man has something. A routine thriller automatically gets a lift. It cant really be garbage if its a Tom Cruise movie. Hes an actor who can make you believe that he can beat a man unconscious with the head of another man who is also unconscious. He seems just crazy enough to do such a thing. In another scene faced with the prospect of fighting five guys outside a bar he is so unworried so sure of how this has to go that you really wonder why the other fellows even bother. Like every action star Reacher needs a formidable woman and a diabolical adversary. He gets the former in Rosamund Pike who plays a defense attorney his employer. And he gets the latter in Werner Herzog the great director who is slumming here though he plays a villain in keeping with his fascination for lifes extremes. In the films most memorable scene he tells a man that he will spare his life but only if he will eat all the fingers of one hand. Yes he tells a man to eat his own fingers. The whole audience squirms. By now youre getting the idea an average action film made slightly better by Cruise and more bizarre by Herzog and more watchable by Pike but still within the average range a silk purse that still says oink. Incidentally Cruise who turned 50 in July looks amazing and hes in remarkable shape though he would probably do best to keep his shirt on from now on. Just something that happens at around 48 or 49 no matter how good you look It doesnt hurt to keep the shirt on and it might hurt (other people) to take it off. This is something Roger Daltrey should have learned 20 years ago and instead we had that uncomfortable bare-chest sighting at the Sandy concert on Dec. 12. Cruise doesnt need to go down that road. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Jack Reacher review Armed vigilante has poor timing | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJack Reacher review Armed vigilante has poor timingTom Cruise makes a convincing title vigilante in Jack Reacher but is the ""why"" more important than the ""who"" in violent movies such as these?Tom Cruise left is surprisingly convincing as the title vigilante alongside a droll Robert Duvall in Jack Reacher.  (Paramount)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 20 2012 Jack Reacher (out of 4) Starring Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike Robert Duvall David Oyelowo Richard Jenkins and Werner Herzog. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. 131 minutes. Opens Dec. 21 at major theatres. 14A ""Who the hell is Jack Reacher?"" people keep saying about Tom Cruises title character in Jack Reacher and well they might ask. Although ""why"" is the better question. Reacher is a recurring character in a novel series by the author Lee Child books so pulpy they almost leave juice stains on the pages. Hes an ex-cop ex-military hard nut who travels by bus around America violently defending the weak and innocent against the strong and culpable. Blunt as a fist (his preferred weapon) and resistant to romance hes also something of a phantom taking pains to erase his tracks and sever all personal ties. Cruise has described Reacher as a combo of Clint Eastwoods Dirty Harry and Outlaw Josey Wales characters and that certainly applies to Reachers street-justice attitudes. Cruise also compares Reacher to James Bond although Id argue hes closer to the modernincarnations of Sherlock Holmes given his penchant for making arcane deductions -- such as why a killer would stop to put a quarter into a parking meter. You could even measure Reacher against the Batman seen in Christopher Nolans superhero trilogy whom Christian Bale plays with a hoarse Clint Eastwood voice. It all comes full circle but then all such characters blur into something you could call the Vigilante With a Thousand Faces (with apologies to mythologist Joseph Campbell). This brings us back to the ""why"" question. At a time when America seems absolutely infected with gun violence last weeks Connecticut schoolhouse massacre being the most horrific of all such tragedies you have to wonder why we continue to make and go to pictures such as Jack Reacher. The film opens with a sniper calmly picking off five victims in a waterfront park in Pittsburgh. The crosshairs find a target a finger squeezes the trigger and a body falls as blood and tissue erupt. There probably couldnt be a worse timing for this film to open unless it had been last Friday the day the school shooting horror occurred. Who really wants to see something like this right now? But I also wonder if its fair to put too much of a burden upon Jack Reacher which is no worse and maybe a little better than most of the vigilante movies that clutter the multiplex. And the story is about bringing a crazed sniper to justice albeit a ""justice"" not concerned with the civility of law. Cruise makes a convincing Reacher no mean feat considering he stands a good nine inches shorter than the 6-foot-5 height the author assigns his man in the book series. More important Cruise stands and delivers making you believe that he can take on five guys in a parking-lot brawl while barely cracking a sweat. Hes portrayed versions of this character before but he seems to pull Reacher from some deeper well of personal conviction the notion of one good man against a corrupt world that so often seems to energize him both on and off the screen. Pity that the film hes in written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie suffers from the same bloat affecting so many movies of late. What could be a taut 90 minutes turns into a puffy 130 as McQuarrie attempts to pack as many characters and twists into his plot as he did for his screenplay for The Usual Suspects. McQuarrie has a quixotic sense of casting. He hires such usual competent suspects as Richard Jenkins Rosamund Pike and David Oyelowo to play various hardboiled representatives of the legal system. Then he takes a walk on the wild side by tapping Robert Duvall to play a humorous rifle range owner (talk about your contradiction in terms) and documentary filmmaker Werner Herzog to play an over-the-top villain known as ""the Zec."" Herzog gets some of the ripest lines in McQuarries citrus dialogue the highlight being a speech where he describes eating the fingers off both his hands as survival tactics while incarcerated in a prison hellhole. McQuarrie seems to have ghoulish sustenance on the brain. At one point Reacher vows to his criminal prey ""Ill drink your blood from my boot."" In happier times rarer of late such macho banter would make for a merry time at the movies. Today its not so easy to laugh especially as we wonder if films like Jack Reacher are a cause or a symptom of the worlds violent affliction.

Cruise plays a former military cop investigating a sniper case. By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 20 December 2012 0155 PM Updated 20 December 2012 0155 PM The pulpy new action thriller Jack Reacher finds Tom Cruise in nonchalant combat mode sporting an impassive efficient swagger.The movie gets mighty thin and improbable -- it is after all based on a Lee Child novel -- but as the details mount and the star does what stars do it starts to seem like a good bag of potato chips. Theres no nutritional value but darned if you dont keep eating.Cruise is the title character a former MP who walks a fine line between enigma and cipher. A dirty fighter who dispatches gangs of hoodlums with barely a drop of sweat expended Reacher stays one step ahead of the cops lawyers and thugs who surround him. Hes like Charles Bronson with better looks and a vaguely altruistic side.The movie opens with a sniper firing on what seem to be random civilians outside Pittsburghs PNC Park. (The scene reminiscent of Peter Bogdanovichs Targets is chilling in the wake of the Newtown Conn. massacre; the movies big Pittsburgh premiere was canceled last weekend.) The suspect is apprehended and asks the police to find Jack Reacher. Why him? What does he know? A more pertinent question as the minutes and bodies pile up Who cares?Thats not a condemnation merely a way of observing that plot isnt Jack Reachers foremost concern. This isnt a coherent story so much as a mechanism an often witty series of transitions from one bit of mayhem to the next. Want a killer chase scene featuring a red Chevy Chevelle SS? You got it. Some slapstick combat that could have come from a particularly brutal Three Stooges dust-up? Check. By the time Robert Duvall shows up as a crusty old shooting- range proprietor youre ready to just go along for the ride.The writer-director is Christopher McQuarrie an Oscar winner for his Usual Suspects screenplay and the man behind the underrated kidnapping caper The Way of the Gun. McQuarrie has a way with criminal banter and underworld decorum.Here he also has Werner Herzog the German filmmaker who sinks his teeth into the role of a hissing heavy whos seen it all. It doesnt really matter who he is or what he wants. Hes here and hes having a good time.

With Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike Robert Duvall Watch Clips Who He Was Who He Was Credit Paramount Pictures Walk Away Walk Away Credit Paramount Pictures Whenever James Stewart played a character he was always a little bit James Stewart; thats a good thing. Cary Grant was always a little bit Cary Grant -- also a good thing. But Tom Cruise through a career thats spanned some 30 years is almost always very much Tom Cruise. And that particularly in Jack Reacher can be a very tiresome thing. Among those who have read and loved Lee Childs enormously popular Jack Reacher novels the big complaint about Cruises having cast himself as Childs burly laconic protagonist is that hes the wrong physical type. Cruise doesnt have the strapping stature of Childs Reacher although he is extraordinarily fit -- lest we fail to notice he appears shirtless several times in the picture. Hes also pretty good at pulling off the hand-to-hand combat at which Reacher excels. The bigger problem is that Cruise as Reacher has no wit and no style other than the studiously applied kind. Hes so desperate to do everything right that nearly everything he does comes off all wrong. And though director Christopher McQuarrie -- who also adapted the screenplay from Childs novel One Shot -- shows some visual intelligence he doesnt do enough to goad Cruise into giving this performance some shape. Cruises idea of characterization consists chiefly of glaring and tightening his jawline. How could readers who love Jack Reacher not expect more? At least McQuarrie a veteran screenwriter who made his big splash with The Usual Suspects and also did some reworking of last years moderately enjoyable Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol has good storytelling instincts. (This is the second film hes directed; the first was 2000s The Way of the Gun with Ryan Phillippe and Benicio Del Toro.) The picture opens with an extended wordless sequence that sets up the plot in precise visual language A man whom we later learn -- or believe -- is a trained Army sniper heads to a specific urban locale in Pittsburgh and coolly picks off five human beings in the span of a few minutes. The suspect an anonymous-looking guy named Barr (Joseph Sikora) is immediately arrested and taken into custody where hes quizzed by a detective (David Oyelowo) and the DA (Richard Jenkins). The two try to force a confession out of the suspect but instead he scrawls on a sheet of paper ""Get Jack Reacher."" Enter Reacher -- eventually at least. Reacher is a former Army investigator now a drifter who moves hither and yon taking action whenever justice needs to be served. (In one case he does so by bashing the craniums of two meatheads together until the poor sods fall into a heap on the floor.) Reacher knows something about Barrs past and he agrees -- or at least doesnt refuse -- to help the mans attorney (Rosamund Pike) who also happens to be the DAs daughter keep the guy off death row. i Emerson (David Oyelowo) helps investigate the case which is much more complicated than it appears. Karen Ballard/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Karen Ballard/Paramount Pictures Emerson (David Oyelowo) helps investigate the case which is much more complicated than it appears. Karen Ballard/Paramount Pictures Through it all Cruises Reacher breaks the limbs of thugs as if they were twigs makes wry remarks that dont quite qualify as jokes and drives fast cars crazily though the streets and the forlorn outskirts of Pittsburgh. Watching Cruise wrestle the role of Reacher into submission isnt exactly painful but it isnt particularly enjoyable either. Even when Cruise allows himself to be the butt of a joke -- when for example Reacher is being assaulted by guys with heavy-duty automatic weapons and looks down forlornly at the weapon in his hands a knife -- hes always in complete control; he can never relax and let go. Theres more than a whiff of desperation in the performance When Reacher enters a bar or any other place where womenfolk tend to congregate the ladies in the room fix the female gaze upon him with a ""Whats that aftershave youre wearing?"" intensity. Naturally Reacher is hot and obviously irresistible to women. But Cruise plays these moments with faux-cool cockiness that speaks more to his own middle-age insecurity than to anything inherent in Reachers character. And again Cruise never passes up a chance to show what a great bod hes got. (Pike an actress whos generally cool as a cuke is called upon to act flustered when shes treated to an eyeful of Reachers brawny bare pecs.) Luckily there are other actors to look at here and they manage to throw off some intelligent energy when theyre around Werner Herzog plays a mysterious baddie with a milky eye and a silky voice and Robert Duvall as an extremely helpful ex-Marine steps in at the 11th hour to show Cruise a thing or two about how to sling a joke. (His buoyancy even when hes playing your stock squinty-eyed Marine type is key.) But none of it is enough to make Jack Reacher exciting or even just vaguely fun. The picture is joyless and perfunctory. Call it Mission Possible.

Its difficult sometimes but I always try not to make up my mind one way or another until the final credits roll. But then you get a movie like ""Jack Reacher"" which makes you hate it. And then love it. And then hate it again going back and forth like some crazy tennis match until all thats left is to make a list of pros and cons to see how it all shakes out I hated ... the fact that the movie opens with a mass shooting. Yes its not the fault of writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (adapting Lee Childs novel ""One Shot"") that his movie is opening in the wake of the Newtown school massacre. But it is -- and you should be forewarned that the very first scene in this movie involves a gunman firing a high-powered rifle into a crowd of passersby outside of PNC Park in Pittsburgh. I loved ... that after I got over my initial discomfort at this unfortunately timed development I was able to admire the clinical efficiency with which McQuarrie captures the opening crime the subsequent investigation and the arrest of a suspect all in five or so very economical minutes. I loved ... how when said suspect refuses to talk or to sign a confession but instead scrawls ""GET JACK REACHER"" on a legal pad this origin-story movie takes its time to show us our heros face instead depicting him waking up in a Florida hotel room with a lady seeing the perp on CNN walking into Goodwill for a new wardrobe and hopping a bus to Pennsylvania before revealing him as ta-da Tom Cruise ladies and gentlemen I loved ... seeing two of my favorite current character actors Rosamund Pike (""An Education"" ""Made in Dagenham"") and David Oyelowo (""Middle of Nowhere"") score a big paycheck by getting cast in a flashy Hollywood movie. I hated ... watching them get stuck playing respectively The Girl and The Cop Who Is Not as Awesome as Jack Reacher. I loved ... the airport-novel way that the plot unravels into onion layer after onion layer of conspiracy and misdirection and hidden motives and that at the center of the onion we find none other than legendary filmmaker Werner Herzog playing a creepy Russian kingpin missing fingers after his stint in a Siberian prison. I hated ... that said conspiracy plot makes less and less sense the more I think about it and that all the setups and frame-ups wind up seeming like a very complicated way to perform a fairly prosaic crime. I loved ... the no-nonsense car chase in which the cops pursue Reacher who is in turn pursuing the real bad guys who have set him up even though the lead-in to this chase involves Reacher miraculously catching up to henchman Charlie (the exceedingly forceful Jai Courtney) who has a several-mile head start in a city where he could have driven off in any direction. I loved and hated ... the music by Joe Kraemer which occasionally underscores the crime scenes with all the piano-chords-of-doom and strings-of-danger youd imagine in an old Quinn Martin-produced 1970s cop show but then at other times works itself into so much of a lather that it overpowers whatevers happening visually. I loved ... how surprisingly funny ""Jack Reacher"" is from a throwaway gag regarding the name of an auto parts store (my favorite out-of-nowhere joke in 2012 since the billboards in ""21 Jump Street"") to a fight scene that becomes slapstick brilliance to Cruises unbreakable deadpan to the much-needed third-act incredulity injected into the film by Robert Duvall as a salty old gun-range owner. So yes ultimately my enjoyment of ""Jack Reacher"" winds up outweighing my dislike but it was a bumpy road to get there. If youre ready for that kind of jostling take the trip yourself.

First theres the backlash from devotees of the Lee Child fiction series on which its based who whine that Tom Cruise is too diminutive to play the fullback-sized maverick of the books. Then in the opening sequence a chillingly efficient sniper picks off several innocent pedestrians one by one evoking squirm-inducing images of the Newtown school massacre. But as he can do in his sleep by now Cruise puts on his tough face and quickly takes command of the screen as Reacher a military MP turned maverick homicide investigator a nomad who can only be found when he damn well wants to be. By playing Reacher as lithe bantam rooster rather than lumbering battering ram Cruise is actually more fun to watch fight than a large man would be -- a good thing because theres a whole lot of fisticuffs and even a little forehead-banging to get through before Reacher can catch his breath. The accused sniper who has gotten away with a similar spree before under different circumstances asks the cops to get Reacher a puzzling move as Reacher is aware of his earlier crime. Reacher shows up and begins investigating. After a few sidetracks including handily wasting five guys who pick a fight with him in a bar and a visit to a shooting range run by an ex-Marine (Robert Duvall) Reacher starts doubting the snipers guilt and goes on the hunt for the real culprits and their motives. Director Christopher McQuarrie who wrote the Cruise film ""Valkyrie"" and is slated to write ""Mission Impossible 5"" knows how to get the best from the star taking him to the edge of over-the-top. Shot in Pittsburgh -- a steely backdrop for a steely guy who still turns in a mean shirtless scene at 50 -- the movie is muscle-car chase-scene Chevy heaven with Reacher tearing around in a cherry vintage Chevelle. Karen Ballard Paramount Pictures Jai Courtney as Charlie and Tom Cruise as ""Jack Reacher."" As the alleged snipers defense attorney Helen Rosamund Pike (""Pride and Prejudice"") is given more to do than the usual female prop and it doesnt even include sex -- even when facing imminent violent death Helen somehow keeps her hose-sheathed knees together. Richard Jenkins (what hasnt he been in?) who plays her D.A. daddy is always a pleasure whether sincere or sinister (which one he is here is in doubt). Reacher may be ""an analog man in a digital world"" as Cruise told David Letterman the other night but hes also an occasional quipster tossing off understated one-liners that elevate the otherwise standard dialogue. More laughs though unintentional ensue from the odd casting of renowned director Werner Herzog as a bad guy nicknamed ""The Zec"" who earned his cred by biting off the fingers of his left hand while imprisoned in Siberia. ""Think youre tough? I made tapas out of my own knuckles"" Kidding but he does deliver cringers like ""You say nothing but I see defiance in your eyes."" The esteemed director may now cross ""Play cartoonish Bond villain"" off his bucket list.

"Timing is off on a dull Jack Reacher - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Timing is off on a dull Jack Reacher Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 12.20.12 | 112 PM The movies dont always have the best timing. Sometimes they arrive when you need them least. The opening sequence of ""Jack Reacher"" asks us to watch through a snipers crosshairs as people stroll past. It then asks us to watch them die and replays the sequence later for purposes of forensics. If youre aware of last weeks events at Sandy Hook Elementary School it is uncomfortable to sit and witness say a rifle target a woman holding a little girl from the assassins point of view. The movie is asking us to escape from fresh horror into this stale manufactured variety. Its utterly innocent of what it evokes and very much the product of a culture in which such massacres take place. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Fortunately the captain of all this staleness (that opening sequence really is just like every other such sequence the movies and TV have given us) is Tom Cruise. Hes the Jack Reacher of the title a former supersoldier who lusts only for justice. Hes a drifter. Hes removed himself from the grid. Hell resurface when summoned. So when the man accused of being the sniper is taken into custody his only instruction to the Pittsburgh prosecutors (Richard Jenkins and David Oyelowo) are ""Get Jack Reacher."" And so arrives this neat-looking compact man in jeans and a variation on a brown leather bomber jacket and he is ready to crack the case Who framed the suspect? Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It took a single scene to realize that I didnt care. ""Jack Reacher"" is based on the remorseless loner who has appeared in 17 novels written by Lee Child specifically 2005s ""One Shot."" Hes a man of few words. But Christopher McQuarrie the writer of ""The Usual Suspects"" wrote the script and directed the movie and he makes Reacher the quippiest man in the room. With little zip or foreboding or filmmaking McQuarrie has rigged the movie for Cruise. No one is as smart or strong or brilliant at piecing together the details of a case as Reacher. Everyone around him is exposed as incompetent or shortsighted or stupid or Werner Herzog who brings just the right touch of sadistic evil to his empty villains role. Cruise has been paired with the English actress Rosemund Pike playing the defense attorney who more or less hires Reacher to do her investigating. Pike has been wonderful in everything from ""Die Another Day"" to ""Pride amp; Prejudice"" and ""An Education."" I dont know whether it is the hassle of having to do an impossible regional accent or the stress of working with a star who thinks his breasts are nicer than hers but next to Cruise shes comatose. He has better chemistry with Robert Duvall who plays the crusty owner of a gun shop. Theres no tension anywhere in this movie. An atrocity has been committed and the most interesting treatment of that event is a loving sequence that attempts to explain who the victims were. But Reacher wont even allow the facts presented in that sequence to stand. Hes the moral equivalent of a tennis father The truth is never true enough for him. This is the kind of walk-on-water superiority that Julia Roberts has build a career on. The appeal of Cruise is that hes always pulling himself out of quicksand. All he does here is throw people in. Hes got the mystery all wrong for a part like this. For instance how far off the grid could a man with that skin and military haircut and those jeans fall? Whos his colorist? Whos his dentist? Whos his personal trainer? At 50 Cruise has never looked more like Tom Cruise. In that jacket and with that hair it might as well be 1986. This movie is the height of by-the-book dullness. But his commitment to stopping terror punishing mass murderers and righting wrongs remains admirable crazy and vain. Hes so committed to saving us from atrocity and mediocrity that he doesnt even think to save himself. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Movie review Jack Reacher is too much of a stretch for Tom Cruise - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Jack Reacher is too much of a stretch for Tom CruiseChristopher McQuarries Jack Reacher springs from Lee Childs series about a damaged ex-military man. Unfortunately Tom Cruise doesnt have the physicality or the ability to show the inner pain of the character to make the movie work.December 20 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic In ""Jack Reacher"" the new thriller starring Tom Cruise the crime that draws the films reclusive ex-Army investigator out of the shadows a a sniper gunning down people on a city street a couldnt have been a worse one to land in theaters just days after the horror of the Connecticut elementary school massacre (the studio delayed the films release in the area).If a movie is compelling and artistic in its own right it can survive the impact of these sorts of terrible real-life events as ""Dark Knight Rises"" was forced to do over the summer after a gunman opened fire in a Colorado theater. But so thrill-less so chill-less is ""Jack Reacher"" that it is unlikely to spark interest much less controversy.It no doubt seemed a smart choice to put this adaptation of the novel ""One Shot"" which falls about midway through Lee Childs Jack Reacher series into the hands of filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie. His first script featured the clever criminal mind game of 1995s ""The Usual Suspects."" Directed by Bryan Singer it essentially became Hollywoods version of a bulls-eye and other McQuarrie action/crime scripts followed.MOVIE REVIEWS Latest from the TimesBut his directing debut with 2000s ""The Way of the Gun"" was a disappointment a more style than substance. ""Reacher"" marks McQuarries second time in the directors chair and I fear it too will go the way of the ""Gun."""");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;The challenge for star and filmmaker is Reacher himself. As constructed by Child Reacher is so damaged by his military days that no one is allowed to get emotionally close. Even the running monologue in his head is clipped sarcastic forever reassessing the odds. The exterior man is if possible even more brisk brash and when necessary brutal a giant of a man with the kind of training in fire power and hand-to-hand that make him impossible to stop.Its a great character but one that doesnt suit Cruise. In Reachers case size matters a its integral to the way he wins the day. Tightly wound Cruise can do; physically overpowering is a stretch. But its Reachers interior life that is the real issue. He communicates a world of hurt a absorbed and dispensed a in his cool calculating looks. The actor can do cool and calculating its the meaning behind it that never flickers to life. ""Jack Reacher"" plays like Cruise on cruise control.As the film gets underway a sniper is picking off people strolling along the Pittsburgh downtown river walk on a sunny day. By the time the six-rounds of his high-powered rifle are expended five people are lying dead on the esplanade. It seems random.Thousands of miles away Reacher is enjoying the beach beverages and a beauty when reports of the killings surface. Something sounds familiar to Reacher about the crime and when he hears the name of the man arrested James Barr (Joseph Sikora) he is on the road to the Rust Belt. Reacher and Barr have met before and not as friends. Which makes it all more confusing when Barr scrawls the words ""Get Jack Reacher"" during the police interrogation and nothing more.Or it would have been had the filmmakers not made the bizarre choice to veer from the book and reveal one major major clue at the very beginning of the film. Even with director of photography Caleb Deschanels skill at both up-close-and-personal and out-of-control action the tension in ""Reacher"" keeps escaping like a tire with a slow leak. Anyone who has read Childs page-turning fiction will moan.Rosamund Pike plays Helen Rodin the local attorney who brooks her firms resistance to take on the sniper case. Shes got daddy issues that quickly factor in since the elder Rodin (Richard Jenkins) is the D.A. Heading the police investigation is Emerson (David Oyelowo) though with a pile of incriminating evidence theres little to do.It will take Reacher a few days of diving into the underbelly of Pittsburghs industrial scene to uncover what really happened on that sunny day. He is soon on the trail of a major bad guy called the Zec with filmmaker and occasional actor Werner Herzog the only one in the film who actually succeeds in making your skin crawl. Robert Duvall turns up in a nice cameo as a gun range owner thankfully without a Texas accent."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;The brightest spot is Pike who proves shes even more of an actress than I realized from her fine turns in ""An Education"" and ""Made in Dagenham"" by getting all hot and bothered every time shes around Reacher.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday December 20 2012 202 PM Title Jack Reacher Film Info PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. A month ago the biggest controversy about Christopher McQuarries ""Jack Reacher"" was whether Tom Cruise could appropriately portray the massively built 6-foot 5-inch hero imagined by author Lee Child. Today the movie has been impacted more significantly by timing. Right now its hard to consider even a popcorn flick escapist entertainment when it opens with a deadly sniper attack. But if were judging the picture on its own terms it succeeds pretty well -- and almost solely because of Cruise in the lead. He is undoubtedly a physical mismatch for Childs creation. Jason Clarke Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon are just a few of the actors who would have made a better fit. But of course none are international icons who chose to produce this project. So Cruise it is and you know what? Thats okay. No superstar is more reliable -- or oddly more underrated as an actor. He doesnt turn in his finest work frankly but hes still a solid presence who holds together an otherwise generic thriller. This entry undoubtedly expected to inspire sequels is based on the novel ""One Shot."" A killer coolly shoots several innocent citizens in a public square and then demands to see Reacher once hes caught. A fiercely independent Army veteran who served in Iraq with the gunman Reacher offers to help Helen (Rosamund Pike) the defending attorney unravel what happened. The D.A. (Richard Jenkins) and lead investigator (David Oyelowo) want to solve the crime themselves. But Reacher has his own ways of doing things. Unfortunately these ways arent particularly exciting. And most of the supporting cast isnt given much to do. Pike is especially bland making Helen a weak figure who has no chemistry with Reachers mysterious loner. Far more interesting are Robert Duvall as a wry gun shop owner and Werner Herzog as a deadpan sociopath. Cruises tightly controlled performance holds our attention all the way through to the tense finale. Still McQuarries script never gets at the heart of a character whos already inspired such a passionate fan base. Its an odd way to start a franchise but then Reacher probably wouldnt want us to know too much about him anyway.

Slideshow Off-the-grid tough guy pursues a sniper Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Jack Reacher >> The Jack Reacher played by Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher is one of those guys. ""You think?"" a woman says responding to one of his sage observations. ""All the time"" Reacher replies. ""You should try it."" Whoa what a put-down This dude would kill in the seventh grade. Speaking of killing (sigh) Jack Reacher - adapted from One Shot one of the Lee Child novels starring the ex-Army hotshot investigator - is what brings Reacher to Pittsburgh A sniper has taken down five strangers walking along the riverfront on a sunny day and although the shooters aim is deadly and his demeanor deathly calm the evidence he leaves behind is a homicide investigators dream. Practically before the opening credits are over James Mark Barr (Joseph Sikora) has been arrested and charged with the crime. But instead of signing the confession pushed in front of him in the interrogation room Barr scrawls ""Get Jack Reacher"" on the page. And somehow Reacher who has been off the grid for two years (he travels by bus pays in cash doesnt carry a change of clothes) answers the call. I cant pretend to know what drew Cruise - who after all is Ethan Hunt in the thriving Mission Impossible franchise - to play this charmless unironic macho hero. Reacher does get to punch swarms of punks and rev a muscle car over the Steel City hills and he gets Rosamund Pike to look at him like shes going to swoon. Maybe thats enough. Pike is Helen Rodin the defense attorney picked to represent Barr. Her dad (Richard Jenkins) happens to be the citys district attorney working with Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo from The Paperboy) to send Barr to jail for the rest of his life. But Reacher thinks its too perfect a case. When he starts being followed and threatened seduced in a bar booth and clunked on the head in a bathtub hes even more certain. Hes nobodys fool this Reacher. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie who won an Oscar for his wickedly smart The Usual Suspects screenplay (and who scripted the Cruise Nazi thriller Valkyrie) Jack Reacher pushes its formula plot toward a big nighttime shootout in an excavation site. The violence is plenty and pointless. Robert Duvall shows up as an ornery rifleman who gives Reacher cover as he moves in to deal with the bad guys and ace documentarian Werner Herzog in a rare turn as a Hollywood villain is a one-eyed coot who chewed his fingers off rather than lose them to frostbite. At least thats what he says trying to impress anyone who will listen with his alarming evilness. And his alarming accent. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

(MCT) Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Lee Childs paperback hero comes to the big screen in this thriller about a sniper shooting that may be more complicated than it seems. BOTTOM LINE Cruise still fits into his action-hero jeans but this laughably macho role borders on self-parody. Kudos to German filmmaker Herzog weirdly cast as the movies villain for keeping a straight face. CAST Tom Cruise Robert Duvall Rosamund Pike Werner Herzog. LENGTH 210 Theres a fine line between macho wish fulfillment and delusional fantasy and ""Jack Reacher"" crosses it. Reacher played by Tom Cruise in tight jeans and sometimes a shirt is always the smartest strongest and fastest and the only thing slowing him down are all the gorgeous women in his way. When five guys pick a fight with Reacher he feels only sadness -- for the hellacious beating theyre about to receive. It all gets pretty insufferable but ""Jack Reacher"" doesnt seem to realize this. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") is so caught up in his Mickey Spillane world that he cant tell when his movie starts tipping into self-parody. (Answer Immediately.) Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Late nights convention takes Who did it best? In this story Reacher a former military cop turned drifter begins investigating the case of a Pittsburgh sniper accused of mowing down several innocent citizens. (Images of a nanny clutching a little girl may come too soon after the Sandy Hook shootings for some viewers; Paramount has excised some gunplay from the films trailer.) Police Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) already has his man but Reacher isnt convinced. The suspects idealistic attorney Helen Rodin (an ill-used Rosamund Pike) hires Reacher to find out more. What he finds weirdly enough is Werner Herzog the acclaimed German filmmaker slumming as a finger-eating villain named The Zec. Herzog fans will relish the stunt casting though others may wonder what purpose his character serves. (Answer None.) ""Jack Reacher"" is never truly hard-hitting (the PG-13 rating sees to that) nor is it terribly inventive (its based on Lee Childs sturdy airport novel ""One Shot""). In the end its just a corny slugfest thats impossible to take seriously. 157 VideoTrailer Jack Reacher PLOT Lee Childs paperback hero comes to the big screen in this thriller about a sniper shooting that may be more complicated than it seems. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (violence language) CAST Tom Cruise Robert Duvall Rosamund Pike Werner Herzog.

"Jack Reacher (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jack Reacher (PG-13) A robotic Tom Cruise makes for a dull hero in this otherwise engaging detective story. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/20/2012 Editor rating 2 Halfway through Jack Reacher comes a prolonged car chase that appears to use little to no CGI with Tom Cruise clearly doing some of the driving himself. Director Christopher McQuarrie lets the scene play out without a musical score and the sequence is so well shot and edited that you are always aware of where each vehicle is in relation to the other as they barrel through the streets of Pittsburgh. There are no impossible stunts no gravity-defying feats no overturned fruit carts or smashed panes of glass. The sequence is just an old-school furious car chase and its a thrill to watch. Thats one of the few bits of prolonged action in Jack Reacher the first in an intended series based on Lee Childs popular novels about a former military police officer. On the page the character was six-foot-five had blond hair blue eyes and the physique of a bodybuilder. On the screen he looks like Cruise who shares none of those attributes. But this is a detective story -- a rather complicated one -- and Cruise marches through it in locked-jaw intense-stare mode. He makes you believe in Reachers uncanny ability to memorize details find clues discover secrets and even anticipate what other people are thinking. Reacher is so good at everything he does and Cruise plays him in such a robotic manner that the movie becomes a bit of a bore The hero is practically omnipotent. Theres a moment in the movie when two men with bats sneak up behind an unarmed Reacher and whack him in the back of the head knocking him inside a tiny bathroom and he still manages to beat them both up without a scratch. Jack Reacher is filled with scenes in which Cruise lays out elaborate conspiracy theories to an astonished detective (David Oyelowo) who wonders how this guy knows so much or a bewildered lawyer (Rosamund Pike) who often says things like ""Thats crazy"" before realizing Reacher was right. Hes always right. In an unfortunate coincidence Jack Reacher opens with a mass shooting in which a gunman kills five people and the movie is required to show us the sequence again and again from different angles as the investigators explore the case. The tragic timeliness is distracting. The film also goes on too long Once Reacher has figured out the truth theres still a half-hour of movie left most of it set at a rock quarry where gunfights and punches continue long after youre ready to go home. And although the central mystery is undeniably intriguing McQuarrie undercuts himself by casting Werner Herzog as a one-eyed villain so tough he once chewed off his own fingers and Robert Duvall as the joker-grandpa owner of a shooting range. Their characters are unintentionally funny but they also underscore how empty Cruises performance is. Reacher is a mysterious drifter and Cruise plays him as a cipher. He doesnt let us in. Jack Reacher has a compelling story hook and a realistic street-savvy vibe. What the movie sorely needs is a more intriguing detective -- a hero human enough to sometimes make mistakes.

Cast Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike Robert Duvall Richard Jenkins. Rating PG-13 for violence language and some drug material. RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Tom Cruise remains a man on a mission Author Lee Child on Jack Reachers One Shot By Kerry Lengel The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Dec 20 2012 1150 AM ""Jack Reacher"" the latest action vehicle for the not-quite-ageless Tom Cruise opens with a gripping sequence depicting a mass shooting. Photographed as a series of claustrophobic close-ups -- of gloves a rifle scope a quarter slipped fatefully into a parking meter -- it follows step-by-step as an expert gunman sets up across the waterfront from Pittsburghs baseball stadium and methodically guns down five seemingly random pedestrians. The films gala premiere Dec. 15 was postponed after the unthinkable murders of 20 first-graders in Newtown Conn. the day before. But the setup almost certainly is inspired by the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks a mass shooting that has receded far enough in memory to be commandeered for mass entertainment. The tension between actual horrors and the Hollywood variety make for a curious viewing experience in ""Jack Reacher"" which lurches from gritty realism to over-the-top comic-book heroics. Based on the 2005 novel ""One Shot"" by British writer Lee Child its intended to expand a popular fiction franchise into film but the workmanlike direction of Christopher McQuarrie (""The Way of the Gun"") although sporadically entertaining may doom this flick to one-off status. Cruise who tapped McQuarrie as a script doctor for ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" is treading water (and looking slightly eroded) in the title role a former military investigator who spent most of his life overseas and now exists off the grid wandering from town to town in the country he served but never really knew. He heads to Pittsburgh to help bury the suspect in the sniper attacks a veteran who got away with a similar crime in Iraq. But when a crusading defense lawyer (Rosamund Pike) hires him to investigate further he uncovers an intricate frame job that will set up a climactic showdown with an international crime ring. The shootings it turns out werent quite so random after all. Reachers outsider experience gives him a cold-eyed perspective that aids in his investigation. Of course it doesnt hurt that he also has an eidetic memory expert training in martial arts and military weaponry and a stunt drivers skills behind the wheel. He also gets a little help from a crusty NRA type played by Robert Duvall who like Cruise doesnt seem to be working too hard at it. Far more interesting is the appearance of the legendary film director Werner Herzog (""Into the Abyss"" ""Grizzly Man"") as the villain a creepy Russian known only as the Zec (""prisoner""). In his one expansive scene he explains to an ineffective flunky how he chewed off his own fingers to survive frostbite then invites the hapless henchman to prove his determination to survive in similar fashion. Cruise too gets in his share of entertaining moments including a faceoff with five local toughs (Reacher explains precisely why hell only have to fight three of them) and the clever climax to the obligatory car chase (the best scene in the movie spoiled of course by the trailer). Such highlights though are outweighed by numerous detours into the ridiculous including a bit of bloody slapstick that sees Reacher bashing one bad guys skull with that of another as well as a climax in which the supposedly logical hero tosses away his weapon to go mano-a-mano with a beefcake baddie at least 6 inches taller than he. Fans of the novels will recognize the irony in this scene as the literary hero actually is 6-foot-5 as opposed to the 5-7 Cruise. In the movie version at least efforts to render the hero larger than life result in a story that is less than convincing.

"Jack Reacher review Timing is everything - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Timing is everything for Jack Reacher  1/2A satisfactory thriller but violent images echo outside the theaterDecember 20 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticConsidered outside the context of the bloody December so far ""Jack Reacher"" does its work sleekly and well. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie filmed the adaptation of the Lee Child book ""One Shot"" (one of many Reacher adventures) in Pittsburgh with cinematographer Caleb Deschanel lending the project a handsome burnished sheen.To be sure devotees of the Reacher novels have complained plenty about the casting of Tom Cruise as the ex-military policeman trained sniper and crack investigator. In the books hes a hulking 6-foot-5; Cruise is not. That bug you? It doesnt bug me. Whatever. Its just a few inches. Its not like casting Gollum in ""Magic Mike"" or something.In the production notes issued by Paramount Pictures Cruise describes Reacher as ""sort of a Dirty Harry a James Bond a Josey Wales."" This Cruise hopes puts the results determinedly in Eastwood country. Reacher is an avenging angel a man living by his own code of honor. A deductive genius and a drifter hes seen his share of horrors in war. Hes off the grid and in terms of righteously indignant slaughter off the charts.And heres the truth. The truth is we cannot drain a moviegoing experience of its context. ""Jack Reacher"" is not an easy movie to enjoy at this particular moment. Not in the wake of the Newtown Conn. school killings and the 28 dead.This happens with each new gun-related massacre in America. A violent movie opens following a shooting and the movies violence no longer plays the way it did the week before. ""Jack Reacher"" begins with five dead by a snipers bullets putting the audience in the catbird seat behind the scope of the shooters rifle. Its the perspective floating through so many gamers stray thoughts whether pretend killing in front of a screen or doing something else and wishing they were.""Jack Reacher"" sets up the title character as a steely smarty pants never wrong always righteous. The accused killer coming out of a coma asks for Reacher to help clear his name. They knew each other once. Rosamund Pike English by birth but American by accent husky-voices her way through the role of the defense attorney whos the daughter of the district attorney (Richard Jenkins). What is the truth behind this open-and-shut case? Who is involved in the probable conspiracy?A hint though not a spoiler It has something to do with the Russian mobster known as The Zec played by filmmaker Werner Herzog with a fake milky-blue eye. Hes not required to act here exactly; rather he must simply be and be scary. At one point he seethes ""I spent my first winter as a prisoner in Siberia wearing a dead mans coat. I chewed these fingers off before the frostbite could turn to gangrene."" This certainly takes your mind off all the glorified firearm violence on display.Robert Duvall has some fun as a shooting range owner who comes to the rescue during the (protracted) climax which takes place in a rock quarry at night. McQuarrie who wrote ""The Usual Suspects"" is a real writer; his banter has snap and bite. His directorial skills are still catching up with his writing skills; the movie loses steam in the final half-hour.Up until then its diverting stuff. But its not easy to take ""Jack Reacher"" in the intended escapist spirit. Not with so many close-ups of so many bullets and so many guns given their glinty moment in the sun.mjphillipstribune.comJack Reacher -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence language and some drug material)Running time 210Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesTom Cruise defends role as Jack ReacherDecember 11 2012Rosamund Pike Sam Neill join Long Way Down Pascal...September 17 2012Can Cher save Logo?January 17 2013Kelly Greyson Boards Spy Thriller Double IdentityJune 10 2014Why you should read genre booksOctober 26 2012Find More Stories AboutRosamund PikeTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1218-jack-reacher-20121220,0,505854.column",200,jackreacher28,jackreacher,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Jack Reacher is the embodiment of a certain kind of narrow alpha fantasy. He is the best at all the things the smartest detective the best driver the greatest fighter. In the army he earned all the medals including one obscure enough that the police investigating him have to look it up. He won the military shooting competition no one in his class had ever won before. He has a photographic memory. He can take on five men at a time in a brawl after out-bantering and accurately psychoanalyzing them. His mind works faster than anyone elses; he sees patterns no one else sees. He is Batman without the silly costume. He is the entire A-Team rolled up in one such that he can disappear like a ghost (though he somehow pulls his military pension each month) but will still walk into a room at the most dramatic moment just after someone has said ""You dont find this guy unless he wants to be found."" Naturally being so exceptional isolates him in his noble loneliness. He has judged the world and found it wanting. He doesnt have time for courtesy; he must speak to everyone with curt contempt. In particular he has no time for women who only exist in his world as victims to save or to manfully mourn. For those who buy into the extremity of his excellence--for those whose suspension of disbelief rivals the suspension system of the Golden Gate Bridge--hes a potent fantasy. But for everyone else it can be tiring listening to subsidiary characters go on and on about him or watching him stand three steps ahead of everyone else waiting with annoyance for them to catch up. Jack Reacher the first film adaptation drawn from Lee Childs Jack Reacher books (it adapts the ninth in the series 2005s One Shot) begins unimpeachably with a long tense wordless sequence. First a sniper methodically sets up in a Pittsburgh parking garage takes aim at the riverwalk and begins picking off people one by one. Then methodical police detective David Oyelowo leads an investigation assembling copious detailed evidence building an airtight case and apprehending the shooter. Only the audience knows Oyelowo somehow has the wrong man. Its a potent setup but its rendered laughable via hyperbole at every turn. Rosamund Pike steps in as defense attorney for the wrongly accused man (Joseph Sikora) but shes only doing it as a dramatic blow against her D.A. father (Richard Jenkins). Investigating the victims she learns each one of them had a cop-on-the-last-day-before-retirement tearjerker story One was a nanny who had just finished saving up enough money for a trip to China but had put it off just a few days in order to attend her charges 7th birthday. Another was buying tickets so her son could attend his very first baseball game as a reward for turning his life around. A third was just days away from her 10th wedding anniversary. (She explains all this in a weepy speech worthy of Phoebe Cates talking about her father in Gremlins.) And this level of heightened emotion and emphatic breast-beating continues when Tom Cruise enters the picture as Jack Reacher former military police investigator and only person on Earth capable of unpacking the conspiracy no one else knows exists. The trouble with Jack Reacher isnt the title characters world-class skills which come standard to heroes from Sherlock Holmes to James Bond to Superman. Its the films over-the-top tone in establishing them and its disinterest in anything else. For instance in Pike who seems to come with lifelong copious baggage involving her D.A. father. While their conflict is repeatedly mined for screaming drama its never actually explained. Pike contributes to the movie only as bait foil and sounding board; its her thankless job to float theory after theory on the audiences behalf so Cruise can dismissively put her in her place. Which he does with an utter lack of humanity. Cruise played a similarly capable hero in the Mission Impossible movies and cocky smug mavericks have been his stock in trade from Top Gun to Days Of Thunder to Minority Report to Knight And Day. But this one is a particularly poisonous variant one proud of his lack of human connection and without any meaningful chinks in his armor. When a young woman approaches him in a bar he shoots her down with a dismissive ""The cheapest woman tends to be the one you pay for."" About the closest the film comes to cracking a smile is when he methodically beats a man unconscious with another mans head. Theres an unpleasantly condescending moralizing tone to Jack Reacher worthy of Atlas Shrugged; his abilities are meant to justify anything he chooses to do whether its intimidating that bar-girl into giving him her car or murdering an unarmed man out of a sense of entitled justice. And thats a pity because the films action is solid. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie last directed in 2000 (his debut The Way Of The Gun) and his scripts include Valkyrie the upcoming Jack The Giant Slayer and the tight economical cult favorite The Usual Suspects which won him an Oscar. He stages fistfights a protracted gunfight and a long car chase with a welcome balance of visceral intensity and visual clarity. The wordless crime and investigation that opens Jack Reacher amounts to a lean stylish short film and the subsequent half-hour sparks with flat clipped ping-pong banter. When Robert Duvall eventually shows up as a gun-range owner with his own ways of judging people he sets the film on a more easygoing path where tension and thrills dont need to come at the expense of every non-Jack Reacher character and where bonding of a sort can take place even if only in its grimmest most emotionally protected form. And while the villain gets short shrift hes perfectly cast perhaps the only man in Hollywood that could pull off his thoroughly ridiculous character and background. (See Spoiler Space.) Even the mystery is relatively compelling. Though the central conspiracy turns on some unlikely villain choices its at least a bold and impressively elaborate plan and the film doles out revelations at a steady clip that almost justifies its 130-minute sprawl. In particular while the exploration of Sikoras history is largely used to further establish Reachers skills the sideline into his past complicates the story in ways that prevent it from proceeding predictably from point A to point B and that make Sikora more than yet another doe-eyed innocent. Perhaps most satisfyingly Jack Reacher takes combat seriously respecting the brutality of physical combat and the lethality of guns and only rarely shrugging off the impact of either. This amounts to a more realistic approach than anything else in the film. Again the problem isnt that Jack Reacher is terrific. The problem is that the film works so hard to pile on praise for an unlikeable unapproachable mechanical process of a man that it removes all stakes for the viewers. Theres a reason Keyser Soze doesnt take over the narrative of The Usual Suspects after Kevin Spacey tells his story He isnt a man hes a deliberately over-the-top legend. Similarly Jack Reacher isnt much of a man and Jack Reacher isnt the story of a man. Its mythmaking for self-satisfied sociopaths.

Hes also blonde ugly 65"" and 250 lbs which means the difference between the Reacher that fans love and Tom Cruise who plays him in his long-awaited film debut is literally sizable Ten inches and 90 lbs to be exact and a whole lot of handsome. Childs Jack Reacher is homeless and for the well-coiffed Cruise playing a guy who shops as Goodwill is as much of a stretch as hoping no one will notice his larger-than-life ex-military cop is barely taller than his co-star Rosamund Pike. (Which in real life hes not -- Pike towers over him by two inches.) In the original novel One Shot Reacher spends half of the book pacing the surprisingly mean streets of a sleepy Midwestern city trying to unravel a shocking sniper attack that left five civilians dead. The flick opens with the crime -- watching through crosshairs as the killer selects his targets is agonizingly tense -- and in eight minutes its solved and the murderer is in prison. Unlike in the book McQuarrie shows us something the police dont know the face of the killer is different than the man behind bars. Yet not only is the evidence against the accused so perfect that his lawyer (Pike) merely hopes to get his sentence reduced to life in prison here comes Jack Reacher the accuseds old enemy rolling into town on a Greyhound bus to make sure he gets the death penalty. Reacher is a brute with an odd moral code. When someone has what he wants -- be it information he needs or a sports car he wants to borrow -- hell twist their arms (literally) until its his. And hes not just mean to men hell leave women alone in dark alleys and hell call a barely legal bimbo a ""slut."" But if someone hurts that slut -- at least someone besides him -- he turns into a heat-seeking missile of muscles a jackal who wont stop running until he catches his prey. So bringing Jack Reacher to the screen means Cruise has a lot to measure up to but instead of swinging for the fences he bunts. His Reacher is like every other character Cruise has ever played Tough cocky and the smartest guy in the room. Its the Tom Cruise paradox; hes a great actor whos stopped acting. He cant vanish into a role but then he doesnt have to. Audiences show up to his films just to see his latest ass-kicking adventure which makes Cruise the inverse James Bond -- instead of different actors playing the same character hes one actor who plays the same character under a dozen different names. You could pretend his entire last decade onscreen is just Ethan Hunt going deep undercover to save the day. Luckily for director Christopher McQuarrie Jack Reacher is also tough cocky and the smartest guy in the room. A former Army policeman and genius investigator hes always three steps ahead of his rivals and he loves making sure they know it. Hes so physically gifted that he makes his attackers look like the Three Stooges and so mercilessly aggressive that he aims straight for his enemies eyes knees and groins. Even hanging up a payphone his elbow snaps like hed rather be breaking someones neck. And yet even this films last minute name change from One Shot to Jack Reacher does nothing to convince us that were watching a fictional Army vet named Jack Reacher -- were watching Tom Cruise and for fans of his thats enough. For fans of Childs books however the pleasures are more complicated. With oh 100 of the books 376 pages occupied by Reachers inward deductive reasoning McQuarrie faced the risk of a flick that was all voiceover. Instead he flips the script; Cruise silently pads around looking smart and were meant to see his the gears in his head grinding. The films more fun when he finally opens his mouth to insult his ever-growing list of enemies including a sour DA (Richard Jenkins) a cop who accuses him of murder (David Oyelowo) some rednecks (Alexia Fast and Josh Helman) a couple of vicious hitmen (Michael Raymond-James and Jai Courtney co-star of the next Die Hard) and the big boss a four-fingered Gulag survivor named The Zec (Werner Herzog). Herzog is perfect for the role hes made a career of grimly muttering ""death"" and ""murder."" Hes only in the movie for ten minutes -- far too short -- but he has one stand-out scene where he orders an underling to bite off his own thumb or get shot in the head an at-any-cost survival instinct that Herzogs been hunting for in his own films for decades. Alas the weakness of the film is the weakness of the book. The Zecs evil plan is both byzantinely complicated and pifflingly mundane. We already know the face of the killer. What we dont know is why and the big reveal is more of a ""Huh?"" McQuarrie the writer of The Usual Suspects who also adapted One Shot himself is still finding his legs as a director. Jack Reacher has the bright and empty look of television and is a bit unsteady as it wavers between action and laughs. But the flick is great entertainment as Reacher headbutts his way to the Zec dutifully and casually giving nods to devotees of the books even casting Lee Child in a cameo as a police officer who returns to Reacher the only thing he owns a portable toothbrush. (Explains Reacher in the book Bad Luck and Trouble ""I carry a spare shirt pretty soon Im carrying spare pants. Then Id need a suitcase. Next thing I know Ive got a house and a car and a savings plan and Im filling out all kinds of forms."") Beat by beat Jack Reacher is just like Childs paperbacks in the best possible way its fast fun and smarter than it looks. Will it give Tom Cruise another hit action franchise? It deserves to. Hollywood has 17 other Jack Reacher books to pick from any one of which would fit seamlessly into the Cruise canon. But for Child the real question is how many hit films will it take for Cruise fans to remember Jack Reachers name? Amy Nicholson is a critic playwright and editor.

Based on one in a series of numbing beach paperbacks (17 in all) by Lee Child about a mysterious assassin named Jack Reacher this film is deader than the corpses that litter the screen. Pick up one of these time-wasters at any airport bookstall and you will inevitably read a description of this cold-blooded wielder-of-weapons-of-mass-destruction as blonde blue-eyed six-foot-five--and built like The Incredible Hulk. In Jack Reacher he is played by Tom Cruise who is a 50-year-old testament to the miracles of Botox but in no way resembles Jack Reacher. Welcome to the movies. On a gray morning in Pittsburgh five people are randomly mowed down by a wacko soldier from the war in Iraq a skilled sniper with a carefully trained military history. Quickly apprehended dragged into custody and grilled extensively the suspect yields nothing except a weird note on which he scribbles ""Get Jack Reacher."" The next section of the movie (which is very long and very confusing--not to mention very boring) devotes itself to trying to finding the enigmatic mystery man. A former U.S. Army hotshot cop Purple Heart honoree and dropout from the human race Jack is an elusive loner with no mailing address telephone number bank account passport or government-issued I.D. Needless to say hes hard to reach. (He must have a drivers license though because he manages to destroy a multitude of cars before this interminable movie ends.) Anyway the sexy defense attorney (Rosamund Pike) manages to find him and lure him to Pennsylvania to help her crack the case and get justice for her client. Although the accused lies in a coma following a savage beating by the cops Jack identifies the guy and insists hes innocent. Since the face of the real killer has been revealed to the rest of us from the beginning we know this already. Now its up to Jack to expose the actual culprit and his motive. The more he pursues the truth the more elusive it becomes. The rest of the movie is about the ingenious ways Jack Reacher beats smacks and crunches the bad guys weaned on violence into human shrapnel smashing their skulls breaking their fingers poking their eyes out and kicking them in the groin turning them into sopranos. When anyone gets too close to identifying him as Jack Reacher he uses an alias of a second baseman on the New York Yankees. Based on One Shot the ninth book in Lee Childs series the ridiculous plot has something to do with a conspiracy to kill four innocent people to cover up the deliberate murder of the fifth victim for reasons that are as clear as a Rubiks Cube. Endless head-scratching clues eventually lead to ""Mr. Big""--a Russian gangster played by cult director Werner Herzog who should have taken the time to teach inept Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed Mr. Cruise in one of his biggest flops the ill-fated Valkyrie)how to mount a simple two-shot with conviction. Mr. Herzog and his goons land half of the cast in the morgue. Now somebody is out to kill Reacher and it might be the pretty blond defense lawyers own father the D.A. (a wasted Richard Jenkins). Adding to the confusion is the late entrance of a grizzled old gun seller (a wasted Robert Duvall) who pitches in to help Reacher kill off anybody who is still standing. It takes a veteran actor like Mr. Duvall to suppress a smirk and let you know hes aware of what a potboiler hes in. Cruise ""Can you take him out?"" Duvall ""To dinner you mean?"" None of it is remotely original. The films biggest action scene--a wild chase inside an underground tunnel with Reacher driving the wrong way--has been done a dozen times before most often by James Bond. The acting is an exercise in granite-faced self-restraint. There is a slight hint of romance when the blond attorney moves in close to his perfect picket-fence teeth with moist brow and trembling lips. But this is a Tom Cruise movie. No kissing no groping. Except for stripping down to prove a star can still be camera-ready after 50 if he invests in the right Nautilus equipment Mr. Cruise walks through the movie in a trance. Who can blame him with a script that forces him to say things like ""Im going to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot""? Inadvertently funny sure but Jack Reacher is mostly grim violent and stupid. rreedobserver.com JACK REACHER Running Time 131 minutes Written by Christopher McQuarrie (screenplay) and Lee Child (book) Directed by Christopher McQuarrie Starring Tom Cruise Rosamund Pike and Richard Jenkins Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/12/reacher-feature-in-jack-reacher-our-hero-shrinks-to-fit-the-silver-screen/,200,jackreacher31,jackreacher,com/2012/12/reacher-feature-in-jack-reacher-our-hero-shrinks-to-fit-the-silver-screen/

Cruising for targets the sniper aims his M1A Super Match rifle at ""the sweet spot where the medulla meets the spine."" Bang bang bang bang bang bang. Six shots five dead -- random victims whose only crime was being in the line of a madmans fire. Jack Reacher the very ordinary new Tom Cruise thriller may be a minor collateral victim of the Sandy Hook Elementary School carnage. Because it begins with this scene of a mass slaughter shown from the gunmans point of view the movie accidentally and automatically evokes obscene images of slain first-grade children. Those images will be in most Americans minds for a while certainly through the early run of the movie which opens Friday. Popular entertainment meant to relieve people of real-life cares by leading them into a fictional world occasionally grazes against some national trauma. That is the case with Jack Reacher. Appropriately Paramount Pictures postponed the Saturday evening premiere in Pittsburgh where the movie was filmed and where Cruise was to receive commendations from Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and Governor Tom Corbett. (READ Michael Crowley on Obamas Assertion That ""These Tragedies Must End"") In the U.S. mass murders and serial killings have become a serial of their own a frequently recurring horror movie featuring the same monster some resourceful lunatic whose atrocity contains no political agenda only an expression of indiscriminate rage. The mind behind the murders in Jack Reacher is something else; this is not a horror film but an old-fashioned detective story cocooned in violence. Were not spoiling any plot points (the identity of the sniper is revealed in Reachers first scene) to say that a tale like this is designed to give motive to madness to offer the relatively comforting explanation of a conspiracy among the prominent and powerful. Its the right genre -- just at this time of bereavement the wrong moment. Jack Reacher has two other goals to provide moviegoers with an incorruptible infallible savior -- the American dream man meant to prevent or avenge American nightmares -- and to hand Cruise a second franchise more modest than his globe-trotting hyper-expensive Mission Impossible series. (READ Corlisss review of Tom Cruises Mission Impossible 4) Lee Childs Reacher novels 17 by now portray an ex-Army investigator turned drifter whos part Travis McGee part Terminator and all avenging angel. Along with no fixed abode he has no car credit cards computer or cell phone. Hes like your indigent itinerant grandpa a hobo Abe Simpson except Reacher is six-five 250 and a master of martial and firearm arts. This taciturn hero -- the most frequent sentence in any Child novel is ""Reacher said nothing"" -- shows up at some crime scene detects fights solves and leaves. Though he travels on public bus lines (whose vendors take cash and dont bother with security patdowns) the books are best consumed on a crosscountry plane trip prime junk culture immediately diverting and instantly disposable. (READ Andrea Sachss Qamp;A with Lee Child) The attraction of the movie Jack Reacher based on One Shot the ninth volume in the series is that it aims no higher than the book the sweet spot where the childs appetite for heroic fantasy meets the NASCAR dads need for vicarious mayhem. Cruise as star and producer and Christopher McQuarrie the screenwriter and director are going for that B-movie crime vibe -- a tough man a blond a couple of gnarled city officials and a pack of lumpen goons -- with a gritty rust-belt milieu. In a month of films overburdened by dreams of Oscar its nice to anticipate a picture that has no other ambition but hard-boiled detective-story entertainment. Its also disappointing when the films modest pleasures are scuttled by more sizable frustrations and when a little movie with big talent behind it turns out to be suitable only for in-flight viewing. (You wont FIND Jack Reacher on TIMEs Top 10 Best Movies of 2012) In the sniper shooting an abundance of clues leads to a loner Iraqi veteran James Barr (Joseph Sikora) who looks ripe for the death penalty. His one demand to the police before convicts beat him into a coma is ""Get Jack Reacher."" No one in Pittsburgh knows how to contact Reacher -- he leaves only a ghosts shadow -- yet within days he shows up. Reachers mission is not to clear the suspect but to ensure his death. Years before on a Middle East tour of duty Barr had shot and killed four contractors but been freed on a political technicality; Reacher the military cop who nailed him promised Barr that if it happened again he would come back to exact justice. He tells this to Emerson (David Oyelowo) the detective who gathered the evidence against Barr to District Attorney Alex Rodin (Richard Jenkins) and to the D.A.s lawyer daughter Helen (Rosamund Pike) who has taken Barrs case. Reacher agrees to act as Helens investigator both to validate his opinion of the defendant and because... well if Barr really were the sniper thered be neither book nor movie. (READ Corlisss 1989 Tom Cruise cover story by subscribing to TIME) Though closer to five-six than to six-five Cruise adequately fills the Reacher silhouette. The three-decade leading man who turned 50 this summer wears his years well. He is still of sturdy physique which he irrelevantly displays to Pike and has quick reflexes needed for the three main action sequences. They dont match his scaling of the 160 stories of Dubais Burj Khalifa in Mission Impossible 4 but theyll do as a Cruise triathlon. Here they are a fight with five guys (""Remember you asked for this"" he tells the ringleader before beating the sap out of him); a frantic car chase through the City of Bridges (some sharp work by Cruise and his stunt drivers); and the climactic battle at a quarry where he and a craggy ex-Marine (Robert Duvall) try to take down the movies Comrade Big a wily survivor of Soviet gulags who is known as The Zec (Pantheon director Werner Herzog sporting an agate marble for his left eye and fingers gnawed down to the knuckles). A Cruise character that never smiles simply does not give value for money -- Reacher would be a snugger fit for some large glum actor an Arnold Schwarzenegger or Liam Neeson in his younger days --  but the star is not the problem with Jack Reacher. (READ Richard Schickels review of the Cruise-McQuarrie film Valkyrie) The culprit is McQuarrie whose Oscar-winning script for the 1995 The Usual Suspects stands out in his otherwise so-so resume like the Burj Khalifa on the flat Arabian Peninsula. Stripping the 496-page novel of three of its five prominent female characters while retaining a Child plot twist indebted to Agatha Christies The ABC Murders McQuarrie gets the gist of the story but not the juice. Many scenes have the airless tone of a first read-through; the car chase (done on foot in the novel) is a needless exercise sloppily choreographed; Pike and Oyelowo fine British actors both seem stranded and coarse of character in the drab mise-en-scene. Theres a moment when Reacher has his back turned as Helen enters a room and can identify her because she was ""breathing too sternly."" Pikes whole performance is like that naive and anxious. (READ Corlisss review of Christopher McQuarries The Usual Suspects) A strong director might have enlivened two of the starker scenes -- Reacher overwhelming two Keystone-klutz thugs in a bathroom and the fearsome Zec telling a minion he wont be killed if hell just bite off a finger -- but McQuarrie hasnt the skill or daring to make them work. (A kinder inference would be that he was inhibited by Cruises insistence on landing a PG-13 rating for the film.) Some movies like Tom Hoopers Les Miserables fail because of bad direction big ideas gone wrong. Jack Reacher suffers from a lack of direction as if McQuarrie had pushed the actors in front of the camera and hoped that the film would miraculously make itself. Maybe he relied too much on the artistry of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (The Black Stallion The Right Stuff The Patriot The Passion of the Christ) and by Joe Kraemers thumping score which during helicopter shots of the crime scene explodes like Gods farts over Pittsburgh. (READ Corlisss review of Hoopers Les Miserables) We found a few saving performances. Jai Courtney makes an excellent impression a blend of Javier Bardem and early Jeremy Renner as Charlie The Zecs chief marksman-henchman. Jenkins as the D.A. in tense conversation with Helen subtly segues from badgering the witness to playing the protective dad. James Martin Kelly is wonderful in a small role as Rob Farrior the father of one of the snipers victims. A beefy working-class guy whose paternal tenderness has been stripped raw Farrior at first seems weakened by grief; but when Helen Barrs attorney visits him he is stirred to a fury that sends her packing. It lasts only a minute or two but its a beautifully acted scene of a man made bleary by mourning who in an eyeblink realizes that a fathers atavistic duty is to lash out at the emissary of his daughters killer. Coincidentally Farrior stands in for those in Newtown and beyond rendered numb by tragedy and wondering why the news media or movies have to pick so diligently at this fresh wound. (READ James Poniewozik on the medias exploitation of the Sandy Hook children) Theres also one laugh-out-loud line of dialogue when Reacher faces down Charlie with the gaudy threat ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot"" as if Cruise were briefly channeling his Lestat character in Interview With the Vampire. Its almost up there with James Caans immortal warning -- ""I can promise you a day of reckoning that you will not live long enough to never forget"" -- in McQuarries directorial debut the 2000 The Way of the Gun. (READ Corlisss review of Christopher McQuarries The Way of the Gun) The blood-from-a-boot line is a keeper but it doesnt suit the heros brand of tight-lipped heroism. Even when the film is cool it manages to be wrong. Thats another stroke of bad luck in a movie whose worst misfortune was to stumble into the middle of anguished national debate about the kind of killer Jack Reacher means only as a plot device.

These include ""Be on your feet and ready."" ""Identify the ringleader."" ""Dont break the furniture."" Rule number nine is the most important ""Dont run head-on into Jack Reacher. Not when hes expecting it. Its like running into an oak tree.""As fans of Childs 17 (and counting) Reacher novels know the drifter hero is 6-foot-5 which means that to bring this oak of a man to life onscreen the comparatively diminutive Tom Cruise (5-foot-7) would have to overcompensate with some serious tough-guy glowering. That was the expectation anyway. Instead when surrounded on a dark Pittsburgh street by five fools who have been paid a hundred bucks each to beat him bloody Cruises Reacher gives a wry ""you-asked-for-it"" shrug then puts the five down. Effortlessly. Convincingly. Cruise is definitely too short for the gig but in this first fight he proves his tough-guy chops. Outraged Reacher readers can stand down.Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (co-writer of The Usual Suspects) Jack Reacher opens as a sniper is setting up in a car garage directly opposite PNC Park home of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In a sequence that calls to mind the cold heartless grace of a Brian De Palma (Blow Out Dressed to Kill) set piece we see what the killer sees and wince as the rifle scope glides left right and then left again as that killer chooses seemingly at random who will die. Six shots ring out; five humans fall.Film Details Jack Reacher RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time130 More Info James Barr (Joseph Sikora) a retired Army sniper is quickly arrested but wont talk except to scrawl three words on a sheet of paper ""Get Jack Reacher."" As the detective in charge (David Oyelowo) and the district attorney (Richard Jenkins) wonder aloud why Barr has asked for a former military policeman who has fallen off the grid Reacher walks through the D.A.s office door. This on-cue entrance is indicative of a jokey tone McQuarrie maintains throughout the film as if to let us know that neither he nor Cruise are taking this lone hero stuff too seriously.It turns out that Reacher despises Barr but he cant resist helping Barrs idealistic defense attorney Helen Rodin (Rosamund Pike aces). After retracing the killers steps Reacher begins having doubts about Barrs guilt and once those five thugs come to beat him senseless its clear that theres a conspiracy afoot.Just why the bad guys are doing what theyre doing remains a bit of a muddle at the end of Jack Reacher. Still logic is rarely the point in movies like this (and the novels that inspire them). Theres much to enjoy here a goofily funny hallway fight between Reacher and two thugs best described as ""Dumb"" and ""Way Dumber""; the unlikely sight of revered film director Werner Herzog (Rescue Dawn; Cave of Forgotten Dreams) portraying an evil villain who chewed off his own fingers in a Soviet Gulag. And theres the clear delight passing between Cruise and his Days of Thunder co-star Robert Duvall who ambles into the third act in time to keep McQuarries relatively light touch from giving way to Reachers grim screw-the-courts brutality.If none of that works for you then obsess over the joy master cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (The Black Stallion) must have taken in bouncing light off Rosamund Pikes resplendent blond hair. Should a beat-em-up action flick be this beautiful? Follow the light Jack; follow the light.

Inside Halseys Troubled Past Chaotic Present How Son of Sam Changed America Jack Reacher Credit Karen Ballard By Peter Travers December 18 2012 More News The Best Movies of 2012 All Stories >> You can join the bitch squad and complain that five-foot-seven Tom Cruise has no business playing Jack Reacher the six-five 250-pound bruiser of an ex-military cop who walks tall and carries a big grudge against authority in Lee Childs novels (17 to date). More News The Best Movies of 2012 All Stories >> Or you can let the physical stuff go and admit that Cruise is good in the role damn good. At 50 Cruise has a physical dexterity that makes you believe he can mix it up with five guys in a fight scene take his lumps and still win. Cruise also catches the mental dexterity that puts Reacher ahead of his enemies as he drifts around the country finding trouble. You should know that Lee Child the pseudonym for British author Jim Grant never wrote a book called Jack Reacher. The plot comes from One Shot Childs ninth Reacher novel. Its self-contained story makes it a solid place to start. A sniper fires into a crowd killing five people with six shots. Why? Dont expect spoilers. Ill say only that Reacher is called in by the number-one suspect James Barr (Joseph Sikora) a former Army sniper Reacher never liked. What Reacher does know is that a military sniper wouldnt miss a shot unless it was on purpose. And so the investigation begins. The skilled director Christopher McQuarrie who wrote The Usual Suspects and adapted Childs book has an irresistible feel for the criminal underbelly. There are many tasty characters. Perhaps too many. But its a kick to have German filmmaker Werner Herzog around as a depraved piece of work known as the Zec. Newcomers Jai Courtney and Alexia Fast also make strong impressions on the wrong side of the law. But this is Cruises show. And he nails it. The patented smile is gone replaced by a glower that makes Jack Reacher a dark and dazzling ride into a new kind of hell.

Which is fine when hes keeping it fairly light. But as Jack Reacher - the hero of Lee Childss hugely popular thriller series - hes called upon to growl grunt and gun guys down in cold blood. And its hard not to laugh. An ex-US Army drifter who uses his superhuman fighting skills and vast intellect to help the needy Reacher is a kind of a one-man A-Team. His mission is to investigate the case of James Mark Barr a military sniper accused of picking off five ordinary people in Pittsburgh. But although the case against Barr seems watertight Reacher has his suspicions and it all leads - rather wonderfully - to Werner Herzog in funny-coloured contact lenses. Its hard to tell in what spirit we should receive writer-director Christopher McQuarries film - Herzogs scenery-chewing turn and most of Cruises laughably macho dialogue suggest pastiche but an air of gritty post-Bush bleakness and some brutal bone-snapping violence make for an odd tonal balance. The result is an average action-heavy detective story which walks a fine line between the compelling and comical.

Firstly the casting of Cruise as Reacher is immediately flawed. Not only in height but hair colour build and charisma. Cruise is just playing Cruise...theres not differentiation between this character and Ethan Hunt for example. Just think of Hunt as a drifter. Secondly the chemistry between Cruise and Rosamund Pike is laughable. Shes pretty hammy too. She just seems to open her eyes wider if shes trying to look concerned. The villains are pretty lame and Werner Herzog sounds like hes doing an Arnie impression...ironic given thats how he really speaks The action scenes were ok if a bit vacant the plot twists were predictable and the typically brilliant Robert Duvall - who is always watchable - is simply playing for laughs in a role you feel is far more fleshed out in the novel. Im confused as to why they chose the 9th Reacher book to film as well. In my view the Reacher novels would by far suit an HBO series. Still far better than the other recent Cruise disaster that was Oblivion. That was atrocious. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 13 2013R MerFeaturedTotally miss-cast Ruined the whole movie. Reacher is Reacher and part of Reacher is his size. Are there no big physical actors anymore? Lee should have never allowed it.

The film did stay true to the book and was very well done with plenty of action - something which Tom Cruise is extremely good at.

Besides when the man kicked the door on the big screen it looked better. The size issue didnt matter except when he ""tackled"" a giant but Mr C did okay by me and the dialogue was close enough to Reacher too. Apparently the reading group at my library (all Reacher fans) didnt take too kindly to Mr C playing their hero - but then they probably didnt go see the movie and thats their loss.

I agree virtually word for word with Archgates review. It was much better than I expected and is well worth a visit to your local cinema to see it.

Solid four stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 26 2012ARCHGATEFeaturedVery entertaining and easy on the eye. Possibly Cruises best action performance played straight down the line in this 12A certificated film. The story has a book-like linear style in its story telling which holds the attention throughout. His height is not an issue if a 6ft 5 dude can take on 5 dudes - so can a pumped up 5ft 7 dude. There is a rattling good car chase a tasty reverse kick fight.... and a nod to more films to follow.

So Tom Cruise who is not has his work cut out for him in his mission to impress both those who already have strong notions about how Reacher ought to look and those just now meeting the freelance one-man justice league and trying to take his measure. That Cruise fails to make a case for Reachers allure though has less to do with physical dissonance than it does with the films inability -- stupefying inability really -- to otherwise make a case for the characters originality in a movie so choked with visual cliches and dreadfully moldy dialogue. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (who previously worked with Cruise on Valkyrie) Jack Reacher stumbles around looking for a unifying narrative tone while the star soldiers on offering up his generic action-hero stance of calm opaque concentration. (An obligatory shirtless shot of Cruise confirms that his famous discipline in all things physical and mental still pays off.) The story meanwhile is run-of-the-mill muscular pulp. While all evidence points to a former military sniper in the apparently random shooting of five victims JR follows his own instincts -- calmly opaquely except when hes a coldly violent fighting machine -- and draws his own conclusions. Along the way he crosses paths with a Russian mobster sinister enough to sound exactly like Werner Herzog maybe because Herzog plays said mobster with lip-smacking gusto and a display of tiny teeth. And Reacher works side by side with a Blond Lady DA -- probably as good a name for her as any since British beauty Rosamund Pike (An Education) is given a Jane Doe of a role to work with.

TWITTER Tom Cruise is in fine form as the mysterious tough guy from Lee Childs novels finally reaches the big screen. Jack Reacher is an old-fashioned type of guy -- he doesnt use a cell phone or credit cards he travels by bus -- and the first film adaptation of one of Lee Childs Reacher novels has a correspondingly gritty low-tech real-muscle appeal. Tom Cruise might not be the 6-foot-5 rock described in the books but he makes the title role fit him like a latex glove in a winning turn that could spawn a popular new franchise for the star if public reaction to Christopher McQuarries film is as strong as its fun quotient warrants. PHOTOS Hollywoods Private Jets From Oprah Winfrey to Tom Cruise Who Owns What The British television veteran Child wrote his first Reacher novel in 1997 and since then has cranked out 16 more of which One Shot the basis for Jack Reacher was the ninth. The central character an Army vet and military policeman who knows all there is to know about weapons and hand-to-hand combat possesses the same appeal as classic Western heroes -- hes a loner self-sufficient a man of few words who comes and goes without explanation -- mixed with a touch of Philip Marlowes tough determination to peel back layers of deception and official cant to arrive at a satisfying form of justice. He also is hard as nails physically as he proves in fight after fight. In short hes a great male fantasy figure. Happily Cruise plays him with no fuss in a direct pared-down way with little sense of amped-up intensity or vanity; he can even take a joke at his own expense as when hes stripped to the waist in a motel room and Rosamund Pike says ""Could you put your shirt on please?"" Jack Reacher then is all business taking a break from whatever he does with the rest of his time to help solve a case that initially looks open and shut. The disturbing opening -- which like much of the film is shot and cut with taut precision -- shows a sniper position himself in a parking garage across the water from Pittsburghs baseball stadium and methodically picks off what looks to be five random targets on the riverfront promenade. PHOTOS Holiday Stuffing Why Long Movies Hit the Box Office This Season Quickly apprehended the apparent shooter is seriously roughed up and mysteriously asks for Jack Reacher who then equally mysteriously appears as if from nowhere to begin assessing the situation. The other key players include Detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) who made the arrest; District Attorney Rodin (Richard Jenkins); and Helen Rodin (Pike) the hospitalized suspects savvy lawyer who just happens to be the DAs daughter a relationship fraught with personal and professional tensions. Reacher knew the accused from their Iraq War days and impressively analyzes why Helens client was a perfect candidate for going off the deep end and committing such a horrific crime. At the same time he suggests she learn everything she can about the victims which prompts her to think that Reacher whod been off the grid for two years before this might be a bit of a conspiracy freak. As it becomes evident however its normal for Reachers very focused mind to be two or three steps ahead of everyone elses. While the plot is not complex -- its simplicity itself compared to McQuarries labyrinthine classic The Usual Suspects -- it nonetheless provides the tasty satisfactions of sturdy mystery thrillers of yore in which you know things are not what they appear and youre happy to be led by a capable expert through a maze of obstacles and suspicious characters to a satisfying denouement. VIDEO Jack Reacher Trailer Tom Cruise Is Not a Hero But Werner Herzog Is the Villain Said suspicious characters begin to accumulate when five stupid guys challenge Reacher to a fight outside a bar after he allegedly has dissed their friend Sandy (Alexia Fast). Big mistake on their part; Reacher takes them down in a bone-crunching display of scary combat techniques. Its the first of several intense physical encounters in which Cruise puts on an impressive show of quite credible mano a mano skills which refreshingly are not edited in a flurry of cuts designed to obscure either an aging stars inadequacy or the participation of a stunt double. Another action sequence that delivers the goods and doesnt cheat is an extended nocturnal car chase through Pittsburgh streets that harks back to the propulsive realism of Bullitt and The French Connection days; its no coincidence that the car Reacher drives is a 1970 Chevy Chevelle. As it races through the citys shadowy canyons the set piece delivers a fine sense of real speed and is prolonged enough to achieve a sense of genuine occasion rather than seeming just an obligatory action interlude to offset the talk scenes. The actual unraveling of the plot might contain limited surprises but again McQuarrie provides satisfactions with the surprise casting of director Werner Herzog as a creepy bad guy introducing Robert Duvall as a late-appearing key character and setting his action climax at night in a visually arresting quarry that carries the connotations of both a wartime battlefield and an ancient combat arena. The writer-director whose behind-the-camera skills have jumped considerably since his debut on The Way of the Gun a dozen years ago delivers the narrative and the visuals with clarity dispatch and style aided greatly by Caleb Deschanels bracingly sharp cinematography Jim Bissells nuanced production design and on-the-mark editing by Kevin Stitt that never calls attention to itself and helps 130 minutes go by in what feels like less than two hours. At least in terms of his action-film portfolio Cruise is in top form here; if he feels like working really hard as a star and producer he could alternate big-budget Mission Impossible outings with less expensive Jack Reacher installments for a number of years with other projects slipped in between them. Other important castmembers are classy led by the ever-welcome Pike as the smart but conflicted lawyer and not-quite love interest Jenkins as her suspicious dad and Oyelowo as the lead investigator.

Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded and his fans likely wont appreciate the stretch. In the mold of Bob Lee Swagger Dirk Pitt and Alex Cross ""Jack Reacher"" is right at home among pulp-fiction tough guys Paramount has tried to turn into franchises -- this relatively generic attempt based on Lee Childs bestselling suspenser ""One Shot."" Reacher is a brawny action figure whose exploits would have been a good fit for the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone back in the day but feel less fun when delegated to a leading man like Tom Cruise. The star is too charismatic to play someone so cold-blooded and his fans likely wont appreciate the stretch. Best case a role like Reacher would give Cruise another chance to tap into his single-minded ""Collateral"" killer but as written he comes across as more of a weary boy scout snuffing much of the energy that makes him so appealing. Whereas the hyperkinetic actor looks best on the run Reacher is a slow-moving six-and-a-half-foot enforcer -- the kind of guy Cruise should be outwitting not playing. Living off the grid the mans a ""ghost"" an ex-military inspector whose appearance at the scene of any crime usually means someones in for a reckoning. As imagined by Child hes a deliberately mysterious character a drifter without a drivers license or any permanent possessions who walks into a Goodwill store buys a used leather jacket and donates his old duds on the way out. Reachers bigscreen debut opens with a public shooting a nasty bit of business depicted ""Dirty Harry""-style through the scope of the snipers rifle. The marksman fires six shots killing five leaving behind clues that quickly lead to the arrest of trigger-happy Army vet James Barr (Joseph Sikora) whom Reacher remembers from the service. Det. Emerson (David Oyelowo playing it savvy) nabs the suspect and the D.A. (Richard Jenkins) is ready to convict. The prosecutor never loses a case though his legal-eagle daughter Helen (Rosamund Pike) is convinced Dads methods have put innocent men on Death Row so she picks this seemingly impossible opportunity to go head-to-head with him in court by defending Barr. Enter Reacher ready to send her client straight to hell when Helen convinces him to assist her in the suspects defense. In a different kind of Cruise movie Reacher would take her breath away in a soft-focus sex scene. Here the star toys with those expectations appearing shirtless in the lawyers hotel room long enough to generate sexual tension then walking out before she can get the wrong idea. The only pleasure this man takes is in punishing bad guys and behind this particular scheme lurks a wonderfully evil Werner Herzog whose rare acting role more than justifies the price of admission for fans of the heavily accented director. Thats hardly the demo Paramount is aiming for however. Writer-director Christopher McQuarries challenge ultimately centers on finding ways to distinguish his mostly derivative script based on the kind of guilty-pleasure read one buys at the airport and leaves on the seat. The setup may be clunky and the character a cliche but the film looks terrific (courtesy of d.p. Caleb Deschanel) and somewhat redeems its silliness through action featuring several satisfying hand-to-hand altercations a tense car chase and a well-staged climactic shootout in a gravel quarry. Seeing as how Childs Reacher novels are composed mostly of terse sentences three to five words apiece McQuarrie follows suit with his adaptation delivering dialogue and story in sharp little jabs. Every so often McQuarries soundbite script gives Cruise a line he can really relish as when Reacher tells the real sniper ""You killed that girl to put me in a frame and I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot."" Thats the kind of movie ""Jack Reacher"" aspires to be but within the confines of its PG-13 rating such ruthlessness doesnt fly. ""You think Im a hero"" Cruise hisses as if to suggest otherwise and then the character proceeds to behave like one risking his life -- with the help of a welcome old acquaintance (Robert Duvall) -- to try to rescue the kidnapped Helen from an obvious trap. Considering Reachers ambivalence toward romance this unofficial ""Days of Thunder"" reunion brings a welcome chemistry to the last act. With an assist from second unit director Paul Jennings the pic goes out with a bang sending Reacher into a treacherous shooting match between two expert marksmen armed with only a knife. Its not a persona Cruise fans are likely to see again so for auds eager to see the star in badass mode this may be their one shot.
