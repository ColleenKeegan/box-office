The Switch (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Switch (PG-13) Get past a pile of contrivances and The Switch is surprisingly sweet. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/18/2010 Editor rating 2.5 You have to overlook a whole lot of guff in order to enjoy the slight but pleasurable entertainment of The Switch. You have to believe that a woman named Kassie who looks like Jennifer Aniston would have so much trouble finding a romantic partner in New York City that she decides to go the artificial-insemination route in order to have a child. You have to swallow the fact that her best friend Wally (Jason Bateman) who is obviously in love with her has never tried to kick things up a notch since they went out on a couple of dates and fell into a best-pals routine. And you have to try to ignore the implausibility of a drunken Wally accidentally destroying Kassies donor sperm and replacing it with his own then completely forgetting his actions until seven years later when Kassie returns to New York with her son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson). Get past the pile of contrivances though and The Switch is a surprisingly sweet tender story of a man paralyzed by unrequited love but motivated by parenthood to break free of his stasis. Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (Blades of Glory) and screenwriter Alan Loeb have jettisoned much of Jeffrey Eugenides original short story Baster primarily using the switcharoo as the basis of a crowd-pleasing soft-edged romantic comedy. The Switch heroically tests your patience because its the kind of movie in which you know every single thing that is going to happen five minutes into the story. But Bateman playing a slightly darker variation of his familiar comic persona injects a layer of genuine pathos into Wally -- his neuroses border on self-loathing -- and he delivers the laughs when the movie needs them such as during the big change-up scene tricky business cleverly handled by the filmmakers within the confines of a PG-13 rating. Bateman also makes a fine foil for the young Robinson whose portrayal of a sad moody 6-year-old is surprisingly odd and believable (``Do you ever get scared that you might have Parkinsons? the hypochondriac kid asks his equally paranoid dad). Aniston has a harder role -- Kassie is more sketch than fully realized character -- and the movie suffers whenever you stop to think about her behavior and its motivations. The Switch benefits greatly from comic supporting turns by Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis as the leads respective best friends. But the movie ultimately is Batemans show to carry and he manages well even though it is in dire need of a few plot wrinkles or twists -- something to give the awfully slight picture a little more weight.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Switch amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Lottery Ticket Alpha and Omega >> The Switch Sorry tabloid readers. At no time in Josh Gordon and Will Specks insemination comedy does Jennifer ""Womb Watch"" Aniston growl ""Take that Brad."" Though the sperm donor the single mom-to-be picks out makes Tyler Durden look like yesterdays news--Patrick Wilson is golden and buff as an Oscar and hes both a rock climber and a gender studies professor--Wilsons COD DNA is a slap to the groin for Anistons best friend Jason Bateman a whiny selfish hypochondriac whos stunned--stunned--that she doesnt want his genes. And oddly Allan Loebs script (based on the short story by The Virgin Suicides author Jeffrey Eugenides) is Batemans tale the inner struggle of a coward who knows hes not good enough for the woman he loves. Hes not. Which makes The Switch an inverted romantic comedy where the lead probably shouldnt wind up with his amour--and besides after a drunken encounter with Wilsons sperm cup hes already implanted her with his seed. The resulting child played by six-year-old Thomas Robinson has all of his pops worst traits and the physical comedy between the pair is enough to charm the ovaries. Bateman is unmoved--if hes looking into a mirror he doesnt like what he sees. But he nails his characters slow transformation from egotist to uncle to would-be daddy and once his heart starts beating wed forgive him anything for a happy ending.

Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston in The Switch. Macall Polay In this film publicity image released by Miramax Films Jason Bateman left and Jennifer Aniston are shown in a scene from ""The Switch."" (AP Photo/Miramax Films-Disney Macall Polay) A formulaic flick like ""The Switch"" can be saved by good casting. Starring say Jennifer Lopez and Jason Priestley the creaky premise of best friends hatching a baby would groan under its own weight. Starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman ""The Switch"" is watchable. But anything more than that is not in its DNA.In this cloned cousin of ""When Harry Met Sally"" New Yorkers Kassie (Aniston) and Wally (Bateman) are longtime best friends who complain about their love lives to each other and to their respective same-sex sidekicks (Juliette Lewis and Jeff Goldblum).Still childless at 40 Kassie is looking for a suitable sperm donor. Instead of enlisting Wally which she says would complicate their friendship she hires Roland (Patrick Wilson) a handsome happily married feminist-literature professor. But at a party to celebrate the impending insemination ritual drunken Wally messes up the specimen jar substitutes his own seed -- and forgets about it for the next seven years while Kassie raises her new son in her Minnesota hometown.When Kassie returns to a job in New York Wally notices that he and precocious young Sebastian (scene-stealer Thomas Robinson) look alike and share a similar hypochondria. He realizes that hes the father just as Kassie is canoodling with newly divorced Roland. This strategically bred romantic comedy delivers a litter of cliches -- the interrupted confession the public proposal the precocious kid who knows the scientific names of his neuroses -- yet it induces a few oohs and aahs. Aniston and Bateman tone down their trademark spunk and sarcasm respectively and at least one of the characters grows into a likable facsimile of a human.There arent enough surprises to justify the title but ""The Switch"" produces sufficient light for a late-summer diversion.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Switch"" begins with the sort of promise that might as well be taken as a warning. A narrator riffs on timing in particular romantic timing. There are very few instances of true synchronicity he muses. Most of us make our way to each other by a series of odd collisions and tender compromises. Its a nicely glum and self-aware preamble to arguably one of the most beleaguered genres the romantic comedy. The voice -- ruminating as images of affection and quiet alienation New York-style play across the screen -- belongs to Wally portrayed by Jason Bateman who so often has his nimble way with dialogue. Alas Wallys observations about timing also provide a key to something bedeviling ""The Switch."" The comedy itself suffers from awkward scheduling. Though this isnt its only wrinkle. Jennifer Aniston portrays Kassie. Her biological clock is ticking but as she reports over a meal with best friend Wally her ""cervical mucous"" is still good. (The film is rated PG-13 so this is about as risque as it gets not counting the moment when the maneuver of the title takes place.) Though single and without immediate prospects for a husband Kassie has a chance to become pregnant with donor sperm. Unbeknownst to all the deposit in question is not that of Grecian-coin handsome Roland (Patrick Wilson) but of ""only friends"" Wally. Kassie gets pregnant and moves away. She returns seven years later with a very introspective son named Sebastian (Thomas Robinson). Does any of this sound familiar? Perhaps because 2010 is turned into the year of the donor tale. Although ""The Switch"" has some charming moments especially between Wally and Sebastian the movie suffers in comparison with this summers funnier and braver indie ""The Kids Are All Right."" And when Wally asks Kassie before she does the deed with the seed ""What if you meet someone tomorrow?"" its hard not to shout back at the screen ""Well then shed be in a romantic comedy called ""The Back-up Plan"" starring a different Jennifer -- Lopez. (That Jen too is an appealing star having a dickens of a time finding spot-on material for her talents.) The hook of ""The Switch"" is of course when will the switcheroo be revealed and will it wreck or unite? Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck give short shrift to the relationships. For instance its hard to trust the roots of Wally and Kassies friendship. Their first scene suggests it may have had something to do with sorry taste in sweaters. The directing duos last feature was the ultra silly ""Blades of Glory."" Screenwriter Allan Loeb takes off from a short story by Jeffrey Eugenides called ""Baster."" Loeb penned the upcoming ""Wall Street"" movie and the melodrama ""Things We Lost in the Fire."" In other words there appears to be a clash of sensibilities at work here. Even so Bateman does an able job shouldering the films emotional burdens; Wally is melancholy and aware. Though the film undertakes a thoroughly modern premise Aniston is confined by script and direction to a more traditional romantic-comedy cage. Underscoring this overly familiar genre feel is Juliette Lewis who arrives as she so often does these days like a boozy aunt into a quiet room. If Debbie (Lewis) has Kassies back Wally seeks consul from equities business partner Leonard. Jeff Goldblum initially plays Leonard as the nattering demon on Wallys shoulder before taking his character to interestingly gentle places. TV news anchor Diane Sawyer has an amusingly tart cameo -- one husband Mike Nichols will either nod in agreement with or wince at or perhaps both.

Comments The Switch Recommended Rated PG-13  101 minutes  2010 When a single 40-year-old career woman tells her best friend that shes decided to have a child by artificial insemination he tries to dissuade her for various reasons although the most important one--that hes actually in love with her--remains unspoken. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman costar and while Aniston has established herself as a gifted comedian its Bateman whos especially memorable as a sweater-vest-attired neurotic sleepwalking through his job as a financial analyst. Featuring sharp dialogue by screenwriter Allen Loeb (adapted from Jeffrey Eugenidess short story ""The Baster"") rife with acid quips this New York-based comedy directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck distinguishes itself with three-dimensional characters and an engaging storyline.

Starring Jennifer Aniston Jason Bateman Juliette Lewis Patrick Wilson Jeff Goldblum Caroline Dhavernas Todd Louiso Scott Elrod Bryce Robinson Thomas Robinson Director Josh Gordon Will Speck Release Opened Aug 20 2010  Editorial Review Surprise A special deliveryBy Ann HornadayFriday August 20 2010The good news about ""The Switch"" is that it lives up to its title. Baiting customers with an ad campaign that makes it look like yet another piece of pregnancy-themed Hollywood product this disarmingly winning comedy instead turns into a warm quirkily observant film strengthened by some appealing performances and a low-key easygoing vibe. Less reminiscent of the dreadful comedy ""The Back-Up Plan"" than 2002s lovely ""About a Boy"" this adaptation of a Jeffrey Eugenides story takes viewers down a path that while by no means of least resistance possesses a gratifying share of surprises. The biggest among them is focus. ""The Switch"" stars Jennifer Aniston as 40-year-old Kassie a single woman who decides to conceive a child by way of a sperm donor. Her best friend Wally (Jason Bateman) looks on disapprovingly offering little by way of moral support and much by way of neurotic self-involved commentary. (Its a measure of how close they are that within the first few minutes of ""The Switch"" theyre talking about his scrotum and her cervical mucus.) But viewers expecting yet another film about baby-crazed women and their biological clocks will be happy to discover that ""The Switch"" takes Kassies choice in stride and instead directs most of its attention to Wally who after Kassie has her baby and years pass spends most of the movie puzzling his way through intimacy commitment and his nascent rapport with Kassies son Sebastian. That Milk Dud-eyed charmer is played by the young Thomas Robinson whose scenes with Bateman define the high points of ""The Switch."" Its difficult to describe how funny it is to see a 6-year-old complain of insomnia or alternatively how poignant to watch him construct a mythical extended family from a collection of ersatz picture-frame photos. Suffice it to say that thanks to Robinsons soulful performance and his obvious chemistry with Bateman what could have been a maudlin or saccharine enterprise rings eccentrically true. Its a tribute to directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (""Blades of Glory"") working from a script by Allan Loeb that an otherwise unsavory delousing scene unfolds with unexpected sweetness and charm. Aniston her blue eyes even sharper than usual gracefully cedes center stage to her male co-stars and supporting players Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis provide their own doses of idiosyncratic comic relief as Wallys addled partner and Kassies blowsy best girlfriend. But ""The Switch"" to its credit really is about a boy who with the help of a sensitive sad-eyed kid stands a chance of becoming a man.Contains mature thematic content sexual material including dialogue some nudity drug use and profanity.

Despite an impressive literary pedigree a fitfully amusing ""The Switch"" -- Hollywoods third artificial-insemination comedy of the year -- ranks somewhere between the barely watchable ""The Back-Up Plan"" and the good but wildly overrated ""The Kids Are All Right."" The hapless Jennifer Aniston may have top billing here but the story revolves around a character played by Jason Bateman an ace supporting actor who cant quite carry a movie -- as the handful of people who saw ""Extract"" a year ago can attest. Bateman plays the neurotic Wally the best friend of Anistons Kassie. Once romantically involved Wallys still carrying a torch for his gorgeous long-ago girlfriend. PHOTOS THE SWITCH FILMING IN NEW YORK PHOTOS JENNIFER ANISTONS LEADING MEN VIDEO SHOOTING BLANKS PHOTOS JENNIFER ANISTON But being mysteriously single Kassie has decided to get pregnant using sperm donated by Roland (Patrick Wilson) a married man. As in the New Yorker short story by Jeffrey Eugenides on which the movie is loosely based the deed is performed at a party where Wally having had a few too many drinks accidentally spills Rolands seed and has to make a quick substitution. Eugenides story ends with the birth of Wally and Kassies son but ""The Switch"" is unfortunately just getting started. After giving birth Kassie decamps to Minnesota and eventually back to New York with 6-year-old Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) in tow. I want to pause here to note that neither Wally nor Kassie look a day older and more importantly the world around them does not appear to have changed a whit during these six financially parlous years proceeding the ""present day."" Though long out of work Kassie instantly lands a plum job in network television. Wally has somehow held onto his position in the financial sector despite a tendency to show up drunk at his boss apartment at 2 oclock in the morning. What follows is basically ""About a Boy"" for dummies as Wally who has forgotten about the childs drunken origin bonds with Sebastian. But Wally gradually remembers after noticing the kid shares hypochondria and other obsessive traits with him. This may be the first movie to feature a head-lice montage. Kassie is preoccupied with throwing herself at the newly available Roland (whom she was not previously interested in). Even for a comedy Kassies relative lack of interest in her sons activities is shocking and her reaction when she finally learns about the ruse is surprisingly muted. Shes less a flesh-and-blood character than a plot device and Anistons utter lack of chemistry (comic or otherwise) with Bateman doesnt help matters. Perhaps Josh Gordon and Will Speck the auteurs behind ""Blades of Glory"" werent the ideal choice of directors for this comedy which tries to be more than a sitcom but keeps falling back on cheap laughs. They do get an inspired performance from young Robinson as the unfortunate child. And from the little-seen Jeff Goldblum who steals every scene hes in as Wallys non sequitur-spouting boss/wingman. Aside from those two ""The Switch"" is pretty much stillborn. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jennifer Aniston slammed for using R word in interview ...

Joe Neumaier Friday August 20 2010 400 AM Title The Switch Jason Bateman has no business hijacking ""The Switch"" and turning a middling Jennifer Aniston rom-com into an exploration of delayed adulthood. But the former ""Arrested Development"" star -- whos come through with some great supporting performances over the last several years -- is anything but a layabout.Here though hes swimming against the tide. Because as hard as Bateman tries to save ""The Switch"" -- which sounds like a mystical body-changing comedy but is not -- the reality is that the DNA this movie is working from is hackneyed bland and dopey with a dollop of outre. Its Judd Apatow lite Farrelly brothers special blend. Just call it ""When Harry Met Sally and Her Ovum.""Bateman plays Wally a New Yorker in a permanent funk which is how he likes it. His grumpy outlook and socially clumsy ways annoy everyone but Kassie (Aniston) his best pal and once a potential girlfriend. Wally still pines for what could have been so when Kassie decides she wants to use in-vitro to get pregnant (in one of those irritating movie moments where a single woman announces to her slack-jawed friends ""Im going to have a baby"") hes heartbroken.Kassie throws a party where the good-looking donor Roland (Patrick Wilson) puts his ""contribution"" -- this is a movie hung up on euphemisms -- in a cup in the bathroom. But Wally drunkenly spills the crucial ingredient down the sink so he replaces it with his own.He conveniently forgets this and after seven years away Kassie and her son move back to New York. Guess who looks and acts exactly like Wally? Someones in for some bonding -- not to mention a reason finally for Kassie to love him.The time frame for ""The Switch"" is like notes from Nora Ephrons shopping list Wally and Kassie dated 13 years ago but we first see them six years later then flash-forward seven years and ... Does anyone have a calculator? And there really has to be a moratorium on quirky sidekicks Juliette Lewis is so squawky and deadly as Kassies co-worker that she almost derails things from her first scene. (Jeff Goldblum at least does his best as Wallys boss and confidant.)Aniston as always is Our Gen-X Jen stand-in for a million sassy city dwellers who see themselves reflected in her hair styles. She does her usual pursed-lip scolding face and not much else. (What happened to the actress who lit up ""Office Space"" and ""The Good Girl""?)So Bateman steps in perhaps realizing that this adaptation of a Jeffrey Eugenides short story needs more. Bateman turns Wally from a jumble of tics into a guy who sees in his son the problems he faced and works to change the future by changing himself. His performance is fun. Too bad ""The Switch"" is not. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Switch movie review Jennifer Aniston stars in cliched donor-daddy comedy |       NJ.com comments The Switch movie review Jennifer Aniston stars in cliched donor-daddy comedy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 20 2010 at 750 AM updated August 20 2010 at 356 PM View/Post Comments Baster ProductionsJason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston play friends who are perfect for each other but too oblivious to recognize it in ""Switch."" ""The Switch"" movie review If youve been watching the cable yakkers lately you know that the new Jennifer Aniston film ""The Switch"" -- the second donor-daddy comedy this summer -- has come under fire for supposedly endorsing the single-parent-by-choice lifestyle. Which is dangerous because you know Aniston is such a role model for our youth. The controversy all sounds a little bit like ""Murphy Brown 2.0"" to me. But actually thats not the only familiar thing about ""The Switch."" The truly dusty cliche it drags out again is the cute couple who dont you know think-of-each-other-like-that. Until of course they do. There are a lot of movie standbys I dont care for (the cut-to-pet-for-a-reaction-shot is another one -- and thats here too) but the I-never-saw-you-this-way-before one always felt awfully contrived. (The reason this guy is a non-starter? He wears ugly sweaters. Next) And that gimmick is all this movie has. Well not quite all. It has Jason Bateman as the guy in those reprehensible woolens and he does an honest vulnerable job as a perfectly decent guy (who does one fairly unbelievable thing). It also has young Thomas Robinson as the eventual Aniston progeny who is cute in an overwritten role. Movie Review The Switch (PG-13) Miramax (100 min.) Directed by Josh Gordon Will Speck. With Jennifer Aniston Jason Bateman. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual references brief nudity and drug and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS ""Overwritten"" is not a problem that the other characters share. Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis have what are usually the best parts in a romantic comedy - the main characters confidantes -- but neither of them gets any good lines. That they get laughs at all - and theyre the only two who do -- is a tribute to their hard work. Aniston making a small recovery from the horrendous ""The Bounty Hunter"" looks pert and pretty (she may be the best-groomed woman in Hollywood -- I picture flights of stylists hovering around her like cartoon bluebirds each one armed with a hot comb and a pumice stone). But who is she playing besides a desperate-to-get-pregnant woman? Were told shes from Minnesota. Great. Were told she has a big job on TV (and see her once backstage at ""The Charlie Rose Show"" gossiping with a friend). But what does she really do? Whats her family like? What are her fears? What are her passions? Who knows? She wants a baby. Her clock is ticking. What else do you need to know? Nothing I guess because obviously thats the point at which the filmmakers stopped thinking about her. Shes not a character shes a one-note plot device. (The co-directors last made the ""Cavemen"" TV series and maybe it was a good fit.) Bateman is good enough -- and has been good enough for long enough -- that you keep wishing hed get his own movie to drive. And Goldblum and Lewis do so much heavy lifting with such little support you start to worry that theyre going to throw their backs out. But ""destructive""? Contributing to our nations moral decline? Dont flatter it. ""The Switch"" is about as dangerous as an old Ralph Bellamy movie. And not quite as much fun.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 20 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Switch Directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck Written by Allan Loeb Starring Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston Classification NA Oftentimes new technology makes for old plots. Consider the case of able-bodied semen which thanks to medical science can now be deposited in a bottle and donated to any female pregnant with reproductive desires. And what have the movies done with this modern miracle? Two things mainly. The first is tritely comic Yes the Scene the recurring one where our embarrassed seed-spiller gets locked in an antiseptic room stocked with the sort of light reading designed to promote heavy breathing. The second is tritely dramatic a reprise of the hoariest plot device in the book confused parentage the ol whos-your-daddy routine. No wonder the result looks fresh but smells stale so many state-of-the-art test tubes wrapped in a Dickensian yarn. With that in mind welcome to The Switch another in a recent line of romcoms eager to get us laughing all the way to the sperm bank and then to the infant dividends beyond. This one very loosely based on a Jeffrey Eugenides story spends the first act laboriously telegraphing its premise. The place is Manhattan seven years ago where we meet that most familiar and tedious of cinematic couples - the ""best friends"" who take the entire damn movie to figure out they love each other. Wally (Jason Bateman) is a successful financier with a neurotic streak. Nothing too off-putting of course just mildly yet cutely depressive and a bit of a hypochondriac. Kassie is easier to sum up Shes Jennifer Aniston looking more mature these days but not acting it. Shes still got those sitcom mannerisms wedded in this case to a sitcom conceit ""Im in the market for some semen."" Right quick a marketer pops up in the handsome form of Roland (Patrick Wilson) gainfully employed and happily married yet apparently eager to offer his helping hand. Cue the Scene with a slight difference this time. Everyone gathers for an ""insemination party"" - in an apartment with a bathroom containing the strategically placed bottle into which the hunky Roland makes the deposit followed by a drunken Wally who makes ""the switch."" And then he passes out his deed conveniently forgotten. Flash forward to the present when after moving to the Midwest to give birth and raise her son Kassie returns to New York keen to introduce little Sebastian to her best friend. Well darned if the lad isnt a chip off Wallys neurotic block - same cutesy streak of depression same hypochondriacal tendencies even the same command of the Queens English. Given to planetary concerns the boy lectures ""Nature is in crisis and theres only one mammal to blame."" Okay I know that precociousness is the rule for screen tykes but thats quite a mouthful for any six-year-old mammal. The wonder here is that Bateman and the child actor spark off each other quite delightfully. For a few precious scenes when father and son are alone the movie is actually amusing even touching. The rest of the time its content to stall looking for a credible impediment to romance and not finding it in the reappearance of Roland divorced now but as annoyingly upbeat as ever. Worse the stalling comes to a dead stop when the co-directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck winch in this leaden montage A lovers quarrel followed by a solitary walk in the rain punctuated by a sappy ballad lumbering over the soundtrack. It took two of them to come up with that? Happily not everything unfolds at a contrived crawl. Indeed the contrived crisis the contrived resolution and the contrived ending all zip by in a New York minute. But did I mention Sebastians obsessive hobby? He collects mass-market picture frames with their stock photos generic shots of generic people still inside - hey the kids got all the makings of a Hollywood producer.

"Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman almost save The Switch. Slate Sign In Sign Up Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman almost save The Switch. Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman almost save The Switch. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 19 2010 606 PM The Switch Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman almost save this romantic comedy. By Dana Stevens Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman in The Switch An ineluctable cloud of melancholy hangs over The Switch (Miramax) directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck from a New Yorker short story by Jeffrey Eugenides. This isnt because the story is particularly sad--in fact the rough edges of the original story (the social satire the presence of abortion as a plot element) have all been smoothed away. No the sadness comes from the audiences sense that inside this slick conventional romantic comedy theres a tender scruffy little movie struggling to get out. When you laugh at a line in The Switch the laughter contains an element of surprise Wow I cant believe a character in this movie said something funny. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Ultimately The Switch cant escape the constraints of its own formula Its a Hollywood rom-com through and through complete with quirky best friends third-act musical montages and reaction shots from dogs. But that weird little spark of life keeps struggling to make its presence known right up to the bitter (happy) end. Much of the spark derives from the performances of the two leads both deft comedians who deserve better. Jason Bateman as the repressed Wall Street analyst Wally does something thats unusual for a male romantic lead He refuses to ingratiate himself either to his potential romantic partner or to us. Throughout the film Wally remains a hypochondriac who is standoffish and emotionally remote. Hes funny and likable yes--after all this is Jason Bateman were talking about--but hes also a real misanthrope with issues that falling in love seems unlikely to fix. As Kassie Wallys longtime best friend and sort-of long-ago girlfriend Jennifer Aniston gets a less complex role. (The idea of a not-nice female lead is still a bridge too far for Hollywood romantic comedy.) But Anistons ability to project both vulnerability and pluck combined with what we know (or think we know) about her offscreen life as a perpetual singleton makes Kassie a believably conflicted character. Advertisement A successful TV producer in her late 30s Kassie has made up her mind to get pregnant on her own. She coolly sizes up potential sperm donors on Craigslist and on the street oblivious to the ""What am I chopped liver?"" expression on Wallys lovelorn face. After choosing her man a wholesome outdoorsy jock named Roland (Patrick Wilson) Kassie throws herself an ""insemination party"" (an event I pray never takes place outside of high-concept comedies). Wally gets so drunk--realistically depressingly un-cutely drunk--that he winds up in Kassies bathroom replacing Rolands sperm sample with one of his own. (This scene steers as clear of coarse grossout comedy as a scene involving masturbation and sperm-switching could reasonably be expected to do.) The next morning thanks both to his overconsumption of alcohol and his skill at repressing important truths Wally awakes with a whopping hangover but no memory of the sample-switch incident. Kassie gets pregnant moves to the Midwest to raise her son and comes back to New York seven years later with a kid in tow (the winning Thomas Robinson) whos a solemn-faced ringer for his neurotic bio-dad. Gradually in conversation with his manic officemate (Jeff Goldblum) Wally begins to recollect what happened the night of that fateful bender. Should he tell Kassie the truth and try against all odds to win her trust again? Even if she is starting to fall for the kayak-toting lug she believes is her sons real father? All this sounds so contrived and hoop-jumping and for long stretches especially when a gratuitous Bateman voiceover kicks in it is. But there are unexpected flashes of wit throughout especially in the scenes where Wally and the little boy cautiously begin to bond ""Hows school?"" ""Why?"" ""Because youre a kid and theres nothing else to talk about."" The development of Aniston and Batemans romance isnt altogether believable--we see his secret longing for her but never hers for him. But the development of the father-son relationship is handled with a refreshing lack of sentimentality. If nothing else The Switch will take the prize for 2010s tenderest scene involving a delousing. Batemans understated performance wrings laughs out of the smallest gestures When he pretends to nod off for a moment during Anistons encomium to her beau its funnier than any scripted comeback could have been. And Goldblum turns every one of his reasonably funny lines (from a screenplay by Allan Loeb) into a perfectly aimed comic dart. Whenever he comes onscreen the audience snaps to attention. Whatever the prescription is for what ails contemporary romantic comedy--a sickness of which The Switch is disappointingly more symptom than cure--it should involve at least a tincture of Jeff Goldblum.

Starring Jennifer Aniston Jason Bateman and Thomas Robinson. Directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jennifer Aniston brings certain things to movies A relaxed yet spontaneous comic ability. An attentiveness to the other actors that is rare in its focus. A quality of stumbling humanity that is making a nice transition from youth to middle age backed by another quality - the glowing sanity of someone old enough to know her place in the universe and the importance of other people. So when she announces in the opening minutes of ""The Switch"" that she has decided to have a baby despite having no man in her life it doesnt sound like the foundational gimmick in a romantic comedy. It sounds like the considered decision of a 40-year-old woman who despite a certain surface chipperness has thought long and hard about the promises and limits of life. Moreover through Aniston we can also see past her to the vast numbers of women in the real world making the same judgments and coming to the same conclusions. In the end ""The Switch"" is not worthy of the human qualities that Aniston brings - her movies rarely are. Nor is it really worthy of Jason Bateman who goes through the movie as a repressed guy struggling with emotions he can neither articulate nor contain. But lets not dismiss it outright. Instead think of ""The Switch"" as a picnic. Aniston and Bateman each bring a rare Bordeaux and the writers bring Spam on white bread. You can skip the picnic or show up and have a glass of wine. Bateman who gets the most face time here starts out the film as a pessimistic soul made yet more grumpy by his being locked into platonic mode with his best friend Kassie (Aniston). Hes so in denial about his feelings that he doesnt quite admit to himself that hes in love with her but when she announces her plans to find a sperm donor it knocks him completely off balance. Actually in its first minutes ""The Switch"" which is based on a Jeffrey Eugenides short story is smart and observant. With a modern bravado that we will all recognize Kassie throws herself an insemination party with all her friends and acquaintances and then turns embarrassed thinking that she has done something pathetic. Patrick Wilson plays the sperm donor. Hes tall and athletic has nice white teeth and an upbeat disposition but an IQ test should have eliminated him from consideration. Throughout Bateman conveys well the emotional torment of a guy too locked up inside to go after what he wants. As Kassies young son Thomas Robinson doesnt give us the usual movie brat but an odd sweet kid who is plugged in to the pain of the universe. As for Aniston she hovers over the movie even when shes not onscreen as the promise of middle-age salvation. Thats what Aniston has been doing in her recent movies saving the lives of 40-year-old men Aaron Eckhart in ""Love Happens"" Steve Zahn in ""Management"" ... But the movies flaw is impossible to ignore turning on the most tired of romantic comedy conventions Someone knows something and all that person has to do is say it and the movie is over and everythings great. But he doesnt say it. And of course he would say it. So the movie goes on and on instead of ending and the more viewers have believed in the characters and their world the more frustrated they become. Still amid the slog of nonsense there are moments that are gems. Heres one. Aniston sits on a sofa with Bateman and suddenly realizes she has amorous feelings for him. But its not mere lust or affection. She is also in the grip of a maternal feeling which she is sensing yet not quite registering. Aniston does all this with no words in the script. Just a look. Or heres another one. In the film Bateman becomes close to Anistons son and every time hes with him we see the boy in Batemans face. He doesnt act like a child but we see the child inside him. Thats lovely. So consider seeing this one for the actors and just know what youre getting into. -- Advisory Sex talk.

"The Switch is a real turn-off - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs The Switch is a real turn-off Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Macall Polay Miramax Films/Disney via AP Mom goes it alone Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) chose to have her son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) by artificial insemination. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Switch   (out of four) Stars Jennifer Aniston Jason Bateman Thomas Robinson Patrick Wilson Jeff GoldblumDirectors Josh Gordon and Will SpeckDistributor Miramax PicturesRating PG-13 for mature thematic content sexual material including dialogue some nudity drug use and languageRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The characters in The Switch seem to live in an alternate reality as if a switch was pulled to plunge them into a place like Earth but not quite. To clarify this is a romantic comedy not a sci-fi adventure tale. But the actions choices and general behavior of the characters are oddly removed from what goes in the real world. For starters Jennifer Aniston plays Kassie a single New York City TV producer who opts to have a baby by artificial insemination. She has halfheartedly given up on finding a husband but her choice to become a mother is made with about as much consideration as buying a sofa. Didnt Jennifer Lopez play essentially the same role this year in The Back-Up Plan? Only in the movies are glamorous 40ish single women leaping into single parenthood via sperm donation. VIDEO See if The Switch works for you Aniston returns to tired form here. She seems drawn to forgettable roles in such generic romantic comedies as Love Happens and Hes Just Not That Into You. Shes better playing against type in such offbeat films as The Good Girl (2002) and Friends With Money (2006) but seems intent on stamping out rom-com parts in cookie-cutter fashion. Kassie throws an insemination party and invites Roland the handsome donor (Patrick Wilson) to gather and deliver his donation. Who does that? Amid this craziness is Kassies best friend Wally (Jason Bateman) a mildly neurotic stockbroker depicted as an ""undateable"" sad sack. The fact that hes handsome smart funny kind and a true friend to Kassie is immaterial. Kassie rejects his offer to be her sperm donor because hes too close of a friend. Who are these people? Bateman essentially carries the film his charm and intelligence intact throughout the predictable fluff. The story is adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides Baster. As directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon the duo responsible for Blades of Glory its a bastardized reworking that renders Anistons part particularly colorless. Things liven up in the second half of the film. Moving home to Minnesota Kassie returns with sad-eyed 6-year-old Sebastian (a wonderful Thomas Robinson). Bateman and Robinson are adorable together exhibiting far more convincing chemistry than either of them does with Aniston. The movies most sweetly original and amusing sequence involves Wally helping rid Sebastian of head lice. Their scenes together are the only reason to see the movie. Sometimes movies mimic real life revealing hidden truths about the human condition. This is not one of those times.

"Movie review The Switch - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-SpermMovie review The SwitchJennifer Aniston and Jason Batemans characters are best buddies until she decides to become a single mom by choice but enough about her. The story is really about him and its worth watching him grow up.August 20 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Switch"" the very dry romantic comedy starring Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman is what you might call a Bate-and-switch affair. More his journey than hers more satire than slapstick the film is that rare example of rom-com about men which turns out to be a nice switch indeed. Bateman is Wally one of those smart neurotics forever bemoaning his half-empty glass. Hes a Wall Street whiz which in this day and age is reason enough for pessimism and paranoia except that Wallys business is booming and his best friend is Anistons Kassie a beautiful network exec/girl next-door type (its a very good neighborhood). Everythings swell until Kassie decides shes going solo on the baby front and Wally doesnt even make the sperm donor short list. Bad feelings ensue and a friendship ""timeout"" soon follows leaving Wallys business partner and buddy Jeff Goldblum asking ""What are you 6?"" Thats pretty much the question that co-directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (""Blades of Glory"") spend most of their time mulling with Bateman taking the ""Arrested Development"" ethos which positioned him as Americas favorite rational thinker (party pooper?) to new extremes. Paralyzed by the idea of commitment Wally undermines all romance and protects his soft emotional underbelly with satirical barbs so sharp he should come with a warning label as one blind date learns when he imagines a future for them that involves New Jersey suburbs and hating each other. Given the origin of ""The Switch"" a short story called ""Baster"" by Jeffrey Eugenides author of ""Middlesex"" and a master at mental contortions and relationship confusions Wallys emotional slings and arrows cause just as much damage to him as anyone around him. And screenwriter Allan Loeb stays true to that same dysfunctional spirit. But since this is also about romantic possibilities Kassie and Wally reconnect at her insemination party. Unfortunately Roland ( Patrick Wilson) also enters the picture as the perfect donor from the pecs to the Ivy-League pedigree and the perfect nemesis for Wally. Complications ensue as they must. Somewhere between the anti-anxiety pills and the free-flowing alcohol that night Wally switches the ""ingredients"" a fact that gets lost in his drug-induced haze. Kassie gets pregnant and decamps to Michigan leaving Wally to over-think things for the next seven years and a few too many scenes until a network job brings her and 6-year-old Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) back into town and Wallys life. Now heres where it gets interesting because Wally finally has to figure out how to grow up which is what the rest of the movie is concerned with. Between Bateman the filmmakers the smart script and the talented and adorably soulful Robinson we get a carefully calibrated comic look at male maturation. Sebastians chip-off-the-old-block angst is just whats needed to crush Wallys commitment issues and Robinson does an excellent job of it. Turning a romantic leading man into a character so prickly hes hard to like much less fall in love with is a calculated risk. Though it doesnt always gel it does pay off in unexpected ways. By making Batemans existential crisis central it takes some of the pressure off Aniston and allows her to slip into the sort of character-driven smaller-scale relationship ensemble work that fits her best. Here she moves through the film effortlessly adjusting Kassies emotional colors slipping into friend girlfriend and mommy mode as needed reminding us just how good she was at sharing center stage in ""Friends."" (It also makes it easier to forget about the spring fiasco of ""The Bounty Hunter"" and last years ""Love Happens."") Since Anistons strength is in being likable rather than sexy the movie is less romance in the kissy-moony-hopelessly devoted sense than comedy. In that Bateman proves a good foil whether locked in that ""will they or wont they?"" tango with Kassie jockeying for position with Roland or getting advice from Goldblums Leonard who seems as amused as I was that he is the voice of reason in that guy-always-on-the-make way of his. ""The Switch"" has many of the same virtues of 2002s ""About a Boy"" with Hugh Grant excellent in a similar role. The film also plays with the difficulties of late-entry fatherhood that ""The Kids Are All Right"" handles so brilliantly. Though the film never quite rises to the level of either the filmmakers show enough restraint to keep things interesting Aniston and Bateman keep things both light and dark when they should and Robinsons Sebastian steals everyones heart. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review The SitterDecember 9 2011Its a SwitchAugust 19 2010The actors Jason BatemanMay 2 2010Teens and the morning after pillApril 6 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTSpermWallyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-switch-20100820,0,1574085.story",200,theswitch19,theswitch,latimes

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With ""The Switch"" it appears Hollywood has discovered a new subgenre of the romantic comedy the artificial-insemination rom-com. Has a nice ring to it doesnt it? If youll remember (you probably wont) Jennifer Lopez covered similar ground earlier this year in ""The Back-up Plan."" The Cliffs Notes version of these movies reads like this Forty-something woman wants to have a baby cant find a worthy guy has baby anyway turns out she needs a guy. ""The Switch"" at least launches its effort from a more refreshing angle. In a screwball-comedy setup Aniston plays Kassie a New Yorker whose girlfriends throw her an ""Im Getting Pregnant Party"" where she will finalize the procedure. Call this ""Insemination and the City."" Problem time. Kassies best friend Wally (Jason Bateman) disagrees with her decision because hes in love with her (of course). Bateman is well-cast playing Wally with a neurotic bent that recalls a taller better-looking version of Woody Allen. At the party Wallys displeasure is amplified by the sight of Roland (Patrick Wilson) the buff blond sperm donor who is in attendance to lend his ""ingredient."" Sulking in the bathroom while the party rages on Wally now drunk accidentally washes Rolands semen down the drain. Panicked he quickly replaces it with his own. THE SWITCH  out of 4 stars. Rated PG-13 for mature thematic content sexual material including dialogue some nudity drug use and language. As the rom-com universe would have it Wally wakes up the next day remembering nothing. Once pregnant Kassie moves back to Minnesota to raise her child. Seven years later she returns to New York with young Sebastian and guess what Hes an adorable neurotic munchkin prone to overly analytical tirades. Wally realizes that Sebastian is unmistakably his and spends the rest of the film strategizing ways to tell Kassie that he hijacked her pregnancy. Aniston and Bateman find a funny chemistry together and the films bemusing setup unfolds with wit and charm. As 6-year-old Sebastian Thomas Robinson steals every scene hes in. ""The Switch"" was originally going to be called ""The Baster."" Unfortunately the name change wasnt the only part of this movie that needed a little more finessing. (""The Baster"" is in fact the title of the films source material a short story written by Jeffrey Eugenides Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ""Middlesex."") Plot points in ""The Switch"" -- specifically in the second half -- are snapped together like Legos which is to say everything falls into place nicely but without real panache. Once Kassie is back in New York she falls for Roland. We know this because she tells Wally so. But the filmmakers show us very little to back up the new arrangement. Its simply another hurdle for Wally to jump over. Aiding Wally in his rom-com obstacles is Jeff Goldblum (talk about neurotic) who is oddly inserted into the movie as a friend and confidant. As Leonard he has little to do with anything but its his sage advice to Wally that sends the movie off in different directions. Goldblum handles the minor role almost with a wink to the audience. This is not to say that the film doesnt work. It generates a fair share of tender moments (synched to a soundtrack filled with superfluous weepy piano). The blossoming relationship between Wally and Sebastian is played especially right. ""The Switch"" isnt a bad a.i. rom-com. Its just not a particularly great one.

(AP Photo/Miramax Films-Disney Macall Polay) by Carrie Rickey Film Critic Twitter icon carrierickey Close icon Carrie Rickey Film Critic Mail icon carriedrickeygmail.com Twitter icon carrierickey Wally Mars (Jason Bateman) looks great on paper. Its in the flesh that the Wall Street broker resembles Eeyore. Wally is human buzzkill so gloomy that next to him Woody Allen looks like Pollyanna. In The Switch the Jason Bateman film his fans have been waiting for he is the undateable in pursuit of the unattainable. More about The Baster >> Wallys Venus is Kassie Larson (Jennifer Aniston) the sugar cookie to his sour pickle. He loves Kassie a TV producer but is too timid to bust a move. He lives on the crumbs of her friendship. When she decides to have a baby solo Kassie rejects Wallys offer to donate sperm. At her ""insemination party"" the drunk and jealous Wally switches his stuff with that of donor Roland (Patrick Wilson golden and bold as Wally is ashen and meek). Then Wally blacks out. By turns rowdy and rueful The Switch is a comedy with serious ramifications not least of which is the question what makes a family? The film relies on a couple of other switcheroos. In terms of the standard formula it switches mistaken identity for mistaken paternity. It switches the male/female relationship for that between father and son. Its switches the traditional meet/marry/mate order of affairs for the test tube. In other words its not strictly a romantic farce but a reproductive comedy about accidental insemination. Like When Harry Met Sally . . . its implication is that a warm friendship is a stronger foundation for marriage than one based on hormonal heat. At their best workmanlike directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (who made the broad Blades of Glory) do not get in Batemans way. The Switch shows how his Wally goes from a glass-half-empty kind of guy to a glass-half-full one. (The source material Jeffrey Eugenides short story ""Baster"" was more a tale of the tyranny of beauty and told as much from the females perspective as the males.) Resembling an unmade bed in a parka Bateman plays Wally as that guy who just when things get intimate walls himself off. As Kassie Aniston furnishes the obligatory energy and sparkle but she is a supporting player in what has been conceived as the story of Wallys transformation. In the script from Allan Loeb the agent of change is Sebastian Kassies son (wonderfully played by preternaturally worried Thomas Robinson) in whom Wally recognizes his own fatalism and neurosis. When Wally realizes that Sebastian might be his issue he remembers his drunken stunt but cant quite explain it to Kassie. Bateman has a self-lacerating quality that is as unnerving as it is nervily funny. For the most part it carries the day and the film. The films comic-relief duties are expertly handled by Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis who are straight-out hilarious as the best-friends-of more neurotic if possible than the leads. Bateman might carry the film but Aniston furnishes the aerodynamics. As she has been for so many male costars she is a deft foil for Bateman her souffle airiness keeping things from getting unbearably heavy. During The Switch I thought of her terrific performance in the similarly themed The Object of My Affection and wondered why there arent more movies built around her singular gifts. The Switch  (out of four stars) Directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck. With Jason Bateman Jennifer Aniston Jeff Goldblum Juliette Lewis and Thomas Robinson. Distributed by Miramax Films.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The romantic comedy has never had a star as depressing as Jennifer Aniston. Its not the movies -- well it isnt simply the movies. ""Picture Perfect ""The Object of My Affection ""Along Came Polly ""Rumor Has It ""Management ""The Bounty Hunter This is in-flight entertainment grating enough to send more than a fed-up flight attendant shrieking down an inflatable slide.Aniston is also distressing because shes the genres most modern star. In her the timeless goal of the romantic comedy (falling in love) now intersects with the specific desperate straits of certain single women (manlessness childlessness the quest for perfection). The depressing part is that the women Aniston plays rarely seem depressed by this. For her loneliness doubt fear sadness and worry are not emotions. Theyre shades of a nail polish her pedicurist isnt allowed to use.Aniston gives real problems the same skeptical stammer and crypto-ditzy insouciance that made her a great television star. Her limitation in the movies is that shes impervious to growth. If Diane Keaton and Meg Ryan were the same in their comedies (choosy neurotic insatiable) they could rely on their principles to guide them. In fact Ryan got so good at idealism that it warped her. Those inflated lips didnt ruin her career; cynicism did. She changed the movies didnt and the tension began to chafe.That wont be a problem for Aniston. Her adventures in good movies like ""The Good Girl and ""Friends With Money never make her better -- or different -- in bad ones. In ""The Switch she plays a New Yorker who so wants a baby that she places an online ad for a sperm donor. This is only mildly different from ""The Object of My Affection. Gay Paul Rudd is now not-gay Jason Bateman whose character Wally is in love with Kassie (Aniston).Kassie wants to stay friends with Wally -- hes a financial guy whos too neurotic for her. So for the father she chooses a better-looking more seemingly conventional man a stranger named Roland (Patrick Wilson). Inebriated at her insemination party (its the sort of weird event the movie wants us to believe all unmarried women are doing) Wally winds up replacing Rolands sperm with his.Until that point the movie loosely resembles ""Baster a Jeffrey Eugenides short story that was published in 2006. The story was more complicated. Wally and Kassie -- Eugenides named her Tomasina -- once dated. She got pregnant and aborted the child. His psyche never quite recovered. Neither did hers. Its an excellent consideration of narcissism beauty and social expectation. Needless to say ""The Switch is not. Allan Loeb wrote the script. Josh Gordon and Will Speck directed. What theyve done is concoct something gimmicky and banal.Kassie leaves for a number of years and returns with a soon-to-be 6-year-old son (Thomas Robinson) who is a wee Wally a joylessly self-aware hypochondriac. None of the scenes between Aniston and Bateman work. Only in a screwball comedy would a man this uptight tolerate a woman whose life is as arbitrary as Kassies.The more honest movie would have paired him with Juliette Lewis who plays Anistons best friend. Lewis does her job with as little seriousness as she can get away with. Were often supposed to believe that Anistons characters are free-spirited and spontaneous. In the future she should make sure Lewis hasnt been hired for the same comedy. She makes Aniston seem dull which isnt usually true of her. In any case the usual girlfriends-on-the-treadmill chitchat takes place between Bateman and Jeff Goldblum as Wallys best friend.Eventually the filmmakers tire of Kassie and her pursuit of Roland. They appear to realize that the best relationship in the film is between Bateman and Robinson who has the scary-wonderful savant quality of a child sure to attract a ""60 Minutes correspondent. Its similar to what Hugh Grant underwent in ""About a Boy.Wally and his secret son explore New York and you can feel them falling in a kind of love with each other. They dont merely catch up with Kassie emotionally. They evolve beyond her. This is bad news for Aniston. Its also the inverse of the Meg Ryan problem. The movie changes and she doesnt.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Originally titled The Baster after the Jeffrey Eugenides story it adapts The Switch is accidentally 2010s most meta movie. It shares a basic premise with its source in which an aging single womans ex-boyfriend-turned-pal substitutes his own semen for her sperm donors. But the other half of its DNA belongs to the blandest of romantic comedies the sort that pair two likeable stars a thin gimmick and hope that chemistry compensates for a toothless script. Its the bastard child of a thousand Made Of Honors. Turns out its hard to make one man swapping his sperm for anothers seem cute as much as The Switch tries. Bateman plays a smitten tagalong to Jennifer Aniston a perpetually single New York TV producer who decides that being alone shouldnt get in the way of having a child. After hiring a smart handsome stranger (Patrick Wilson) to donate some sperm--an event celebrated at an insemination party--Aniston gets pregnant unaware that Bateman has washed Wilsons seed down the drain and provided his own. (Directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck the team behind Blades Of Glory soften the moment by making him outrageously drunk and tripping on some herbal drug provided by Anistons best friend Juliette Lewis.) Flash forward seven years Aniston has left New York then returned with a child in tow whos inherited Batemans looks and abundant neuroses. Bateman deserves some credit for almost making his character work playing him as a man almost charmingly honest about the terror and insecurity that plague him. In one inspired scene that finds him on a blind date hoping to forget Aniston he turns a joke about the future hell share with his new companion from a winning bit of self-deprecation into a dark fantasia of alienation and Internet pornography. Trouble is his palpable glumness--and the deception at the movies core--dont really have a place in the candy-colored romantic-fantasy world where The Switch insists on staying. (The arrival of the adorably miserable tyke in the second half doesnt help much either.) A mixture of two species never meant to breed its a film with no world to call its own.

Id already been through Jennifer Lopez in The Back-Up Plan and frankly one screwball sperm-donor chick flick per year seemed more than enough. But The Switch is a pleasant surprise. Its a by-the-numbers movie but the dots that get connected feel new. Aniston playing a forward-thinking lonely girl is at her most sexy and charming -- and no Im not saying that to be nice Im saying it because shes sexy and charming dammit. Why all the Internet brickbats toward this woman? Sure a lot of her movies (such as The Bounty Hunter) are crap but that has more to do with the current state of romantic comedy than it does with her willowy and buoyant middle-class appeal. As it turns out The Switch is more Jason Batemans movie than Anistons and he makes the most of what might have been a stock role. He plays Wally the frowningly downbeat way too sincere friend of Kassie (Aniston) -- whom of course hes secretly in love with. The sperm-donor mix-up plot is the least elegant aspect of the movie so put your sophisticated comedy hopes on hold as you suffer through the following description Kassie on her own but eager to have a baby has personally selected her donor a square-jawed surfer-blond dude named Roland (Patrick Wilson). To toast her impending pregnancy she throws a party in which Roland is asked to leave his crucial sample in the bathroom. He does -- but Wally in a drunken haze pours it down the drain and leaves his own sample instead. Cut to seven years later when Kassie is living in Minnesota with her 6-year-old son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) who unbeknownst to everyone is really Wallys son. Even Wally doesnt know it; he has no memory of that fateful night or of the switch that he drunkenly passive-aggressively instigated. When Kassie and Sebastian move back to New York though and Wally begins to hang out with them he and the kid hit it off. They may be barely conscious of it but both father and son are neurotic slightly gloomy and winningly smart in exactly the same ways. The Switch squeezes fresh laughs out of what is in essence a rather startlingly post-Freudian nature-trumps-nurture view of child development. Wally and Sebastian make a very funny and touchingly well-matched pair of saturnine brainiacs with goggle-eyed Thomas Robinson playing Sebastian as a chip off the old grouch. Hes not a brat exactly but hes so discerning and cautious and fussy about everything from Peking Duck to indoor rock climbing that hes like a tiny annoying adult. Whereas Bateman who often seems like the worlds most doleful late-night talk-show host makes Wally a fellow who cant get his life together because he has never let go of the complaining child within. There are winsome touches in The Switch like the way that Sebastian collects brand-new picture frames so he can pretend that the models in the sample photos are his family members. And theres some nice clowning from Jeff Goldblum who delivers spaced-out nuggets of wisdom as Wallys faithful colleague. The romantic-triangle plot however is standard issue Wilson looking more than ever like Paul Newman does his jerk-lite variations and Bateman winds his way toward the big moment when he declares his feelings to Aniston. Fortunately hes not standing in the rain or running after her at an airport. So you can enjoy what happens without feeling too guilty about it in the morning.

So he drunkenly switches his sperm for the donors. Seven years later the kid (Thomas Robinson) shows up like Batemans Mini-Me. What to do? The film offers few -- make that no -- surprises.

"The Switch review A step ahead of most recent rom-coms - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsThe Switch review A step ahead of most recent rom-comsAfter an hour fertility farce germinatesAugust 19 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic2 1/2 stars Set in Manhattan ""The Switch"" is all over the place but around the halfway point it starts getting interesting and the people who put it together are at least working in a realm of reasonable intelligence and wit and respect for the audience. I wish it were great but ""pretty good"" puts it ahead of plenty of recent romantic comedies. Puh-LEN-ty. When words such as ""subversive"" and ""offbeat"" and ""unconventional"" pepper a commercial American rom-coms production notes you know the studio (in this case Miramax) is already in a sweat regarding how to sell it. The movie comes from the 1996 Jeffrey Eugenides short story ""Baster"" originally published in The New Yorker. Eugenides story takes care of roughly the first half-hour; adapter Allan Loeb fills in the rest. He softens the harder edges of the original (including any mention of abortion) for better or worse. Jennifer Aniston gets top billing but the character played by Jason Bateman sets the tone. The setup Single and ready for a kid TV producer Kassie (Aniston) decides on artificial insemination. Her longtime friend and long-ago lover Wally (Bateman) a mope by temperament whose opening voice-over spiel lays out his grim views on romantic love does not get the nod. Instead the sperm donor is Roland a hardy rock-climbing Michigan lug ( Patrick Wilson). The title refers to a switcheroo Batemans character pulls at the ""insemination party"" substituting (drunkenly and then passing out) his own donation to the cause for Rolands. Seven years later Kassies sons quirks appear to have more in common with Wally than the presumptive birth father. Wally has a secret. The movie is about how long he can keep it. ""The Switch"" enters the marketplace at a time when audiences may be tiring of sperm what with everything from ""The Back-Up Plan"" to ""The Kids Are All Right."" Batemans comic wiles are considerable his ironic inflections deadly -- and his ability to turn off a good portion of any audience undeniable. He is not an actor who cares much about being liked. Aniston sometimes feels sidelined in her own movie (she is after all a woman playing a woman; what else is new?). I suppose theres a sameness to her work on screen yet I dont know of a steadily working actress in Hollywood who gets a more consistently bad rap -- based solely on the quality of most of her scripts such as the misery-inducing ""Bounty Hunter"" -- than this one. What she needs is luck and a better agent. There are three reasons this movies limitations and compromises can be forgiven. One and two the directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck the duo behind my second-favorite Will Ferrell comedy (""Blades of Glory""). Their touch isnt startling or dynamic but they know how hard to push a joke and four times out of five where to put the camera. And No. 3? Jeff Goldblum. As Wallys stockbroker partner the actor is stuck firmly in sounding-board-for-the-male-lead territory. Yet you find yourself smiling each time he pops back into the plot. My kind of scene-stealer You dont realize the scene he just stole is gone until two scenes later. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic content sexual material including dialogue some nudity drug use and language) Cast Jennifer Aniston (Kassie); Jason Bateman (Wally); Patrick Wilson (Roland); Jeff Goldblum (Leonard); Juliette Lewis (Debbie); Thomas Robinson (Sebastian) Credits Directed by Josh Gordon and Will Speck; written by Allan Loeb based on the short story ""Baster"" by Jeffrey Eugenides; produced by Albert Berger and Ron Yerxa.

"Switch The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; switch-the ) Switch The (United States 2010) August 18 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Switch made me want to gnash my teeth in frustration. Nested within the restrictive confines of a middling romantic comedy is a secondary plot of some immediacy and power. It results in several moving scenes and allows Jason Batemans acting to rise to unexpected heights. Yet all thats good about The Switch is undermined by the need to conform to romantic comedy standards and by the predictable performance of a miscast Jennifer Aniston. Although the dramatic elements of The Switch vary from passable to strong the comedy is often forced and generic. In the end the film seems confused about what it wants to do and be and its inability to decide results in a finished product that is unable to satisfy. The Switch opens in New York City ""seven years ago."" Best friends Wally (Jason Bateman) and Kassie (Jennifer Aniston) are having lunch when she announces that she intends to get pregnant and she wants Wally to help find a suitable sperm donor. That honor eventually goes to Roland (Patrick Wilson) who needs the money so he and his wife can make ends meet. While drunk and high on an ""herbal supplement"" Wally switches Rolands sperm for his own. Afterward his memory of the event is hazy so when Kassie announces shes pregnant it never occurs to him that he is the father of her unborn child. She moves away from New York so she can raise her son in a different environment. Seven years later Kassie returns with a six-year old boy Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) in tow. Sebastian is like a miniature Wally and that triggers Wallys memory. He tries to tell Kassie but in true sit-com fashion obstacles block his path. So while Sebastian bonds with ""Uncle Wally"" now Kassies most reliable babysitter she embarks upon a romance with the recently divorced Roland. Meanwhile both Wally and Kassie are repressing their feelings for one another with Kassie doing a considerably better job at hiding things. Circumstances come to a head as they often do in movies of this sort when Wally works up the courage to spill the beans. The strength and heart of The Switch lies in the relationship between Wally and Sebastian. To give directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (working from Allan Loebs screenplay which is based on a short story by Jeffrey ""Virgin Suicides"" Eugenides) their due this is developed with a deftness of touch and an understanding of the yearning of a fatherless child to find an adult male role model and of a childless father to bond with his son. A pair of scenes between Bateman and effective young performer Thomas Robinson are affecting without being overly sentimental. At its best The Switch is reminiscent of About a Boy although sadly there are too few times when the connection is apparent. Instead The Switch spends much time attempting to generate cheap laughs and exploring a romance that is d.o.a. The casting of Jennifer Aniston possibly necessary for the project to be greenlighted (she is listed as an executive producer) is the productions Achilles Heel. Aniston spends the movie being the same Jennifer Aniston who has inhabited so many mediocre perky romantic comedies in recent years rather than the Jennifer Aniston who showed her acting chops in The Good Girl. Theres no evidence that Aniston shares chemistry with any of her co-stars. Theres no spark between her and Jason Bateman; we feel his longing for her but its not reciprocated. In fact she doesnt even seem very friendly with him. Theres no sense of sexual attraction between her and Patrick Wilson. And theres no discernable motherly impulse where Thomas Robinson is concerned. Its impossible to have a successful romantic comedy (even of the generic sort) when one of the leads fails to connect with her co-stars. Many of the scenes that work are ones in which Aniston is absent. There is an exception but the effectiveness of that moment is entirely because of Bateman. To the extent that there is successful comedy in The Switch it can be attributed to the supporting performance of Jeff Goldblum. Goldblum plays Wallys obligatory Best Male Friend. Hes on hand to be a sounding board and provide advice. Unfortunately his screen time is severely curtailed. Much of the failed comedy can be attributed to the presence of the shrill Juliette Lewis who has not improved with age. Shes Kassies obligatory Best Female Friend and is around to dis Wally and throw a ""pregnancy party"" for Kassie. Fortunately her screen time is severely curtailed. It would be nice to argue that the good outweighs the bad in The Switch but its a wash. A slightly more dramatic tone a subtle shift of the focus from the adult romance to the father/son bond or a more rounded performance from Aniston might have resulted in a worthwhile experience. The Switchs unevenness makes it impossible to recommend for theatrical viewing although it may play better when it reaches cable and requires less effort to see. As flawed as the production is the good parts place it into the watchable category.

Last week when asked by the New Yorkers book blog about the film--which stars Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman and was directed by the team responsible for the Will Ferrell skating farce Blades of Glory--the Virgin Suicides author carefully drew a distinction between his highbrow literary effort and its Disney-distributed successor.""The fact that the movie has a different title than the story might give you some idea of how close a correspondence exists between the two"" Eugenides said. ""My story is about an unattractive man whos in love with a beautiful woman. It deals comedically with the Darwinist question Is it better to be good-looking or clever? Now Jason Bateman isnt unattractive. The casting went in the other direction as they say out in Hollywood and the movie followed it.""To be sure The Switch is not a film about cleverness although its not totally unconcerned with beauty and Darwinism. Aniston plays Kassie a New York TV producer who having failed to find a husband by the age of 40 informs her sad-sack best friend Wally (Bateman) that shes on the hunt for a sperm donor. Though wholly devoted to Kassie Wally doesnt have the genes of the blond studly Roland (Patrick Wilson) who Kassie hires to provide her baby-making ""ingredient."" Blackout drunk at Kassies insemination party Wally hijacks the sperm cup replacing Rolands high-quality DNA with his own. The darker details of the night slip Wallys mind until Kassie returns to New York seven years later with her young son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson excellent). Wally cant help but notice the similarities between himself and Sebastian--both are brown-haired bully magnets both are such extreme neurotic fatalists that they repel virtually everyone but each other.Eugenidess story ends shortly after the birth of the kid with Wally looking down into the crib and recognizing a ""potato nose [and] buggy eyes"" as his own. The back hour of The Switch has Kassie reacquainting herself with both Wally and Roland becoming romantically involved with the latter under the impression that he is her sons father while Wally--still single still smitten with Kassie and increasingly attached to Sebastian--struggles to come clean about his feelings and his secret crime of insemination.Ironically a more faithful adaptation of Eugenidess short story would have made a better traditional vehicle for its A-list star. The first three pages of the story put us inside the heroines head before suddenly switching to Wallys perspective. The Switch unfolds entirely from Wallys point of view guided by his grating narration. Eugenidess heroine is a tough conspicuously sexy career girl singlemindedly superficial but ultimately flawed and relatable--much like Anistons career-making Rachel Green from Friends. The Switchs Kassie barely registers as a character. There are a lot of beauty-filtered close-ups of Aniston looking every bit the flawless yoga goddess with lush hair the same golden tone as her tanned skin Forever 30 despite the fact that her character would logically be in her late 40s by the films end. This may be evidence enough as to why Wally wants her but the film is generally uninterested in who Kassie actually is.Saddled with the responsibility of carrying the film Bateman acquits himself admirably by playing it straight developing a genuinely convincing and affecting chemistry with Robinson and taking his characters repression seriously. The Switch is most notable for its confident tone which is unexpectedly not ha-ha funny; the sperm switch scene is the closest it gets to slapstick and despite its sympathy for the socially awkward it avoids the halting comedy of discomfort thats currently trendy (The Office Cyrus). Essentially a lovable loser romantic fantasy in which insecurity is the great demon to be overcome The Switch wouldnt dare suggest that the physically perfect interpersonally competent and highly capable have it easier than the less genetically gifted. All Bateman has to do to get the girl is get up the courage to ask.

Bright spots come in performances by Jennifer Aniston and Jason Bateman as the leads with Jeff Goldblum and Juliette Lewis adding sparkle in the roles of best friends. The Miramax film will have to rely the actors drawing power if it hopes to score midlevel boxoffice grosses with this release by Disney.In a year of comedies dealing with artificial insemination from ""The Back-Up Plan"" to ""The Kids Are All Right"" ""Switch"" certainly takes the least plausible angle on the subject. The film imagines that Batemans Wally a Wall Street investment guru has been in love with Anistons Kassie forever but because she has put him in the ""friendship zone"" he wont admit this to anyone including himself. When she decides to get pregnant he is more than willing to provide the sperm but Kassie prefers to go shopping for the perfect sperm donor.She settles on Patrick Wilsons dashing Roland. Lewis as best gal pal Debbie throws an ""insemination party"" for Kassie where an agitated Wally ingests drugs and downs booze until he is wasted enough to substitute his sperm for Rolands. Yes he does.Then youre asked to believe Wally is so drunk he cant even remember doing this. The memory does gradually return to him seven years later when Kassie returns to Manhattan with a 6-year-old son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) who is neurotic pessimistic and nurtures a dark side -- just like Uncle Wally. Are you buying any of this?You might as well because the film contains bright moments of comedy especially whenever Wally relates his Kassie confessions to business partner Leonard (Goldblum) and touching moments of drama in the developing relationship between a father and son who dont yet realize their blood ties.The film could have used sharper scenes between Aniston and Bateman. The model here is too Woody Allen-ish with Wallys neuroses and kvetching dominating their scenes without any real romantic spark. A romantic comedy needs at least some romance between its leads.Alan Loeb penned the script from a short story by Jeffrey Eugenides and you can imagine that the premise played better on paper. The first half of the film the ""seven years ago"" section wobbles because the male is frozen in inaction and the female is all frantic action. But in the second half beginning when Kassie and Sebastian return from Minnesota directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck (""Blades of Glory"") hit their stride.There is more warmth between Wally and Kassie because of her motherhood and Wallys increasing interest in her son. And the ways the film finds to contrast father and son -- their shared hypochondria for instance -- bring a few chuckles. A complication is introduced when Kassie begins to date her sperm donor but the film treats Roland so cavalierly that its hard to take seriously this threat to the potential romance between Wally and Kassie.Technical credits are smooth.Opens Friday Aug. 20 (Disney)Production Miramax Films and Mandate Pictures present a Bona Fide/Echo Films productionCast Jennifer Aniston Jason Bateman Patrick Wilson Jeff Goldblum Juliette Lewis Thomas RobinsonDirectors Josh Gordon Will SpeckScreenwriter Alan LoebBased on a short story by Jeffrey EugenidesProducers Albert Berger Ron YerxaExecutive producers Nathan Kahane Jennifer Aniston Kristen HahnDirector of photography Jess HallProduction designer Adam StockhausenMusic Alex WurmanCostume designer Kasia Walicka MaimoneEditor John AxelradRated PG-13 101 minutes FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Kirk Honeycutt THRnewsthr.com thr AP THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

Generating pre-release controversy between star-exec producer Jennifer Aniston and Fox News Bill OReilly artificial-insemination comedy ""The Switch"" turns out to have bigger problems than TV newsies. An unfunny manipulative romance about two unlikable people and their prop of a son the pic mangles the premise of its source material (""Baster"" a 1996 short story by Pulitzer-winning novelist Jeffrey Eugenides) in ways that ought to baffle viewers of all sociopolitical stripes. Thanks in part to the free publicity provided by OReilly the Miramax release should do respectable business upon its Aug. 20 release. The pic gets off to a curious start in introducing its leads dour stockbroker Wally (Jason Bateman) and long-suffering TV producer Kassie (Aniston). As these longtime platonic pals meet for lunch in a Manhattan hotspot hypochondriac Wally shows Kassie an iPhone snapshot of his genitals on which he fears theres some sort of growth. Kassie then changes the subject to announce shes planning to have a baby using donated sperm to do so. This off-putting exchange provokes the first of many disagreements between the two and Wally is content to pout until he receives an invitation to Kassies ""insemination party."" There he meets Kassies smarmy sperm donor (Patrick Wilson) and proceeds to drink himself into oblivion whereupon he half-unintentionally spills the chosen ones seed and surreptitiously replaces it with his own. While a few lines of dialogue are taken verbatim from the Eugenides story (though Wallys opening voiceover in which he muses ""Look at us always rushed always late; I guess thats why they call it the human race"" is most assuredly not) the source material provides only the first 15 minutes or so of screentime. The rest of the script (by Allan Loeb) has been invented wholesale. While Eugenides story portrays Wallys switch as a twisted almost rape-like violation helmers Josh Gordon and Will Speck attempt to play it off as a charmingly bumbling folly (and to further excuse it by making Wally drunk at the time) imparting a sour feeling to all that follows. After Kassie conveniently moves to Michigan she returns to New York seven years later with 6-year-old Sebastian (Thomas Robinson) in tow. A walking rebuke of B.F. Skinner the kid is cartoonishly stricken with neuroses hypochondria and age-inappropriate cynicism despite never having met the father from whom he derives these traits. What follows are alternately tender and cloying scenes of oddball father-son bonding. Standard hijinks and simmering attractions ensue complete with dog reaction shots and gags about modern art. First-timer Robinson is undeniably adorable adept at using his giant eyes to tearjerking effect but theres little he can do with a script that requires him to speak in sentences no 6-year-old has ever uttered. Batemans usually charming prickliness takes on a darker shade as he limns such an unpleasant character while Aniston is largely a cipher. One bright spot is supporting player Jeff Goldblum who shows up as Wallys wry co-worker/confidant though he appears to spend half his scenes on the verge of cracking up over his own private jokes; one wishes hed bothered to share them with the audience. Juliette Lewis is likable enough as his female counterpart. Tech credits are pro.
