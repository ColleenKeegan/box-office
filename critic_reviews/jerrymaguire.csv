In this freshly minted take on a spoiled yups fall and redemption Tom Cruise plays a high-powered sports agent Jerry Maguire who lives in a frenzy of dealmaking. Jerry works for SMI (Sports Management International) the sports equivalent of a Hollywood talent agency like CAA; his clients include the top stars of baseball football and basketball. In an age of global marketing the athletes are franchises grinning jock pashas who sell products by selling themselves. Jerry is the shark on the sidelines the guy with the cellular phone who turns a first-round draft choice into a multimillion-dollar endorsement industry. To Jerry everythings a commodity his clients his bitch-goddess NFL-publicist fiancee (Kelly Preston) his life. Hes on a merry-go-round that wont stop and Crowe whose previous films Say Anything... (1989) and Singles (1992) gazed with affection upon the romantic yearnings of a newly cooled-out generation here zigzags into denser faster more cynical terrain. For about 45 minutes Jerry Maguire is an explosion of media-age filmmaking energy. Whether Jerry is closing deals or flirting through his bachelor party (pretty much another deal) Crowe catches us up in the mad unreality of it all -- an adrenaline-capitalist high that just keeps feeding on itself. Jerry though isnt quite at home as master of the universe. Hes got everything but deep down he knows hes disconnected wedded to nothing but his own pitches. In a crisis of conscience he drafts a corporate ""mission statement"" advocating that SMI pay more attention to fewer clients (for less revenue). Does he realize its heresy? Unconsciously perhaps. Within days hes been fired tossed off the merry-go-round a dealmaker with no more deals to make. Jerry Maguire is the story of how Jerry cut loose from his identity gently stumbles into a new kind of life. For a while I expected a familiar sermon about a top gun who finds like his integrity man. After all how is Jerry going to satisfy his ego now? By writing fiction? Crowe however has something subtler in mind. Jerry still wants to be a sports agent. He just wants to slow down to reconnect with his clients -- with himself. Jerry Maguire doesnt have a conventional narrative drive and thats part of its charm; its a movie of quick feints and jabs. Jerry dumps his fiancee and sets up shop with Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) a single mother so inspired by his mission statement -- and his dimples -- that she quits her job as an SMI bookkeeper to go to work for him. Jerry likewise hangs on to just one client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) an upstart wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals who stakes his shot at superstardom on Jerrys undivided loyalty. To be or not to be -- a human being that is. Thats the question that courses through nearly every scene of Jerry Maguire. Americas favorite star is still on smiling Cruise control but now he finesses it into a dance. He seduces -- then steps back; he turns on the charm -- then lets it slide into pools of doubt. Its Cruises deftest performance yet as a slickster grasping for the decency in himself. As Dorothy Renee Zellweger with her oval face and slightly daffy little-girl voice at first calls up images of a more petite Victoria Jackson but she grows on you. When she turns her imploring stare on Cruise she melts through his sheen the way Debra Winger melted through Richard Geres in An Officer and a Gentleman. One of the most likable things about Jerry Maguire is the way it keeps throwing you curves. Jerry and Dorothy get married but (small detail) he still has to fall in love with her. The biggest curve of all is Cuba Gooding Jr.s ferocious star-making performance as Rod the hot-dog rebel. Gooding so earnest in Boyz N the Hood here breaks loose into Ali-like flights of punchy combative eloquence. When he ""magically"" emerges from a mishap on the field his ebullient reaction -- fueled by the knowledge that now at last hell be ""shown"" the money -- calls up all the soulful real-world triumph the movie has been reaching for. Its truly a feel-great moment.

Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast Cameron Crowes shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles. An exceptionally tasty contempo comedic romance ""Jerry Maguire"" runs an unusual pattern on its way to scoring an unexpected number of emotional social and entertaining points. Smartly written and boasting a sensational cast Cameron Crowes shrewdly observed third feature also gives Tom Cruise one of his very best roles and this combination of audience-pleasing factors looks to translate into muscular B.O. through the holidays and beyond. Ostensibly a tart look at the greed and selfishness rampant in professional sports as seen through the career of a sharp players agent the film takes gratifying twists and turns on its way to keenly examining the lifestyles of numerous characters and hitting emotional chords one never would have anticipated in such a picture. Although it has its conventional sitcommy elements and goes on a bit too long the dialogue is so good and the performances so alive to the potential of the characters that the faults remain quite minor. Pic actually gets off to an uneasy start with an overly frenetic unattractively cut opening sequence revealing the fast-lane lifestyle of Jerry Maguire (Cruise) a slick agent who handles 72 clients for L.A.-based Sports Management Intl. But in a crisis of conscience Jerry asks himself ""Who had I become? Just another shark in a suit?"" and dashes off a long memo to the company staff titled ""The Things We Think and Do Not Say The Future Of Our Business"" an uncensored think-piece that suggests the agency should represent fewer athletes and care about them more. Even at the outset the film gets credit for beginning where the more typical Hollywood film would end with the previously avaricious hero suddenly renouncing his lifelong crassness in a climactic conversion to moral and ethical goodness. Jerrys ill-advised frankness promptly gets him fired although his bold words win him the loyalty of agency accountant Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) who quits to join him on his Quixotic effort to be true to himself and stay in the game at the same time this despite her being a single mother to 6-year-old Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki). The desperate Jerry manages to hang on to one steadfast client Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) who wants major bucks in a forthcoming contract renewal. But Rods recent performance and attitude make him a questionable commodity so Jerry goes to great lengths to represent the top college draft pick quarterback Frank Cushman (Jerry OConnell) which would definitely put him back in the game. When Jerry suddenly begins to look like a loser rather a winner his relationship with eyes-on-the-prize fiancee Avery (Kelly Preston) hits the rocks  whereupon he looks at the pretty vulnerable Dorothy with different eyes. Dorothy and her son live with her divorced remark-prone older sister Laurel (Bonnie Hunt) and the constant presence in the living room of a bunch of nattering women from a divorcees support group seems like something straight out of one of co-producer James L. Brooks old sitcoms. But the relationship between Jerry who is humbled but not deterred by his diminished status and Dorothy nonetheless proceeds and in very interesting ways as they nimbly navigate the initial boss-employee conflict cautiously reveal the extent of their mutual physical attraction consider the implications of an affair and confront the realities of life beyond the fun part particularly where Dorothys son is concerned. Tiptoeing through potentially maudlin territory Crowe makes the kid stuff some of the very best in the picture with the considerable help of young Lipnicki who is simply fantastic. A funny-looking tyke with blond hair and glasses he quickly comes to adore the new man in his mothers life and when Jerry and Dorothy hit a turning point in their relationship the difference the resolution will make to the boys future becomes the substance of wrenching and fortunately underplayed emotion. Contrasted boldly withthis rather touchy and unresolved situation is the wildly devoted relationship between the flamboyant Rod Tidwell and his outspoken wife Marcee (Regina King). This man and woman who have one kid and another on the way live at high intensity are often among members of their extended family and set a standard of compatibility that proves somewhat intimidating to the newer couple. This and more relationship and lifestyle scrutiny provides the rich fabric against which is played out the foreground action of Jerrys quest for the primacy of personal loyalty. Rod impressively sticks with his downtrodden agent through the toughest of times and their many conversations about the players career and the realities of life in pro sports possess the verisimilitude of good journalism Crowes former trade. Since as long ago as ""Risky Business"" Cruise has specialized in playing slick operators who get what they want. This is Jerry Maguire at the beginning but the majority of the film has him hanging by a thread often in embarrassing positions and the actor conveys this with his customary enthusiasm as well as with a self-deprecatory quality and humor that are new and welcome. One can truly credit him with a fine performance. All the same there is nothing he can do to prevent the scene-stealing of Gooding as the larger-than-life Tidwell every inch the modern athlete with his strutting ego showboating style and frank preference for money over the glory of the game. Zellweger and little Lipnicki also commit their fair shares of larceny as both are adorable and heart-breakingly appealing as Jerrys potential future family. Cast is all but perfect down to the smallest role and is filled out with plenty of real-life sports figures and newscasters. Crowes script is considerably more off-center and distinctive than his somewhat slick direction while production values are deeply pro all the way.

"WashingtonPost.com Jerry Maguire A Touchdown Pass Go to the ""Jerry Maguire"" Page Jerry Maguire A Touchdown Pass By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer December 13 1996 Tom Cruise is the Risky Businessman all grown up and wondering where his life went in the joyous redemptive romantic comedy ""Jerry Maguire."" Like so many of Cruises best characters Maguire begins his journey in the fast lane but like many a frenzied yuppie he suddenly realizes he doesnt know where hes going at such dangerous speeds. Though originally marketed as a sports movie this affable picture is really another variation on ""A Christmas Carol"" just as its cocky charismatic hero is Scrooge with a cell phone. As a top agent with the Los Angeles-based Sports Management International Jerry squeezes big-league bucks out of first-round draft choices drooling for sneaker endorsements. The men and women whose talent he sells have become little more than commodities in Jerrys eyes. And while he hasnt really given it much thought -- who has time? -- his life is as empty as George Steinbrenners heart. Then thanks to the son of an injured hockey player Jerry receives the wake-up call. As Jerry is haranguing his client to get back on the ice pronto the kid flips him the bird. The next day Jerry issues an idealistic mission statement urging his firm to provide more service to fewer clients and accept lower profits. Within a week hes first fired then dumped by his fiancee and forced to revise if not invent his life. In this he has the support of Dorothy Boyd (captivating Renee Zellweger) an accountant so inspired by his vision that she quits the firm to be with him. A single mother with a 6-year-old son (Jonathan Lipnicki just about the cutest thing since dimples) she also has a romantic interest in her gorgeous new boss. And Jerry is lonely so the interest is mutual. The ensuing courtship however is blessedly unconventional as written and directed by Cameron Crowe of ""Say Anything"" and ""Singles."" Like his youth comedies his new film also boasts emotional complexities that are rare in the increasingly formulaic romantic genre. For one thing Jerrys life -- like most peoples -- isnt defined by one relationship. In addition to his evolving interest in Dorothy and her child hes also trying to manage his only remaining client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). A brassy wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals Rod pesters Jerry about the big bucks and the shoe commercials and Jerry goes to bat for him. Only this time hes determined to put his clients interests before his own. Gooding whose work was impressive but somber in ""Boyz N the Hood"" just about walks off with the movie with his ebullient grandstanding here. Like Jerry however hes also more than a mouthy athlete -- hes crazy in love with his fiercely devoted wife (Regina King). Bonnie Hunt adds a cynical note as the angelic Dorothys man-wary older sister. Cruise seems to have grown as much as Jerry for he brings gentleness warmth and lightheartedness to this role qualities that we havent seen since he played air guitar in his underpants in ""Risky Business"" 13 years ago. Come to think of it we havent seen his underpants in a while either. Jerry Maguire is rated R for language sex and nudity in a locker room scene.

"Jerry Maguire | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jerry-maguire ) Jerry Maguire (United States 1996) A movie review by James Berardinelli Every time I think Hollywood has slipped beyond redemption someone in the system produces a film like Jerry Maguire that renews my faith. Apparently creativity is not dead in the mainstream movie market -- not entirely at least. This is the kind of movie that reminds me why I started reviewing in the first place. Jerry Maguire is magic on celluloid -- fresh funny romantic and upbeat. Youll leave the theater with a smile on your face and perhaps a tear in your eye. Personally I never really bought Tom Cruise as the action lead in Mission Impossible. Here however the actor is playing to his strength which lies in an arena that demands less testosterone. Leave the stunts and explosions to Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Cruise is best when he stays low key and flashes the occasional smile. And in this picture surrounded by a superlative supporting cast his ability shines. Jerry Maguire works because we root for the title character and its Cruises performance that forges the link between his screen personae and the audience. As the movie opens super sports agent Jerry Maguire is facing a crisis of conscience (that he still possesses one after working in such a cynical materialistic business is something of a miracle). He wonders what he has become -- ""Just another shark in a suit?"" He realizes that he hates himself and his place in the world and laments that although he has a lot to say no one will listen. So late one night he writes a Mission Statement called ""The Things We Think and Do Not Say The Future of Our Business"". The essay attacks the sports agency business advocating a more humane approach. The next day a copy is distributed to everyone in the office. And although Jerrys co- workers applaud his courage (""Somebody finally said what had to be said"") his bosses are offended and he loses his job. Only one client unremarkable Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) elects to remain with Jerry as he strikes out on his own. Also joining him is a 26-year old single mother Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) who is so moved by Jerrys Mission Statement that shes willing to throw away a safe job to be part of his new venture. In an era of downsizing and force reductions its easy to understand what happens to Jerry. He speaks his mind crying out for compassion and caring only to be slapped down. He is branded as a loser because he dares to swim against the heartless prevalent business currents. Jerry finds himself in deep uncertain waters but his indefatigable spirit bolstered by tireless support from Rod and Dorothy helps him navigate the most dangerous eddys. Jerry Maguire is about redemption and love. Its about finding ones heart and soul in a business climate that attempts to rip both away. Writer/director Cameron Crowe who previously helmed Say Anything and Singles (in addition to scripting Fast Times at Ridgemont High) brings both a strong sense of verisimilitude and a lively wit to his film. Even as Jerry Maguire reaches out to the heart it tickles the funny bone. Not only does Crowe have a knack for creating multi-dimensional personalities for secondary characters with minimal screen time but he uses traditional formulas in unique ways to serve his themes. For example a common sports cliche is integrated into Jerry Maguire in such a way that it doesnt seem cheap or overdone. Its not the point of the movie; its just another piece in the overall puzzle. Cruise always a popular box-office draw shows why he got to the top. With a fine performance he forms the glue that holds the production together. Of course it helps that the cast includes three stupendous supporting actors not to mention a child performer (Jonathan Lipnicki playing Dorothys son) who threatens to steal several scenes on cuteness alone. Cuba Gooding Jr. who was excellent years ago in his Boyz N the Hood debut but hasnt done much since invests Rod with a remarkable level of energy and enthusiasm. And although his favorite phrase is ""Show me the money"" we recognize quickly that a love of family not greed is what motivates this athlete. Regina King (A Thin Line Between Love and Hate) is wonderful as Rods fanatically supportive wife. With a standout performance she transforms what could have been an minor role into something noteworthy. Then theres Renee Zellweger (The Whole Wide World) who will undoubtedly receive raves for her portrayal of Dorothy a determined woman following her own vision of the yellow brick road. Zellweger displays an appealing blend of strength and vulnerability and her chemistry with Cruise is nearly perfect. Their first romantic scene is charged with a playful but undeniable eroticism. If theres one downside to the actress appearance in Jerry Maguire its that shes not on screen enough. And even if Jerry isnt immediately smitten we are. While the budding romance between Jerry and Dorothy is Jerry Maguires most enchanting element the remainder of the film has the necessary appeal to keep our attention when Zellweger isnt around (Cruise on the other hand is in just about every scene). Crowe who doesnt have a subpar entry on his short resume has crafted another winner here. In fact with its attention to detail top-notch performances and universal themes Jerry Maguire marks his most successful movie to date. For anyone who has forgotten the feelings that a wonderful movie can trigger Jerry Maguire provides a welcome reminder.

Starring Tom Cruise  Renee Zellweger  Cuba Gooding Jr. and Bonnie Hunt. Directed by Cameron Crowe . (R. 135 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Tom Cruise plays jerks like no other big-name star. Its hardly surprising that he breathes fire into his latest role as a high-rolling sports agent in the wonderfully entertaining ""Jerry Maguire"" a romantic comedy opening today at Bay Area theaters. Sure its Cruise in another tightly wound macho part but there are surprises. ""Jerry Maguire"" is a savvy depiction of a punched-up egomaniac being mauled by the tender hands of love. Whats fascinating about Cruises snappy work is that through the entire movie he never really stops being a likable jerk -- even when he pretends or tries to be otherwise. Cruise hardly breaks swagger while all those about him are jumping through hoops to grow as people. That would include Maguires love interest Dorothy Boyd a 26-year-old single mom played by Renee Zellweger. She adds so much soul to this overlong comedy that shes the one viewers will think about afterward. Zellweger has the most interesting new face in film and she knows how to use silences to say what the heart wants to get across. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"") ""Jerry Maguire"" is filled with cogent observations on fast-lane wheeler- dealers how their need to score can fire up the imagination and corrupt it in equal measure. Smooth fast-talking and charming yet petrified about getting intimate with anyone Maguire is the top agent at Sports Management International. As a star in the meat market of buying and selling athletes Maguire is the tight end and the quarterback too. Hes rolling in dough and hes good-looking with a knockout fiancee in Avery Bishop (Kelly Preston) a publicist for the National Football League who is as facile in the bedroom as she is in the boardroom. But ""Jerry Maguire"" is one of those random-acts-of-something movies. The first one is a pang of conscience suffered by Jerry when he has an off night and sits down with his laptop to gather his manically disordered thoughts. The process turns into a confessional binge at the keyboard as he drafts a visionary soul-stirring ""mission statement"" suggesting that the army of hustling -- and conniving -- agents at SMI be less greedy and more caring about their clients. Maguire is cocky enough to turn his declaration into a memo to his colleagues -- a high-road tactic that gets him fired. Suddenly the most successful man in town is out of the very loop that he feeds on. The movie ought to sputter out here but Crowe and Cruise dont drop the ball. Maguire simply cant stop hustling -- the film is essentially a portrait of an addict even after he restarts his career as an independent with nobody on his team . . . well almost nobody. Theres something truly soulful in the way Dorothy a quiet nose- to-the-grindstone accountant at SMI stands up for Jerry in a halting oddly proud way. Shes got everything to lose so why does she risk it to follow the cad Jerry Maguire? Its another one of those random-acts things. Also siding with Jerry is a second-tier wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals named Rod Tidwell played by Cuba Gooding Jr. Hes so good in the part he keeps ""Jerry Maguire"" pumped up at sag point. Tidwell wants it all -- the stardom the outrageous millions in contracts and product endorsements. He seems like the ultimate egotistical jock. But here again ""Jerry Maguire"" has surprises in store by delving into wonderfully warm facets of a guy who on the surface is a turnoff. With the patina of a sports-insider film ""Jerry Maguire"" is an absorbing look at the sweaty passions and cold calculations that drive a business filled with speculators schmooze artists double dealers and the emotion-charged highs that a hot contract can produce. Cruise almost exhausts the character and his compulsive mannerisms. But ""Jerry Maguire"" is saved by its earthy women. Helping to shape Dorothy is her sister Laurel (Bonnie Hunts finest hour) a cynic with her heart on her sleeve. Tidwells wife Marcie (Regina King) is another character making key calls in the game plan. And just to make sure that women matter Crowe adds a circle of divorced women who meet at Laurels house to trash men. ""Jerry Maguire"" has another asset in 6-year-old Jonathan Lipnicki who makes his screen debut as Dorothys son Ray. Sign that cute kid up -- its time to replace Macaulay Culkin.

"WashingtonPost.com Jerry Maguire Comes On Strong Go to the ""Jerry Maguire"" Page Jerry Maguire Comes On Strong By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer December 13 1996 The word on ""Jerry Maguire"" at least from this corner is good real good in fact. But theres a qualifier. The movie like its effervescent star Tom Cruise starts out at a cracking pace. For the first hour producer-writer-director Cameron Crowes finely tuned comedy purrs with energy premium one-liners and well-charged character development. But as ""Maguire"" enters its second half it cant seem to leave well enough alone. The cuteness comedy and poignancy are revved into overdrive until the engine boils over. Where you stand on Hollywood hyperbole is going to determine how much this cloying development gets to you. One thing remains constant however Cruise control. As Jerry Maguire an obsessive slightly insincere sports agent dealing in a world of hype lies and other forms of negotiation he is a human Energizer Bunny. A blur of flailing arms raised fists high-fives and emcee finger pointing he seems to be powered by a nuclear dynamo. Whether you define Cruises performance as acting or thespian calisthenics its an impressive spectacle. We meet Maguire at the height of his arrogance. Working for the top-flight SMI (Sports Management International) agency his life is devoted to 72 superstar clients ranging from bull-necked football players to dainty gymnasts. Hes always wired always looking for the juiciest deal. But when one of his clients an ice hockey pro lies injured in a hospital and Maguire jocularly encourages him to rejoin the brutal fray the agent suffers a momentary pang of conscience. Writing up a touchy-feely memo advocating fewer clients and less money he impulsively circulates it among his colleagues. The Maguire manifesto which he instantly regrets writing causes his slimy boss Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) to fire him. Now alone which is his biggest fear Maguire makes an energetic bid to retain all of his clients. But he loses everyone except college football star Frank ""Cush"" Cushman (Jerry OConnell) and Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) a jive-talking wide receiver whos more obsessed with making millions than enjoying the game. He has one other ally The noble memorandum inspires Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) a meek accountant at SMI and a single mother to volunteer to work with him in his fledgling agency. When Maguire loses Cush a valuable client to his former agency and splits up with his over-ambitious fiancee (Kelly Preston) hes truly deserted. Maguires road to Hollywood redemption is a drawn-out affair. Heading toward a relationship with Dorothy and bonding with her precocious 6-year-old son Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki) he has to learn how to treat women right. He also has to do right by Tidwell now his sole bread and butter. Crowe who also directed ""Say Anything"" and ""Singles"" overloads the movie with pseudo profundities about love loyalty and other moral issues. He has a heavy hand when it comes to feel-good pandering too. Dorothys protective quippy sister (Bonnie Hunt) gets a little too wise and witty for her own good. Were hit over the head a thousand times about the passionate love between Tidwell and his hyper-devoted wife (Regina King) and what a lesson Maguire could learn from that relationship. As for the kid (who suggests a young Roger Ebert) hes directed to be sweet and charming at every possible opportunity. You may catch yourself muttering If that precious tot tries warming my heart one more time...."" But Cruise is at the top of his form and Gooding makes a brilliant opponent. Playfully challenging Cruise at every turn he forces him to get even better. When in a telephone conversation at the SMI office Maguire begs Tidwell to remain his client the black footballer swinging to the rhythm of a rap song at home demands a show of verbal enthusiasm. ""Show me the money"" shrieks Maguire repeating Tidwells specific instructions. ""I love black people"" he yells again turning scores of heads. Moments like these will bring down the house; and they give you just about enough juice to make it through the rest of the movie. JERRY MAGUIRE (R) -- Contains profanity and shadowy nudity.

In this freshly minted take on a spoiled yups fall and redemption Tom Cruise plays a high-powered sports agent Jerry Maguire who lives in a frenzy of dealmaking. Jerry works for SMI (Sports Management International) the sports equivalent of a Hollywood talent agency like CAA; his clients include the top stars of baseball football and basketball. In an age of global marketing the athletes are franchises grinning jock pashas who sell products by selling themselves. Jerry is the shark on the sidelines the guy with the cellular phone who turns a first-round draft choice into a multimillion-dollar endorsement industry. To Jerry everythings a commodity his clients his bitch-goddess NFL-publicist fiancee (Kelly Preston) his life. Hes on a merry-go-round that wont stop and Crowe whose previous films Say Anything... (1989) and Singles (1992) gazed with affection upon the romantic yearnings of a newly cooled-out generation here zigzags into denser faster more cynical terrain. For about 45 minutes Jerry Maguire is an explosion of media-age filmmaking energy. Whether Jerry is closing deals or flirting through his bachelor party (pretty much another deal) Crowe catches us up in the mad unreality of it all -- an adrenaline-capitalist high that just keeps feeding on itself. Jerry though isnt quite at home as master of the universe. Hes got everything but deep down he knows hes disconnected wedded to nothing but his own pitches. In a crisis of conscience he drafts a corporate ""mission statement"" advocating that SMI pay more attention to fewer clients (for less revenue). Does he realize its heresy? Unconsciously perhaps. Within days hes been fired tossed off the merry-go-round a dealmaker with no more deals to make. Jerry Maguire is the story of how Jerry cut loose from his identity gently stumbles into a new kind of life. For a while I expected a familiar sermon about a top gun who finds like his integrity man. After all how is Jerry going to satisfy his ego now? By writing fiction? Crowe however has something subtler in mind. Jerry still wants to be a sports agent. He just wants to slow down to reconnect with his clients -- with himself. Jerry Maguire doesnt have a conventional narrative drive and thats part of its charm; its a movie of quick feints and jabs. Jerry dumps his fiancee and sets up shop with Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) a single mother so inspired by his mission statement -- and his dimples -- that she quits her job as an SMI bookkeeper to go to work for him. Jerry likewise hangs on to just one client Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) an upstart wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals who stakes his shot at superstardom on Jerrys undivided loyalty. To be or not to be -- a human being that is. Thats the question that courses through nearly every scene of Jerry Maguire. Americas favorite star is still on smiling Cruise control but now he finesses it into a dance. He seduces -- then steps back; he turns on the charm -- then lets it slide into pools of doubt. Its Cruises deftest performance yet as a slickster grasping for the decency in himself. As Dorothy Renee Zellweger with her oval face and slightly daffy little-girl voice at first calls up images of a more petite Victoria Jackson but she grows on you. When she turns her imploring stare on Cruise she melts through his sheen the way Debra Winger melted through Richard Geres in An Officer and a Gentleman. One of the most likable things about Jerry Maguire is the way it keeps throwing you curves. Jerry and Dorothy get married but (small detail) he still has to fall in love with her. The biggest curve of all is Cuba Gooding Jr.s ferocious star-making performance as Rod the hot-dog rebel. Gooding so earnest in Boyz N the Hood here breaks loose into Ali-like flights of punchy combative eloquence. When he ""magically"" emerges from a mishap on the field his ebullient reaction -- fueled by the knowledge that now at last hell be ""shown"" the money -- calls up all the soulful real-world triumph the movie has been reaching for. Its truly a feel-great moment.
