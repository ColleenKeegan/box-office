Abigail Breslin the center handles title character with assurance in Kit Kittredge An American Girl. Photo CYLLA VON TIEDEMANN PICTUREHOUSE.WIREIMAGE.COM Kit Kittredge An American Girl 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Considering that the prime motive for making Kit Kittredge An American Girl was probably to sell more dolls this is a better film than one might expect. Based on an enormously popular line of toys and books that glorify young girls throughout our nations history it is not hard to understand why Depression-era Kit was chosen for this spinoff of Mattels first feature movie. Spunky 10-year-old Kit (Abigail Breslin the likable title character of Little Miss Sunshine) is mobilized to teach and learn a lesson in economics -- that even the middle class can be adversely affected by hard times. Implied but unspoken is how similar our current financial mess is to the woes of the 1930s. Like another chipper kid of the period Little Orphan Annie it is nearly impossible to keep optimistic Kit down. She is the daughter of a Cincinnati auto dealership owner (Chris ODonnell) and a stay-at-home garden-club mom (Julia Ormond) living a comfortable secure life even though her neighbors are losing their jobs and seeing their homes foreclosed upon. Then one day while doing a good deed passing out food at a soup kitchen she spots her father who has lost the dealership and will soon be forced to head off for Chicago in search of employment. And her mother will have to open their home to boarders. Not only to strangers but strange strangers. Trying to pitch in Kit pursues becoming a published writer for the city newspaper but the growling editor in chief (Wallace Shawn) is unsympathetic. Fortunately for her a rash of robberies breaks out affording her the opportunity to switch ambitions from junior Brenda Starr reporter to Nancy Drew sleuth. Only at the films end does the material succumb to its potential sugar overdose. Until then director Patricia Rozema (Mansfield Park) keeps matters in check aided by a far-better-than-expected supporting cast of boarders. They include a disapproving prude (Glenne Headley) a flirtatious dance instructor (Jane Krakowski) and particularly a ditsy librarian (Joan Cusack) and a cunning magician (Stanley Tucci). They should be enough to keep parents engaged throughout and Breslin handles the central character chores with her growing assurance. She looks able to sustain a film career for the long haul and as long as there are susceptible female tweens Kit Kittredge looks to have quite a future on the big screen as well.

""Kit"" is the enterprising girl-reporter-in-training poppet from 1934 Cincinnati who represents Depression-era America. So yes this movie is a slick marketing offshoot of an expensive toy. Ewww. But Kit Kittredge is also a smart playful informative pleasure in its own right -- a gently thoughtful audience-appropriate entertainment (directed by Mansfield Parks Patricia Rozema) that assembles swell actors to play colorful characters who dont shy away from depicting serious hard times. Little Miss Sunshines redoubtable Abigail Breslin is swellest of all in the title role believable (and admirable) as an unpretentious go-getter with an open mind; when not helping Mama (Julia Ormond) open their house to boarders she investigates a local crime. Others in the nabe include Max Thieriot as a hunky young hobo a perfectly cast Wallace Shawn as a newspaper editor and for screwball spin Stanley Tucci and Joan Cusack as a traveling magician and a motoring librarian. The latter is actually hell on wheels.

This StoryKit Doll With Moxie Puts a Happy Face on the DepressionBleak Past Catches Up To a Troubled PresentSummer Movie GuideFind Kit Kittredge ShowtimesView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Well why not? As everyone knows anything goes. The doll in question is a beloved artifact manufactured and sold by a subsidiary of Mattel under the rubric ""American Girl."" The dolls are linked to time and place with a wardrobe of appropriate accessories as a way of teaching girls the history of their own country primary school evidently having failed at this task utterly. The series has been extremely successful and this installment is the fourth though the first to get the big movie treatment with a theatrical release as opposed to a straight-to-TV destiny. Julia Roberts is the executive producer. The movie with this unusual pedigree is alas not unusual in the slightest. In fact it is so usual it deserves some kind of an award for obviousness as it telegraphs every development traffics in stereotypes and cliches and merrily appends 21st-century political correctness onto the 20th centurys hardest and grimiest decade. The tweener girls for whom it is aimed deserve better. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. It also re-creates a lost genre. The doll movie? ""Baby Doll""? ""Valley of the Dolls""? ""Guys and Dolls""? ""Dolly Parton in Concert?"" No the rooming house movie. You know like ""Miss Susie Slagles."" Youve never heard of ""Miss Susie Slagles""? My point exactly. That 1946 movie was med students boardinghouse Baltimore 1910 every guest a zany or a zinger. ""Kit Kittredge"" travelers boardinghouse Cincinnati 1934 every guest a zany or a zinger including . . . a guy with a monkey When it opens the Kittredges are solidly ensconced in their suburban home secure and warm and full of love for one another the comforting dwelling serving as a symbol of the solidity of their upper-middle-class life. Perky Kit (Abigail Breslin) is trying to ""break into print"" on the downtown Cincinnati Register but blowhard editor Mr. Gibson (Wallace Shawn) keeps rejecting her cute childs-eye view of the Worlds Fair. Breslin so wondrous and singular in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" now two years later seems sleek and well modulated a trained child actor not a real living hurting thing. She represents in case you are exceedingly dumb the American Girl virtues of spunk spirit pizzazz what have you; shes got spirit. Shes a durn spitfire. Yet compare her performance with a brilliant one of almost the same role and time -- Tatum ONeal in ""Paper Moon"" -- and you see what a standard little commercial item Breslins performance is. The issue of the first part of the film is watching the Depression -- first represented by scrawny hobos slouching along the street -- erode the sanctity of the Kittredges middle-class security. Dad (Chris ODonnell overmatched) loses his car dealership and cant find work; gradually the family makes the decision to take in boarders to sell eggs grow veggies to somehow get through it. Dad meanwhile like so many others hits the road looking for better times and places. In what seems like 10 minutes -- wait it is10 minutes -- Mom (the beautiful English actress Julia Ormond who looks like she could use Chris ODonnell for kindling) and the kid are sharing the abode with zanies wackos crazies and that guy with a monkey For Gods sake ladies and gentlemen can we not agree on one thing No more guys with monkeys The director Patricia Rozema has a rare talent She gets third-rate performances out of first-rate performers with almost startling efficiency. Besides the generic perkiness of Breslin such uniquely flavored performers as Glenne Headly Jane Krakowski Joan Cusack and Stanley Tucci have key roles. All are bland some hardly exist at all and as performance the whole thing seems a waste. The one element of which Rozema and the production team can be proud is the films art production though theres something quietly appalling about a self-consciously ""colorful"" Depression (again check the Depression in ""Paper Moon""). You sense the movie crew spending millions in clothes cars disguised building fronts and whole blocks of downtown Toronto shining up old streetcars and so forth and so on to make viewers think theyre in the middle of a massive economic dislocation but the images so squalor-free so sparkly with primary color so damned . . . spunky . . . make it seem more like a new Disney World neighborhood. Nowhere is this dishonesty by primary color more revolting than in the films evocation of a hobo jungle. Not a cesspool for despairing desperate men on the road hunted by cops and railroad bulls full of self-loathing and therefore truly dangerous looking for a Steinbeck to tell their epic story this place is presented as a cheery collectivist utopia where rosy-faced squeaky-clean toothsome bohemians merrily contribute each according to his talent to each according to his need. Its a leftist cuckoo fantasy straight out of Stalins Ministry of Culture in the actual year 1934 so obviously false it makes you feel like like youve been kidnapped by a ""Kumbaya"" chorus. In any event the utopian Hooverville is in service to the movies crackpot central thesis which is the fabulosity of the hobos (a.k.a. in our time the homeless) as opposed to the petty mean-spirited greed of those who try to cling to the middle class. This leads to a feeble creaky plot in which the rooming houses two pet noble hobos are accused of burglary so that it falls to Kit girl reporter and her fellow members in the Treehouse Club to prove their innocence. Anybody who cant see where its going should turn in his familys moviegoing permit to the Ministry of Culture and face immediate exile to the wastes beyond Lake Baikal. Your father Koba the Bear demands it of you Anyhow the movie itself is just like a doll. Bright and colorful it just lies there wrapped in plastic waxy skin eyes dead buttons staring into nothing.

(AP Photo/HBO Films amp; Picturehouse Cylla von Tiedemann)  NO SALES  Photo Cylla Von Tiedemann AP Movie review Little miss Kit Kittredge 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Kit KittredgeAn American Girl Family movie. Starring Abigail Breslin Joan Cusack Chris ODonnell Julia Ormond Stanley Tucci Wallace Shawn and Madison Davenport. Directed by Patricia Rozema. (G. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Movies have become adept at sneaking in product placements but ""Kit Kitt- redge An American Girl"" may be the first to blatantly shove one into its title. Shops named American Girl are sprinkled around the country stocked not only with dolls and matching elaborate wardrobes but also with historical novels starring Felicity Samantha Ruthie Kit and the others on display. Take that Barbie. Now Kit bursts out of her box and onto the big screen. The movie named for her is surprisingly solid and entertaining considering that it started life as a doll and mostly avoids the saccharine. With Abigail Breslin in the title role childlike exuberance is guaranteed. Much as she did in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Breslin imbues Kit with joy. Shes always bright-eyed and smiling overcoming her difficult circumstances. ""Kit Kittredge"" is set during the Great Depression but no one would call its 9-year-old heroine depressed. Foreclosure signs are posted in every direction from Kits house in a once-prosperous residential area of Cincinnati. (The parallel with today probably wasnt intended but will be noticed at least by older viewers.) These are hard times with dads losing their jobs and hoboes roaming neighborhoods in search of food. But it all appears to be shot through a golden filter that lets Breslins newly blond hair shine. Its like a Norman Rockwell version of the Depression. Kit starts out with little to worry about except whether the curmudgeonly editor (Wallace Shawn) of the local daily will publish one of her articles. She has a burning desire to be a newspaper reporter. But when her father (Chris ODonnell) loses his car dealership and abruptly leaves in search of work her coddled existence - along with its lofty ambitions for a 9-year-old - changes. Screenwriter Ann Peacock (""The Chronicles of Narnia"") artfully turns Kits plight into a really big adventure. Her mother (Julia Ormond) takes in boarders though not the ordinary kind. They include a magician a magicians assistant and a high-stepping dancer - the makings of an at-home Cirque du Soleil. Later valuables start to disappear and a couple of Kits hobo buddies are suspected. She sets out to find the real thieves. ""Kit Kittredge"" is proof of how far you can get with the right screenwriter - in this instance one versed in Childrens Adventures 101 - and director. Patricia Rozema brings the same air of romance she did to ""Mansfield Park."" Surprises pop up in the Kittredge lodgings. Peacock and Rozema understand the way children even precocious ones talk and act. It shows not just in Breslins winning performance but also in Madison Davenports as her best pal Ruthie. For many young ones in the audience this may be their first exposure to the Depression. Although the film frequently depicts it as fun - a sort of group grope where everybody holds everyone else up - it doesnt stint on depicting hobo parks of the time where those who rode freight trains went to relax and mooch on anything not nailed down. In the American Girl childrens stories Kit and Ruthie are always rooted in the Depression awakening from one Groundhog Day to the next. By fleshing them out the movie brings their circumstances closer to reality. It could prompt a discussion of the 1930s if a young moviegoers curiosity is piqued. This is a blessing considering how little there is to say after most kiddie flicks. The same care that went into hiring the filmmakers continued with the adult casting. Joan Cusack and Stanley Tucci go hilariously broad in their portrayal of two boarders with sketchy pasts. Cusack has a great rubbery face that draws laughs just from watching her contort it. Ormond and ODonnell are the weakest links. Such a drab couple could never have conceived a life force like Kit. -- Advisory Youngsters younger than 4 may be frightened by the hoboes and their park.

A series of stylized images sets the scene for you An upscale neighborhood of Cincinnati 1934. Picket fences and a series of majestic brick mansions line an idyllic shady lane. Residents are dressed in their finery women in floral dresses trimmed with ribbons and delicate little buttons men in fedoras and vests. Then along comes the counterpoint a couple of little-boy hobos in tatters and worn-through shoes. Ten-year-old Kit Kittredge played by the bright-eyed Abigail Breslin leads these unfortunate youth to her mother (played by a tearful Julia Ormond) whos in the midst of hosting a garden party. Despite the disapproving glances of her guests Mrs. Kittredge doesnt hesitate to offer the boys sandwiches and -- if they come back the next day -- paying work. Generosity open-mindedness These virtues appear to run in the Kittredge family. In addition the remarkable Kit possesses some singular traits Shes a spunky self-possessed girl capable of outsmarting grownups. In fact she longs to be a muckraking newspaper journalist -- aw how quaint -- and even has the verve to march into the office of Mr. Gibson (played by hilarious character actor Wallace Shawn) editor of the Cincinnati Register to pitch story ideas. But alas when Kits adoring father (hello handsome Chris ODonnell) loses his job at an auto dealership the girls charmed life comes crashing down. Dad departs for Chicago to look for work whereas mother and daughter are left no choice but to take in boarders. Soon the Kittredges labyrinthine house is overrun with oddballs a sexy dance instructor an uptight mother and her gentle son Stirling (newcomer Zach Mills) a mobile librarian a magician even a pet monkey. As if that werent enough those grimy little hobos Will (Max Thieriot) and Countee (Willow Smith) keep showing up for work. Of course these zany characters teach important lessons about the dangers of stereotyping -- but for adult viewers this aspect of the story comes off as a little too pat. KIT KITTREDGE AN AMERICAN GIRL  out of 4 stars Rated G. However when this G-rated movie confronts the Great Depressions effect on grade-schoolers its perspective feels childlike not for its simplicity but for its straightforwardness. Theres a heartbreaking thread about a childs desperate longing for an absent father and its the bravest most honest thing in here. So as it turns out ""Kit Kittredge"" doesnt at all pander to pint-sized doll aficionados. Rather the movie is smart empathetic fun loving and best of all a delight for all audiences.

"Kit Kittredge An American Girl (G)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Kit Kittredge An American Girl (G)  Girl series hits big screen in a big way. Abigail Breslin in a scene from ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" from HBO Films. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald Walking in to see Kit Kittredge An American Girl I was unaware the movie was spun off from a popular line of toy dolls -- more than 14 million of them have been sold. Nor did I know about the anticipation and excitement many little girls have for the movie which is the fourth in the series (the previous three made for TV are available on DVD). I still have no opinion on the toys but I can definitely vouch for the film living up to expectations. Shot with the burnished luxurious cinematography of a big-budget movie and cast with actors who never treat the material as if it were beneath them Kit Kittredge An American Girl is a thoroughly satisfying and engaging childrens picture that never forgets those kids probably didnt get to the theater by themselves. Director Patricia Rozema and screenwriter Ann Peacock avoid condescending to their target audience -- or for that matter to their adult guardians -- by treating their child protagonists with care and respect. It helps too that they have the amazing Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) in the lead role of 9-year-old Kit a bright and winsome girl in Depression-era Cincinnati who aspires to be a reporter for the Cincinnati Register. Kit is constantly submitting to the paper her stories such as a piece on the Worlds Fair without much luck. But as the Depression starts to affect the lives of her closest friends -- and then inevitably her own family -- Kits priorities change. Her father (Chris ODonnell) goes to Chicago to find work and promises to return but doesnt. Her mother (Julia Ormond) in a desperate attempt to save their home starts taking in boarders such as a traveling librarian (Joan Cusack) a magician (Stanley Tucci) and a fallen socialite (Glenn Headley) awaiting word from her own husband who has gone to New York in search of employment. The backdrop is grim and to its credit the movie does not sugarcoat its portrayal of how the Depression affected the day-to-day lives of upper middle-class Americans who lost everything in the span of a month and had to figure out how to push forward. The filmmakers allow the story to unfold entirely through the point of view of Kit who may not fully understand the severity of the situation but is also more aware and resourceful than the adults around her realize. Kit Kittredge An American Girl sends its heroine and her friends on several adventures including a Nancy Drew-ish one involving some stolen valuables but its the movies overall tone -- the innocence of children as well as their surprising resiliency -- that elevates the film into something far more valuable than a feature-length commercial for toys.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED June 30 2008 at 113 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 1007 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive linemen can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" is rife with feisty generous pleasures. Abigail Breslin stars as Kit a 9-year-old living observing and typing furiously during the early 1930s. This Cincinnati kid aches to become a reporter. She bursts into the offices of the The Register articles in hand. The papers editor (played with snarl not bite by Wallace Shawn) isnt ready to hire a pint-size freelancer even one with the instincts and energy of Rosa- lind Russells Hildy Johnson. The Depression changes the wealth of a nation and hobbles the lives of those closest to home. And in the spirit of ""write what you know"" Kit hits the typewriter. Those familiar with Kit and the American Girl dolls and their well-researched tales should be pleased with this outing. Those with little knowledge of the multimillion-dollar toy-book-magazine empire that speaks to young girls dont be deterred. Director Patricia Rozema and writer Ann Peacock pull off something nuanced and wonderful. ""Kit Kittredge"" stays planted in Kit and her friends world. Yet like its protagonist the movie pays sharp heed to its era. The back-and- forth between childhood hope and grown-up challenges is seamless. This is a movie of secret oaths and treehouses. These arent lost as the hardships come. But they are changed. And Kit and her cohorts rise to the occasion. Kits father Mr. Kittredge (Chris ODonnell) loses his job at a car dealership and must travel to Chicago in search of work. ODonnell gives a nice tone-setting talk to Kit before leaving in search of a job. Kits mother takes in boarders in hopes of avoiding the fate of neighbors and friends foreclosure. A cast of ace performers make up the whimsical collection of characters that reside in the Kittredge home. Stanley Tucci plays a magician who performs illusions in the backyard. Joan Cusack is the zany mobile librarian Miss Bond. Jane Krakowski kicks up her heels as a dance instructor. Glenne Headly and Zach Mills settle in as Mrs. Howard and son Stirling reduced to a dramatically different life because Mr. Howard has also gone looking for work. As Mrs. Kittredge Julia Ormond is one of the chief reasons this bright film has such grace. Hosting an afternoon tea before her own circumstances change Mrs. Kittredge turns to greet two young ""hobos"" looking to barter labor for food. The look of compassion on her face sets the tone. Parables of kindness are always welcome. A powerful lesson comes by way of the two orphans Will Shepherd and his wee charge Countee played by Max Thierot and Willow Smith. (Theres something sweet about Will Smiths daughter going up against her dad at the box office today.) A series of crimes is blamed on the ""hobos"" whose population grows as the economy dives. Rozema isnt afraid to introduce sorrow and need into the frame. Will and Countee give Kit and friends a tour of the hobo encampment they live in. The images pay homage to Dorothea Langes striking portraits from the Depression. ""Kit Kittredge"" isnt haunting in the way of John Fords ""Grapes of Wrath"" the film that introduced this movie- watcher to the Depression. Rozema and her spry cast prove that they dont have to haunt in order to involve youngsters and adults in a rich tale of adversity hope and yes gumption. ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" G. 1 hour 40 minutes. Directed by Patrica Rozema; written by Ann Peacock; based on the stories by Valerie Tripp; starring Abigail Breslin Joan Cusack Madison Davenport Glenne Headly Jane Krakowski Zach Mills Colin Mochrie Chris ODonnell Julia Ormond Stanley Tucci Wallace Shawn Max Thierot Willow Smith.

(CYLLA VON TIEDEMANN/PICTUREHOUSE.WIREIMAGE.COM) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / July 2 2008 Set in 1934 ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" hearkens back to a time when pop standards like ""Paper Moon"" burbled on the radio people used manual typewriters and a child could actually envision a viable career in newspapers. Its a soothing fantasy in 2008 - except for the home foreclosures and the parents losing their jobs. Maybe things havent changed that much.The movie adapted from Valerie Tripps series of short books and starring Abigail Breslin is the first big-screen brand extension of the popular ""American Girl"" line of dolls and period accessories. The overall marketing concept is genius really - the dolls sell American values from a time before everything in America was for sale - but the individual products are mostly inviting and intelligent. They function as counterprogramming to our modern kid culture a safe haven from booty-calls and belly-shirts.As such I expect ""Kit Kittredge"" will be embraced by nervous moms hoping to divert their daughters from the ticket line for ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan."" The good news is that their daughters will thank them as will sisters grandmothers aunts and any stray brothers or fathers dragged along. The film is warm and foursquare pleasingly honest about its timeworn emotions. The Great Depression it shows us is sugar-coated but only mildly so which is to say its seen through the clear optimistic eyes of a 10-year-old.And Breslin has a lovely matter-of-factness that smacks of gingham and Ovaltine - shes a real girl even under the blond wig. The film begins in sunny confidence Dad (Chris ODonnell) still has his auto dealership in downtown Cincinnati and Mom (Julia Ormond) gently but righteously defends hobos from the wrath of garden-club ladies. Kit simply wants to be the best kid reporter in town even if the papers crusty editor (Wallace Shawn) wont read her copy.Weve seen her friends weeping in terror as the sheriff tosses them from their homes though. Then Dads dealership goes bust and he disappears to Chicago to find work; Mom is forced to take in boarders. Kit lives in a panic shell sink to selling eggs and wearing dresses made from grain bags; as the Depression slowly grinds on both fears will be realized.""Kit Kittredge"" reminds its audience that such small vain worries mean little in the context of national upheaval and it soothes us with the notion that community heals all. The boarders and a nearby hobo camp become part of Kits extended family; not everyones good but nearly everyone wants to be.Director Patricia Rozema (she had the art house hit ""Ive Heard the Mermaids Singing"" back in the late 80s) has the fortune to have a roster of fine character actors all trying to upstage each other as the boarders Stanley Tucci as an itinerant magician Joan Cusack as a dithery librarian Glenne Headley raising her pinkie as a prissy mom to Kits jug-eared friend Stirling (Zach Mills).Jane Krakowski undulates adorably as another boarder and theres Max Theriot as a soft-focus but decent hobo boy who teaches the kids how to read tramp signs. Ormond is a mother out of a 1940s MGM classic wise and gentle with the strain of keeping the worlds horrors from her child visible only in her eyes.The period ambience comforting yet urgent is the best part of ""Kit Kittredge"" - that and Breslin who never once gets actressy - so your heart sinks a bit when a mystery subplot heaves into view and the movie goes off on a ""Home Alone""-style catch-the-thieves tangent.Kids will enjoy these scenes but theyll also recognize how over-familiar they are whereas the rest of the film is so old-fashioned and plainspoken as to feel brand new. Theres nothing remotely cool about ""Kit Kittredge."" Thats why its cool.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/movienation.

It smacks of rampant greed nothing more than big-screen product placement designed to rope even more girls into buying even more products (or more likely to talk their parents into it). Yet Kit Kittredge An American Girl isnt like that at all. Instead this tale of a little girls determination and grit during the Depression is an honest-to-goodness family movie one that parents and children can enjoy equally and together. While its unashamedly sweet its never cloying; director Patricia Rozema doesnt skimp on human tragedy. Its an irony-free throwback in that the children arent smart-mouthed brats engaged in a constant battle to upbraid and belittle their parents siblings and friends - in other words its not a screechy Disney Channel sitcom but a fleshed-out film that parents can watch without wincing. Kit Kittredge for the uninitiated is one in the line of American Girl dolls. Each comes with its own book that tells its story set in different eras. Kit grew up during the Depression in both the book and the film. Here shes played by the always-charming Abigail Breslin with no small amount of spunk. (She looks exactly like the doll by the way.) While some families are starting to struggle in her hometown of Cincinnati Kits father (Chris ODonnell) still has his car dealership. Times are tough but Kits world is bright. But when she volunteers along with her class at the soup kitchen Kits world changes forever. Soon her father is off to Chicago looking for work. Kit and her mother (Julia Ormond) take in boarders to help make ends meet while rich Uncle Hendrick (Kenneth Welsh) keeps a disapproving eye on them from time to time. Kit is afraid and rightly so. In uncertain economic times the very real threat of losing ones home or livelihood is especially relevant giving the movie an immediacy beyond a mere period piece. Its an entertaining cast of characters who take rooms in the Kittredge household Miss Bond (Joan Cusack) the mobile librarian; magician Jefferson Berk (Stanley Tucci); uptight Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) and her son and Kits classmate Stirling (Zach Mills); and free-spirited Miss Dooley (Jane Krakowski) on the hunt for a husband. Kit also has friends who live in the hobo camp. One Will (Max Thieriot) will eventually find himself in need of Kits help and wits. She wants to write stories about a kids view of the camps for the newspaper - Wallace Shawn is a steam-coming-out-of-the-ears delight as her would-be editor - and her investigative skills serve her well. The mystery is tied up in rather clunky fashion and yes resolving crucial elements of the story during Thanksgiving dinner errs on the sentimental side. So what? By that time the audience will find the Kittredge home as welcome as the boarders do. We get to know the characters as they get to know each other - warily at first but eventually a bond forms. Theyre in this together by necessity pulling together (most of them anyway). In Breslins hands Kits attitude and resolve are winning. Kit Kittredge An American Girl is both enjoyable and necessary. At a time when children are growing up too fast busily text-messaging their third-grade friends about the latest Hannah Montana gossip its a rare treat to see a film in which kids are kids and happy to be so.

Comments click to enlarge Kit Kittredge An American Girl Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Rated G  2008 The publishing and merchandising phenomenon American Girl makes its way to the big screen with this handsome production starring Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) as a plucky tweener in Depression-era Cincinnati who longs to be a reporter. When her dad (played by a solid Chris ODonnell) loses his car dealership and must head to Chicago to find work she swallows her fear and rallies behind her mother (Julia Ormond) and their new boarders. A crime wave gives the heroine a mystery to solve and provides most of the comedy but the film is stronger in its dramatic stretches. The edifying lesson--that helping others brings out the best in us--should sit well with everyone. Patricia Rozema (Mansfield Park) directed. With Stanley Tucci Joan Cusack and Wallace Shawn.

Its not only fresh and unassuming but a film that serves very nicely the severely underserved audience of young girls. ENLARGE Abigail Breslin who won an Oscar nomination for her performance in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" plays the title role a 10-year-old who bless her heart and her Royal portable typewriter is determined to become a newspaper reporter. The story is set in Cincinnati in 1934 during the Depression when electronic journalism wasnt much of an option; no one but the radio commentator H.V. Kaltenborn wanted to be H.V. Kaltenborn. Kits father played by Chris ODonnell is a car dealer and her mother (Julia Ormond) is a lady of some leisure serving lunch in the backyard for members of her garden club most of whom wear floral prints. All of that changes though when Dads dealership goes bust and he leaves town in search of a job and Mom turns the family home into a boarding house for a collection of picturesque -- insistently picturesque -- characters. They include Joan Cusacks Miss Bond a mobile librarian who keeps bumping into things with her library truck and Stanley Tuccis Jefferson J. Berk a self-enchanted magician who levitates Miss Bond. This is the first theatrical feature film based on the American Girl line of dolls and the American Girl books. (Patricia Rozema directed Ann Peacock adapted Valerie Tripps book and David Boyd did the lovely cinematography.) As a piece of Americana its more Norman Rockwell than Dorothea Lange. The Depression has been cleansed of its most depressing aspects. Even a hobo jungle looks like a place where honesty and kindness trump bad luck. As a piece of filmmaking its less levitated than planted on uneven ground. For all its imperfections though ""Kit Kittredge"" looks awfully good when measured against the cynical slops being shoveled to mass audiences this summer. The film does deal with poverty in its earnest fashion and Kit is a worthy proto-feminist role model. She becomes a detective when justice requires it -- hobos have been blamed unfairly for a crime wave -- and breaks into public print despite the deep doubts of Wallace Shawns charmingly crusty Mr. Gibson an editor who makes his free-lancers earn their penny per word. All of this works as pleasantly as it does because the star carries the event-stuffed story with unflagging grace. Two years ago as Olive in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Abigail Breslin was chubby wide-eyed and endearing. Earlier this year a tawdry studio comedy called ""Definitely Maybe"" turned her into a lip-glossed pre-teen who learns about her fathers romantic entanglements. In ""Kit Kittredge"" shes neither chubby nor sexualized but a comely young actress playing a smart pretty girl. Whats unchanged from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is her sweet radiance. She seems delighted by life. ENLARGE A scene from My Winnipeg IFC Films My Winnipeg Until now Guy Maddins films have been an acquired taste I couldnt manage to acquire. Theyre surreal eccentric poetic and graphically striking in their intentionally crude soft-focus evocation of the silent era and the agitprop form. But ""My Winnipeg"" breaks through to something else. This autobiographical meditation is seductively funny as well as deliciously strange and hauntingly beautiful as well as stream-of-consciousness cockeyed. And the film succeeds partly thanks to rather than in spite of its swirling mostly black-and-white images that might have been downloaded from a fevered dream. Winnipeg is where Mr. Maddin has lived his whole life. In the films dream logic its the city and the life he must explore before being able to escape. ""What if I film my way out of here?"" he asks in a faux-naif voice-over. ""Its time for extreme measures."" To that end he uses actors to re-enact scenes from his childhood -- the acting is implacably bad but mysteriously affecting -- and home movies and snapshots that may or may not be authentic. The filmmaker dwells obsessively almost deliriously on Winnipegs twin distinctions the snow and the cold. (Snow falls on the actor playing him even when hes nodding off in a seat on a train.) His narration is as witty in its mock-epic way as the late-night free-form radio broadcasts that Jean Shepherd used to do many decades ago at KYW in Philadelphia. Yet the incantatory words play second fiddle to the moving pictures -- of Winnipegs vast fogbound train yards moldering arena and silhouetted sleepwalkers who carry the keys to all their old addresses as they like Guy Maddin search the city for fugitive memories. ""My Winnipeg"" is not your standard multiplex flick -- a childhood Chihuahua is played by a pug for Petes sake -- but given the prevailing standard thats all to the good. ENLARGE Steve Carell in Get Smart Warner Bros. Pictures Get Smart Rather than the laugh a minute promised by old comedies ""Get Smart"" generates approximately one laugh per hour and I cant remember either one. True to the TV series that spawned it the production looks cheerfully tacky but all other traces of cheer let alone sophistication have been expunged. Steve Carell in the role created by Don Adams is the bumbling agent Maxwell Smart and Anne Hathaway is in for Barbara Feldon as Agent 99. Never mind that hes 20 years her senior an age difference that extinguishes hints of romance. Her performance is shrill and he looks rueful when he isnt downright glum. (See a clip from the film.) ENLARGE Mike Myers in The Love Guru Paramount Pictures The Love Guru Compared to ""The Love Guru"" ""Get Smart"" is ""Citizen Kane."" Mike Myers as a blissed-out self-help charlatan named Guru Pitka gets to ride a bejeweled elephant and an electric carpet and talk with a funny Indian accent. But his character and a ramshackle plot about a lovelorn hockey star (played by Romany Malco) are only crude pretexts for crotch humor toilet humor sexual outuendo and a merciless succession of scenes involving flatulence urination and a dislikable dwarf. This from Paramount the studio of Cecil B. DeMille W.C. Fields ""Sunset Boulevard"" ""Rear Window"" ""Psycho"" and the road pictures of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. The road taken by ""The Love Guru"" could hardly be lower and leads nowhere. ENLARGE Photofest DVD Tip This isnt a pick but a plea to Universal Studios. Please oh please release ""King of the Hill"" on DVD. Not the TV series which is widely available but the 1993 film directed by Steven Soderbergh with Jesse Bradford as a resourceful boy left to his resources in Depression-era St. Louis. Its one of the best coming-of-age films ever made.

This sweetly enjoyable family film stars the endearing Abigail Breslin as Kit. And refreshingly its actually about something -- the Great Depression -- and tackles such serious issues as prejudice poverty and homelessness. PREMIERE A night out with the Kit Kittredge cult CLIP Catch a preview of Kit Kittredge But even as serious topics are interspersed throughout the story the film manages to be light and charming but never didactic. Much of the credit goes to the casting. Breslin is a bona-fide talent whether warming our hearts as a bespectacled pageant participant in Little Miss Sunshine or winning our admiration as the plucky Kit a wannabe reporter. Stanley Tucci Joan Cusack and Jane Krakowski bring dramatic heft to a tale that could have been paper-thin. Based on the series of American Girl stories by Valerie Tripp Kit is resourceful inquisitive and compassionate. Her sunny childhood takes a sudden turn compelling her to learn valuable lessons. Its 1934 and the Depression is clamping down on everyone in Kits hometown Cincinnati. Her father (Chris ODonnell) loses his car dealership and is forced to leave town to look for work. Kit and her mother (Julia Ormond) are forced to take in boarders and sell eggs to make ends meet. The boarders include an eccentric librarian (Cusack) a magician (Tucci) and a husband-hunting dance instructor (Krakowski). Kit befriends the boarders as well as a pair of orphaned boys who make their home in the ""hobo jungle"" on the outskirts of the city. When one of the boys is implicated in a string of robberies Kit becomes almost a junior Nancy Drew in her determination to solve the mystery of the stolen goods. She also dreams of being a journalist and marches into the office of a newspaper editor (Wallace Shawn) presenting her articles on a childs view of the Depression and the hobo camp. Though predictable and unabashedly sentimental the film is a warmly appealing tale of a bright girl bravely navigating tough times. What a pleasure to watch a movie aimed at girls that forgoes the requisite fashion modeling/shopping montage. Parents will find an enjoyable summer movie minus the materialistic kids and bathroom humor that too often make their way into family films.

Click for photos from the films premiere. Elizabeth Weitzman Friday June 20 2008 331 PM Those whove jostled their way through a crowded American Girl store will be relieved to know the first big-screen feature from the AG franchise is likely to be a more rewarding experience -- not to mention easier on the wallet. As any young fan can tell you Kit Kittredge is the aspiring reporter of the historical series and the star of several AG books already. As played by a charmingly no-nonsense Abigail Breslin Kit is a little girl with big ambitions living in 1934 Cincinnati. The editor at the local paper (Wallace Shawn) rejects her first story but not before mentioning that freelancers make a penny a word. Thats pretty strong motivation since Kits family has been hit hard by the Depression.Her father (Chris ODonnell) is away looking for work so Kit and her mother (Julia Ormond) have had to take in boarders. Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) is a grouch but Mr. Berk (Stanley Tucci) entertains everyone with magic tricks Miss Bond (Joan Cusack) always has an extra book to lend and Miss Dooley (Jane Krakowski) knows all the latest dance steps. So at the very least Kit considers herself better off than many of her friends who have nowhere to live. She feels especially lucky compared to Will (Max Thieriot) and Countee (Willow Smith) the homeless children her mother hires to help around the house. When theres a robbery the boarders instantly suspect these two little ""hobos."" So Kit must put her journalistic skills to work and get to the bottom of the story.Its certainly been a while since weve seen a movie this resolutely old-fashioned. But while the script feels a little stiff and moralistic at times its hard to fault a film with such an intelligent good-hearted heroine. Besides the target audience has already accepted the earnestly wholesome tone of the American Girl tales. And if they like Kits books you can bet theyll be happy to see her on the big screen.

By Peter Rainer June 21 2008 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Given its provenance ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" directed by Patricia Rozema and written by Ann Peacock is a much better movie than you might expect. The first feature film based on the highly popular American Girl book series - there have already been three made-for-television American Girl movies - plays out like a sweet-souled Nancy Drew mystery.Abigail Breslin plays Kit whose derring-do rescues her familys home from foreclosure. The quaintness of the Cincinnati locale is blessedly unsugary. The filmmakers understand that although this is the Depression as seen through the eyes of a spunky young girl it is still the Depression.The cast is remarkably good. Breslin has overdone her welcome for me a bit since her ""Little Miss Sunshine"" days but the movie also prominently features Stanley Tucci as a shady magician Wallace Shawn as the crustiest of crusty newspaper editors Julia Ormond as Kits mother and the always marvelous Joan Cusack as a mobile librarian. (Her mobile facial features are the films comic high points.) Preteen girls - and not just those who are already American Girl fanatics - should be entranced. And why not? Not many movies for that audience are as respectful as is this one. Grade A- (Rated G.)

Plucky likable and determined to succeed much like its heroine ""Kit Kittredge An American Girl"" is a throwback to the kinds of movies they dont make anymore. Anchored by a fine performance from Abigail Breslin this wholesome engaging entertainment offers something for viewers ages 7 to 107 and given the popularity of the ""American Girl"" brand should be an especially hot-ticket item for elementary- and middle-school girls. A platform release should benefit from positive word of mouth among ""Kits"" target demo and just as importantly the target demos moms yielding strong returns. That theres been a dearth of intelligent appealing live-action movies directed at girls should surprise no one. Into the breach steps ""Kit Kittredge"" the first ""American Girl"" theatrical feature (and the fourth filmed adaptation following WB telepics ""Felicity An American Girl Adventure"" ""Samantha An American Girl Holiday"" and ""Molly An American Girl on the Home Front""). By way of background Wisconsin-based ""American Girl"" (founded in 1986) is a line of dolls books and accessories notable for their historical accuracy. Each character hails from a different period and thus grapples with a period-appropriate challenge in her respective book series gleaning valuable life lessons as she struggles to prevail. The story unfolds in Cincinnati circa 1934 with 10-year-old Kit (Breslin) about to see the effects of the Great Depression firsthand. Kits brisk voiceover establishes that her dad Jack (Chris ODonnell) has a car dealership her mom Margaret (Julia Ormond) has a garden club and her older brother is away. Keenly observant (and a remarkably good typist) Kit aspires to be a reporter and visits the Cincinnati Register hoping to pitch a story on the Chicago Worlds Fair to hard-nosed fast-talking editor Mr. Gibson (Wallace Shawn). ""Get lost kid"" is the gist of his response. The sudden appearance of a foreclosure sign next door an encounter with a pair of hobos and spirited classroom debates begin to change Kits sense of her world often glimpsed safely from the treehouse in her front yard. But nothing prepares her for the moment she discovers her own father has joined the ranks of the newly unemployed. Played without dialogue its a beautifully restrained scene of mutual realization and tacit shame. When Jack heads for Chicago to find work Margaret takes on boarders to make ends meet. A socially diverse community of shared financial distress the Kittredge boarding house includes coquettish dance instructor Miss Dooley (Jane Krakowski); daffy mobile librarian Miss Bond (Joan Cusack); clever illusionist Mr. Berk (Stanley Tucci); and the reserved Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) and her 9-year-old son Stirling (Zach Mills). The friendly young hobos Will (Max Thieriot) and Countee (Willow Smith) do repairs on the Kittredge property in exchange for food. For her next pitch to the Register Kit decides to track Will and Countee for a day and learns about riding the rails the pictograph-specific hobo language and life inside a ""hobo jungle"" or tent village. All of this is both engaging and well elucidated. Beyond that though the story feels remarkably current; the era and specifics may be different but the climate of economic anxiety is something to which contempo American audiences can easily relate. Mr. Gibson has no interest in a piece about kindly hobos especially because they are presumed responsible for a rash of robberies in the Midwest. When these suspicions rear their head at home Kit sets out to unravel a mystery -- and she does although the very last scene is a hair too treacly and forced. Helmer Patricia Rozema (""Mansfield Park"") does an excellent job navigating the films tonal shifts incorporating comedy tragedy and a suspenseful denouement with equal grace. Tech contributions are strong especially David Boyds sepia-inflected lensing and Peter Coscos down-to-the-last-1930s-detail production design Equally creditable is Joseph Vitarellis score which is seamlessly interwoven with well-chosen standards from the era including ""Dont Fence Me In"" and ""Its Only a Paper Moon."" Breslin provides not only marquee value but also welcome spunk and tenacity (if only her stiff blonde wig were as lively as she is -- its the one prop that seems wholly fake). In a performance without vanity (and with virtually no makeup) Ormond has never been better. Supporting cast is also fine though Cusacks ditsy librarian will resonate better with kids than with adults. And Shawns casting as the salty editor will come as a delicious inside joke to those who fondly remember his father Williams tenure at the New Yorker.
