Maybe fresh isnt the right word. Artistic crises monied folk metropolitan settings romantic hiccups women holding back men or vice versa - we know what to expect from Allen who turned 75 last year. The biggest surprise these days is where the director of Annie Hall and Vicky Cristina Barcelona will take his travelling company next.For Midnight in Paris he opts for the French capital for the second time following Everyone Says I Love You and sets it mostly in the present but with some mischievous hops to the city in the 1920s and the 1890s. Its a simple amusing moral yarn with the odd hint of Allens comic anarchism of old. Its familiar but breezily so and the cast appear much more at ease than the recent You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger. Owen Wilson especially makes a charming laidback Allen alter ego.Midnight in Paris is a love letter to a city and like Manhattan opens with an adoring montage set to jazz of the city by day and night. As in so many of Allens films our troubled hero is a writer Gil (Wilson who adopts the classic slacks-and-check-shirt Woody look) is on holiday in Paris with his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her rich conservative parents. While Inez prefers the company of her folks or her friends Paul (Michael Sheen) a preening academic and his wife Carol (Nina Arianda) Gil is struggling to complete a book he hopes will mark his crossover from Hollywood hack to novelist and wanders the street by night looking for inspiration.Its on those journeys  that he finds himself by way of hitching a lift in a classic Peugeot in a Paris of another age mixing in the 1920s with the likes of Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll). It sounds crazy but the boldness of Gils late-night trips to the past give the film a lift out of the more tired arena of Gils romantic and creative crises in the present. Allen and his cast get the tone right the actors playing the historical characters with a spirited comic energy and Wilson well suited to the role of the doe-eyed bemused writer wallowing in his cultural heaven. Marion Cotillard and Lea Seydoux offer pretty but passive support as Gils alternative romantic options in the past and present while Carla Bruni has a shaky cameo as a tour guide.There are ideas afoot about idolising past cultural figures and falsely imagining golden ages but Gils line Im having an insight now its a minor one best sums up the films simple but honest vision. Allen aims for mild surprise and amusement rather than anything more heady. Its all very recognisable but not tired and the films lightly-played time-travelling element gives Midnight in Paris a hint of boldness lacking in too many of Allens recent films. Its fun and its most welcome.

Mediocre acting and weakish screenplay are offset by beautiful evocations of Paris as a romantic city making a quite passable movie experience and much better than the dreadful Vicky Christina Barcelona; choice of music is fine and well integrated as well.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 9 2012pumpyinaboxFeaturedAfter hearing so many good things about this film I couldnt believe my eyes and ears - its one of the worst films Ive ever seen. Im glad to see that others share my view. Woody Allen strikes out a lot and this was definitely a strike out. One of his worst.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 20 2012wildkatwriterFeaturedI have a theory about this film. Woody Allen wrote the script when he was about 15 and had just discovered these literary artistic and cinematic greats. And instead of re-reading it when he was 18 realising that it stank to high heaven and burning it hes made it into a move and inflicted it on all of us. Either that or aliens have stolen his brain and hes forgotten how to write movies. Because lets face it this is HORRIBLE. Shallow self-indulgent sycophantic misogynist pretentious crap. By the time Owen Wilsons struggling writer has wittered about Paris and how lovely it is for five minutes I wanted to punch him in the face but I realised hes meant to be the hero and were actually meant to CARE about whether he succeeds in his quest to stop being a Hollywood hack (biting the hand that feeds you there Woody) and become a proper writer and find a woman who admires him and presumably doesnt answer back. It has nothing to say about the luminaries it wheels on - they all just do a turn. Heminways intense Zeda F is a flake Scott Fitzgerald is a nonentity (noooo) Gertrude Stein is forthright Picasso does weird paintings and so on. Its one of two fanboy movies this year (the other was the much more bearable MY WEEK WITH MARILYN). This has lots of text and no subtext no subtlety and - tragic for the master of comedies of manners - no humour thats not heavy-handed. Its a film about Paris like NOTTING HILL is a film about London - there is the tourist Paris where all streets are cobbled all roads lead to the Seine or have a view of the Eiffel Tower and there is nobody who isnt white. And okay we writers all fantasise about our literary hero/ine sitting us down and saying ""This novel of yours its really promising Youve really got something there..."" but we dont actually put that scene in a sodding FILM and expect people to pay money to watch it. Owen Wilsons a good comic actor but here hes playing Woodys avatar and does Woodys voice spot-on - just enough to be really really annoying. Do yourself a favour read TENDER IS THE NIGHT or THE FIRST FORTY-NINE and give this film a very wide berth. Adolescent rubbish written by a 75-year old who should be old enough to know betterHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 29 2011EeyoreFeaturedSo desperately bad I considered walking out - and then at the end wished that I had. Its sad to see Allen degenerating into such over-sentimentalised tosh. Hackneyed locations cardboard cutout characters and unsympathetic ultra-rich and ultra-stupid principles do not make a good film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 22 2011RonanFeaturedOne of the worst movies Ive ever seen.

What starts as an amiable enough homage to Paris soon degenerates into a crass infantile time travel caper with the main character Gil transported back to the roaring 20s in the back of an old Peugeot. There he encounters the full list of literary and artistic luminaries of the day Fitzgerald Dali Hemingway etc. Wuite how they all came to be in exactly the same place at the same time and how they readily accept him into their circle (despite his modern clothes and mannerisms) are breesily sidestepped. The clumsy 1890s scene looked like it had been tacked on after the director realised he couldnt fit Toulouse Lautrec into the 1920s (as he was inconveniently dead by then) Meanwhile back in modern day Paris Gils intensly irritating future in-laws and airhead fiancee are swanning around the city flashing their cash (buying quaint 18000 wooden chairs) and talking loudly to ingratiating locals in English (""have the house detective come to my room immediately""). The bearded academic friend of the fiancee is just too pretentious for words and what on Earth Carla Bruni was doing masquerading as a tour guide at Musee Rodin is beyond me. Woody Allen is capable of much better than this inane tripe which is obviously intended for affluent gushing American tourists visitng Paris. As for time-travel capers - Bill and Ted did it so much betterHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreSep 15 2011FilmFanFeaturedOne of Woody Allens best films ever as far as I am concerned a great treat indeed for his many loyal fans on the European continent.

This is another average Allen film. Adrien Brody steals the movie with his one scene. Rachel Mcadams really should stop trying to act she is just not comfortable to watch and should invest in some Alexander technique.

Its a warm gently funny film with a cast who has got to grips with the tone of the script - other actors great ones seemed to really struggle with You will meet a tall dark stranger and Match Point (which I liked too but were very wooden in parts).

Those who stuck with Allen through the personal indiscretions and professional missteps of the previous decade can celebrate with the bubbly ""Midnight in Paris."" It offers both a reasonable return to form and a fresh setting for Allens brand of romantic comedy.The place is Paris whose postcard sites are served to us on an appetizer platter the way Allen used to proffer the New York skyline. The Allen surrogate singing this rhapsodie en bleu is Owen Wilson as Gil a frustrated Hollywood hack who is finally visiting the city of his dreams.Gil would love to move to a garret on the Left Bank and write a great novel while his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) would love to move to a wealthy American suburb like the one where she grew up. But her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) are temporarily in Paris and so is her pretentious ex-beau Paul (Michael Sheen channeling Michael Murphy from ""Manhattan"") so Inez keeps herself busy while Gil goes out to soak up the rain and inspiration. At midnight in Montmartre a vintage limousine stops near Gil and the gin-swilling occupants wave him inside. Theyre Americans named Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Allison Pill) and if they look as if theyve stepped from the pages of a Jazz Age memoir its not spoiling much to report that they have.On subsequent nights Gil builds suspicion by sneaking off to the same spot where new friends like tough-talking Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) inscrutable Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and colorful Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo) whisk him through a moveable feast.Ernie urges Gil to grab the bull by the horns and commit himself to his writing but Gil is distracted by Picassos mistress Adriana (Marion Cottilard). Like him she pines for an earlier time -- the turn of the century when Gauguin Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec walked these same streets in the gaslight. ""Midnight in Paris"" is a fanciful French cousin to Allens ""Zelig"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" yet the fulfilled wish for a better life is high-concept absurdity without high-anxiety guffaws. Thanks to Wilson Gil is a likable dreamer but his relationship with the shrill Inez is underdeveloped and little is at stake in the untenable time-travel subplot.Cest la vie. ""Midnight in Paris"" is a bonbon to ease the craving for Allens earlier funnier films.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 03 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English In the 11th hour of his career Midnight in Paris is precisely what weve come to expect from Woody Allen - another stop in a European capital another nicely engineered little film more clever than substantial mildly ruminative if hardly profound and attractively cast with actors who much like us are delighted to venture out on a late date with the old pro. Certainly his work here feels effortless and that feather-light touch gives the picture its charm - modest but real. Movies Midnight in Paris The official trailer Canadian actress Rachel McAdams and US director Woody Allen pose on the red carpet before the opening ceremony and the screening of Midnight in Paris presented out-of-competition at the 64th Cannes Film Festival on May 11 2011 in Cannes. FRANCOIS GUILLOT/AFP/Getty Images video Video Woody Allen on working in Paris As in Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona Woody serves up one more couple on the cusp of marriage and finds tension in that now-familiar battle between security and passion. Gil and Inez (Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams) are visiting Paris in the company of her very Republican parents. A successful Hollywood screenwriter but a failed novelist he loves the city and its rich artistic past. She loves herself and shopping. The frustrated Tinseltown hack the pretty blond narcissist - yes theyre both card-carrying cliches yet dont fret too much. Midnight has yet to strike. When it does Woody digs into his personal yesteryear to replay the magic-realism card he pulled out in Zelig and The Purple Rose of Cairo. Wandering the streets in the late evening Gil gets beckoned into a vintage Peugeot and whisked back through the decades to his adored ""golden age"" Paris in the twenties replete with flappers and philosophers and wow Fitzgeralds too. At a Left Bank boite theres Scott and zany Zelda and isnt that Papa Hemingway himself talking just as he writes so good and clean and true. They all take a shine to Gil including the ever-avuncular and wise Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates with cropped do) who deigns to peruse his work-in-progress and pronounces it full of literary promise. Our hero has found his groove among the Lost Generation and for us theres some amusement to be had in sharing Gils thrills - its like stepping into a Classic Comics version of A Moveable Feast. From that point the movie hopscotches between its competing time-frames. In the past we get to play spot-the-famous-artiste while the ensemble has great fun with their typecast cameos - Adrien Brodys take on Dali for example is deliciously surreal. But the fun wears a bit thin when Woody his touch momentarily abandoning him stoops to jokes that beg a rim-shot. Hemingway ""Have you ever hunted?"" Gil ""Only for bargains."" Or Gil again to a bespectacled T.S. Eliot ""Where I come from people measure out their lives in coke spoons."" Ba-dum. Meanwhile in the present that relationship with Inez is appearing more brittle by the minute. Whats worse our celebrity-spotting is greatly diminished although thanks to todays less exacting standards not entirely absent. Indeed look closely and you just might glimpse Carla Bruni-Sarkozy perhaps better known as Frances first lady in a quick turn portraying a tour guide at the Rodin Museum. To the surprise of no one surely not least of all hubby Nicolas she makes for a lovely adornment. Speaking of romance it may be withering in the here and now but back in Gertrudes salon Gil is tumbling hard for Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who having already slept her way from Braque to Modigliani to Picasso has fixed her roving gaze on the California kid. This is where Wilson rides to the rescue injecting an implausible role with lots of wide-eyed ingenuousness along with just the right dash of Woodys classic nebbish. Essentially hes leading with his nose here - both it and his performance are engagingly bent. Admittedly the conceit grows repetitious when the Roaring Twenties further elide into the Belle Epoque whereupon the slim moral of the piece gets doubly underlined Seems everyone in any era thinks an earlier age was golden; seems ""the present is a little unsatisfying because life is a little unsatisfying."" No kidding. Of course even back in his own golden age Woodys pearls of wisdom were rather trite - he was always better at mocking than manufacturing them. Midnight in Paris could do with more mockery but for now that feathery lightness will have to suffice - on lifes aesthetic balance sheet its definitely a little satisfying.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In Woody Allens ""Midnight in Paris"" a 1920 Peugeot cruises down a narrow cobbled street. Somewhere a clock sounds midnight. The car comes to a stop in front of Gil. Played by one of Allens best avatars Owen Wilson this American in Paris has joined his rather forceful fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her underwhelmed parents in the City of Lights. ""Take a cab"" Inez had told him earlier in the evening. ""Youll get lost."" Now he is. And Gil will be a great deal more turned-around before he finds his souls bearings. That vintage sedan is the color of a bumblebee and a festive buzzing emanates from within. Theres heightened buzz around Allens comedy too with some hailing it as his best work in 10 years. (It opened Mays Cannes Film Festival.) Yet as playfully inventive a jaunt as ""Midnight in Paris"" is this assessment suffers from the very hankering that afflicts Gil nostalgia for a bygone era at the risk of missing out on the present. ""Midnight in Paris"" isnt as telling about class as Allens ""Match Point"" or as celebratory and vivid about being smitten by a European city as ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" It is a lyrically crafted fable about romance creativity and the pleasures -- and cautionary lessons -- met when idealizing another artists era. You see Gil loves Paris especially that burg of the 1920s when a whir of creativity put the likes of Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald in the company of artists Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso. These are not the travelers who people the recently published tome ""The Greater Journey Americans in Paris"" by David McCullough but that vivid generation that came just after. That vintage convertible transports Gil the successful screenwriter but full-of-doubt novelist night after night to the Paris of the 1920s. As he moves back and forth between now and then the beguiling amber-hued nights of Scott (Tom Hiddleston) and Zelda (Alison Pill) Dali (Adrien Brody) and Hemingway (Corey Stoll) trump the present of Inez and her parents. Kathy Bates has fun presiding over a salon as Gertrude Stein or Gert to her friends and the authors who bring their manuscripts to her. One night at Gerts Gil meets Adriana. With a face seemingly crafted by fate for the old-fashioned close-up Marion Cotillard (those eyes) portrays the woman who captures the fancy of Picasso Hemingway and yes our shirt-tucked- into-his-chinos scribe. ""Midnight in Paris"" is charming and clever at times wickedly astute and hopeful. But what stands between this movie and greatness is contempt. Not Gils -- hes a naif an optimist. The current of dislike is Allens -- for Inez and her ugly American ilk. The pseudo-cultured and glibly provincial are well-represented by Inez and her monied parents John and Helen. And actors Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy make it so easy to bristle at these two. Inezs friend Paul (Michael Sheen) is equally insufferable. These people arent nice; OK fine. But the deck feels a bit too stacked. What were led to ask even as we root for Gil How has he gotten this far in a relationship with this harridan beautifully clad shapely but a harpy just the same? What are we to make of that? Romantic comedy. 1 hour 34 minutes. PG-13. At the Mayan.

More about Midnight in Paris >> I always respond by saying as soon as he makes a really good one Ill be first in line to sing its praises. Well I lied. I wasnt first in line because ""Midnight in Paris"" played at Cannes and opened in New York and was widely lauded in those locales. But were talking about New York subject of so many Allen rhapsodies and France rhapsodized itself in ""Midnight in Paris."" So Im here at the front of line of unaffiliated Allen-bashers to say that his latest ""Midnight in Paris"" is funny humane (minus one shrill female) and mostly delightful. And a bit of a shock coming from Allen whos been saying in interviews lately that the universe is a cold empty futile place - no certitude or peace or help for pain as the poet said. OK life sucks. Hes not the first filmmaker to think so. But theres a big difference between ""life sucks"" and ""people suck"" and the latter POV has been taking over Allens recent movies. I braced for more of the same in the opening moments of ""Midnight in Paris"" wherein a Hollywood screenwriter named Gil (Owen Wilson) and his fiancee (Rachel McAdams) sit down to dine with her conservative parents in Paris. There are jokes about the tea party remarks about the decline of Hollywood movies. Gil trashes the movie industry thinks of himself as a hack and wonders why hes so bad at ""real"" writing - he cant finish his novel. I was braced for another of Allens expat critiques of a country and culture in decline. And then like magic and via a magical realist device Gil and ""Midnight"" go in an entirely different direction. Gil walks the city alone in the evening and at the chimes of midnight is carried by a vintage cab to the creative ferment of 1920s Paris meeting (funny caricatures of) Hemingway Gertrude Stein Dali Picasso Luis Bunuel F. Scott Fitzgerald. He even gets Stein (Kathy Bates) to critique his novel. By day hes back in contemporary Paris trapped with his wifes know-it-all pal (a hilarious Michael Sheen) yearning for midnight when he re-enters the past. The yearning becomes especially intense when he meets Picassos model and paramour (Marianne Cotillard) who may be looking for a new artist to inspire. Perhaps a young American writer? There is breezy comedy to be made of a YouTube-age writer meeting the icons and idols of a bygone classical era (""Bill and Teds Literary Adventure"") but Allen goes deeper expanding on his time-travel device to make unexpected and unexpectedly generous observations on the enduring nature of art and artists. ""Paris"" is full of wisdom and also full of Cotillard - ingeniously (and convincingly) cast by Allen as the muse and model whose influence goes much further than jazz-age cubists and novelists. ""Paris"" is also full of jokes some updated from the directors own classic bits. Sheen gets skewered in a time-travel version Allens famous Marshall McLuhan gag from ""Annie Hall."" The aliens of Allens ""Stardust Memories"" said that if a comedian like Allen wanted to do mankind a service hed tell funnier jokes. In ""Midnight in Paris"" Allen does us a service.

Comments (5) click to enlarge Midnight in Paris Recommended Rated PG-13  94 minutes  2011 Woody Allens bad movies often seem to be taking place in some kind of upper-class fantasy world which may be the reason I find this upfront fantasy (2011) to be his funniest most agreeable comedy in years. (The last one this good was Bullets Over Broadway in 1994.) A Hollywood screenwriter (Owen Wilson the perfect whiny Allen surrogate) vacations in Paris with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams) whos getting hit on by an arrogant know-it-all professor (Michael Sheen). With a setup like this the movie threatens to become yet another variation on Manhattan but then the screenwriter moping around the city after dark is picked up by a vintage Peugot that spirits him back to the storied Paris of the 1920s. Night after night he returns to the Jazz Age rubbing elbows with all his heroes (Ernest Hemingway F. Scott Fitzgerald Gertrude Stein Salvador Dali Luis Bunuel) yet Allens deep regard for these cultural icons doesnt inhibit him from giving them all a good ribbing.

In Annie Hall the adult Alvy Singer summons Marshall McLuhan from thin air to silence an annoying movie patron. In The Purple Rose of Cairo Mia Farrows lonely Depression-era movie addict finds companionship when Jeff Daniels adventurer steps off the screen and into her life. In the short story ""The Kugelmass Episode"" a bored professor enters a magic cabinet and a passionate affair with Emma Bovary.These are the antecedents to Midnight in Paris a frothy glass of whimsy that marks Allens best work since 2005s Match Point. A delightful sketch in which Dallas Owen Wilson brings a laid-back vibe to the long gallery of surrogate Woodys Midnight is wise to ways of the unavoidable good ol days syndrome -- or as the film aptly calls it Golden Age Thinking.Wilson is Gil a self-described ""Hollywood hack"" working on his first novel. Visiting Paris with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams in an unforgiving role) and future in-laws he realizes how much he loves the city (as does the filmmaker if the opening travelogue montage set to a jazzy horn riff is any indication). The thing is he longs for the Paris of the 20s peopled by the ""lost generation"" of expatriates who romanticized excessive drinking and the anything-goes ethos of the day. Why cant he live there far away from the demands of what his life has become?As a screenwriter Gil should know his wish is Allens command. Out for a late-night solo stroll Gil finds a Twilight Zone portal that takes him to a party where Cole Porter sings ""Lets Do It"" and the bickering Fitzgeralds Scott and Zelda (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill) hold forth. Soon hes carousing with Hemingway (Corey Stall relishing his terse task) dancing the Charleston with novelist Djuna Barnes (Nightwood) consulting Gertrude Stein (SMUs Kathy Bates) and falling in love with Adriana (Marion Cotillard luminous) a composite mistress of Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo). ""How long have you been dating Picasso?"" asks Gil before realizing just how ridiculous the question sounds.Allen builds on the premise and stays in the moment with sharp comic jabs. Explaining his dilemma to Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) Man Ray (Tom Cordier) and Luis Bunuel (Adrien de Van) Gil is surprised that they see nothing odd. Then he remembers that theyre all surrealists. But the big picture also stays in focus. Adriana a resident of Gils dream world longs for the Paris of the Belle Epoque. So they visit and find that Degas and Gauguin long for the Renaissance. ""The present is a little unsatisfying"" Gil observes ""because life is a little unsatisfying.""Gils real-world foils are made of straw His fiancee and her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) are shallow Philistines; his romantic rival (Michael Sheen) belongs to that species for which Allen has always held comic venom the gaseous pseudo-intellectual. Theyre flimsy characters but they also help throw Gils romantic longing into sharp relief. Other times and places always seem so appealing. ""I wish it was the 60s I wish we could be happy"" sneers Radioheads Thom Yorke on ""The Bends."" Alas mon Dieu were stuck where we are -- except of course when we go to movies.Midnight in ParisB+ Starring Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams Marion Cotillard Alison Pill Kathy Bates Corey Stall Tom Hiddleston Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy.

Whats Wilson doing in a Woody Allen movie about a B-list screenwriter who time-travels from the present to the Jazz Age? Disarming the audience with his wistful joie de vivre thats what. Slideshow Woody Allens Midnight in Paris a dreamy souffle Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Midnight in Paris >> Lucky is he who lived in Paris in his youth thinks Gil (Wilson). Luckier still is he who lived in Paris during the 1920s an era before digital clocks when minute and hour hands caressed at midnight jazz was hot and champagne flowed like the Seine. Would that he lived in that Golden Age when Ernest Hemingway hammered out manly phrases on his Royal typewriter Cole Porter tickled alliterative sonnets from his Steinway Picasso evoked the eroticism of almond-eyed beauties at his easel and Gertrude Stein served as the cultural den mother to these frisky creative cubs. Alas for Gil a screenwriter with hair like a strafed cornfield and a heart like that of a pining troubadour he lives in the present day of digital clocks and laptops. But a guy can dream cant he? In France with his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) this self-described ""Hollywood hack"" and aspiring novelist this broken-nosed Sleeping Beauty is awakened by Paris. To mix the fairy-tale metaphor Gils party unlike Cinderellas doesnt end at midnight. Thats when it begins. Because thats when Gil is transported by a two-toned taxi to the Paris of his dreams. Midnight in Paris is not a perfect movie - as in Julie amp; Julia one senses its creators impatience to leave the bleached-out present for the colorful past. But it is warm and effortless qualities that make it embraceable. After an unpromising opening montage resembling views of Paris from the tour bus - on your left the Louvre ahead thats Montmartre and to your right the Place de la Concorde - in shuffle Gil and Inez. Hes turned on by the citys creative ghosts; shes turned on by shopping. Inez is also turned on by Paul (Michael Sheen) her know-it-all former professor a pedant who diagnoses Gils problem Inezs fiance he says suffers from ""Golden Age thinking"" denying the present by indulging in fanciful dreams of the past. That novel Gil is writing? Its about a man who owns a nostalgia shop. One night while roaming the streets and outlining his next chapter Gil hears the chimes of midnight when hes invited into a taxi by Americans in 1920s costume. Their names? Scott and Zelda the latter played by the loopy beauty Alison Pill. Those who can place the names of these American expats will enjoy Midnight in Paris more than those who cannot. But even one who doesnt know Gertrude Stein from Dora Maar or Luis Bunuel from Salvador Dali can enjoy the enchanting premise of the film in which Gil befriends his cultural gods before their ascent to Olympus and gracefully navigates the gulf between their time and his own. (As does cinematographer Darius Khondji whose modern-day Paris is harshly overlit and whose old-time capital has the tomato-reds ceruleans and blacks of a cubist painting.) During his midnight rambles among American and Spanish expatriates in Paris Gil meets the ravishing Adriana (heartstoppingly beautiful Marion Cotillard). To paraphrase a line from Allens similar-themed The Purple Rose of Cairo Gil has just met a wonderful new woman. She lives in a different era but he cant have everything. While the heady Adriana is more Gils soul mate than the materialistic Inez (one of Allens more shrewish creations) something comes between Gil and his new friend thats harder to get around than an 80-year time difference. That something and how to apply it to life is the epiphany of Allens improbable and surprisingly satisfying film about lost illusions and dreams fulfilled.

Like Match Point (which Allen shot in London) and Vicky Cristina Barcelona (his first picture in Spain) Midnight in Paris is a terrific picture -  an appealing bubbly intelligent fantasy made by a director in an unusually playful mood. Allens love of Paris shines through every frame -- he opens the movie with a montage of cityscapes as in Manhattan and makes the cafes bookshops open-air markets and museums essential elements of a place you would want to live. (The cinematographer was Darius Khondji who has often worked with David Fincher.) Gil (Owen Wilson) a self-described ""hack screenwriter"" who has come to visit with his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents immediately feels that pull. He marvels at everything Paris has to offer and one night when Inez goes dancing with mutual friends he takes a stroll through Montmartre. When the clock strikes midnight a vintage car pulls up filled with vivacious not-quite-from-this-era revelers who invite him to climb in and join them. Among his new acquaintainces F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Ernest Hemingway Luis Bunuel Pablo Picasso Salvador Dali Cole Porter T.S. Eliot Gertrude Stein and a number of other 1920s Golden Age giants. Gil is initially befuddled -- how could this be happening? -- but everyone is so welcoming and friendly he blends in and has the night of his life basking in the company of so much genius. Naturally the next morning when he must return to the contrarian Inez and her mundane itinerary of shopping and antiquing Gil feels more than a little bored. Allen has cast Midnight in Paris with a terrific ensemble Kathy Bates plays Stein with the perfect combination of motherly authority (she agrees to read Gils novel which he has refused to show to anyone thus far) and Adrien Brody is particularly amusing as the oddball Dali. When Gil meets and falls for Modiglianis beautiful former lover (Marion Cotillard) the temptation to remain in the 1920s becomes even stronger. Despite the frivolous nature of Midnight in Paris Allen is seriously exploring our tendency to look back on the past with unmitigated nostalgia. ""The present is never the golden age"" someone points out and the present is also always going to be a little unsatisfying because life is. Choosing to explore these themes by incorporating such acclaimed artists gives the movie a heady kick and the snappy pace and upbeat mood prove intoxicating. Midnight in Paris initially seems like a departure for Allen but the prevailing theme blends right in with the rest of his canon In order to enjoy life at its fullest you have to live in the moment and savor what you have instead of fretting about what may be waiting around the next corner.

Allen is at his most fluid and fluently witty in years. Starring Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams Director Woody Allen Release Opened May 27 2011  Editorial Review Midnight in ParisBy Ann HornadayFriday May 27 2011From its rapturous opening sequence ""Midnight in Paris"" announces that Woody Allen has returned to at least one of his most beloved forms. The writer-director whose work has skimmed screwball comedy Bergman-esque drama melancholic romance and misanthropic satire comes back to his ""Manhattan"" roots here as that opening number soaringly attests.While saxophonist Sidney Bechet plays ""Si Tu Vois Ma Mere"" images of Paris amble past each street corner rooftop and rainy square more unabashedly romantic than the last. Allen lingers on the sequence letting it play just a tad longer than is strictly comfortable. His message to the audience is underlined italicized and written in bold This is my Paris. Sink in soak it up and surrender yourself.Those who follow his lead will be richly rewarded. ""Midnight in Paris"" finds Allen in a larky slightly tart and altogether bountiful mood giving filmgoers a movie that while unabashedly funny and playful provides a profiterole or two for thought. Owen Wilson plays Gil a screenwriter and would-be serious author whos visiting Paris with his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy).Gil is besotted with the Paris of the 1920s when his heroes F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway traded dry martinis and even drier barbs with the likes of Gertrude Stein and Pablo Picasso. Inez and her family on the other hand couldnt care less. When Gil mentions that Hemingway called Paris a moveable feast Inezs mom quips that ""in this traffic nothing moves."" The mood is doubly spoiled when they bump into Paul (Michael Sheen) an old college crush of Inezs now an incorrigible pedant. (Versailles he helpfully advises Gil and Inez originally meant ""terrain where the weeds have been pulled"").Newly alive to his own thwarted literary ambitions or perhaps threatened by the obvious attraction between Inez and Paul Gil winds up exploring Paris on his own embarking on an enchanted journey that brings him into contact with a ravishing designer named Adriana (Marion Cotillard). Toggling easily between the contemporary Paris and the idealized city of Gils imagination ""Midnight in Paris"" finds Allen at his most fluid and fluently witty in years. The filmmaker has set himself a tricky technical needle to thread but Allen moves with ease between contemporary satire and a fairy tale inhabited by such legendary artists as Dali Picasso and Hemingway the last played here by Corey Stoll (""Law amp; Order L.A."") in scene-stealing line readings from Papas famously terse prose. (Once in a while the two worlds collide with particular hilarity as when Gil slips a Valium to Zelda Fitzgerald played by Alison Pill.)Allen is less generous toward his present-day cast of characters. With more texture and depth for example Inez and Paul could have been far more interesting and amusing than the odious caricatures they are here. In Wilson however Allen has lighted on an improbably appealing guide. Granted its a bit of a stretch to believe the ultimate surfer dude as the type of guy who would know what James Joyce ate during his Paris sojourn. But he makes for a refreshingly sunny Allen avatar displaying none of his directors neurotic mannerisms and in crucial sequences perfectly embodying a quintessential 21st-century man utterly at odds with his archaic surroundings.As an exhilarating valentine to the luminosity that gives the City of Light its name ""Midnight in Paris"" is sheer pleasure to watch full of rich visuals and felicitous comic turns (watch for the way Nina Arianda as Pauls wife Carol shakily pronounces her high school French and for a delightful cameo from French first lady Carla Bruni as a sensitive museum guide). But theres also substance beneath the glossy veneer and fanciful high jinks a wistful meditation on nostalgia self-deception and commitment that reminds viewers of the philosophical heft that has always characterized Allens strongest work.As Gil succumbs to the enticements of ambered memory and Pariss most alluring charms ""Midnight in Paris"" becomes not so much an escape into fantasy as a seductive oddly affecting reverie on the most timeless reality of all that love may have less to do with physical attraction or even intellectual harmony than with the willingness to inhabit someone elses dreams. ""Midnight in Paris"" may be a mere bagatelle but its a beguiling one brimming with sweetness and soul. Contains some sexual references and smoking.

Starring Owen Wilson Marion Cotillard Rachel Mc-Adams Kathy Bates. Directed by Woody Allen. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Was there ever really a golden age? And if so did people know it at the time? Are people even capable of recognizing a golden age when theyre in the midst of one? For Woody Allen whose musical and cultural tastes run to the 1920s and 30s these questions have probably fueled countless daydreams. And now out of all that rumination comes ""Midnight in Paris"" a movie thats loving and wistful and often hysterically funny. Romance is built into the design. A screenwriter who has always been nostalgic visits modern-day Paris and falls through a ripple in time On a Paris street a clock strikes midnight and a 1920s taxicab drives up. F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald are inside and they take him to a party. Though at first the writer thinks these are faux Fitzgeralds and that hes at a costume party he soon realizes that this is the real deal. He is surrounded by the music and styles he loves and is mingling with his idols and artistic heroes. Our heros dislocation keeps the movie as light as it needs to be. Meeting celebrities can be awkward enough but meeting legends of the past - the eagerness to please would be overwhelming. Yet always there is an edge of poignancy too because you are looking at the 20s through the eyes of a modern person as a world that is by definition past. The past is always romantic because its gone just as the future is always frightening because youre gone. Related Stories Midnight in Paris Theres an idea about Paris at work here as well. Allen takes the notion of streets alive with the past and makes it literal in ""Midnight in Paris"" so that everything that has ever happened in this city never goes away. Its alive with parallel worlds - which is sometimes how we feel when we visit great cities like Paris Rome or New York. Gil (Wilson) finds himself able to go back and forth between his own time and the 20s and so we keep feeling the contrast. In the 21st century he is engaged to an awful spoiled brat played without compromise by Rachel Mc-Adams. Meanwhile in his nightly 20s rambles he is falling in love with Adriana (Marion Cotillard) who is having an affair with Picasso. As was the case with Penelope Cruz in ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" Woody Allen brings out for the first time in an American film the fire and allure Cotillard has shown in her European work. In the meantime in between all the longing and wistfulness this movie is sidesplitting because Allen gets to tap into an inexhaustible source of comedy Whenever he wants a laugh or 10 laughs he just introduces another writer or painter and plays to our expectations. Every scene for example involving Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) is a scream because Allen has him talk the way Hemingway wrote. There is even a Man Ray joke here. And if you know Luis Bunuels ""The Exterminating Angel"" youll fall out of your chair when Gil starts feeding him movie ideas. Adrien Brody shows up as the young Salvador Dali - good casting. Alison Pill looks very much like Zelda though Tom Hiddleston is too tall for Scott Fitzgerald who was just a little bigger than Woody Allen. But Kathy Bates is just right as Gertrude Stein as businesslike and motherly as youd want her to be. -- Advisory Lots of smoking - they didnt know better in those days.

"Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips Midnight in Paris review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Change of scenery helps reinvigorate Woody AllenMidnight in Paris a 3.5 starsMay 26 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticOwen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in the Woody Allen movie ""Midnight in Paris.""Scrambling the itinerary of the swingin Sammy Cahn/Jimmy Van Heusen song ""Its Nice to Go Travling"" which Frank Sinatra sang on his ""Come Fly With Me"" album Woody Allen has now made three pictures in London beginning with ""Match Point."" Allen has announced hell next shoot in Rome.Meanwhile we have Allens latest ""Midnight in Paris"" which goes where the title goes. It is a modest pleasure -- a tasty comic fantasy one of three or four Allen pictures from the last 15 years or so (amid scads of forgettable or worse efforts) that operate on a sound premise expand upon it cleverly and prove that while Allen may not be reinventing any wheels he still has it.With ""Midnight in Paris"" it helps to have an Allen surrogate the disenchanted Hollywood screenwriter played by Owen Wilson who does more than remind the audience that its difficult for a male lead in one of his films to sound like anyone other than Woody Allen. With his Texas drawl and his rather-be-surfing aura of genial distraction Wilson makes everything go down easily here. Who would have guessed this actor would turn out to be an ideal conduit for Allens nostalgic and romantic concerns?The movie relies on two narrative conceits one fresh one not so much. In the not-so-much Gil (Wilson) and his princessy bratty fiancee (Rachel McAdams warming up a cliche when and where she can) are visiting modern-day Paris with her folks. Gil yearns to chuck it all and return to the completion of his novel. Hes a hopeless nostalgist who longs for Paris in the 1920s and often daydreams about hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway Gertrude Stein a painter or a filmmaker or a famous songwriter or two. Walking alone one night at midnight Gils visited by a gleaming Jazz Age limousine carrying a madcap couple the Fitzgeralds.Well keep some of the comic surprises a secret except to say Marion Cotillard emerges as a beguiling object of desire and intimate of the famous. She has her own yearning for the past to complement Gils. The occasionally wearying quality of the contemporary scenes in ""Midnight in Paris"" serves mainly to get the audience on Gils side though they really are more formulaic than necessary. The leap or rather glide into the realm of the fantastic is at once familiar and potent. Allen doesnt play much of it for broad comedy (though when Adrien Brody shows up as a certain flamboyant Surrealist its a delight) nor for the aggressive pathos of ""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" It explores a profitable middle ground between the two.Allen dealt with a similar gimmick in his short story ""The Kugelmass Episode"" about an unhappily married city college professor who falls into the pages of Flauberts ""Madame Bovary."" ""Midnight in Paris"" works in a mellower key. At its Cannes Film Festival premiere earlier this month audiences warmed to it; already it has opened strongly in New York and Los Angeles. Its what youd call a minor insight of a comedy; in fact Wilsons character uses that phrase (""minor insight"" that is) to describe what his nocturnal wanderings teach him about making the most of the present and embracing the one life we know we have.An air of diminished expectations has hung over much of Allens work since the 1990s. Here the shadows and fog lift a little. Led by Wilson and Cotillard the ensemble makes the most of the material that works and makes the best of the rest of it.mjphillipstribune.comTwitter phillipstribuneMPAA rating PG-13 (for some sexual references and smoking)Cast Owen Wilson (Gil); Rachel McAdams (Inez); Kathy Bates (Gert); Adrien Brody (Salvador); Carla Bruni (museum guide); Marion Cotillard (Adriana); Lea Seydoux (Gabrielle); Michael Sheen (Paul); Nina Arianda (Carol); Kurt Fuller (John); Mimi Kennedy (Helen)Credits Written and directed by Woody Allen; produced by Letty Aronson Stephen Tenenbaum and Jaume Roures.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Midnight in Paris Woody Allens 41st feature film is a sweet-natured trifle as flavorful and as thin as a crepe. It stars Owen Wilson as Gil Pender a hack Hollywood screenwriter and struggling novelist who takes a series of late-night walks while visiting Paris and finds himself transported back to the expatriate era of the 1920s. There Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) holds court for such buzzing luminosities as Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tim Hiddleston and Alison Pill) Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) Cole Porter Josephine Baker and so forth.Its a delicious conceit and Allen milks the absurdity. Gil plops down at a cafe and at the next table are Dali (Adrien Brody) Bunuel (Adrien de Van) and Man Ray (Tom Cordier). A cab door opens and theres T.S. Eliot fresh from ""The Waste Land. In the rues the women come and go talking of Pablo Picasso (Marcial Di Fonzo Bo).That theyre all caricatures as cartoony as a great-author drawing on a PBS book-bag doesnt really matter. Stolls Hemingway is a terrific creation a ripe macho adverb-free punch line of a young Papa. Gils a caricature too -- the hand-wringing Allen neurotic were so familiar with -- and so are the people in his modern-day life his shrill fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) her horrid parents (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy) a pseudo-intellectual prat (Michael Sheen) with one eye on the Louvre and the other on Inezs legs.Anyway caricature is all Allen has offered us for many years now and his movies are best when theyre up front about it. ""Midnight in Paris has the brisk gimmicky half-life of one of Woodys New Yorker sketches. Next to calamities like last years ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger and 2009s ""Whatever Works this has to count as an improvement.Theres evidence that Allen wants to go deeper though. For one thing this is the rare movie to take Wilsons disconsolate side seriously -- the knowledge that being a bland blond Hollywood stud isnt all its cracked up to be -- and the actor responds with a performance thats sadder and more soulful than whats on the page. More to the point Woody hangs his own need for nostalgia out to dry or he pretends to.The movie asks us to ask ourselves which historical era each of us would live in if magic allowed for it knowing were never happy where we are. Gil longs for the Paris of 85 years ago while Adriana (Marion Cotillard) the rueful party girl he meets during his Jazz Age wanderings pines for the Folies and La Belle Epoque. In its final act ""Midnight in Paris goes through the looking-glass more than once impishly suggesting a long intertwined series of perfect pasts and imperfect presents.Whats so wrong with what weve got? Its a real question and Allen makes a show of answering it. Yet the modern sequences are the weakest most obvious moments in ""Midnight in Paris with their cliched tourists shots of famous landmarks and McAdams betrayed by the strikingly cruel shallowness of her part. Inez isnt a real person shes the directors fear and loathing of American vulgarity (and vulgar American women) and the way the movie pushes forward Cotillard and Lea Seydoux even French first lady Carla Bruni (playing a museum guide) as possible replacements -- theyre pliant oh so French open to walks in the rain -- isnt an examination of upscale male fantasy but a capitulation to it.Well as this director knows the heart wants what the heart wants -- I think he was talking about his heart -- even at the expense of genuine reflection and honest filmmaking. ""Midnight in Paris has a crush on the past and it makes that crush palpable and great fun with a famous dead artist in every patisserie and Django-esque guitar riffs goosing the story along. At the same time this is ""Zelig without a spine a work that wallows in the nostalgia it professes to puncture. For better and for worse its as if Allens celebrated title sequence -- that zippy 1920s jazz that damned Windsor Light Condensed font -- has finally taken over one of his movies.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Midnight in Paris Good Director Woody Allen. Cast Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams Marion Cotillard. Rating Rated PG-13 for some sexual references and smoking. Note At Harkins Camelview. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Rachel McAdams A magical-realist gem harking back to ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" ""Midnight"" is a bit thin and glib to call a masterpiece - at 75 Allen is unlikely to have another one of those in him - but its still a delicious trifle for anyone who has ever dreamt of bantering about the cinema with Luis Bunuel or lounging at the piano to hear Cole Porter sing ""Lets Do It."" Wilson best known for playing the rakish pretty boy in such lowbrow comedies as ""Wedding Crashers"" stars as Gil Pender a successful screenwriter who refers to himself as a ""Hollywood hack"" and is stuck in revision mode on his Great American Novel. Hes in Paris with his blandly attractive fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) whos far more interested in his ability to pay for a Malibu mansion than in his restless romantic spirit. Gil endures her disdain with the chipper loyalty of a dog though his hackles are raised when they bump into her cloying ex Paul (Michael Sheen). He discourses on Monet at Giverny and the architecture of Versailles. He corrects the tour guide at the Musee Rodin. He is . . . the most tedious man in the world. But he does have Gils number. Hearing the SoCal dilettante wax poetic about la vie boheme in the Paris of yesteryear Paul quips ""All thats missing is the tuberculosis"" and diagnoses his nostalgia for the Roaring Twenties as ""a flaw in the mind of people who find it difficult to cope in the present."" Then drunk and lost at midnight Gil is rescued by a dashing couple in a ""vintage"" auto who turn out to be Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and drag him along to a Jazz Age soiree. The parade of luminaries is ridiculous and delightsome. Stein (Kathy Bates) plays literary den mother Dali (Adrien Brody) obsesses on the beauty of the rhinoceros and Hemingway (Corey Stall) talks as if reading from one of his novels terse and muscular. (His verdict on an anxious combed-over Pablo Picasso ""Hes great but hes no Miro."") Gil is wowed by Mrs. Fitzgerald (played by Alison Pill with a boozy bipolar verve) but its Picassos mistress Adriana (Cotillard) who becomes the symbol of all his naive dreams. Yet she is too much like Gil Her own present is a burden and a bewilderment and she longs for the elegance of La Belle Epoque. While the denouement is predictable the little surprises along the way make ""Midnight in Paris"" a satisfying love letter not only to the City of Light but to ""cultchah"" itself.

At times Allen seems stuck in an earlier era like a phonograph needle skipping on one of his beloved Dixieland albums. He stubbornly crafts films out of archaic ingredients like Plot Pacing Dialogue and Characterization even though 21st-century moviemaking has evolved beyond those Etruscan elements. His latest the swell soiree ""Midnight in Paris"" has it both ways re-creating the period-piece charms of ""Bullets Over Broadway"" and ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" while spoofing his own infatuation with a world gone by. Owen Wilson plays Gil a successful screenwriter with an anachronistic urge to write a novel. Gil is visiting Paris with his high-maintenance fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her crass wealthy parents. While Inez cant wait to get back to Malibu Gil wanders the picturesque side streets imagining himself in the Paris of Hemingway Fitzgerald and the titans of modern art. One night as a bell tower tolls 12 a vintage limo pulls up and Gil is swept into a band of merrymakers dressed for a flapper costume ball. When they arrive at their destination Gil realizes the partygoers arent impersonating his artistic idols theyre the real thing. Wilsons expression as understanding dawns is like a kids face as the lights come up at a circus. Gil returns to the present invigorated and to Inezs puzzlement -- and her parents suspicion -- begins taking long rambles every night. Soon hes revising his manuscript with recommendations from literary lions. Travel broadens the mind time travel especially. MIDNIGHT IN PARIS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for some sexual references and smoking. Theater Uptown. The ensemble playing historical characters is sublime. Tom Hiddleston (Loki in ""Thor"") makes a fine Scott Fitzgerald eager to be liked nervous and utterly besotted by his tempestuous Zelda (Alison Pill of ""Scott Pilgrim""). Corey Stoll (""Law amp; Order Los Angeles"") is a terse Ernest Hemingway speaking that trademark brand of macho haiku. Wild-eyed Adrien Brody nails the inspired lunacy of Salvador Dali. And as Adriana Picassos mistress (and Braques and Modiglianis -- the girl gets around) Marion Cotillard is allure incarnate. Gil is a tough character to play a starstruck Everyman tossed into a heaving sea of geniuses. Wilson does wonders with this reactive role. From his wistful disenchantment with McAdams to his underplayed crush on Cotillard to the way he feeds the ball to his co-stars so they can score this is Wilsons finest performance since ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" Allens script gives Wilson great gags that double as bittersweet character notes. When Gil calms overstressed Zelda with a Valium he explains ""its the pill of the future."" Trying to re-enter the 1920s club after the golden hour has passed he finds it turned into a coin laundry which says everything about his view of the present. When he pitches surrealist filmmaker Luis Bunuel a plot about aristocrats trapped at a dinner party they cant escape (the setup for Bunuels ""The Exterminating Angel"") its a commentary on Gils posh inertia. Allen forces Gil to confront his illusions about a golden age better than his own. His Jazz Age dream girl pines for the Paris of gaslights can-can dancers and Toulouse-Lautrec. It takes one night in 1890 for Gil to see that while nostalgia isnt what it used to be (and it never was) its never too late for a happy ending. ""Midnight in Paris"" makes you yearn for the time when brainy larks werent a once-a-year occasion. Why back in the 70s. ...

Amillennialistsaid on Tuesday January 24 2012 12720 AMWhat starts out as a beautiful film about a man who discovers a chance to live in his own idealized past is destroyed halfway through the film when Allen has his protagonists fantasizing about the past ruined by . . . his fantasy from the past. And how obnoxious to have the snooty self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual articulate the directors theme. The sniping at Conservatives was dull. And how can one condemn romanticizing the past when one romanticizes a city? Just because Woody Allen is bitter and hopeless doesnt mean we have to be bitter and hopeless also. Mattsaid on Sunday January 15 2012 113702 PMThis movie really resonated with me. Maybe Im just a Gil living in a world of Inezs. Gwensaid on Saturday December 31 2011 81443 AMWas not thrilled with this movie... but here are my pros/cons Pros you really get a feel for the magic of paris good acting great message Cons the writing (overkill on the message of ""enjoy the moment/era youre in"") Rachel McAdams character was one-note (all evil not multi-dimensional) even though she was given a fair amount of screen time I watched on blu-ray and thought the picture was grainy... thought this movie deserved better cameras and I disagree about Owen Wilsons acting... wasnt impressed (I will say though that his overly nasal voice kinda bothers me think he should work on that or change his tone for some of his movies) goopsaid on Friday July 01 2011 123638 AMjust got back from seeing it with my lady. it was great we both enjoyed it immensely. I wasnt sure where it was going really but once he went back in time it pulled me in. Rosabelsaid on Friday June 24 2011 70854 AMI?m not worhty to be in the same forum. ROTFL Mike Chismsaid on Tuesday June 21 2011 125600 AMif i had to give this movie a grade i would give it a C. the movie just didnt seem it had a point. The whole movie seemed to be rushed and like many woody allen movies by the end of the movie it just seemed like he didnt know how to end it. A movie that is 88 minutes shouldnt feel rushed at all. It should make me want to see much more but by the end i just wanted to get out. my last thing is ik that maybe the charm would be lost if he explained the reason y this happens but what happens to the rest of France at midnight since apparently this happens every night when this whole thing happens? It just barely entertained me. i think it would of been better as a 30 minute short film Dan SkipAllensaid on Sunday June 12 2011 32743 AMThis is my review of Midnight in Paris Dan Skip Allensaid on Saturday June 11 2011 40838 AMThis is my review of Midnight in Paris POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 20 2011 Save for later Saved Woody Allens Midnight in Paris is a charming piece of transcendent tourism. From left Michael Sheen as Paul Nina Arianda as Carol Rachel McAdams as Inez and Owen Wilson as Gil. Sony Pictures Classics          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Woody Allen has directed so many movies - about one a year since the 1970s - that they tend to blend together. This is especially so since he often retreads the same material albeit with enough twists to cover his tracks.His latest film - or should I say this years Woody Allen entry - is a sweet not altogether satisfying variation on the fantasy-becomes-reality conceit he used in his Depression-era ""The Purple Rose of Cairo.""In ""Midnight in Paris"" Owen Wilson plays Gil a successful self-described Hollywood hack vacationing with his flinty fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams). Trying to complete his first novel - a serious work he hopes will validate his self-worth if not overfill his bank account - he falls in love with Paris and its romantic connection to his Lost Generation idols Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Then mysteriously he finds himself each midnight transported back to that time where he communes and carouses not only with those writers but with the likes of Picasso Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) Monet Dali (Adrien Brody) Luis Bunuel Cole Porter T.S. Eliot - you get the picture. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? After a while the passing parade of geniuses becomes in itself a source of amusement.Allen floats the idea that every generation considers its own era to be something less than a golden age. Paul (Michael Sheen) an insufferably pedantic friend of Inez who is in Paris with his wife (Nina Arianda) to lecture at the Sorbonne declares that ""nostalgia is denial."" Gil whose novel is set in a nostalgia shop believes just the opposite. By actually meeting up with these great artists he is validating his true self. He even gets Stein to read his manuscript (and lo and behold she likes it).The set pieces where Gil hangs out with legends are often pointedly funny and sometimes touching. Allen sets Gil up with Adriana (the exquisite Marion Cotillard) a mistress of Picasso and Braque who wishes she lived in La Belle Epoque.Corey Stolls Hemingway with his overdeveloped machismo speaks just like a Hemingway character - or more accurately a parody of a Hemingway character. (Allen should enter himself in the annual Bad Hemingway competition. Hed probably win.)Brodys Dali who repeatedly announces his own name with a royal flourish is a marvelous caricature of a poseur-genius. A particularly tart touch He and his fellow Surrealists are completely cool with Gils admission that hes dropped in from the future.But Allen doesnt go very deep into his time-travel conceit. I kept waiting for Gil or somebody to point out that Fitzgerald and Hemingway ended out their lives in radically bleaker straits.Gil who is essentially standing in for Allen remains forever starry-eyed. Reality never really intrudes on his romanticism which comes to seem more gaga than grandiose - though I dont think Allen sees it that way.Allen has been criticized for his sanitized Gershwinized view of Manhattan and he does a similar thing here with the City of Lights.Charming as it often is ""Midnight in Paris"" is essentially a piece of transcendent tourism from an artist who despite his comic acuity still believes in Tinker Bell. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for some sexual references and smoking.)

By Dana Stevens Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in Midnight in Paris Woody Allens Midnight in Paris (Sony Pictures Classics) is a trifle in both senses of the word a feather-light disposable thing and a rich dessert appealingly layered with cake jam and cream. Its the first Woody Allen movie in a long time that feels good going down even if it doesnt stay in your stomach for long afterward. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. After an exquisite opening montage showing Paris in different lights and weathers (the lambent cinematography is by Darius Khondji) we meet Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) a successful but creatively frustrated Hollywood screenwriter on vacation in Paris with his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Once there the couple meet up with an insufferable professor friend (Michael Sheen having a grand old time) and his girlfriend. On a tour of Versailles they talk about Gils novel in progress which centers around the theme of historical nostalgia; Gil is obsessed with Paris in the 20s the era of Cole Porter and Gertrude Stein. That night Gil skips a post-dinner nightclub outing to wander the streets of the city in a pleasantly tipsy haze. When a vintage Peugeot full of partyers pulls up and invites him to join their revels Gil asks few questions--until he finds himself at a party attended by F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald with Cole Porter himself at the piano. Somehow--never mind how as science fiction is not Allens beat--Gil has discovered a crack in the time-space continuum that opens between the 20s and the present when the clock strikes midnight. Advertisement At the legendary Polidor restaurant that night Gil also meets Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) who communicates hilariously only in short Anglo-Saxon bursts of speech about courage and manliness. Hemingway agrees to look at Gils manuscript but when Gil comes back after fetching it at his hotel not only has Hemingway vanished so has the Polidor. Over the course of the next few days Gils life becomes divided between the long dull days with the increasingly irritated Inez and the brief magical nights when he dances the Charleston with Djuna Barnes and frequents salons at Gertrude Steins (Kathy Bates). Gil also begins to fall for Adriana (Marion Cotillard) an impossibly beautiful all-purpose muse who bounces from Modiglianis bed to Picassos to Hemingways. For its first half Midnight in Paris comes close to being a conflict-free fantasy a space of pure play. The encounters between the naive awestruck Gil and his impossibly glamorous literary heroes read like A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthurs Courtby way of Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure (and the luscious production design by Anne Seibel is a time-travel machine all its own). But right around the midpoint a melancholy note creeps in As happened in The Purple Rose of Cairo Allens earlier much deeper exploration of the dangers of the romantic imagination our hero begins to learn that theres no such thing as an ideal era a time free of conflict and regret. Adriana herself idealizes the Belle Epoque of 19th-century Paris; the denizens of that era (as we learn from a too-brief visit with Toulouse-Lautrec and Gauguin at Maxims) disdain their own degraded modernity and look back longingly on the Renaissance. A huge part ofthe charm of Midnight in Paris derives from the finely calibrated casting long one of Allens superpowers as a director. Adrien Brody has a delightful cameo as Salvador Dali who longs to create a Surrealist painting of Gil next to a rhinoceros. And though Zelda Fitzgerald disappears far too quickly after her initial appearance (what better Woody Allen character than the fascinating unstable Zelda?) choosing Alison Pill to play her was a masterstroke. Owen Wilson against all odds makes a sensational Allen proxy--instead of impersonating those famous vocal cadences as Kenneth Branagh did in Celebrity (shudder) he leavens the directors trademark melancholia with his own sunny Texas charm. (Midnight in Paris also makes you realize just how dreadfully Owen Wilson is currently being used by Hollywood. Here we have this smart funny urbane young man in his prime--who also happens to look like a surferboy angel--and were watching him in Marley amp; Me and Hall Pass?) ""Im having an insight"" Gil tells Adriana one night as they whisper behind a red velvet curtain at Maxims. ""Its a minor one but still."" Midnight in Paris is a minor Woody Allen film but still. For a director whose recent work has at times seemed irredeemably contemptuous and bitter (after Whatever Works I almost swore him off for good) this small delicately realized fable feels--appropriately enough--like a visit to another time.

But heres the thing Having suffered through at least two decades of the directors celluloid shrews and floozies I got a big kick out of seeing an elderly lesbian literata play den mother to the films inevitable kvetchy Allen stand-in. That plus a certain amount of wacky time travel makes Midnight in Paris a sweet and lively story and a nicely packaged new outing from a past master who has done little more than repeat himself for at least two decades. As he often has before Allen sets his tale -- a familiar one about a creative type dissatisfied with his rather lucky life -- against the backdrop of a European glamour spot. And as ever Paris appears to have been photographed by the directors travel agent the Eiffel Tower all lit and twinkly against the night sky; the Seine ruffled by a mild summer breeze; the cute bistros filled with stylishly gesticulating Gallic types. Book your flights now. But lo Isnt that Owen Wilson blond and goyische to the gills yet faithfully replicating the put-upon slump of the Allen shoulders the quavering stammers about art vs. success literature vs. Hollywood? And is that Rachel McAdams by his side wasting her abundant talent as yet another incarnation of the philistine feminine -- that ur-bitch whos been bent on dimming the creative light of almost every Woodman since oh Manhattan? Wilsons Gil is a successful screenwriter moping over his stalled Great American Novel while noodling around Paris with his fiancee. The lady (McAdams suitably brittle Inez) wants nothing more than to settle down with her beloved in Malibu and live off his residuals. Neither Inez nor her wealthy Ugly American parents (Mimi Kennedy and John Fuller) can comprehend Gils fondness for the city where he lived before worldly success and disillusionment set in. Enter a joke -- a lone joke but a pretty good one executed by an excellent ensemble of actors. Restlessly roaming the city one evening Gil finds himself transported on the stroke of midnight into 1920s Paris where he tries to get his first draft read by the artists and writers who have influenced him most. All of them naturally come in for some good-natured Catskills-style joshing The Scott Fitzgeralds party compulsively while proclaiming their misery -- Alison Pill makes a wonderfully histrionic Zelda -- while Hemingway (Corey Stoll) picks fights and otherwise demonstrates alpha tendencies. Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) witters on about rhinoceri while in the movies funniest scene a certain Mr. Bunuel (Adrien de Van) comes on mystified by Gils eager interpretation of his most famous film. Gils liberating excursions into the past make for entertaining vaudeville. But everyones a type and the only people doing any real acting are Michael Sheen quietly hilarious as a know-it-all professor who impresses the hell out of Inez and the great Kathy Bates enjoying herself as a cheerfully matter-of-fact Stein who actually gives Gil feedback on his manuscript. It goes without saying though that women Bates age dont qualify as bona fide muses in a Woody Allen movie. Enter vamping a saucer-eyed Marion Cotillard as a Roaring 20s siren who is shacked up with Hemingway and assorted surrealist painters but who if she had her druthers would rather play art groupie in the belle epoque. You get the picture No matter where or when we live we all crave escape to our own private (if mythical) Golden Ages or places. Certainly Allen seems to His Paris comes tarted up in rich browns and golds and his interiors are the handsomely appointed suites of posh hotels. Were he to move his camera a couple of miles -- to say the projects crammed with unemployed immigrants where a more fulfilling life might legitimately be imagined right here and now -- then the existential question his films unfailingly pose as universal would come to look like the petty grievances of a neurotic bourgeoisie. But what does Gil care? Hes in a Woody Allen film and must be compensated for his longings with the firm flesh of a nymph barely out of her teens.

Sony Pictures Classic By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 20 2011 1201 a.m. ET In Woody Allens beguiling and then bedazzling new comedy nostalgia isnt at all what it used to be--its smarter sweeter fizzier and ever so much funnier. From the first note of music over a dark screen--a soprano saxophone played by some ghost of Sidney Bechet--""Midnight in Paris"" teases us into expecting nothing more or less than a charming pastiche of the bits and pieces that pop up in many Woody Allen films. The jazz score from another era introduces scenes of the city--not Manhattan in black-and-white splendor but Paris under a bright summer sun. Then a troubled writer makes his appearance--not the blocked novelist played by Josh Brolin in last years ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" but Gil a hack screenwriter played by Owen Wilson who wants to be a novelist. (He and his prickly fiancee Inez played by Rachel McAdams have joined her parents on what began as a business trip for her father.) To round out the familiar cast of archetypes theres Michael Sheens insufferable Paul a poseur who insists that Versailles means ""a place where the weeds have been pulled."" Watch a clip from ""Midnight in Paris"" starring Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams and Kathy Bates. The conflicts are also familiar and entertaining. The earnestly liberal Gil argues back and forth with his prospective father-in-law a conservative Republican who takes a dim view of him as well as his politics. Paul dismisses Gils nostalgia for a Paris that no longer exists as nothing but denial of the painful present. The name for this malady he announces is ""golden-age thinking."" All of that is well and good but this 44th film written and directed by Mr. Allen--imagine 44 films over four decades--has better poissons to saute. The plot flips at midnight when Gil a solitary wanderer lost in a maze of cobblestone streets spots a black-and-yellow apparition coming around a corner--a huge old Rolls-Royce filled with expat revelers. And not just a Rolls but a magic coach that might have come from a Cocteau fantasy. Once Gil joins the revels his tipsy befuddlement escalates to the innocent astonishment that Mr. Wilson has done so well in the past and does superlatively in Gils present which is interwoven with the fabled past of the Ville-Lumiere. Im starting to write in circles here because Im conflicted myself I dont want to spoil any surprises but I do want to convey the sense of joyous delight that flows from the films time-hops. Maybe the best way of getting into it is by noting that Gil was also the name of the movie actor played by Jeff Daniels in one of my favorite Woody Allen films--one of my favorite films period--""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" The magical moment of that achingly lyrical fantasy comes when Gils character an intrepid archaeologist steps out of the screen and into Mia Farrows grim Depression-era life. In ""Midnight in Paris"" lyricism yields though not entirely to the scintillating lunacy of a wannabe writer stepping into another era and finding himself in the midst of the writers and artists he has worshipped as gods. Cocteau is only one of many. The pianist singing songs with phenomenal lyrics--""in shallow shoals English soles do it""--isnt just a pianist. An American poet introduces himself as Tom. The alpha literary lion of the milieu is Corey Stolls Ernest (Im going along with the first-name-only game played by the credits) a somber self-mythologist who speaks about love and death in run-on sentences and keeps trying to pick fights. Mr. Fitzgeralds hair is impeccably marcelled while Mrs. Fitzgeralds psyche is so tangled that Gil gives her a Valium. (Shes played brilliantly by Alison Pill.) Kathy Bates is not just hilarious shes eerily convincing as Gertrude who of course has Pablos portrait of her hanging in her salon. (Speaking of the dour Pablo Ernest says ""Hes great but hes no Miro."") Gils presence is readily accepted by Adrien Brodys Salvador as well as by Salvadors friends Man and Luis; they see no problem with someone living in two worlds because theyre surrealists. Mr. Allen offers this inspired nonsense with the casual aplomb of an absurdist; its all so silly and such wonderful fun. That changes though when he brings on Adriana an aspiring fashion designer and sometime mistress of various painters in town Pablo among them. Shes as real as the marvelous Marion Cotillard can make her which is to say intensely and for Gil sublimely Adriana is everything his fiancee isnt with the added attraction of being a legend. And through their adventure in another magic coach ""Midnight in Paris"" reconsiders Pauls diagnosis. When was the golden age and why didnt we get to live in it? Its a serious question that the movie has the good grace to take whimsically though theres no contest photographically between present and past. The superb cinematographer Darius Khondji floods his vistas of daytime Paris with light thats gentle but banal while Anne Seibels production design turns several coins de rue into vaguely cheesy movie sets. In the nighttime Paris that Gil explores the colors are rich the shadows are deep the mists promise mystery and serpentine alleys invite the sort of dreamy meanders that suit Gil so well. (Annoyed by his romantic affection for soft summer showers Inez asks early on ""Why does every city have to be in the rain?"" One answer is that cameras love the look of wet pavements.) At the same time the movie gives todays Paris a boost by populating it with women whose intelligence and sensitivity are equal to their beauty. One of them a guide at the Rodin Museum is played by Frances First Lady Carla Bruni. (More than a piquant cameo its a pleasing performance.) Another Lea Seydouxs Gabrielle sells antiques at an outdoor stand and values Gil as a customer with special tastes. ENLARGE Johnny Depps Jack Sparrow accompanied by redcoats in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides. Disney Actors have always been eager to work with Mr. Allen; heres another demonstration of why. Every member of the cast shines at varying intensities Ms. McAdams as a young almost-married whos lively and attractive albeit a scold; Kurt Fuller as Inezs acidulous father; Mimi Kennedy as her dryly sarcastic mother; and in lesser roles Nina Arianda Tom Hiddleston Daniel Lundh and Michel Vuillermoz. But this is Mr. Wilsons picture. Practiced though his trademark naivete may be its entirely fresh once again because hes so good at playing such a complex role. Gil is a bit of a goofball but he is also without knowing it the genuine artist he yearns to be. For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being the film represents new energy in a remarkable career. In recent years Mr. Allens output has been variable; a succession of small mostly agreeable entertainments punctuated by the disagreeable miscalculation of ""Whatever Works"" and the glorious madness of ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona."" Whats new about ""Midnight in Paris""--about its cheerful shallows along with its unstressed depths--is the lovely unseriousness of the whole venture. Just as Luis Bunuel did Woody Allen is growing more playful as he gets older. His new movie truly is a place where the weeds have been pulled. Everything comes up roses. Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides ""Its not the destination so much as the journey"" Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow declares in this latest addition to the theme park ride. For me it was not so much the journey as the destination--the curtained opening beneath the Exit sign--so Im not the one to say whether this film is better or worse than the previous one. Its definitely shorter and more coherent Jack and Geoffrey Rushs Barbossa both sail off to find the Fountain of Youth but Ian McShanes Blackbeard is after it too and not just Blackbeard and his crew of zombies but his daughter Angelica who is played by Penelope Cruz with a what-am-I-doing-here expression on her face. (She looks cute with a moustache.) Watch a clip from ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" starring Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush. Keith Richards in another cameo as Captain Teague asks ""Does this face look like its found the Fountain of Youth?"" Nope it does not. Mr. Depp fulfills his flouncing quota though his deadpan sometimes goes completely dead. The movie was written by ""Pirates"" stalwarts Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Theyre funny guys and the script might well be funny too but its hard to tell from the metronome rhythms set for the actors by the director Rob Marshall and by the editors working as galley slaves under their producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I did like an elaborate swarm of mermaids especially the one who washes up on the movies shores; her name is Syrena with a ""y"" to distinguish her from common sirens and shes played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey. But the IMAX print I saw was so murky as to make you give thanks for the few scenes shot in simple sunlight the 3-D wasnt worth the bother and never before have I wanted to chloroform an entire orchestra. DVD FOCUS Wedding Crashers (2005) Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are John and Jeremy motor-mouthed con men who crash wedding receptions to pick up girls. In the opening scene set in an office where the longtime friends maintain a dubious practice as divorce mediators an aggrieved husband laces into his wife who replies furiously ""You shut your mouth when youre talking to me"" This tidbit of skewed logic is only one bright moment of many in a film blessed with language thats sharply honed if often raunchy. Rachel McAdams is a bridesmaid Claire with whom John falls hopelessly in love. La Vie en Rose (2007) Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her astonishing performance as the tortured impassioned Edith Piaf. In the spirit of Piafs signature song I regret nothing about ""La Vie en Rose""--not the narrative confusion the sketchy details or the lack of historical context. Olivier Dahans long harrowing and phantasmagorical biopic doesnt bother with such events as World War II which slips by unnoticed. This isnt negligence but a reflection of Piafs point of view. Her life was only about singing and searching for love. And always the songs she sang with the intensity of a cyclotron beam. Broken Embraces (2009) Penelope Cruz does her best to act badly during several passages in Pedro Almodovars tragicomedy but her effort is doomed to failure. Shes magnificent even when her performance is supposed to be clumsy and those passages arent what they seem anyway. Theyre part of a wonderfully elaborate joke in a film that serves as a love letter to the movies and a demonstration of the mediums mysterious power. Ms. Cruzs Lena is part of a quadrangle that involves a blind Spanish screenwriter and former director an ominously amorous tycoon and the former directors production assistant. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Midnight in Paris review Woody Allen is in fine funny form in France-set film |       NJ.com comments Midnight in Paris review Woody Allen is in fine funny form in France-set film Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 20 2011 at 700 AM View/Post Comments Roger ArpajouOwen Wilson and Rachel McAdams in ""Midnight in Paris"" Woody Allens most amusing movie in many years. In his bitter 1980 movie ""Stardust Memories"" Woody Allen played a director whose fans insisted he abandon his important new work and get back to his roots. You know those ""earlier funnier movies."" Well that movie character wouldnt like to hear this -- and the real filmmaker may not either. But Allens new ""Midnight in Paris"" is a lot like his earlier funnier movies. And its far and away his sunniest effort since ""Mighty Aphrodite."" The set-in-France film starts with a couple of tried-and-true Allen elements -- the smart creative guy (who worries he isnt realizing his potential) the sexy girlfriend (who is nonetheless exasperating) and the know-it-all third-wheel (who may become a rival). So far so what? But then ... Well wait a second. What happens then is a surprise but also crucial to talking about the movie. On one hand the trailers have kept it under wraps as Allen obviously prefers; on the other early notices have already given it away so perhaps I shouldnt worry. But I do. So if you want to go in unprepared go and join us here online later. If you want to be forewarned keep reading. Because when midnight strikes in the film with it comes a nightly enchantment -- our hero Gil is taken back to his favorite era the Paris of the 20s when women flitted from artist to artist like butterflies and F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway argued ideas. And Gil falls in love -- both with the time and with a lovely disciple of Coco Chanel. This is classic Allen -- longtime fans will remember the wonderful ""A Twenties Memory"" from ""Getting Even"" -- but it gets a nice twist by casting Owen Wilson in the lead. That immediately detours things in a fresh Laid-back Dude direction instead of down the usual Angsty New Yorker avenues. The rest of the large cast -- which ranges from Frances current first lady Carla Bruni to Marion Cotillard as Wilsons new flame -- is fine too. Particularly hysterical are Corey Stoll as a relentlessly macho Hemingway and Adrien Brody as the already odd Dali. Of course some of whats going on here is simple name-dropping (""Tom Eliot? Thomas Stearns Eliot?"") and the real intellectuals -- the ones Allen has always felt in awe of -- will complain of the CliffsNotes cliches and didja-get-it? jokes. (""Djuna Barnes?"" Gil says of one dance partner. ""No wonder she kept trying to lead"") And its true thats what here -- besides the smart observation that we tend to be nostalgic for experiences we never had -- hardly rivals previous Allen fantasies like ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" or ""Zelig."" The films beginning is a bit slow and its happy ending suggests that Allens uncomfortable idealization of girlish females is still alive and unwell. But between that drawn-out start and barely there finish is a lovely little comedy that artfully re-creates two wonderful long-gone pasts -- the 20s of Braque and Bunuel and the 70s of giddy goofy just-thrilled-to-be-amusing Woody. And its a pleasure to have both briefly back. Ratings note The film contains some sexual innuendo. Midnight in Paris (PG-13) Sony Pictures Classics (100 min.) Directed by Woody Allen.

By Roger Arpajou Sony Pictures Classics Inez (Rachel McAdams) and Gil (Owen Wilson) are an engaged couple who both meet new love interests on a trip to Paris. EnlargeClose By Roger Arpajou Sony Pictures Classics Inez (Rachel McAdams) and Gil (Owen Wilson) are an engaged couple who both meet new love interests on a trip to Paris. Bound to go down well with Woody Allen fans its in the vein of 1985s Purple Rose of Cairo though it probably will not be remembered as long as that classic. Although less substantial than his best films its in the top third of the prolific Allens work. And a better-than-average Woody Allen movie can be plenty good indeed. A romantic comedy with elements of magical realism and time travel it has an engaging premise capturing the enchanting beauty of the City of Light. Owen Wilson plays Gil a frustrated TV writer who is engaged to the nagging Inez (Rachel McAdams). The pair tag along on a trip to Paris with her smug ultra-conservative parents (Allen lobs some political zingers at the Tea Party movement via Gil). Caught up in the romance of wandering the city where his favorite writers worked Gil becomes dreamy and remote. Inez grows more shrill and annoyed and is taken with Paul an arrogant intellectual (Michael Sheen). On one of his meandering strolls Gil finds himself transported to the 1920s where he meets Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) F. Scott Fitzgerald (Thors Tom Hiddleston) Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill) and Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) among others. Hemingway introduces him to Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) who dispenses advice on the novel Gil has been quietly writing. About the film Midnight in Paris    out of four Stars Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams Marion Cotillard Kathy Bates Michael Sheen Adrien Brody Director Woody Allen Distributor Sony Pictures Classics Rating PG-13 for some sexual references and smoking Running time1 hour 28 minutes Opens Friday in select cities At Steins house Gil meets Adriana (Marion Cotillard). While he couldnt be happier than he is in 1920s Paris she pines for her golden era the turn-of-the-century La Belle Epoque. As a look at nostalgia and the longing for an idealized past Midnight in Paris has a clear-cut position. When he sees Adriana yearning for a better time Gil realizes no period is idyllic and he can find happiness in the present-day. (Speaking of current events French first lady Carla Bruni Sarkozy has a cameo as a museum guide that is hardly worth the fuss being made of it in France.) Clearly Allen loves Paris and his recent film tour around other European cities (London Barcelona) has provided substantial inspiration and artistic reinvention for a man so associated with New York. Wilson as the Allen surrogate comes off rather tentative. Good as he is in comedies such as Wedding Crashers and Zoolander and Wes Anderson films such as The Royal Tenenbaums hes not completely convincing as a novelist with a passion for Hemingway and Fitzgerald. The familiar dialogue here makes one long for something closer to the edginess of Manhattan or the offbeat humor of Vicky Cristina Barcelona. Midnight in Paris may not transport audiences but as a valentine to Paris its an amiable trip. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Owen Wilson turns out to be the best Woody Allen surrogate by far in the Woodmans ""Midnight in Paris"" a lightly amusing fantasy about a hack screenwriter who gets to hobnob with artistic legends in the City of Light of the 1920s. This riff on one of Woodys long-ago short stories sounds like it might be his most ambitious movie in years but in truth it doesnt come close to fully exploring the comic possibilities of the premise. While it might not be anywhere near as inspired as ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" its entirely possible to enjoy what Id rank as his second best this century (ahead of the highly overrated and self-important ""Match Point"") if you approach it with modest expectations. Wilsons character is visiting Paris with his crass girlfriend (Rachel McAdams) and her parents (the father is described as a ""Tea Party Republican"" in the films sole topical reference). The girlfriend is annoyed at Wilsons desire to stay on in Paris to soak up inspiration for a ""literary"" novel hes writing about a man who works in a nostalgia shop. She wants him to instead cash in with paycheck jobs while hes still hot in Hollywood. Walking the cobblestone streets one midnight Wilson is beckoned into an antique car and whisked to a party with flappers and men in formal dress. As Cole Porter sings at the piano hes astounded to find himself chatting with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Through means that Allen never spells out and Wilson never much questions our hero is able to return to his beloved 20s every midnight. On his second visit hes taken to the salon of Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) who gives wise counsel on his novel. She also introduces him to a young woman (Marion Cotillard) who has been serving as a serial mistress to major artists (currently Picasso). The two quickly fall in love though sadly Cotillard and Wilson have no chemistry together whatsoever -- and it turns out that Cotillard finds the 20s ""boring"" and is herself nostalgic . . . for the 1890s. Wilson is a vast improvement over such dubious ersatz Woodys as Edward Norton (""Everyone Says I Love You"" also set in Paris) Kenneth Branagh Will Ferrell and John Cusack. In his best performance since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" Wilson wraps his Texan drawl around Woodys one-liners and delivers even the wheeziest of them with panache. Its pretty hard not to grin when he offers the troubled Zelda a Valium though the writer-director resolutely refuses to consider the possibility that Wilson might be altering the time-space continuum. Besides Wilson and Bates the only actor who manages to get past a one-note caricature is Adrien Brody in a hilarious unbilled cameo as Salvador Dali. McAdams and Michael Sheen (""The Queen"") as her pompous art-professor ex-boyfriend have truly thankless roles. French star Lea Seydoux turns up briefly as a charming art peddler while French First Lady Carla Bruni has a superfluous cameo as a tour guide. Though it never ventures past the tourist quarters of Paris this is one of Woodys most handsomely photographed movies. A quarter-century ago his thematically similar ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" found genuine emotion in its fantasy world. The earlier film was a lustrous oil painting compared to a glib charcoal sketch like ""Midnight in Paris."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next NBC Sports chief Ebersol resigns Read Next NBC Sports chief Ebersol resigns Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 35133 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 22493 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 19071 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Sony Pictures Classics/AP) Joe Neumaier Friday May 20 2011 400 AM Title Midnight in Paris Its rare to see great artists truly enjoying themselves as the hero of Woody Allens latest ""Midnight in Paris"" has the chance to do.Luckily audiences get to see Allen himself doing the same thing with this lighthearted but thoughtful comedy the New York filmmakers most satisfying work since ""Bullets Over Broadway.""""Midnight"" recalls that 1994 film as well as ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" and ""Play It Again Sam."" Yet its even more effortless. The idea has likely been in Allens head since forever but its arrived at the right moment.Gil (Owen Wilson) is a screenwriter on vacation in Paris with his sexy but shallow fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams). He is of course experiencing a crisis Being in the City of Light reminds him of the novelist he once hoped to be.It doesnt help that they keep running into Inezs friend Paul (Michael Sheen) an insufferable know-it-all.Wandering the streets one night an old car rolls up to the curb and Gil is beckoned by the passengers to climb in. The auto it seems is a sort of portal to other periods and when Gil shuts its door hes in the 1920s rubbing elbows with Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill) and Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll).He gets incomprehensible advice on love from Salvador Dali (Adrien Brody) and writing tips from Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). And he falls in love with the smoky-eyed sad-voiced Adriana (a beguiling Marion Cotillard) a muse for Picasso with her own yearnings for previous eras.By day Gil tries to connect with the superficial Inez but cant wait to return to the Jazz Age where he fits in. And somewhere in time Adriana is restless; no matter the year antsy souls want to be any place except where they are.As in ""Purple Rose"" the film works best when tweaking the disparate worlds thrown together though ""Midnight"" is frothier and so Wilson shines. Hes the best young Allen stand-in since John Cusack and he plays nicely off all the cameos from historical heavyweights.The casting of those is spot-on. Stoll wins big as a kind of quote-machine Hemingway a hard-drinking brawling alpha male with a penchant for declarative statements. Pills an intoxicating Zelda Brody is a loony hoot and Bates appears to be having a ball.If the modern-day scenes feel forced its because of Allens late-career difficulties writing authentic-sounding dialogue. Then the other Allen -- the guy with the ear for great one-liners an eye for ensembles and an affection for screwball romance -- shows up and were borne back into the past for a grand time indeed.

"Midnight in Paris | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; midnight-in-paris ) Midnight in Paris (Spain/United States 2011) May 19 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli From time-to-time I suppose we all succumb to daydreams of what it might be like to have lived during a different perhaps simpler era. Filmmaker Woody Allen whose cinematic recipes have often incorporated more than a pinch of nostalgia embraces this conceit with his 2011 effort Midnight in Paris. An odd creation by some standards this production is neither pure drama nor true comedy. It is too light and airy to touch the emotions in more than a fleeting fashion and its humor is gentle and low-key rarely exhibiting the edge associated with Allen. Instead Midnight in Paris is a fairy tale a parfait of whimsy. The film is constructed in such a way that suspension of disbelief isnt too hard because theres something universal in what Allen explores. Like Santa Claus we know its not real but the idea is so appealing that we go along with the fantasy. Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are taking a pre-wedding vacation in Paris. It doesnt take many scenes for us to become aware that as a couple they are mismatched. Hes a simple guy who dreams of living a bohemian life. Despite being a successful Hollywood screenwriter he yearns to move to Paris and write a novel - a notion the materialistic Inez scoffs at. One night instead of going out dancing with his fiancA(c) and her ""pedantic"" friend Paul (Michael Sheen) Gil opts to wander the streets of Paris. Shortly after midnight an old-time roadster pulls up alongside him and a group of party-goers motion for him to get in. He finds himself transported to another era - a between-the-wars City of Lights where he can keep company with F. Scott Fitzgerald (Tom Hiddleston) Ernest Hemmingway (Carey Stoll) Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates) and the alluring Adriana (Marion Cotillard). Before dawn approaches Gil finds himself returned to the modern world but his time traveling excursions are not over. For the most part the story of Midnight in Paris is undemanding especially for those who are familiar with tales of time travel (or who watch Doctor Who which is the level of ""science fiction"" upon which Midnight in Paris resides). No attempt is made to explain the mechanism by which Gil wanders into his time warp - it simply happens. This is appropriate since applying any sort of reason to magic always feels forced and frequently sounds silly. Midnight in Paris is about mood emotion and tone. Allen frequently employs long unbroken takes in which the roving camera makes us a fly on the wall. (These are not the shaky cam techniques that made watching some of Allens early-90s films difficult.) The movies Paris is the city of post cards and romantic movies. Allen opens the film with images of many famous tourist spots as a cloudy day gives way to a rainy evening. The sequence is Midnight in Paris most evocative. The production fails to come up to the level of Allens great movies but there havent been many of those in recent years. Its an entertaining trifle that is at least as engaging as and perhaps more likeable than a majority of the filmmakers recent excursions. However while filming in the City of Lights may have ignited Allens visual instincts it did not result in a superior screenplay. The dialogue lacks verve and the wit is muted. Perhaps Midnight in Paris is wish-fulfillment for Allen and the thought of so many literary and artistic luminaries in one place results in an unusual level of respect. Owen Wilsons Gil is Midnight in Paris Allen stand-in. Occasionally one can almost hear Woody speaking the lines. Gil however is not a neurotic which makes for a pleasant change; this allows the character to be more sympathetic and independent that the usual protagonist in an Allen movie. Gil has two love interests. The one in the present his fiancA(c) Inez is played by Rachel McAdams with all the charm of a coiled snake (or that of Katherine Heigl). Marion Cotillards Adriana however is the kind of alluring muse who might make any person think of giving up television computers and the benefits of modern technology. Many of the secondary performers - Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali Carey Stoll as Ernest Hemmingway - are scene-stealers. Allen gets the best out of these actors as they step into the shoes of icons. He also gives Frances First Lady Carla Bruni a speaking part. (Shes the tour guide who translates Adrianas diary into English.) One oddity about Midnight in Paris is Allens insistence upon making this a true fairy tale by giving it a moral. The message which has to do with being content in the present isnt merely sitting in the subtext waiting to be discovered by a discerning viewer. Instead it is broadcast with all the subtlety of a day-glo neon sign so even a dullard who sleeps through half the movie will get it. Rarely has Allen come across as so preachy. Words like ""pleasant"" ""enjoyable"" and ""undemanding"" apply to Midnight in Paris although some may consider that damning with faint praise - especially those who look to Woody Allen to cast a cynical eye on the foibles of a man in love. Allens movies often deal with love and sex and although he often dabbles in nostalgia rarely does he do so with such unabashed romanticism. Midnight in Paris does not challenge greatness but its a nice low-key way to spend 100 minutes.

"Midnight in Paris Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Midnight in ParisWoody Allens film is his warmest mellowest and funniest venture in years.May 20 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Owen Wilson in Woody Allens movie ""Midnight in Paris."" (Sony Pictures Classics )Heres a sentence I never thought Id write again Woody Allen has made a wonderful new picture ""Midnight in Paris"" and its his best most enjoyable work in years. If youre surprised to be reading that think how I feel writing it. Ive been a tough sell on the past dozen or so Allen films very much including the well-acted but finally wearying ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" It seemed that everything he touched in recent years was tainted by misanthropy and sourness. Until now. With ""Midnight in Paris"" Allen has lightened up allowed himself a treat and in the process created a gift for us and him. His new film is simple and fable-like with a definite ""when you wish upon a star"" quality but bolstered by appealing performers like Owen Wilson Marion Cotillard and Rachel McAdams it is his warmest mellowest and funniest venture in far too long. This is also a film with an unanticipated twist so the less you know about it the better. Try to see it immediately before well-meaning friends tell you more than they should. ""Midnight in Paris"" is too charming to be ruined by anything but this is a case where ignorance really is bliss. Allen says hes been enamored of Paris since he wrote and acted in ""Whats New Pussycat?"" in 1965. You can sense his continued passion for the city throughout the film feel the extra pep in his step and pleasure in his heart. Seductively shot by Darius Khondji (whatever tax credits this film got will be paid back with interest) ""Midnight"" opens with an extended montage of Paris tourist landmarks a montage that lasts longer than necessary to simply establish location. Allen is saying Pay attention a this is a special place a place where magic can happen. Thats certainly the attitude of Gil (Wilson) a successful Hollywood screenwriter who is an effusive enthusiast for the City of Light in general and the 1920s golden age of Fitzgerald-Hemingway Paris in particular. So much so that Gil dreams of turning his back on all that studio money and writing novels on the Left Bank. Gils fiancA(c)e Inez (McAdams) doesnt like the sound of that. She and Gil are in Paris accompanying her wealthy parents on a business trip and she doesnt even want to think about anything that would diminish Gils income. Gils raptures are put on hold when he and Inez bump into Inezs friend Paul (Michael Sheen) and his wife. A professor whom Inez once had a crush on Paul is in Paris to lecture at the Sorbonne. Its soon clear hes an insufferable bore so pedantic he gets into an argument with a guide at the Rodin Museum (a brief cameo for French First Lady Carla Bruni). As much to escape Paul as anything else Gil takes a late-night walk and just as the clock strikes midnight on the Rue Montagne St. Genevieve something happens that throws everything in Gils life into disarray. Perhaps most unsettling but in a good way is Gils meeting with the beautiful and spirited Adriana (Cotillard) an aspiring fashion designer who has a history of inspiring artists. The connection between them is immediate but the barriers to any kind of relationship are formidable. With remarkable naturalness and considerable charisma Cotillard is just as she should be here as are both Wilson one of the most likable of contemporary actors and McAdams who deftly handles a part that is less amiable than usual for her. Also great fun in smaller roles are Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody as well as French stars Lea Seydoux and Gad Elmaleh. On display as well is Allens sharp and satisfying script. It makes jokes about everyone from Djuna Barnes to Luis Bunuel but also takes time to ponder the role of the artist and the importance of not undervaluing the age we live in. More than anything obviously ""Midnight"" has Paris. For one film at least that extraordinary city has changed Allens mood and altered his outlook on cinema and life.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet An unassuming wisp of a movie Midnight In Paris finds Woody Allen penning a love letter to the City Of Lights albeit one whose sentiments could easily fit on a postcard. In fact the movie often appears to aspire to postcard status particularly in an opening series of establishing shots of familiar Parisian sites progressing from dawn to dusk with a picturesque afternoon shower thrown in for good measure. With pretty photography by Darius Khondji and a lovely piece of vintage jazz for a soundtrack it recalls the opening moments of Allens Manhattan only drained of the poetry and urgency. Which is fine since any other approach would feel like false advertising. Its the sort of movie in which the protagonist brags that hes arrived at a ""minor insight."" He might as well be asking the audience to pat the movie on the head for arriving at the same. Surprisingly effective as the films Allen proxy Owen Wilson stars as a successful screenwriter who dreams of ditching Hollywood focusing on polishing his novel and walking around with a baguette under his arm which is apparently what one does in Paris when not drinking in cafes penning fiction or visiting the Musee Rodin. As the latest in a long line of the interchangeable materialistic shrews to populate Allens later films (with a few happy exceptions like Vicky Cristina Barcelona) Rachel McAdams objects to this plan dragging Wilson along on unpleasant outings with her conservative parents or a know-it-all professor (an amusingly unbearable Michael Sheen) as she makes plans for a house in Malibu and all the pleasures Hollywood money allows. Then one night Wilson gets lost hops into a vintage Peugeot filled with partygoers in 1920s attire and ends up transported through time and hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway Picasso Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald and many others. So begins a series of journeys to a time when literary musical and artistic giants rubbed shoulders argued and did the Charleston. Allen realizes them with breezy enthusiasm and wax-museum attention to detail. A few actors--particularly Alison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald and Kathy Bates as Gertrude Stein--get under their famous characters skins but Allen is mostly content to work in broad strokes in recreating one of Paris most-storied periods. Its all in service of exposing the fallacy of pining for a lost Golden Age--thats the minor insight both film and protagonist reach--but the film makes it hard for fans of Allens past work not to engage in some Golden Age thinking. Hes dealt with the allure of fantasy and the pull of history with much more depth and consideration in his own past in films like Zelig and The Purple Rose Of Cairo. His latest is entertaining enough but unmistakably the work of a later lesser era.

One could argue that Allens beloved New York City doesnt exist either -- that his Manhattan is a state of mind and an exclusive zip code populated by Allen-esque characters less likely to visit Queens than Qatar. This Paris though really exists solely in the mind reachable each night only at the stroke of 12. Thats when Gil (Owen Wilson in a slower-speed version of the Woody role) slips into a twilight zone. Hes a Hollywood screenwriter on a pre-wedding Parisian jaunt with his fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams miscast as a status-conscious shrew) and when the clock towers go gong he comes face-to-face with great France-based writers and artists of an earlier golden era. Suddenly this West Coast hack is a serious aspiring novelist on a first-name basis with Ernest Hemingway Zelda and F. Scott Fitzgerald Gertrude Stein Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali. Gil even finds a beautiful muse/mistress (Marion Cotillard) who treats him with the kind of sultry adoration she only bestows on geniuses. Allen has fun in his imaginary French capital turning his star-studded cast loose to interpret their characters as they wish. Some swim others flounder. (Kathy Bates and Adrien Brody bite into their roles as Stein and Dali; Carla Bruni the wife of French president Nicolas Sarkozy is less assured as a modern-day tour guide.) But even as Allen goes further than hes ever dared toward acknowledging his weakness for nostalgia the movie still confuses easy travelogue photography -- pretty pics of France for distractible Americans -- with dynamic filmmaking. ""Well always have Paris"" the director suggests. Oui so long as we think of Paris as a joke about Scott and Zelda -- and a beauty shot of the Eiffel Tower.

The couple has accompanied her parents on a trip to Paris in advance of the wedding and if Gil who once gave up a chance to live there for real had his way theyd never leave. ""I tell ya"" he tells his future wife ""if I had just stayed here and written novels instead of getting into that whole grind of writing movie scripts . . ."" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The latest in a long line of actors playing a ""Woody Allen type"" in a Woody Allen film Wilson bends his own recognizably nasal Texan drawl into an exaggerated pattern of staccatos and glissandos thats obviously modeled on the writer/directors near-musical verbal cadences; the word ""lunatic"" for instance begins with a long hard ""LEW"" modulated over three connecting notes. His performance--""Woody Allen"" in quotes and beach-blond drag--adds an extra layer of distance to a script thick with allegory. A deceptively light time-travel romance Midnight in Paris uses fairy-tale devices as a way to get to the filmmakers familiar real-life-sourced themes desire as both magical salve and instigator of insanity and the fear of death that makes us forget past miseries just long enough to pursue pleasures thatll almost surely end in pain.One night as Inez flirts with an obnoxiously pedantic American academic (Michael Sheen) Gil drunkenly wanders off alone. A car pulls up the strangers inside offer him a ride and the next thing we know he is at a bizarre party full of flappers dancing to Cole Porter. When a vivacious young couple introduce themselves as Scott and Zelda he comes to understand that hes been transported to Paris circa the 1920s. Before the night is through he begins a flirtation with Adriana (Marion Cotillard) a stunning serial muse and forges a bond with Ernest Hemingway (Corey Stoll) who offers to show Gils novel-in-progress to his good friend and mentor Gertrude Stein (Kathy Bates). Gil runs out to grab his manuscript--and promptly gets lost in the present day. But the next night the clock strikes midnight another mysterious car drives up and Gil is once again transported to his personal nostalgic paradise.Allen only lightly milks the sci-fi potential of his premise barely probing into the wonky details of how Gils presence in the past could alter the space-time continuum. (The one time his reticence feels like a missed opportunity when Gil gives Zelda Fitzgerald a Valium and she subsequently disappears from the film.) The high concept is a means not an end Allen sends Gil traveling through time not because hes terribly interested in the mechanics and fantastic possibilities of inter-dimensional travel but because its a backdoor way to investigate the problem of time--our inability to slow it down or stop it to make anything good last or prevent inevitable misery--within ordinary life.Shot by Darius Khondji (who collaborated with Allen on the much-maligned Anything Else) Midnight is a striking study in aesthetic contrasts. The present day is white fluorescent blindingly bright--the atmospheric equivalent of a hangover. In the past its permanently just-pre-last call and every room pulses softly with smoky amber light. No wonder Gil drunk on the rush of being able to control his transport through time (and often just drunk) gets cocky and attempts to close the gap between past and present for the first time in his life going after what he really thinks will make him happy.But ephemerality proves to be a curse in every epoch. Allen--whose contemporary output is often unfairly dismissed as trifling even though his films of the 00s have been shot through with an intense cumulative despair as often as theyve been shot thanks to the miracles of foreign financing and tax credits--gives the episodic ebb and flow of satisfaction an unexpectedly upbeat spin. Or does he? Midnight concludes with a rushed coupling that could be read as falsely optimistic. Or maybe its just the beginning of another crest of hope and momentary joy doomed to dissipate just after the end credits--or more likely in the next film.1 Carla Bruni-Sarkozy and ""Woody Allen""Sony Pictures Classics Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Karina Longworth Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Its a Good Woody Allen Movie No really Midnight in Paris is genuinely graceful and light-footed. By David Edelstein Published May 15 2011 ShareThis (Photo Roger Arpajou/Mediapro/Versatil Cinema/Gravier Productions/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) Given that Woody Allens imaginative universe has long been a closed ecosystem (no contemporary culture can penetrate a defensive shell hardened by such determined phobias) its a miracle he can still turn out a movie as disarming as Midnight in Paris. This supernatural comedy isnt just Allens best film in more than a decade; its the only one that manages to rise above its tidy parable structure and be easy graceful and glancingly funny as if buoyed by its befuddled heros enchantment. That hero Gil is played by Owen Wilson and hes finer than any male actor who has ever stood in for Allenfiner than Allen often has been too. Gil is a successful Hollywood screenwriter who considers himself a hack and wants to write novels preferably in Paris where hes on holiday with his go-go fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams). And if he had his druthers hed be doing it in Paris in the twenties alongside Scott and Zelda Hemingway Gertrude Stein Cole Porter Picasso Cocteau and all those other giants living large yet somehow creating enduring works of art. Yammering about Paris in what Gil considers its golden age while Inez scoffs Wilson is wide-eyed without being fatuous and lines that could sound like lazily reflexive Yiddish-inflected gripes become philosophical and urgent. His stammer is never shtick. It wasnt until Wilsons apparent suicide attempt that some of us finally identified the vein of wistfulness under the stoner cool the longing for definition behind the spaciness. As Gil this straw-haired Texan makes Allens rhythmsalong with Allens essential disappointment at living in the here and nowhis own. The mechanism by which Gil travels back (via vintage automobile at midnight) to his beloved era goes happily unexplained thus eliminating the sci-fi wheels and pulleys that tend to suck up so much screen time in time-travel movies. Allen just breezes past all that the way he did in his great The Purple Rose of Cairo and before that in his 1977 short story The Kugelmass Episode. Actually the twenties scenes recall another Allen story A Twenties Memory which is full of passages as blissful as this Hemingway had just finished two short stories about prize fighting and while Gertrude Stein and I both thought they were decent we agreed they still needed much work We laughed a lot and had fun and then we put on some boxing gloves and he broke my nose. Allen doesnt do much with Scott (Tom Hiddleston) and Zelda (Alison Pill)perhaps hes too in awe of them. (They do loom large.) But his Hemingway played with forthright manly-manliness by Corey Stoll is riotously funny and as Gertrude Stein Kathy Bates proves that one earnest straight person can be more treasurable than a thousand clowns. Allen holds his trump card until the halfway mark when a celestial vision appears as if sprung from the sub-sub-basement of a turgid Christopher Nolan picture Marion Cotillard as Adriana mistress to the star-artists of the twenties and so unfathomably gorgeous that she doesnt seem to be of this or any era. Cotillard is a true showstopper She creates her own cinematic present. Allen has become such a fluid craftsman that the occasional off notes dont matter too much. Having to work so fast (and cheap) has freed him from what might have been a hell of Kubrickian fussiness. Write it shoot it edit it move on to the next one and dont stop because if you do you may not ever be able to start again. Like many of Woody Allens films Midnight in Paris ends with a moral this time vaguely self-deprecating with an anti-nostalgia kick Everyone wishes that he or she lived in another era even people in that other era. It hurts because we know from Allens frames of reference that hes often lost in pipe dreams of the past. But its possible theres another kind of nostalgia at work in Midnight in Paris not just longing for the Parisian twenties but for the days in which Allen regularly turned out freewheeling pitch-perfect parodies like this.

Woody Allens latest travelogue-cum-arthouse-truffle takes a jaunty turn down memory lane as a frustrated writers premarital trip to Paris whisks him away to headier times when the likes of Fitzgerald Faulkner and Picasso drank smoked and danced the Charleston in the City of Lights. Like a swoony lost chapter from ""Paris je taime"" agreeably extended to feature length ""Midnight in Paris"" is so baldly smitten with its rain-slicked environs you half expect to see Paris tourism office listed among its backers. Yet and still theres an undeniably populist appeal light as meringue and twice as sweet in the pics arms-reach sophistication. Though the films time-traveling secret was kept under wraps pre-Cannes Sony Pictures Classics would do well to embrace it before releasing the pic on May 20 in the U.S. The device itself kicks in just as the second reel is picking up speed injecting the right dash of magic into what might otherwise have been another of Allens flouncy Euro-chic getaways. The plot itself has the simplicity of fable with nostalgia-stricken scribbler Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) getting a unique chance to pal around with his 20s-era idols at the expense of being able to embrace the promise of his own era. Like many an Allen protag Gil doubts his own intellect. Part stuttering stand-in for the director part shallow West Coast caricature Gil specializes in screenplays but aspires to putting his name on a novel. Hes written one about a fellow who yearns for an earlier time -- that ever-elusive ""Golden Age"" that always seems a generation or two before. For Allen it dates back to the Jazz Age finally allowing him to use his favorite tunes in their original context. Showing neither affection nor support Gils insufferable fiancee Inez (a disappointingly flat Rachel McAdams) humors her husband-to-be but spends most of their Paris vacation fawning over a former crush (Michael Sheen) who smugly schools anyone within earshot. ""Hes so knowledgeable"" Inez coos while unpretentious Gil squirms with discomfort. Gil would clearly rather be exploring the city solo and that evening finds him wandering Montmartre when the clock strikes midnight and a classic Peugeot pulls up full of insistent young strangers. The retro-dressed revelers beckon inviting Gil along for an evening of carousing with yesterdays heroes -- the A-list of literary music and art stars who rubbed elbows in 1920s Paris. Rather than reveal the identities of his newfound friends further suffice to say that Gil enjoys a rare audience with the eras intellectual heavyweights whose low-key entrances become something of a running joke (as does the mix of lookalikes and Oscar-winning stars Allen enlists to play them). Returning night after night Gil relishes his spot among this chummy fraternity of cultural giants growing increasingly dissatisfied with the shrill realities of his future wife and in-laws (Kurt Fuller and Mimi Kennedy giving their best Alan Alda and Diane Keaton impersonations). But as New York writer Luc Sante once warned ""Nostalgia can be generally defined as a state of inarticulate contempt for the present and fear of the future."" Gil wrestles with just this frustration until the scripts pat epiphany sets in with the character disowning the present as he wallows in the insecurity of his own talent. While Inez ignores him a fetching French dame (Marion Cotillard once again capitalizing on her classic good looks) worships Gil immediately recognizing his genius from the first line of his manuscript. Such is the ego-stroking role Allen expects of his women with special respect shown Zelda Fitzgerald (Alison Pill) for propping up her man. No doubt Inez would be a worthier character if only hed written her to be more combative though the less time the story spends in the present the more fun the picture proves. If ""Midnight in Paris"" feels like another of Allens one-way fantasies it ultimately manages to get off easy thanks to Wilsons unassuming charm. In one or two uncanny moments the actor looks enough like Allen to trigger a quick double-take but mostly Wilson makes the role endearingly his own grinning and nodding his shaggy head until you fear it might fall off. Hes more re-actor than actor here which works fine in a context where he is surrounded by the eras most famous faces (Corey Stoll proves especially commanding as Hemingway at his most earnest). In essence the director worries about death so the rest of us dont have to spinning such concerns in such a way that the rest of us can sleep easy -- and enjoy a laugh in the process. Comparing oneself to the titans who came before can be crippling on creativity though Allen soldiers on and time will no doubt prove that even these later lighter pretty-city escapes will outlive the attempts of lesser talents.

TWITTER Literary giants of the 1920s and Owen Wilson interact in Woody Allens love letter to the City of Light. As beguiling as a stroll around Paris on a warm spring evening -- something that Owen Wilsons character here becomes very fond of himself -- Midnight in Paris represents Woody Allens companion piece to his The Purple Rose of Cairo a fanciful time machine that allows him to indulge playfully in the artistic Paris of his and many other peoples dreams.  A sure-fire source of gentle amusement to Allens core audience but unlikely to connect with those with no knowledge of or feel for the Paris of the Fitzgeralds Hemingway Gertrude Stein and Picasso this love letter to the City of Light looks to do better-than-average business for the writer-director in the U.S. upon its May 20 release and expectations in certain foreign territories could be even higher. As has happened before when Allen has filmed in photogenic foreign locales -- London in Match Point Barcelona in Vicki Cristina Barcelona -- the director seems stimulated by discovering the possibilities of a new environment. In fact Allen has worked in Paris before as a writer and actor in Whats New Pussycat? 46 years ago and in one section of Everyone Says I Love You but this is the first time hes given the city the royal treatment. Granted its mostly a touristic view of the city as witness the voluptuously photographed opening montage of famous sites but thats entirely acceptable given that the leading characters are well-off Americans on vacation. Playing Allens alter ego this time around is Owen Wilson as Gil a highly successful hack Hollywood screenwriter still young enough to feel pangs over not having seriously tested himself as a novelist. That things may not be entirely right between Gil and his pushy fiancee Inez (Rachel McAdams) becomes clear early on as the couple tours around with Inezs friends Carol (Nina Arianda) and Paul (Michael Sheen) the latter an insufferable expert on all things cultural (that Inezs parents are right-wingers also allows Allen to sneak in some Tea Party jokes).  ""Nostalgia is denial"" Paul intones to Gil who is keen to break off on his own to indulge his own reveries of the literary Paris that fuels his creative imagination. Lo and behold that night while wandering through a quiet part of the city Gil is invited into an elegant old car carrying some inebriated revelers. Arriving at an even more elegant party Gil shortly finds that hes in the company of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and that its Cole Porter playing the piano. Later they end up at a bar with Ernest Hemingway who promises to show Gils unfinished novel to Gertrude Stein. And so begins a flight of fancy that allows Gil to circulate with and receive a measure of approval from his lifelong literary heroes not to mention such other giants as Dali (a vastly amusing Adrien Brody) Picasso Man Ray T.S. Eliot and Luis Bunuel to whom the young American gives the premise of The Exterminating Angel. If not more important he also meets the beauteous Adriana (Marion Cotillard) the former lover of Braque and Modigliani whos now involved with Picasso will shortly go off with Hemingway but is also curiously receptive to Gil who seems somehow different than everyone else. After trying but failing to bring the balky Inez along through the midnight portal along with him Gil keeps returning to the 1920s night after night getting pertinent advice from Stein about his novel and becoming seriously distracted by Adriana who herself would prefer to have lived during La Belle Epoque. Although its all done glibly in traditional Allen one-liner style the format nonetheless allows the writer who has never been shy about honoring his idols in his work to reflect on the way people have always idealized earlier periods and cultural moments as if they were automatically superior to whatever exists at the time.  ""Surely you dont think the 20s is a Golden Age?"" Adriana asks a bewildered Gil who has always been so certain of it. ""Its the present. Its dull"" she insists. For anyone whose historical and cultural fantasies run anywhere near those that Allen toys with here Midnight in Paris will be a pretty constant delight. As Allen surrogates go Wilson is a pretty good one being so different from the author physically and vocally that theres little possibility of the annoying traces of imitation that have sometimes afflicted other actors in such roles. Cotillard is the perfect object of Gils romantic and creative dreams; Kathy Bates speaking English French and Spanish makes Stein into a wonderfully appealing straight-shooter Sheen has fun with his fatuous walking encyclopedia role and McAdams is a bundle of argumentative energy in a role one is meant to find a bit off-putting. French first lady Carla Bruni is perfectly acceptable in her three scenes as a tour guide at the Rodin Museum while Corey Stoll very nicely pulls off the trick of both sending up Hemingways manly pretentions and honestly conveying his core artistic values. Darius Khondjis cinematography evokes to the hilt the gorgeously inviting Paris of so many peoples imaginations (while conveniently ignoring the rest) and the film has the concision and snappy pace of Allens best work.

Images of the Eiffel Tower strolls along the Champs-Elysees close-ups on the Arc de Triomphe which gracefully segue into the glass pyramids of the Louvre -- Allen has thrown in all the iconic imagery that makes Paris as much an ideal as it is a city. Its also clear from the opening that were headed for one of Allens lighter works tonally though thats no ding on the overall effectiveness. Midnight in Paris is a real treat a buttery and flaky croissant with a carafe of red wine thrown in to satisfy adult sensibilities. Owen Wilson as Gil Pender embodies the concept that is Paris. Hes whimsical prone to long walks and desperately seeking to capture the magic and romance of the city. Hes a Hollywood screenwriter who dreams of finishing a great novel to do something of substance much in the same way that great novelists want to break into screenwriting to do something of commercial significance. Owen is engaged to Rachel McAdams and they are visiting Paris while he puts the finishing touches on his novel. Shes not exactly supportive as she thinks struggling to write a novel is silly when screenwriting is so lucrative though she is looking forward to both their nuptials and starting a life back in Malibu California. One evening Wilson goes on a solo walk the clock strikes midnight an old-timey car approaches him and hes magically transported back to the roaring 20s in Paris the ""golden age"" hes been seeking all along. The luminaries he runs across are part of what make Midnight in Paris special F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald Ernest Hemingway Pablo Picasso Salvador Dali and many more; he has small moments with each in-jokes for the literati abound. Hemingway (played by Corey Stoll) in particular is delightful hes pointed and brusque but full of courage and honor much like his masterful prose and the man himself. Wilson takes the whole time travel element in stride overjoyed at the fact that hes getting to meet his inspirations. It plays out like a fantasy camp for Wilson with Gertrude Stein offering to read his novel Dali stopping him for a chat in a bar Cole Porter tickling the ivory for his listening pleasure. A cornucopia of intellectual enchantment is at his disposal and he savors every moment. Marion Cotillard plays Adriana muse to Picasso and Hemingway the latter of whom asks her ""Do you know what its like to shoot a charging lion?"" Whimsy city but in a pleasant way. Meanwhile back in present day McAdams becomes increasingly frustrated with his random midnight walkabouts. She begins spending time with  a friend she knows in Paris Paul (Michael Sheen) who is an expert on everything from wine to art. The Sheen-McAdams-Wilson dynamic is fantastic; laughs are plentiful as Sheen keeps upping the intellectual ante on Wilson a romantic man who just wants to be swept away in the moment. Sheen plays Paul as ""that guy"" the guy who knows everything the guy who might be hitting on your girl the guy who finds the 59 version of the wine a bit too tannin-filled. You know a jerk though in this case the pedantic blowhard adds plenty of wry wit to an already clever story. The dialogue throughout Midnight in Paris is also crisp and packed with levity. At one point Wilson attempts an aside he hems and haws before McAdams mercilessly cuts him off with a ""Thats it? Thats the ending to your story?"" to which Wilson parries ""That wasnt a story it was a detail."" But the main thrust and cohesion of the film can be found in all the 20s action an era Wilson visits regularly. The age-old debate of ""When is Paris at its most lovely?"" is finally settled and the types of personalities that would and wouldnt walk in the rain are fully parsed. Theres also a smallish role for Carla Bruni she of Sarkozy wifedom and she acquits herself well. Sweet sentimental and vibrant Woody Allens Midnight in Paris rightfully points out that yesterdays frolicking bar might be todays laundry mat ... but we can always visit the good times in our memories. The same could be said of Woody Allens work in general -- when its good its very good indeed which is precisely why our cultural memory holds him in such esteem ... and why we choose to visit our favorite moments often and with affection.
