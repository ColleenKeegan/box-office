Comments (2) Dawn of the Dead Given the greatness of George Romeros 1978 independently made classic--in which cannibal zombies besiege a shopping mall where a clutch of still-human survivors is making its last stand--I feared what a studio remake of this apocalyptic thriller would be like. The new version has its share of disturbing moments but writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder have stripped away the social satire of the original and put little in its place. Sometimes the film seems a commentary on the ease with which humanity slips into barbarism at other times a slip into barbarism itself. But if you leave when the end credits begin youll miss further plot developments. With Sarah Polley Ving Rhames Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer. R 90 min.

"Dawn of the Dead | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dawn-of-the-dead ) Dawn of the Dead (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli It takes guts to remake a movie that is commonly considered a classic. Of course that hasnt stopped filmmakers in the past - attempts have been made to modernize such ""untouchables"" as Casablanca and Its a Wonderful Life with predictably unfortunate results. George Romeros 1978 followup to his classic Night of the Living Dead is not in the same class as either of those titles but it is viewed by many horror fans as a seminal genre feature. In addition to Tom Savinis groundbreaking blood and gore Dawn of the Dead is often cited for its allegorical aspects (zombies equating to mindless consumers). Pardon me if I stray from the mainstream in my opinion of the movie. I am not a fan of the original Dawn of the Dead. I find it to be badly acted overlong and silly instead of scary. (And its not that all 70s horror leaves me cold - the original Halloween released at just about the same time has withstood the passage of years.) Putting aside the satire of consumer consumption freshman director Zack Snyders remake is superior in many ways. Actually calling this version of Dawn of the Dead a remake is applying a misnomer. Its more of a re-imagination. The premise and circumstances are similar to those of Romeros picture but the specifics are different. Having seen the 1978 movie doesnt mean that you will be able to predict the outcome of the 2004 version since very few of the same things happen. The ending in particular is different - especially the unprecedented way in which Snyder arrives at it. Those who bolt from their seats the moment the closing credits begin will leave with a much different impression of the resolution than those who stay to the bitter end. Interspersed between screens filled with names are Blair Witch Project-style video clips that extend the story. Shame on multiplexes that bring up the house lights early The movie transpires in the city of Everett Wisconsin where a mysterious epidemic is running rampant through the population. No one knows who the first victims are or how the virus started but anyone bitten by an infected individual dies then is born again as a mindless ghoul. A group of five surviving humans - nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames) ordinary guy Michael (Jake Weber) and expecting parents Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and Luda (Inna Korobkina) - seek refuge in a local mall. There they encounter a pugnacious security guard CJ (Michael Kelly) and his sidekicks Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry). Later they spot a truck circling the mall parking lot and rescue the passengers including smart-ass Steve (Ty Burrell) sexpot Monica (Kim Poirier) father and daughter Frank (Matt Frewer) and Nicole (Lindy Booth) tough-as-nails Norma (Jayne Eastwood) and ever-practical Tucker (Boyd Banks). Banding together these people try to outrun and outgun their undead opponents. As in the original we never learn much about the origins of the virus. We see glimpses of TV news broadcasts providing coverage of the spreading epidemic but eventually all that remains on the air is static. The 1978 movie left open the possibility that the outbreak was confined to a geographical area. This Dawn of the Dead offers no such illusion of comfort. The view here is apocalyptic. The only way to escape the ravages of the plague is to find a place the zombies cant reach. One of the things that annoyed me about the original Dawn of the Dead - and its a seeming requirement of horror films - is the flagrant stupidity exhibited by the characters. Although the men and women of the new installment are not defined by their idiocy there are times when they show a lack of common sense. For example if you recognized that the quickest way to a horrible death and an even more horrible re-birth is to be bitten by a zombie would you (1) wear heavy clothing and/or some kind of body armor to protect your flesh or (2) venture into the midst of a swarm of undead dressed in a flimsy short-sleeve tee-shirt? The people inhabiting Dawn of the Dead choose option (2) making us wonder whether they have all undergone frontal lobotomies. With so many characters its inevitable that most of them end up as one-dimensional throw-aways whose sole purpose is to increase the body count. But there are exceptions. Ana Kenneth Michael and Andre are developed to a point where we care about them. And several touching subplots are handled with a deft hand Andres concern about his unborn fetus Frank and Nicoles sad farewell Kenneths long-distance friendship with a man on the roof of a nearby gun shop and Ana and Michaels halting attempts at intimacy. Of course not many people go to a horror film looking for character development and drama so there are plenty of good scares and a moment or two of gut-wrenching terror. The movie even crosses the PC line and allows children to do demonic things. The creatures in this film move a lot more quickly than those in the original whose slow staggering gait was ripe for parody. Here their swiftness proves to be the undoing of more than one character. As zombie films go this one is a small step beneath Danny Boyles 28 Days Later which was darker and creepier but its still a respectable effort. Adherents of the original may be annoyed by some of the changes but cameos by Tom Savini Scott Reiniger and Ken Foree (who once again makes the dire pronouncement ""When theres no more room in hell the dead will walk the earth"") should build some goodwill. For those who enjoy tight tense graphic horror this movie offers an ample helping.

"Dead and Loving It washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Dead and Loving It Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 19 2004 NASTY -- now theres a good word. During a screening of ""Dawn of the Dead"" the other night I heard someone in the audience shout out that word drawing out the first syllable and savoring the sibilance of the ""s"" in a way that told me it wasnt meant as a criticism. I dont mean it that way either when I say to you that the movie -- the story of a small band of suburbanites holed up in a shopping mall and their efforts to fight off a horde of flesh-eating zombies -- is one of the nastiest exercises in cinematic storytelling I have ever had the pleasure to sit through. It is in other words a paradigm of its genre bloody (and bloody scary) stylish smart audacious and edgy darkly pessimistic yet inflected with touches of deliciously sick humor. Yes its essentially a remake of a sequel albeit a sequel that happens to be one of the greatest horror movies ever made but it more than surpasses the original. Its sole aim and one at which it succeeds admirably is to simultaneously revolt scare and delight you; to make you as afraid to look at the screen as to look away from it; to fill you with such a mix of terror and guilty pleasure that you cant tell the two emotions apart. Not everyone can handle this reaction. If youre one of the people who cant -- and you know who you are -- stay well away from this bloodbath. But you already knew that didnt you? If on the other hand you saw the 1978 original and you said to yourself ""This isnt violent or funny enough"" then this is the movie for you. Not only does the new ""Dawn"" easily outstrip the gore quotient of the first film whose stage blood has been described by F/X wizard Tom Savini as looking like ""melted crayons"" but its also at times darn near hilarious. Set in a middle-American Anytown ""Dawn"" wastes no time cutting to the chase literally. Were only minutes into the film when our heroine nurse Ana (the wonderful Sarah Polley who classes up every joint she walks into) awakens to find her neighbors and soon her husband overtaken by what appears to be a rapidly spreading disease -- and it aint the flu. Communicated through bites the disease first kills it victims then unkills them turning them into cannibalistic walking corpses. Very simple. A fleeing Ana soon finds herself in the company of a ragtag handful of survivors (tough cop Ving Rhames; doting dad-to-be Mekhi Phifer and his very pregnant wife Inna Korobkina; thinking womans stud Jake Weber and others) who hole up quite naturally in the mall. At least there theyll find food water mattresses restrooms and lattes. That and a whole host of entertaining personality conflicts between security guards with hair-trigger tempers selfless martyrs and those guided by cynical self-interest. This is of course the stuff of countless ""survivor"" flicks (not to mention TVs ""Survivor""). But such conflicts are not pardon the expression the meat of this movie. That would be the zombies. They are who weve come for to see what they do and what gets done to them -- as when a surviving sharpshooter picks them off one by one from a roof choosing his victims based on their resemblance to such celebrities as Jay Leno and Burt Reynolds. And yes despite the fact that they are technically ""dead"" they can be permanently killed if shot in the head. It also helps to burn them. Forget such technicalities though. As far as ""Dawn of the Dead"" is concerned its your id thats at the wheel of the bus. Let it drive down the dark byways and blind alleys of your hippocampus where screams splashes of blood and raw fear are the only things telling it which way to turn. One final note If you still need something resembling a happy ending skip the closing credits which provide a wickedly nihilistic un-Hollywood postscript to a film that is already blacker than many people can stand. DAWN OF THE DEAD (R 98 minutes) -- Contains obscenity sensuality pervasive violence and to put it mildly lots and lots of blood. Area theaters.

"Dawn of the Dead Resurrects a Classic washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Dawn of the Dead Resurrects a Classic Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 19 2004 In ""Dawn of the Dead"" a spirited remake of George A. Romeros 1978 classic the living dead are wandering the Earth again. You know the gang Theyre dead. Walk funny. Crave human flesh. Never say ""Excuse me"" when they bump into one another -- which they do again and again. Where do they go to satisfy their cravings? Why the mall of course. Consumerism it seems is something you just never outlive. Our movie takes us to a Milwaukee suburb where clusters of zombies are gathered outside the Crossroads Mall. The reason fresh food inside. Fewer than a dozen survivors have barricaded themselves in desperately trying not to be part of the food court menu. The non-undead inside include Ana (Sarah Polley) a young nurse who has already lost her husband to the zombies; Kenneth (Ving Rhames) a cop whos not afraid to blow a hole through anyone with blood on his chops; electronics salesman Michael (Jake Weber) who looks like the Roddy McDowall of the group; and Andre (Mekhi Phifer) a dutiful husband taking care of his pregnant Russian wife Luda (Inna Korobkina). The zombies are restless. Theyre bashing on the security doors. Ana Kenneth and company realize that their best hope is to retrofit two mall shuttle buses with armor plating bust through the stiffs and twitchers and head for the coast where fellow refugee Steve (Ty Burrell) claims to have a boat. TV reports show that the zombies are all over the country thanks to a lethal plague. There is no haven anywhere. But maybe the mall rats figure they can find refuge somewhere out in the blue beyond. The movie faintly echoes the plot of Romeros film in which a small group of survivors of a similar zombie plague commandeer a helicopter and retreat to the fortlike protection of a suburban Pittsburgh mall. (It was Romeros tongue-in-cheek sequel to his darker black-and-white 1968 classic ""Night of the Living Dead"" and it made an extremely respectable 20 million.) The latest movie from Universal Pictures is clearly trying to evoke the gritty spirit of the original ""Dawn."" (Look for Ken Foree from the 1978 cast as a televangelist who declares ""When there is no more room in Hell the dead will walk the Earth."" And that county sheriff is Tom Savini makeup artist for the original ""Dawn of the Dead."") At times the new ""Dawn"" looks and feels like what it is a studio picture adopting a twisted campy spirit with the same earnest attention a corporation might give a new brand of cola. But for the most part the movie has many of the elements that made the first ""Dawn"" so darkly entertaining. The opening sequence in which nurse Ana realizes her neighborhood has turned zombie is memorably scary. And there is nothing like watching characters shoot fist-size holes through zombie brains to get an audiences juices flowing. Although first-time director Zack Snyder apes the agitated grainy-video spirit of Danny Boyles post-apocalyptic thriller of last year ""28 Days Later"" a little too closely he does have an appropriately macabre sense of humor. At one point the survivors play a rooftop sniper game in which they plug zombies who resemble celebrities including Burt Reynolds and Rosie ODonnell. The mall sound system pipes in instrumental versions of such insipid radio hits as ""Dont Worry Be Happy"" and ""All by Myself."" And this may be the only flick in movie history in which audiences applaud the point-blank execution of a snarling human infant. Hey the kids a flesh-eater okay? In this crazy world the rules are -- you know -- a little different. Dawn of the Dead (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong and pervasive horror violence and gore language and sexuality.

Romeros influential 1978 gorefest. Like last falls ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" clone ""Dawn"" is pitched at twentysomethings more likely to recognize the title than to have seen the original pic. ""Dawns"" undead will roam healthily about multiplexes and ancillary streams for some time to come. Hell overflows -- again -- in ""Dawn of the Dead"" a big-budget redo of George A. Romeros influential 1978 gorefest. Like last falls atrocious ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" clone ""Dawn"" is pitched at twentysomethings more likely to recognize the title than to have seen the original pic. More palatable than ""Texas"" ""Dawn"" also seems even less necessary given how effectively the original was reworked last year in Danny Boyles ""28 Days Later."" Target auds will be little bothered by this however allowing ""Dawns"" undead to roam healthily about multiplexes and ancillary streams for some time to come. One of the best films (horror or otherwise) of the 70s ""Dawn of the Dead"" was the middle pic in Romeros famed independently-produced zombie trilogy that began with 1968s seminal ""Night of the Living Dead"" and concluded with 1985s ""Day of the Dead."" Set in the throes of a mysterious outbreak that turned human corpses into flesh-eating drones the original ""Dawn"" told of an unlikely band of survivors -- two police officers and a married couple -- who eventually holed up together in a suburban Pennsylvania shopping mall. At which point the film became ingenious social satire touching on racism classism feminism and above all consumerism as the vicious zombies clawed their way into the mall that as one character famously observed ""was an important place in their lives."" Beginning with a jolting 10-minute sequence (which in an unprecedented marketing move was broadcast in its entirety on basic cable four nights prior to pics theatrical release) this new ""Dawn"" directed by commercials and music-video helmer Zack Snyder and scripted by James Gunn is designed to spin a new tale involving new characters while staying true to the basic outline of the original. Milwaukee hospital nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) drives home from work settles into bed with her husband then wakes the next morning to discover that her young daughter has turned into a zombie. In short order the daughter chows down on dad transforming him into a zombie too while Ana flees but finds the entire neighborhood has turned into a zombies-vs.-humans warzone. And these are not to put it mildly your fathers zombies. Unlike Romeros comically staggering sleepwalkers Snyders brood can run -- very fast -- and they make loud shrieking noises when they attack. After crashing her car Ana joins forces with police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and soon thereafter a ragtag bunch composed of Andre (Mekhi Phifer) his pregnant wife (Inna Korobkina) and the thrice-divorced Michael (Jake Weber). Together they make their way to a nearby mall where they are confronted by an antagonistic trio of security guards. The expected bickering over whos in charge and whats the best plan of action ensues. Then a truck shows up containing another eight survivors. Thats more than four times as many characters as Romero had and the decision to cast their net so inexplicably wide is the first of Snyders and Gunns ill-advised acts of revision. Whereas the resonance of Romeros film (and of ""28 Days Later"") derived from its ability to involve auds emotionally with a few spartan protagonists here viewers dont spend enough time with any of the characters to feel such a connection. The humans in the film remain as abstract as their zombie counterparts more like the characters in a video game than real people. Likewise despite having a great setting in production designer Andrew Neskoromnys virtually built-from-scratch mall the filmmakers never bring meaning to the mall location the way Romero did. In the original ""Dawn"" the human survivors as well as the undead took strange comfort in the mall culture. In this remake with the exception of one brief montage sequence that tries to make a similar point the characters might just as soon find themselves in an abandoned warehouse or church. Not surprisingly pic works only on the level of a visceral horror exercise and even then only intermittently. While Snyder stages a few audience-rousing set pieces and peppers the film with amusing shots of zombie hordes running through the streets in fast motion (like the crazed Beatles fans of ""A Hard Days Night"") his obvious scare tactics ultimately owe less to Romeros stark comic minimalism than to the countless quickie knock-offs (like Lucio Fulcis ""Zombi 2"") that followed the first ""Dawns"" success. By the finale so many things have gone bang and boom in elaborate CGI explosions that the film has a numbing effect. And pics gore quotient (courtesy of makeup whiz David Leroy Anderson) while high is considerably toned down from the infamous heights scaled by Romeros unrated epic. Lensed in heavily stylized widescreen (moody underlit interiors; grainy bleached-out exteriors) by Matthew F. Leonetti pic sports a look thats 180 degrees away from Romeros bright flat deep space compositions. However a la the recent ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" three original ""Dawn"" cast members make cameo appearances Tom Savini as a sheriff; Scott Reiniger as a general; and the steely Ken Foree as a televangeslist reiterating his signature line ""When theres no more room in hell the dead will walk the Earth.""

(AP Photo/Michael ... more Photo MICHAEL GIBSON The zombies are back and still hungry and a mall full of Muzak is the only refuge 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dawn of the Dead Horror. Starring Sarah Polley Ving Rhames and Jake Weber. Directed by Zack Snyder. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Great horror movies are vehicles for a cultures mass nightmares bringing an uneasy sense of recognition that inspires hysteria and laughter. ""Dawn of the Dead"" has a juicy metaphor at its center one thats neither complicated nor subtle but alive in the weird childlike and obvious way of the unconscious. With its ravenous undead zombies on a rampage and the few remaining humans hiding out in an abandoned shopping mall its a movie that makes an implicit commentary on the nature of consumer culture. But unlike the 1978 ""Dawn of the Dead"" this remake of the George A. Romero film keeps that metaphor implicit and its social satire under wraps. You can make a social satire only if the audience is interested in society. Instead the new ""Dawn of the Dead"" satirizes itself and satirizes its genre and on its own unambitious terms the movie succeeds. Its silly witty and good-natured not scary so much as icky and not horrifying or horrible but consistently amusing. Yet such is the skill at work here -- just imagine the challenge of making 105 minutes of zombie killing interesting -- that one cant help wish director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn had gone for something more evocative and unsettling. The undead after all are like mindless consumers run amok always eating and never full suffering from the spiritual disease of eternal famine. When the still-healthy humans flee to the shopping mall for safety one might expect the mall to be presented with some irony. Instead its presented unambiguously as a sanctuary. Fine. This is 2004 not 1978 and we have bigger things to worry about. Though its wrong to read the Sept. 11 2001 attacks into everything the stylish pre-credits sequence in which actress Sarah Polley frantically drives through destroyed neighborhoods cant help but evoke our worst nightmares. In 2004 its just impossible to do a long shot of a city in ruins without knowing that youre recalling images of lower Manhattan in the fall of 2001. If theres one fear thats real in ""Dawn of the Dead"" one terror thats presented without smirking irony its the terror of civil chaos -- of waking up to the clock-radio one morning and finding out that its all gone to hell. Polley plays Ana a young nurse who hooks up with Ving Rhames a police sergeant with lots of guns. The two join a small group -- an even-tempered man named Michael (Jake Weber) and a married couple (Mekhi Phifer and Inna Korobkina) -- and off they go to the mall for refuge. There they meet three really stupid security guards among them CJ (Michael Kelly) the leader who is more concerned about the possibility of the malls getting looted than about the possible end of human life on this planet. Thats the basic lineup and the rest of the movie is all the stuff that happens The random zombie. The gradual multiplication of zombies hovering around all sides of the mall. The bonding the tension the adjustment to life without hope. In one scene as the characters look on all sides for ravenous maniacs the malls sound system plays a Muzak version of ""Dont Worry Be Happy."" In another high-tension grotesque moment the Muzak is playing ""You Light Up My Life."" ""Dawn of the Dead"" goes a long way on such moments of macabre wit and Gunns screenplay working within the limits of the workaday horror genre finds ways to delineate character and provide colorful clashes between the various personalities. Polley usually ethereal in a matter-of-fact way gets the chance to become an action heroine a thinking persons Linda Hamilton. Shes fun -- theyre all fun -- especially Rhames and Kelly. Special mention should also be made of Ty Burrell as Steve a snotty rich guy who gets the films best lines. Asked if the people in a certain section of town are all dead he answers ""Dead-ish."" -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations strong language and nonstop violence.

Romeros two-hour-plus 1979 original about a mall and flesh-eating zombies. Can anything save a new retread from ""walking dead"" status? Universal Studios Violent even for the genre the 79 version was a much-debated follow-up to 1968s superior Night of the Living Dead whose black-and-white photography was far more otherworldly than subsequent color versions. So after 1985s worn-out Dayof the Dead and 1990s blah Night remake can anything save a new retread from ""walking dead"" status? Well at least Snyder has cast two performers of surprising note. Sarah Polley plays a Wisconsin nurse who by showering with hubby misses the broadcast warning that trouble has brewed. The foreplay is cut short when the husband is dispatched before the opening credits roll. That introduces a small survivor group ripe to warble Nobody Knows the Trouble Ive Seen. It includes a police officer played by Ving Rhames who periodically indulges the patented Rhames glare at sass-back members of the cast. ABOUT THE MOVIE Dawn of the Dead   1/2 (out of four) Stars Sarah Polley Ving Rhames Mekhi Phifer Michael Kelly Jake Weber Director Zack Snyder Distributor Universal Rating Zack Snyder Opens Friday nationwide Soon theyre all in the mall with marauding zombies and director Snyder tries to be resourceful with his been-there/done-that premise. He comes up with a rooftop chess game thats original and he has brief fun in the malls TV department when a self-camcording couple has sex on a big screen. Multiple screens carry local newscasts of zombies twitching and being shot point-blank in the head. Snyder comes up with some ""wow"" shots Polley emerging from her suburban home into multiple fires sirens and zombies and later a spectacular overhead view of zombies surrounding a van of escapees that makes you empathize with Custer at Little Big Horn. But he wounds a movie thats just a bit better than tolerable with an end-credits coda that pays cheap ineffectual homage to another horror film this one of the modern era. Bad move. Yet overall this Dead is zippier than 1995s retake on Village of the Damned and somewhat less junky than the recent remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You do have to wonder though whether Rhames ponders ""Did I go to the Juilliard School of Drama for this?""
