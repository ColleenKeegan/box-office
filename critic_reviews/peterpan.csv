ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. ; on 8/8/03 in . / Universal ... more Younger cast makes Peter Pan as fantastic as Neverland 1 / 2 Back to Gallery MPeter Pan. Fantasy. Starring Jeremy Sumpter Rachel Hurd-Wood Jason Isaacs. Directed by P.J. Hogan. (PG. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). ""Peter Pan"" a dazzling retelling of the J.M. Barrie tale offers accomplished acting splendid visuals and in the role of the boy who wont grow up ... an actual boy. The casting of 14-year-old-Jeremy Sumpter instead of the pixieish women and grown men who usually play Pan lends the story a new poignancy -- it turns out there are drawbacks to never growing up like the prospect of having to part with the lovely storyteller Wendy. Sumpter captures the classic Pan mix of sweetness and stubbornness but also something else -- a cockiness appropriate for a kid who goes toe to toe with Capt. Hook. The new ""Pan"" directed and co-written for the screen by P.J. Hogan (""Muriels Wedding"") opens in an idealized Edwardian London where the art of storytelling still holds children rapt -- a nice image in this era of video- game instant gratification. Wendy played with intelligence and intense curiosity by 13-year-old Rachel Hurd-Wood is so good at spinning tales that she draws Pan all the way from Neverland (no smirks about Michael Jackson please -- its crucial to believe). When Peter tells Wendy about the Lost Boys back home she flies away with him as any sensible dreamer would. The flight to Neverland unleashes the visual wonders of Donald McAlpines (""Moulin Rouge"") vibrant cinematography and some stunning digital effects. Vivid pink and red sunsets give way to planets resembling giant jawbreakers and finally to the magical forests of Pans home. The storybook production design fits the enchantment of the tale and the technical details are mastered as well. Even the flying looks real. The Wendy-Pan friendship faces some immediate obstacles not the least of which is a tiny ball of jealousy named Tinker Bell. Ludivine Sagnier the young seductress from ""Swimming Pool"" is wordless but lively as Tink looking ready to burst at the sight of a rival for Pans affections. Far nastier is the hook-handed pirate determined to best his young rival. Jason Isaacs makes his Hook a diabolical dandy yet he never hams it up. His villain is charming and crafty -- or at least charming and crafty enough to fool a young girl. A sequence where Hook kidnaps Wendy brims with merriment and danger. Excited at the prospect of becoming a pirate the girl talks details with the boss ""I could not be expected to pillage."" Director Hogans affinity for young actors shows in natural assured performances down to the last Lost Boy. Harry Newell and Freddie Popplewell are particularly good as Wendys tag-along brothers bookish lads delighted and terrified to be thrust into a real adventure. Some of the films images are truly eerie even for adults like the reptilian mermaids trying to pull Peter and Wendy into a murky lake. Creepier still is Hooks homicidal obsession with Pan. Seeing a grown man go after a boy is unsettling even if we know the clever boy has the advantage. This Peter and Wendy actually have some chemistry -- a new development for a ""Peter Pan"" movie. It can be a little weird especially in shots where Sumpter and Hurd-Wood look like the kids from ""The Blue Lagoon"" but it also raises the stakes for Pan and highlights the bittersweet nature of the story. Young Peter is still as innocent and headstrong as ever but this time he really knows what hes missing. -- Advisory This film contains violence frightening images.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Remake doesnt quite Pan outBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Put in for flight pay Theres a new Peter Pan ( 1/2 out of four). Tepid but inoffensive its a needless alternative to the rowdy Disney animated version the Mary Martin TV version beloved by boomers and the fabulous silent version with Betty Bronson now on DVD. Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and Tinker Bell (Ludivine Sagnier) arrive at the Darling nursery window. AP Photo/ILM/Universal Studios Industry credo Never say never to Never-Never Land. Familiarity doesnt exactly breed contempt yet despite the novelty of a real boy as Peter the movie does engender a listless been-there/eaten-that reaction. Or at least it may from the point of view of a hungry crocodile that looks more computer-generated than other more successful effects including some super-cool clouds that look like pink cotton candy. So with a just-as-cool Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) director P.J. Hogans functional retread is acceptable enough to mute memories of Steven Spielbergs 1991 career nadir Hook whose high-fiving Lost Boys still make it akin to walking the plank with the croc and Jaws below. Brainy a budding beauty and a master story-spinner to non-descript bands of Boys and pirate personnel this Wendy is a delicately bookish type wholl someday spend her honeymoon reading The Pickwick Papers. Yet she seems like such a catch that its harder than ever to see why the movies surfer-like Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) would rather spend his time with scruffy Lost Boys who could all use a Boraxo facial. By virtue of his crucial meanie roles in The Patriot and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Jason Isaacs comes naturally if not too excitingly to his role as Captain Hook. But fans may do a double take early on when they also see Isaacs playing the father of Wendy and her brothers. And in what would seem to be a dream role for Paris Hilton ""Tink"" is played by Swimming Pools suitless wonder Ludivine Sagnier one of the most eclectic one-two punches any young actress has pulled off in the same year. Marginally more attired here Sagnier has the kinetic body language of a 20s flapper and shes a pretty convincing flapper herself in the fluttering-wings department. Peter is as adequate as the Harry Potter movies are thoughyou never sense in either case that kids are being bitten with the permanent movie-loving bug. Then again quality can be relative. It was only last Christmas that we got Roberto Begnini as Pinocchio with a Geppetto who looked like Dr. Phil. (Opens Thursday nationally. PG for adventure action sequences and peril.)

Barries 99-year-old tale. Well cast elaborate production lacks the excitement and magic that would elevate the film to beloved status. Kids worldwide should rep an enthusiastic audience spelling a healthy B.O. future. The audacity of a flying Captain Hook aside this first live-action ""Peter Pan"" of the sound film era is a sober straightforward and quite faithful adaptation of Scottish author J.M. Barries 99-year-old tale about the adventure-loving boy who wont grow up. Handsome respectable and well cast elaborate production lacks the excitement and magic that would elevate the film to beloved status and sheer abundance of CGI work weighs on it too heavily. But kids worldwide most of whom will be exposed to the story for the first time should rep an enthusiastic audience for the high-flying derring-do and pirate deviltry spelling a healthy if not soaring B.O. future. Co-producer Lucy Fisher two decades ago acquired the rights to the Barrie ""Pan"" properties which include not only the 1904 play but the eventual novel ""Peter and Wendy"" published seven years later. The past 20 years have served up the dreadful but successful ""Hook"" as well as years of touring legit productions of the delightful musical starring Cathy Rigby and others who have kept the franchise name alive for fresh generations. Many baby boomer parents have no doubt shown their kids the breezy 1953 Disney animated feature not to mention videos of that generations most cherished version the TV special of the musical starring Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard. For completists the 1924 silent film of the story still exists as well. To his credit and with a measure of seriousness not present in his popular comedies ""Muriels Wedding"" and ""My Best Friends Wedding"" director-co-writer P.J. Hogan working from a script first penned by Michael Goldenberg (""Contact"") has leaned more toward fidelity to his literary sources than to pandering to the presumed dumbed-down tastes of the contempo kiddy audience. A literary quality informs the narration and flow of events that may create a restlessness in the troops from time to time although spectacular action and effects come to the rescue with such regularity that the sweep of the story will pull along most viewers young and old. For grown-ups there is also the fresh spectacle of witnessing Peter Pan played by a boy. Although the film walks a very fine line with it an undeniable cusp-of-adolescence romantic/sexual subcurrent courses through the Peter-Wendy relationship. Given the characters ages and extreme attractiveness this is quite plausible but it is also vaguely unsettling given its complete absence from previous versions and undeniably brings a new component to the debate over whether or not to remain a child. In the warmly inviting nursery of the Darling family townhouse in Edwardian Bloomsbury 12-year-old Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) regales her younger brothers John (Harry Newell) and Michael (Freddie Popplewell) with tales of Peter Pan and the pirates while the real boy lurks about outside the window. Recovering his errant shadow Peter (Jeremy Sumpter) in short order convinces Wendy to fly off with him to Neverland for endless adventure and freedom from responsibilities a decision she makes just after her parents (Jason Isaacs and Olivia Williams) and spinster Aunt Millicent (a freshly coined character vigorously played by Lynn Redgrave) inform her that its time she grew up. After quickly teaching the three Darling sprigs to fly courtesy of fairy dust from the endlessly prankish Tink (Ludivine Sagnier this years French bombshell from ""Swimming Pool"") Peter leads the kids on an outer space spin through a dizzyingly brilliant solar system seemingly composed of dozens of planets. Still its hard not to recall Mary Martins ""Im Flying"" during this sequence. In Neverland the pirates are waiting for spring while idling on board a massive ship encrusted by snow and ice. In his first scene Hook (Isaacs perfectly cast and following tradition by doubling as Mr. Darling) shows something of himself never before seen his right hand stub hookless before being harnessed. A briefly etched comic highlight is an animatronic peg-legged parrot belonging to Hooks loyal friend Smee (a winning Richard Briers) while some eerie-looking web-handed Asiatic-looking mermaids are so effective that more with them would have been welcome. As the film proceeds through the familiar plot highlights -- the Tink-inspired shooting of the Wendy Bird by the Lost Boys the pirates capture of Wendy and her brothers Tinks sacrifice of drinking poison meant for Peter and her resurrection via the communal chanting of ""I do believe in fairies"" all leading up to the climactic shipboard battle between the pirates and Peters boys -- the sense of earnest dedication inspires respect and even a reasonable amount of engagement. Unfortunately these responses are not surpassed by an infusion of glee and uninhibited fun that would imbue the film with a personality of its own strong enough o stir audiences to advanced levels of escapism which is what ""Peter Pan"" is meant to do. Whatever else one can say about ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" it did possess a certain goofy charm and irreverence when it came to genre conventions even if the picture remains unthinkable without Johnny Depp. This ""Peter Pan"" is distinct from any rendition of the story that could have been attempted previously due to the sophistication of the visual effects a fact that cuts both ways. Since anything is now possible Hogan can and does indulge in (literal) flights of fancy that produce the speed and flash to keep kids bug-eyed. Hes also able to combine scenic backgrounds to unusual effect Influenced by the vibrantly colored paintings of the Romantic period pic features verdant landscapes and canopies of bright hues to envelope the action in a resplendent lushness that extends from the womb of affluent London to the hidden enclaves of Neverland. All the same the combination of design effects and backdrops that flaunt their drawn quality isnt always seamless and the special effects eventually call too much attention to themselves. Some of the flying has a forced too-fast quality that recalls some of the jerky bouncing about in ""Spider-man"" and lacks the grace and wonder of traditional wire work. And when Hook having managed to get sprinkled with some fairy dust himself goes aloft for the grand finale duel with Peter traditionalists will just check out; giving Hook anti-gravity powers removes his opponents key advantage over him. Decision comes off simply like a grandstanding move to give the audience something its not expecting. Touched up with blond highlights and graced with a useful animal look in his face Sumpter who was very good in ""Frailty"" is a bit in and out as Peter Pan. He looks just right and handles the action well but there are moments when he seems not entirely there. He also falls a bit short in conveying the rambunctious inspirational qualities one expects from the fearless leader of the Lost Boys. All the same this is supposed to be a Peter afflicted with at least a hint of doubt about his chosen role in life an embryonically psychological Pan who at some point may find that life and love have passed him by. The voluptuously visaged Hurd-Wood who was discovered in a London open casting call is a splendid Wendy a girl more mature than the other sprigs who copes intelligently with the numerous crises and choices confronting her. Resisting any temptation to camp Isaacs smartly and effectively plays Hook for real menace his threat compounded by the chilling assortment of alternate hooks he can screw onto his stub. By contrast his Mr. Darling is the wimpiest fellow in London scarcely able to complete sentence so one wonders what a beauty like Mrs. Darling gracefully played by Olivia Williams is doing with him. Uttering squeaky gibberish Sagnier mugs prances and contorts herself as Tink in a manner thats both cute and annoying; although her face is always her own character seems otherwise animated at many moments. Shot almost entirely in the Warner Roadshow Studios in Gold Coast Queensland Australia production looks sumptuous thanks especially to Roger Fords judiciously extravagant production design Donald M. McAlpines lustrous lensing and Janet Pattersons imaginative but not overdone costumes. James Newton Howards almost continuous score is properly supportive rather than overbearing.
