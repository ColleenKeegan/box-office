Not in our lifetime is Johnny Knoxville and cos implicit retort by way of this sporadically hilarious assortment of weapons-grade idiocy in which a group of fully grown narcissists risk life and limb in a series of ever more inventive ways. From the simple joy of a spring-loaded boxing glove to the face to the sight of trained simpleton Steve-O jamming a fishhook through his cheek and diving into shark infested waters theres definitely three bad stunts for every good one. The group seem to foster a schoolboy obsession for baiting wild animals and following the sudden death of professional croc-botherer Steve Irwin Knoxvilles narrow escape from being gored by a dangerously irate bull seems scarily if almost offensively prescient.

This stunningly shameless follow-up to the sleeper offers more of the same while repeatedly upping the ante in terms of offensiveness. The first feature spun from MTVs notorious ""Jackass"" was described in these pages as ""quite possibly the most exuberantly distasteful hodgepodge of beery anarchy and death-wishing irresponsibility ever unleashed by a major Hollywood distrib."" But when it comes to plumbing new depths of ingeniously egregious gross-out humor ""jackass the movie"" was an under-achiever compared to its inevitable sequel the ever-so-aptly titled ""jackass number two."" This stunningly shameless follow-up to the 2002 theatrical sleeper (and homevid mega-seller) offers more of the same -- a lot more -- while repeatedly upping the ante in terms of offensiveness. Which of course should greatly -- and profitably -- please is target aud. Much like its predecessor ""jackass number two"" has been cobbled together with brazen haphazardness. Again the filmmakers havent even bothered to provide capital letters or a colon for its title. Nothing more than a series of skits some of which barely qualify as blackouts pic showcases hearty-partying Johnny Knoxville and his equally uninhibited cohorts (Bam Margera Chris Pontius Steve-O Dave England Ryan Dunn Wee Man Preston Lacy Ehren McGhehey) as they do terrible things to each other and themselves while exhibiting varying degrees of sadism masochism exhibitionism and (apparently) inebriation. In a typical bit the wild boys place one of their fellows atop a familiar carnival attraction -- a mallet-driven strength tester -- and use the contraption to drive a huge dildo up the guys anus. (Homoeroticism isnt so much a subtext as a running gag through the entire pic.) Later the happy-go-lucky Steve-O places a large fishing hook through his cheek then allows himself to be used as human bait in shark-infested waters. Projectile vomiting figures prominently during other episodes and the camera never turns away not even when one Jackass washes down some horse manure with a gulp of beer. Indeed it remains firmly affixed on the effluence as auds are left to ponder various meanings of the term ""gag."" And speaking of horses more barfing ensues after a lusty stallion is rudely interrupted during a mating attempt. Repeatedly the ""Jackass"" boys risk permanent injury -- or at the very least total humiliation -- as they collide with metal doors ski down staircases attach leeches to their eyeballs barely avoid being gored by angry bulls and allow themselves to be pelted with a explosion-propelled fusillade of hard rubber balls. (At one point a member of the gang semi-seriously wails ""Please God dont let there be a Jackass 3."") And when they run out of things to do to themselves they bring in guest stars like filmmakers John Waters and Spike Jonze to ratchet up the brutal tomfoolery. If youre in a suitably debauched frame of mind -- and perhaps more important if you refrain from dining for several hours beforehand -- ""jackass number two"" could very well make you laugh until youre thoroughly ashamed of yourself. Or not. Much like some of the delicacies savored on screen pic is very much an acquired taste. To call the humor sophomoric would be to overstate its sophistication. Call it infantile and youll be much closer to the mark. But its hard to deny that many of the more outrageous bits have an exhilaratingly potent shock-you-into-guffawing impact. And while a few stretches do feel wearyingly repetitious you never have to wait too long before another eruption of ""I cant believe they did that"" lunacy. Put it another way If you enjoyed ""jackass the movie"" -- and you know who you are -- ""jackass number two"" will qualify as another guilty pleasure you wont want to discuss in polite company. Its worth noting by the way that while much of the first ""jackass"" pic was shot in messy muddy digital video the sequel boasts production values that border on adequacy. jackass number twoProductionA Paramount release of a Paramount Pictures and MTV Films presentation of a Dickhouse production in association with Lynch Siderow Prods.

But sometimes life as a movie critic requires an otherwise reasonable person to totter over to a multiplex and take careful notes while watching a group of oddly grinning men get branded on the buttocks or pour beer into bodily orifices not usually used for such purpose or drink things that were not meant to be drunk. One of the more positive things I can say about ""JNT"" is that it serves the function of a crash diet After seeing it you will not want to eat again for a very very long time. Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Jackass Number Two"" with Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Steve-O Chris Pontius Ryan Dunn Wee Man Preston Lacy Dave England Ehren McGhehey. Directed by Jeff Tremaine. 95 minutes. Rated R for dangerous sometimes extremely crude stunts; language; and nudity. Several theaters. Essentially ""JNT"" (and the previous movie and TV show) is a series of stunts most of which are extremely dangerous stomach-churningly disgusting or both. The more-or-less interchangeable guys appear as themselves agreeable doofuses ready for anything. (Why do they risk life limb and stomach on a regular basis? Is this just what guys who dont have girlfriends do in their spare time? Note to self Stop asking questions. Just move on. And dont think about eating or about that scene involving the horse.) OK to get to the point Is it funny? Sure at times -- bits like the animal-costumed roller-skating crashes or when a guy in a devil costume is spewed forth onto a sidewalk with a sign reading ""Keep God Out of California"" are funnier than much of what passes for comedy these days. And its closing song-and-dance number which borrows a song from ""La Cage aux Folles"" (huh?) is weirdly endearing. But mostly its just incredibly stupid -- which is of course the point. ""Jackass"" celebrates stupidity in its tasteless jovial way. In one scene one guy shows his newly branded behind to his horrified mother (one of the very few women shown on screen -- this is for better or worse an entirely male universe) while another random Jackass apologies for not holding the burning rod steady. ""But why would you burn him in the first place?"" asks Mom who apparently didnt get the memo. ""Because its funny?"" offers somebody. Watch ""Jackass Number Two"" at your own risk. One persons funny is another persons ... well maybe you dont want to know.

With Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Steve-O and Chris Pontius. Directed by Jeff Tremaine. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The second ""Jackass"" movie begins and ends with a warning so this review will do the same This film contains stunts that are so tasteless that we cant even explain them in the advisory because The Chronicle is a family newspaper. It seems as if every scene in the movie ends with someone vomiting. Full frontal nudity is the rule not the exception. And one scene features nothing more than a guy defecating onto a dollhouse toilet. All that being said -- and the warning continues below -- ""Jackass Number 2"" is extremely funny. I dont recall being in physical pain from laughing (which happened a couple of times during the first film) but the sequel still delivers what it promises. This is the ""Godfather II"" of tasteless prank films. ""Jackass Number 2"" is less a movie than the process of natural selection at work. Its filled with stupid people doing stupid things that could easily get them maimed or killed. Later some of the stupid people watching the movie will ignore the warnings and try the stunts at home and one or two of them will get maimed or killed. As a rule you need below a 95 IQ to really enjoy this film. (I suspect mine is in the 70s because I was laughing louder than most during the advance screening.) But low-brow audiences deserve to be entertained too and the concept and execution of ""Jackass"" is much more ingenious that the television series and movies have received credit for. Johnny Knoxville is the ringleader of a group with the same size and social structure of the typical ""Saturday Night Live"" cast. The group travels around the world often with the help of a celebrity -- everyone from John Waters to Tony Hawk. They play pranks on each other (frequently with a double cross) run dangerous and often ironic experiments (such as using a willing human as bait for hammerhead sharks) or just spend time being as gross as possible. (Did we mention what they did to the dollhouse?) Most of the scenes are shot with handheld cameras oftentimes hidden. The funniest part usually isnt the stunt itself but the reaction of the other Jackasses innocent passers-by or a friend or relative of the victim. ""Why would you burn him in the first place Ryan?"" asks Bam Margeras mother after she learns that cast member Ryan Dunn has used a cattle brand to stamp several penis shapes on her sons buttocks. ""Because it was funny?"" Dunn responds. The second ""Jackass"" movies biggest shortcoming is a lack of unforgettable scenes that youll be talking about the next day. The first movie had five or six (including the demolition derby rental car and the Hot Wheels enema) and the sequel has two or three. The middle part of the film in particular slows down quite a bit although the next-to-last skit -- involving a guy dressed up as a terrorist who gets double-crossed a few different ways -- is pretty amazing. Or its really horrible depending on your feelings about this kind of humor. The cast of ""Jackass Number 2"" is likely to end up dead paralyzed or at the very least addicted to Percocet. But as long as they still have the strength and cluelessness to strap themselves to giant homemade rockets let the good times roll. -- Advisory Where did we leave off? This film contains profanity violence and dangerous stunts that should not be attempted at home. Bathroom humor is rampant. And its hard to believe that no animals were injured during the making of this movie. (At the very least a garter snake was sexually assaulted.)

"Jackass Number Two is crude dangerous and really really funny - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Jackass is so funny it hurts By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 22 2006 Any episode of ""Jackass"" or its two movies the second of which opens today kicks off with a disclaimer. Dont try this at home it pleads. Thats always sobering advice though Im fairly certain that an evening of sticking my hand in a bear trap is not in the cards. Neither is an afternoon spent impaling my cheek with a fishhook then leaping into the Gulf of Mexico tethered to a fishing pole to pose as shark bait. Nor should they be for you.Watching a bunch of dudes in a movie do it is an entirely different story. ""Jackass Number Two"" is another scrapbook of bad ideas made excruciatingly and uproariously real. Those who seek to imitate such activities are like the movies merry gang of lunatics crazy.Filmed in appropriately crude digital video ``Jackass Number Two"" arrives only weeks after Steve Irwins ugly demise at the point of a stingray and the sight of these guys doing a stunt called Anaconda Ball Pit (two snakes a tank of plastic fun balls and three Jackassers) leaves you fearful for their lives. No one in the ""Jackass"" franchise appears to proceed with caution which of course is the fascinating point of these adventures.Officially Johnny Knoxville Bam Margera Steve-O Chris Pontius and the rest of the ""Jackass"" crew are not scientists. But their comedy qualifies as research and their research consequently deserves to be considered comedy. The subject is the human body and their experiments challenge mans capacity for pain. In a sense this makes them corporeal frontiersmen. In fact the only person in the history of movies as devoted to subverting bodily norms is David Cronenberg. And not even hes come up with a character who can receive a beer enema with such glee. (Lets hear it for Steve-O.)In ``Number Two"" we see the body reach its visceral limit (expressed usually by vomiting) and we see that limits psychological manifestation fear. Margera the most amiable member of the gang runs for his life from a cobra and more than once is filmed near tears. (After Medicine Ball Dodgeball he declares ``That was fun. Lets never do that again."") Apparently Knoxville who is mauled by bulls on several occasions fears nothing. As the leader of this outfit hes like a gutter-rat George Clooney and his crew is a skate-park Oceans 12.The double feat of ``Jackass"" is that it weds the obviously juvenile with the arrestingly profound. The boys of Delta Kappa Epsilon and their TAs can watch this movie in the same theater. Many smarty-pants have noted that ``Jackass"" distills physical comedy to its essence while scrapping narrative altogether. The stunts (in ``Number Two"" Margera aptly refers to them as bits) are the joke and the body becomes the punch line. This is extreme comedy and its amazing how director Jeff Tremaine who along with Spike Jonze has been affiliated with this troupe from its outset creates an environment where self-inflicted torture is uncontrollably funny without being morally offensive.Still given the devouring of animal secretions and the abundance of buttocks and penises on display its a miracle that the MPAA let ``Number Two"" off with a mere R. ``Jackass"" has always comfortably straddled the line between the gay and the brotherly. This is a world largely absent women and its orbit gleefully revolves around the phallus. And this second movie actually suggests a kind of coming out. John Waters who is this crews transgressive uncle shows up for one gag and the final shot belongs to Rip Taylor who walks on after the films big Broadway/Hollywood-style musical number. That is correct. Theres a musical number and any frat dude in the audience will tell you Its fabulousWesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Gladly Suffering Fools washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Gladly Suffering Fools Off with a bang Human goofball Johnny Knoxville rides a rocket to stardom -- or somewhere -- in ""Jackass Number Two"" which offers plenty of belly laughs or bellyaches. (Sean Cliver -- Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 22 2006 Joseph Campbell would have loved ""Jackass Number Two."" Yes the late philosopher -- and grand guru of human mythology -- would have watched with serene appreciation as Johnny Knoxville Chris Pontius Steve-O Bam Margera and Wee Man play practical jokes on one another perform dangerous stunts and commit gross-out acts guaranteed to jolt even the unshakable out of their seats. Lowbrow entertainment hed understand may be fast food for hoi polloi -- at least by the reckoning of people who use expressions like ""hoi polloi."" But its disregard for aesthetics social redemption and serious themes makes for deeper insights into our humanity than a thousand Picassos. Watching ""Jackass"" Joseph Campbell would probably think of the Acapulco cliff divers who have plunged 130 feet into the Pacific for centuries or the young Masai warriors who mark passage into adulthood by killing a lion. He might have reflected on the time-honored rituals of youth; the need for young men (or women -- although not in this movie) to test their limits; or the human beings universal need to perform heroic or dangerous (or in the case of ""Jackass"" heedlessly stupid) feats and return triumphant and ready to rejoin society. And Id like to think hed enjoy the belly laughs this movie seeks from its audience. Sure ""Jackass Number Two"" amounts to wall-to-wall bonehead behavior. And its hard if not impossible to justify the grosser material some of which borders on the pornographic. But these arrested-development dudes are -- in their own goofy way -- living inside a cartoon in which violence is temporarily painless. ""Why wouldnt they make two of the same size wheels?"" yells Knoxville riding a penny farthing bicycle just before he crashes into a snowdrift and lands on the unforgiving concrete beyond. The cartoonish atmosphere continues with a gag in which a spring-mounted boxing glove lurks behind a sign designed to lure unsuspecting victims to read it; and some ""Jackass"" members even do the classic step-on-the-garden-rake routine so that the handle whips into their faces. All thats missing are the cartoonish sound effects those wah-wah-wahs and twittering birds. ""Why did you do it in the first place?"" asks a disbelieving April Dunne mother of ""Jackass"" player Ryan as she looks at the cattle branding her son just voluntarily sustained on his bare rump. "" Cause its funny"" says Ryan. Of course the frisson of real danger is always there. But the performers understand the simple integrity of a slapstick gag and theyre prepared to suffer for its entertainment value. This is what the Jackassers do for fun -- and their fans already well versed in such previous shows as the original MTV series and the 2002 ""Jackass The Movie"" understand that perfectly. And is there any significant moral difference between these performers and dedicated ballerinas who damage their feet in the highfalutin interests of art or Daytona drivers risking their lives on the track? Beyond the dumb-fun Zen of ""Jackass"" something even more appealing arises a certain innocence. And what innocence would that be? you might ask as Steve-O pushes a metal fishhook through his cheek so he can dangle on a fishing line in a sea of hammerheads or Chris Pontius exposes a sensitive part of his anatomy (covered like a cloth puppet to resemble a fuzzy mouse) to a very nippy snake? The clue comes just after they have completed their stunts gags or self-inflicted torture sessions. As they congregate in a celebratory ritual of relief look closely into their eyes. Youll see something extraordinarily tender a childlike glint. Its only there for an instant before they laugh it off and prepare for the next ordeal and no doubt ""Jackass 3."" Jackass Number Two (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extremely crude material dangerous stunts profanity and nudity.

Comments Jackass Number Two More stunts pranks and gross-out humor from Johnny Knoxville and company whose MTV reality show Jackass and big-screen hit Jackass The Movie have pushed the lowbrow as low as it will go. Parts of this are screamingly funny (a groupies love note posted on the wall of a hotel corridor that conceals a spring-wired boxing glove) other parts downright stomach turning (drinking a glass of horse semen on a dare) but you have to admire the fact that for these guys ""anything for a laugh"" really means anything. And for all the moronic behavior there are also some inspired dadaist moments (a staged gang war between white and black midgets that mystifies onlookers). The movie opens with a parody of the running of the bulls at Pamplona and near the end pays homage to the collapsing-house-front gag from Buster Keatons Steamboat Bill Jr.--barbed reminders that some of our hallowed cultural artifacts also traded in cheap thrills.

There I said it. Im sorry but trampolining into a ceiling fan is simply brilliant. Its performance art. But unlike most films I love Ive never been compelled to watch Jackass twice. A dude snorting wasabi will not pay dividends over and over again -- and therein lies one of its limitations as art. The shock is all. Jackass Number Two is not as original aberrantly beautiful unrepetitious or good as Jackass Number One yet it will still double a lot of people over with big laughs and grossed-out disbelief. The sequel again finds Johnny Knoxville and his cackling buddies torturing each other in tastelessly innovative ways and even if you cant stomach (or stand) what theyre up to you still have to admit that these goons execute their gags exceptionally well. Knoxville alone face-plants into asphalt gets bitten by an anaconda (twice) gets gored (more than once) by a bull drinks horse semen punches a bear trap and just hangs on for dear life as a big red rocket launches him high up over a lake. How -- especially after two movies -- is he or someone from his crew not dead eight times over? Something about these movies blows my mind and maybe its that as crude as they are they make me believe in the existence of a watchful God.
