By John Hartl Film critic msnbc.com updated 7/13/2006 24516 PM ET 2006-07-13T184516 Print Font + - REVIEW Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson the ""Wedding Crashers"" pals from last year have gone their separate ways this summer -- Vaughn to a train wreck called ""The Break-Up"" Wilson to the equally misbegotten ""You Me and Dupree."" Both movies have been sold as comedies and both play more like failed dramas. The spectacle of Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston fighting for two hours was never inherently funny. Neither is the drawn-out crackup of the threesome who drive the plot of ""Dupree."" Wilson plays Randy Dupree the slacker pal of land developer Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon) whose marriage to a sophisticated schoolteacher Molly (Kate Hudson) is threatened when Dupree moves in with them. He gave up his job to be best man at their wedding so he figures the least they can do is lend him their couch while he looks for work. Soon hes re-recording their telephone messages making their toilets overflow installing premium-channel cable so they can watch ""The Sopranos"" exposing himself (and worse) in their living room and nearly burning down the house when he lights too many candles for a tryst with a nymphomaniac librarian named Mandy. The first third of the movie plays like an overextended remake of the classic ""Saturday Night Live"" skit ""The Thing That Wouldnt Leave"" in which John Belushi played the most unwelcome guest. Act Two clumsily drops the black-humor approach and turns strangely sappy with Dupree so hung up on Mandy that he cant stop listening to Barry Manilow. In Act Three Carl becomes jealous of the cozy relationship Dupree establishes with both Molly and her otherwise hostile father (Michael Douglas) who emasculates Carl in his job and tries to wreck his marriage to Molly. The character appears to have been lifted from ""Meet the Parents"" but Douglas adds nothing to it. Little makes sense in Mike LeSieurs anything-goes script which provides few reasons for Mollys erratic behavior. At first she seems foolishly tolerant of Duprees antics then she sees him as a threat to their marriage then she turns on him. Eventually she accepts him as an inevitable part of their household. Maybe its the pyromaniac in him (or her) that turns her on. Who knows? Video Owen Wilson Hudson visibly struggles to smooth over the abrupt transitions in her character. So do Wilson who may have reached the limits of his surfer-dude charm (he also co-produced the film and worked on the script) and Dillon who works hardest to make something of his role. He plays Carl as a betrayed straight arrow who is out of his depth and he finds a legitimate poignancy in the characters more emotional scenes. Harry Dean Stanton and Lance Armstrong are almost invisible in cameo roles. The co-directors Anthony and Joe Russo previously made the 2002 flop ""Welcome to Collinwood"" though theyre better-known for their work on the prize-winning half-hour television comedy ""Arrested Development."" Gifted though they may be in smaller doses theyre a long way from mastering the art of feature-length comedy.

""You Me and Dupree"" will be released in theaters on July 14 2006. Photo Credit Melissa Moseley / Unive You Me and a joyless waste of Owen Wilson 1 / 2 Back to Gallery You Me and Dupree Comedy. Starring Owen Wilson Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson. Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To try to make any sense of ""You Me and Dupree"" is to invite a headache. The people onscreen look and sound like human beings but nothing in their behavior corresponds with recognizable or rational behavior. Its a movie about relationships in which the relationships are bogus a movie about friendship that contains no truth about friendship and -- probably no coincidence -- its a comedy without laughs and a drama without a scrap of sincere feeling. ""Dupree"" is nearly as discordant as the romantic comedies made by the Third Reich. Its just off odd and joyless. Usually its possible with any movie with any artwork for that matter to discern intent to understand what someone was trying to say or accomplish in creating it but the intent remains elusive this time. Instead an eerie feeling descends after youve talked about ""Dupree"" for 10 minutes the suspicion that just in thinking about it for that long youve given the movie more attention than the filmmakers did. Perhaps the foundational idea here was to provide a vehicle for Owen Wilson who sometimes gets mileage from playing good-natured oblivious guys who are unwittingly destructive. I prefer Wilson in his knowing scam-artist mode but in any mode hes an estimable comic actor when given half a chance. Here he plays Dupree the hapless friend of Carl (Matt Dillon) who has just married a beautiful rich girl Molly (Kate Hudson). Dupree has nothing going for him except that hes a really sweet guy no job no prospects no ambition no girlfriend. When Dupree finds himself without a roof over his head Carl brings him home to stay at his house even though he and his wife have just returned from their honeymoon and would like some privacy. Within one day Dupree proves an impossible houseguest -- he sleeps in the nude befouls the bathroom puts his voice on their answering machine and adds stations to their cable bill apparently settling in for a long indefinite stay. Its at this point that anyone would throw Dupree out. Its the nice thing about being best friends with somebody -- you can say ""This aint working pal."" Besides Carl and Molly are financially well off. They wouldnt even have to put him out on the street. They could move him into a cheap hotel for a week or two. Its one of the prerequisites of the houseguest-from-hell genre There has to be a good reason why the person cant leave whether its Sheridan Whiteside in ""The Man Who Came to Dinner"" or Blanche DuBois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" ""You Me and Dupree"" ignores that requirement past all sensible limits to the point that the characters are compromised. The story becomes downright unpleasant with the young couple experiencing serious misfortune as a result of Duprees presence. These misfortunes are presented as neither funny nor dramatic. Theyre just things that happen uninflected and given no meaning or purpose in Anthony and Joe Russos direction. Several possible avenues are suggested but none taken. At one point the idea is hinted that Dupree has an inner wisdom that Carl lacks and finds attractive but no thats not the case. At other times the idea seems to be that Dupree represents Carls freewheeling bachelor days which Carl regrets leaving but that angle remains unexplored. At still other times Dupree seems as if he might be intended as a mere comic nuisance a force of nature let loose in Carls life but the movie is too sentimental to pursue that direction. Instead its just a series of feints and gestures leading nowhere. Michael Douglas as always looking good in a suit plays Carls father-in-law whos also his boss. He asks Carl to adopt his last name to keep his family line going and later suggests Carl get a vasectomy -- once again a joke at cross-purposes. Isnt it interesting that Kirk Douglas usually played working-class characters while his son always plays big shots? Isnt it fun passing the time with thoughts like that when a movie is awful? The movie mainly follows Dillon whose job is to keep up with the storys nonsensical turns without looking foolish. He does and thats a major victory. Hudson does look foolish at times trying to pass off the movies fake emotion as real -- she deserves better. Wilson deserves better too. Hes too smart to make me believe hed actually think this movie is funny. -- Advisory Sexual situations.

A newly married couple (Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon) relax with their permanent houseguest (Owen Wilson left) in You Me and Dupree. Photo Universal Pictures You Me and Dupree 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Films are often carried on broad shoulders crossed legs explosive violence or splashy effects. But every now and then some glam Hollywood release gets lugged along by hair. Blond hair to be precise. Painstakingly highlighted ever-lovingly fluffed. Not since Farrah Fawcetts salad days has a layered yellow fleece so dominated a celebrity cranium as Owen Wilsons feathered muss dominates his in You Me amp; Dupree a film whose totemic comic image is the aerosol glamour shot in various states of frizz. His head can go from salon-fresh to total Franken-hair in seconds flat. Somewhere under that thicket Wilson has a forehead. Owen my boy What are you hiding from? Such a lovely face. Show it to the world It wasnt always so. Remember back in the day when the man had visible eyebrows? Bottle Rocket or Behind Enemy Lines. With the notable exception of Cars (no fringe on that baby) too many of Wilsons recent films have reduced his sensitive-loafer routine to two body parts the first being his scalp the second being his fetchingly pursed baby-doll smacker. I do not doubt the cinematic impact of either one. Wilson is a funny guy and an amiable one and if he never climbs out of this blow-dry groove of his -- there are worse things. Its good for a laugh. But Id bet Marge Simpsons beehive that he can do more. In You Me amp; Dupree Wilson is a down-on-his-luck layabout who moves in with newlyweds (Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon) and proceeds to make their lives heck. He sleeps nude on the sofa sets their house on fire that kind of thing. The film -- directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo who made the misfired caper flick Welcome to Collinwood -- has the familiar rhythms of any romantic/buddy comedy alternating between comic set-pieces and rancorous setbacks until all is forgiven in the final reel. It generates some guffaws The best bit a chase scene involves a stack of floppy disks and a security guard named Paco. A fantasy sequence featuring a Lance Armstrong cameo -- he pops up again post-credits -- is agreeably absurd and I was glad to watch Michael Douglas (as Hudsons businessman dad) slime his way through another Gordon Gekko paraphrase. Hudson is utter effervescence; Dillon is utter masculine blockheadedness. Their romance is sort of believable their troubles less so. You Me amp; Dupree is best when Wilson is on-screen mucking around with exquisite deadbeat timing baring his all -- or his almost -- as the situation demands. The other characters seem like an afterthought so much so that one key player Wilsons love interest is neither seen nor heard on-screen. The closest we get to spotting her is a tiny scene in which Wilson whispers sweet nothings into a car. Shes inside. Hes outside. Though its dark we can see his face and the golden mass that frames it. We cant see her. Like the film she exists only in the shimmering aura of Wilsons saffron hair. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post My mother loved the late Perry Como. Still does. But whenever the smooth-voiced singer would come on the Arizona oldie station KOY shed joke that the former barber was the laziest crooner around. It wasnt that Como couldnt be bothered to make a song pleasing. He always did. But he was just so darned relaxed. This is how Ive come to think of Owen Wilson as one of the laziest movie stars around. Sometimes the lax shtick of this Wilson brother - a movie trio that includes Luke and cameo-prone Andrew - wears thin. ""Cars"" for instance was a lesser Pixar vehicle for having Wilson behind the wheel as hero Lightning McQueen. But Wilson turns out to be the life force in ""You Me and Dupree"" a supremely slight comedy that stars Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson as newlyweds. When Carl (Dillon) marries Molly (Kate Hudson) Dupree stands by his side as best man (or ""BM"" as the insignia he requests reads). From his arrival - late naturally - on the Hawaiian island where the nuptials will take place Dupree proves to be that common comedy commodity the lovable misfit who is occasionally wise and nearly always forgiven. Michael Douglas plays Mr. Thompson. A successful real-estate developer hes the father of the bride and boss of the groom. From the moment he lifts his glass for an edgy toast at the rehearsal gathering hell make sure Carl never forgets these facts. Soon after Molly and Carls honeymoon Dupree tells his best friend that because he missed work for the wedding he was sacked. Because he was canned he lost his apartment. Because he lost the job he lost his second abode his car. So when Carl brings his mutt of a pal to his and Mollys house Dupree will have a shot at wrecking a second home. If ""You Me and Dupree"" sounds predictable it is. Brother directors Anthony and Joe Russo never shake off the sitcom rhythms they used to better effect on Foxs ""Arrested Development."" And while Michael Le Sieur wrote some swift lines those familiar with the playful wet-towel snap of Wilsons delivery will believe the best were improvised. (""If youre looking for a workhorse a Clydesdale"" he tells a potential employer ""Im not it."") Two love triangles clang noisily in this film. Carl Molly and Dupree make up the one of the title. But its not until Dupree and Molly begin to bond that this one amuses. When the unemployable layabout visits Mollys elementary school class on Career Day the movie and their relationship finds its sweet spot. But like a number of quasi-romantic comedies these days the core relating takes place between the fellas. And the threesome here - Mr. Thompson Carl and Dupree - speak to ongoing conflicts of the young American male. Thompson represents alpha dog power. Hes not going to roll over without a snarl. No one needs a volume of Freud to appreciate the subtext of Thompson giving his son-in- law a brochure on vasectomies. As for Carl hes lost his bearings - his ""Carl-ness"" says Dupree. Will he swing toward Mr. Thompsons greed-is-good posturing? Will he like friend Neil (Seth Rogen) continue to treat Molly like a mommy and not his friend and mate? Dupree offers a third way. Hes the wild card the potential trump card that wins in the game of life. At least that is the fantasy being hawked here. And amiable Wilson is one of the best hucksters in the biz for this particular product. ""The truth is some of you are going to just float along"" he tells the confused then rapt grade-schoolers. ""Some of you are going to languish until the mother ship calls upon you."" After a recent preview screening someone said to me ""That Owen Wilson what a fool."" Shes right When hes firing on all cylinders Wilson plays the trickster catalyst the knowing knave with charming lassitude. Now if only his accidental sage can find a fable worth his goofball wisdom.

You Me and Dupree Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/you-me-and-dupree-2006,200,youmeanddupree9,youmeanddupree,rogerebert
"As the third wheel Wilson crashes and burns - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW As the third wheel Wilson crashes and burns By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 14 2006 In some relationships a moment arrives when you look over at your boo and think ``Why do I love you again?"" After watching Owen Wilson as a shiftless bum in ``You Me and Dupree"" his tedious new sitcom of a movie Im prepared to dump him.A few years ago Wilsons lazy approach to Hollywood comedy seduced me. He seemed so much smarter than the movies he was in say ``Shanghai Knights"" (2003) or ``Around the World in 80 Days"" (2004). That stoned sideways strategy suggested a man who knew how to play dumb without looking stupid. But what was so fresh just a few movies ago is now just shtick.The thrill for me is gone though its not all Wilsons fault. The material here is bad (Michael Le Sieur wrote the script) and the careless direction by Anthony and Joe Russo shoves the action along. But the star whos as whiny and impossibly blond as ever is charmless.Unofficially ``You Me and Dupree "" is a companion piece to last summers ``Wedding Crashers"" a movie whose lunacy is desperately needed this summer. There Wilson and Vince Vaughn invited themselves to strangers receptions and poached the women. This movies premise is a lot less inspired Hes crashing a marriage by himself.Newlyweds Molly and Carl (Kate Hudson Matt Dillon) agree to let Wilsons Dupree who was Carls best man move into their nice suburban home after he loses what we can only assume is yet another job. His stuffed moose head board game and irritable bowel come with him. Soon a toilet overflows and a bathroom is fouled up (and not the one with the runny toilet either). Dupree has the guys over to watch football serves nachos on an heirloom tray and sets the living room on fire during a date. None of this prompts an eviction. In fact theres more where that came from.Maybe were meant to find an aimless jobless 36-year-old couch-surfer appealing. But during and after every transgression he just stands there oblivious. When a 13-year-old futzes around with the outgoing voice-mail message brazenly orders HBO or breaks into your secret porn stash its obnoxious. When a guy over three times his age does it -- then reacts like a 13-year-old -- its grounds for a shrink. Still the movie tries to force us into believing that Dupree is a free spirit not a loon.For comparison were shown Carl toiling thanklessly for his wicked father-in-law a big-time land developer played by Michael Douglas. These sections of the movie are like ``The Devil Wears Todays Man."" With Douglas and Wilson Dillon does comic exasperation surprisingly well but Wilson requires a counter-puncher both to keep him in line and egg him on. He needs Vince Vaughn. Otherwise theres no mischief.Dupree isnt even ambitious enough to make a move on Molly or to confess that hes been in love with Carl all these years. Only in America could a movie called ``You Me and Dupree"" not culminate in some sort of three-way.This year Hollywood has given us feeble men who evade adulthood. Matthew McConaughey wouldnt leave the nest in ``Failure to Launch."" Adam Sandler uses a magic remote control to make his problems go away in ``Click."" And Superman has returned from wherever lacking the gumption to tell Lois Lane he loves her.Wilson is the most intolerable of all. Watching him slack his way through this movie made me feel like Lou Dobbs. I didnt like Dupree. I wanted him deported.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

The notion of a clueless childhood buddy who intrudes on a couple just starting married life clearly has potential. But the way the characters are portrayed and the clunky manner in which the sophomoric situations play out result in no one caring what happens to any of the three principals. This is cringe-inducing humor at its most wooden. CLIP Watch a preview Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson are newlyweds Carl and Molly Peterson. Dupree is played by Owen Wilson who when with the right partner shines with his uniquely deadpan surfer-dude comic style. Well cast opposite Vince Vaughn in last summers Wedding Crashers Wilson was even funnier as the male model Hansel Ben Stillers rival in Zoolander. But Dillon and Hudson are clearly not the appropriate foils. Having lost his job his home and his company car Dupree temporarily moves in with Carl and Molly. Then he refuses to get a job or properly use a toilet plunger. He redecorates their tasteful home with tacky gewgaws throws a bash with strippers while Molly is at work and incites a scuffle with neighborhood children. Then he has a date with Mollys librarian friend and engages in some kinky sex that leads to a house fire. Clearly Dupree can do no right. But suddenly the filmmakers change course and Dupree turns into a sensitive romantic who idolizes Audrey Hepburn writes love sonnets and haiku refinishes hardwood floors and whips up gourmet meals. He bonds with Molly who confides in him about her increasingly distant husband. Then the movie turns on Carl who is shafted at every turn by his overbearing land-developer father-in-law (a lackluster Michael Douglas) by his newly metrosexual buddy Dupree and even by his now-disillusioned wife. There was no previous indication Dupree ever had a sensitive side. But now he is poetic accomplished and brainy ""catching up on back issues"" of Mensa bulletins even though for most of the movie he seems decidedly dim. In almost all of his scenes Douglas looks befuddled. No doubt hes as confused as the audience is about the nature of his character and those of his co-stars. You Me and Dupree is a movie in search of a premise and a comedy in search of what few feeble laughs it can elicit. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo worked on the clever TV comedy Arrested Development so they would seem perfect choices for a movie about a lovable man-child. Perhaps they needed a couple more story meetings to flesh the concept out. There was probably a funny movie in there somewhere just waiting to break out.

The tank is large -- who doesnt enjoy Wilsons slacker geniality or his sly comic timing? -- so the film wears out its welcome later rather than sooner. Before the first hour has ended theres a sense that weve already seen all we need to see of his character Randolph Dupree a perpetual adolescent who threatens to wreck his oldest buddys marriage by moving in with him and his bride after serving as best man at their wedding. Actually the plot takes a subsequent turn that might have been interesting had the movie been interested in character and the besieged newlyweds Carl and Molly are played engagingly by Matt Dillon and Kate Hudson. But everything depends on Duprees antics which are funny enough at first then less and less so as Dupree evolves from a strident life force into an implausible Mr. Fixit and finally finds his inner monster. ENLARGE The film was written by Michael Le Sieur and directed by the Russo brothers Anthony and Joe -- maybe the studio feared that a single director couldnt make the comedy broad enough. (Michael Douglas as Carls father-in-law does another of his carnivorous captains of industry.) Clearly no one connected with the picture knew how to end it; the last sequence depicting Duprees next step in life must have been a product of story-conference desperation. But sustaining it was a problem too since Duprees increasingly outlandish transgressions are covered by the law of diminishing returns. Nearly burning down the house isnt funnier than stopping up the toilets its just more photogenic. Last summer Owen Wilson co-starred with Vince Vaughn in ""Wedding Crashers"" which was a huge success and deservedly so even though it suffered similarly from problems in the momentum-sustaining department. The difference between the two films is instructive. ""Wedding Crashers"" had a dramatic engine along with Vince Vaughns prodigious motor mouth; it told a story with some complexity albeit in outlandish farce terms. ""You Me and Dupree"" is little more than a showcase for Owen Wilsons amiable shtick and a showcase in the merchandising sense of the term. The movie sells its scenes with big emotions and relentless close-ups. It sells Dupree as a free spirit even though theres reason to wonder if this manic Peter Pan shouldnt be institutionalized. It sells him as whatever the moment requires him to be -- an ignorant slob a reader of the Mensa Bulletin a pied piper a master chef. And by selling him with such shameless insistence it sells a gifted star short. The Groomsmen In Edward Burnss ""The Groomsmen"" old friends reunite for a wedding. Its hard to make a case for this affectionate comedy as a fully satisfying piece of entertainment; the filmmaking is often prosaic and occasionally plodding. Yet -- and this is an important yet in the context of todays soul-dead entertainment business (see above) -- the movie snaps sharply to life every now and then and its unfashionable decency really gets to you. The setting is the same one Burns has favored for more than a decade the contemporary New York City of white middle class suburbs (though the script doesnt feel contemporary and the neighborhoods -- City Island in the Bronx and the Ditmas section of Brooklyn -- seem sprung from some comfy time capsule). The writer-director plays Paulie a journalist of unspecified credentials whos about to be married to his very pregnant girlfriend Sue (Brittany Murphy). His groomsmen former members of a garage band include his big brother and best man Jimbo (Donal Logue); his cousin Mike (Jay Mohr) and his long-lost friend T.C. (a smart taut performance by John Leguizamo.) Like them Paulie is in his thirties but still stuck in the exurbs of adolescence where earlier hopes have been dashed and responsibilities beckon scarily. (These childish men are earnest versions of Owen Wilsons callow Dupree.) As one of the wives Heather Burns makes something lovely out of a sketchy role. Each man has a problem and each problem is dutifully explored. Thats the prosaic part. The most affecting parts are not the all-too-conventional confrontations but several moments when ""The Groomsmen"" puts its narrative on pause for the sake of a beguiling song or a good story like the one about Tom Seaver and the 69 Mets or the time Mike asked Sister Dorothy to go to the boys room and ... . You get the idea and you just might enjoy the movie in spite of its flaws. Leonard Cohen Im Your Man Leonard Cohen redefines the notion of a suit. Far from corporate he is a poet of dark moods and monastic inclination (although humor and austerity co-exist comfortably in his poetry); a songwriter who works long and hard at writing his songs and a gravel-throated troubadour who feels comfortable wearing suits because being a spiffy dresser was part of his birthright. (His father was in the clothing business in Montreal.) Lian Lunsons fine documentary ""Leonard Cohen Im Your Man"" includes a home-movie clip of the artist as a little boy decked out in shirt tie and suspenders as he pedals his tricycle gleefully. Its a fleeting but memorable image in a film that defines Leonard Cohen largely through the admiration of fellow artists who performed his songs at a tribute concert last year at the opera house in Sydney Australia. Their admiration borders on the reverential but reverence doesnt get in the way of their performances which are varied impassioned and thrilling. Cohen who is now 71 performs only once at the end of the film when hes joined by U2 in a studio setting for an extraordinary rendition of ""Tower of Song"" (with Bono singing backup.) Though some fans may find that disappointing the strength and beauty of Cohens songs is if anything enhanced by the treatment they get from such folk legends -- and legends in the making -- as Kate and Anna McGarrigle and Kates son and daughter Rufus and Martha Wainwright. (Two of the concerts highlights are Rufus singing ""Everybody Knows"" and Martha singing hypnotically ""The Traitor."") In interview segments interspersed through the music Leonard Cohen speaks of his life with a winning mixture of solemnity and self-amusement. Having lived for several years at the Zen Center on Mt. Baldy in Southern California he describes his Zen master -- whom we meet in situ -- as ""someone who deeply didnt care who I was... and the less I was of what I was the better I felt."" The more this film revealed of what he was and is the better I felt. In Brief ""Minis First Time"" is Bret Easton Ellis territory with palm trees explored by smarmy blunderers. Its a mirthless black comedy about a nihilistic young heroine who insists on doing whatever she pleases -- that includes matricide and turning tricks. Nick Guthes debut film turns the dubious trick of making Minis behavior simultaneously appalling and benumbing. In ""The Oh In Ohio"" Parker Posey is a frigid wife who warms to another man a local swimming pool tycoon played by Danny De Vito. Paul Rudds frustrated husband a teacher who drives a rusty Volvo wagon finds solace with one of his students a beautiful young woman with all the verve of a traffic cone. Billy Kents comedy makes much of masturbation and sexual aids and in that spirit takes great pleasure from its broad flat self.    DVD TIP Almost every character Owen Wilson has played is a spiritual descendant of Dignan the delusional master-criminal-in-training of ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996). This endearing debut feature was directed by Wes Anderson from a script that he and Owen Wilson wrote. The film also stars Owens brother Luke Wilson. He plays Anthony who has recently been released from a mental hospital and who finds love though no common language with a motel maid.

The trend started in earnest with ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Meet the Fockers"" and reached its pinnacle one might have thought with ""Wedding Crashers.""As it turns out this was only the beginning. Since then we have been subjected to such films as ""Failure to Launch"" ""The Break-Up"" and just this week alone ""You Me and Dupree"" and ""The Groomsmen.""All of these movies have in common a cast of 30-something male layabouts whose adolescence is way past its expiration date. (In this company Steve Carells 40-year-old virgin is practically a senior citizen.) Faced with domesticity they retreat into the confines of beery buddyhood. In the movies terms these sad-sack Peter Pans dont know whats good for them - i.e. wife kids a steady job. Behavior that might have looked cute in their 20s now looks pathetic. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Lets start with the most recent culprit. The Dupree in ""You Me and Dupree"" is Owen Wilson who seems to have made a cottage industry playing gangly goof-offs. Dupree is best friend to Carl (Matt Dillon) whose brand-new marriage to Molly (Kate Hudson) is a setback to their buddyness. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Carl works for his condescending real-estate mogul father-in-law (Michael Douglas) while Dupree doesnt really work at all. Through a series of mishaps he ends up living with Carl and Molly camping out on their couch and rapidly turning the house into a kind of frat lounge.As is true in all of these movies women are both nurturers and wreckers. Molly is a grade-school teacher and doting wife of near-infinite patience. She is also the enemy to all those guys who havent shucked off their inner satyr. (No wonder so few of these films are satisfyingly romantic.) Dupree represents the imp that Carl newly married is afraid to uncork. Carl broke the guy rules by finding a wife and now he must pay. As Dupree in all his innocence proceeds to dismantle his friends life we are supposed to see that he does it with Carls guilty complicity.I dont mean to imply that this film is any good or that it contains an ounce of genuine insight. But as a template for the big-baby genre its invaluable. One of the genres distinguishing features is that the babies like the women in these films serve a dual function. In the case of Dupree he is possessed of a strange wisdom despite all the pratfalls and posturing. Deep down he knows his friend has a good thing going with Molly and his hijinks are engineered to bring them closer. Hes a nonconformist in the service of conformity.This is what makes ""You Me and Dupree"" such a conventional experience. There is never a hint of malice in Duprees screw-ups and when quite accidentally of course he becomes a self-help guru we are meant to accept his success without the slightest irony. No con artist he.""The Groomsmen"" set in suburban New York is a more serioso gloss on the same guy themes. Paulie (Edward Burns who also wrote and directed) is getting married in a week to his pregnant fiancee Sue (Brittany Murphy). His four groomsmen come together for a final buddy-a-thon.Theres Paulies troubled brother Jimbo (Donal Logue) who cant face his caring wife; cousin Mike (Jay Mohr) who lives with his father and pines for an old girlfriend; Dez (Matthew Lillard) happily married with two sons; and T.C. (John Leguizamo) who left mysteriously eight years ago.The upstanding Paulie cant shake the feeling that marriage will change him for the worse by separating him from his friends. In the course of the film where each scene is pitched as a minitutorial in positive thinking he is made to see the error of his ways. Old resentments are worked out prejudices are eliminated and a blissful ending beckons.As in ""You Me and Dupree"" male camaraderie is both hailed and assailed. It represents a noble rite of passage that all too easily becomes a case of arrested development. The women in this universe are doting exasperated saints who rescue men from themselves. These films are saying that men left to their own devices are nothing more than porno-obsessed lunkheads. Only through the acquisition of a wife and family are they truly fulfilled. But as is often the case this homey fulfillment has an obligatory feel to it - it lacks the rambunctious authenticity of the goofball moments.As a writer-director Edward Burns is as industrious as an occupational therapist. He makes sure each of his people is well positioned for happiness. He offers a comforting view of life and on some level a dishonest one since we know that the problems raised in this film by infidelity infertility homosexuality and alcoholism are not so easily papered over.But at least Burns acknowledges that these issues exist. A movie like ""The Break-Up"" where Vince Vaughns Gary and Jennifer Anistons Brooke go mano a mano in their condo stumps for a relationship between these two warriors that any idiot can see is doomed. Gary is yet another big baby who wedges his bulk into the couch and plays video games to improve his mind. In the real world a guy like this would never last a minute with a culture vulture like Brooke but the filmmakers put them together because they want to see smoke rise.In ""Failure to Launch"" Matthew McConaugheys good-time Tripp is living with his parents while dating and dumping a series of bimbos. To get him out of the house his parents hire Sarah Jessica Parker as the lure with predictable consequences. The phenomenon of guys living with their parents into their 20s and 30s is a real one and ripe for comedy. But ""Failure to Launch"" - an apt title - doesnt know what to make of it all beyond a few giggles and winks.Great movies have been made in the past about male layabouts - like Fellinis ""I Vitelloni"" and Barry Levinsons ""Diner"" which demonstrated with a piercing poignancy the thwarted emotional possibilities of its young men.But for the most part these new movies feature guys with about as much personality as a whoopee cushion. Why are we seeing so many of them? Maybe because its tough to be an action hero in the modern world and so these yowling oafs of inaction are here to fill the void. Or maybe adolescence is being enshrined because the people who get to make movies now are as stunted as their protagonists.

"You Me and Dupreereviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up You Me and Dupreereviewed. You Me and Dupreereviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 13 2006 521 PM Get Off My Couch Owen Wilson in You Me and Dupree. By Dana Stevens Owen Wilson in You Me and Dupree The commercial ambition of You Me and Dupree (Universal) is right there front and center in one of the movies promotional taglines ""Last summer he crashed weddings. This summer hes crashing with the newlyweds."" This tepid romantic comedy wants to expand the Owen Wilson brand without making any big imaginative leaps from last years charming box-office hit Wedding Crashers. Presumably next summer Wilson will be crashing Jennifer Anistons labor and delivery or maybe Ben Stillers babys bris. Joe and Anthony Russo the directing team behind several classic episodes of Arrested Development have correctly calculated that Owen Wilsons particular brand of goofy sincerity can take the flimsiest comic material further than it really ought to go. Something about Wilson is just so comfortable so loose that he can make the most pointless movie seem by moments as if it deserves to exist. But even the presence of the Butterscotch Stallion cant sweeten this bland compendium of rom-com cliches. You Me and Dupree could just as easily be plotted on a flow-chart in the theater lobby saving its audience a 10-spot and 108 minutes theyll never get back. Advertisement Carl (Matt Dillon) and Molly (Kate Hudson) are a sticky-sweet newlywed couple whove been parachuted in from some gender-retro universe where pretty blond wives teach elementary school and natter on about their grandmothers china while their uptight husbands land accounts (wasnt Darrin on Bewitched forever ""landing the such-and-such account""?) and watch football with their bar buddies. Everything looks just peachy for Molly and Carls new life together especially when her zillionaire father Mr. Thompson (Michael Douglas) starts handing Carl (who in another throwback to 60s sitcoms works for his father-in-laws faceless corporation) some of his biggest land-development projects. But wait--it seems that Carls college buddy the eternal partier Randolph Dupree (Wilson) has lost his job and his apartment at the same time. Hell need to crash on Carl and Mollys couch for a while--not long just till he backs up the toilet orders premium cable and nearly burns down the house while seducing the school librarian. Wilson and Dillon are not without chemistry (though poor Dillon is given nary a funny or insightful line to speak all the way through) while Dupree straddles the line between winningly boyish and pathologically obnoxious. A fantasy sequence in which Carl imagines Dupree sailing on his father-in-laws yacht while his wife performs a striptease points toward the movie this might have been an exploration of the toxic rivalry between a nice guy who cant win and a golden boy who cant lose. One of Wilsons funniest performances was in Meet the Parents as Kevin the infuriatingly perfect ex-boyfriend of Greg Fockers (Ben Stiller) bride-to-be. Kevin was so angelic it was impossible to know whether or not he was a mere projection of Gregs imagination. If You Me and Dupree could free its mind to explore that kind of fantasy space maybe its ass and the audience would follow. As it stands one minute Duprees an insensitive frat boy sleeping bare-naked on his hosts couch the next hes weeping over Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. His final apotheosis (which will go undescribed here to preserve this predictable films one real element of surprise) makes for a funny coda but it seems to undercut the movies moral lesson about taking responsibility and growing up. Or is that the moral lesson? It might be just the reverse--that starchy guys like Carl need to take a lesson from the loopy Duprees of the world and listen to their own inner weirdness. If so its a tip the movie would do well to heed for itself. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Dupree A Sponge Holes and All washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Dupree A Sponge Holes and All Havent we seen this before? Owen Wilsons acting style -- wide-eyed pseudoinnocence -- becomes tiresome in ""You Me and Dupree."" (Photos By Melissa Moseley -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 14 2006 Imagine a sequel to ""Wedding Crashers"" in which Owen Wilsons John Beckwith moves in with the newlyweds -- and you get the idea of ""You Me and Dupree"" a formulaic shockingly sloppy and virtually laugh-free star vehicle for Wilson. As the aging Peter Pan Randolph Dupree Wilson once again plays the sun-kissed naif with a heart as golden as his meticulously messed-up locks. The question is how much longer audiences will accept Wilsons Bugs-Bunny-as-Beach-Boy shtick or whether his childlike rascally charm has begun to seem neurotically arrested. But the fault of ""You Me and Dupree"" doesnt lie just with its star. The big-studio debut of brother directing team Anthony and Joe Russo this is a textbook case of high-concept hackery a Chinese menu of a movie that has been haphazardly cobbled together by taking one from the ""Meet the Parents"" column and one from the ""Failure to Launch"" column (with a generous sprinkling of the aforementioned ""Crashers"" strewn about like so much MSG). The preternaturally well-midriffed Kate Hudson plays Molly Peterson the daughter of a wealthy real estate developer (Michael Douglas in the role Christopher Walken played last year). Molly has just married one of her dads employees a designer named Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon spending the capital he earned in ""Crash"" on a chance to go back to ""Theres Something About Mary""). Carls best friend Dupree has fallen on hard times and moves in with the newlyweds until he gets back on his feet. A series of slapstick incendiary and raunchy high jinks ensues as the interloper insinuates himself ever more thoroughly into his hosts lives. Do you really need to hear more? Can you see it in your minds eye? Do you spot all the dips turns sight gags and resolutions coming down Main Street? Of course you do. In a movie that reduces Dillons character and all husbands to whipped denatured creatures the sparks -- when they fly -- are between Hudson and Wilson who admittedly are terrific to look at. But with nothing to do but glower gasp and grin ingratiatingly they dont play characters as much as present themselves as impeccable screen objects; ""You Me and Dupree"" might as well have been called ""Dueling Highlights."" But the most egregious dereliction committed by ""You Me and Dupree"" isnt the waste of its on-screen talent but the laziness with which theyre wasted; if the filmmakers are going to sell out to a big studio the least they could do is put some of the budget on the screen. With its musical score composed of either needle-drops from ""About a Boy"" or the syncopated pizzicato-strings riff from every stock Hollywood comedy ever made ""You Me and Dupree"" even sounds hackneyed. As for visuals it seems that the Russo brothers chose to light their movie as if it were being filmed through an algae-covered aquarium. Artistically ""You Me and Dupree"" is a mess. Technically its an abomination. Spiritually its a void. Commercially itll probably be a big hit. And on a pristine beach somewhere Owen Wilson is leaning back munching on a carrot and gleefully asking himself the rhetorical question ""Aint I a stinker?"" You Me and Dupree (108 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content brief nudity crude humor profanity and a drug reference.

"You Me and Dupree | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; you-me-and-dupree ) You Me and Dupree (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli You Me and Dupree represents the second high-profile movie of the summer of 2006 to be mis-marketed as a comedy. As with The Break Up this stars one of the featured actors from last years surprise hit Wedding Crashers. However Owen Wilson isnt able to add more comedic pizzazz to You Me and Dupree than Vince Vaughn was capable of providing to his anti-romance picture. In actuality this is a flaccid drama with occasional ""humorous"" interludes. Unfortunately most of the humor isnt any more amusing than the serious stuff is dramatic. You Me and Dupree is a mess of conflicting tones and missed opportunities. The only one to emerge unscathed is Kate Hudson who exhibits qualities she has rarely shown since her breakthrough role in Almost Famous. Newlyweds Molly and Carl Peterson (Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon) have returned from their honeymoon to discover that Carls good friend and Best Man Randy Dupree (Owen Wilson) has had a run-in with Murphy (of Murphys Law). His recent list of misfortunes sounds like the refrain from a country music song he has lost his job his apartment his car and just about everything else he cant fit into a duffel bag. Carl without consulting with Molly offers Dupree the use of his couch. Dupree never one to miss an opportunity to freeload takes the invitation to ""make himself at home"" literally hijacking the Petersons answering machine ordering HBO and inviting a ""few"" friends over for a party. When an incident with candles and butter makes one wonder if Dupree is a Talking Heads fan Carl puts his foot down and asks Dupree to leave but like a bad penny he comes back. This time Molly is the sympathetic one and Carl is losing patience. Meanwhile at work Mollys father (Michael Douglas) - who is also Carls boss - has put the new groom under a lot of stress forcing him to work late hours and giving Molly and Dupree time to get to know one another. Directing brothers Anthony and Joe Russo spend a lot of time during the course of You Me and Dupree trying to develop a viable dramatic storyline. If only they had spent as much time on the comedy. With the exception of a few gags (including a couple involving toilets) and slapstick antics this film is devoid of potentially laugh-inducing material. Its not that the jokes fail - they arent there. The filmmakers want us to become invested in the lives of the characters to the extent that the humor ends up on the back burner. This isnt an inherently bad plan if it works. Sadly the characters in You Me and Dupree arent sufficiently humanized for anyone to care about them. Dupree starts the film as an obnoxious home wrecker. Then after a series of unfortunate circumstances he turns into a pathetic puppy dog who becomes housebroken. Carl devolves from a caring friend and husband into a boorish lout. The only one of the main trio who remains consistent is Molly and were not sure where her romantic sensibilities lie. For a while there are indications that she may be falling for Dupree. Then the script which appears to be going in that direction does an about-face. Its as if the filmmakers cant figure out who they want the audience to sympathize with. Michael Douglas is added as a one-dimensional villain but his contributions are so infrequent that he doesnt incorporate much to the proceedings. It isnt that Owen Wilson cant do drama - hes coldly effective in The Minus Man where he plays a serial killer - but his recent anchoring in comedies has retarded his range. His performance in You Me and Dupree is continually off - too saccharine on some occasions too earnest on others. Its hard believing in Dupree as more than a writers construct. That might be okay for a balls-to-the-wall comedy but it sinks a movie with designs on tugging the heartstrings. Matt Dillon rolls with the punches. When Carls a nice guy he plays him as such. When Carls a bastard thats what Dillon brings to the screen. The problem with this character is that hes badly written not that hes badly acted. At least Kate Hudson is consistently endearing (and oh-so-reminiscent of her mother Goldie Hawn). You Me and Dupree is one of those mediocre thow-away films that is destined to become lost in the mid-summer crush. Theres nothing about this movie that makes it stand out from either a dramatic or a comedy perspective. Quite the contrary in fact those expecting to get more than a handful of half-hearted chuckles are likely to be disappointed. Were it not for the A-list cast You Me and Dupree is an effort one might expect to move directly to video store shelves bypassing multiplexes altogether.

How about the corporate weasel who hid his killer moves beneath a heat shield of mock-gregarious ""Hey guy"" irony? Put the two together and you have Owen Wilson a slacker for the cutthroat age. With his surf-bum hair his broken nose and that voice that seesaws up and down grinding out each word with cracked pained sincerity as if he were trying to talk while holding in a bong hit Wilson has always led with his sexy-foolish natural-man charm. Yet if the voice is baked the mind is clear and its working overtime usually for himself. In Wedding Crashers he was perfectly cast as a scoundrel who used his soulful ""honesty"" to hustle women into bed telling them what they wanted to hear. His actions may have been deplorable but what made them so funny was that the romantic lies seemed to trickle right out of Wilsons good nature; its as if he lived to please and couldnt help that everything happened to work out his way in the process. No wonder Owen Wilson is a star Hes the first actor of his generation to turn innocence into sleaze then back into innocence again. From the moment Wilson appears as the free-spirited screwup of You Me and Dupree (yes hes Dupree) landing in a yellow prop plane in Hawaii the movie uses his crooked smile and craftier-than-it-looks faux doofishness as a subtle form of one-upmanship. Dupree is set to be the best man at the wedding of Carl (Matt Dillon) a land-development executive whos his oldest pal and Molly (Kate Hudson) a sunny grade-school teacher. The two enjoy an idyllic wedding but back home before they have a moment to savor their lives as newlyweds in walks Dupree toting a moose head and a ukulele (are you laughing yet?) desperate for a place to crash after losing his job and his apartment. It isnt his fault of course -- nothing ever is -- but we can see that hes the sort of infantile moonstruck underachiever who cant get a career going because deep down he doesnt want one. He just wants to drink beer and eat nachos and watch a big TV and pretend he never has to grow up. You Me and Dupree isnt a very funny movie (it preaches nonconformity in the rote style of an overlit sitcom) but Wilson at least keeps it afloat. The shrewdness of his performance is that he makes Dupree adorable and overbearing at the same time so that you cant separate the two. Carl and Molly start out united in their disdain for Duprees benignly reckless me-first antics the sight of his bare butt poking out from the rumpled couch covers his ordering of premium cable TV the fact that he seduces the librarian at Mollys school -- a nice girl a Mormon -- by doing nasty things with butter on the first date right in their living room just before he accidentally sets the place on fire. Before long though his hedonistic indolence begins to cast its spell. As a man in his 30s who still lives like a couch-potato jock out of college Dupree is destined to be likened to such recent child-man slobs as Matthew McConaughey in Failure to Launch and Vince Vaughn in The Break-Up. But whatever observations the movie has to make regarding the Gen-X tendency toward arrested development what were really watching is a less witty version of What About Bob? with Dupree as the innocent invader whos been placed on earth to drive Carl the humorlessly toiling overly rational middle-class breadwinner crazy. As Dupree a saintly pest lets his charm flow over Molly (he even writes poems) inviting her to enjoy life in a way that her systematic husband cant he becomes Carls nightmare the slacker id who succeeds by doing nothing seducing the world simply by letting it pass by. You Me and Dupree is a three-headed comedy in which the situation really goes all the way back to Green Acres where poor uptight Oliver Douglas was driven to frothing fits by his wifes fondness for the loopy neighbors he couldnt abide. If only this movie were half as hilarious. You Me and Dupree would have had more bite more comic anger if it didnt stack the deck by giving Carl an external reason for losing his grip His boss is his father-in-law (Michael Douglas clenching his teeth as if they were receiving radio signals) who happens to take a psychotic delight in abusing him. Matt Dillon is miscast anyway -- by temperament hes close enough to slacker nonchalance that we dont quite buy him as a yuppie control freak. The joke of course is that its really Owen Wilson whos in control. He cant play the dazed rogue forever but for now hes the happy master of that domain.

Proceeding from a conventional easy-laugh premise pic sidesteps the potential gross-out monotony of its setup by heading in an unexpected and dramatically effective direction though rarely eliciting more than a chuckle along the way. Threes a pleasant enough crowd in ""You Me and Dupree"" a middling third-wheel comedy elevated a couple of notches by the ineffably weird charms of Owen Wilson. Proceeding from a conventional easy-laugh premise -- a pair of newlyweds  forced to put up with an obnoxious houseguest -- pic sidesteps the potential gross-out monotony of its setup by heading in an unexpected and dramatically effective direction though rarely eliciting more than a chuckle along the way. Still the strong cast and genial execution should have broad demographic appeal making this a welcome (and financially self-supporting) lodger in Universals summer house. Land developer Carl Peterson (Matt Dillon) would seem to have a great life Hes just married a beautiful schoolteacher Molly (Kate Hudson) received a hefty promotion at work and moved into a classy suburban neighborhood. Unfortunately his new home is about to be crashed and partially immolated by his best friend Randy Dupree (Wilson) an affable blond bum who has just been fired and evicted and has nowhere else to go. Predictably Duprees ""temporary"" stay leads to all sorts of unwanted (and sporadically amusing) shenanigans involving skateboard accidents clogged toilets and some involuntary coitus interruptus as when Molly walks in on Dupree and his new girlfriend re-enacting a scene from ""Last Tango in Paris."" To their credit brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (helming their second feature after the heist comedy ""Welcome to Collinwood"") dont overdo the sight gags and keep up a fairly swift pace from one pratfall to the next. As Mollys patience with Dupree wears thin Carl faces even bigger problems with his boss Mr. Thompson who also happens to be his new father-in-law (Michael Douglas last seen with Dillon in ""One Night at McCools""). Thompson barely conceals his contempt for Carl undermining his projects and making insulting suggestions that he adopt Mollys last name and undergo a vasectomy. Merely the latest addition to Douglas roster of rich tyrannical CEOs Thompson is an all-too-convenient villain who turns Carl into an irritable crank forcing Molly to seek comfort from an unlikely source. As Dupree cleans up his act he morphs from accident-prone nuisance into lovable substitute husband -- a reversal that as worked out in Mike LeSieurs screenplay and played by Wilson comes off as surprisingly canny. Wilsons amiable slacker charm masks a wholly alert sense of comic delivery and crucially a knowledge of how to play annoying without annoying the audience. The character Dupree is smarter and more complicated than he looks -- selfish but selfless irresponsible but resourceful clueless but sensitive mediocre but inspiring. Much of the pics humor originates from the sheer silliness of Wilsons appearance; few thesps can wear a pastel-purple bandana with such imperturbable conviction. Offering solid support are Dillon whose suggestion of an underlying rage makes him an ideal straight man; and Hudson whose Molly is almost too sweet sensible and sexy to be true. Seth Rogen (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") also makes a potent impression as Carls even more obnoxious friend Neil offering an ugly alternate view of married life. If the Russos demonstrate a skill for directing actors their sense of resolution isnt at the same level. After several third-act stabs at humor that fall flat -- including a violent chase sequence that goes on far too long -- pic belabors its conclusion with a series of face-to-face reconciliations that feel obligatory. A random appearance by Harry Dean Stanton as a local drunk suggests the actors best scenes -- along with his reason for appearing in the first place -- were left on the cutting-room floor. Lance Armstrong also has a cameo thats decidedly inferior to his work in ""Dodgeball."" You Me and DupreeProductionA Universal release of a Stuber-Parent and Avis-Davis production.
