Updated July 30 2016  355 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Buy amp; Sell Goody-two-shoe fluff The Perfect Man proves only slightly better than A Cinderella Story DAVID GERMAINAP Movie Writer Jun 17 2005 Finding the perfect man for Heather Locklear has always been a problem. Her husband and the boys from ""Waynes World"" aside what man in his right mind would give her a second glance? Come on show of hands. Lets see every American male between 12 and 112 whos not on a respirator? OK we stand corrected. Locklears stunning looks and winsome personality remain in full bloom in ""The Perfect Man"" though the filmmakers try to dull her down a bit by making her a single mom working in a bakery who has some desperate emotional bent for hooking up with losers. Even so the woman you see on screen should have men lined up around the block. Thats the first fatal flaw to ""The Perfect Man"" starring Hilary Duff as Locklears teenage daughter who tries to salve her moms romantic pangs by creating an ideal -- but fictional -- beau. The second fatal flaw The movie is a toxic buzz of sweetness that Duffs teen gal fans might lap up while all others suffer through a prolonged sugar fit. Director Mark Rosman delivers a marginally better movie than last years ""A Cinderella Story"" the lousy teen fairy tale in which he also directed Duff. Her young fans made that movie a modest success and ""The Perfect Man"" presents more of the same goody-goody Duff shenanigans for them to savor. Duffs Holly Hamilton her typical angelically mischievous high schooler is tired of the endless uprooting each time her mom Jean (Locklear) moves the family after bad breakups with men. When the latest jerk dumps her Jean relocates with Holly and her younger daughter Zoe (Aria Wallace) to New York City where they find an oddly spacious and charming apartment on a lowly bakers salary. But then no one expects a Hilary Duff flick to take on the financial dilemmas of single parenthood. In New York Holly begins a little romantic dance with hunky classmate Adam (Ben Feldman) and makes instant friends with another student Amy (Vanessa Lengies) who becomes Ethel to Duffs Lucy as Holly schemes to make her mom stay put for once. Hollys worried because Jean has begun another dicey relationship with co-worker Lenny (Mike OMalley) a devotee of the rock band Styx whos a nice guy but in Hollys view the latest in a string of men bound to break her mothers heart. To push Lenny aside and keep Jeans lovesick blues at bay Holly creates the perfect suitor based on Amys uncle classy restaurateur Ben (Chris Noth). Fictional Ben sweeps Jean off her feet with flowers e-mails and online chatroom heart-to-hearts. The proverbial rocket-science degree is not necessary to figure out who the real perfect man for Jean might be. Screenwriter Gina Wendkos (""The Princess Diaries"") piles on the Duff fluff the movie essentially a series of gags and scenarios that range from implausible to outlandish. The saccharine is thickly and sickly applied reaching a gag-reflex zenith with a nauseating mother-daughter dance montage in the Hamiltons living room. Teen crowds will find Duff and her new playpals as cute as ever but the grown-ups are the strong suit in ""The Perfect Man."" Locklear and Noth are fetching and funny separately and while they share only a few moments on screen they show a hint of chemistry that makes you wish for more. Now that the teens have their sugar fix someone should do the adults a favor and come up with a smart romantic comedy starring Locklear and Noth. Lets say a love story between a couple of divorcees. Neither with kids. onscreen ""The Perfect Man"" Grade C Starring Heather Locklear Hilary Duff Aria Wallace Ben Feldman Vanessa Lengies Mike OMalley Chris Noth Director Mark Rosman Rated PG for some mildly suggestive content Latest in section Game of Thrones to end after season 8 but 7th still ahead Game of Thrones to end after season 8 but 7th still ahead Kelly Ripa not saying who shed like as new Live co-host Outrage caution from Latino stars in critical election year Congo musician accused of assault is provisionally released Movie Showtimes | PrettyFamous Most Popular on nwi.com Fired prosecutor said she did not intend any wrongdoing UPDATE Gary infant didnt have body fat when he died Retired Hammond firefighter dies in boating accident Dozens of alleged Latin Kings members indicted West Calumet residents advised to relocate because of lead Currents Northwest Indiana Real Estate Listings Project Lab Quick and easy tool board pencil holder +26 National Sports Photo Galleries Gallery White Sox blank Cubs for 4th straight win National News DNC viewers guide Tuesdays roll call says it all Todays top pics DEM Convention comes to close and more Dog missing nearly 7 years reunited with family in Texas Your daily 6 Somber stop at Auschwitz cop killed in San Diego and Hillarys history Today In History July 29 Adolf Hitler Hues Turn coach Jackson determined to rebuild bad Browns Australias Penny Taylor set to retire at end of WNBA season Saints Payton wary of wearing players out at training camp Athletes in Rio Olympics refugee team luckier than many 146 Ndn AP video Despite wins in Wisconsin road to nomination still steep for Ted Cruz Bernie Sanders 205 Ndn AP video Young refugees in US inspired by Olympics 201 Ndn AP video Homeless New York City sisters head to Junior Olympics 046 News Raw video People flee Germany mall shooting Find local businesses View local offers Local Businesses Alberts Diamond Jewelers 711 Main St Schererville IN 46375 45th Street Tattoo 1817 West Glen Park Avenue Griffith IN 46319 Bamp;E Recreation 1006 US Highway 30 Valparaiso IN 46383 Christenson Chevrolet Inc 9700 Indianapolis Blvd Highland IN 46322 Business Directory Latest Local Offers One Guy With Tools Call One Guy With Tools to learn all about our Home Protection Inspection Plan Updated Jul 27 2016 Stevenson and Fairchild OMS Stevenson amp; Fairchild OMS uses the most advanced technology to ensure excellence of diagnostics and treatment.

Comments The Perfect Man Wholesome Hilary Duff has a problem her knockout single mother (Heather Locklear) keeps getting dumped and dragging her kids to a new town in search of romance. So to forestall another such move Duff plays matchmaker between mom and handsome Chris Noth. The premise is patently ridiculous but the target audience of 12-year-old girls will be too charmed by the genre requisites to care. These include a soft-rock sound track a cute boy who draws and comic relief from a limp-wristed gay waiter named Lance (Carson Kressley of Queer Eye for the Straight Guy). Mark Rosman directed a script by Gina Wendkos (The Princess Diaries). PG 100 min. By J.R.

She hopes that a captivated Jean will stay away from unsuitable men - but no-hopers still come a-knocking and Holly has to step up her game. She draws inspiration from her friends uncle Ben (Chris Noth) by grilling him on romance and composes saccharine emails designed to make poor insecure Jean feel loved - never mind that a bright pleasant woman who looks like Heather Locklear could have bagged a millionaire with a heart of gold by now. One supposes that the prospect of Jean and Bens eventual meeting is designed to create tension but Hollys attempts to prevent this from happening (as it would expose her deception) merely irritate. Unfunny set-pieces are punctuated by quasi-romantic interludes as Ben spouts cliches and Holly ignores the perfect man right under her nose. None of the leads convince or engage and supporting characters are either gay stereotypes routine little sisters or functional best friends. Rather than a romantic comedy this prim PG is a saccharine family drama which overpowers any prospect of genuine sweetness with its dull deceitful characters. And lets face it there was never anything particularly appealing about a girl trying to seduce her own mother in the first place.

Theatrical play seems a mere formality for ""The Perfect Man"" a wan romantic comedy destined for heavy rotation on family-skewing cable networks. Hilary Duffs name-above-title presence may attract teen girls (and the boys who date them) in sufficient numbers for modest opening-weekend coin. But quick fall-off should accelerate fast-forward to homevid and other ancillaries. Working from story credited to Michael McQuown Heather Robinson and Katherine Torpey scripter Gina Wendkos has cobbled together by-the-numbers scenario that occasionally recalls 1999 releases ""Anywhere But Here"" and ""Tumbleweeds."" Much like those two far more substantial pics ""Perfect Man"" pivots on the relationship between footloose mother and increasingly disapproving daughter. In this case however situation is mined mostly for mild chuckles and tepid sentiment. Single mom Jean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) overreacts whenever she realizes that her boyfriend is the latest in a long line of losers. Indeed every time her heart is broken she packs up her kids -- 16-year-old Holly (Duff) and 7-year-old Zoe (Aria Wallace) -- and moves to a different city. Latest migration takes family to Brooklyn where Jean -- who spends more time baking confections than any screen character since Mildred Pierce -- lands work at bakery run by an old buddy (Kym Whitley). After being uprooted so many times Holly is reluctant to begin new relationships and her view of Mom as a monomaniaclly selfish woman would seem to hold more than a little truth. But Holly finds a new friend in Amy (Vanessa Lengies) a spunky Brooklynite and even recognizes romantic potential in Adam (Ben Feldman) another classmate. So shes deeply concerned when Jean appears poised to repeat the same old mistakes by hooking up with Lenny (Mike OMalley) a fellow bakery employee whos entirely too fond of 80s hair bands and muscle cars. To distract her mother from an obvious Mr. Wrong Holly invents a ""secret admirer"" to woo Jean with flowers love letters e-mails and other tokens of esteem. Since this is a family-skewing comedy and not an episode of ""Law amp; Order Special Victims Unit"" Jean assumes her unseen beau is a sweetie not a stalker. Trouble is Holly is hard-pressed to sustain the hoax and soon turns to using unwitting input from Amys uncle hunky restauranteur Ben Cooper (Chris Noth). Holly borrows character traits life lessons and even a first name from Ben to make her imaginary gentleman caller all the more believable. One thing leads to another -- though not very quickly alas -- as helmer Mark Rosman plods toward a series of happy endings to reward almost every character on screen. (Poor Lenny gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop which may upset auds amused by OMalleys surprisingly engaging performance.) Pic feels padded by a good 10 or 15 minutes and the slow pace gives aud far too much time to question whats said and done (and left unsaid) by characters. Locklear does her best to tone down her glam quotient. And Noth is appealing in a thinly written role. But pic is Duffs world and everybody else is just a satellite. Young actress is well cast and more than competent easily handling the slangy narration. For most part ""The Perfect Man"" is too bland to merit anything more censorious than a stifled yawn. Even so Carson Cressleys broad portrayal of a mincing gay bartender at Bens restaurant may offend those who make a point of being offended by such things. Unusually drab lensing by John R. Leonetti may look slightly better on TV screens. Toronto locations adequately sub for Brooklyn. The Perfect ManProductionA Universal Pictures release of a Marc Platt production.

"Hilary Duffs Ill-Conceived Perfect Man washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Hilary Duffs Ill-Conceived Perfect Man Heather Locklear playing a self-indulgent mother is the grownup in this poor attempt to make Hilary Duff right a star. Aria Wallace center acts adorable. (Universal Studios Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 17 2005 Baby when you walk out of a movie thinking ""Say that Heather Locklear was pretty darn good"" the movies got some problems Locklear is indeed the best thing in ""The Perfect Man"" in which shes cast as a far-from-perfect woman a woman of narcissism frivolity self-indulgence but also under it all an abiding decency and love for her children. No its not Oscar material but the longtime TV star grounds the lighter-than-air thing into some semblance of reality and gives it something about which to revolve. And boy does it need grounding. Otherwise ""The Perfect Man"" is another misbegotten attempt by someone who should know better to turn Hilary Duff into a movie star and I cant imagine itll do any better than the recent failures ""Cinderella Story"" and ""Raise Your Voice."" Gack it continues A quick look at the Internet Movie Database reveals there are no fewer than three more Duff vehicles in the works. Why good God why? Not to be too rough on one so young but its hard to see a single thing about the pleasant but eminently forgettable Duff that makes her so essential to todays Hollywood. Anyway the movie sets itself up like Billy Wilder with training wheels -- a cynical premise but whose bittersweet meaning is completely contradicted by its saccharine execution in a way that would sicken Wilder. Isnt anybody grown-up supervising this stuff anymore? Locklear and Duff mother and daughter Jean and Holly Hamilton are encountered in Wichita where It Happens Again. It Breaking Up always hard to do. That is perennially immature single mom Jean (Locklear) has just dumped boyfriend No. 39 or 57 or something and as usual needs to leave the area and Begin Anew (people in movies are always Beginning Anew while those of us in reality are stuck for life). Thus theyre off (with a second child oppressively adorable Aria Wallace) in a screen wipe to Brooklyn itself oppressively adorable and scrubbed free of trash human and material and made to look as wholesome as the burb where Father Jim Andrews knew best all those years ago. Brooklyn? Come on There Jean gets a job as the worlds most highly paid bakery clerk -- how else could they afford that three-bedroom apartment with wood floors and balcony? Daughter Holly (Duff) slips into school without a riffle of discomfort finds friends and support and nurture. She decides she likes it; she wants to stay. But she knows her mom will fall for a lout and in five weeks or so dump him and off theyll go to yet another place and temporary life. Holly comes up with a plot to prevent that. She decides to fake her mom into falling in love (via e-mail) with a phony Perfect Man knowing that the stability and security will cultivate moms nesting tendencies and theyll stay put. But she doesnt know what a perfect man would be so she decides to base him on her new best friends Uncle Ben (Chris Noth) a restaurateur or bistroteer down by the riverfront. And why is this fellow perfect? Beats me. Beats Mark Rosman too and he should know He directed the movie. Meanwhile in the puppy-love department Hollys being goo-goo-eyed by another adorable presence Adam Forrest played by Ben Feldman. To call the relationship that follows chaste is to undersell it considerably Its sexless hapless and hopeless. Feldmans okay in a role that asks little of him beyond benign acceptance of the Duff goddesshood. Now and then ""The Perfect Man"" stirs to life but mostly its Duff in her heavy eye makeup and tight jeans welded shut (oof) running around acting harassed and embarrassed. The central conflict develops after about seven hours She realizes that Ben indeed would be perfect for her mom but now shes got to contrive to keep them apart to keep the deception going. This yields one deft scene where she must engineer a diversion when it transpires that mom and pals have headed for Uncle Bens bistro. Its farce -- knockdown crackerjack fast and if not furious at least slightly heated -- that produces a few genuine laughs. But mostly the movie produces yawns when its not producing awe that someone even bothered to make it. Noth who showed some charm in ""Sex and the City"" seems to have forgotten all about it here but hes not in the film that much to matter anyway. Then the movie only marginally faces the ugliness of manipulation and deceit at its center. It suggests that the cruel trick the kid plays on her mom can be forgiven and forgotten in a single conversation with no time necessary for healing. And in truth it has to be said the movie rewards its star with a happy ending for her ugly behavior The plot against Mom basically works and the lesson communicated isnt girl power but lie power. Are we sure this is what we want to tell the young adults for whom the movie was clearly intended? The Perfect Man (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some mild sexual suggestiveness.

Pretty much perfectly. By Mick LaSalle Published 400 am Friday June 17 2005 The Perfect Man Comedy-drama. Starring Hilary Duff Heather Locklear and Chris Noth. Directed by Mark Rosman. (PG. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Even the actors look embarrassed at some of the things they have to say in ""The Perfect Man"" and not just Chris Noth who is used to good material or Heather Locklear who after 20 years might reasonably think she deserves some. No Hilary Duff looks embarrassed too. At times a look crosses her eye that practically screams at us ""I know this makes no sense I know the character Im playing would never do this I know the lines Im saying dont logically connect from one sentence to the other and I know this movie is a mess But its not my fault"" And its not Hilarys fault. OK so she scrunches up her face to indicate every emotion from pensiveness to wild distress and she uses querulousness as a default response to nearly everything. So what? She can almost act and she doesnt bother anybody. A little girl in the audience can look at Hilary and think ""Thats who I want to be when Im in high school."" Thats a modest but worthy position to hold in the entertainment cosmos. No one expects Hilary Duff to be Judi Dench. The strange thing about ""The Perfect Man"" is that it might have been an interesting movie if it had been committed truthfully to the story it presents. Hilary plays Holly a high school girl with a neurotic single mom (Locklear) who flits from man to man and each time one dumps her she insists on uprooting the family and moving to another part of the country. Theres the seed of something there Mommy is crazy. The most recent relocation is to Brooklyn where Mom gets a job in a bakery. Because Holly wants to stay in Brooklyn -- mystery enough -- she decides she needs to make her mother happy. And so she invents a secret admirer for poor erratic emotionally fragile Mom. She sends Mom orchids writes her romantic letters and sends her cozy e-mail. Its a twisted and potentially fruitful plot element Holly is a selfish sadist. But alas ""The Perfect Man"" is not a searing psychological thriller about a crazy mom and her sadistic daughter. Its a comedy of sorts but without anything to laugh at. To be exact the movie belongs to a genre that has never been formally identified but turns up fairly often the frivolous drama. Thats a movie in which mainly serious things happen but the audience is encouraged to watch as though nothing matters. In frivolous dramas emotions arent emotions and conversations arent conversations and theyre not meant to be. Theyre stand-ins for the real thing intentional fakes meant to leave us untouched and yet mildly stimulated. Chris Noth looking good and very much at ease plays a restaurateur whom Holly knows through a school friend. She uses him as the prototype for her moms secret admirer and even includes his picture in a love letter. Of course once her mom has the photo one expects that he and Mom will accidentally meet. The laws of comedy demand it. But this is a frivolous drama and frivolous dramas operate according to their own rules. The last half of ""The Perfect Man"" goes to the edge of the earth and falls off it. Mom and Holly have the inevitable conversation in which they lash out at each other and feel better about it afterward. We dont feel any better but at least they get through some stuff. Then the timeline goes haywire. In one scene it seems as if only a day or two has passed -- except that something else has happened to indicate the passage of at least a year. Theres no unraveling it. Theres just the matter of facing it that ""The Perfect Man"" is just something slapped together -- by people who dont care for an audience they figure will care even less. -- Advisory Some mild sexual situations and lying to ones parents.

Come on. And Duff is just fluff.By Karen Heller INQUIRER STAFF WRITERPosted June 17 2005Once upon a time there were made-for-television movies. Now there are made-for-television movies for movie theaters. The Perfect Man another anemic Hilary Duff vehicle is a case in point.This project is so misguided as to cast TV vixen Heather Locklear as a sweet working-class victim in jeans() when everyone knows she owns the market on shrewish executrix mansharks in toast-size skirts.Nobody dumps Locklear.Yet in The Perfect Man shes perennially dumped and desperate. Trust me Locklear doesnt do desperate.Not convincingly that is.She packs up and moves every time her heart shatters (that is every few months) with her two daughters in tow. Duff twice her size in twice the makeup (Turner landscapes display less grandeur) decides enough is enough once they roost in Brooklyn and she goes about concocting the perfect mystery man for mom via orchids and e-mail Cyrano-style - without the poetry.As a muse Hilary (Holly in the movie but do you care?) calls on her new Best Friend Forevers Uncle Ben (yes Uncle Ben) a suave restaurateur - as if theres any other kind - played by Chris Noth looking as much a gravlax out of water as Mr. Big in an outer borough.Ben is perfect for Heather because they both do crossword puzzles in pen. She makes divine brownies and he terrific ice cream. Hes got a dream kitchen and she needs one plus a decent colorist.The script is gag-inducing to the point of insulting a lot of ""youre looking for the perfect man when you dont see the perfect woman you are"" blather. Its an appetite suppressant.The Perfect Man features yet another precocious tyke in glasses (Aria Wallace) and a follow-your-bliss lesson where Heather tried to find the confidence and courage to I kid not enter a cake-decorating contest that will - not to give the plot away or anything - Forever Change Her Life and upgrade her apartment job and love life.Duff lost out to Lindsay Lohan in the teen queen sweepstakes though fortunately she still looks like a teenager and not Kate Moss. Duff keeps picking retread scripts (not a good move repeating yourself at the ripe age of 17) and working with the same folks. Perfect Man was directed by Mark Rosman helmsman of the equally negligible A Cinderella Story.As an actress Duff has failed to grow except in acquisition of highlights showing an emotional range running the gamut from pout to sulk.Her hair flicking however as well as the lower-lip quiver are incomparable.Preteen girls hooked on Duff will be placated by such fluff. My 9-year-old companion thought The Perfect Man was worth a constellation of stars. (If Universal blurbs those last four words attorneys are standing by.) Utterly lost on her - thank goodness - was the suggestion that Locklear might be an ankle bracelet away from hussy or that its a tad icky to have a daughter romancing her mother via the Internet even if it is in the interest of attending the prom.For the record Duffs love interest who-just-so-gets-her this time around is the dreamy bovine-eyed Ben Feldman a would-be cartoonist and yet another variation on The O.C.s divine Adam Brody - without the wit.The Perfect Mans most novel turn is having Styx vocalist Dennis DeYoung as the keyboardist-vocalist in a Styx cover band. It also says something that the best performances are given by Mike OMalley (from the TV series Yes Dear) as a Trans Am-driving Styx fanatic and Queer Eyes Carson Kressley in his debut ""acting"" job. He plays a bartender who exclaims to a construction crew ""Am I a Jets fan? Im a huge West Side Story fan.""Perhaps you had to be there.Or then again not.Contact staff writer Karen Hellerat 215-854-2586 or khellerphillynews.com.The Perfect Man (out of four stars)Produced by Susan Duff Marc E.

"Tired of the typical Hilary Duff? Dont bother catching her latest - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Duff Tired of the typical Hilary Duff? Dont bother catching her latestmovies - review - The Perfect ManJune 17 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticIts not easy being Hilary Duff in a Lindsay Lohan world.Theres Lindsay grabbing headlines thanks to her loopy dad her lip-locking with Bruce Willis her breasts allegedly requiring digital reduction in the ads for her latest Disney ""family"" comedy Herbie Fully Loaded.And heres Miss Duff doing what Miss Duff always does -- shes squeaky clean put-upon shy innocent. Her fans expect nothing less. And nothing more. That of course is the trouble.The Perfect Man her latest doesnt vary the formula. Shes got a competent supporting cast -- eternal hottie Heather Locklear plays her mom; equally hot Chris Noth is a pals uncle who gives Hilarys character romantic advice.But its a wan little thing much like Duff herself. The movie is a reflection of the sort of roles she always plays. Its shy about addressing anything that requires a moments thought -- selfish irresponsible parents selfishly bratty kids lying talking others into lying.And Duff does her shy bit too. She hunches her head down and scrunches up her shoulders to show us how insecure she really is under 140 worth of eye liner. Ive seen all of her movies and cant recall seeing her neck. Or her acting.Her character here Holly is 16 and fond of low-cut pants and lower necklines. But shes never dated or been to a school dance.Shes always lonely because her selfish mom keeps moving her from town to town running away from failed love affairs. And yet Holly seems to find an instant best pal wherever she goes even Brooklyn where she hooks up with Amy played by Vanessa Lengies who cant quite remember to try the Brooklyn accent in every scene.Amys Uncle Ben (Noth) runs a restaurant. He seems to know all about women. He advises the girls unknowingly on how to woo her mom. Holly has decided to do this because Moms track record for picking losers started basically when she was born. Its implied that Mother Heather had Holly and Hollys younger sister out of wedlock.Holly is embarrassed by her mom. Maybe ""the perfect man"" will make her less embarrassing. The fake Internet romance might save her from the baker at her latest job moony Styx-loving stuck-in-the-80s Lenny played with not quite enough verve by Mike OMalley.And all that sneaking around makes Holly too busy to notice pretty and sensitive artist-boy Adam (Ben Feldman) who draws comics about Princess Holly.Catnip to the kiddies to be sure. But that ""child invents a secret admirer for a lovelorn adult"" bit -- even Duffs fans have seen that on TV six or seven times by their 14th birthdays.Duffs comfort zone extends to her director. Mark Rosman did some episodes of her TV show Lizzie McGuire and directed her in A Cinderella Story.He directs like a sitcom veteran waiting for a laugh track to bail him out. Shell never stretch with him around.Duff has a pleasant enough niche for herself. But thats not much to hang a career on. She hasnt managed a Mean Girls a Saved or anything else that suggests she will have work when her peers outgrow bubble gum.Not to say that yet another starlet should grow up too fast. But any kid old enough to have seen Duff on Lizzie McGuire film will surely be bored to tears by her latest. Its formula. She has as the title suggests perfected it. Lets move on.

With Hilary Duff Heather Locklear Chris Noth. Directed by Mark Rosman. (136) PG Mildly suggestive content. 1.5 STARS. The tagline for ""The Perfect Man"" is ""Never Settle."" But someone sure did to make this nondescript piffle about a teenager who invents an online love match for her desperate single mom. Living a lie is never a good thing - as per countless after-school specials - so when Holly Hamilton (Hilary Duff) realizes she has to produce the mystery man she invented or else come clean about what she has been up to she screws up her face with all the cuteness she can muster and starts squeaking with the hopelessness of it all. I have a soft spot for Duff so I dont mind when she gets all Alvin-and-the-Chipmunks with girlish emotion. But the story has a definite ick factor that detracts from even the small pleasures the movie might offer its teen audience. Holly gets sound advice from a friends handsome uncle (Chris Noth Mr. Big of ""Sex amp; the City"") on how he might woo a woman like Hollys mom. But then in a weird reversal on the sex predators who disguise their identities in online chat rooms Holly impersonates this man online and flirts with her own mom. The movie tries to show us how Holly and her mom come to learn about and appreciate each other more through this subterfuge. But it raises the distasteful idea of a sexual E-mail vibe between parent and child. Heather Locklear plays Jean Hollys lonely mother and an inventive baker of cakes and confections. Jean is gorgeous fun talented and sharp yet the only man who asks her out is an easygoing slob who bakes bread in the high-end Brooklyn mart where she works. Locklear squeezes some fun out of their date to see a Styx tribute band. Still the bread man is all wrong for Jean. Holly invents the online ""perfect man"" to boost her moms self-esteem so shell make better dating choices. Sometimes the boy in class with a crush on Holly fills in at the computer conducting some of that wi-fi monkey business with Hollys mom. More ick. So the educational value of this movie wont be wasted heres the bottom line The perfect man is someone who sends orchids instead of yellow roses does the crossword puzzle in ink owns a restaurant much like the River Cafe and looks just like Chris Noth.

Everything is relative. We know this to be true because E=mc2 because a spaceman approaching the speed of light would age more slowly than the rest of us and because Hilary Duffs latest movie The Perfect Man is much better than her previous one Raise Your Voice. It has mostly charming actors. It has a mostly clever script. Its comic devices are mostly fresh or anyway not rotting alongside moldy lettuce at the bottom of somebodys crisper. In fact The Perfect Man is such an improvement over the stupendous amazing badness of Raise Your Voice that Im inspired to be bold be rash stick my neck out in the name of searingly honest criticism. Ill say its mostly good. Whether it is good depends upon ones point of view i.e. ones age and receptiveness to certain literary and After School Special archetypes. Being a 9- or 11-year-old girl is a good place to start although my daughters did carp about Duffs proclivity for scrunching up her eyebrows into little fuzzy peaks of befuddlement. But this is a minor irritant in a film devoid of major ones an unnecessary illogical yet entirely harmless teen caper that sparks up its derivative plot with just enough nerdy and disarming touches to keep it moving. It plays like a Disney Radio mash-up of Tumbleweed and Cyrano de Bergerac -- had Edmond Rostand written for the blogosphere. The plot unfolds as a rootless single mom (Heather Locklear) dumps her skanky boyfriend and hits the road with her two daughters looking for a new start at a Brooklyn bakery. Her older daughter Holly (Duff) tired of Mothers drifting ways vents to the masses from her Web site. When Mom starts dating Lenny (sympathetic Mike OMalley) a Styx-fan-cum-bread-manager who plays air guitar on a baguette Holly panics believing her hopeless mother is about to hook up with yet another loser preparing the way for yet another move to yet another city. Holly cant tolerate this. With the aid of an earnest pining boy (Ben Feldman) and a multiple-pierced classmate (Vanessa Lengies) she conjures up a fictional perfect man"" to distract Mom from the imperfect Lenny. She constructs this paragon of maleness from conversations with her classmates Uncle Ben (a laconic Chris Noth in a smallish sturdy part) a ladies man who speaks in flights of chest-heaving poeticism and psychoanalyzes womens needs based on their taste in music. So Holly starts e-mailing her mother as Ben. Which Ben knows nothing about. Which doesnt stop Holly from giving Mom his photo which makes her fall in love with him which prompts Lenny into some pretty fancy poetic flights of his own (the perfect man is standin right here next to my cuddles"") and sets up farcical kerfufflement in a few scenes near the end. Mark Rosman who directed a different sort of fairy tale with A Cinderella Story brings a (mostly) freewheeling goofiness to the films comic high points and yes there are a few. There are also a few stereotypes to contend with including Carson Kressleys obligatory Queer Eye manifestation of the fussy gay wisecracker. (Someday in the name of true diversity a Hollywood screenwriter will pen a role for an illiterate gay slob.) The Perfect Man isnt perfect but its not bad company for 100 minutes.

Aria Wallace center also stars. By  Michael Booth PUBLISHED June 15 2005 at 105 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 945 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Im about to give a fairly high recommendation to a movie that has so many things going against it that I may talk myself out of it within a few paragraphs. ""The Perfect Man"" is a Hilary Duff vehicle with other names tossed in to fill up the corners; its a remake of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Youve Got Mail"" from a weepy teenagers perspective; as a romantic comedy it fails to offer much hubba-hubba or ha-ha. And yet. Just when it seems easy about a half-hour in to write off ""The Perfect Man"" as eminently forgettable it turns into a likable story about women young and old finding their comfort zone. It folds romantic comedy tricks into a satisfying origami and makes Duff and Heather Locklear a mother-daughter combo worthy of our loyalty. Guaranteed a certain slice of box office money as relief for ""Star Wars"" and ""Batman"" widows ""The Perfect Man"" is better than it needs to be. Never fooling itself about the mark it is aiming for the movie hits close enough to the center to make a grateful reviewer go tame. Duff plays Holly Locklears long-suffering teenage daughter. Locklear a bit too gorgeous to be a serially jilted single mom opens the movie by cramming a cake in the face of a cheating boyfriend. The central premise of ""The Perfect Man"" is laughable but not quite a deal-killer Each time Locklear dumps a man she moves her family to a new city for a fresh start. Off to Brooklyn it is then where the second-least believable premise quickly appears Locklear somehow rents her two girls a charming apartment on a deli cake-decorators wages. Being its a romance we swallow and move on. Holly goes to her new school meets a couple of friends including handsome geek Adam (Ben Feldman) and then gets down to the serious business of imitating Lucille Ball. She wants her man-hungry mom to be happy so she invents a perfect suitor and starts sending flowers and notes. Clearly none of these characters has ever watched any old ""Lucy"" episodes or the hundreds of romantic comedies starting from the same idea. Making up a person never works except in the movies - and not very well there either. Chris Noth as Ben is the handsome restaurateur who unknowingly supplies the words Holly uses to lure her mom into romance. The old cliche gets some enjoyable airbrushing through mistaken identity Posing as Ben Holly writes e-mails to her mom and her mom opens up about the difficulties of single-parenting. Later mom poses as Holly in e-mails to help win back Adam and mom learns some hard truths about teenage honesty. And despite the awful title the basic message of ""The Perfect Man"" is that women shouldnt wait around for a guy to complete their lives. Runaway mom also gives a touching pep talk about sticking around and learning to live with the friends and the flaws youve already found. Next up for the battling teenage sweethearts is Lindsay Lohan in ""Herbie Fully Loaded."" Duff has found a formula that works on TV or on screen as a loving loyal and slightly confused high schooler.

"Perfect Man - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Perfect Man(anything but)Duff Locklear and Noth struggle but sink under hackneyed scriptTHE PERFECT MAN(star)(star)June 17 2005|By Allison Benedikt Tribune staff reporter""The Perfect Man"" is so 2005.Hilary Duffs character a fresh-faced teenager named Holly has a blog to which she posts while looking out the window like Carrie Bradshaws wholesome younger sister. And her single mom Jean played by a similarly fresh-faced Heather Locklear says things like ""Have you seen these lines? Im in a race against time"" with the only race the one between her cheeks and eyes to the top of her head.But still ""The Perfect Man"" is so 1982 billed as a ""romantic comedy about holding things together--even when everything threatens to fall apart."" Female heroines Holly and Jean a cake decorator move into a nicer home in Brooklyn than they had in Wichita and attend parent-children-teacher assemblies at P.S. In Your Dreams with students straight out of ""My Cousin Vinny.""Though actually ""The Perfect Man"" is so 1955 as Caroline Rhea channels Miss Adelaide for her appearance as Jeans gum-smacking sass-backing co-worker and Chris Noth plays a suave charming old-fashioned gentleman the kind who knows how to treat a classy dame.(Its also worth noting that with ""Queer Eyes"" Carson Kressley stretching for the role of a flaming homosexual bartender ""The Perfect Man"" is so 2003.)What this all means is that ""The Perfect Man"" comes to you in a bubble where time and place--the cornerstones of reality--are of no consequence and the only matter at hand is getting us to buy lines like ""Now I dont just have a homepage I have a home.""Rewind Jean a single mom to daughters Holly and Zoe is plagued by her tragic attraction to losers cheaters and hustlers. Each time a relationship goes bad Jean packs up the girls and hits the road. ""Adventure"" says Holly. ""Thats my moms word for running away.""Running from Kansas to New York Jean nabs a job at a great neighborhood bakery and enrolls Holly at yet another high school where she just happens to become fast friends with the niece of Ben Cooper (Noth) a debonair restaurateur and so-called perfect man. To prevent her mother from falling for another bad apple like Styx-obsessed Lenny from work Holly pumps Ben for courting counsel--orchids are for women roses are for grandmas--and uses his advice to create Jeans phantom admirer Ben.Along the way Holly falls for Adam a cute guy at school who draws comics but she has trouble giving herself over mind body and spirit for fear that Jean could shove her in a car at any moment. Instead she hangs out in Adams bedroom IMing her mother from ""China"" where ""Ben"" is ""opening a restaurant.""This all makes Jean very happy--so happy she could dance. So happy she does dance with Holly and Zoe singing backup in the living room as only daughters of single mothers in movies can do.As the Tribunes teeny-bopper correspondent Ive had the unique pleasure of reviewing almost all of Duffs movies and if theres one thing to say about the girl shes consistent nice sweet blond inoffensive and uninspiring. Shes an appropriate match to Gina Wendkos bland script and ""Lizzie McGuire"" vet Mark Rosmans workmanlike direction.Then theres Mrs. Richie Sambora. Not sure which Tinseltown genius thought to cast Locklear as a desperate housewife but putting aside her good looks which poor Heather cant be blamed for she does a pretty good job rising above the B-list material shedding her Heatherness and playing middle class.Eventually the web of lies unravels Ben and ""Ben"" converge and we all realize two things Noth is way too good for this stuff and blogs are totally over.`The Perfect Man(star)(star)Directed by Mark Rosman; written by Gina Wendkos; photographed by John R. Leonetti; edited by Cara Silverman; production designed by Jasna Stefanovic; music by Christophe Beck; produced by Marc Platt and Dawn Wolfrom. A Universal Pictures release; opens Friday.

Sure there are a couple of giggles provided by the filmmakers inept attempts to pass off parts of Toronto as Brooklyn Heights. And the erstwhile Lizzie McGuire eventually hooks up in a PG-way with a cute classmate (Ben Feldman) who passes his time drawing comic books about her. But most of this movie is beyond lame. It almost makes ""A Cinderella Story"" - the ever-mugging Duffs surprise hit of last summer - look like a real movie by comparison. In this one Holly (Duff) a seldom-seen younger sister (Aria Wallace) and their single mother Jean (the improbably cast and preternaturally ageless TV vet Heather Locklear) arrive in the ersatz Brooklyn Heights after moms latest romantic breakup. Though Jean works as a baker at a deli shes somehow able to afford a spacious three-bedroom apartment in a brownstone in one of the citys hottest neighborhoods. She is insecure and romantically desperate - hello this is Heather Locklear - and begins dating a fellow baker and heavy-metal enthusiast (Mike OMalley). Holly considers him a loser so the enterprising teen invents a fictional ""perfect man"" who begins wooing her mother by e-mail. The model for this paragon is Ben a pals smug uncle who runs a pricey Brooklyn cafe and whos played by Mr. Big himself Chris Noth. Holly converts Bens romantic platitudes into a series of mushy e-mails guaranteed to lull even the most hyperactive tweens to sleep. Somehow Mom falls for this even when Hollys nascent teen boyfriend pretends to be the perfect man on the phone calling from ""China."" Or maybe shes too busy practicing for the New York City-wide baking competition The script attributed to Gina Wendkos (""The Princess Diaries"") has scarcely enough wit or momentum for an episode of ""Lizzie Maguire"" yet director Mark Rossman (who also helmed ""A Cinderella Story"") stretches it out well past the 90-minute mark not to mention the limits of endurance and credibility. The good news in ""The Perfect Man"" is that Noth and Locklear have terrific chemistry together. The bad news is that they have only one short scene together near the end of this throwaway movie. -- THE PERFECT MAN [] (One star) Not even adequate. Running time 100 minutes. Rated PG (mild suggestiveness). At the Empire the Kips Bay the First Avenue and 62nd St. others.

The tagline to The Perfect Man is ""Dont settle."" It should have been ""Dont bother (watching this movie)."" Universal Its hard to say who is more insipid the overrated Hilary Duff or the lackluster Heather Locklear. Chris Noth plays a variation of his Mr. Big character from Sex and the City and seems to be going through the motions. But hes still the best thing about the movie. About the movie The Perfect Man  (out of four) Stars Heather Locklear Hilary Duff Chris Noth Director Mark Rosman Distributor Universal Pictures Running time 1 hour 36 minutes Rated PG for some mildly suggestive content Opens Friday nationwide To start the films premise is annoying Locklear plays Jean a single mom were supposed to believe is a good and caring parent. But shes so self-absorbed and obsessed with finding a man that she routinely hooks up with losers. When they inevitably break up she falls apart and drags her kids 16-year-old Holly (Duff) and 6-year-old Zoe (Aria Wallace) somewhere usually several states away. Locklears character scarcely realizes how painful this pattern is to her daughters. She even goes to a PTA meeting and instead of focusing on school issues brings up her need to find a good man under the guise of setting up ""mixers"" for single parents. We cringe right along with Holly as her mom makes her needs known. Holly -- possibly the most selfless teenager who ever lived -- wants desperately to persuade her mother to believe that she has a host of stellar qualities. Were not convinced. She pops out of her selfish bubble long enough to engage in the obligatory screen cliche the crazy dance montage with her daughters. Duffs Holly is more likable than her self-centered mom but shes hardly believable. After moving from a small town in Kansas to New York Holly decides to invent the coolest guy to woo her mom. Awww. Make that Ewwww. Wouldnt it be better if her mom did some soul-searching and stopped acting 16? Particularly when her own daughter has reached the same age? Hollys fictional perfect guy sends flowers and poetic e-mails. Surprise Her mother is smitten. Of course mayhem ensues as Holly struggles to keep up the charade. Noth plays Ben uncle of Hollys pal and a restaurateur who gives romantic guidance which Holly uses in her faux courtship. And -- what a shock -- its clear from the start that Ben and Jean are made for each other. The movies tagline is ""Dont settle."" Lets take that a step further Dont settle for such trite fare. Hold out for a movie worth your time and money.

"Perfect Man not found here - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | CAPSULE REVIEWS Perfect Man not found hereJune 17 2005|Carina Chocano;Kevin Thomas In ""The Perfect Man"" the moon exists ""to remind us that each day has the potential for beauty."" This according to Jean (Heather Locklear) a fancy-cake baker and single mother of two who would be better off remembering that each day has the potential for medication. Jean is a serial monogamist with a penchant for losers. Every time one dumps her she picks up the family and moves. Spastic parenting calls for drastic measures so when newly installed in Brooklyn (where everyone sounds exactly like Fran Drescher) Jeans daughter Holly (Hilary Duff) smells another bad egg in the person of Lenny the Styx-loving baker (Mike OMalley) and decides to play e-Cyrano. Inventing a perfect man for Jean to fall for sight unseen she models him on her friends uncle Ben (Chris Noth) the kind of sexy warm restaurant owner who always has time for inquisitive 10th graders during the lunch rush. Holly gets so caught up writing Jean love e-mails in an effort to prevent her from marrying Lenny that she overlooks her own perfect boy Adam (Ben Feldman) a cute artist who lets Holly commandeer his computer for her e-charade. Then she spends each wistful night confiding it all to her online diary. Sure it all sounds like a stretch but Jean is just crazy enough for it to work -- the plan that is not the movie. The movie is a tortured marshmallow. Its too disingenuous for teens (at least the teens sitting behind me at the screening who kept howling ""Wheres the moooon?"") and too mommys-going-on-Match.com-again disturbing for younger viewers. Seriously the perfect man would call social services.-- Carina Chocano""The Perfect Man"" PG for some mildly suggestive content. It suggests that mom gets around. 1 hour 40 minutes. In general release.Unrefined mystery afflicts an oil crisisSet in the near future during an oil crisis ""The Deal"" is timely and concludes on a bitter note of irony but it could have used a rigorous rewrite. The film might have worked as a taut topical corporate intrigue thriller; instead for all its ambition its just a routine mystery despite a solid performance by Christian Slater.Slaters Tom Hanson is a dynamic but principled rising star at Wall Street investment bank Delaney amp; Strong. For three years the U.S. has been at war with the Confederation of Arab States which has driven the price of gasoline up to 6 a gallon and wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy. Jared Tolson (Robert Loggia) chief executive officer at Condor Oil amp; Gas approaches Tom to handle a deal for a 20-billion merger with a Russian oil company.When Tom starts doing his homework he places himself in great danger but it actually doesnt start affecting him personally until a long-winded 45 minutes into the film.In a distractingly elaborate setup for a love interest for Tom the films heroine Abbey (Selma Blair) is a dedicated environmentalist and Tom has come up with a scheme to persuade corporations in need of tax credits to invest in companies sensitive to the environment. There is way too much going on in Ruth Epsteins script which leaves director Harvey Kahn plowing through it as best he can. With Colm Feore John Heard.-- Kevin Thomas""The Deal"" R for language and some violence. Complex adult themes. Running time 1 hour 47 minutes. Exclusively at the Beverly Center Cineplex 8522 Beverly Blvd. (310) 652-7760; and the University 6 Campus Drive and Stanford opposite UCI Irvine (800) FANDANGO 143.Kid holds English drama captiveWritten by Alison Hume and directed by Gillies MacKinnon ""Pure"" is an alternately sentimental and brutal tale of a 10-year-old boy (Harry Eden) struggling to rescue his widowed mother (Molly Parker) from heroin addiction. This is a conventional well-acted English working-class drama in the familiar realist style but it does not attain anywhere near the level of artistry and imagination of a Ken Loach film. Although deeply felt on the part of its makers ""Pure"" is manipulative on the one hand and at times defies credibility on the other. Nonetheless Eden who holds the film together by his winning presence and doughty performance effectively conveys the effect of severe challenges that no child should ever have to face. With David Wenham Geraldine McEwan Karl Johnson Vinni Hunter and Keira Knightley.-- K.T.""Pure"" Unrated. Heavy drug use occasional strong violence. Entirely unsuitable for children. Running time 1 hour 36 minutes. Exclusively at Laemmles Fairfax Cinemas 7907 Beverly Blvd. L.A. (323) 655-4010.

"Duffs Man Nowhere Near Perfect washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Duffs Man Nowhere Near Perfect Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday June 16 2005 Based on the true story of Heather Robinson who as a teenager invented an imaginary boyfriend for her single mom and conducted a romantic correspondence with her ""The Perfect Man"" is creepy as heck. Not as creepy as the original story to be sure but creepy lite. Even Robinson in an interview in Radar magazine says she doesnt see how the film starring the ever-insipid Hilary Duff as the 16-year-old daughter and Heather Locklear as her mother could possibly be as dark as her own experience and subsequent temporary estrangement from her mother was. No dark it is not. Try boring however. As written by Gina Wendkos (""The Princess Diaries"") the movie doesnt even seem to know how disturbing at its heart its subject matter is so that it can at least have fun with it. Instead it turns the events of the plot -- in which meddling high schooler Holly Hamilton (Duff) enlists the assistance of her best friend (Vanessa Lengies) her best friends hunky uncle (Chris Noth) and her own beau (Ben Feldman) in seducing her mother via gifts photographs phone calls letters and e-mails Holly herself composes -- into a series of cutesy but flat-footed jokes leading up to a foregone romantic conclusion. And if you cant figure out how its all going to work itself out 15 minutes in youre just not paying attention. Not that I could blame you. Even Carson Kressley of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" making an inauspicious big-screen acting debut as a vain and flouncy bartender wasnt enough to wake me from my stupor. Half of it was the result of progressively numbing amazement at this dysfunctional family and the other half sheer and utter boredom. The Perfect Man (PG 96 minutes) -- Contains a joke about flatulence and mildly suggestive humor . Area theaters.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Hilary Duff has a remarkable screen presence if only because not everyone can convey such effortless artificiality. Without mussing a hair Duff delivers her lines as if shed memorized them with the quotation marks intact. Shes a performer not an actor and she performs as if the successful completion of each scene could earn her a prize. It almost takes talent to do what she does. Almost. Duffs popularity with girls still on the ponies-and-rainbows end of adolescence has allowed her to carve out a place as the star of squeaky-clean high-school fantasy films in which sex drugs and rock n roll exist only as distant rumors. In The Perfect Man she plays the daughter of Heather Locklear a single mom whose career as a small-time baker apparently never gets in the way of her ability to tote Duff and her bespectacled younger sister (Aria Wallace) from city to city and tastefully decorated home to tastefully decorated home. Amid all the moves Duff keeps the online community sated with her frequently updated blog which serves as the films framing device. (A typical opening line ""Hey all you bloggers..."") After another in a series of failed relationships drives Locklear out of Wichita she drags her family to Brooklyn where she almost immediately hooks up with doughy Styx-loving loser Mike OMalley. To counteract this Duff invents a secret admirer and begins writing love letters to her mom and romancing her via instant messaging. All together now Ewww The film never delves into the situations ickiness especially since it quickly becomes apparent that Locklear will end the film in the arms of area restaurant owner Chris Noth the real-life inspiration for Duffs made-up lover-man. Naturally The Perfect Man takes the long way to get to point B from point A and for viewers of a certain age (i.e. over 13) its likely to seem even longer. Duff doesnt help matters. She shares a few scenes with a lovely orchid. The orchid nearly steals them from her. Where Locklears careful clipped delivery confirms that shes better suited for TV stardom than the movies every time Duff opens her mouth she confirms that her natural home is in magazines. Or voicing animated squirrels. Either one would work.
