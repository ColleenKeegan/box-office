"The Cats Meow washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies The Cats Meow Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 21 2003 ""The Cat in the Hat"" is so good it breaks your heart for not being better. It is kept from brilliance by a soggy climax and a clumsy central narrative device. But you say what else is there? How could there be much more? After all this is a movie adapted from a poem of a few hundred words about two kids alone in the house on a rainy day who are tempted toward mischief by an imaginary puss in a funny hat. Actually though theres quite a lot and why not begin with Dakota Fanning? The 9-year-old is breathtakingly fresh and funny in the movie in ways that are astounding. Well-trained child actors can usually do a very good job of following instructions given by grown-ups and they come across winningly enough as little mimics obeying their masters. The goddess of this technique was Shirley Temple cute as pie dimpled as a new Titleist but somehow weirdly disconnected from all that went on about her. She was so perfect she was kind of horrifying. Fanning seems on a different level. Shes actually acting in the most meaningful sense of the word creating in her imagination a character defining a personality for that character and communicating the characters internal states through nuance gesture inflection and presence. Its something called a performance not an imitation and shes eerily believable as Sally (you know the daughter of Mom that Sally) who is the prissy counterpoise to her more anarchistically inclined brother Conrad (Spencer Breslin adorable but not as adorable as Fanning). Sally is the kind of kid who puts ""Making tomorrows to-do list"" on todays to-do list right after entry No. 3 which is ""Be more spontaneous."" Sally represents that legion that swarming endless mass of good daughters who want so much to please and try so hard. Thus all that ensues in this film -- chaos the collapse of moral order the pursuit of the grail the descent into hell the flight from hell the vanquishing of the dragon and the miraculous restoration of moral order (and cleanliness) -- ensues twice. It happens in real space-time and once again more intensely as reflected upon the delicate face of Sally whose gradations of twitch and double take of tilt and turn of narrowed or widened bright-blue iris Fanning controls with the precision that can only be ascribed to genius. Dr. Seuss was hardly a gusher by nature and after 12 sweaty hours of coming up with three or four good rhymes he probably and sensibly retreated to the vodka. So the filmmakers must inflate. They inflate far less though than did the makers of the more ungainly ungodly and undead ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (2000) and they inflate far better. Heres the back story that sets up the ordeal by cat Single mom (Kelly Preston adorable and those legs why . . . oh sorry) works for Mr. Humberfloob an officious prig of a real estate agent played with toothy delicious pedantry by Sean Hayes. She tries to raise her two kids in a small Seussian burb Levittown as designed by an anal-retentive interior decorator with a Frank Lloyd Wright complex and a warehouse full of lavender paint. Two issues cloud the day. First it is Moms turn to host Humberfloob Realtys ""Meet Your Realtor"" open house which means her house must be perfect and so the kids have been ordered into a state of perfect stillness. The second is that her next-door neighbor an oleaginous unction in white shoes and mauve double-knit suit named Quinn played at the level of human stain by Alec Baldwin is pitching woo toward her continually yearning to tie the knot. But theres another issue I suppose. In all this perfection one thing is imperfect. Thats young Conrad who misses (or mourns) his father a pathology all the more powerful for not being openly stated. He mistrusts the father replacement figure Quinn and therefore acts out. You know hell destroy the house before the open house can happen his mom will lose her job and be forced to marry the petrochemical product Quinn and he will be sent away to a military academy which isnt called but should be ""Obergruppenfuehrer Nietzsches Dungeon of Discipline for Boys Who Are Very Bad."" What a perfect delineation of childhood yours mine and ours You know its wrong. You do it anyway. Youre a kid. So the two children are alone (the babysitter Mrs. Kwan has fallen asleep) trying to be good trying not to do what their worst natures mandate and of course its raining when enter stage left . . . Well what the hell is this thing? No its not Dr. Seusss Cat in the Hat. Its Mike Myerss Cat in the Hat which seems to be constructed of equal parts Linda (""Im verklempt. Talk amongst yourselves"") Richman and that other famous movie man in a cat suit Bert Lahr in ""The Wizard of Oz."" That is to say hes got the voice of Ms. Richman and the body language and weirdly ironic self-mocking laugh of the Cowardly Lion. But who really is the Cat in the Hat? Does he stand for childish anarchy and rebellion the urge to make messes and run away? Does he stand in some way for infant sexuality? When he releases his minions Thing 1 and Thing 2 from a locked crate is he liberating the ego and superego? (One expert ""The hat obviously is a phallic symbol."") But wait. I know. I think . . . hes a cat. And hes in a hat. So the cat tempts the kids. He charms them with juggling tricks he has magic ways of appearing and disappearing he lures them toward destruction without consequence. Do this do that. Have fun. Kick butt dont take prisoners play that funky music white kids. Meanwhile a fish (the voice is again Sean Hayess) warns them to behave. (""The fish"" one scribe notes earnestly ""is clearly a Christ figure."") Soon the Cat has got them in open rebellion against the tattletale neighbor Quinn and theyre off on a chase to recover the key to the crate out of which popped the two house destroyers Thing 1 and Thing 2. The business of the ""quest"" for the lock to the crate is awfully thin; nobody could come up with a better armature to get the whole crew out of the house? The director Bo Welch is a former production designer (of ""Men in Black"" I and II to name a few of his hit films) and so in some ways the film seems more production-designed than directed. Sometimes the design works sometimes it doesnt. It works alas least well when it should work most well. This is in the movies climax in which the mess that Thing 1 and Thing 2 (in themselves not gripping movie illusions) render unto Moms perfect house is supposed to be the mother of all messes a mess so biblical in scope that it encompasses all the schools of art and architecture an eighth-plague-upon-the-Egyptians kind of mess. But it looks more like an Ocean City miniature golf course after a hurricane had dumped it in the Fun Fair roller coaster. Its just sort of a mess worth a few seconds of film at 11 but not a lead story. The best thing in the film is the fabulous state of Dakota which is always pitch perfect and when shes not at the center of the movie you miss her. The second best thing is the fabulous Hayes. The third best is the volcanic Baldwin spewing a lava of hot grease and insinuation wherever he minces. Myers is funny but he doesnt quite pop madly like youd want him to. And that fish? What a drip. The Cat in the Hat (78 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild violence and crude double-entendres.

The younger the viewers the better reactions are bound to be while grownups will sit in varying states of bemusement. Although the pressure on the filmmakers to be inventive is palpable ""Dr. Seuss The Cat in the Hat"" is at least more appetizing than the ""Grinch"" a monstrous concoction that was nonetheless a monster at the box office. Attractively designed energetically performed and above all blessedly concise this adaptation of one of the most popular American kids books of all time walks the safe side of surrealism with its fur-flying shenanigans. The younger the viewers the better reactions are bound to be while grownups will sit still in varying states of bemusement and discomfiture. Jumbo holiday B.O. is a given as are massive profits in merchandising and ancillary. The only clouds likely to blight the cats ride to riches lie overseas where Dr. Seuss is little known if at all a fact borne out by the commercial history of Imagine and Universals ""Grinch."" Domestically Ron Howards Jim Carrey starrer was the biggest grosser of 2000 pulling down 260 million in holiday bounty. Total for the rest of the world however was only 80 million a sum foreign distrib DreamWorks will no doubt endeavor to improve upon but which still suggests offshore resistance to Yank-style kiddy fare and holiday-themed attractions -- not to mention an expression of good taste. Just as was the case with the story of the green hermit who hated Christmas Theodor S. Geisels short 1957 tale about a six-foot cat who disrupts and enlivens the lives of a brother and sister on a rainy day required considerable expansion to flesh it out to feature length even in a film as short as this one. (Pics running time sans end credits is all of 75 minutes no doubt a recent record for brevity in a live-action studio release.) Former ""Seinfeld"" scripters Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer bring the same aggressively antic approach to this job as they did to ""Grinch"" which means the films Gatling gun-spewed gags and low-batting-average joke-making unflaggingly flirts with adult tolerance levels. For an alleged comedy ""Cat"" pulls few real laughs out of its hat but does have the effect of putting the viewer into a state of low-level stupefaction a condition that can cut either way depending upon ones mental and physical constitution. Bug-eyed kids will likely not want to blink for fear of missing a split-second of the wonderment in the cats repertoire. By contrast adults who arent too put off will watch with admiring interest as Mike Myers adroitly channels approximately two parts Nathan Lane to one part each Bert Lahr and ""Top Cat."" First-time director Bo Welchs estimable background as the production designer of ""Edward Scissorhands"" among many other films comes to the fore with the immediate revelation of Anville as a cookie-cutter suburban world outfitted with an idealized 50s downtown identical lilac houses green interiors and likewise lime Ford Focuses in every driveway. In fact the color-coordinated pastels and elaborately worked out combination of locations sets and computer-generated visuals provide a soothing backdrop to the center-stage circus that could only have been more in-your-face had it been in 3-D. Fleshing out a character seen as only a pair of legs in the Seuss story Kelly Preston is the Mom with a clean-freak martinet boss (Sean Hayes) and a noxious boyfriend (Alec Baldwin) whose simple command to her two kids as she heads to her real estate office is to keep the house spotless since shes hosting a company party that night. Edict is no problem for daughter Sally (Dakota Fanning) a little blond neatnik who at one point complains ""I want more rules"" By contrast troublesome big brother Conrad (Spencer Breslin) is under threat of being sent to a military school if he doesnt shape up. Charged with supervising the moppets for the day is round narcoleptic babysitter Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) who falls asleep on arrival. Enter the Cat who after hanging up Mrs. Kwan in the closet starts his one-critter three-ring-circus act. A compulsive entertainer hell-bent on showing the kids how to have a good time without resorting to TV or videogames the New Yawk-accented feline enacts the trademark ball-balancing act from the book but to fill out the extra time must come up with a whole lot more like a Carmen Miranda musical number for starters. When that well runs dry after about 20 minutes out come Thing 1 and Thing 2 crazed acrobats who do exactly the opposite of what theyre told and go somersaulting off the sofas and walls and ceilings like hyperactive Teletubbies bent on total destruction. Pairs gravity-defying escapades rep some of the films liveliest moments. But theres limited mileage in this too so on the excuse of chasing the pet dog thats escaped the action moves outside in the Cats fantasmagorical vehicle which looks equally suited to land sea and outer space then back to the house for its final demolition before a quick clean-up by the Cats many-handed custodial machine the design teams best invention. Film adequately reflects the storys thematic interest in control vs. anarchy caution vs. letting go but never goes too far itself. Perhaps the one moment of genuine surrealism has Mrs. Kwan tuning in to watch a broadcast of the Taiwanese parliament which consists of a fistfight. Its an inspired but unfortunately lonely instance of genuine lunacy among the hundreds of similarly thrown-away gags -- one which will sail unnoticed past most viewers eyes. Its the sort of gag Robin Williams in his prime would have appreciated and no doubt run with prompting the thought that at his insane free-associating best Williams doing 20 minutes of in-character riffing would have been the greatest possible ""adaptation"" of ""The Cat in the Hat."" Myers extremely showbizzy ""lets-put-on-a-show"" characterization is amiable and has its moments but operates too consistently at a high pitch lacks a subversive undercurrent and is marred by too much laughing at his own jokes. Other perfs are broadly drawn to say the least and while the kids mostly get to stand around gawking at their guests hijinks Fanning once again proves her skill as a precocious little actress of sharp timing and instincts. Production values from the highly coordinated production and costume design lensing effects and cat grooming are all that money can buy.

The Cats snazzy look may be enough to make the movie a box office hit. Universal Studios Note that we didnt say funnier. Just furrier. Even the hairy-chested wannabe-ladies-man Austin Powers wasnt such an attraction as the feline star of this cinematic hairball. Like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas an earlier holiday seasons Dr. Seuss adaptation The Cat in the Hat is long on visual dazzle but short on warmth and the humor is excessively raunchy for a family film. But also like The Grinch The Cats snazzy look may be enough to make the movie a box office hit. Both prove theres more to adapting Seuss to the screen than just production design and casting a big-name comedian as the star. Seuss books are deceptively simple. The rhyming scheme belies depth cleverness and a slightly off-center sweetness. More about the movie The Cat in the Hat  stars out of four Stars Mike Myers Dakota Fanning Spencer Breslin Kelly Preston Director Bo Welch Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG for mild crude humor and some double-entendres Opens today nationwide Seuss is not cloying or didactic. Unfortunately the cinematic cat is both. He tries to bring together a dysfunctional family and correct the extremist behavior of the two children (Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning) rather than simply being the magical playmate he was in the book. Seuss stories value good sense and common decency. But the movie fashions forced conflicts (besides the visiting cats proclivity for really messy fun) and adds a couple of cartoonish villains with trendy weaknesses. The absentee mom (Kelly Preston) whos also given a greater presence in this padded version has a boss who is compulsively germ-phobic and in need of anger-management courses. Moms suitor (Alec Baldwin) is a belching beer-swilling phony do-nothing who masquerades as a sensitive and hard-working guy. With a nod to todays values filmmakers added a babysitter who unfortunately is the movies only major character of color. Shes also a clueless narcoleptic sycophant. And the house-centered story is expanded to scenes in the familys fantastical suburb. As silly as all the contrivances are the real disappointment is Myers human-size cat who is a fast-talking self-centered litigious annoyance instead of the nutty endearingly childlike fun-seeker he was on the page. Myers thick New York accent (with undertones of Bert Lahrs Cowardly Lion) would have been put to better use with funnier lines. He tends to sound like a Cat-skills comic on a bad day. When the kids exclaim in delighted surprise that their pet fish talks the cat snappily responds ""Yes but is it saying anything?"" Unfortunately this movie tries to say too much cluttering a simple but charming story with unnecessary babble excessive plot points and extraneous characters. And it omits a key element the books witty whimsical tone.

Film Title Dr. Seuss The Cat In The Hat. ... more Image 2 of 2 - - Photo HO Dr. Seuss contracts a serious case of cat-scratch fever 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Cat in the Hat Childrens comedy. Starring Mike Myers Alec Baldwin and Kelly Preston. Directed by Bo Welch. Written by Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer. (PG. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It is hard to say who is less recognizable in ""The Cat in the Hat"" Mike Myers or the actual Cat in the Hat. For the duration of the film Myers is encased in cat. He wears a tatty shag rug of a pelt that may faithfully follow the color scheme from the Dr. Seuss book but doesnt give off a hint of wonder or magic. He just looks like a guy in a cat suit -- which could use a brushing. Everything directs your attention to his face but because there is almost no range of expression available beneath the white rubber cat mask only Myers eyes have any life. It could be anybody in there. As for the Cat oh the places you will go. The Cat heaves into a barf bag twice (not including the dripping hairball he hacks up) cuts off his tail with a cleaver shows off a plumbers butt and in costume as a Carman Miranda character grabs and rubs both his ta-tas and his ha-has. It is an embarrassment and an insult to a character that has been beloved by kids for 45 years. Good thing Dr. Seuss is no longer with us. Hed take out his ""Bitsy Big Boy Boomeroo"" and blow this whole mess ""clear to Salamagoo."" (See ""The Butter Battle Book."") Frankly you can understand the problem. The wildly popular childrens book ""The Cat in the Hat"" is only 1620 words long. Once the filmmakers decided on the project they had two choices. They could carefully and artfully flesh out the existing framework to make a film. Or they could just throw in a whole bunch of wacky new characters and junk the story for some tasteless slapstick. Guess which one they picked? Maybe this will help. Confronted with a flaming toilet Myers Cat says ""That really burns my ass."" It is painful to watch these leaden mechanisms thud into place. Lets see one criticism of the book has always been that the two kids in the story Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning) were left home alone. So lets add a baby-sitter Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) who will show up and immediately fall into a coma-like sleep. Mom (Kelly Preston) is now a single parent who has a high-stress job and a slimy (literally by the end) neighbor (Alec Baldwin) who is attempting to trick her into marriage. Oh and Moms boss Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) is a screaming clean freak who could fire her any minute. Does any of this sound familiar? No? Good. Then you still remember the book. Dont bother to give the original a quick read before coming to the movie. The Cat has no sooner appeared at their house than he tells Conrad and Sally that hes ""not so great with the rhyming."" So forget all that clever Dr. Seuss verse kids. What else ya got? Those who do not know the book may think this is the story of an old vaudevillian in an animal suit who breaks into the kids house to tell raunchy jokes sing forgettable songs and crash around the set looking for laughs. That would have been a better movie -- if a real person only thought he was the Cat in the Hat. Then Myers could have worked his ""Austin Powers"" pee-pee and poop shtick and the legacy of ""The Cat in the Hat"" could have remained unscathed. Still you have to hand it to Myers. Even in a train wreck like this he still comes up with funny lines. They just have nothing to do with ""The Cat in the Hat."" At one point someone says events remind him of a circus. ""Yes"" Myers Cat says ""but without the tortured animals and drunken clowns that have hepatitis."" Good luck explaining that one to the kiddies. Myers does completely disappear into the role. It isnt just the full body costume. He does a mixture of two voices one of which is a note-for-note reading from Bert Lahr as the Cowardly Lion in ""The Wizard of Oz."" If there is such a thing as voice plagiarism the Lahr family should be on the phone to their attorneys pronto. The second takes a minute to get but it is Joe Pantoliano the star of the TV show ""The Handler"" and formerly the scummy Ralphie on ""The Sopranos."" Why Joey Pants would be a good choice for the Cats voice is a mystery but Myers does a great impression of him. Myers moony face bears a striking resemblance to the pointy features of ""The Grinch"" the 2000 holiday blockbuster whose success Universal Studios is desperately hoping to duplicate. But this is yet another example of a group of smug adults telling kids what they like. You love potty humor they say. You giggle when the Cat says not to listen to the fish because ""he drinks where he pees."" You will think it is hilarious when we insert a blatant plug for the Universal Studios tour in the middle of the movie. Youll want all that sexual innuendo and a PG rating even though the recommended reading age for the book is 4 to 8 years old. Actually no kids dont. They love the real ""The Cat in the Hat"" which has been among the top 10 best-sellers for children since 1957. They are fascinated by the Cat horrified that he trashes the house and delighted by the wordplay and rhymes. It is a story that has been a success without threats of sending Conrad to a military boarding school or bosses who screech at your mother. Or as a matter of fact any adults at all. See thats the real moral here. People think it is the Cat in the Hat who messes everything up. But thats not true. It is the grown-ups. As usual. -- Advisory Crude humor and sexually suggestive situations. Todays Deals Columbia Mens Palmerston Peak Water Shorts for 15 + free...

Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Mike Myers Review Movies Dr. Seuss or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""Dr. Seuss The Cat In The Hat"" is an eye-popping visual experience but its a struggle turning a thin wisp of a book -- just 223 words -- into an 84-minute movie that can hold the attention of anyone over the age of 5 or 6. Mike Myers is great in the title role but even this master of physical comedy struggles mightily to fill out this one-dimensional character. ""The Cat In The Hat"" boasts the same production team who brought us ""Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" but there was a whole lot more to that books story. The best thing about this production is the scenic design -- not surprising as this is the directorial debut of Bo Welch the production designer on such movies as ""Men In Black"" and ""Edward Scissorhands."" Since there was little actual story provided by Theodor S. Geisel (a.k.a. Dr. Seuss) the filmmakers had to invent one. After all the 1957 book was just supposed to be a primer for first-graders using a handful of vocabulary words -- not a compelling piece of fiction. Character sketches In the book you only see the Moms legs in the books illustrations. Kelly Preston who plays Mom in the film has a great set of gams but the character is fleshed out complete with a full body and a job as a real estate agent. The kids also get a baby sitter in the film played by Amy Hill. Sean Hayes makes an appearance as Moms germ-phobic boss Mr. Humberfloob and the plot involves Mom throwing the companys annual holiday party at her home. Alec Baldwin also has a supporting role as the familys sleazy neighbor who has designs on the Prestons character. As in the book the children (along with the Cat) are the principal characters. Spencer Breslin plays Conrad who constantly breaks the rules; Dakota Fanning plays his sister Sally a total control freak and Little Miss Goody Two Shoes. They both need a lesson or two about having fun and the Cat is determined to guide them into mayhem. Disasters and lessons The films production design is eye-catching but there isnt much there there. The best part of the film is the talking goldfish (voiced by Hayes) who delivers some of the classic lines from the book. Hes the voice of reason when Mom is suddenly called into work and sharply warns the kids not to mess up the house before the big party. The moment she leaves the baby-sitter falls asleep -- and the Cat shows up out of the blue. After numerous disasters orchestrated by the Cat involving tons of purple goo the house is completely destroyed. And thats pretty much it. Not much for a movie. In the end the kids learn their lessons Sally lets go of control and learns how to be spontaneous and Conrad discovers the importance of following rules. Great lessons for a 5- or 6-year-old. Come to think of it those are good lessons for Saddam Hussein; a pity Dr. Seuss probably wasnt too big in Iraq in the 50s. But I digress. As a film ""The Cat in the Hat"" isnt much really. Its perfect for parents looking for harmless entertainment to keep the young ones engaged during the holidays but less than perfect for anyone else. ""Dr. Seuss The Cat In The Hat"" opens nationwide on Friday November 21 and is rated PG.

"Mike Myers sinks his claws into Seuss. Slate Sign In Sign Up Mike Myers sinks his claws into Seuss. Mike Myers sinks his claws into Seuss. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 20 2003 655 PM This Cats a Dog Mike Myers sinks his claws into Seuss. By David Edelstein A smelly Cat If youve ever read a book by Dr. Seuss out loud you know theres nothing like having those long serpentine nonsense words flying out of your mouth on their own current Your voice seems to rise and fall on waves of anapestic tetrameter. On the other hand watching the new mega-budget Mike Myers vehicle Dr. Seuss TheCat in the Hat (Universal) is like being run over by a garbage truck that backs up and dumps its load on top of you. Its a sloppy and vulgar burlesque one of the most repulsive kiddie movies ever made. ""Vulgar"" sounds prudish so its important to add that when Dr. Seuss (born Theodore Geisel) began writing his books for children more than half a century ago they were a frisky antidote to the Dick and Jane school of moral hygiene. In a universe in which parents compulsively reined in their kids (sometimes for their kids own good more often for the good of their furniture and upholstery) his Cat in the Hat gave permission for frenzied destruction--destruction that could even discomfit the kids themselves whod inevitably internalized some of their parents edgy materialism. In their biography Dr. Seuss and Mr. Geisel Judith and Neil Morgan quote Maurice Sendak ""[Geisel] wrote great big noisy books with noisy pictures and noisy language. ... He was a bull in a china shop. ... He appealed to the animalistic nature of children."" Dr. Seuss never had his own kids which I think kept him pure Many of us zanies dont discover our Inner Repressive Parent until were worn down by children screaming in our ears spilling stuff on things we care about and toddling toward staircases like little suicide machines. Advertisement Sendak might have framed his Seuss assessment like that because noisy animalistic kids are at the heart of his own classic Where the Wild Things Are. In the books of Dr. Seuss theres actually something more than liberating anarchism Theres high elegance. The title character of The Cat in the Hat is a force of disorder but hes disorder in a top hat bow tie and white gloves--the daintiest most radiantly serene of tornados. The miracle of the Seussian universe is its balance between chaos and formality--that its whirligig cacophony arrives in all those gorgeously meticulous stanzas. What Myers and director Bo Welch and a battery of screenwriters have done is turn The Cat in the Hat into Austin Powers with fur balls. Its now a low-camp universe in which a vaguely 1950s conformity is undermined by scatological humor--belch and fart gags plus sniggery allusions to four-letter words and castration. The movie is aggressively unpleasant The music is grating and the colors garishly ugly--pea-soup green and egg-yolk yellow mixed with pink and lilac. Director Welch is a production designer who did playfully surreal work with Tim Burton on Beetlejuice (1988) and Edward Scissorhands (1990) but he doesnt want to move the camera and he keeps the action in the center of the frame where it congeals. The audience spends the first 15 minutes praying for the arrival of Myers then the next hour praying for an anvil to fall on his head. Myers doesnt have the lean silhouette of Dr. Seuss cat. Physically hes closer to Bert Lahrs Cowardly Lion and his voice is Lahrs with a dash of Cawffee Tawk Long Island The person he really sounds like is Joanne Worley from Laugh-In. He works like mad to bring The Cat in the Hat to life He prances around those inert frames; he even throws in a Saturday Night Live-style mock infomercial that ends with his tail being inadvertently whacked off. You can see the logic behind this gross-out sketch-comedy approach but its alien to Dr. Seuss--and more important its third-rate Myers. With his genius comic radar Myers must have sensed the slant was wrong but couldnt turn back. Even under all that hair you can detect the expression of someone flapping his arms to keep a lead balloon aloft. The movie comes with icky life lessons for the kids in the Cats charge Sally (Dakota Fanning) and Conrad (Spencer Breslin). The Cat has come to loosen up Sally and harness the creative energy of Conrad who has run afoul of his single moms suitor a conniving sharpie named Quinn (Alec Baldwin). Quinn is the bad repressive surrogate dad who wants to send Conrad to military school; the Cat is the good liberating surrogate dad who wants him to care. But its hard to concentrate on the struggle when both dads are so revolting. The movies grim subtext is the wreck of Baldwins career--how puffy he looks and how he never manages to rise above his material. Sean Hayes of Will amp; Grace gives not one but two disgraceful performances as the twitty boss of the kids pert blond mom (Kelly Preston) and the voice of a computer-generated killjoy goldfish. I cant make up my mind which is worse. Maybe the goldfish He actually has some verses of Seuss which Hayes rushes through impatiently to get to the potty jokes. The kids especially Fanning stay recognizably human and theres some imagination in the scene in which the Cat and his antic Things One and Two finally clean the house up with their impossible clackety cleaning machines. But it might be that the scene is so enlivening because we know it means the movie is almost over. Geisel swore off movies after a bad experience collaborating on The 5000 Fingersof Dr. T (1953) but softened toward Hollywood after lively cartoons by Chuck Jones and an evocative treatment of The Lorax. But now a dozen years after his death after the bloated pointless How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) and this latest desecration its clear that his heirs have sold out the good doctors legacy. What could be next Adam Sandler in Horton Hears a Poo? David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Cat in the Hat The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cat-in-the-hat-the ) Cat in the Hat The (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli There is an almost overpowering desire to write this review in the style of Dr. Seuss but I will resist it - primarily because the end product is more Mike Myers and overblown production design than it is the clever text of one of the most beloved of all childrens books. Because The Cat in the Hat is only 70-something pages long (with very LARGE print) it stands to reason that to make it into a movie a lot has to be added and its mostly in the padding that the movie fails to stand up. As a 30-minute short this might have been a lot of fun. But as an 82-mintue feature it seems painfully dragged out. Younger children probably wont mind but parents will be keenly aware that longer isnt necessarily better. The Cat in the Hat exists because of the success of the recent How the Grinch Stole Christmas. The earlier production directed by Ron Howard (who has a slightly more impressive resume than Bo Welch a production designer making his directorial debut) is noticeably better for a couple of reasons. The story is stronger (The Cat in the Hat to be frank doesnt have much in the way of a story) and the Christmas motif allows it to be tied to a holiday. The Cat in the Hat is being released around Thanksgiving but it takes place during the summer. Then there are the obvious similarities. Both movies feature impressive exaggerated production design. Both movies have a big-name comedian dressed up as a fictional creature. And both movies suffer greatly when the story relies on the innovations of the screenwriters instead of Dr. Seuss original material. The movie takes place in the fictionalized town of Anville where all of the houses are pink the lawns are neatly groomed and the shrubs look (intentionally) plastic. Mom (Kelly Preston) is on her way out for the afternoon leaving her two children control freak Sally (Dakota Fanning) and rules-breaker Conrad (Spencer Breslin) in the care of a babysitter. No sooner is she out the door than the babysitter falls asleep and the fun begins with the unexpected arrival of the Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers) a six-foot tall feline with a penchant for mischief. It doesnt take long for him (with help from Thing One Thing Two Sally and Conrad) to make a mess of the house before turning his attention to the outside world. Meanwhile Moms seedy boyfriend Quinn (Alec Baldwin) watches all of this with an eye to turning circumstances to his own advantage. There are two and only two noteworthy things about The Cat in the Hat. Its visually impressive and Mike Myers has a field day. Other than that the movie is entirely forgettable. Myers is like a live-action analog of Robin Williams animated genie in Aladdin. Hes always doing something odd often employing a voice imitation and/or a costume change. Myers is fun for a short period but after a while even his high-energy approach starts to wear thin. For the most part however he manages not to be upstaged by the garish set design which places rotary phones alongside palm pilots and lets colors run riot. The Cat in the Hat looks like a childrens book come to life which is of course the intention. Myers sprinkles in some ""mature"" humor to provide a few laughs for the older folk in the audience but it barely keeps the tedium at bay. For those who have crossed over the puberty line the amusement value of The Cat in the Hat can be viewed on a sliding scale. Its moderately engaging for the first half-hour somewhat trying during the second half hour and virtually unbearable over the final twenty minutes. Its a marginally recommendable film for kids but not necessarily for parents. And since this is a surprisingly family friendly time at the box office why not see something that entertains equally across the age spectrum rather than a high profile movie with a narrow range of appeal?
