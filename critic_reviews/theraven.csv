John Cusack as Poe works to try and stop the madman. In theaters April 27 2012. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Edgar Allan Poe discovers that his gruesome fiction has inspired a real-life fan. BOTTOM LINE Suitably icky entertainment brightened a bit by Cusack as a wry-humored Poe. CAST John Cusack Alice Eve Luke Evans. WHEN/WHERE Area theaters LENGTH 150 Long before network television began serving up mangled cadavers for our entertainment there were the stories of Edgar Allan Poe nasty little mysteries about sick-minded murderers and their victims. Its surprising it took so long for someone to concoct ""The Raven"" a thriller in which Poes fiction inspires a real-life copycat killer. ""The Raven"" is slightly gorier than a prime-time procedural though no more inventive -- call it ""CSI Baltimore 1849"" -- but its at least as entertaining. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""The Raven"" wont do much to change the common perception of Poe as a sick-souled alcoholic though John Cusack a counterintuitive choice for the role plays him with a twinkle of humor and a springy energy. Cusacks still-boyish charm alleviates the fog and lamplight that director James McTiegue keeps pumping in and it helps convince us that a sunny-faced beauty like Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) could fall for the author of such unhealthy stories as ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" When that and other Poe fictions begin coming to life Detective Fields (a solid Luke Evans) briefly considers Poe a suspect but Emilys disappearance rules that out. (The scenes of her begging for her life are a little too intense even for this macabre film.) Soon the unknown killer is not only taunting the police but demanding that Poe publish a new story based on each murder. (What not a single joke about ""deadlines""?) The intersection of art and life is a concept too heady for ""The Raven"" which is basically a well-researched but formulaic mystery centered on one of those nyah-nyah serial killers weve seen a thousand times. (The movie owes a secret debt to 1979s underrated ""Time After Time"" in which H.G. Wells tracks Jack the Ripper.) What imagination ""The Raven"" has comes from the mind of Poe himself. Its a testament to the author that he can still make even modern stomachs lurch.

"Tell-tale signs of a flaccid movie afflict The Raven |       NJ.com comments Tell-tale signs of a flaccid movie afflict The Raven Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 27 2012 at 820 AM View/Post Comments Larry Horricks/Amontillado ProductionsJohn Cusack and Samuel Hazeldine in ""The Raven."" During the whole of a dull dark and soundless day in the springtime of the year when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens I had been passing alone through a particularly dreary stretch of midtown when I fearfully decided to pay a call upon the House of Screenings. I suffer you see from a peculiar derangement. What some may call a bright color I find garish; what others nod at as pleasing music I shrink from as discordant. Fault I find with everything snarling at the prettiest of players fleeing theaters with my hands clapped over my eyes. I am I confess a critic. So of course was Edgar Allan Poe and a rather vituperative one. As well as being one of the great dark geniuses of American literature a singular talent who created a nightmare world of hidden desires consumptive brides loathsome putrescence and endless melancholy. So it was with some trepidation that I entered this particular picture show expecting to see the tortured poet transformed into some callow matinee idol with pomaded hair and violet-scented handkerchiefs. But ""The Raven"" is truer than that. Its Poe is a mostly drunken reprobate who sobers up only when he realizes theres a murderer rampaging through Baltimore. A murderer who has taken his ideas -- razor-sharp pendulums premature burials -- from Poes tales. And then takes Poes love too and threatens to slaughter her unless Poe creator of the detective tale solves this real mystery. There is a danger here of wandering into the steampunk pop-junk territory of the recent ""Sherlock Holmes"" with Poe suddenly a master of fisticuffs and fencing swinging from chandeliers while firing off fanciful Victorian weapons. To its great credit ""The Raven"" avoids that. John Cusack makes a realistic nicely sardonic and properly pasty-looking Poe. He holds a gun precisely twice during the film; once he drops it and the second time he fires and misses. Repeatedly. (Perhaps this is the true reason the man was drummed out of West Point.) Unfortunately the characterization is far more accurate than the rest of the movie which tries to pass off Belgrade and Budapest as Baltimore litters the dialogue with anachronisms and has someone offhandedly discussing novels that Jules Verne had yet to publish. These are small indignities; more grievous is the films lack of dramatic tension. It lingers intolerably on some inessential scenes rushes through others and fails to provide any motivation either for Poes devoted (albeit fictional) love or the films archvillain. Most of the players remain almost defiantly uncharismatic. Not so Cusack at least whose performance as the dissolute genius is fierce and full-blooded. Hes a lovely Gothic sight sweeping down those cobblestone streets in his cape; theres real bite and brio to his attacks on ""hacks"" like Emerson and Longfellow. (As I said as a critic Poe was nothing if not unsparing.) Which is why dear reader I fear he himself would not spare this rather thick-fingered attempt at re-creating the delicate frissons of his tales -- and immediately secrete it if not beneath some worm-eaten floorboards then at least deep within the middle of your Netflix queue. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and drug and alcohol abuse. The Raven (R) Relativity (111 min.) Directed by James McTeigue. With John Cusack Alice Eve Luke Evans.

Set in Baltimore in 1849 this lurid and ludicrous mystery has author Edgar Allan Poe summoned to assist police when a serial killer starts committing murders based on his stories. The macabre writer rapidly disintegrating in the final weeks of his gloomy life penniless and pulling the ""Dont you know who I am?"" routine in taverns for free drinks is portrayed here as having a pet raccoon and ongoing feuds with all of his literary colleagues. And then you know he fights crime. In other words its exactly the kind of preposterousness that could benefit from one of Cages trademark over-the-top nutty performances. Instead of Nicolas Cage (Christopher Walken would have been good too) we have John Cusack who is beloved by one and all but who seems to be taking this nonsense seriously. Somehow he read the screenplay (credited to Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare []) and thought Ah yes. Here is something meaty into which I can sink my thespian teeth. There are moments when hes almost as outrageous as the material calls for -- say when Poe is pursuing the killer across a catwalk above a stage where a production of Macbeth is in mid-performance -- but in general he is frustratingly subdued. The same is also true of the director James McTeigue. After V for Vendetta which was flamboyant but smart he made Ninja Assassin which was loud and stupid. Now hes mixing the two The Raven has bursts of tasteless gratuitous Saw-style violence but McTeigue never commits to the kind of full-bore lunacy that might have made the film a campy pleasure. Hes splitting the difference between respectability and fun trashiness and it doesnt work. You gotta choose a side. We dont even get a decent mystery plot The police represented by Detective Fields (Orlando Bloom impersonator Luke Evans) initially suspect Poe himself of the murders. The wealthy young woman Poe is wooing (played by Alice Eve) must eventually fall into the clutches of the killer of course. Her father (Brendan Gleeson) disapproves of her relationship with Poe. The killer leaves notes instructing Poe to write about the murders in the newspaper lest he strike again which he does anyway. The killers identity becomes apparent in a most ham-fisted manner and is completely implausible. So what kept me from hating the film altogether? Those occasional moments of intended humor as when Poe remarks ""If I had known my work would have such an influence on people Id have devoted more time to eroticism""; and the moments of unintended humor which are much more frequent. Basically I laughed at the film a lot but not enough to make it worthwhile as an all-out train wreck.

Edgar Allen Poe ... the action hero? In the world of ""The Raven"" anything is possible. The movie imagines one of Americas greatest literary geniuses as a dashing deeply conflicted writer caught in a series of maddening events shortly before his mysterious death. The idea is a ripe one fictionalizing Poes last days as an alcoholic pauper on the streets of Baltimore where he was found delirious on Oct. 3 1849 before expiring in a hospital four days later. The subject matter screams out for cleverness and depth the sort of mind-bending twists and satisfying darkness that Poe himself would love. It finds them only in small doses. John Cusack plays an accessible Hollywood-friendly Poe a desperate widower who gets by on his wit and humor. The grim miserable countenance of Poe we see on book jackets isnt emphasized here. Instead we have Poe the charming penniless rogue and boozer who argues with barkeeps over his tab despite being an internationally beloved writer. Cusack is saddled with a jet-black beard and omnipresently bulbous overcoat but he manages to bring an inherent likability to the role. Hes rewarded with some fun tongue-twisting dialogue that Poe fans will no doubt appreciate. But a lurching plot and indecisive tone prevent him from ever rising above a slight portrayal. Director James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta"") sidesteps the Quentin Tarantino-meets-Terry Gilliam glee of Guy Ritchies recent ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies for a more muted palette painting Baltimore as a dreary burgh with splashes of orange flame and crimson blood. Poes clashes with barkeeps and his newspaper staff are contrasted with a deepening murder mystery which is investigated by the square-jawed Detective Fields (up-and-comer Luke Evans). Someone is kidnapping citizens and killing them in the manner of Poes short stories taunting him with clues in a presumed play for an audience with Poe. There are a few gory torture-porn scenes that never feel particularly dark or grimy and some moments with the shadowy antagonist that feel ripped from every serial-killer movie since ""The Silence of the Lambs."" In fact ""The Raven"" seems content to present flashes of other films and genres without committing to any of them whether its mining the rhythm of a police procedural or channeling Tim Burtons gothic fetishes. Cusack never finds much chemistry with his love Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve the only appreciable female character here). And despite all his breathless running around and ""aha"" moments hes never given a satisfying fistfight or fully fleshed action sequence even as McTeigue seems eager to frame and pace many scenes that way. So is it a story worthy of Poe? Hardly. Like the title bird that hangs around Poe during moments of portent the filmmakers didnt seem to know quite what to do with him so they merely reference his spirit instead of summoning and integrating it fully into the movie. Poes brilliant stories are reduced to occasions for Rube Goldberg contraptions and hokey improbable calling cards. Poe-philes will have fun spotting the references to individual stories and lines. And newbies may be sufficiently intrigued as to seek out Poes work -- which is the greatest service this middling thriller could provide.

The film casts a wan-looking John Cusack as the morbid scribbler and thrusts him into a plot involving a deranged fan drawing bloody inspiration from ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" and ""The Mystery of Marie Roget."" Sickly hungover Poe makes a bumbling sleuth and his official sidekick Detective Fields (Luke Evans strenuously overacting) is no better. The pair arrive at every atrocity just a beat too late. As the wimpy writers gorgeous highborn lover Alice Eve is even more unbelievable than the plot. As her father a Baltimore potentate Brendan Gleeson thunders to little effect. Director James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta"") has no feel for humor or terror making what could have been a witty pastiche into another cheesy slice-and-dice horror flick. 1/2 out of four stars Rated R for bloody violence and grisly images.

He stars as Gianni a trim retiree who treads lightly around his wife and daughter treating his home as a bed-and-board arrangement hes loath to disrupt. Hes long suffering with his wealthy widowed mama who is squandering his inheritance but on his own hes a would-be Lothario drawn to every dazzling beauty he meets. His fruitless efforts to consummate one last fling before he calcifies into an untouchable old duffer is understandable poignant and irresistibly silly. When a friend feeds Gianni a pep pill and sends him off to the red-light district his flustered attempts to navigate Romes notorious traffic is a hoot. The film plays like a postscript to Truffauts domestic comedies as Gianni age notwithstanding continues to wrestle with selfish immaturity and emotional impulsiveness.

RottenTomatoes.com read reviews SAFE A slow-building B-movie thriller the plot is nothing new for star Jason Statham. Theres a girl in need of his protection from assorted gangs of bad men. But the dialogue crackles with flinty one-liners. What we have here is basically an American ""Transporter"" with Statham caught up in the most jaw-dropping quick-cut fights youve seen in years. He plows through Russians on the subway Chinese gangsters in a casino and cops in between on the mean streets which he navigates with dazzling automotive dexterity. Occasionally he stops long enough to make a threat. The dialogue and the characters are better than the plot. And the fights are better than even the one-liners. Statham never phones it in though his roles can seem to be one long version of the same guy haunted and hunted in need of a shave. -ROGER MOORE MCCLATCHY NEWS SERVICE  1/2 out of four stars Rated R for strong violence throughout and for language.

Seansaid on Wednesday May 02 2012 51242 PMRichard I would like to start off by saying that 9 times out of 10 I tend to agree with your film reviews. Sadly I have to to say here that this is that one time out of ten No offense Rich but did you smoke a tremendous amount of crack cocaine before you viewed this over-wrought cliche-ridden BORING piece of crap? I mean honestly you didnt even bother to mention the downright AWFUL acting of actress Alice Eve whos performance was so self-consciously terrible that it doesnt even count as being ""campy."" Now normally if I disagree with a critics review of a film regardless of whether I loved it and they hated it or vice-versa (as in this case) I would notfeel compelled to write a comment. This B+ rating however is so incredibly BAFFALING to me that something MUST be said lest naive moviegoers see your review and make the same mistake I did spending any money on this garbage. Regarding why the film for lack of a better or more perfect word SUCKS aside from the horrendous performance of ALL the actors (yes including Cusack who I usually enjoy and ESPECIALLY Alice Eve) first of all I felt like the director (who I refuse to call ""filmmaker"" as that implies an actual artist as opposed to a perfunctory studio appointed hack) tried desperately to rip off the movie ""From Hell"" in terms of gothic 19th century ambiance. What resulted was a hackneyed attempt filled to the brim with cliches. Aside from the highly implausible plot which was so uninteresting that I literally couldnt care less who the killer was the move was just plain BORING Come to think of it I may not even be entirely qualified to write this scathing review SINCE I FELL ASLEEP FOR ABOUT 15 TO 20 MINUTES Now mind you I havent fell asleep in a movie theater since I was five years old. Im 25 now and I have seen some real snoozers so what does THAT tell you? Anyway I really could go on and on but I doubt you (Richard whom I still have ""mad respect"" for despite your misguided review) will even be the one reading this so I will stop ranting and say...SERIOUSLY???

"The Raven (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Raven (R) John Cusack gives his all in this flawed horror movie inspired by the life and work of Edgar Allan Poe. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/27/2012 Editor rating 2 For a good hour or so The Raven is gruesome ludicrous fun. Then its just ludicrous. This speculative work of horror takes the mysterious events surrounding the death of Edgar Allan Poe -- who died on Oct. 7 1849 of unknown causes after being found on the streets of Baltimore incoherent and delusional -- and melds them into a Seven-style mystery surrounding a serial killer using Poes stories (The Pit and the Pendulum The Masque of the Red Death and The Cask of Amontillado among them) as inspirations for a string of ghastly elaborate murders. ""This crime is familiar to me"" says Detective Fields (Luke Evans) while investigating the murder of a woman found dead inside a locked room with the only window nailed shut from the inside. Eventually he realizes the sight is familiar from one of the notorious stories written by Poe (John Cusack) who has been floating around town broke and often drunk begging barkeeps for credit and pitching fits of indignation at newspaper editors who censor his scathing reviews of the works of his competitors. Cusacks performance as Poe injects a shot of adrenaline to director James McTeigues carefully rendered but rather lifeless recreation of 19th century Baltimore. The actor plays Poe as a flask-swigging rapscallion constantly spouting self-aggrandizing boasts and declarations that mask his inner insecurities. Hes a jerk but an entertaining flamboyant one. You wouldnt want to hang around him but you dont mind watching his disruptive antics and Cusack lets us see how Poe feeds on the negative energy he creates the fuel to his self-destructive fire. As the film opens Poe is broke and in dire need of cash but questioning his own talents (""Ive got nothing left"" he mutters. ""Ive used up all my tricks."") Hes madly in love with the beautiful Emily (Alice Eve) but her wealthy father (Brendan Gleeson) disapproves of her notorious suitor so they keep their affair a secret. Then the murders begin Zodiac-style with the killer leaving clues and notes aimed directly at Poe. Who is taunting the author and why? What does he want and how far will he go to get it? The Raven which was written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare with an obvious affection for Poes work is engaging in a goofy artificial way as long as the murder investigation remains in the background and Poe commands our attention. Cusack is primarily known as a gifted comedian but hes equally good at roles that require him to reveal glimpses of his inner darkness (The Grifters The Ice Harvest Money for Nothing). Those are the parts he takes between paycheck roles. Unfortunately McTeigue (who directed V for Vendetta and Ninja Assassin) is more comfortable with pyrotechnics and flash than angst and brooding. The longer The Raven goes on the less use the film has for Cusack who visibly checks out of the picture once hes reduced to running around frantically playing Sherlock Holmes. By the time bullet time special effects a la The Matrix pop up The Raven has drifted away into the land of brain-dead sensationalism and dunderheaded story knots. Poe for one would have screamed murder. Cast John Cusack Alice Eve Luke Evans Brendan Gleeson Kevin McNally. Director James McTeigue. Screenwriters Ben Livingston Hannah Shakespeare. Producers Marc D. Evans Trevor Macy Aaron Ryder. A Relativity Media release. Running time 111 minutes. Explicit violence graphic gore strong adult themes. Opens Friday April 27 at area theaters.

The incantatory language of Edgar Allan Poe as in his poem The Raven is touched and tortured by nightmares; it haunts itself as much as it does the reader. Poes fantastic fiction reads like fevered autobiography -- screams written in blood on torn bed sheets thrown from the high barred window of an institution for the brilliantly deranged. Since Poes death in 1849 he has been the patron saint of paranoia the poet laureate of the young lonely and morbidly romantic who see this world and the next as one seamless fearful pageant. ""The boundaries which divide Life from Death are at best shadowy and vague"" he wrote in ""The Premature Burial."" ""Who shall say where the one ends and where the other begins?"" The verse and short stories of ""the divine Edgar"" -- as Humbert Humbert calls him in Vladimir Nabokovs Lolita -- have inspired more movies than the works of any writer but Shakespeare. And because Poes writing reflects the psychic turmoil of his life (his marriage to his 13-year-old cousin Virginia who succumbed to consumption at the age of 20) and especially his own death (in Baltimore at 42 of ""congestion of the brain"" in a delirium whose single coherent word was the repeated name ""Reynolds"") the writer has often been a screen subject from D.W. Griffiths 1909 short Edgar Allan Poe to Francis Coppolas 3-D Gothic tale Twixt last year. Now he is the star character of the suitably creepy fitfully diverting The Raven. Directed by James McTeigue this faux biopic presses elements from a half-dozen Poe stories into the service of a modern serial-killer plot. (MORE Read TIMEs review of Francis Coppolas Poe-etic Twixt) When Edgar (John Cusack) isnt lurching across Baltimore like a shabby-genteel species of Poe white trash -- drunkenly picking fights with bartenders and newspaper editors -- he is courting Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) the healthy blond daughter of a choleric Army officer and burgher (Brendan Gleeson) who disapproves of their union. Poe though is not the craziest man in town. Someone has been committing gruesome murders of young women their manner of death similar to aspects of Poe stories a slaughter scene in a sealed room from ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" a slicing in half of Poes literary rival inspired by ""The Pit and the Pendulum."" Other assaults are elaborate restagings of ""The Masque of the Red Death"" ""The Tomb of Ligeia"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart."" Police Inspector Fields (Luke Evans) engages the author in the quest for the murderer while Poes paper stokes municipal panic with headlines about ""The Serial Killer."" ""Serial killer"" is both a dreadful and soothing concept horrifying in its revelation of the most diseased sadistic and cunning minds reassuring in attaching a series of atrocities to one lunatic. Serial-killer fiction pleases the audiences taste for sensation -- young women brutalized by a clever psychopath -- and its need to tie loose narrative strands into a carnographic denouement. The device has become a sprawling genre its possible there are more serial killers in novels and films than are documented in criminal files. But as Bill James writes in Popular Crime his quirky unputdownable survey of the most notorious American murders police as recently as 50 years ago ""did not believe in serial murders. The term serial murders did not exist....[E]xperienced policeman all knew that almost all real crimes were committed by persons who knew the victim."" (SEE The all-TIME Top 25 Horror Movies) Yes yes The Raven is only a movie. And Poe was a prime progenitor of detective fiction -- though rather than inspiring actual murder cases he took his cue from them. (""The Mystery of Marie Roget"" retold and attempted to solve the 1841 Manhattan killing of Mary Rogers; and Poes only play Politian was based on the Beauchamp-Stark case of a love affair murder and suicide in Kentucky in 1825.) The films screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare have a little fun fitting some particulars of Poes life and the more lurid aspects of his writing into a genre almost as prevalent as serial-killer stories ""faction"" which drops historical personalities into fanciful tales. (E.L. Doctorows Ragtime was the template but examples abound. The new movie The Pirates Band of Misfits makes free and irreverent use of Queen Victoria and Charles Darwin.) (MORE TIMEs review of The Pirates Band of Misfits) ""The death of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world"" Poe wrote in his essay ""The Philosophy of Composition"" (published six years after Virginias death and a year before his own). The movie pins Edgars bizarre temperament and his overuse of alcohol and opium on the loss of his child bride. ""Every woman he ever loved"" a friend of Poes says ""has died in his arms."" The role should be perfect for Cusack who set some unofficial record a few years back when he appeared in four consecutive films (The Contract Grace Is Gone 1408 and Martian Child) playing a man haunted by his dead wife or daughter. But the actor depends too much on the declamatory-hysteric mode for which he is poorly suited; hes better at withering whispered barbs often directed inward. Beset by ""the melancholy that has followed me like a black dog all my life"" Edgar should smolder not bluster. McTeigue the Australian protege of the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix) and director of the spiffy borderline-treasonous V for Vendetta slams home the period atmosphere; those dank Baltimore dens have an almost olfactory impact. He gets appealing performances from Evans Eve Gleeson Sam Hazeldine as Poes No. 1 fan at the newspaper and in the small role of a bartender Brendan Coyle cherished by PBS viewers as the valet John Bates on Downton Abbey. Until The Raven almost literally loses itself during a chase in the city sewers it nicely balances its literary gamesmanship with a R-rated thrillers mandatory gross-out tableaux. (MORE Read TIMEs review of James McTeigues V for Vendetta) But the movie remains a spectacle --  a coroners dispassionate report on a troubled soul -- rather than the anguished confession that is the hallmark of true Poe fiction. For first-hand banshee testimony go back to the stories and hear the voice of an artist who speaks to us not just from nearly 200 years ago but from beyond the grave or inside it.

"The Raven has Cusacks Poe swinging like a pendulum Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-RavenReview The Raven has Cusacks Poe swinging like a pendulumIn The Raven John Cusacks Edgar Allan Poe is alternately raving mad and soberly brilliant as he tracks a killer. If only the filmmakers could equal Poes prose.April 27 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) holds his fiancee Emily (Alice Eve)... (Larry Horricks Relativity...)""The Raven""stars John Cusack in a gothic thriller pulled from the tales of Edgar Allan Poe that regrettably falls prey to its grand and grisly ambitions a its neither grand nor grisly enough to seriously satisfy Poe-ish cravings for murder mystery and literary allusions.More pulp fiction than macabre masterpiece it is nevertheless a nifty idea screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare have concocted for director James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta""). Imagine a serial killer in 19th century Baltimore suddenly replicating Poes stories the murders mimicking those in ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" among others. Hes also leaving cryptic taunts behind for the writer that offer up a lethal game of cat and mouse. Will Poe play?The detective on the case one Emmett Fields (an excellent Luke Evans) has read and remembers enough of Poe to quickly make the connection. Soon hes enlisted the irascible alcoholic wordsmith to join him in sleuthing things out. Unfolding in Poes last days the film also tries to solve the riddle of the poets mysterious death at 40.Letting Poe watch his work come to horrific life is the conceit that drives the action. Hes not all that interested until fiancA(c)e Emily (Alice Eve) is snatched with the killer demanding more stories from Poe as a ransom essentially forcing him to spend the rest of the movie desperately writing his way out of a series of dilemmas. Oh that the screenwriters could have as well.Whats missing in the movie is the tightly constructed tension-building that Poe did so unsettlingly and inventively well. When one scene features Poe holding a reading for some of the citys bookish bunch it is a reminder of just how powerful his prose could be. ""The Raven"" in contrast has some momentary flourishes and a few harrowing moments but nothing to tie things together with all the fear and loathing that made the author such an original.What is both ambitious and grand is the films stylish look. McTeigue working with director of photography Danny Ruhlmann is only getting better at creating richly textured environments for his characters. Hes traded the futuristic London dystopia he mined in ""V for Vendetta"" for the dark cobblestone streets of Baltimore circa 1849 with Budapest and Belgrade subbing in.Veteran costume designer Carlo Poggioli (""Cold Mountain"") who worked with McTeigue on ""Vendetta"" does a bang-up job giving Poe something of an updated Shakespearean look with clothes that complement Cusacks goatee and have a kind of drama as Poe rushes from one crime scene to another. A costume ball hosted by Emilys father (Brendan Gleeson) is so wonderfully and darkly over the top it is almost worth the price of admission almost.""The Raven"" is a talky film filled with lots of rambling discourses for Cusack which the actor handles well enough. Its the mishmash of competing issues and emotions that the character is weighed down with that trips things up. Sometimes Poe is raving mad as the poet was said to be near the end of his short life and sometimes hes stone-cold sober putting his intellect to the task. But it all feels rather random. As for the romance Poes and the fiancA(c)es flirtations are as deadly as anything the killer serves up.The film is at its best when Det. Fields is on the case. Evans brings a crispness and focus to Fields that makes the ludicrous believable rather than laughable. Its not enough to solve all of ""The Ravens"" problems but it helps.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESKnotts offers a peek behind the scenes at three Halloween...September 13 2013Woe is Poe The TV show The Following loses its literary...January 22 2013Review Kevin Bacon helps make The Following worth...January 21 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTRavenSerial KillerEdgar Allan PoePendulumCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-the-raven-20120427,0,6284660.story?track=rss",200,theraven8,theraven,latimes

Photo Rogue Pictures/Everett Collecti But Im only a critic exclaims a victim whos about to be sliced up by a pendulum operated ax in ""The Raven a thriller that posits--more entertainingly than convincingly -- that Edgar Allan Poe spent the last five days of his life tracking down a serial killer inspired by his tales of terror. The death of said critic (John Warnaby)--who was engaged in a literary feud with our hero-- briefly casts suspicion on the drunken mildly disheveled Poe splendidly impersonated here by John Cusack (who if nothing else knows how to rock a cape). Assured by Poes boss that ""the only thing hes ever killed was a pint of gin the detective (Luke Evans) assigned to the case in 1849 Baltimore enlists the assistance of the drunken author. Poe is appalled that the fiend has already styled a pair of killings on ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue and has left a note at the scene of the latest crime promising a real life update on ""The Masque of the Red Death. Despite the best efforts of the Baltimore police force the anonymous fiend abducts Poes fiancee (Alice Eve) from a masked ball given by her muttonchopped father (the gleefully hamming Brendan Gleeson). The villain treats the fiancee to a premature burial in a coffin--as she hopefully awaits rescue by Poe. Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeares script borders on the silly and theres more than a bit of anachronistic dialogue (the term ""serial killer"" wasnt used until over a century later). And its a bit disappointing that the ultimately unmasked culprit turns out to basically be a 19th century fanboy trying to coax one more story from Poes hand. But in the skilled hands of Cusack--who recites quite a bit of Poes poetry -- and director John McTeigue (""V for Vendetta) its good pulpy fun with eye catching period trimmings and Hungarian locations standing in ably for 19th century Maryland. I must confess Im confused about exactly why ""The Raven ends with hardrocking ""Se7enstyle credits. But then what do I know? Im only a critic.

Starring John Cusak Luke Evans Alice Eve Brendan Gleeson Oliver Jackson-Cohen Director James McTeigue Running time 143 Release Opened Apr 27 2012  Editorial Review Once upon a movie drearyBy John DeForeFriday Apr. 27 2012See the right promotional photo of John Cusack playing Edgar Allan Poe in ""The Raven"" and it briefly looks like a good idea The high forehead the shadowed eyes - even with Poes moustache transformed into a more 2012-fashionable goatee theres enough of a resemblance to tantalize. If Hollywoods going to turn the author who invented detective fiction into a crime fighter himself perhaps this is our guy. But then Edgar Allan Poe walks into a bar and starts talking and we immediately understand why Cusack is not known for playing men who lived before 1984. Nothing in the actors cadence or attitude suggests he has changed much to blend in with the storys 1849 setting. But it isnt as if the movies screenplay by scribes Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare gives him any help Its unconvincing dialogue makes little attempt to capture Poes idiom something that would seem obligatory given Poes Gothic legacy. Like the recent Sherlock Holmes films ""The Raven"" seems content to steal a famous figures name and leave any stabs at authenticity to the set and costume designers. The movies conceit takes a tidbit of biographical fact - Poe died under mysterious conditions having been found on the streets in a state of delirium - and spins an action-film fantasy to fit it. Here the booze-weakened author helps hunt a serial killer he himself has inspired. After some grisly killings whose details come straight from Poes fiction Baltimore detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) goes to the author for help. Soon the killer is taunting Poe directly leaving clues for him at crime scenes and kidnapping the wealthy woman (Alice Eve) he hopes to marry. Although the trappings of each crime refer to Poes literature - a surprisingly graphic disembowelment-via-pendulum for instance - ""The Raven"" owes far more to such contemporary serial-killer films as ""Seven."" Viewers might find some novelty in trying to predict how ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" or ""The Premature Burial"" will work their way into the proceedings but imaginative ties to those classics are scarce here. Director James McTeigue was much more successful capturing graphic novelist Alan Moores mood in ""V for Vendetta"" than he is conjuring the bone-chilling suspense of Poe. But viewed as simply another Hollywood thriller ""The Raven"" builds up a decent head of steam as time runs out for our heros imperiled fiancee. All the while the bleary-eyed Poe is forced to write an ongoing chronicle of the investigation by the killer a fan who threatens more bloodshed if the stories dont live up to the authors inimitable classics. Heres hoping for the filmmakers sake that none of Poes contemporary fans are as murderously discriminating.Contains violence and surprisingly graphic gore.

Comments (6) click to enlarge The Raven Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Watch on Netflix Rated R  111 minutes  2012 Edgar Allan Poe invented the detective story so turning him into the heroic sleuth of a mystery thriller makes perfect sense and the much-debated circumstances of his death in October 1849 provide an ideal jumping-off point for this macabre entertainment. Screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare sketch in Poes alleged alcoholism and vicious spats with literary colleagues before the author (John Cusack) is recruited by a Baltimore police detective (Luke Evans) to help track down a serial killer whos riffing on Poes stories. This may conjure up unpleasant memories of Guy Ritchies Sherlock Holmes movies but Ritchie could learn a lot from director James McTeigue (V for Vendetta); this is multiplex fare to be sure but McTeigue manages to popularize 19th-century literature without completely vulgarizing it.

A serial killer/Gothic drama/love story hybrid it has some nicely mounted atmospheric scenes and strong acting from John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe. But it is dogged by a story that grows plodding.This is not the film adaptation of Poes famous poem but it does pay tribute to the writers prose and poetry. The film centers on stories he serialized in newspapers and is a yarn featuring the literary artist interlaced with his macabre work and a crime-thriller plot.STORY Real-life Poe mystery propels film The RavenA serial killer is loose in Baltimore in 1849 and the murders contain gruesome elements of the fiction of Poe whose work appears in the local newspaper. After being cleared as a suspect Poe assists a police detective (Luke Evans) and gets drawn deeper into the slayings when his fiancee Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped. Echoes of The Pit and the Pendulum The Murders in the Rue Morgue and lesser-known works are featured in the tale.Seemingly meant to elucidate Poes character and psyche the film does not achieve those goals. We see hes tortured and drinks excessively but are not given enough back story about how he got there. Nor does it shed light on the real-life mystery of his death. The implication is that Poe spent his final days working out the mystery of these slayings. His last words revealed the killers identity. Its fascinating if implausible.About the movieThe Raven1/2 out of fourStars John Cusack Alice Eve Brendan Gleeson Luke Evans Director James McTeigueDistributor Relativity Media Rating R for bloody violence and grisly images Running time 1 hour and 43 minutes Opens Friday nationwideStill its a moderately entertaining yarn that conjures up the era effectively through vivid period costumes and mostly Cusacks able rendering of the mercurial writer a social pariah in his day.Cusacks and Poes considerable talents however are given short shrift by a prosaic screenplay that flattens the considerable intrigue out of the characters life minimizes his verbal dexterity and has the characters occasionally speaking dialogue that sounds anachronistic to the era.At its core its a standard-issue police procedural/whodunit even if set in a more romantic era. The biographical elements are obscured by the grisly details of the murders. And most of the cast -- which includes some impressive British actors -- come off as stock characters.While much of the story feels hollow and the suspense loses momentum The Raven is worth seeing if only for Cusacks boozy turn as the odd bird writer.

People love the gory ones"" a newspaper editor tells Edgar Allan Poe (John Cusack) early on in ""The Raven"" and presumably that line was part of the producers original pitch meeting. Im guessing the phrase "" Se7en meets Sherlock Holmes"" was tossed about too. A grimly preposterous serial-killer thriller set in 19th-century Baltimore this riff on the final days of the author of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and other masterpieces of the macabre might qualify as literary desecration if it werent so silly.Cusacks Poe -- conceived here as close cousin to Robert Downey Jrs Holmes -- is a talented wreck whose best days are behind him but who can still rear up and spit in the eye of the philistines of which there are many in 1849 Baltimore. They include his editor (Kevin McNally) and Captain Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson) wealthy and extremely hostile father to Poes beloved Emily (Alice Eve).A depraved murderer is stalking the city killing citizens in ways that copycat the authors famous stories. A gruesome early highlight is the longtime Poe rival (John Warnaby) who gets the pit-and-pendulum treatment in disgusting detail. ""But Im only a critic"" he shrieks before expiring. I felt much the same way.Initially a suspect Poe ends up joining forces with the police inspector on the case the manly Detective Fields (Luke Evans). The two race desperately from one horrific crime scene to the next -- at a masked ball in a church backstage at a theater in the sewers of Baltimore -- and theyre led hither and thither by a mastermind whose cunning and resources seem increasingly far-fetched. ""The Masque of the Red Death"" ""The Cask of Amontillado"" ""The Mystery of Marie Roget"" -- so many tales to choose from. ""The Premature Burial"" is reserved for Emily who in Eves performance treats the ordeal as a particularly bad hair day.""The Raven"" has been directed by James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta"") with dark style and at galloping speed neither of which disguise the fact that the movie often doesnt make a lick of sense. If it were content to lighten up and admit it was trash there might be some fun to be had but the dialogue by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare mistakes the florid for the eloquent. (""God gave him a spark of genius and quenched it with misery"" someone says about Poe.) The jolts are effective in their Pavlovian way; its everything else that lets you down.Sadly the overripe notion of Edgar Allan Poe action hero never takes off. Cusack wants to give a serious performance -- historically inaccurate goatee and all -- in a movie that isnt built for it. (Lets hope Benjamin Walker in this summers ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" doesnt have the same problem.) The star is pale enough to qualify for a Tim Burton movie but hes awfully well-fed to play late-stage Poe and he never summons up the glint of madness you get in photographs of the author. Behind the blowhard arrogance Edgar seems eminently sane -- not exactly whats called for.What ""The Raven"" lacks in narrative invention it makes up for by pushing the audiences face in blood guts and hacked flesh. You get that the filmmakers are going for a modern take on Poes Gothic vision but their approach has no poetry and barely any prose. After the ""Holmes"" movies ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and this the steampunk-action genre may be played out. Quoth the audience ""Nevermore.""Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

With John Cusack. Director James McTeigue (143). R violence. At area theaters. What a ridiculous proposition ""The Raven"" is. Cloaked in shadows and fog and scratching furiously at the corners of every murder mystery ever to darken a doily on PBS this wannabe Sherlockian thriller is like a night spent at Madame Tussauds watching mannequins strangle other mannequins. John Cusack plays writer and poet Edgar Allan Poe whose last week in 1849 Baltimore as imagined by screenwriters Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare is spent in pursuit of a killer taking images from Poes famously macabre stories and making them real. (The most grisly involves a poor soul who has to live out ""The Pit and the Pendulum."") Poe a perpetually penniless often drunk blowhard who here stalks the cobblestone streets in a cape and who goes home to dissect organs in front of his pet raccoon soon realizes the murders are -- horrors -- inspired by scenes in his own stories. When his fiancee (an underutilized Alice Eve) is kidnapped and buried alive in a coffin under the floorboard -- a la ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" -- Poe and the citys police inspector (Luke Evans) try to put together the clues racing from church to opera house to various mansions for the next revelation. Poe himself must provide a running commentary per the killers instructions penning dreadful little tales ordered to appear in each mornings newspaper. Cusack his goatee-framed mouth perpetually agape in combination of intellectual outrage and stunned revelation has a fine time wallowing in Poes melancholia but cuts a more preposterous figure as a literary action hero -- a deed few men it must be said are made for. While Cusack can handle the dark humor he comes dangerously close to seeming like a parody -- perhaps ""John Wilkes Booth Antebellum Exorcist."" Director James McTeigue (""V for Vendetta"") juices up the 19th-century detective work with lethargic pistol play galloping horse chases and gory corpses. But his villain - whose true identity could have been dreamed up by a screenwriting program after being fed the plots of ""Silence of the Lambs"" ""Seven"" and ""Copycat"" -- still dresses like The Shadow while people say things like ""Poe youve done it again"" and ""The ways of God and men as in Providence is not our way.""

"Review The Raven - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Raven Once upon a drama dreary  Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 movies you should look forward to this summer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Quoth the raven ""Eh.""Showcasing John Cusack as Edgar Allan Poe on the trail of a copycat serial killer the strangely dull new film""The Raven"" squanders a promising scenario while half-burying Cusacks mercurial skills as a leading man with the wiles of a character actor. Someone in 1849 Baltimore is on a murder spree riffing on methods of torture and execution depicted in ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" and other works of the melancholic alcoholic Poe. Its like a grisly one-person interactive book club focused on one mans literary output.Written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare ""The Raven"" invents a gallery of fictional characters to juice up Poes final days. A local detective played by a bland Luke Evans suspects Poe may be the one behind the Poe-inspired carnage. Poes intended (Alice Eve the films brightest element) the daughter of a prominent local businessman (Brendan Gleeson) believes in her man certainly more than her disapproving father does.For a while you give the film the benefit of the doubt. Shooting in period-appropriate Budapest Hungary and Belgrade Serbia albeit with too few extras on the streets director James McTeigue pushes the story along to the next outre splatter incident. But in terms of tone I honestly dont know how McTeigue intended this material.McTeigue directed ""V for Vendetta""and like that picture ""The Raven"" is crowded with incident yet isnt very exciting or fluid as cinema. The works of Poe are naturals for the screen and their beauty lies in their raw intensity adaptable for lowdown pulp purposes. The Roger Corman-produced Poe adaptations may not have been faithful to the originals but they worked their own rough magic. The notion in ""The Raven"" of Poe chasing after his unwanted protege before he kills again is a good start. But theres no real kick or shiver to the events nor to the ultimate revelation.At one point Cusacks Poe mutters ""Ive used up all my tricks"" bemoaning his fate as a fiction writer trying to make ends meet. Its the same thought most every writer and indeed most actors fear at some point in their careers. With a stylishly dour goatee and air of charismatic minimalist despair Cusacks portrayal feels like a look a character design in search of completion. As with many fine actors Cusack walks a thin line between droll understatement and practiced diffidence. McTeigue treats him like a star and Cusack has his moments. But too many individual scenes requiring sweep and propulsion -- a masked ball the murderer running loose backstage at a theater -- never get out of second gear. And however many digitally created ravens appear on screen in ""The Raven"" its one too many.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet On paper The Raven looks like it was inspired by kindred films like Kafka Naked Lunch and The Rum Diary which place an author inside his own stories. But on the screen its more a companion to 2009s Sherlock Holmes--a similarly over-the-top visually busy adventure thriller about a Victorian literary hero plagued by a criminal mastermind. Like Robert Downey Jr.s interpretation of Holmes as a flouncing sulky genius who solves (and creates) most of his problems with obnoxiousness John Cusacks take on the Edgar Allan Poe of The Raven is all bristling entitled arrogance wrapped around a fierce core of self-destruction. (""I believe God gave him a spark of genius and quenched it in misery"" sums up newspaper editor and intermittent Poe supporter Brian Blessed early on in the film.) The plot has a police detective (Luke Evans) consulting Poe for help solving a series of ghastly murders clearly modeled on Poes stories. Then the murderer kidnaps Poes fiancee (Alice Eve) to up the stakes. Hes an old cliche--a serial killer who baits his pursuers as if he wants to be caught--but theres more method to the madness than is initially apparent. Director James McTeigue (V For Vendetta Ninja Assassin) mounts The Raven with visual splash and a rich production design that often looks overblown (especially during a Poe-derived killing splattered with CGI blood) but never cheap. Cusack delivers an appealingly eager performance channeling his best Nicolas Cage in froth-and-rant mode. And screenwriters Ben Livingston (an actor turned first-time writer) and Hannah Shakespeare (who scripted Kevin Bacons directorial debut Loverboy) start in an interesting direction by making Poe not a hero so much as a tortured railing victim distinctly in Evans debt and his intellectual shadow. (Evans intelligent precise character seems to be bucking for Sherlock Holmes duty; curious that Poe a detective-fiction pioneer is so sneeringly contemptuous of his forensic science.) But the story gets increasingly conventional as it goes on until Poe becomes just another action hero following an increasingly illogical National Treasure-esque set of clues through a series of confrontations. Poe was a flawed figure but his greatest strength was in avoiding convention or reinterpreting it to create something new. The Raven aspires to both but abandons those ambitions to lie limply on the floor--only this and nothing more.

"Raven The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; raven-the ) Raven The (United States/Hungary/Spain 2012) April 24 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli If Sherlock Holmes can be a yesteryear James Bond and Abraham Lincoln can be a vampire slayer then whos to say that Edgar Allan Poe cant be the worlds most literate consulting detective? With a script co-written by Shakespeare (Hannah that is) and headlines ripped from Poes stories The Raven is period piece fun - at least until it realizes there has to be a conclusion. Thats where a certain amount of inevitable disappointment sets in. The curse of the two-hour murder mystery is that the ending never seems to justify the build-up. The Raven uses some of the real-life mysteries from Poes final days to form the backdrop of a fictional tale about a serial killer who models his work on scenes from the authors goriest stories. Director James McTeigue doesnt skimp when it comes to showing blood and guts. The murder inspired by ""The Pit and the Pendulum"" is especially grotesque rivaling the most extreme scene from any splatter/slasher film. The camera does not shy away from showing the ""money shot""; dont expect a cut-away. The graphic nature of this sequence is counterproductive since for the most part The Raven is not trying to be a horror movie. The concept of a mass murderer constructing his ""artistry"" in blood and viscera while using Poes body of work as a template has potential but rarely does the screenplay fulfill its possibilities. The Ravens tent pole is the battle of wills between Poe (as played by John Cusack) and his mysterious opponent. To heighten the stakes Poes secret fiancA(c)e Emily (Alice Eve) is kidnapped by the killer. The goal is for Poe to follow the clues left at each murder scene and discover her whereabouts before her death is sealed. Her antagonistic father (Brendan Gleeson) and a dashing policeman Detective Fields (Luke Evans) aid in the chase. The decision to keep the killers identity secret is a mistake. It creates expectations that result in an unsatisfactory unmasking. The Raven would almost certainly worked better had we known from the start who Poes adversary is; then we could have enjoyed the high-stakes chess game between them without being distracted by applying the Law of Conservation of Characters to figure out who the shadowy puppet master is. Films like The Usual Suspects which successfully obfuscate the identity of the villain and generate a genuine ""gotcha"" moment are few and far between. The Raven will not be counted among their number. Cusack provides a credible Poe much in the mold of the clichA(c)d ""tortured artist."" The character is an atypical thriller hero - hes melancholy uses vocabulary above the sixth grade reading level and rarely gets physical. He looks great with the impeccably groomed facial hair and the billowing black cape (almost like a musketeer). Because Poe is a dour and static man of words we need someone more physical to act as his sidekick. The somewhat thankless role goes to Luke Evans who growls his lines as if trying to impersonate Christian Bales Batman. Alice Eve is criminally underused; she spends most of her time confined in a coffin although she manages more screen time than Brendan Gleeson whose command of an underwritten and poorly motivated character indicates he should have been given a much larger part. For fans of Poe the movie contains numerous references to his work. Many are obvious; some are subtle. For those who dont know Poe from the Pope it wont matter. For the most part the movie plays out like a period piece murder mystery. In fact the setting is so generic for this sort of film that it might as easily be 19th century pre-Ripper London as 19th century Baltimore. (It is in fact the latter. Poe died in Baltimore on October 7 1849.) The Raven looks great and is well-paced but a lack of a compelling resolution makes it an anemic effort. The literate nature of much of the dialogue is undercut by the plot-by-numbers nature of the story arc. While its pleasant to hear characters speak with sophistication their flowery lines ring hollow when one considers that the same level of intelligence was not applied to developing the narrative. Like the atmospheric set design its window dressing. The Raven contains some nice details and its use of an historical personage is of some interest but the bottom line is theres not enough thats sufficiently original or compelling to warrant more than a lukewarm recommendation.

Positing that Poe spent the last five days of his life in 1849 helping the police to hunt down a serial killer in Baltimore ""The Raven"" is a squawking silly picture that never takes flight. In the spirit of upcoming historical fantasy ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" helmer James McTeigues pic would have been more fun if it were called ""Edgar Allan Poe Drunk Poet Detective"" but that would have implied more entertainment value than this dreary exercise delivers. Leads John Cusack and Luke Evans might generate a little B.O. traction but it will quickly fade like a dream within a dream. Plucking some easily researchable biographical details about Poe the script by actor-turned-scribe Ben Livingston and Ron Bass protege Hannah Shakespeare constructs an implausible explanation of what happened to the author before he was found on a park bench raving incoherently about someone named Reynolds on the last day of his life. Given his notorious dipsomaniac habits and penchant for opium as well as theories that he had syphilis (a fact the screenplay unsurprisingly doesnt explore) its probable the real Poe simply died from partying too heartily. Not the most cinematic or original story but then the standard-issue serial-killer cliches offered up here arent much more interesting. When the police discover two dead femmes in a locked room Det. Emmett Fields (the ubiquitous Luke Evans) works out that the killer must have made his escape through a locked window with a hidden spring -- just like the assailant in ""The Murders in the Rue Morgue"" a story by local writer-cum-lush Poe (Cusack). At first making the remarkably stupid assumption that Poe must therefore be the killer Fields eventually concludes the culprit is someone obsessively conversant with Poes fiction and poetry especially when the authors archrival critic Griswold (John Warnaby) turns up dead sliced in two by pendulum-operated axe. (His desperate cry before he dies ""But Im only a critic"" may rep the pics sole funny line.) The two are forced to work together when Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) a young heiress to whom Poe has become secretly engaged is kidnapped at a masked ball held by her father Col. Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson). Poe and Fields must ponder clues planted on yet more corpses in order to deduce where Emily has been hidden; in a ""Misery""-style twist the psychotic fan insists that Poe write up his detective work as an ongoing narrative to be printed each day in the local paper run by editor Henry Maddox (""Pirates of the Caribbean"" regular Kevin McNally forever playing men with muttonchops). Anachronistic dialogue like ""Shut it Emily or Ill shut it for you"" suggests historical verisimilitude isnt a top priority here but even so ""The Raven"" plays fast and loose with period detail as when a newspaper headline screams about a ""serial killer"" never mind that the term wasnt coined until nearly 130 years later. Cusack whose wrinkle-free face looks far too plumped up and healthy to pass for that of a raging alcoholic tries project erratic temper by shouting a lot and bugging out his eyes but the script doesnt feed him a single line that might suggest Poes genius complexity or vaunted verbal dexterity. The completely fictitious characters arent saddled with such a heavy burden of history but theyre never more than stock types. Only Sam Hazeldine impresses with a juicy turn thats due as much to the way hes lit as to his actorly skill. Locations in Serbia and Hungary are passably convincing although the visual effects used to depict a Parisian street scene at the very end are nearly as awkward as the epilogue itself while the abrasive rock music over the ""Seven""-style end titles proves jarring. At least the costumes are fab especially the elaborate duds worn in the ball scene featuring feathered headdresses and intricate masks that would look great on an Alexander McQueen catwalk.

Languishing in nineteenth-century Baltimore and making a meagre living as a newspaper hack Poe is soon back on the front page when a killer begins copying death scenes from the great authors most famous stories. Teaming up with young detective Fields (Luke Evans) Poe must convince the local constabulary hes not the killer while simultaneously trying to prevent any more deaths.For the first hour or so The Raven trundles along inoffensively the characterisation is slight and the script rather plodding but the visuals are suitably brooding and stormy. Theres at least one inventive death scene and its always nice to catch cameo turns from the likes of Brendan Gleeson and Pam Ferris. But then the plot begins to unravel. The final unmasking is idiotic and it all wraps up with a hilariously unconvincing coda. Its impossible to shake the feeling that The Raven has been badly knocked about in post-production resulting in a film that despite a strong visual sense has simply no grasp on its characters or its plot. Nevermore indeed.

Although the movie has a promising idea basing a serial killer off of poes work the movie is nothing but underwhelming. Although ive supported and loved John Cusack throughout his years in film he is better off sticking with Lloyd Dobler or Lane Meyer. He seems completely unexcited and unconnected from his role. While Brendan Gleeson provides some life to the movie it is all over the place and falls flat in the end. It is completely unaware of what it wants to be (comedy satire love horror thriller) and it fails to focus on the most important aspect..
