"Tangled is old yet new - CNN.com Part of complete coverage on Academy Awards Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Tangled is old yet new By Tom Charity CNN The new Disney film ""Tangled"" is a retelling of the story of Rapunzel complete with 3-D action. STORY HIGHLIGHTS""Tangled"" retells the fairytale of Rapunzel and her hairThe Disney production utilizes 3-D technologySinger Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel RELATED TOPICS Movies Entertainment The Walt Disney Company (CNN) -- Disney goes back to its roots with ""Tangled"" an animated fairy story in the tradition of ""Snow White"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" but not without adding a few new digital 3-D kinks. The tale of Rapunzel goes back 400 years or more. Snatched from her rightful parents as a baby by an evil crone Rapunzel is locked in a tower in the middle of the woods visited only by the witch. In the most memorable detail the girls long tresses serve as the crones ladder ""Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair"" In Disneys telling Rapunzel is desperate to do just that though shes now a princess stolen by the old woman for her hairs magical rejuvenating powers Botox without the needle. The new title ""Tangled"" is an attempt to lure boys and men into the theater were told. Instead of the bland handsome prince of the story -- always a ho-hum character in fairy tales -- screenwriter Dan Fogelman (""Cars"" ""Bolt"") has come up with a reckless rapscallion Flynn Rider a merry thief who snatches the missing princess tiara and inadvertently returns it to its true owner as he flees the palace guards. Rapunzels 21st century makeover Flynn (his name is clearly inspired by Errol) does bring a dash of energy and action to the film whether its bounding over the castle rooftops or engaging in a slapstick duel with his most dedicated pursuer one of the kings horses. But Rapunzel proves more than a match for this handsome intruder. She may look like a Barbie doll but Rapunzel is another addition to the more recent Disney tradition of emancipated heroines a sister to the Little Mermaid and Mulan. A dab hand with a frying pan and twirling her hair like a lariat she soon makes Flynn her prisoner and insists he help her get away from her ivory tower. This snappy role reversal may or may not appeal to young men -- getting repeatedly clunked on the head with a kitchen utensil isnt every boys fantasy -- but it inspires some classic knockabout screwball comedy and an exciting vertiginous escape sequence. Voicing Rapunzel Mandy Moore sings Alan Menkens yearning ballads very sweetly and goes some way to banish the bad memories of ""License to Wed."" But the stand-out performance is Tony-winner Donna Murphy as the passive-aggressive crone Mother Gothel who seizes Menkens grand theatrical number ""Mother Knows Best"" for the showstopper it deserves to be. iReport Interviews with the cast of Tangled As evil stepmothers go Gothel is a relatively subtle villain an overprotective mom who wants to preserve her daughters purity to hold on to her own lost youth. What could be wrong with that? Theres a head-scratchingly devious bit of plotting when Gothel has Rapunzel in her clutches and decides to let her go. (Since when did witches get so psychological?) But this paves the way for the films most lyrical romantic sequence when Rapunzel and Flynn watch hundreds of lanterns float through the air so close that you want to reach out and touch them. Its the single most effective use of 3-D since ""Avatar"" a pretty ribbon tied to a pleasingly spry gloss on a very old story.

For 60 years of the Walt Disney Companys domination of the format girls were the focal characters who could be expected to come of age triumph over adversity and in general man up. But the current animation zeitgeist at Pixar DreamWorks and Foxs Blue Sky (the Ice Age series) concentrates on buddy movies and has all but abolished female-centered stories. It cant be simply that the Cartoon Directors Club is almost exclusively a male preserve since the classic Disney films from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to Mulan were also men-made. It may be that their bosses think girls will go to boys movies but boys wont go to girls. Feature animation is an expensive business and gynocentric films are seen as a niche too small to be worth the cost. (See the top 10 worst chick flicks.) At the Disney animation unit now supervised by Pixars John Lasseter theres still a belief in girl power -- as shown with spectacular elan and artistry in last years The Princess and the Frog and today in the pleasing warming Tangled. Its the Brothers Grimm story of Rapunzel imprisoned in a high tower by a witch with the girls long hair the witchs only means of access and egress. Under house arrest for years agitating for her freedom mourned by the kingdom that misses her shes the Aung San Suu Kyi of fairy-tale heroines. Just a few differences Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) has 70-ft.-long (21 m) tresses that can serve as a rope ladder; her jailer is not the Burmese government but the crone Gothel (Donna Murphy); and whereas Suu Kyi remained in confinement while her husband died of cancer in London our princess finds a dashing thief known as Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) to facilitate her escape. (See the top 10 Disney controversies.) Ever since Walts day Disney animators have thought that a musical film could be made from the Grimm brothers story. It has the skeletal plot -- yearning heroine wicked overseer and male savior -- of Disney cartoon epics in the studios early years (Snow White Cinderella) and its 90s renaissance (The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast). As of 2005 Rapunzel Unbraided as it was known was to be the first feature directed by honored Disney animator Glen Keane. Five years later in a history as long and twisted as its heroines hair theres finally a movie with Byron Howard and Nathan Greno directing and Keane back in his customary role as character animator supreme. The title was changed to Tangled because The Princess and the Frog was no great shakes at the box office and because Disney wanted to make the project seem less ... girlish. The trailers suggest that the movie is an action comedy about a roguish guy (Flynn) whose mission is to storm the tower and free the girl inside. But no this is your basic and very enjoyable Disney princess musical an empowerment tale to teach bright dreamy girls how to grow to maturity -- and outgrow the adults in charge. In the Grimm version the husband in a childless couple sneaks into the garden of Gothel the witch to steal a flower that guarantees fertility; the witch catches him and demands the couples firstborn whom she raises as her captive daughter until a prince shows up etc. (Ignored in all versions is this question If Rapunzel can secure her tresses to a hook to allow the witch to climb up and down why cant she hook the end of her coiffure and climb down it?) Here Gothel discovers that the girls hair somehow brings eternal youth or at least chic middle age to an old witch. She can swan around as long as her victim stays locked up. Gothel knows the secret that many American parents act out but are slow to acknowledge that confining their teens in enforced preadolescence helps them feel younger too. As if uneasy at being left behind by the competition this Disney near classic wades into the DreamWorks style of sitcom gags and anachronistic sass. (""Sorry Blondie"" Flynn tells Rapunzel at one point ""I dont do backstory."") But the visual palette is more sophisticated especially in the scenes where sparkling nocturnal lanterns illuminate Rapunzels birthday and the film gradually achieves the complex mix of romance comedy adventure and heart that defines the best Disney features. The inevitable animal friends -- a horse for Flynn and a chameleon for Rapunzel -- radiate plenty of personality without speaking. Moore does well by her slightly underwritten role while Murphy a treasured musical-theater diva for a quarter-century (The Human Comedy Song of Singapore Passion The King and I)) makes Gothel one of the most potent schemers in the Disney canon. Visually the character suggests Bebe Neuwirth in her Morticia Addams get-up but no one can summon the malice in humor and the fun in pain like this prima Donna. Tangled is the first Disney animated feature since 1997 with music by Alan Menken who scored most of the studios renaissance films back when numbers from cartoon musicals not only monopolized the Academy Awards Best Original Song category but also broke out as top-of-the-pops hits and instant standards. His The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast along with Elton Johns The Lion King became long-running Broadway shows. Tangled should be even easier to adapt to the stage since for once the main characters are all human -- no singing teapots monsters or meerkats required. (See 10 movies that shouldnt have made it to Broadway.) The songs with lyrics by Glenn Slater dont sound on first hearing like top-drawer Menken but they smoothly fill their functions. The opener ""When Will My Life Begin"" is the heroines ""I wanna"" song a Disney tradition that stretches back to Snow Whites ""Some Day My Prince Will Come."" The witchs ""Mother Knows Best"" is a pot of poisoned honey from the killer queen bee. Menken and Slater also contribute a generically tuneful love ballad ""I See the Light"" which is sure to be nominated for a Best Song Oscar and a criminals chorus called ""Ive Got a Dream."" Proclaiming that every scurvy brigand is at heart just a Broadway gypsy between shows its the scores main example of roistering wit. The song will play superbly as the second-act opener in the stage version were imagining for which we can also award Murphy a just slightly premature Tony as Best Actress in a Musical. First though the movie version has to be a hit. So give the kids a break from mopey Harry and the dawdling Hallows -- give yourself a break too -- and get caught up in Tangled.

Who knew the years best romantic comedy would be a cartoon? CAST Voices of Mandy Moore Zachary Levi Donna Murphy WHEN/WHERE Showtimes and tickets LENGTH 132 With condolences to Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler in ""The Bounty Hunter"" Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel in ""Life As We Know It"" Ashton Kutcher and his 70 co-stars in ""Valentines Day"" the years best romantic comedy has no actors at all. Not visible ones at least. ""Tangled"" Disneys animated musical twist on the Rapunzel tale has a terrific voice cast that includes Mandy Moore as an exceptionally long-haired teen and Zachary Levi (NBCs ""Chuck"") as a dashing young bandit. It also features Broadway veteran Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel an astoundingly evil character who clearly wants to join the Psychotic Disney Mommy Club. Unlike live-action romances that typically rely on ""chemistry"" mixing stars together and hoping theyll explode ""Tangled"" begins with engaging characters and a clever story - a much better formula. Its based on a fairy tale but isnt that what romantic comedies are? advertisement | advertise on newsday In this version the royal infant Rapunzel is kidnapped by Mother Gothel who needs the childs magic hair to restore her youth. It works Eighteen years on the old lady looks better than Cher. Rapunzel meanwhile has spent her life captive in a tower. When the wanted thief Flynn Rider (Levi) climbs in looking for a hideout she sees her chance for adventure. These are timeless themes - domineering parent sheltered child dangerous boyfriend - all woven together nicely by a crew of filmmakers from the Disney-Pixar trenches.

The fairy tale in this case is aRapunzela the heroine (voiced by Mandy Moore) a princess shut up in the high tower of a castle by a bogus mother (Donna Murphy) who stole her as an infant for the rejuvenating power of her long tresses. Itas a full-scale musical too. Early on Rapunzel sings a ditty called aWhen Will My Life Begin?a that recounts how she spends her days and nights and though itas awfully sprightly for a lifelong shut-in Moore has a supple voice the staging is amusing and the tune (by Alan Menken) is catchy. Rapunzel has a little chameleon named Pascal with huge eyes that perches on her shoulders and gets a few good reaction shots. I canat help liking a movie with chameleon reaction shots. Her prince is an egotistical bandit who calls himself Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) and he climbs into her window to escape a vigilant horse he stole that turned around and came after him. (I cant help liking a movie in which a man is pursued by a horse.) By and by Flynn and Rapunzel end up in a tavern full of slobbering giants and grotesques who first seem threatening but then show their sunnier sides. They sing a song called ""Ive Got a Dream"" that rhymes ""femurs"" and ""dreamers"" and has a line that goes ""Ive got scars and lumps and bruises/plus something here that oozes."" Very nice. Tangled is no big deal but its nowhere near as hard on the eyes as the Shrek movies and its full of felicitous touches. (Pixars John Lasseter was an executive producer.) In a film in which theres only one real villain its good that shes voiced by Murphy whos Broadways gift to animated movies. In one scene the faux-mother becomes distraught at Rapunzels ""unreasonable"" demand to be let out of her tower and Murphy puts a world of righteous indignation into the movies best line ""Oh so Im the bad guy now?"" Well uh yes you are--and youre going to get a comeuppance thats worthy of you. Relax and enjoy.

The pleasure starts with two magnificent performances Colin Firth as King George VI afflicted by a terrible stutter and Geoffrey Rush as an unorthodox Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue. And the depth of feeling in Tom Hoopers film is matched by the breadth of its appeal. Heres a period piece with irresistible immediacy a brilliant pairing of a monarch whos heroic by virtue of his personal struggle and an uncommon commoner who helps him find his authentic voice. Watch a clip from The Weinstein Companys ""The Kings Speech"" starring Colin Firth Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter. David Seidler based his script on a little-known story from England between the wars. King George VI--the father of Queen Elizabeth II--did in fact have a stutter though its severity is a matter of debate. (Mr. Seidler had one too which is why he was drawn to the story in the first place.) And the king was indeed treated by Logue a man whod had remarkable success working with shell-shocked Australian veterans of World War I despite his lack of a degree or conventional credentials. Yet the film which opens today in limited release shouldnt be seen as a quasidocumentary any more than it should be mistaken for a big-screen version of ""Masterpiece Theater."" Its great distinction grows out of dramatic inventions and dazzling wit. ""The Kings Speech"" is a captivating fable of egalitarianism a battle royal between social unequals that turns the combatants into cherished friends. The buildup to the battle could hardly be more artful. The story begins in 1934 when the future king is still the Duke of York; his father King George V (Michael Gambon) still wears the crown and his brother the Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce) is besotted by the American divorcee Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). The Duke of York or Bertie as hes known to his family cant avoid the occasional agony of speaking in public or the unmitigated torture of confronting a microphone radio being a relatively new and increasingly pervasive medium. Desperate for help he turns to Logue who insists that their sessions be conducted on a first-name basis and in his agreeably seedy apartment rather than the royal residence. These early encounters are wonderfully funny. Logue wont indulge his patients stuffiness while Bertie considers Logue a charlatan until a breakthrough moment that involves Hamlets soliloquy and a recording machine. Berties desperation turns to panic though when his father suddenly dies his brother abdicates and Bertie finds himself the reluctant and all-but-mute king of a country that doubts his competence yet needs his leadership as war clouds gather once again. ENLARGE Colin Firth as King George VI in The Kings Speech. Weinstein Co. No screen portrait of a king has ever been more stirring--heartbreaking at first then stirring. Thats partly due to the screenplay which contains two of the best-written roles in recent memory and to Mr. Hoopers superb direction. (More about that later.) But what Mr. Firth makes of his role is sheer magic. Fear forlorn hopelessness self-irony self-loathing towering anger unyielding courage he plays it all with Shakespearean fullness and Chekhovian tact and all by way of revealing the memorable presence of a good man. In a film with abundant conflict but no villain the goodness of Mr. Rushs man reveals itself through tenacity and unflappable humor. This irreverent version of Lionel Logue turns out to be an Aussie variant of a Frank Capra hero a little guy who refuses to be awed by big guys even one with lofty lineage and a throne. (Logue outrages Bertie to therapeutic effect by sitting on the throne in Westminster Abbey prior to the coronation.) The scenes between them are enormous fun and grounded in the details of Logues professional process. He shows his patient how to loosen his tongue by shaking his jowls--Mr. Rushs Shar-Pei features are perfectly suited to this exercise--by jumping up and down rolling on the floor unregally speaking his thoughts to the tune of ""Swanee River"" or firing off a fusillade of four-letter words that will have George Carlin grinning in his grave. (Those words have already earned the movie an R rating.) When this years awards are passed out both Mr. Firth and Mr. Rush better come with acceptance speeches in their pockets. And ""The Kings Speech"" positively swarms with fine supporting performances especially that of Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth the queen mother. Ms. Bonham Carters portrayal isnt flashy but her presence is crucial. She gives Elizabeth the warmth of heart and liveliness of spirit to sustain her husband in his darkest days and to delight him in his bright ones. When the Hamlet breakthrough comes the camera holds briefly on his face which is frozen with astonishment but quickly moves to her face for eloquent confirmation that something important has just happened. That camera move is a directorial choice one of the innumerable decisions that contribute to Mr. Hoopers elegant self-effacing style. His direction of actors is nearly flawless. (Timothy Spalls Winston Churchill is awfully much.) A filmmaker who frames his own shots he uses the camera--and particularly the very wide 18mm lens that Stanley Kubrick famously favored--to create a distinctive look in which spaces become as striking as the people in them. (Many of the encounters between Bertie and Lionel are set in the latters consultation room a cavernous space whose expansive walls are covered with peeling wallpaper that could have been designed by Matisse.) And he makes music an accomplice rather than an accompaniment to the action. Not just the lovely score by Alexandre Desplat but the throbbing and soaring passages from Beethovens Seventh symphony that punctuate the movies climactic speech. That choice might have pushed the climax into excess but the result is simply sublime. Tangled Watch a clip from ""Tangled"" Disneys new animated comedy. Video courtesy of Walt Disney Pictures. The Rapunzel of Disneys ""Tangled"" is remarkably healthy for a teen whos been in solitary confinement most of her life. Something of the same can be said of this animated feature from a studio that has long been locked in a struggle to recapture its former glories. The film is picture-book pretty and fairly conventional except for the 3-D which is emerging as a convention in its own right. Still the prettiness comes with brains and the whole production like those newly eye-catching models of American-made cars bespeaks resurgent confidence. ENLARGE Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) and Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) in Tangled. Disney Enterprises ""When will my life begin?"" Rapunzel asks in the first song of Alan Menkens engaging sometimes rousing Broadway-style score. The movie which was directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard from a script by Dan Fogelman begins rather frantically with the arrival at Rapunzels tower of her rescuer-to-be a too-hip bandit who calls himself Flynn Rider. She is voiced delightfully by Mandy Moore and he--his real name is Eugene--is voiced archly though likeably by Zachary Levi. As far as physiognomy is concerned much is made of her 70 feet of radiant magic hair while he suggests a cross between Robert Pattinson and Adrien Brody. Soon enough though the frenzy gives way to ingeniously energetic entertainment. The turning point is a terrific number prompted by another song ""Ive Got A Dream""; suddenly the screen is filled with what I can only describe as Visigoth vaudevillians. Donna Murphy does evil deliciously as the voice of Mother Gothel Rapunzels kidnapper and captor. No one voices Maximus a wordless horse whos determined to capture Flynn Rider but he steals every scene hes in. Pascal is endearing too. A silent chameleon hes a horse of many different colors. Tiny Furniture Once in a great while a debut feature leaves you blinking in amazement at the bountiful talent. ""Tiny Furniture"" did that for me. (Last week the film opened in New York. This week it starts its national release.) Lena Dunham now 24 years old is the writer director and star of this marvelously strange semiautobiographical comedy about 22-year-old Aura a young woman who diagnoses herself to be in a state of postgraduate delirium. (Auras actual state is far more primal and affecting.) The movie features the filmmakers real-life photographer mother Laurie Simmons who gives a dryly understated performance as Auras photographer mother Siri; and her real-life sister Grace Dunham who plays Auras overachieving sister Nadine. (The title refers to little props used by her mother in photos that resonate with Auras wistful yearning for her lost childhood.) From the first line of dialogue--a faintly self-mocking ""Honey Im home""--its clear that this heroine has problems. Its equally clear that theres no honey. There she is overweight and forlorn bringing her bags and Gilda her caged hamster into the upscale Manhattan apartment that she used to call home before going off to get a college degree in film studies. Auras only claim to fame is having memorialized a dyslexic stripper in an online video that collected 400 hits. (Prior to shooting this film Ms. Dunham had received 1.5 million hits on YouTube for a video that displayed her ample self stripped down to a bikini and bathing in a fountain on the campus of Oberlin College.) And her loneliness only grows more intense after meeting Jed (an impressively smarmy performance by Alex Karpovsky) a self-styled video artist who moves in with her and sponges off her but wont deign to do her the favor of having sex with her. ""Tiny Furniture"" teems with deft observations and vivid characters. (Jemima Kirke isnt just vivid but sensational as Auras beautiful and sardonic friend Charlotte.) The cinematographer was Jody Lee Lipes who used the HD video function of a single-lens-reflex camera made for the high end of the consumer market and who may have been emulating--with conspicuous success--the minimalist style of the Japanese master Yasujiro Ozu. Emotional minimalism is Ms. Dunhams style. Any visible passion has been expunged from her heroines life. Aura lives in a twilight state that recalls the two high-school graduates of Terry Zwigoffs 2001 film ""Ghost World."" She is older than they were of course which makes her plight more pathetic. But pathos isnt Ms. Dunhams bag. What makes her film fascinating is the delicate mood it sustains. One day Aura may go forth into the adult world that frightens her so. For now though she would climb back into the womb if she could. White Material This lean and shattering film by Claire Denis who wrote the screenplay with Marie Ndiaye is set in an unnamed Francophone nation of black Africa where rebels led by a man called The Boxer have begun to overthrow the regime. The title like the film says a lot in a little. For the nations blacks white material is a sardonic phrase that may be used to describe fabric a cigarette lighter luxury goods or by extension the movies heroine Maria who is played with ferocious brilliance by Isabelle Huppert. As an individual Maria is the very definition of tenacity. She loves the land and the people who live on it. She takes pride in the coffee plantation that her family owns and works as hard on it as any of her plantation hands. She will not be driven from her home and cant believe that such a thing will come to pass even though frightened blacks are already in flight from roving bands of child soldiers. Her obsessive concern is hiring enough help to bring in the new harvest. As a tacitly symbolic individual in a political setting however Maria misreads all of the signs that point to chaos. She chooses to believe in an unexamined way that the regular army will prevail or at least maintain order. Whats more she knows many of the rebels and their families as friends or valued acquaintances and cant imagine--its truly a failure of imagination--the horrors to come when they and not only they turn against her. Indeed when The Boxer--hes played with quiet gravity by Isaach De Bankole--comes to her plantation wounded and seeking refuge Maria sees him as someone whos in temporary danger just as she is so she feeds him and dresses his wounds. The context in ""White Material"" as in such previous Claire Denis films as ""Beau Travail"" and ""Chocolat"" is postcolonialism--where do former colonials belong and what do they do when the fabric of their lives unravels? Thats an abstraction though and ""White Material"" is anything but abstract. Its a portrait by turns chilling thrilling mysterious and terrifying of a woman who refuses to be terrorized. Burlesque Will anyone who reads this pay money to see ""Burlesque""? On the unlikely chance that youre considering it here are a few things you need to know. Watch a clip from the new film ""Burlesque"" starring Cher and Christina Aguilera. Video courtesy of Sony Entertainment. The movie is rated PG-13 which means its slightly naughty if youre a 13-year-old but basically a theme-park version of a tawdry tradition. On the other hand if you happen to fit Chers demographic rather than Christina Aguileras you may prefer to see the film as a burlesque of burlesque or a remix of ""Cabaret"" that retains some of Bob Fosses moves black derbies and finger-snaps but dispenses with the politics context sophistication nuance and irony. (Instead of a decadent little club in Weimar Berlin the main setting is a theater on the Sunset Strip owned by Chers Tess a burlesque veteran with an all-purpose expression of poupee-doll bemusement.) In this her first feature film which was written and directed by Steve Antin Ms. Aguilera is Ali a stage-struck Iowa girl who decides to head for L.A. She simulates acting semiconsistently and sometimes likably. Its impossible to know if shes actually acting since the music-video cutting rhythms dont give her time to sustain so much as a compound sentence not that the script provides any. The same thing applies to her dancing which in the twitchy tradition of modern musicals is a mosaic of poses kicks twirls sanitized bumps and euphemized grinds leached of lyrical flow. Her voice is phenomenally loud. This is not a revelation. Her voice has always been loud--its the curse of Andrew Lloyd Webber visited on succeeding generations--and she always sings at the top of it with the urgency of a car alarm. Whats interesting here is that her character is a revolutionary who believes in the power of live performance and wants to do away with the tacky tradition of lip-syncing to iconic songs. When Ali finally does get to sing live though her voice is so loud so over-amped so disproportionate to the physical setting that she sounds lip-synced from start to finish. A burlesque version of Trotsky shes consumed by her revolution. -- Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com.

Referring not just to our heroines hairdo but to her complex personal life it nods at the breezy flippant tween-friendly tone the film adopts. Erstwhile popstrel Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel whose lonely existence imprisoned in a tall tower with only a cheeky chameleon for company is enlivened when she meets brash outlaw Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) and sets out to discover her true identity. Taking its cue from the likes of Shrek and Enchanted Tangled tries to keep kids entertained while tipping ironic winks to their parents meaning it veers wildly between being charmingly off-kilter and annoyingly glib. With two such bland heroes its good that plenty of attention is paid to the supporting characters notably old-school witchy villain Mother Gothel and a bad tempered but loveable horse. The result is brisk witty and entertaining but far from classic Disney.

Plus the title? Really? Anyway following the flop that was Princess and the Frog Disney again tries to take a modern twist on the princess fairy tale they did so well in the 20th Century. Beauty and the Beast Sleeping Beauty Aladdin.. These films will be passed down from generation to generation? Tangled? I doubt anyone will remember it. My distinct feeling about the film was simply that it felt like they were trying too hard trying to keep up with the times as opposed to just going with what they do best. Tangled has a certain Shrek quality to it which makes it funny even hilarious at times and the themes are well thought through. The CGI animation did not blow me way I have to admit the faces look too Barbie like. But I have to admit that the film is really good (I know it doesnt look it) but it is.

Princess Rapunzel is the latest addition to Disneys royal court a slender mite with the most enormous eyes this side of Dora the Explorer. Those huge peepers nearly steal the show from the lustrous blond hair meant to be the main (mane?) attraction. Those eyes rival Bambis enhanced by the computer-generated imagery that create a fairy tale-meets-Pixar look. Everything -- the grass Rapunzels skin a stone staircase -- is smooth as fondant. The story begins with narcissistic Goethel (voiced by Donna Murphy) whose everlasting youth depends on a magical flower. But the flower becomes a gift for the pregnant queen and its rejuvenating powers are somehow absorbed in the hair of the baby she bears. Discovering this Goethel kidnaps the infant. She hides little Rapunzel in a remote castle keep brushing Rapunzels hair as needed to extract the magic that preserves Goethels good looks. As she grows up Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) seems more or less content. A song celebrating domestic chores and crafts provides her back story establishing Rapunzel as a groomed agoraphobe with a strong housefrau bent. Despite Goethels repeated warnings about the dangers lurking outside their cozy tower Rapunzel decides to observe her 18th birthday by sneaking outside for a (very big-eyed) peek at the world. She accomplishes this by wrapping a few feet of her uber-long hair around a hook and then rappelling down her own locks. Her unwilling accomplice Flynn (voiced by Zachary Levi) the handsome vain bandit who initially wants no part of her. When she discloses her mothers warnings about the miscreants waiting to pounce Flynn promises to protect her. Instead hoping to scare Rapunzel into returning home he brings her to the Snuggly Duckling a bar peopled by outlaws and thugs. When they menace Rapunzel she launches into ""I Have a Dream"" the song that will have people humming when they leave the theater. Alan Menken who composed the score and songs for ""Tangled"" refers to this as one of his dumbest songs but its catchy and hilarious as the bad guys reveal their inner yearnings. The guy with the hook for a hand wishes to be a concert pianist. Another one wants to be a mime -- a desire that manifests itself later in ""Tangled"" as one of the rare times that a mime actually has been so funny and engaging that his brief appearance isnt long enough. That sequence marks the movies high point. The rest is charming enough but standard Disney fare Girl dazzled by the world enchants Boy but Girls nemesis interrupts the budding romance. Dramatic chase scenes capped by imminent death is thwarted by ultimate selflessness plus turn-of-fortune opportunity. Alls well that ends well. ""Tangled"" is bound to be a hit with its target audience and (until it comes out on DVD almost certainly is presented on stage) will keep parents entertained. It lacks the sly naughty wit of ""Shrek"" and other Pixar movies but ""Tangled"" has some snappy quips and sight gags including an extended Errol Flynn reference. The real joke is the transparency of the potent merchandising tie-ins. Will the Rapunzel doll revive the 1970s Barbie ""With Growin Pretty Hair?"" Will Flynn take Kens role as male arm candy which is more or less his job in ""Tangled""? Will there be ""Tangled"" hair extensions? ""Tangled"" shampoo? ""Tangled"" PG for mild violence. 1 hour 40 minutes. Voices of Mandy Moore Zachary Levi M.C. Gainey Donna Murphy and Brad Garrett; directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard.

She considers herself a cloistered middle-class girl. Disneys over that la-di-dah simpering; they want a beauty who can clonk a guy with a frying pan. Which Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) does the first time she meets Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) and with good reason. Hes a cocky thief whos just broken into her secret tower--more proof that all the good ones are taken. (Though Prince Charming would probably be a jerk if Snow White and Cinderella had bothered to get to know him better.) If anything Tangled is hommepowerment--one more step forward in Disneys slow march to treat male suitors like equals from its early nameless princes to the passing characterization of Princes Phillip and Eric in Sleeping Beauty and The Little Mermaid to here a dude with a full-on personality and nearly equal screen time. The flick itself is winningly formulaic down to this DisneyBot 2010s cute animal sidekick (a lizard--but its the snotty horse who steals the show). In 3D the animators do amazing things with Rapunzels hair sending it winging around the walls like liquid gold. And after she braids it up with flowers to blend into the masses mothers across the country will steel themselves for their daughters whining to have their hair fixed like that for school. Those moms will need to watch their step. The villain here is Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) who like the German fairy tale has stolen the girl as a baby and raised her as her own. To keep her in the tower shes raised her to be insecure and timid like a helicopter mom who wont let her 16-year-old get a license. Their push-pull dynamic is the thrust of the movie--how hard is it to beware the woman who coos ""I loves you""--and makes the flick feel more modern than were used to from a Disney flick like a meaty episode of Dr. Phil disguised in a chirpy cartoon.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 24 2010 Save for later Saved Rapunzel voiced by Mandy Moore and Flynn voiced by Zachary Levi are shown in a scene from the animated feature Tangled. Disney Enterprises Inc./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Once upon a time the Disney 3-D animated movie musical ""Tangled"" was going to be called ""Rapunzel."" But then the big bad ""Princess and the Frog"" had disappointing grosses and studio executives worried that maybe having ""princess"" in the title of a movie was too girly. Im still old-school enough to believe that ""Rapunzel"" is a fine title for a movie about well Rapunzel - although kids (or their parents) unfamiliar with the original Brothers Grimm fairy tale might mistake it for the name of a German techno-rock band or a gluten-free pretzel.As Disney animated features go ""Tangled"" is middling. Mandy Moore voices the girl with the 70-foot-long golden hair who is locked away in a tower in the forest with only a pet chameleon for a companion. Handsome suitors and wicked witches arrive on cue. A splash of blood at the end earned the film a PG rating but its about as scary as a spilled can of tomato paste. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? With any luck ""Tangled"" wont morph into a Broadway show. If it does they should do the right thing and call it ""Rapunzel."" Grade C+ (Rated PG for brief mild violence.)

(Walt Disney Pictures) Tangled Limp humor weak songs mar Disneys Tangled BY JOE WILLIAMS gt; Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Nov 24 2010 (...) Walt Disney Pictures Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is rescued from her tower by a young thief voiced by Zachary Levi. (Walt Disney Pictures) In the new century the animators at Disney have been pressured from two sides -- by their pals at Pixar whove taken Disney style and storytelling to another level and by their competitors at DreamWorks whose ""Shrek"" series dragged sappy cartoon cliches into the swamp. The revisionist fairy tale ""Tangled"" is an in-between response to the new wave of animation. This 3-D feature has a glossy sheen and girly curlicues but too often the limp humor and oily songs make it seem like a bad hair day.A flippant voiceover introduces us to enchanted young Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) whose golden hair has the power of healing and immortality. Abducted from her royal parents by a vain old woman named Gothel (Donna Murphy) Rapunzel and her magic tresses are locked in a remote tower. As her 18th birthday approaches she dreams that she might be allowed outside for the day to watch the annual cascade of stars -- which are actually lanterns set aloft by her grieving parents. But in one of the brassy Broadway-targeted tunes that give the movie a mercenary undertone Gothel insists that mother knows best. Enter Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) a dashing thief on the lam from some covetous cronies. When Flynn seeks refuge in the tower hes the first man that Rapunzel has ever seen so she whacks him with a frying pan and stashes his satchel of stolen jewels. But the scalawag promises that in exchange for the loot he will show Rapunzel the world. There are a lot of plot opportunities in Rapunzels late awakening and usually the movie skews toward contemporary wisecracks and rubbery slapstick some of it involving Flynns stubborn horse and Rapunzels protective pet chameleon. A brief scene where the denizens of a tavern turn out to be artistic softies is the most memorable thing in the film. But when the big-eyed heroine tries to tug at our heartstrings and Flynn turns into Prince Charming the too-familiar hero-and-damsel motif feels like a fashion faux-pas. And despite the beautifully rendered palace and its lantern ceremony Rapunzels parents are almost an afterthought.""Tangled"" is lovely to look at but if youre not a pre-teen girl you may be distracted by the split ends.

Zachery Levi and Mandy Moore star in Rapunzel. Photo Disney Tangled 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Rapunzel Rapunzel let down your hair Like now. Because a really cute guy just scaled the wall to your tower and your goth-looking mom is off running an errand. So go ahead loop one end of your 70-odd feet of enchanted golden tresses through that useful hook on the ledge lower the rest of your hair out the window and then shimmy down rappelling yourself to freedom Not sure why this escape technique never occurred to you before -- maybe you wanted to avoid split ends? And dont worry about the guy hes a gifted rock climber. Seriously hell scale down with pitons. There. Now that youre free for the first time in forever you and Flynn - thats his name and hes a thief - can go off and sing in a bar with Vikings at least until its time to escape through tunnels into an abandoned mining town. Thats not how things unfold in the old Grimm fairy tale but this is Tangled Rapunzel which means its Disney which means the details have been tweaked by a co-writer and co-director of Bolt. In the original for instance you werent a princess (sorry). That guy Flynn? Hes supposed to be a prince (again sorry). And Im afraid the original didnt feature any songs by Alan Menken who wrote the music for Aladdin and Pocahontas and a bunch of other Disney movies including the one about Patrick Dempseys hair. There arent that many songs this time - just a handful reprised ad infinitum. You get to sing most of them so Im sure youve noticed how bland they are. (Is that your real voice or is it Mandy Moores? Your mom sounds like Broadway star Donna Murphy. And Flynn I swear he could be Zachary Levi from Chuck. Dude can sing.) Most of your adventures are bland too although that tipsy Cupid in diapers seems like decent company and the palace horse with the flaring nostrils - hes stone cool. Oh and nice use of frying pans in hand-to-hand combat. Your mother yikes. She is one clingy piece of work and Id say that even if she werent a hideous crone who snatched you from your crib. You seem to think its your fault shes been hyper-parenting and holing you up in a fortified monolith all these years. Listen Breck Girl You are not a horrible daughter. As Flynn says ""Overprotective mother forbidden road trip. ... You just gotta do it"" Hes always quick with an inspirational zinger have you noticed? But that sensitive chin fur and the way he talks out of the side of his mouth - makes him look like Dick Cheney at a poetry slam. Otherwise you two make an adorable couple all dolled up and flouncing about the kingdom in glorious computerized 3-D. I was most enchanted by those graceful floating lamps that waft through the deep night sky. Look one almost fell in my lap Could a happily ever after (or maybe a new ride at the Magic Kingdom) be far behind? Rapunzel Rapunzel you are lovely to look at it and occasionally charming.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 24 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 311PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English One of many things gleaned from reading Neal Gablers dense brisk and illuminating biography Walt Disney The Triumph of the American Imagination is that several animated adaptations of fairy tales worked upon in the studios early days never left the drawing board. The story of Rapunzel - you know the gal with really really long hair who is imprisoned in a tower and found by a prince - hit the boards in the 1940s shortly after Snow White had her screen debut. But they obviously had difficulty figuring out how to get Rapunzel out of that tower and expand the tales tendrils so to speak. Until now. Movies Tangled The official trailer Tangled Disneys 50th animated feature is a splendid tribute to the best moments from decades past but also a thrilling example of what could be the future of animated family entertainment from the studio. They really pulled out all the stops on this one. Tangled is glorious-looking action-packed and laugh-rippled with a few fine story-advancing musical numbers. Its a lively rendition of Rapunzel that swaps the social status of the two romantic protagonists turns the old evil hag into a svelte passive-aggressive mother-type and adds two new animal characters (a cute chameleon who perches like so many twittering birds in cartoons of yore and a fearless cop horse with the tenacity of a sniffer dog) that only Disney animators could so memorably portray. The painterly look of hand-drawn animation from Disneys first golden era and the physicality of the best swashbuckling adventure films of that same time are delivered with the latest techniques in camera positioning editing special effects and 3-D to enhance the action to heart-pounding effect underline gags and create romance. The storys narrator and a main source of action humour and eventually romance is Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). Instead of a Brothers Grimm prince we get this rakish thief a bad boy (but with hero potential) obviously designed to keep the young male audience from spurning yet another princess movie. And hes up for the task. In a long action sequence Flynn steals a jewelled crown from the castle eludes the kings guards in an exciting forest chase and tumbles off a cliff into a deep chasm wherein lies a tall remote tower - the perfect place to escape his pursuers and stash the loot until things cool down. But gong Hes knocked out with a frying pan before he even lays eyes on the beautiful but not-so-helpless Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) with 20 metres of golden hair that almost seems like a living character. At this point weve learned Rapunzels backstory. Shes a princess (in the Grimm version shes the daughter of peasants) abducted as a baby and raised in confinement by Mother Gothel (Broadway star Donna Murphy) because her hair has the magical power to heal the sick and - pertinent to her captor - restore youth so long as it isnt cut. Tangleds writer and co-directors made their feature debuts with Disneys Cars and Bolt movies about non-human characters and set in contemporary or pseudo-contemporary times. Nevertheless these guys are clearly steeped in studio tradition conjuring up a rich pseudo-medieval environment and only rarely turning to current pop-culture references for a laugh or a jolt. Yet they are also right in tune with modern psychology. In particular the relationship between Rapunzel and the only mother shes ever known is the model of a co-dependent bond with Murphys show-stopper Mother Knows Best hilariously conveying the fear and guilt that have kept Rapunzel in the tower of her own free will. But of course Tangled finally gets the maiden out of jail. With her fake mother away and a handsome stranger literally tied up in her hair Rapunzel finds the nerve to realize her only dream - to visit the source of the dazzling lights that rise in the night sky once a year on her birthday. When her toes finally hit the grass its a delicious moment of joy mixed with guilt. Flynn escorts her on a perilous journey through the forest where naturally they encounter all kinds of fun characters including a bunch of Viking-like toughs who soften (and break into a song reminiscent of former Disney tunesmiths the Sherman brothers) thanks to Rapunzels charms. A shining example of all-around family entertainment Tangled draws you in with its traditional roots and keeps you captivated by its thoroughly modern enchantments.

Photo (c)Walt Disney Co./courtesy Everet Disneys 50th animated feature ""Tangled"" is a solid if not-quite-classic musical version of ""Rapunzel"" which the Mouse House has retitled in a likely unsuccessful attempt to lure preteen boys. In this variation Rapunzel fits squarely into Disneys long line of princesses kidnapped as a baby from her royal parents by the witch Gothel who locks her in a tower. The magic flower that saved Rapunzels mother from death has endowed the daughters long locks with magical properties. Besides being able to use her hair as a ladder for her captor who pretends to be her mother when Rapunzel sings the strands glow allowing Gothel to remain eternally young and beautiful. As Disney princesses will Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) yearns for something different in her opening song -- ""When Will My Life Begin?"" But songwriters Alan Menken (""Beauty and the Beast"") and Glenn Slater give the real showstopper to Broadway belter Donna Murphy as Gothel -- a warning to Rapunzel called ""Mother Knows Best."" The storys traditional prince has been replaced by a dashing thief named Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi of TVs ""Chuck""). Fleeing after stealing a crown from Rapunzels parents he stumbles into her tower -- and the two sneak off while Gothel plots to engineer Rapunzels return. One of the films best sequences is set in a tavern filled with criminal types who break into song -- and help the couple escape from royal pursuers. The pursuers are led by a (nonspeaking) stallion who has more personality unfortunately than our heroes. Visually this toon is all over the place. Rapunzels glowing hair can look alarmingly like fiber-optic cable but some backgrounds are the computer-generated equivalents of Disneys golden-age work. A scene in which thousands of lanterns float in the sky may be the years best use of 3-D -- while in other places those stereoscopic glasses mainly serve to dim the brightly colored visuals of ""Tangled.""

Tangled (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Tangled (PG) The fairy tale gets a reworking in this terrific toon Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/24/2010 Editor rating 3 The delightfully witty Tangled is the first animated cartoon released by Walt Disney Pictures that can stand alongside Pixar toons without apology. Working from an ingenious screenplay by Dan Fogelman that turns the Grimm Brothers fairy tale about Rapunzel into a rollicking adventure directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard  strike a perfect balance with high-flying action musical numbers a genuinely touching romance and a baddie worthy of a place in Disneys Hallowed Hall of Villains. Aside from the heroine (voiced by Mandy Moore) and her impossibly long blonde hair the particulars of the story have all been changed. The girl is a princess kidnapped as a baby by an old hag Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) who uses the magical powers of Rapunzels tresses - they glow with a regenerative healing light when she sings - to keep herself young. Mother Gothel keeps Rapunzel locked away inside a tower warning her that the outside world is too treacherous and dangerous. Resigned to her fate the good-natured girl entertains herself with games baking and her scene-stealing pet chameleon. But on the eve of her 18th birthday she gets an unexpected visit from Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) a fugitive thief who overcomes the young womans suspicions and agrees to take her out of the tower and into the surrounding forest. Tangled starts out in somewhat rote Disney fashion but unlike last years The Princess and the Frog which was formulaic to a fault it gradually develops a distinct identity with some terrific supporting characters (including a kings horse in relentless pursuit of Flynn) and some eye-popping sequences from a giant flood to a heartbreakingly beautiful display of candles floating in the nighttime sky under which Rapunzel and Flynn fall into proper love. Like the best Pixar films Tangled understands that the key to any good movie -- animated or not -- depends on the audiences attachment to the characters. Spectacle and music are secondary. Even though they may seem to be boilerplate fairy-tale heroes you genuinely come to care about Rapunzel and Flynn and root for them to be together -- an outcome that although guaranteed from the start still manages to seem in doubt. The films 3D effects are not obtrusive the artistry is at times breathtaking and the movie leaves you feeling giddy with happiness and glee. Tangled packs old-fashioned Disney magic as endless as Rapunzels locks. Voices Mandy Moore Zachary Levi Donna Murphy Ron Perlman M.C. Gainey Jeffrey Tambor. Directors Nathan Greno Byron Howard.

ABOUT THE MOVIETangled    (out of four) Voices Mandy Moore Zachary Levi Donna Murphy Brad Garrett Ron Perlman Jeffrey TamborDirectors Nathan Greno and Byron HowardDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for brief mild violenceRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Tangled braids strands of traditional storytelling and a contemporary sensibility with stylish if predictable results. The scripts sassy humor and the casts vocal charm bring to jaunty life a flimsy Grimms fairy tale. It tries for the appeal of Disneys animation heyday but individual scenes borrow a bit too liberally from such movies as Beauty and the Beast The Little Mermaid and Aladdin. It all feels very familiar. TRAILER Comb through this preview of Tangled Mandy Moore plays the spunky-sweet long-haired Rapunzel who grows up confined to a tower thanks to the conniving Mother Gothel (a vocal scene-stealing Donna Murphy) who she believes is her overprotective mother. Truth is she was born a princess to a queen whose mysterious illness was cured by a magic flower. That restorative magic was transferred to baby Rapunzel. Her glowing hair contains a huge perk eternal youth. The little princess spends only a few days in the palace before Mother Gothel absconds with her human Fountain of Youth. We meet Rapunzel as an artsy teenager who age-appropriately yearns to break out of her confined existence. Of course she breaks into song. Her signature number is nothing like that indelible opening scene in Beauty and the Beast even though it tries to be. Luckily for Rapunzel along comes this fairy tales most wanted the dashing Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) a bandit whom Rapunzel takes hostage. The two embark on an adventure and as is Disneys tradition anthropomorphized animals fill in the personality that the leads sometimes lack. The computer-generated animation is designed to look hand-drawn. With its vibrant color palette there are some vividly beautiful images most impressive of which is the release of hundreds of floating lanterns. Though the humor is uneven the funniest segment takes place in a woodsy pub. It blends zany Monty Python-style humor with the seminal scene in Beauty and the Beast involving Gaston and Le Fou -- not surprising since Beauty composer Alan Mencken co-wrote the original songs. As Disney princesses go Rapunzel is more believable in her teenage histrionics taking the audience along on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. After disobeying strict orders not to leave the tower she flits between spasms of guilt and rapturous glee. Moments like this and the pub scene seem to offer a wink bending the Disney formula in the same gently satirical direction that Shrek did. And yet the sensibility is muddled as the sarcastic Mother Gothel plays the role of Rapunzels loving mom sometimes convincingly. Though not exactly innovative Tangled has a snappy pace and the Broadway-style appeal of classic Disney fare.

"Tangled review Disney returns to its magical roots with this golden girl |       NJ.com comments Tangled review Disney returns to its magical roots with this golden girl Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 23 2010 at 807 AM View/Post Comments DISNEY Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Flynn (Zachary Levi) in Disneys new CGI-animated feature ""Tangled."" ""Tangled"" the new holiday movie from Disney is crammed full of the latest cartoon musts including computer animation and of course eye-popping 3-D. Yet it also seems sweetly blissfully old-fashioned. Yes its based on a fairy tale -- the story of Rapunzel actually. But unlike the ""Shrek"" series (and imitators like ""Hoodwinked"") its not built for pop-culture gags and adult irony. Instead ""Tangled"" very deliberately invokes Disneys Second Golden Age when movies like ""The Little Mermaid ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" wed childrens stories to sophisticated artwork and big Broadway-style soundtracks. The recent ""The Princess and the Frog"" tried that tack too and even threw in hand-drawn animation -- without success. Movie Review TANGLED (PG) Disney (104 min.) Directed by Nathan Greno Byron Howard. With the voices of Mandy Moore Zachary Levi Donna Murphy. Opens Wendesday in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains cartoon violence. Stephen Whittys Review THREE AND A HALF STARS But it tried a little too hard spending so much effort on forcibly joining an old fable with a New Orleans background that it forgot the beauty and the humor. ""Tangled"" remembers both as it tells the story of a golden-haired girl stolen away by a haggard crone -- she could be the younger sister of the witch in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" -- whos realized the childs tresses restore health and beauty. And as long as Rapunzel stays locked away with her in a tower this raven-haired monster will stay forever young. This is of course the point at which a ""Shrek"" movie might start trotting out the Cher jokes. But ""Tangled"" instead gives the domineering female a big show tune ""Mother Knows Best."" And then brings in a handsome rogue to rescue our fair damsel. DISNEYRapunzel (Mandy Moore) and Maximus in Disneys new CGI-animated feature ""Tangled."" Rapunzel you see is also a lost royal. (This is a Disney movie after all and they do have to keep building that princess franchise.) But she also turns out to be a fairly capable young woman too. And together she and her hero make a pretty good team. Hes named Flynn by the way and may remind parents or grandparents of a similar hero circa 1937s ""The Prince and the Pauper."" But thats where the show-biz in-jokes end. Unlike other cartoons which drag in everybody from Katie Couric to Larry King for vocal cameos (and hopes perhaps of later free publicity) ""Tangled"" concentrates on actors who are right for their parts. Mandy Moore makes a very sweet Rapunzel; Zachary Levi from ""Chuck"" is a surprisingly perfect choice for the self-mocking Flynn. And Broadways own Donna Murphy is terrific as Rapunzels conniving ""mother"" a crafty kidnapper with a heart of brass. Shes both hissable and hummable and if ""Tangled"" hasnt morphed into a Broadway show within five years then Disney isnt as smart as I think it is. And that includes being smart enough to let Pixar be Pixar with its own line of witty sophisticated cartoons -- while realizing that sometimes just being Disney is pretty great too.

Wednesday November 24 2010 at 4 a.m. By Dan Kois EXPAND ""Great"" sighs the wicked witch in Tangled a CG-animated spin on the Rapunzel story ""now Im the bad guy."" Mother Gothel the frizzy-haired sharp-featured enchantress with the inimitable voice of Donna Murphy is Disneys first villainess whose chief crime is being an underminer and the heroine of Disneys 50th animated film its first co-dependent princess. Tween girls may have some tough questions for their moms on the way out of the funny brassy Tangled ""Hey how come Mother Gothel said the same things about Rapunzels weight that you say to me?"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Those moms might answer as Murphy does in her finest number ""Mother Knows Best"" a Mama Rose-worthy tune (by famed Disney composer Alan Menken with lyrics by Glenn Slater) in which the witch--who kidnapped the magical Rapunzel as a toddler so that her long blond hair might keep Gothel forever young--explains all the reasons why Rapunzel doesnt want to leave the tower on her 18th birthday. Sure there are ""ruffians thugs poison ivy quicksand""--but the real problem Gothel tells the girl is that Rapunzel is too silly too uneducated too unsophisticated to survive the trip.Of course when Rapunzel finally does get out--in the company of good-hearted thief Flynn--shes a mess. The films wittiest sequence cuts between Rapunzels emotional highs (feeling grass under her feet for the first time ever) and lows (""Im a terrible daughter"") to great comic effect. Tangled is unusually attuned to the emotional frequencies of mothers and daughters considering that like basically every Disney/Pixar feature its writer (Dan Fogelman) and directors (Nathan Greno and Byron Howard) are a bunch of dudes.When it strays from its filial drama Tangled is mostly unsurprising though not without its charms. Rapunzel and Flynn are just as vanilla as their respective voice actors--Mandy Moore and Chucks Zachary Levi. Rapunzel gets a traditional Disney ""I Want"" song but where Beauty and the Beasts Belle wanted more than her provincial life Rapunzel doesnt even know what life is yet--hers is titled ""When Does My Life Begin?"" As for Flynn hes all pratfalls and wisecracks--""I dont do backstory"" he advises when asked about his childhood--with floppy hair and (naturally) a late-breaking sensitive side.The movies real accomplishments are in its look which was generated inside a computer but is as warm and rich as a painting. Rapunzels endless blond locks must have been a nightmare to program--the credits cite a Hair Animation Lead who earned every penny--but the movie uses that hair (as swing as obstacle as weapon) to great effect in its lively action sequences. Rapunzel and Flynns romantic interlude is lit by a thousand floating lanterns; while Tangleds 3-D is mostly unobtrusive the lights swooping over the audience might be the most crowd-pleasing three-dimensional filigree Ive yet seen. If the movies a hit expect a nightly floating lantern show at the Magic Kingdom by summer 2011.Sadly though Disneys been undercutting poor Tangled just as badly as Mother Gothel does her charge. Stung by the middling box office of last years The Princess and the Frog the Mouse scotched this pictures original title Rapunzel and launched a lousy ad campaign stressing the movies rugged leading man (and shying away from the songs). It wont work of course; boys will smell the movies princess-y perfume a mile away and stay away in droves.With its fairy-tale origins and its Menken score Tangled reaches for the heights of the companys early-90s masterpieces Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid. But its a shame that Disney cant embrace Tangleds charms and that an audience full of appreciative girls may not be enough anymore.1 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Dan Kois Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Tangled Knot your average Disney toon | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTangled Knot your average Disney toonTangled is a giddy departure from the likes of Snow White Pinocchio The Lady and the Tramp and other childhood favorites.Maximus the horse Pascal the chameleon and Rapunzel in a scene from Disneys animation Tangled. (DISNEY ENTERPRISES)  Flynn Rapunzel and the chameleon Pascal in a scene from Disneys animation Tangled.  (DISNEY ENTERPRISES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Nov. 23 2010Tangled (out of 4)Animated comedy featured the voices of Mandy Moore Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy. Directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard. At theatres throughout the GTA. 100 minutes.Disney is trumpeting Tangled as its 50th animated feature which seems an odd boast considering how hard these pin-striped Mouseketeers are seeking to break from tradition.Tangled is a giddy departure from the likes of Snow White Pinocchio The Lady and the Tramp and other childhood favourites where princesses puppets and pooches sweetly await certain happiness from benevolent figures.Article Continued BelowThis one is cynical sarcastic and makes no promise of rescue or redemption. The heroine is a frypan-swinging athlete who has a slimy chameleon for a pet. The hero is a conman and thief. Not that theres anything wrong with that -- in fact theres a lot thats right about it.Even the title runs counter to Disney convention being something youd expect more from its Toontown rivals at DreamWorks or Pixar. The film adapts Rapunzel the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about a fair maiden in a high tower who uses her flowing locks as an eco-friendly escalator.All of which is to say that if you seek the gentler Disney fare of yore when all you had to do was wish upon a star or whistle while you worked then Tangled may not be your cup o stardust.If youre seeking more modern thrills or laughs however then grab a lock and hang on.Tangled features the poppy and peppy Mandy Moore as Rapunzel a character no longer Grimm but certainly vexed. As an infant shes abducted from her cradle by the desperate woman known as Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) who is suspiciously Cher-like in her quest for eternal youth.She believes shes found magic in the golden follicles of Rapunzel who must forever be her tower slave. Until the day comes when brazen adventurer Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi of TVs Chuck) finagles his way into Rapunzels life and all heck breaks loose.She clocks him with a frying pan suspicious of his intentions. Then she realizes he could be her ticket out of the tower and into a viewing of the magical airborne lanterns that occur each day on her birthday. Adventure ho And much of it is quite funny well scripted by screenwriter Dan Fogelman who previously wrote Bolt and Cars. Co-directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who also have Bolt on their resumes keep the action urgent and make the 3-D seem unnecessary.Theres a wealth of secondary characters found in the not-so-tough guys who aid Rapunzel and who are good enough to almost merit their own movie.Songs composed by Disney regular Alan Menken working with lyricist Glenn Slater are enjoyable if not very memorable.Neither they nor Tangled rank amongst the best things that Disney has ever offered. Nevertheless the movie is a welcome breath of fresh air for a story and a company too long cooped up in an ivory tower.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Disney) Joe Neumaier Tuesday November 23 2010 449 PM Title Tangled Long-haired Rapunzel and a thief escape a villainess. With the voices of Mandy Moore Zachary Levi. Directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard (140). PG. At area theaters.Disneys ""Tangled"" is about lifes journeys not its destinations -- and that makes all the difference. A Rapunzel retelling could have become just a retread of the studios past princess tales but this genuinely charming chintz-free story does something new It takes the time to chill out as its heroine might say.Except for Pixars perfections almost all CG-animated films zip around like toddlers on a sugar high. So ""Tangleds"" thoughtful pace and sweet heart make it perfect for girls 5 to 8 -- an underserved audience -- as well as tweens who dont want unnecessary pop songs meta-riffs or mega-explosions in every movie.This is an elegant film that begins once upon a time as a royal couple are expecting a daughter. After the queen drinks the juice of a magic flower her child is born with hair containing restorative powers. But a vain old woman named Mother Gothel steals her from her crib and isolates her in a tower. As the girl grows fearful of the outside world her tresses are never cut and Gothel remains mysteriously youthful.Nearing 18 Rapunzel yearns to see the world but Gothel forbids it. A thief on the run Flynn Ryder helps her escape and the two head off to see the beautiful floating lanterns the king and queen release into the air every year on their daughters birthday. No one including the girl herself knows where or who she is.There are laughs involving soft-hearted scoundrels and Rapunzels silent chameleon sidekick yet directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard keep the tale grounded with tension coming from the inherently dramatic mother-daughter dynamic. The super-coiffed artist-adventurer (voiced by Mandy Moore) and the narcissistic villain (deliciously mischievous Donna Murphy) occasionally feel guilt or loneliness which adds depth without ruining the fun. Rapunzel and Flynns (Zachary Levi) romance is cute but this is a movie about finding yourself.Which makes the movie a spiritual sister to ""Beauty and the Beast"" -- thoroughly modern Rapunzel does most of the saving -- with gorgeous old-school Disney vistas and witty songs from Alan Menken (""The Little Mermaid"").There could have been more side trips on the road to self-discovery but the plentiful lessons and derring-do make ""Tangled"" a lock for playground pastimes. And maybe even some knotty parent-kid chats about finding your part in life.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

(Disney Enterprises Inc. via AP) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / November 24 2010 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Disneys animation wing -- the one thats not Pixar -- seems newly defensive. For instance its hand-drawn ""Princess and the Frog from last year had a mostly black cast. The movie worked. Still it said ""See? We do black royalty too""Tangled which sugars spices and 3-Ds the tale of ""Rapunzel feels even more on edge. Its computer-generated but seems almost ashamed of how old-fashioned it is. When Rapunzel (the voice of Mandy Moore) or Rapunzels mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) breaks into song the movie insists on sight gags or a jokey lyric.Alan Menken the star composer who wrote ""Under the Sea for ""The Little Mermaid and ""A Whole New World for ""Aladdin cowrote the songs in ""Tangled. One of them about why Rapunzel mustnt ever leave her tower is called ""Mother Knows Best. And even as you admire how exasperatingly good Menken remains at his job (its been weeks and I can still hear the melodies) theres a droop to these numbers. The movie doesnt need them for one thing. For another their archness (Gothel sings with a forearm to her forehead) suggests that the filmmakers want to have it both ways -- to be sincere and to sneer. The musical bits sag with uncertainty. The whole movie does.The problem is that Disney with Menkens inspired assistance mocked its animated classics a few years ago with ""Enchanted a live-action farce that actually did manage to have it two ways. The movie jested but that title turned out to be apt too. ""Tangled sadly is also a title that makes sense. The company wants to go back to the way things were but doesnt seem to believe it entirely can. The animators might rather be out doing ""Megamind or ""Toy Story 3 but theyre stuck with princess movies.Their Rapunzel is enjoyably cabin-fevered. Its been years with no computer mobile device or friend. (She seems however one Taylor Swift album away from being self-actualized.) All she really has is a pet chameleon and an undermining overly dramatic mother whos always running off to Lord knows where-- an educated guess would be to the nearest production of Stephen Sondheims ""Into the Woods. When a conceited bandit (Zachary Levi) hides in her tower she gets a reluctant sidekick wholl eventually fall in love with her.The storys tension -- Rapunzel began life as a Grimm Brothers creation -- resides in whether shell break free of Gothels ""Carrie-like grip and discover how enchanted she is. Thats dull. All the best ideas here are visual -- theyve made Rapunzels 70 feet and 80 pounds of flaxen hair operate in hilarious defiance of physics. The movie has a field day with thousands of airborne lanterns a troop of Neanderthal thugs (one is a mime) some surprisingly fleet camerawork and good editing. I cant think of a cartoon more confident about how to use jump cuts for comedy. Those senses of cleverness and innovation merely underscore how shopworn the rest of this movie is.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In a recent L.A. Times article Walt Disney/Pixar Animation Studios president Ed Catmull confirmed that Tangled--Disneys 50th animated feature--is the studios last fairy tale for the foreseeable future. The media is billing it as the end of an era bookended by the studios first animated feature Snow White and filled with many other conceptually similar musical retellings of traditional tales all centering on a princess a romantic interest and an adventure that leads them to love. But in spite of its pedigree Tangled doesnt come across as a traditional Disney film certainly not in the spirit of 2009s conscious old-school throwback The Princess And The Frog. Its a rambunctious modern story full of chases smart banter big emotions and palpable darkness. It feels like a Pixar product--no great wonder since Catmull and Disney/Pixar creative director John Lasseter restarted the film almost from scratch in 2008 to fit their proven sensibilities. The only hints of old Disney come in the tropes the striking Alan Menken-composed songs and some noticeable borrowing from past hits. Pop star Mandy Moore voices Rapunzel the long-haired girl trapped in the familiar tower. But in this retelling her overprotective mother (magnificently voiced by Tony-winning Broadway star Donna Murphy) has a new set of motivations Rapunzels hair has magical properties which Murphys character jealously guards by manipulating Rapunzel into a state of confused frightened dependence. Nonetheless like so many Disney heroines past Rapunzel wants to see the great outside world--really to escape mom and come of age--so she sneaks off enlisting the help of a smug rakish thief (voiced by Chuck star Zachary Levi) to escort and protect her on her journey. The story should be a standard mismatched-couple-falls-in-love tale but the script (by Bolt co-writer Dan Fogelman) and the sprightly directing (by Bolts co-director Byron Howard and its story head Nathan Greno) give the story plenty of snap and humor and the animation is so luminously beautiful that even a falling-in-love sequence cribbed in part from The Little Mermaid is overwhelmingly magical. Even the 3-D is exceptional a rarity in an increasingly crowded 3-D field. The characters appear rounded shadowed and clearly removed from the backgrounds; in 3-D they almost pop off the screen giving every frame a startling depth. But as with Pixar features the impressive draw of the animation still comes second to winning nuanced characters and to well-developed characters and relationships. Everything here is a too-familiar Disney formula but one done right. If it does turn out to be Disneys last fairy-tale film (though if this one makes money theres no reason to believe the studio wont eventually return to the formula that made its name) its certainly a respectable coda.

Plus its pretty. By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune November 24 2010 -- 345pm Video (0427)  Colin Covert doesnt have many bad things to say about Disneys Rapunzel remake. In fact this may be the best animation the company has released. Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint I dont feel like writing a review of ""Tangled."" I feel like throwing it a parade. This Disney makeover of ""Rapunzel"" is a joyous gorgeous glorious extravaganza. The animation is as bouncy as a tetherball the script is a winning blend of satire and schmaltz. And Mandy Moore who supplies the long-haired lass vocals has a voice that caresses your ear like a cashmere mitten. Where can I get a street permit and hire a marching band? Deconstructing familiar legends is standard procedure in this post-""Shrek"" era but ""Tangled"" is so fresh and boisterous in tweaking fairy tale cliches that it feels novel. The film produced by Pixar founder John Lasseter braids the once-upon-a-time romanticism of Disney tradition with a quick-witted modern sensibility. ""Tangled"" gives us the studios first digitally animated princess a roguish bandit antihero and humor with a sassy edge. It is rated PG downright risque for the Mouse House. In this retelling Rapunzel is stolen from her royal parents by Gothel (Broadway veteran Donna Murphy) a crone who uses the tower-bound teens golden hair to remain youthful forever. In her own way Gothel is scarier than Snow Whites wicked stepmother. She doesnt cast spells; shes fully capable of manipulating guilt-tripping and emotionally undermining the girl who has grown up believing this malicious Medusa is her mother. Still like any grounded-for-life teen Rapunzel dreams of escape. She gets her wish when highwayman Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi of TVs ""Chuck"") climbs up to evade the law. Hes a vain charismatic scoundrel exasperated that his portrait on ""Wanted"" posters never gets his aquiline nose right. Over the course of terrific adventures the cocky outlaw teaches her about courage and she curbs his scofflaw ways by repeatedly clocking him on the skull with her frying pan. The female and male characters are equally strong and funny a hallmark of ""Tangleds"" harmonious design. The movie keeps swashbuckling action and Alan Menken character songs in perfect balance gently lampooning both. By rights the two strands of material ought to be incompatible. Instead theyre delightful. When Rapunzel sings about her dreams the old familiar Disney bluebird of happiness flutters by -- repeatedly. Later a pub full of knaves and brutes burst into song to describe their own fantasies. Rider is relentlessly pursued by Maximus a palace guards gruff superhero horse. With their fractious free-for-alls and endless one-upmanship theyre a classic comedy duo. ""Tangled"" has impressive visual appeal from the warm Mediterranean glow of the landscapes to the handsome character designs. A romantic boat ride beneath a constellation of floating lanterns is one of the more breathtaking episodes of gratuitous beauty this side of ""Avatars"" phosphorescent forest. A thunderous dam collapse and flood is strikingly vivid and exciting. ""Tangled"" is pretty enough for girls lively enough for boys and clever enough for older wiser audiences. Dont even think of missing this one.

"Movie review Disneys Tangled - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie review Tangled Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic For ""Tangled"" the studios 50th feature-length cartoon the team at Disney has taken a deep breath and tried to be all things to all animation-loving people. There are some hiccups along the way but by the end there is success.Whether you like stirring adventure or sentimental romance traditional fairy tales or stories of modern families musicals or comedies even blonds or brunets ""Tangled"" has something for you. Sampling so many animation touchstones has its risks but once ""Tangled"" calms down and accepts the essential sweetness of its better nature the rewards are clear. As directed by Nathan Greno and ""Bolt"" co-director Byron Howard one of those rewards is a gorgeous computer-animated look that features rich landscapes and characters that look fuller and more lifelike than they have in the past.""Tangled"" can be forgiven if it takes some time to find its footing. It is after all a story of a lost princess that does a lot to appeal to boys a retelling of the Rapunzel fairy tale that (in this country at least) decided it was wiser to avoid the name itself and a movie with five Alan Menken songs that doesnt call itself a musical. That initial shakiness is amplified by the irritating and overly glib nature of co-protagonist Flynn Rider (voiced by Zachary Levi) a devil-may-care bandit who is introduced spewing more smart remarks than a Comedy Store regular. Like a refugee from a "" Shrek"" sequel Flynn calls Rapunzel ""blondie"" and says ""I dont do back story"" when asked about his past.This comment notwithstanding it is Flynn who fills us in on Rapunzels history. The daughter of a king and queen (honest) she was spirited away as an infant and raised by a devious woman named Mother Gothel (brassy theater veteran Donna Murphy) who keeps the girl in the dark about her real parents and locks her up in a tower because contact with Rapunzels magical hair keeps Mother G. eternally young.As envisioned by Disney hair technicians Xinmin Zhao and Kelly Ward (who devoted 10 years of her life and a PhD thesis to pondering how to computer animate hair) that mane is quite the force of nature 70 feet long and capable of many things including tying people up and batting them down.Rapunzel it should be emphasized is hardly defined by her hair. As voiced by former tween idol Mandy Moore this is a very modern young woman about to turn 18 and with only a wise chameleon (is there any other kind?) named Pascal as companion especially anxious to get out of the tower and see the world. What Rapunzel is especially eager to see up close are a group of floating lanterns filling the sky that shes only observed from a great distance. Its the one thing she wants for her 18th birthday but for Mother Gothel anything that takes Rapunzel out of the tower is a non-starter.A guilt-tripping overprotective super-manipulative parent from hell Mother Gothel is given to saying things like ""skip the drama stay with momma."" Though given to sugarcoating her tyranny Mother Gothel declares in a weak moment ""Youre not leaving this tower ever.""Not to worry. An on-the-run Flynn Rider appears and circumstances conspire so that he agrees to take Rapunzel to see the lanterns. Though both are clearly destined for each other the movie has the good sense not to force that realization on them or us.Once Rapunzel gets out of the tower Flynn Rider thankfully calms down and the film written by Dan Fogelman with song lyrics by Glenn Slater gets both funnier and more adventurous by taking on more of Rapunzels sunny personality.The young lady charms a bossy overzealous army horse named Maximus (the films funniest character) and disarms a gang of bloodthirsty ruffians by asking them about their dreams A murderous gentleman named Hook Hand ( Brad Garrett) is as it turns out a would-be pianist who would rather be thought ""deadly for my killer show-tune medley.""Busy as it is ""Tangled"" also finds time to include enough action and adventure sequences including wild chases hairbreadth escapes and an enormous flood to allow even the fussiest small boys to feel its worth their time.It takes a bit of doing but when ""Tangleds"" core sweetness asserts itself and the film dares to wear its heart on its sleeve in a climactic scene featuring 46000 paper lanterns its been worth the wait. Mother Gothel may have a point when she insists that ""the world is dark and selfish and cruel"" but thats why were so grateful for films like this.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Music Movies Tangled (movie) Animation (genre) Gaming Donna Murphy The Animators In Tangled animals get a little worked up for their debut Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-et-tangled-20101124,0,3295301.story",200,tangled28,tangled,latimes

While it is a diverting Disney animation - the studios 50th - it lacks the emotional undercurrents of a movie from the studios Pixar division. More about Tangled >> In this musical which boasts a handful of generic songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) is the daughter of a king whose queen has endured a troubled pregnancy. Gothel (voice of Donna Murphy) an immortal sorceress provides the monarchs with a sun lily that possesses healing properties. It restores the ailing queen and gives baby Rapunzel magical golden locks. Her hair possesses the solar energy that the cronelike Gothel relies upon to maintain her immortality. So Gothel (who actually is a bit Goth in appearance Think renaissance-fair Cher) spirits Rapunzel away and hides her in a tower where the baby grows up to be a lovely girl with tresses like a Niagara of gold. Rapunzels power like Samsons is rooted in her hair. She can spin it like a lasso snap it like a bullwhip swing it like a climbing rope. (The films 3-D effects make ample use of her hairs projectile properties.) Meanwhile out in the kingdom gallivants Flynn Rider (voice of Zachary Levi) square-jawed and self-regarding. He is a burglar who with hulking accomplices steals Rapunzels crown from the palace. It is fated that the thief with the diadem meets the princess on whose head it fits. Turns out that the self-educated Rapunzel who paints and sculpts like a Florentine master and has a solid grip on literature and the sciences wields a cast-iron skillet like a knight his lance. She longs to experience the outside world but is anxious about defying Mother Gothel. However enjoyable Tangled has the feel of a film where the story was expressly tweaked to appeal to a broad demographic spectrum. With her exclamations of ""Worst daughter alive"" and ""Best day ever"" Rapunzels dialogue is more text-messagey than once-upon-a-time. This should ingratiate it to tween audiences. Younger viewers will delight in the requisite animal sidekicks Pascal a chameleon and Maximus a white stallion whose sober attempts to bring Flynn to justice are increasingly comic. Directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard keep the action moving at a clip all the better to take advantage of the 3-D capabilities and to ensure that they dont alienate the boys in the audience. Much as I enjoyed this diversion I couldnt help but think that The Princess and the Frog had better songs and (hand-painted) animation and that Mulan was a ripping adventure that didnt need tweaking to qualify as an action flick.

"Movie review Tangled an uncommonly pretty tale washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments Movie review Tangled an uncommonly pretty tale Rapunzel voiced by Mandy Moore right and Flynn voiced by Zachary Levi in a scene from the animated feature ""Tangled."" (AP/Disney) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Tuesday November 23 2010; 334 PM Almost exactly one year ago Disney made a little bit of cinema history by releasing ""The Princess and the Frog"" featuring cartoon-doms first African American princess. ""Tangled"" this years animated holiday offering from the studio may not possess the same symbolic import or rich musical score. But it provides further evidence that with live-action movies increasingly opting for naturalistic grit animation may be the last refuge for sheer unapologetic beauty. This StoryMovie review Tangled an uncommonly pretty taleWatch the trailer TangledHoliday Movie Guide 2010 Dont let the title fool you ""Tangled"" is a princess story too in this case that of Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) who as an infant is abducted from her parents castle by the vindictive Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy) and raised in a tower her hair all the time growing growing growing. And glowing glowing glowing Rapunzels super-long (and amazingly well-conditioned) tresses have magical powers that make them light up and turn back the clock for whomever they touch - namely the youth-obsessed Gothel. Rapunzels home life may be a study in passive-aggressive dysfunction but for the most part ""Tangled"" is zippy and engaging especially when the wide-eyed heroine joins forces with a cocky bandit named Flynn (Zachary Levi) - and a scene-stealing palace horse named Maximus. Reportedly the filmmakers were inspired by French Romantic painting but with its luminous azures lavenders and golds the films dazzling color palette also recalls Maxfield Parrish. The result is an uncommonly pretty visual experience especially during a climactic scene when hundreds of lanterns are sent aloft into the night sky. One thousand points of light never looked so fetching. Tangled (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for brief mild violence. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity Most Popular Twitter Activity Follow The Post Facebook Twitter View More Activity  Movie review Tangled an uncommonly pretty tale Watch the trailer Tangled Holiday Movie Guide 2010",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112304734.html,200,tangled30,tangled,washingtonpost

Thats the 411 from Tangled Disneys new (yet not quite novel) musical (yet not quite memorable) 3-D (yet so what) animated retelling of the Grimm brothers Rapunzel. Abducted from her royal parents in infancy and locked in a tower by the witchy Mother Gothel Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) sees a chance for escape when she lets down her freaky mile-long Garnier-ed tresses and up comes Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi). Flynns a thief on the run whos toting royal jewels in his satchel but in this fairy-tale world he only steals because hes basically a nice-guy underachiever who needs a better outlet for his leadership abilities. Rapunzel asks him to introduce her to the world outside. He does and they have the greatest date ever. Mother is boiling mad but too bad for her. (Shes voiced by the way by Donna Murphy a firecracker thrown into the sedate voice-over cast.) Animal pals from the Disney farm that pop up here include Flynns temperamental horse and for Rapunzel a skeptical pet frog. Not to worry theres also a Disney den of big comically dumb-looking bad guys who turn sweet when Rapunzel sings to them. Because Happily Ever After never goes out of fashion.

"Locked up Disney climbs its heroines tresses to animation renewal - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Locked up Disney climbs its heroines tresses to animation renewalTangled a 3 starsNovember 22 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticBright and engaging and blessed with two superb non-verbal non-human sidekicks ""Tangled"" certainly is more like it. For much of the last decade the Disney corporation has struggled to regain its animation mojo while one-time rival and current business partner Pixar -- and at its more sporadic best DreamWorks -- dominated the market. While no masterwork ""Tangled"" reworks the Brothers Grimm tale of Rapunzel clearly and well. Its rollicking without being pushy. After the narrative chaos of last years ""The Princess and the Frog"" its a gratifying improvement. Walt Disney himself noodled with the idea of a feature-length Rapunzel film as far back as the 1940s though its unlikely he envisioned song lyrics referring to a ""killer show tune medley"" or a heroine who deploys her magical 70-foot tresses variously as a whip a lasso and a pulley system. Though the marketing campaign hides the fact ""Tangled"" is a musical harkening back to the 90s Disney successes with a half-dozen pretty good songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater. The movies also enough of an action adventure to win over the princess mythology-resistant such as my 9-year-old son. Like me he enjoyed ""Tangled"" more than the trailers designed to sell it. Those familiar with the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine stage musical ""Into the Woods"" will recognize some of the mother/daughter issues raging in ""Tangled."" On the cusp of her 18th birthday Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) wants desperately to be let out of her tower where shes kept (though with plenty of arts-and-crafts diversions) by Mother Gothel ( Donna Murphy very plummy with the passive-aggressive evil purring intonations). The restorative powers of Rapunzels locks keep the crone forever young or young-ish. In truth Rapunzels the long-lost daughter of the king and queen and only when dashing bandit Flynn Rider ( Zachary Levi) enters Rapunzels life does the young womans destiny unfold and dreams come true and Rapunzel gets her long-awaited holiday and her nasty overprotective mother figure learns to let go the hard way. I get it I get it says Flynn as he and Rapunzel get to know each other ""Overprotective mother forbidden road trip...."" That sort of glibness extends to Flynn comporting himself like a second-rate Nickelodeon TV punk (hes a bad boy who must be tamed improved by the love of a good girl). The look of ""Rapunzel"" -- I saw the 3-D version -- is fastidious operating on a slightly antiseptically pristine palette and design heavy on the bluebell and lavender. (Its too bad I think that Rapunzel herself doesnt look more distinctively...something.) The blend of photorealistic outdoor backgrounds and doe-eyed digitally created human characters works fine as far as it goes. Is it transporting? Now and then. The film has the advantage of getting surer and more heartfelt and beautiful as it goes and the image of a thousand floating candles in the night does more than catch the eye; it nicely wraps up the plot. The real ringers though are the horse and the chameleon. The horse is Maximus one of the kings horses and hes more like a cross between a horse and a bloodhound. Very funny very noble a lovely supporting character. So is Pascal Rapunzels watchful chameleonic companion. Id see ""Tangled"" again just for those two. Saying that the film is the best Disney animation project since ""Tarzan"" more than a decade ago isnt saying much (I had no love for shrill showbiz-insider hits like ""Bolt""). But its nice to say it all the same. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for brief mild violence) Voice cast Mandy Moore (Rapunzel); Zachary Levi (Flynn Rider); Donna Murphy (Mother Gothel); Ron Perlman (Stabbington); Brad Garrett (Hook Hand); Jeffrey Tambor (Big Nose) Credits Directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard; written by Dan Fogelman; songs by Alan Menken and Glenn Slater; produced by Roy Conli.

"Tangled | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tangled ) Tangled (United States 2010) November 22 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in ""standard"" (non-IMAX) 3-D. Tangled (which was called Rapunzel until the 11th hour) represents Disneys application of ""new"" technology to an old format. In many ways that matter this film recalls the recent classics of the Magic Kingdoms so-called ""Second Golden Era"" - The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast Aladdin The Lion King. However the hand-drawn animation that was state of the art in the late 1980s and early 1990s (and which was reinvigorated with limited success last year with The Princess and the Frog) has been replaced by CGI and is being projected in 3-D. Still despite the need to wear flimsy plastic glasses watching Tangled reminds one that some brands of storytelling never go out of style whatever that style may be. As if often the case with Disney a well-known fairy tale represents the foundation for a story that softens the edges and grafts on a happy ending. Thats not a criticism - Disney knows its audience and is adept at molding fables for maximum appeal. Here were introduced to Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) a princess stolen from the palace nursery while an infant and raised by the dastardly Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy). Imprisoned in the gilded cage of a tower because her hair has the power to continuously restore Mother Gothels youth Rapunzel dreams of the day when she will be allowed to roam free alongside her faithful chameleon companion. Her chance comes on the occasion of her 18th birthday while Mother Gothel is away. The rogue Flynn Ryder (Zachary Levi) seeking escape from a variety of pursuers climbs Rapunzels tower with the goal of finding a hiding place. Instead he encounters a determined young woman with an iron frying pan who knocks him out and ties him up. Then she bargains with him - if he acts as her guide for a sojourn in the world below shell return to him the contents of a satchel he had on his person when he invaded her room. All the ""Disney elements"" are in place a plucky princess; a chaste star-crossed romance; a cute animal sidekick; songs by Alan Menken (and his lyricist partner Glenn Slater); a diabolical villain; and of course a happy ending. The CGI is not an impediment to enjoying the tale - its done with elegance and an attention to detail and is rendered as well as anything out there. The 3-D is another matter. It falls into the category of ""somewhat distracting"" by muting the brilliance of the colors (which are eye-popping in the 2-D trailers and not so in the 3-D feature). There are also instances when blurriness is evident away from the center of the screen. Gimmickry occasionally intrudes as when a floating lantern drifts toward the audience. (The little girl sitting next to me stood up and reached for it.) Im comfortable recognizing that nearly all future animated movies will be released in 3-D but I expect better quality from any endeavor bearing the ""Disney"" trademark. Tangled occupies a plateau below the one where the best animated Disney movies reside. This is secondary fare - entertaining and enjoyable but not groundbreaking. Rapunzel although likeable and energetic is not as memorable as Snow White Ariel or Belle. The chameleon who does not speak is among the least recognizable animal sidekicks (although he possesses amusing mannerisms). And the songs despite being co-written by Alan Menken the man behind many of Disneys most unforgettable tunes are neither catchy nor memorable. Its hard to imagine someone humming ""When Will My Life Begin"" or ""Mother Knows Best"" when leaving the theater. The choices for vocal casting hearken back to Disneys approach during the late 1980s and early 1990s when big name stars where often bypassed in favor of lesser known talents. Mandy Moore possesses a generic female voice and strong vocals that allow her to perform her own singing - shes not immediately recognizable and that goes a long way toward audience acceptance of the character. Similarly the secondary performers - Zachary Levi Donna Murphy Jeffrey Tambor Brad Garrett - possess similar qualities. They bring life to their characters without forcing the viewer to dissociate an animated avatar from a familiar voice. Often (although not always) anonymity can be one of the greatest assets evidenced by a vocal performer in an animated setting. Tangled wanders into an animated jungle where Disney is no longer king. Certainly their Pixar division is at the top of the pyramid but its a competitive field with an immense audience. Tangled which is likely to appeal as strongly to parents as to their offspring is the kind of movie that should attract the crowds Disney has come to expect with their annual Thanksgiving releases. As a melding of new techniques and technology with old-fashioned methods of storytelling its an opportunity for the Magic Kingdom to remind audiences that when it comes to putting fairy tales on screen they remain on a higher level.

But with last years ""The Princess and the Frog"" it proved it could still produce gorgeous hand-drawn features that deserve to stand alongside earlier favorites. Tangled Directors Nathan Greno Byron Howard. Cast Voices of Mandy Moore Zachary Levi Donna Murphy. Rating PG for brief mild violence. And now with ""Tangled"" a delightfully fresh spin on ""Rapunzel"" the entertainment powerhouse delivers its first classic-caliber computer animation outside the Pixar family. The visuals are gorgeous especially in the subtly done 3-D. More important the story bridges the gap between timeless and timely in a way that will please Disney fans of any age. In the Brothers Grimm fairy tale an enchantress catches a thief in her garden and demands recompense in the form of his unborn daughter. In ""Tangled"" which opened Wednesday Rapunzel (voiced by Mandy Moore) is promoted to princess and is kidnapped as a baby because her magical hair can be used to keep the witch forever young - as long as those golden tresses are never cut. Her rescuer on the other hand is demoted from charming prince to a swashbuckling rogue Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi of TVs ""Chuck"") who happens upon Rapunzels tower prison while on the run from the palace guards after stealing the missing princess crown. While naive about the ways of the world this Rapunzel is hardly helpless using her extra-long hair to perform Spider-Man acrobatics and to save her hero more often than he saves her. Its a modern sensibility but one free of up-to-the-minute references that would soon render the film dated and one that inspires one of the most satisfying twist endings in recent memory. In true Disney fashion two of the most memorable characters are animals Pascal Rapunzels chameleon sidekick and Maximus a barrel-chested horse with the tracking skills of a bloodhound and a sense of duty straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan. If there is any complaint to make it is that the songs by Disneys go-to composer Alan Menken are competent but generic sounding just a little bit phoned in (not that this will prevent the obligatory Oscar nominations of course). It will be well worth any extra driving it might take to get to a 3-D-capable theater if only for an eye-popping scene of a wooden dam bursting into a glistening flood. Yet the animators make gentle use of this technology saving the literally in-your-face moments for when they will have the most impact not just visually but emotionally.

Old-fashioned storytelling barely prevails over sassy contempo attitude in ""Tangled."" Updating its toon-princess line for the era of CG and 3D the Disney team has infused this revisionist ""Rapunzel"" with the broad catchphrase-ready humor that seems to dominate much of studio animation these days. But while its banter can be off-putting the long-gestating fairy tale does demonstrate the sturdy narrative carpentry and musical pizzazz that have always been the studios stock-in-trade boding well for its prospects with a primarily but not exclusively girl-centric audience. Ancillary biz looks healthy especially if merchandising opportunities extend to hair products. After last years ""The Princess and the Frog"" grossed an underwhelming 104 million domestically Disney execs opted to change the title of the new film from ""Rapunzel"" to the more gender-neutral ""Tangled."" If that suggests a vote of no confidence in traditional princess fare (imagine if ""The Little Mermaid"" had been called ""Beached"") the hipper moniker does underscore the films odd somewhat perplexing mix of sensibilities -- pitched somewhere between Disney classicism and the self-conscious storybook quality of DreamWorks ""Shrek"" movies or at best Stephen Sondheims ""Into the Woods."" The script by Dan Fogelman (""Bolt"" ""Cars"") kicks off with a sly self-referencing narrator who tells the story of a good king and his pregnant ailing queen who is saved from certain death by a magical flower. The plants restorative properties are transferred to the queens infant daughter Rapunzel who is soon kidnapped by Mother Gothel (voiced by Donna Murphy) an evil crone bent on using the princess powers to remain eternally young and beautiful. Mother Gothel raises Rapunzel as her own daughter keeping her locked in a tower in the forest and never cutting the girls long golden hair the source of her extraordinary gift; as in the original Brothers Grimm yarn the witch uses those surprisingly clean and manageable 70-foot tresses to gain entry to the tower each day. Clearly not all blondes have more fun and the teenage Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) is more than ready to escape her confines. An opportunity presents itself when Flynn Rider (Zachary Levi) a handsome thief on the run sneaks into the tower one day. Like any good post-feminist Disney heroine Rapunzel defies the witchs orders (expressed in the authoritarian anthem ""Mother Knows Best"") and strikes a deal with the dashing fugitive who agrees to be her guide to the outside world shes always longed to see for herself. And see it she does running afoul of a band of merry ruffians and inevitably Mother Gothel who schemes to recapture Rapunzel and squelch her blossoming romance with Flynn. The brainchild of veteran Disney animator Glen Keane once slated to direct before helmers Byron Howard (""Bolt"") and Nathan Greno stepped in ""Tangled"" is snappily paced and easy enough to get wrapped up in propelled by a set of jaunty serviceable songs from venerable composer Alan Menken and lyricist Glenn Slater. If the film is hardly one for the pantheon thats because it seems more interested in tossing off one-liners than in tapping into its heroines deepest desires in the tradition of the best fairy tales. It doesnt help that Rapunzel has the bland plastic beauty of a Barbie doll and Moores spirited vocal turn lends her plenty of spunk but little in the way of personality. With Levis Flynn saddled with the clunkiest dialogue its up to Murphy to steal the show in a full-throated diva role one can easily imagine Bernadette Peters knocking out of the park in some future stage version. And given the scripts abundant chatter it was a shrewd decision to have the animal sidekicks (Rapunzels pet chameleon an ill-tempered steed) express themselves without the benefit of speech. ""Tangled"" becomes less grating and more emotionally attuned to its material as it goes on remaining mostly faithful to the Grimm yarn with a few clever elaborations (the climax though nowhere near as grisly contains a splash of blood that merited a PG rating). The helmers really find their groove in a soaring sequence -- in which Rapunzel and Flynn watch as hundreds of lanterns float in the sky above glowing like so many toasting marshmallows -- thats as sincere as it is lovely to behold. Such moments aside theres room for visual improvement particularly a garish unattractive underwater scene involving Rapunzels hair (which often resembles a very long coil of spaghetti extra al dente). The dimming effect of the 3D eye-wear seemed especially detrimental at the screening attended draining too much color and light from the image and causing skin tones to appear weirdly pixelated; the 3D engine is otherwise well deployed bringing a crisp vibrant definition to the films painterly forest landscapes.

Comments Tangled Recommended Rated PG  92 minutes  2010 The tale of Rapunzel gets a cheeky make-over in this gorgeous Disney animation which combines the studios traditional hand-drawn look with the sculptural qualities of digital 3D. The flippant narrator and unlikely hero is a narcissistic thief (given voice by Zachary Levi) who stumbles upon a hidden tower where the princess (Mandy Moore) is being held by a glamorous witch posing as her mother (Donna Murphy). Alan Menkens memorable songs include the show-stopping ""Mother Knows Best"" in which Murphy channels all the monstrous smothering power of Mama Rose in Gypsy. Byron Howard (Bolt) and Nathan Greno directed.
