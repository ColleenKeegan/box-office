I liked it better when they called it The Love Boat. For once the multiple plot lines blend together effectively eliminating the need for chapter stops. Normally with a dozen directors to choose from one or two of the shorts would automatically rise to the top. Not even Paolo Sorrentino (Il Divo The Great Beauty) can muster more than a cute one-joke reversal in the time allotted. Nor do I remember as many saccharine musical interludes in the previous two installments. And countless shots of the Christ the Redeemer statue notwithstanding for all were told about the titular location they might just as well spread the love in Jersey. With Emily Mortimer Harvey Keitel and Wagner Moura. 2014. -- Scott Marks This movie is not currently in theaters.

The movie ""Rio I Love You"" not so much.The film is the latest entry in a series that began with 2006s ""Paris Je Taime"" and was followed two years later by ""New York I Love You.""  If this doesnt kill the franchise dead nothing will.The movies are all collections of short films by various directors loosely tied together. In ""Rio"" that means 10 stories told by 10 directors in 10 differing styles. Strangely almost everyone must have been in the middle of some weird creative dry spell. Some stories are pretentious some are annoyingly whimsical and some are just out-and-out obnoxious.Director Guillermo Arriago (left) and actor Jason Isaacs of ""Rio I Love You."" (Photo Screen Media Films)Perhaps the worst offender in ""Rio"" comes from John Turturro who writes directs and stars in a tiring segment in which he essentially bickers with Vanessa Paradis for 10 minutes. It elicits no laughs no drama no response of any kind other than wondering why anyone thought Paradis with a Harpo Marx hairdo was a good idea. Oh and Paradis sings at the end like its one of her music videos from the 80s.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestIn another piece you get Brazilian actress and Oscar nominee Fernanda Montenegro as a woman who chooses to be homeless; it makes surviving in the streets look like a delightfully kooky lifestyle choice like renting a loft. There are also bits with a vampire and a hang glider who shouts out his grievances at the Christ the Redeemer statue. Throw in a cameo appearance by Bebel Gilberto (daughter of Joao Gilberto of ""The Girl From Ipanema"" fame) as a singing fairy and you get a movie that is a big collective mess.Ryan Kwanten stars in ""Rio I Love You."" (Photo Screen Media Films)The only segment that generates any kind of emotional involvement is about a one-armed boxer named Texas (Land Vieira) who receives a disturbing offer from a visitor (a sinister Jason Isaacs). Guillermo Arriaga writes and directs with an elegant haunting touch and the piece boasts the unsettling overtones found in a good episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents.""AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceDespite the power and resonance of Arriagas segment thats not enough to make you want to suffer through the charm-free 100 minutes that make up the rest of the film. On the plus side Rio looks fabulous with everything depicted in vivid and vibrant colors. Then again you could get that in a tourism commercial and it would be a lot less painful to sit through.Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 The roster of stars and directors in Rio I Love You an omnibus of shorts set in and celebrating the Brazilian city is impressive. John Turturro Emily Mortimer Vincent Cassell Vanessa Paradis Harvey Keitel Fernanda Montenegro in front of the camera. Turturro Stephan Elliott Paolo Sorrentino Fernando Meirelles Nadine Labaki writer Guillermo Arriaga and others behind it. But if the beauty of Rio de Janeiro is jaw-dropping so too is the slipshod manner in which the aforementioned talents go about their business there. A sequel of sorts to the anthology pics Paris je taime and New York I Love You the tertiarily connected episodes of Rio I Love You ramble shamble and perambulate rarely amounting to anything at all. There is whimsy (a vampire waiter) there is domestic upheaval (couples fighting couples sulking) there are a one-armed boxer a homeless woman and a street urchin who thinks he has Jesus on the phone at the train station. Keitel plays an actor not unlike himself making a movie in which he portrays a priest (the first time we see him hes in a passionate kiss with a nun). Wagner Moura hang-glides above Rios iconic Christ statue listing the woes of the host city for the coming Summer Olympics. A cabbie (Michel Melamed) shares the photo of the woman whom he loves and who has left him with every fare who climbs in the car. Whats it all about Alfonso? About tourism (despite the hang-gliders rant). About serious moviemakers glomming some serious vacation time.

Tonico Pereira as a tourist restaurant waiter named Fernando in ""Rio I Love You."" (Screen Media Films) Michael Rechtshaffen Even viewers who were transported by the considerable charm of 2006s ""Paris je taime"" will be hard-pressed to show any love for the latest entry in the travelog/anthology.Despite its connotation of sun-drenched sensuality ""Rio I Love You"" is a dispiritingly dull affair haphazardly joining together 10 mini-films directed by a collective of international filmmakers and featuring the likes of Harvey Keitel Emily Mortimer John Turturro and Vanessa Paradis that prove to be decidedly more miss than hit. Only a small handful by native Brazilians show any spark -- such as Andrucha Waddingtons ""Mrs. Nobody"" starring the great Fernanda Montenegro as a grandmother who embraces homelessness and ""City of God"" director Fernando Meirelles rhythmic ""The Muse"" which eschews dialogue for a more artistic take on the rhythms of the city.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; But the vast majority of the segments alternately pretentious and pointless and populated by an array of uncommunicative couples disenchanted para-gliders love-struck priests and elderly fanged waiters are played out against an uninspired bossa nova beat.Sure it all looks picture postcard pretty but between this and the seriously uneven ""New York I Love You"" those taking in any future installments in the Cities of Love franchise (Shanghai and Jerusalem are reportedly under consideration) might wish to take out travelers insurance.-------------""Rio I Love You"" In English Portuguese French and Spanish with English subtitlesMPAA rating R for language and brief sexuality/nudityRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesPlaying Landmark Nuart West L.A.

Comments Rio I Love You 110 minutes  2014 Producer Emmanuel Benbihy has taken it upon himself to bring love to the world one city at a time and after Paris Je TAime (2006) and New York I Love You (2009) he hits Rio de Janeiro with the usual international assortment of directors whose short segments are strung together into a single narrative (2014). The attractions here are Paolo Sorrentino (The Great Beauty) whose typically wry story involves a rich old coot (Basil Hoffman) and his pretty young wife (Emily Mortimer); Im Sang-soo (The Housemaid) spinning a wild tale of vampires who have taken over a town and dance in the streets at night; and Jose Padilha (Elite Force) whose hero skydives past the giant Christ the Redeemer statue and tells Jesus off. Unfortunately these striking moments are overtaken by the fruit-juice mediocrity of everything else particularly a connecting narrative about a cabdriver who insists on telling all his riders about the woman who got away. With luck the franchise should give out before we have to watch Boise I Love You. In English and subtitled French Spanish and Portuguese. By J.R.

EntertainmentMovies Rio I Love You 10 drifting stories more like tourist promo Originally published April 28 2016 at 600 am Updated April 28 2016 at 243 pm A movie star (Ryan Kwanten left) and his tour guide (Marcelo Serrado) go climbing in ""Rio I Love You."" Movie review of ""Rio I Love You"" Ten directors worked on this disappointing anthology about modern Rio de Janeiro. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times The 1953 collection ""Love in the City"" gave Fellini Antonioni and other directors the chance to explore short-story possibilities set in Rome. The Coen brothers (and others) took on the anthology format in ""Paris je taime"" (2006). Now its Rios turn. ""Rio I Love You"" takes 10 directors to tell 10 romantic stories although theyre more like fragments of stories that drift toward each other with dreamlike forward movement. At first the emphasis on celebrities suggests a fascination with marquee names in front of and behind the cameras. Harvey Keitel turns up as an actor whose dark glasses dont hide the fact that hes pretending to be a priest. (He makes a dopey in-joke about ""Goodfellas"" thats directed at the cameras.) Movie Review 1/2   Rio I Love You with Harvey Keitel Ryan Kwanten Fernanda Montenegro John Turturro. Various directors and screenwriters. 110 minutes. Rated R for language and brief sexuality/nudity. In English and Portuguese with English subtitles. Sundance Cinemas (21+). Ryan Kwanten the hunky Australian star of ""True Blood"" turns up as a teen idol weary of hysterical girl fans. He escapes by taking his chatty tour guide on a climbing trip to the top of Sugarloaf Mountain. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

John Turturro listed as a writer actor and director on the project has a self-consciously bitchy scene with a woman who insists that ""We had something -- and you blew it."" This could also describe ""Rio I Love You"" which is stuffed with touristy images but not enough dramatic substance to make any of them count. Characters come and go they play tricks on each other on the beaches they swoon over the sunsets. The final effect suggests all the depth of a Chamber of Commerce ad campaign.

""Rio I Love You"" is 10 short stories about the Brazilian city by 10 directors. Rio I Love You dull omnibus film of 10 stories 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Theres no mention of the Zika virus problematic Olympic preparations or any other real-life horrors in ""Rio I Love You"" but this mind-numbingly dull omnibus film of 10 short stories -- by 10 directors -- creates its own disasters. Its the third in a series of films following ""Paris je taime"" (2006) and ""New York I Love You"" (2009). Near the beginning of ""Rio"" Harvey Keitel plays a priest. He leans in to kiss a nun. Their lips meet ... ""Cut"" yells the director. So hes really not a priest -- hes an actor filming a movie. Clever huh? We meet several other celebrities briefly -- Emily Mortimer as a beautiful woman caring for her husband who is 30 years older than her and in a wheelchair; Vincent Cassel as a sand sculptor on the beach; John Turturro and Vanessa Paradis as quarreling lovers (perhaps the most excruciating of the 10 stories and Turturro is the director); and a host of Brazilian actors well known to Brazilian audiences including the great Fernanda Montenegro (""Central Station"") as a homeless woman. The directorial talent assembled is top-notch including Brazils Fernando Meirelles (""City of God"") Mexicos Guillermo Arriaga (Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus collaborator in the 2000s) Australias Stephan Elliott (""The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert"") and South Koreas Im Sang-soo (""The Housemaid""). But they dont have time to flex their storytelling muscles. Keitel does crop up later for a nice moment with a homeless boy and there is a pleasing sequence at the end that integrates the characters to create a smooth ending but omnibus films -- ""Dead of Night"" ""Twilight Zone -- The Movie"" and ""New York Stories"" come to mind -- are always hit and miss. Part of the reason ""Rio I Love You"" is such a big whiff is that 10 stories are just way too many. Had producers cut it down to say the five most promising stories and fleshed them out a bit the results might have been better. Instead just as you might be getting sucked into a story its over. G.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Pat Padua April 21 Vincent Cassel appears as Ze in ""The Muse."" The story is part of ""Rio I Love You"" the third film in the ""Cities of Love"" series. (Screen Media Films) There are more than 6 million potential love stories in Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately none of the 10 that have been assembled in the anthology film ""Rio I Love You"" is any good. Ten directors have created 10 interwoven vignettes that for nearly two hours provide moments of mild amusement tepid melodrama and for relief great music. ""La Fortuna"" from director Paolo Sorrentino (""The Great Beauty"") is typical of the films misfires. Dorothy (Emily Mortimer) is a former model who thinks that her wealthy older husband (Basil Hoffman) may have died during their flight to Rio. To her chagrin hes merely asleep and he gets the last laugh. Its a sitcom setup but as the entire tale unfolds in less than 10 minutes its a sitcom for people with short attention spans. That failed segment spotlights what little ""Rio I Love You"" has to offer beautiful scenery and a terrific soundtrack in this case Luiz Gonzagas vibrant 1974 dance number ""O Fole Roncou."" But despite the nod to local music theres no compelling reason to set this episode in Brazil. The same goes for ""When There Is No More Love"" written and directed by John Turturro who also stars as a man squabbling with his lover (Vanessa Paradis) in a modest island home that could be anywhere. Notably none of the actors or directors of those two segments are in fact Brazilian. Unfortunately the directors who are dont fare much better. Fernando Meirelles (""City of God"") directs Vincent Cassel as Ze a beach bum who makes a sand sculpture of Rodins ""The Kiss."" He tears this down when he sees a beautiful young woman on the boardwalk and builds a grotesque sculpture of her feet. Believe it or not this segment is called ""The Muse."" With 10 directors incoherence is a concern. But shifting tones are not the problem here. The films editors weave the strands of this scattered tapestry as well as can be expected and the film is wonderful to look at. Its just that the writing is consistently terrible. And lets not even get into the vampire story. The film gives us one character who might actually have a dramatic inner life. Directed by Andrucha Waddington ""Mrs. Nobody"" follows a homeless woman (Fernanda Montenegro so terrific in ""Central Station"") whose reasons for going off the grid are never stated. Her grandson Leandro (Eduardo Sterblitch) approaches her telling her his family told him she was dead. The segment ends with them walking into a public fountain a baptism of cheap sentiment. ""Rio I Love You"" is the third film in the ""Cities of Love"" series after ""Paris Je tAime"" and ""New York I Love You."" If this latest installment is any indication all that jet-setting should be avoided. You can have just as much fun staying home. R. At Landmarks Bethesda Row Cinema.

Each feature-length film strings together multiple shorts by different directors and the third installment sticks to the same recipe booking a flight to the picturesque city of Rio de Janeiro. In Rio I Love You Benbihy recruits directors Andrucha Waddington Paolo Sorrentino Frenando Meirelles Stephan Elliott John Turturro Guillermo Arriaga Sang Soo Im Carlos Saldanha Jose Padilha and Nadine Labaki to each helm a short tale of love. As can be expected some shorts are considerably stronger than others and Labakis ""The Miracle"" featuring Harvey Keitel is a particular highlight following two international actors and a young boy who believes he has Jesus direct telephone number. Less successful are shorts like Turturros ""When There Is No More Love"" which is basically just 10 minutes of Vanessa Paradis lip synching to one of her own songs and Sorrentinos ""La Fortuna"" which casts Emily Mortimer as a bitter and nagging trophy wife. Vincente Amorim weaves each short together with lots of sweeping panoramas of the city and the end result feels less like a collection of love stories and more like a bland tourism ad. (The only short with any um teeth is Sang Soo Ims bizarre tale of an elderly vampire waiter and the prostitute hes in love with.) The shots of Rios scenic vistas are captivating. The shorts actual storylines are less so. C- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Paolo Sorrentinos black-comic contribution could take place anywhere really with nothing gained by setting its nasty punchline on a Rio beach beyond some pretty scenery. Same with John Turturros end-of-relationship lament which risibly turns into a sleek Vanessa Paradis music video and Guillermo Arriagas tale of a one-armed boxers attempted redemption which perversely has no ending. Film Details Rio I Love You (Rio Eu Te Amo) RatingR GenreComedy Running Time110 min. More Info EXPAND Two of the better shorts thrive on visual dazzle alone Fernando Meirelles stages an amusing wordless ballet of feet and sand sculptures while professional ballet dancers figure into Carlos Saldanhas entrancing combination of shadow play and relationship drama. But even the more Rio-specific ones are dire Stephan Elliotts showbiz lark with Ryan Kwanten and his chauffeur finding an angel atop Sugarloaf Mountain; Im Sang-soos ridiculous tale of vampire butlers and hookers; and Nadine Labakis offensive extended joke with Harvey Keitel in tow about a kid who claims Jesus is calling him on a pay phone. Leave it to two Brazilian filmmakers to reveal the touristic gaze of the rest of this barrel-scraping collective project. Andrucha Waddington addresses Rios homeless problem albeit by finding a dubious romanticism in a grandmothers (Fernanda Montenegro) deliberate homelessness. More bracingly Jose Padilha ends his otherwise ethereal short by having his hang-glider rant at the Christ the Redeemer statue about the social injustices going on in the streets.Rio I Love You Various directors Screen Media Films Opens April 15 Landmark Sunshine Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Share Tweet Big-screen incarnations of superheroes like Spider-Man and Superman have seen their share of franchise stresses but few movie series have experienced a nosedive like the one currently afflicting the worlds great cities. With Paris Je Taime producer Emmanuel Benbihy kicked off an anthology film project designed to showcase a variety of filmmakers telling love-centric location-specific stories. Paris made an auspicious beginning featuring contributions from Alfonso Cuaron the Coen brothers Tom Tykwer Gus Van Sant and Alexander Payne among others. Its puzzling then that New York I Love You couldnt attract anywhere near that level of talent loading up on second-or-third-tier filmmakers (Shekhar Kapur; Brett Ratner) and the occasional directing actor (Natalie Portman who starred in Tykwers Paris segment; Scarlett Johansson whose film was cut). Now the series has arrived at Rio I Love You (though Tbilisi I Love You set in the capital of Georgia apparently received a VOD-only release in the U.S. last year). Unfortunately Rio veers closer to New York than Paris in terms of both quality and inability to construct anything like a valentine to its subject (though its at least a little weirder than the frequently inane New York). This has little to do with the inherently uneven nature of anthology film; that unevenness can be in its short-attention-span lottery sort of way quite engaging. Rather Rio offers the uncomfortable spectacle of 10 different filmmakers mostly failing to produce a sense of place that can be sustained over 10 minutes much less multiple senses of place that can be stitched into an interesting patchwork. The major takeaways from Rio about Rio are that it has beaches and homeless people. The slightest tweaking could turn this movie from Rio I Love You into Beaches Youre Okay.The assembled filmmakers are at least more diverse and less disappointing than the New York group. They include Brazilian directors Fernando Meirelles (City Of God) Carlos Saldanha (the cartoon movie Rio) and two Rio natives Jose Padilha and Andrucha Waddington. The Brazilians are joined by Im Sang-soo from South Korea Lebanese writer-director Nadine Labaki Australian Stephan Elliott Oscar-winning Paolo Sorrentino from Italy Mexican screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga and American weirdo John Turturro. Some of the names most familiar to U.S. audiences deliver some of the worst bits The Great Beauty director Sorrentino fresh off Youth further muses on aging by looking in on elderly James (Basil Hoffman) and his younger wife Dorothy (Emily Mortimer) and establishes a movie-wide tendency toward bad exposition-heavy dialogue (""All your health problems and you want to smoke?"") and combining it with his own personal kind of stupid musings (""As an architect I believe luck can be designed"") all leading up to a sour sort of-punchline. Turturro meanwhile delivers the Romance amp; Cigarettes follow-up no one asked for with all of the stagy dialogue and earthy domestic squabbling and little of the sweaty musical chutzpah.Indeed many of the shorts favor bad writing over strong filmmaking. One exception is the Meirelles segment with Vincent Cassel as a sand artist working on the beach. Its composed largely of shots positioned above or below normal sight lines--some overhead some ground-level--and accented with blown-out colors and a shifting percussive score representing various passersby. Its not very plotty but feels more like an actual short than almost anything else in the larger film. Animation director Saldanha also makes a play for differentiation with a striking ballet-centric (and dialogue-light) bit and Im contributes an amusing vampire story.These three stand out because as the so-called ""cities of love"" series has continued it has developed a strange relationship with its very nature as a series of short film collections. Paris featured some minor linking material in between stylistically distinct films and New York imposed a framing character on a less distinguished group of shorts. Rio is trickier to figure out; there is semi-connective material credited to director Vicente Amorim who seems to have been given access to some of the segments actors. Its hard to tell because the movie introduces a few (but not all) characters before their stories really get underway sometimes creating the impression that theyre intercut. Instead they fall confusingly in between with a few fragments of introductory teases interspersed throughout the film especially at the beginning.In a movie by a single filmmaker this might create a nice rhythm but these ill-conceived overlaps only make Rio harder to settle into--a disadvantage for a movie telling 10 different stories. The pieces are especially hard to separate this time because most of them cap a style-light few minutes with inconclusive unsatisfying fade-outs. The final film feels like a producers single unimaginative vision rather than an appealing omnibus. New York I Love You failed to recapture the eclecticism that made Paris so special. Rio I Love You has moved on to actively undermining it.
