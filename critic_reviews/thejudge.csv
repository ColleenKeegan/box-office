Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post There are a number of fine reasons to see the courtroom-meets-family melodrama ""The Judge."" As you might suspect two stand out actors Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. Portraying estranged father and son respectively honorable judge and hot-shot defense attorney -- and the accused and his lawyer -- the duo circle each other square off growl and occasionally draw blood. After a willful absence Hank Palmer (Downey Jr.) returns to Carlinville Ind. for his beloved mothers funeral. Much like he did 20 years earlier he high-tails it out of the bucolic town as soon as he can. Only hes called back by older brother Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) when the judge is hauled in by the sheriff for a car accident. Joseph Palmers 73 Coupe DeVille has a battered fender and blood on the grille. A man was found dead on a dark wet road. Turns out the man and the judge have a history. The sort of past that allows prosecutor Dwight Dickham to lay out a case for premeditation. As fictional names go this one seems sort of silly but Billy Bob Thornton plays the role with a fixed intent that makes it clear Dickhams no joke. For comic relief theres Dax Shepards turn as Joes original and out-of-his depth defender C.P. Kennedy. Beyond the ""did he or didnt he?"" quandaries more familial mysteries hang in the summertime humidity. Why did Hank flee those many years ago? How is it possible his nicely precocious daughter Lauren (Emma Tremblay) never met her grandmother? Not that Hank went so very far away. He plies his well-compensated trade in Chicago where he lives in a wood and glass house with a wife whos had it with him. We see vivacious wife-and-mother Mary Palmer (Carol S. Austin) mostly through the footage of son Dales Super 8 camera. The youngest of the three Palmer boys played by Jeremy Strong Dale has a cognitive handicap that his constant filming signals as well as tempers. Its clear from his early home movies who kept this clan together. Its less clear what it will take to reunite them. DOnofrio as eldest son Glen conveys an observant silence -- not smug but burdened. ""The Judge"" foregrounds familial wounds against a backdrop of courtroom tension. Yes director David Dobkins gestures feel at times overly typical of the two well-traveled genres. More often due to some barbed dialogue by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque this drama finds prickly tenderness in subtle even humorous revelations about fathers and sons home and hometowns. Vera Farmiga plays Hanks high-school girlfriend Samantha. Farmiga makes a nice argument that theres a richer identity in being the one who stayed than the stereotypical one that got away. Vying with Mary Palmer for the ghost hanging most over this tale might be that of Atticus Finch. Hank mentions the hero of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and Carlinvilles courtroom with its balcony even resembles the one Gregory Peck made famous in the 1962 film which marked the big-screen debut of a fellow named Robert Duvall. Hank watches from the balcony as the Judge does his thing. Joe Palmers thing fulfills a wish many of us still harbor for perfectly executed paternalism. Downey Jr. and Duvall satisfy a moviegoers yearning for performances of stillness and bravado not afraid of sentiment or grace.

Its a melodrama of big gestures and even bigger weather and theres pleasure to be gained from its old-fashioned charms even if its various working parts - Janusz Kaminskis far-from-intimate photography; Wedding Crashers director David Dobkins comic leanings; the scripts quieter moments; Downey Jrs inescapable vanity - rarely seem to be working in complete harmony. This familys a fucking Picasso painting spits Hank when he returns to his familys Indiana small town for the first time in years. Hanks mother is dead and hes back for the funeral and to reunite briefly with his two brothers one (Vincent DOnofrio) who bears a grudge and another (Jeremy Strong) whose childlike mental state means he still lives at home the innocent ingredient in a dysfunctional domestic stew. Elsewhere one of Hanks old flames (Vera Farmiga) now runs the local diner but its her grownup barmaid daughter (Leighton Meester) to whom Hank unwittingly takes a shine. Hanks brief homecoming soon morphs into a scenario that could give John Grisham a run for his money when his dad unexpectedly finds himself in need of legal counsel. Out of the blue Joseph is accused of killing a no-good local in a hit-and-run car accident. Its lucky then that his sons a lawyer and the local courthouse looks like a set ready-made for the movies third act. Its lucky too for Billy Bob Thornton he gets to chew the courtroom wood-panelling as a smarmy prosecution lawyer. A charismatic performance from Downey Jr and the growling presence of Duvall makes up for a multitude of sins in this big and brash family drama that puts the heavy emphasis on drama over family - so much so that a key late emotional scene is swallowed up by its surroundings and a central showdown between Hank and Joseph seems to catch even the filmmakers unaware. Yet theres a stream of provincial resentment and nastiness running through The Judge that stops it from being entirely hollow. Its a simple story about a lost boy coming home thats over-cooked over-decorated and sentimental. At the same time though its rarely too cloying and its bearhug energy and distracting cast just about act as fair compensation.

Posted October 16 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Its been a while since weve seen Robert Downey Jr. as anything other than Iron Man or Sherlock Holmes. But in The Judge he plays the closest thing to a real human being hes tackled in ages. The film is a throwback to the rousing middle-of-the-road courtroom dramas that flourished during the Grisham box office gold rush of the mid-90s. Back then movies like The Firm and A Time to Kill turned self-righteousness and witness-stand theatrics into the kinds of crowd-pleasers that made you think. How quaint. How old-fashioned. How extinct. I dont expect The Judge to usher in a new era of legal thrillers but Im happy to see Downey leave the Marvel universe and Baker Street behind. As hotshot Chicago attorney Hank Palmer Downey is his usual onscreen type -- the whip-smart wiseass whos cynical and selfish...until hes not. When his mother dies he returns to his rural Indiana hometown and is forced to stay and defend his estranged holier-than-thou father (Robert Duvall) a respected local judge after hes arrested for the hit-and-run murder of an ex-con he once put away. What makes the film more than just a dusty Grisham retread is that the case (as compelling as it is) is merely the backdrop for a more emotionally engaging story about fathers and sons played like a duet by two virtuoso actors who give the film not only all they have but probably more than it requires.

"Mistrial and Error RDJs Messy The Judge and the Highs and Lows of Whats New This Week << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Mistrial and Error RDJs Messy The Judge and the Highs and Lows of Whats New This Week Movies October 10 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print At least a dozen movies are opening around the country this week. More than half of them are in The Judge. Not different genres per se just different movies. Theres the one in which greasy careerist Hank Palmer (Robert Downey Jr.) puts the brakes on lucrative defense-lawyering in order to be good and folksy; theres the one in which he returns to his small Indiana hometown and winds up defending his estranged father -- Judge Joe Palmer (Robert Duvall) -- in a murder case. Theres the one in which he resumes flirtation with his high school flame Samantha (Vera Farmiga) the Cool-Girl Ex Who Never (Ever) Left Town and the one in which he and his equally estranged brothers Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) and Dale (Jeremy Strong) bond over their mothers recent death. And thats not even accounting for the movie about the widowed judge himself whos secretly ailing requiring snobby Hank to play caregiver. Is there time to mention the movie about Hanks nasty divorce and relationship with his only-in-the-movies adorable tweenage daughter (Emma Tremblay) whos never met Grandpa? More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage These stories could work in a single film. But in The Judge they dont. The studio knows this. A baffled friend has been sending me notes for weeks about how each TV ad is for a new movie. The only thing all these parts of the finished product have in common is Downey who glides into each sequence as though the previous one hasnt happened. Hank is smug and testy. As he hops into his sports car bound for his mothers funeral he berates his soon-to-be ex-wife for cheating on him. His put-downs are mean but chummy. Then as he drives off from his modernist glass-and-metal fortress his tone changes in response to a plea from the wife. ""You wanna do something for me Water the fucking hydrangeas"" Back home in fictional Carlinville Hank basically gets amnesia when it comes to the hurt hes caused everyone in his past. But to be fair they dont seem to care -- theyre just so glad hes back Within minutes of walking into Samanthas waterfront restaurant (please dont make me tell you what its called)1 Downeys being bathed in whatever moonlight is spilling off Farmiga Its as if theyve always been together. No one can hold a grudge against Hank because theyre already carrying his water. The Judge is maddening and this is mostly why. There is no reason to like Hank. As a professional hes an asshole. As a man hes a brat. But the movie keeps stacking the scenes in his favor. Even when hes wrong he gets the last word. Watching Downey patronize his family and condescend to the goober attorney (Dax Shepard) that Judge Joe initially hires I had the same feeling I did seeing Tom Cruise swoop into town and outwit everybody in Jack Reacher -- the locals are mostly portrayed as dim and parochial even tough lunar-lit Farmiga. Theres a brief moment when Hank receives his comeuppance from Judge Joe. But thats not permitted to stand. The fathers health is rigged so that the son retains the compassionate upper hand. Most of The Judge is built on rough sketchy writing (credited to Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque). (You know the movies in the creative basement when your hear that the no-nonsense prosecuting attorneys name is Dwight Dickham played by Billy Bob Thornton.) Theres a stab at sex farce and several whacks at family tragedy. But the director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers) cant do much with apples and oranges except find a banana to add to the mix. If an audience goes for this movie -- there was big laughter and some sniffling the night I saw it -- thats due to Downeys charisma. But his arrogance is miscalibrated here. Its impossible to be a withering snob and a saint who suffers; to be Albert Brooks and Jack Lemmon. Other stars can do more appealing peacocks George Clooney and Brad Pitt come with a moral core; Denzel Washington gets away with being better than you because well he is and part of whats better is his sexiness. But those men can laugh at themselves. Downeys shtick is really just laughing at the people around him. Whats funny to most Downey characters is that were not him. That persona is the engine of the Iron Man movies. Not only is his sleazy billionaire richer than we are hes also demonstrably more brilliant and puts that brilliance to superheroic use. When Downey stars in other movies like this one and Due Date hes just a defensive bitterly sarcastic version of his trust-fund burnout in Less Than Zero. That sort of adolescent entitlement is where the movies are right now. Its as if no one has any trust -- in the material the audience themselves -- to tell one story in an absorbing complicated way. Some of this is the direct result of what happens when too many grown-ups have moved into fantasyland. No one knows what an adult looks like or how an adult behaves because no one wants to be one. Some of it is the preponderance of television in our lives. Shapeless lawless beholden seemingly to no one television as an entity is everywhere and everything. The movies feel beholden to it. The clanging plots and sloppy ideas and overpopulated underutilized casts the muscle-pulling pivots from comedy to drama seriousness to schmaltz This Is Where I Leave You and Men Women amp; Children and now The Judge all feel like TV that television wouldnt want. Whatever is happening with Hollywood movies at the moment you can feel it in The Judge. Its not that it doesnt know what kind of movie to be. Its that it wants to be many movies and fails at being even one of them. Hanks been dredged in a batter of glibness then deep-fried in a vat of need. One of the storys father-son showdowns can be accurately reduced to I needed a hug and you never gave me one. Its embarrassing to see the filmmakers trying to connect the Palmers dysfunction with the legal matters at hand. As it turns out the truth about the case is rather poignant. The movie could have done more with it. But the courtroom scenes are too much at either extreme. One minute Dobkin is doing To Kill a Mockingbird the next its My Cousin Vinny.2 It doesnt feel good to remember that 25 years ago the moral and dramatic stakes were higher. Jessica Lange starred in Costa-Gavrass Music Box as an attorney defending her father (Armin Mueller-Stahl) against charges that he was a Nazi who had worked in the death camps. That movie wasnt perfect but it had warmth and was serious with small spasms of human comedy. Lange and Mueller-Stahl acted from a place of deep emotional connection. And crucially the trial was structured with suspense. You cared about the case and what the verdict would do to that family. Who knows what The Judge is about or whats important to it? More people are going to see it than will ever see Music Box. But if the movie is a hit itll be one thats getting away with murder.  Gary Webb the journalist Jeremy Renner plays in Kill the Messenger also believes hes smarter than everyone. But hes found himself in the midst of a scandalous story It seems that the Central Intelligence Agency did little to stop the U.S. drug epidemic of the 1980s because it was in bed with the Nicaraguan contras some of whom used the smuggling proceeds to arm themselves in their insurgency against the Sandinista government. Webb worked for the San Jose Mercury News and took his own life 10 years ago after almost a decade of defending his work to both an aggressively skeptical national press and a chagrined CIA. In 1995 and 1996 he wrote and reported on a devastating three-part series that blew the lid off those secret alliances catching fire on the Internet at a time when the web carried a fraction of the content it does today. The stories were sensationally packaged and probably overreached. Their implication that the CIA put crack in South Central Los Angeles is a myth that still persists today. At its best the movie dramatizes the ways in which control of the story gets away from Webb. It drops in on the newsrooms of the bigger more powerful New York Times Los Angeles Times and Washington Post which defile Webb and debunk the stories rather than building on them. This stretch of Michael Cuestas movie is a lean paranoia thriller with volleying telephone calls and the government closing in and tense meetings within different organizations including at the Mercury News about how to proceed with Webbs work. But it takes an hour to get there and the tension doesnt last long enough once it does. The screenplay is by Peter Landesman and is based on a pair of nonfiction books Webbs own Dark Alliance The CIA the Contras and the Crack Cocaine Explosion and Nick Schous Kill the Messenger How the CIAs Crack-Cocaine Controversy Destroyed Journalist Gary Webb. Its probably a miracle that Landesman located a two-hour movie in all that material. Theres one nicely done scene in the early going with Webb convicted drug dealer ""Freeway"" Rick Ross (Michael Kenneth Williams) and Rosss attorney (Tim Blake Nelson) in which Ross tells Webb that a cartel guy was also a CIA operative and Webb kind of cant believe it. The comedy in their incredulity points to a different possibly satirical film. But thats just about the only humor this otherwise solemn movie can afford. Webbs pieces about harsh drug forfeiture lead to a busty flirtatious Latina (Paz Vega) coming on to him in a diner to give him documents that point to a bigger story. For an hour it looks as if Kill the Messenger might be one of those vast topical conspiracy dramas like Traffic or Syriana thats more interested in how the conspiracy affects white people than how it affects everyone else. (There are parts here for Richard Schiff Oliver Platt Mary Elizabeth Winstead Michael Sheen Robert Patrick Andy Garcia and Ray Liotta.) It takes too long to make clear that Kill the Messenger is ultimately concerned with Webbs heroism and downfall. Along the way cliches and obviousness litter the movie. When Webb sits down to start writing he puts on the Clash while a montage plays of guns and soldiers faces and black men being locked up. Theres a shot of a camera clicking away at Webb while hes on the go. Meetings with government officials turn ominous in a way that requires Renner to lower his head and make a face that asks ""How did I wind up in The Pelican Brief?"" Just as I finished saying They forgot the scary parking-lot sequence the scary parking-lot sequence came. Renner is consistently strong. Hes a character actor who like Dustin Hoffman hides in plain sight. Unlike Hoffman he might never get the major acclaim he deserves. He doesnt feel compelled to pull the stops out. He was just as alive as everybody else in American Hustle but winning a scene didnt appear to be his goal. Theres shaggy righteousness to Renner as Webb moves from bafflement to fear to anger to something morose. When the brightness goes out of the performance the shading he uses is impeccable. One sequence at a journalism banquet is lit and decorated in a way that feels like the lining of a coffin. The movie wants very much to be a moral and ethical tragedy. And Renner by that point understands Webb to be a martyr participating in his own funeral. It makes sense that Kill the Messenger works when its driven by the action of internal debate and journalistic backstabbing. Cuesta has spent a long time crafting intrigue on Showtimes terrorism drama Homeland. He gives assurance to the scenes of people plotting their next moves. But the movie either needed to be told entirely from inside Webbs point of view or he should be part of larger more integrated work. Kill the Messenger has neither the artistry nor the athleticism to do both.  Ive written before that Im not a fan of movies about parental suffering. Theyre records playing at too slow an RPM and can bring out the worst in an actor. The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby is a parental dirge too but its a patient eloquent one. It opens with a woman Eleanor (Jessica Chastain) jumping off the Manhattan Bridge. She survives but rather than back up to explain how shes come to this first-time writer and director Ned Benson moves forward to show you how she continues to live with herself. Thats the first side Her. Benson flips the album and in the second half -- Him -- Eleanors husband Conor (James McAvoy) tries to live without her. Bensons staffed both halves with strong actors. William Hurt and Isabelle Huppert make perfect psychological and genetic sense as her parents; Jess Weixler is her younger sister. Eleanor starts taking classes and a steely Viola Davis plays the professor. Ciaran Hinds is Conors frigid dad. Bill Hader and Nina Arianda work at the failing restaurant he owns. The Weinstein Company acquired the film and released a conflated edition last month -- Them -- that was an hour shorter. It hung together. Nothing seemed to be missing except everything that felt special in the two-sided version -- its quiet and patience and searching emotionalism; the finesse and assurance of the acting; the sense that two lives were happening to you. Them was like reaching into a dryer and pulling out a shrunken delicate. It should never have gone in the wash in the first place. Im sensitive to the charge that Bensons made a slow callow bourgeois movie and that its probably unfair to Conors side of things thats it ultimately not about enough. But I watched this movie -- the longer two-sided version which is being released this weekend -- in a state of captivation. I was seeing a new filmmaker one with a smart eye and a talent for establishing and maintaining psychological intricacy. American movies are running perilously low on fresh youngish talent. Who knows what Benson will do next. I just left his first movie desperate to experience the second one.  Its quite a pronouncement to call your vampire movie Dracula Untold. After scores of movies books and television shows and millions of Halloween costumes what else is there to tell? Lots apparently. Dracs agent obliged and now hes in what is basically 300 Games of Thrones. The story dares to prequelize Bram Stokers 1897 novel giving us Luke Evans as Transylvanias Vlad III Tepes a.k.a. Vlad the Impaler a.k.a. Count Dracula and his transformation from warrior-prince to the immortal neck-biter also known as the Son of the Devil. No one needed this story. Yet Mehmed the Conqueror (Dominic Cooper) attempts to conscript 1000 Transylvanian boys to fight in his army -- and presumably to keep him in bronzer eyeliner and designer haircuts too. The conscripts include Vlads young son (Art Parkinson) so this work of tedious fan fiction forces a Faustian bargain The old cave-dwelling Roman emperor Caligula (Charles Dance) gives Vlad two days of superpowerful vampirism to gut the Turks and save the boys. If at the end of 48 hours Vlad has avoided the taste of blood he gets his mortality back and can resume making stressless love to the missus (Sarah Gadon). If not hes avoiding the sun forever. As a vampire Vlad morphs into hundreds of CGI bats that mow down thousands of invading CGI Turks. He waves his arms and poses to conduct his own bat army (cue the eye rolls from Wayne Manor). The big showdown between Vlad and Mehmed relies on silver serving as vampire Kryptonite (cue the eye rolls from every werewolf in America). Most of the time I found myself feeling like I was waiting for a turn with the gaming controls. Basically its just depressing to hear Dracula or Caligula or whoever say things like ""The worlds fate hangs in the balance"" as if what Stoker or ancient history had always wanted was to write a Dungeon Siege tale. In the end some ideas about faith blasphemy and mob rule get half-explored. Theres even a finale that sets up a sequel that looks so much better than the dull starchy one weve just watched that you dont know why they didnt just make that.

You know what the character is; you know where hes going. Downey plays Hank Palmer an amoral hugely successful defense attorney whose clients are all scumbags because he tells an indignant prosecutor ""Innocent people cant afford me"" (a great line admittedly). He and his wife are divorcing because she had an affair when he wasnt there for her and their daughter because he only cares about winning because he had a traumatic childhood etc. Then on cue comes a turn that forces him to face his past and question his own integrity -- to judge himself. His mom dies and he returns to his New England hometown his two damaged brothers and his estranged father (Robert Duvall) an esteemed judge who belittles what Hank does. When the judge is accused of a hit-and-run murder and the attorney is plainly incompetent guess who feels compelled to take the case? This is not by any means a bad movie. The script has its bright patches the setting is picturesque and the cast is full of actors youll want to see. The resolution of the murder case is unexpected (the victim was a murderous piece of trash) though it doesnt upend the basic cornball formula. (Hydrangeas represent purity.) But the film is nearly two and a half hours and director David Dobkin doesnt rise above the level of a proficient TV hack. (Dobkins forte is comedy.) The biggest surprise is how few sparks pass between the two first-rate stars. Duvalls role keeps him shut down mulishy passive and he and Downey dont act as if they share a bloodline or fraught past. The younger actor seems suitably awed by his venerable co-star but theres no echo of Duvalls craggy plainness or his sharp avian profile in Downeys bright-eyed glibness. The other actors give solid fat-paycheck performances -- the sort that enable them to do projects they care about. Vera Farmiga has a salty waitress turn as the gal Hank bailed on (they dont match up either) Vincent DOnofrio is the older brother whose baseball career Hank played a role in ruining and Jeremy Strong wanders in and out of the action as the addled younger brother whose incessant videotaping of events looks to be a factor in the climax. (It isnt but it factors into the dark corners of the familys past.) The showoff supporting performance is Billy Bob Thorntons as the prosecutor who comes from the big city largely to humiliate Hank. Thornton is sleek and beady-eyed his white hair swept back his demeanor brrrrry cold. The character is more complex than he first appears but for most of the film hes used as a slick villain to raise your blood pressure. A The thing to hang onto in The Judge is that small towns represent upright American values and that cities are where you go to toss away your moral compass. Also that Robert Downey Jr. likes to play slippery hipsters who realize the full extent of their aloneness and resolve to slip no more. If he isnt on some basic level boring the hell out of himself hes not the actor I think he is. Tagsmoviesmovie reviewthe judgerobert downey jr.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 10 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 10 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by David Dobkin Written by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque Starring Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Vera Farmiga and Vincent DOnofrio Classification 14A Country USA Language English A blue-chip cast struggles with an unwieldy script in The Judge a hybrid comedy family-reconciliation story and legal drama. Director David Dobkin best known for comedies such as Shanghai Nights and Wedding Crashers demonstrates his serious intent mostly by paint-by-numbers psychology and a ponderous pace. Robert Downey Jr. best-known in recent years for his Sherlock and Iron Man blockbusters stays on fairly familiar ground as a motor-mouthed Chicago lawyer Hank Palmer who specializes in defending the rich and guilty (""the innocent cant afford me""). For all his courtroom swagger hes an unhappy man. On the verge of divorcing his unfaithful wife he gets a call that his mother has died. After a chirpy exchange with his eight-year-old daughter explaining that only one grandparent is actually lifeless (""Grandpas dead to me. Its a figure of speech"") he heads back to his Indiana hometown for an unwanted family reunion.Henrys estranged father is Joseph (Robert Duvall) a.k.a. the Judge of the films title. The two mens differences obviously go beyond their different legal approaches (exploitative versus self-righteous) to some mysterious breach in the past. The old man treats Hanks siblings - his brothers Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) and mentally challenged Dale (Jeremy Strong) - like furniture. Hank is a barely tolerated enemy.An opportunity to mend bridges is soon provided. When the Judge is charged with deliberately running down a local low-life on the night of his wifes funeral he needs a good lawyer. Hank feels obliged to stay in town and help with the case. The subsequent combination of homecoming and murder investigation is a lot of material to fit in and it stretches the movie out like a sagging waistband to more than two hours and 20 minutes. Along the way the story allows producer and star Downey to engage in a succession of mano-a-mano encounters with good character actors Duvall DOnofrio Vera Farmiga as a still-smoking old flame and Billy Bob Thornton as a coxcomb rival lawyer.While the individual scenes are decently shaped they often seem to be fragments of different kinds of movies. The most promising of those threads is about the painful intimacy between a doe-eyed jumpily neurotic son and his flinty ailing father and in a scene or two The Judge is actually moving. Although its a pleasure to see the two Roberts sharing the screen together its too bad it couldnt have been for a more fulfilling reason.

(Photo Claire Folger)The Judge"" is an over-stuffed film the sort of movie that crams too much into too slight a story.Robert Downey Jr. plays Hank Palmer a hotshot Chicago lawyer who gets called back to his small Indiana hometown when his mother dies. Once there he immediately clashes with his hard-nosed father Joseph (Robert Duvall) the towns longtime judge.Its the old story of friction between a stubborn father and his rebellious kid and that might have been enough for a more subtle film. But instead as will happen with Hollywood movies complications are piled on.The chief one has the judge being arrested for running down a bad guy he once sentenced to heavy jail time. Of course Hank has to step in as his attorney. But no one -- including the forgetful judge -- knows whether hes guilty.So theres the legal thriller component but the thrills keep getting watered down with further distractions. Lets just say any film that has a high school romance rekindled hints of incest cancer professional baseball mental disability and repeated vomiting has too much going on especially when some things have no tie to the basic story.Vera Farmiga is wonderfully fetching as Hanks old flame but aside from re-enforcing the idea that Downey is a charming ladies man her character has little purpose. And does Hank have to have a camera-obsessed quirky brother? Not really but pile on.Then again Hank can have anything he wants because hes Iron Man. OK not really but hes basically got the same cocky charming smart-as-a-whip attitude as Tony Stark. A more focused film might have brought a more focused performance but ""The Judge"" is so loose that Downey relies on old tricks.TLongdetroitnews.comThe JudgeGRADE C+Rated R for language including some sexual referencesRunning time 141 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1xwcMpz MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/10/10/downey-duvall-judge-movie-review-long/16997003/,200,thejudge7,thejudge,detroitnews

"Review Duvall vs. Downey in The Judge argues for acting excellence - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Duvall v. Downey in The Judge argues for acting excellence The Judge Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews The Judge Starring Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall and Vincent D Onofrio. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews The Judge Starring Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall and Vincent D Onofrio. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan The verdict in The Judge is Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. are guilty of excellence in acting Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. are not only the boldface names attached to ""The Judge"" but their powerful symbiotic acting is the key reason to see this film.Playing an unapologetically estranged father and son whose two-way contempt runs so deep they can barely look at each other Duvall and Downey create a memorable mutual antipathy with echoes that go back as far as Raymond Massey squaring off against James Dean in ""East of Eden."" However as directed by David Dobkin from a script by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque this vivid and volatile core is often undercut by a weakness for middle-of-the-road sentiment and a desire to be all things to all people.Part Oedipal family saga part courtroom drama all old-school entertainment ""The Judge"" wants to be the first serious film by a director best known for such comedies as ""The Wedding Crashers"" ""The Change-Up"" and ""Shanghai Knights."" But crowd-pleasing tendencies honed over a decade of Hollywood work can be hard habits to break. Still however unwieldy the final result Dobkin and company deserve credit for helping Duvall and Downey create vibrant dramatic characters that involve the performers in rousing stem-winder ways. The Judge Claire Folger / Warner Bros. Robert Downey Jr. as Hank Palmer left and Vera Farmiga as Samantha Powell star in ""The Judge."" Robert Downey Jr. as Hank Palmer left and Vera Farmiga as Samantha Powell star in ""The Judge."" (Claire Folger / Warner Bros.) After playing Iron Man in four movies (with another ""Avengers"" due out next year) and Sherlock Holmes in two its Downey who benefits most obviously from a change of pace from having the chance to do something that reminds us that superhero arias are not the only notes he can reach.Downeys Hank Palmer starts out as someone Tony Stark could love or even potentially hire. A slick too-smart-for-his-own-good Chicago uber-lawyer Palmer can be counted on to deliver the best verdict money can buy. ""Innocent people cant afford me"" is the mantra of a man who glibly proclaims ""everyone wants Atticus Finch until theres a dead hooker in the hot tub.""

Clad in orange pants and a fitted pink-purple T-shirt Robert Downey Jr. put his feet up on a couch at a hotel here Thursday afternoon and minced no words in describing what it was like to shoot ?The Judge? -- a legal and family melodrama that takes Downey back to his roots -- during a phase when... (Steven Zeitchik) But behind the facade of a fancy house expensive Ferrari and even costlier trophy wife things are about to get more complicated for Palmer. Amid typical legal shenanigans he gets a phone call telling him his mother has died a phone call that drags him back to Carlinville Ind. the place he hasnt set foot in since he left 20 years earlier. A bucolic albeit fictional hamlet (filming was done in Shelburne Falls Mass.) Carlinville hasnt changed much in years which is one reason Palmer hasnt been back. That and a whole raft of buried family secrets and unfinished emotional business.Palmers brothers former athlete Glen (the always welcome Vincent DOnofrio) and Dale (Jeremy Strong) the innocent with a touch of Aspergers are still in town and are troubled by his long absence. Old girlfriend Samantha (a luminous Vera Farmiga) is also around and she has her issues as well.Towering above everyone in terms of influence and the buttons he pushes for Palmer is a father even he calls Judge.On the bench for 42 years the elderly jurist exceptionally played by Duvall is very much the law in these parts a mean snake who is fanatical about everything on and off the bench even which direction cars are going to be parked in his driveway.Palmer never one to mince words insists ""this familys a Picasso painting"" and he doesnt mean that in a good way. The attorney is determined to leave as soon as his mothers funeral is over but no surprise here circumstances conspire to keep him in town.What happens is this The judge goes for a late-evening drive on a rainy night and ends up hitting and killing a man with his immaculate 1973 Cadillac Coupe DeVille. Not just some random individual but an ex-convict the judge has had a particularly fraught relationship with. Was it an accident? Was it murder? The judge whos been having memory problems lately simply does not remember what happened.Obviously what the judge needs most is a good defense attorney especially after the state appoints black-clad Dwight Dickham (wonderfully played with a Lucifer-like intensity by Billy Bob Thornton) to be special prosecutor in the case.Given the situation hiring his son should be a no-brainer for the judge but if you think thats the case you havent been paying attention. The judge wants someone local ""someone with integrity"" and he fights his sons attempts to help every step of the way. And at 2 hours 21 minutes this film has room for lots and lots and lots of steps.Given the Hollywood nature of this production including high-gloss cinematography by Janusz Kaminski and an over-emphatic score by Thomas Newman softening plot elements are inevitable. The problem here is not that they exist but that they feel so overly familiar especially when they contrast with the honesty of the lead actors.Though Downey is excellent the 83-year-old Duvall is the standout here. The judge may sound like a standard-issue autocrat but Duvall who had to be talked into the role by his wife and his agent makes more of it than perhaps even he anticipated.Convincing playing an unadulterated despot as well as when he dials down the confrontations without vanity in his willingness to portray the physical humiliations of aging Duvall relishes being a force to contend with as for that matter does Downey. Yes ""The Judge"" could have been a better film but these two provide real and compelling reasons to see the one we have.Follow me on Twitter KennethTuran----------------------------------------The JudgeMPAA rating R for language including some sexual references.Running time 2 hours 21 minutes.Playing In general release.

"Judge The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; judge-the ) Judge The (United States 2014) October 09 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Two words that come to mind when considering The Judge are generic and predictable. Its also well-intentioned and earnest (perhaps to a fault). There are some good scenes and instances of strong acting but the project as a whole is so familiar that it feels like a collage of moments and scenes from other better films. Although there are times when it taps into a vein of heartfelt drama there are as many instances when it veers dangerously close to becoming manipulative pap. The films lack of ambition is distressing especially when one considers the quality of the actors involved. In fact there are times when the performances are good enough to overcome the screenplays inherent weaknesses but one cant help but wish the likes of Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Vera Farmiga Billy Bob Thornton and Vincent DOnofrio had been provided with something more worthy of their thespian abilities. This is an easy paycheck for them all an overlong crowd-pleaser that mistakes a hackneyed catharsis for something more meaningful. The Judge is yet another movie about a prodigal son coming home for the funeral of a parent. In this case the son in question is Hank (Downey Jr.) a hotshot big city lawyer whose return to his roots in rural Carlinsville Indiana is anathema to him. Still living there are his brothers (Vincent DOnofrio and Jeremy Strong) and his estranged father Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) with whom he hasnt spoken since leaving to make his reputation. While Hank is in town paying his final respects to Mom Dad is arrested for murder. The accusation seems laughable at first but as the facts emerge it becomes clear that more than the judges legacy is at stake. After initially rebuffing his sons offer to represent him the judge relents and Hank brings his experience and flair to Carlinsvilles biggest legal theater. The Judge is never really about whether Joseph is innocent or guilty. His crime (or lack thereof) is a red herring - an excuse to keep father and son together for a while and give them reasons to interact and remember the good times they had before their relationship frosted over. (These are primarily illustrated via old home movie clips rather than flashbacks although there are instances of the latter as well.) The movie features two themes the big city/small town culture clash that defines Hanks past and present and the healing of his fractious relationship with the judge. The ""mystery"" of what happened on the night of the murder is treated as a secondary concern. Director David Dobkin (Wedding Crashers Fred Claus) is a purveyor of lowbrow mainstream fluff and although this digs a little deeper than his usual fare it constructs interpersonal relationships out of clichA(c)s. The storyline is obvious and never veers from its expected trajectory hostile son returns home with a chip on his shoulder only to discover that though interaction with his family and an old flame he may have left behind his humanity when he hit the big time. In the meantime he goes through the process of reconnecting with his father. As far as it goes the story is reasonably well told but it doesnt go anywhere thats surprising or interesting. Robert Downey Jr. whos widely recognized as one of the half-dozen best actors currently working gives a performance thats a little too showy to be believable. He says all the lines conveys all the emotions and makes us laugh at his occasional jokes but we never fully lose sight of Downey Jr. Robert Duvall on the other hand inhabits the character of the judge fully and completely. His low-key intensity is in direct contrast with Downey Jr.s flamboyance. Some of the supporting actors give impressive turns in small roles an underused Vera Farmiga as Hanks ex-girlfriend Vincent DOnofrio as Hanks older sibling Billy Bob Thornton as the prosecuting attorney and Leighton Meester as a young girl with a possible connection to Hank. Its hard not to see The Judge through the same lens that one views the likes of August Osage County This Is Where I Leave You and even Nebraska all films about people who return to their roots after trying hard to forget where they came from. Due to its unwillingness to do the heavy lifting necessary to explore true emotions The Judge provides a lesser telling of this same basic story. To some extent the performances (especially those of Duvall and Farmiga) make this a journey worth taking despite the shortcomings but its hard to deny the frustration of seeing so little accomplished with the assembled talent. The Judge could have been great but its merely palatable.

Its less like a story than an oft-told fable or at least a simulation of one a set of familiar gestures meant to engage a set of audience reflexes and unconscious yearnings. Heres the star looking pensive in a shot held for several seconds - that alone is supposed to pierce us to the heart - while whimpery pop music plays. Here he is digging his old bike out of the garage and his old Metallica T-shirt out of the closet. Here he is embracing his mentally disabled younger brother (no Im not kidding) or strolling into the hometown bar now owned by his (extremely hot) onetime sweetheart.Once a famous Hollywood problem child Downey is now an A-list star which comes with its own set of risks. High among them is making this kind of ""star package"" movie which is simultaneously overstuffed with plot detail and not actually about anything. Can you make a movie starring Downey and Robert Duvall two of the finest living American actors as an estranged father and son stuff Vera Farmiga Billy Bob Thornton and Vincent DOnofrio into supporting roles and still have it turn out dreadful? Well the Hollywood dream factorys ability to spin gold into lead is legendary but ""dreadful"" is probably the wrong word. ""The Judge"" is watchable but thoroughly specious. Its dull and reassuring an infantile fantasy of homecoming and forgiveness set in a mythical version of America no one in the target audience has ever seen. Its two-plus hours expended on a dumbed-down version of the last book of ""The Odyssey"" with a few flashback references to some battles and monsters that dont matter anymore.Im sure Downeys agent and financial advisor urged him to make this film and Im also well aware of the industry calculation at work This kind of lightweight heart-warming melodrama in which both the star and the audience are ""protected"" - Downeys supposedly roguish character is never all that despicable and makes all the choices we want him to make precisely on schedule - plays well with audiences. Its ""what people want."" Whereas I say the hell with people and what they want. People also want fast food celebrity gossip and reality TV; they seem delighted to prostrate themselves before the national-security state and deliver every detail of their lives to any corporate entity with the right user interface. Just because they eagerly suck down second-chance fairytales in which all past sins are absolved and we all get another go-round at life and love doesnt make them healthy. You Might Also Like Its not exactly coincidence that Bill Murray another great actor with an uneven career arc has just made a version of the same story with ""St. Vincent"" also out this week. (Or for that matter that Jason Bateman Tina Fey Adam Driver et al. delivered the suburban-family ensemble take on this myth a few weeks ago in ""This Is Where I Leave You."") ""St. Vincent"" is a grittier more indie-flavored tale with Murray as a curmudgeonly Irish-American drunk Melissa McCarthy as his single-mom Brooklyn neighbor and Naomi Watts as no lie the Russian hooker with a heart of gold. While first-time writer-director Theodore Melfi crafts a more convincing simulacrum of realism than the Hollywood factory that produced ""The Judge"" -- and Murray as always supplies any number of small memorable moments -- he ultimately relies on the same defanged sentimentality. In both cases the end of the story is implicit in the beginning Downeys high-priced scumbag lawyer and Murrays misanthropic gambler and boozehound are never bad people only misunderstood (by others and by themselves). Indeed they are only people who have convinced themselves they are bad based on a faulty interpretation of the evidence. Since no one is actually bad all thats required is the intervention of the adorable tot hard-ass parent or hot chick who shows up to inform them they are in fact awesome. (Each of these movies has two of those three ingredients.) Its not like the fable of the scoundrel redeemed is some new idea and it wasnt new when Charles Dickens wrote ""A Christmas Carol"" either. But at least Ebenezer Scrooge really is a flint-hearted old miser who behaves abominably; it takes quite a bit of spiritual spelunking mingled with terror of the hereafter to reveal his injured Christmas-loving inner child. You could say the same of Jack Nicholsons Oscar-winning performance as Helen Hunts mean-spirited and homophobic neighbor 17 years ago in James L. Brooks ""As Good as It Gets"" which feels like the unacknowledged modern template for all such stories. Of course we come to Scrooge or to Nicholsons Melvin Udall hoping they will be redeemed by a sentimental education will right their wrongs and expiate their sins. But compared to todays pre-redeemed affection-swaddled semi-scoundrels - who make the long arduous moral trek from not-so-bad to awesome -- those guys look like Raskolnikov. We want the sentimentality without the education forgiveness without expiation; we want assurance that there are no evil people so that we dont have to consider whether we have tolerated them enabled them or become them.""The Judge"" and ""St. Vincent"" both open in theaters this week.

Warner Bros./Village Roadshow Warner Bros./Village Roadshow Warner Bros./Village Roadshow The Judge     (out of five) Director David Dobkin Cast Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Vera Farmiga Billy Bob Thornton Rated R (strong language including sexual references) Running time 141 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 415pm on Thursday Oct. 09 2014 Thursday Oct. 09 2014 Tuesday Oct. 07 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Judge a drama about family dysfunction and coming together under hard circumstances pulls at the heartstrings so hard and so long that it feels more like a tug-of-war.It centers on a pugnacious Chicago lawyer and prodigal son who after his mother dies reluctantly returns to his small Indiana town to face the wrath of an angry father who may be either drinking again or suffering mental decline. On top of that Dad may have accidentally killed someone. Then theres the adorable kid whose comfortable world may be upended by divorce and the mentally challenged brother whos obsessed with an old movie camera and its home movies.Theyre all here in this change of pace from director David Dobkin best-known for such light fare as Wedding Crashers Fred Claus and The Change-Up. And its all done in loud shouted you-cant-handle-the-truth tones that scream Oscar bait and for a long time; the film runs nearly 2 1/2 hours.Yet for all of that The Judge isnt totally disposable thanks to Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. who as the father and son at the center of the story give it a focus and an edge. Downey is Hank Palmer the kind of successful but morally bankrupt criminal defense attorney who makes ambulance chasers look like saints. He seems to have it all a booming career a fantastic house a hot sports car a gorgeous wife (Sarah Lancaster) and a beautiful precocious daughter (Emma Tremblay).But much of his life is tearing apart at the seams. He and his wife are in the midst of breaking up and then comes the news that his mother has suddenly died.That means going back home to see the family he long ago abandoned including working-class older brother Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) younger brother Dale (Jeremy Strong) who uses photography as a security blanket and dad Joseph a gruff but respected local judge who now finds himself on the other side of the bench.Just as Hank is getting ready to leave town after the funeral he gets word that his father has been involved in a hit-and-run. The prosecuting attorney (Billy Bob Thornton) is an old foe of Hanks and would like nothing better than to see the Palmer family go down.So Hank has to stay to defend his father -- and dredge up long-buried emotional baggage in the process. That includes the girlfriend (Vera Farmiga) he left behind all those years ago.Downey manages to pivot from the smart-aleck wiseacre at the beginning of the film -- which is basically a spin on his Iron Man sensibility -- to something deeper as the story progresses. But its Duvall as Joseph -- diffident difficult demanding and yet increasingly vulnerable -- who really gives The Judge a solid anchor to drop in this choppy family sea.Based on a script by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque The Judge has a few standout moments and these are generally when Duvall and Downey are on screen together.They may not be enough to counterbalance the bloat of the rest of the film but they keep it from sinking under the weight of soggy sentimentality.

"Review Robert Duvall Robert Downey Jr. save The Judge - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Robert Duvall Robert Downey Jr. save The JudgeBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 10/08/2014 021233 PM PDTUpdated 10/08/2014 021459 PM PDT Fans of Robert Duvalls acting and Robert Downey Jr.s personality (as much as I like him hes essentially playing Robert Downey Jr.) should go see ""The Judge."" It delivers a heaping helping of the two film dynamos trading emotional blows for more than two hours. Those who are turned off by family dramas with more cliches than some soap operas might want to see something else.But I dont recommend it. Despite a script that offers little we havent seen before Duvall and Downey obviously showed up to work with each other. And their chemistry is fantastic. The film itself is so-so on a par with the overrated ""Heat"" which was all about watching Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino interacting in one epic scene (before they both started making movies that didnt matter). (L-R) Robert Downey Jr. as Hank Palmer and Robert Duvall as Joseph Palmer and Dax Shepard as C.P. Kennedy in The Judge. (Claire Folger/Warner Bros. Pictures) Duvalls performance in ""The Judge"" is so compelling you start wondering when hes going to explode in a cloud of emotion and die on screen. He and Downey carry the film on their backs and its fun to watch even amid the cliched father-son conflict that will leave guys buried in their own daddy issues by films end.Well ... not me. But some guys.Downey plays big city lawyer Hank Palmer who is going through an ugly divorce while returning to his childhood home in a small Indiana town -- which by the way is more beautiful than anything Ive ever heard about Indiana -- for his mothers funeral.Advertisement He clashes with his past at every turn. His older brother (played stoutly by Vincent DOnofrio) had a promising baseball career cut short by a car accident attributed to Hanks irresponsibility. His younger brother (a likable Jeremy Strong) is developmentally disabled. His father Joseph Palmer (Duvall) is a local fixture -- a powerful and curmudgeonly local icon of a judge -- who has major issues with his son even though they have much in common. Joseph Palmer has another problem He may or may not have had something to do with the death of a man who came through his courtroom years before received a light sentence and committed another heinous crime. Suddenly Joseph needs the son he doesnt trust -- or like -- to keep him out of prison.This doesnt exactly sound like a laugh riot but director David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"") wisely exploits some absurd yet recognizable situations for at least five or six good belly laughs during the films first hour. He and writers Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque also understand the value of inserting a child into the mix -- in this case the very good Emma Tremblay as Hanks daughter -- who creates a nice storyline about what kind of father Hank will be in light of his own questionable upbringing.Billy Bob Thornton plays the prosecutor who seems more than equal to Hanks courtroom abilities and Vera Farmiga is the familiar ex-girlfriend who of course is more than willing to jump back into a romance with Hank. Anyone who has seen Downey play the smartest guy in the room -- a role in which he has excelled for decades -- will not be surprised by how his character reacts to being back in the small town in which he grew up.But all that matters is Duvall and Downey playing off of one another. You frequently know whats coming but that doesnt lessen the impact. In fact that these two are muscling their way through a flawed story makes their work all the more powerful. There were reports that Duvall initially turned down this script only to reconsider because he wanted to work with Downey. Good call. ""Judge"" wont win a best picture Oscar but watching the two of them make magic together on the big screen is more than worth the price of admission.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.The Judge   1/2Rating R (language some sexual referencesCast Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Vera Farmiga Vincent DOnofrio Billy Bob ThorntonDirector David DobkinRunning time 2 hours 21 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

(Claire_Folger/warner bros) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 9 2014 318 PM Title The Judge Film Info A lawyer must defend his father a judge in a murder trial. Director David Dobkin (221) R Language. Area theaters. If you were on trial youd want Hank Palmer there to defend you. With a lot of panache to throw around when he needs to Hank as played by Robert Downey Jr. is both a pit bull and a whippet. He bites he wins hes gone. But the point of the the entertaining satisfying new movie ""The Judge"" isnt for Hank to be larger than life. The mission of director David Dobkins family drama is to bring Hank down to earth -- and examine the uncomfortable past that often make successful people who and what they are. Hank is in the midst of a breakup with his wife. Hes called back from Chicago to his small Indiana hometown after the death of his mother. His older brother Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) runs an auto body shop. A younger brother (Jeremy Strong) has a mild mental impairment. Hanks father Joseph (Robert Duvall) is a tough local judge who still casts a shadow across his sons life. After the funeral Hank is eager for a fast getaway when the Judge as his sons call him kills a local man with his car while on a late-night errand. The victim was a man the Judge had exonerated years earlier but who took an innocent life shortly after. There is evidence the Judge while addled by the loss of his wife knew what he was doing. Robert Duvall gives another excellent performance in ""The Judge."" (Claire Folger) Hank stays in town to defend his father from charges brought by a tenacious prosecutor (Billy Bob Thornton). Soon Hank comes to grips with his emotional legacy and how its kept him from moving forward. He reconnects with an ex-girlfriend (Vera Farmiga). As the case comes to trial Hank faces his own high expectations of himself. There are echoes of 1970s and 80s films about family and professional life here. Think big movies like ""Kramer Vs. Kramer"" and ""Heartburn"" but also smaller ones like ""Nothing in Common"" and ""Crimes of the Heart."" Dobkin and co-writers Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque attempt and achieve a lot in this mainstream movie. Their script may seem overcrowded but it resonates with the unforeseen eventfulness of long-gone familial issues. People forever see their parents children and siblings as they were at one age with no room to grow. The film is shot in rich cozy tones by Janusz Kaminski and the actors bring their A-games. Farmiga lends the right level of mature quirky sexiness. Thornton is silvery and snake-like. And Dax Shepard has a nice turn as the anti-Hank a sweet but ineffectual local attorney. Robert Downey Jr. (left) defends his dad in ""The Judge""; Billy Bob Thornton (r.) plays the prosecutor. (Claire_Folger/Warner bros) Anchoring the ensemble Downey shows restraint on several levels. The lightning-witted persona is there but so is a willingness to show the level of disdain Hank has for where hes from. Theres no wink of affection behind the glibness. Downey mines the slick unlikability of the guy so that when he gains a new view of himself and his family the feeling is earned. This is a rock-solid fully committed performance. Speaking of committed Duvall at age 83 nearly steals the show. Always the most inscrutable of the great 70s actors Duvall uses his great unassuming American face to convey pride confusion pain and compassion -- sometimes all at once. Let the record reflect that heres a brave scrappy performance from an Oscar-winner who has nothing to prove.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 09 2014 at 400 PM updated October 09 2014 at 403 PM comments If snakes could strut Hank Palmer would stride with pride. An arrogant million-dollar attorney he takes gleeful satisfaction in simply demolishing his opponents without any fond illusions about ""justice."" ""Everybody wants Atticus Finch"" he says ""until theres a dead hooker in the hot tub."" His father has ideals though. His father is a small-town judge straight out of an ""Andy Hardy"" film. Except suddenly he becomes a defendant. And guess what sleazy lawyer becomes his defense counsel? That is the simple high-concept situation at the heart of ""The Judge"" and its sturdy enough to allow for more than two hours of sharp dialogue and great acting if not particularly inventive plotting. The movies an important one for star Robert Downey Jr. though who after reviving his career with two major franchises - first ""Iron Man"" (and all his marvelous guest appearances) then ""Sherlock Holmes"" -- seems ready to do some of the smaller simpler movies he used to make. True Downeys still careful to stay in his movie-star comfort zone here; Hank Palmer is very verbal quickly caustic and moistened with the balm of his own sweet self-approval. He is the smartest person in the room and he knows it and thats someone Downey has played many times before (particularly in his two blockbuster franchises). But he does get to show some cracks in that facade particularly in one big shouted scene with his father played by Robert Duvall. And Duvall -- whose judge it turns out has more than a little of ""The Great Santini"" in him -- delves deep into not only emotional vulnerability but raw physical frailty as well. Theres also a typically real and refreshing turn by Vera Farmiga as that woman from Downeys past and a small bit of lip-smacking acting by Billy Bob Thornton as a prosecuting attorney with a grudge. And the locations (supposedly rural Indiana actually small-town Massachusetts) are Saturday-Evening-Post lovely. Despite its country setting and warring attorneys the movie -- which has three credited writers -- is still a long way from ""Anatomy of a Murder"" alas. Some humor doesnt work and some incidents -- a teenage tragedy a disabled brother the Girl He Left Behind -- feel like desperately contrived third-draft inspirations. And while everything builds to the judges court case -- well the only surprise once that gets going is you may not be very surprised at all. ""The Judge"" is a movie that could have used a little more reality in its day-to-day details and a small dash of wild imagination in its climax. Its a bit too carefully worked out and cautiously produced. Still it is Robert Downey Jr. out of the iron armor. And good as he is in those movies acting to the special effects its a pleasant change to see him here -- back in a movie where the acting is the special effect. Ratings note The film contains strong language and sensuality. The Judge (R) Warner Bros. (141 min.) Directed by David Dobkin. With Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall.

Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures drama ""The Judge."" Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A small-town judge accused of murder turns to his son a lawyer for help. Rated R (language adult themes). BOTTOM LINE Duvall and a fine support cast add polish to what basically amounts to a courtroom soap-opera. CAST Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Vera Farmiga LENGTH 221 As the superheroes of summer fade from theaters the old-fashioned mystery is making a slight comeback this autumn. The genre may have peaked in the 1990s -- a golden era of Grishams and Turows -- but its back in various guises including last months ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" with Liam Neeson as a private eye and the upcoming ""Before I Go to Sleep"" starring an amnesiac Nicole Kidman. Perhaps this is Hollywoods way of competing with television a newly resurgent medium where the whodunit is still in fashion. Riding this wave is ""The Judge"" a straight-ahead courtroom drama in which Robert Downey Jr. (a co-producer) swaps his Iron Man armor for the bespoke suit of a Chicago defense lawyer Hank Palmer. Hank long ago left Carlinville Indiana where his estranged father Joseph (Robert Duvall) is a legendarily hard-nosed judge. When Joseph is accused of murder however Hank decides to act as counsel. Theirs is not the ideal attorney-client relationship ""I wish I liked you more"" Joseph tells his son. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""The Judge"" has a lot going for it particularly its top-shelf cast. Duvall may not be stretching as Joseph but the 83-year-old actor can still pack a verbal gut-punch. Downey likewise remains stuck in snarky Tony Stark mode but he excels at this kind of character -- brilliant cocky wounded. Backing them up are a terrific Vincent DOnofrio as Glen Hanks haunted brother and Vera Farmiga as Samantha Powell the girl that got away. Billy Bob Thornton plays Dwight Dickham a prosecutor with Midwestern charm but Satans beard. Though solidly directed by David Dobkin (shifting gears from comedies like ""Wedding Crashers"") and enlivened by smart dialogue (by Nick Shenk and Bill Dubuque) ""The Judge"" never amounts to more than a legal-themed soap opera. Family drama abounds -- an old car accident a mentally impaired brother (Jeremy Strong) a paternity question (Leighton Meester) -- but the trial itself holds few surprises and ends on an oddly unsatisfying note. While its good to know that character-driven dramas still have a place at the movies ""The Judge"" might have worked better as a television miniseries.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kristin Tillotson StribKristin When a lifelong smartass-turned-superhero dips an insolent toe into tear-jerker territory theres bound to be blowback. But thats a risk that Robert Downey Jr. the top-paid actor in Hollywood for two years running can afford to take. In the case of ""The Judge"" it pretty much pays off with a hefty assist from elder statesman Robert Duvall. As Hank Palmer a Chicago defense attorney as jaded as he is successful Downey trots out the fast-talking charming-jerk routine he can perform on autopilot. Hank returns home to small-town Indiana for his mothers funeral following years of estrangement due to a major rift with his crusty overly stern father the local judge. Instead of trying to heal wounds with his black-sheep son Dad (Duvall) makes devastating comments like ""I wish I liked you more."" Hank has more luck reconnecting with his brothers Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) a former baseball hero and camera-happy Dale (Jeremy Strong) hovering somewhere near the high end of the autism spectrum as well as his sassy high-school honey Samantha (Vera Farmiga). Hank is on a plane headed home when he finds out that Dad -- who happens to be keeping some mighty serious health secrets -- has run down and killed a bicyclist on a dark rainy road though he cant remember doing so. When the victim turns out to be a neer-do-well and long-ago nemesis the judge is charged with murder. Knowing that his fathers first choice for defense (Dax Shepard) is too green for the case Hank steps in facing an impeccably tailored formidably visaged Billy Bob Thornton for the prosecution. Things may wind up as you suspected they would creaky heartstring manipulations and all but getting there isnt entirely predictable. One scene in particular in which Hank helps the judge through an extremely vulnerable moment at home gutsily portrays chronic illness with the stark realism it is seldom afforded. ""The Judge"" is the first project for Team Downey a new production company RDJ formed with his wife Susan Downey. As the opening film at the Toronto Film Festival last month it got a critical reaction more tepid than it deserves. Watching these two powerhouses with opposite styles square off is worthwhile and the story is also more satisfying than any screen adaptation of John Grisham bestsellers has been thus far. Director David Dobkin previously known for such paeans of pathos as the callow comedy ""The Wedding Crashers"" may be a bit clumsy out of the gate with more sensitive material but wisely gives his seasoned cast a lot of rope. Warner Bros. Hank (Robert Downey Jr.) defends his father (Robert Duvall) in ""The Judge."" The script by Minnesota native Nick Schenk his first major project to see daylight since his 2009 breakthrough ""Gran Torino"" got a bit of a rewrite from newcomer Bill Dubuque but it might have been tightened up more. As fetching as Farmiga is to watch the extraneous flirtation takes up more than its share of screen time as does the forced insertion of a visit from Hanks endearing but unnecessary daughter stretching the film a good 20 minutes longer than it needs to be.

Robert Downey Jr. has become a reliable brand. Like Robert Duvall his co-star in the compelling new courtroom drama ""The Judge"" Downey does not play losers. So when Duvall as small-town judge Joseph Palmer is charged in a fatal hit-and-run accident Downey as a hot-shot Chicago lawyer is the perfect man to defend him.Trouble is the lawyer is Henry Palmer the estranged son of the judge.Henry is one of those cocky characters who never misses a wastebasket free throw brags that his wife has the body of a cheerleader and drives a Ferrari to his lake house. Years ago Henry put Carlinville Ind. in his rear-view mirror. But when his mother has a fatal heart attack he reluctantly returns to the little town where his father is the voice of authority. Accessories to the funeral include Henrys older brother Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) who silently blames Henry for a high-school accident that ended Glens hopes of a major-league baseball career; and simple-minded younger bother Dale (Jeremy Strong) who may be the last person on earth who not only uses an 8mm movie camera but knows where to develop the film.The Dale character is emblematic of the overkill employed in this too-long movie albeit effectively. Other examples of surplus subplots include Henrys troubled marriage and his relationship with his cutesy young daughter (Emma Tremblay) who implausibly has never met her paternal grandparents; and Henrys reunion with an old girlfriend (Vera Farmiga) who may or may not have borne a now-adult hottie (Leighton Meester) to whom Henry is attracted. But even as the old judge is wheezing with infirmities that force father and son to make amends this is ultimately a judicial drama. Yet its one where the outcome is unusually doubtful. The father has cancer and his chemotherapy causes memory lapses so its never clear whether the judge deliberately struck a bicycle-riding reprobate on the rainy night after the funeral. ""The Judge"" was directed by David Dobkin whose best-known film is the comedy ""Wedding Crashers"" so even in a serious vein its consistently entertaining. Much of its success is due to the combustion between Downey and Duvall. We cant fail to notice that these two bulls butt heads like Cruise and Nicholson in ""A Few Good Men"" and the fact that its father-vs.-son ups the ante.Despite playing with a stacked deck ""The Judge"" is guilty of exceeding expectations.What ""The Judge""  Three stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 211  Content Strong language and some sexual references Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Comments click to enlarge The Judge Video Rated R  141 minutes  2014 A prince-of-darkness defense attorney in Chicago (Robert Downey Jr.) returns to his Indiana hometown to bury his mother and winds up defending his estranged father (Robert Duvall) a respected judge in a fatal hit-and-run case. The leads are typecast to perfection--Downey glib and aggressive Duvall principled and crotchety--but the legal drama is freighted with stale family and interpersonal conflicts and the comic relief is unfortunate (Dax Shepard as a country lawyer who pukes before every crucial court session Jeremy Strong as a mentally impaired man dispensing idiot one-liners). This is one of those films that uses home-movie footage as shorthand for an idyllic past; its a telling cliche indicative of a writer whos blind to any reality he hasnt seen projected onto a screen.

"The Judge review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review The Judge  1/2 The Judge Claire Folger/Warner Bros. (L-R) Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall and Dax Shepard in ""The Judge."" (L-R) Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall and Dax Shepard in ""The Judge."" (Claire Folger/Warner Bros.) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Hotshot Chicago attorney played by Robert Downey Jr. goes back to small-town Indiana to improve his character. Of the 141 minutes in ""The Judge"" roughly 70 work well hold the screen and allow a ripe ensemble cast the chance to do its thing i.e. act. The other 71 are dominated by narrative machinery going ka-THUNKITA-thunkita-thunkita. This is the same sound a clothes dryer makes when a half-dozen John Grisham hardcovers are tossed in with an iron-plated movie star and 30 pounds of rocks.Even when it clutters up the story the script by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque takes every opportunity to flatter its protagonist Hank Palmer played by Robert Downey Jr. who also served as one of several executive producers. Hank is a hotshot Chicago attorney famous for his loose ethics and wily courtroom ways. Hes a whiz literally; in the opening scene Hank urinates on a rival lawyer in a mens room in a way director David Dobkin (""Wedding Crashers"") wants us to take as charmingly combative. However life is crumbling all around Hanks glib bubble of an existence. His marriage is kaput and hes threatening to sue for custody of his preteen daughter. Then Hanks mother dies which necessitates a dreaded trip back home to southern Indiana to fictional Carlinville where the adorable downtown waterfall suggests nothing vaguely in or even near the Midwest. (The exteriors were filmed in Shelburne Falls Mass. among other Massachusetts towns.) Trapped in his hometown Hank attempts to make nice with his estranged father the feared local judge now a widower played by Robert Duvall.And then comes the movies hook. The old man is accused of hit-and-run murder requiring Hank to swallow his pride and step up to defend his father against a clever prosecuting attorney portrayed by Billy Bob Thornton. ""The Judge"" deals with various sorts of second chances and redemption scenarios. Some of the detours pay off; others are loose flaps. With a legal procedural filmmakers can get away with an overgenerous running time and an overpacked story for one simple reason Audiences know a courtroom finales due to arrive shortly. Its the family scenes that lift the material above its station. Hanks brothers are played by Jeremy Strong (effective in a drecky holy-fool stereotype of a role) and Vincent DOnofrio who is terrific as always. Really terrific. Wish-the-movie-was-about-him-not-Robert-Downey-Jr.-terrific. Vera Farmiga is the cafe owner who knew Hank when and who busts his chops with a wolfish grin every time he comes sniffing around the diner.The best of the fractious domestic clashes in which old grievances and resentments come to the fore give ""The Judge"" a jolt of juicy melodrama. Then theres the very best portion of ""The Judge"" leaving melodrama behind for a truer plainer brand of human frailty. The Duvall character whose health is failing undergoes some serious challenges and theres a sequence when the imperious judge must accept Hanks aid in a particularly compromising situation. Suddenly ""The Judge"" transforms into a different darker better film. And Downey elsewhere unable to shake the aura of a supercool movie star slumming in a ""character-driven"" personal project finally loses some of the self-regard and meets Duvall on his wavelength.

Honest in some ways it also has just enough schmaltz to make viewers pull back precisely when theyre supposed to surrender fully. Sometimes sentimental is simply another word for predictable. ""The Judge"" despite many virtues follows a pattern. Better to think of it this way as a collision between Robert Duvall and Robert Downey Jr. -- or rather their personas -- thrown together in a scenario in which they must pretend to be father and son. In one corner we have the irresistible force that is Downey the mile-a-minute speech the glib facade barely concealing a vulnerable core. And in the other we have Duvall the father no one wants at least no son an implacable and belligerent know-it-all who has the unforgivable habit of often being right. Can they be themselves on screen those selves weve come to know in detail and yet seem like members of the same family? The answer is yes at least once you remember that baldness is inherited from the mothers side. In fact this is a very good film for both of them a rich and rare showcase for Duvall 83 and an opportunity for Downey to remind people that hes really an actor and not just a blockbuster fixture. It must be lots of fun writing dialogue for Downey ""Everybody wants Atticus Finch until theres a dead hooker in a hot tub."" He plays Hank a top lawyer who has come a long way from his Indiana childhood and he may have come some distance from himself as well. Hes a workaholic specializing in keeping white-collar criminals out of jail and he has a trophy wife who is dumping him for one reason or another. Maybe he wasnt nice to her. Or maybe he picked the wrong person. His mothers death brings him to Indiana for the funeral which means reuniting with his father whom he doesnt call ""Dad"" or ""Pops"" but ""Judge."" That says it all. Then just when he is about to leave the Judge is arrested for running a guy over with his car and Hank decides to stay and try to keep his father out of prison. Much of the story concerns the preparation for the case but thats really just the framework for the movies real area of interest which is the family. Director David Dobkin might not be the subtlest of directors -- he actually has the entire courtroom gasp at one point -- but he and his fellow screenwriters avoid the obvious trap of making moral judgments. Hank isnt really in need of reform and the Judge isnt a complete self-righteous blowhard. Somehow ""The Judge"" gets into a rhythm in which its perfectly acceptable for scenes to linger. The 141-minute running time feels right. Vera Farmiga makes a strong impression in the modest role of the girl Hank left behind now all grown up and working at the diner. The moment she appears its like a neon sign flashing ""Move back to Indiana."" Vincent DOnofrio and Jeremy Strong also lend good support as Hanks older and younger brother respectively each troubled in his own way. But the best thing about ""The Judge"" is watching Downey and Duvall as actors playing off each other. They listen and react and take lines and moments to places that surprise us and seem to surprise them. Its especially good to see Downey so unguarded lashing out letting the emotion rise without comment. Beethoven once went five years without composing. Until now Downey has gone five years without making anything close to a serious movie. The bigger waste of time was Beethovens but talent wasted is talent wasted. This is the type of film Downey should be making. Mick LaSalle is The Chronicles movie critic. E-mail mlasallesfchronicle.com Twitter micklasalle The Judge Drama.

Entertainment Inc. Robert Downey Jr and Robert Duvall in The Judge. Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall lend their high-powered histrionics to a courtroom drama that tests some knotty family ties A judge may be deeply suspicious of the defense attorney in his court. One is sworn to dispense justice the other bent on finding every legal loophole for clients to slip through. Hank (Robert Downey Jr.) a brilliant schemer of a Chicago lawyer defends the guilty because ""Innocent people cant afford me."" Judge Joseph (Robert Duvall) a veteran judge in rural Indiana has only contempt for such wily rule-bending. ""Imagine a faraway place where your opinion matters"" he tells Hank when the younger man shows up in Josephs jurisdiction. ""Now go there."" That Joseph Palmer and Hank Palmer are father and son and have been estranged for much of their lives is the first selling point of director David Dobkins The Judge a courtroom drama of antagonistic family values. The second and more pertinent attraction is the pairing of two exemplary actors Downey who has holidayed from his early eminence (and notoriety) by playing Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes in a half-dozen fantasy blockbusters and Duvall the flinty patriarch of modern American cinema. Downey spits out dialogue at auctioneer speed; Duvall lasers that killer stare like a male Medusa or flicks a lizardly smile which is even more chilling. Their collision-combustion strikes the expected sparks in a movie thats not quite worthy of the occasion. Billed as a heavyweight championship bout The Judge is more a middle-of-the-card time-passer. Like Ben Afflecks Nick in Gone Girl Hank has come home from the big city for his beloved mothers death. His two brothers -- the older crippled Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) and the younger slow-witted Dale (Jeremy Strong) -- greet him warmly. Not so Joseph whom all his children call Judge perhaps because he laid down his stern law to them instead of lifting them with his love. An Old Testament type secure in both his moral righteousness and his judicial rectitude the Judge lavished affection only on his late wife and his 71 Coupe de Ville... because as we know from Gran Torino The Bucket List and the new St. Vincent every codger needs a vintage car. Hank cant stand his dad and has stayed away from him. As he explains to his 10-year-old daughter Lauren (Emma Tremblay) ""Grampa Palmers dead to me."" Grampa may be facing death because of a ride he took in his old Caddy. In the screenplay by Nick Schenk (who wrote Gran Torino) and Bill Dubuque Joseph becomes a suspect in the hit-and-run demise of one Mark Blackwell (Mark Kiely). Years before the Judge had given a light sentence to Blackwell who then committed a particularly heinous murder. The events left a blot of regret on the Judges conscience; the dead man left his bloodstains on the fender of that Coupe de Ville. When arraigned the Judge hires local doofus lawyer C.P. Kennedy (Dax Shepard) as his counsel but to mount a compelling defense against the slick prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) he will require a really clever advocate. Hmmm whos available? Maybe his hated son whos ready to take the job because he says hes a little light on his pro-bono work this year. Dramatizing a murder trial in a small town with intertwined guilty secrets The Judge keeps wandering into territory staked by Harper Lee To Kill a Mockingbird. There are no racial overtones since the Palmers live in quite the whitest part of Indiana. But Hanks mentally challenged brother Dale is an obvious clear avatar of Mockingbirds Boo Radley (whom Duvall played in the 1962 movie). Hank also alludes to Lees lawyer hero when he drily notes ""Everybody wants Atticus Finch until theres a dead hooker in the hot tub."" The blood on the Judges car is his dead hooker. Dobkin who directed Vince Vaughns sharpest comedy of the past decade (Wedding Crashers) and his worst (Fred Claus) moves to drama with a slower rhythm -- The Judge runs or ambles at a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes -- but the same nudging of the audience double-takes from the actors a sudden storm during a big confrontation the Thomas Newman score that points at the rise of any emotion like a grade-school teacher wielding a yardstick. Clever scenes like Hanks psychoanalyzing prospective jurors by asking what messages are on their bumper stickers alternate with pokey detours. Hanks old girlfriend Samantha (Vera Farmiga) is still in town... and she has a daughter (Leighton Meester)... who might be Hanks Fine but can we get back to the trial? The movie also goes heavier on bodily functions than an early John Waters film. In an early scene Hank accidentally-on-purpose pees on the pants of a rival attorney. C.P. the Judges first lawyer is so nervous as he approaches the courtroom that he vomits every morning. You start to wonder whether Dobkin is going to resurrect the joke about the old man who goes to his doctor. (Doctor tells him ""Ill need a urine sample a stool sample and a semen sample."" Old man says ""Here take my underpants."") Instead he turns a moment when Hank intrudes on the Judges pathetic incontinence into a strange strong affirmation of the father-son bond. As the Judge inches toward death he becomes as helpless as a baby and Hank is suddenly the parent cleaning up his childs mess with a combination of duty embarrassment and love. Farmiga does small wonders with a thankless character the wise weary hometown girl who would be more comfortable in a Larry McMurtry multigenerational saga. Thornton is precise ruthless and interestingly unknowable in the out-of-town prosecutorial sharpie role taken by George C. Scott in Anatomy of a Murder (a much sturdier small-town courtroom drama). Theres also Grace Zabriskie in the Grace Zabriskie role the crazy lady she played on Twin Peaks and Big Love. But you came for Downey and Duvall and you get a lot of what theyve got to give. Amazing that Duvall was in his forties when he first played lawyer Tom Hagen -- and that first Godfather movie was more than 40 years ago. At 83 hes old enough for false teeth but hes still got his chops; the Judge needs just a single bite to leave wounds on his ambitious sons ego. Downey 49 might consider Hank pro-bono work between headlining in his big franchises even though those movies flatter his strength of lending a comic touch to overbearing geniuses. His character in The Judge -- as in The Soloist and Due Date Downeys only two other non-action-film leading roles of the last six years -- has affinities to Stark and Sherlock hes a bright tense guy whom the plot compels to come to the aid of people he might otherwise despise. The odd thing is that these days this accomplished serious actor looks more comfortable in fantasy roles. He does fine as Hank when ladling out the spit and sarcasm. But in the quieter moments hes sometimes like a race car being gunned in neutral. Hes never Acting so much as when hes Being Human. Touching on home truths about justice and the law aging parents and their balky children The Judge launches enough emotional pyrotechnics to satisfy most audiences. They may overpraise it because it reminds them of older better movies. Wouldnt it be lovely to see a modern version of Mockingbird or Anatomy of a Murder? Even the update of a solid John Grisham suspenser like The Client A Time to Kill or The Rainmaker? Its tempting to lay the tissue of a cherished old movie on a new film of similar intent and our vision clouded by nostalgia for a favorite genre see its retro appeal. Years from now we may even apply that retro glow to this movie. Well think of its upmarket stars and honorable ambitions and wonder ""Why dont they make movies like The Judge any more?"" The answer They do but on TV network law shows. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

During the middle of a trial he gets a call His mother has died so he must return to his hometown of Carlinville Ind. for the funeral. He returns with reluctance because he hasnt been back since a falling-out with his father Joseph (Duvall) a no-nonsense judge respected and feared and maybe a little hated by the good folks of Carlinville.But he goes and has the reunion with his father he was expecting awkward and uncomfortable. He also sees his brothers Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) a once-promising pitcher who runs a tire store and Dale (Jeremy Strong) who is mentally challenged in the worst possible movie way.

(Photo Warner Bros.)Hank plans to head out of town the day after the funeral but the night before Joseph is involved in a car accident and then later charged in a fatal hit-and-run. Increasingly damning details make this look even worse for Joseph than originally feared. Hank goes back and forth over whether he wants to defend him and Joseph goes back and forth over whether he wants the help -- there are massive egos and a lot of family history at play here -- but given the context of the movie its not a spoiler to say that eventually Hank sticks around.On his downtime Hank makes out with a bartender (Leighton Meester) which is creepy and just gets creepier and with his old flame Samantha (Vera Farmiga).When hes on the job he bickers with his father about their planned defense (Hank knows all the tricks of the trade while Joseph trusts the system to play out fairly) and we slowly learn some of the details that have made this family so twisted.Once the trial starts Hank spars with Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) the prosecutor who has little sympathy for the judge who has handed out harsh discipline for decades.Its during those scenes of conflict -- Hank vs. Joseph Hank vs. Dickham Hank vs. himself -- that the movie takes off. These are superb actors and watching them go at it is far more rewarding than sifting through the predictable tale their characters are mired in. Sure these roles arent exactly a stretch with Duvall being crotchety and Downey being sharp-witted. But that familiarity is part of the appeal. Theyre good at this. Really good.After all as has been noted theyre not movie stars for nothing.AZCENTRALThe Judge (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe JudgeDirector David Dobkin.Cast Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Vera Farmiga.Rating R for language including some sexual references.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Downey plays Hank Palmer a big-city lawyer who brags that innocent people cant afford him. But oh no his wife is leaving him because hes totally married to his job he doesnt really know his daughter and on top of that his mom just died. Time for yet another middle-aged rich white dude to go back to his small-town roots reconnect with the girl he left behind and learn some valuable life lessons along the way. The drama such as it is comes from the titular judge who is also Hanks cranky old Dad (Robert Duvall). His Honor was awfully hard on wayward teen Hank way back when (BUT WHY?) and now he stands accused of taking out an old enemy on the day of his wifes funeral. Storm clouds gather A dimwit brother accidentally splices scenes of a family tragedy into old Christmas movies The past is dug up and shouted about Downey does his doe-eyed best to make you play along and the writing picks up a bit about halfway through. But its just not worth the 140 minutes. 2014. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters. Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Comments Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 711 p.m. EDT October 9 2014Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall in a scene from the motion picture ""The Judge.""(Photo Claire Folger Warner Bros. Pictures)It seems an injustice but riveting courtroom thrillers are increasingly rare at the movies.Perhaps because viewers can watch such superbly crafted legal dramas on TV as The Good Wife movies are lagging behind on this front.Mired in red herrings and time-wasting sidebars The Judge is a classic example of a second-rate courtroom drama ( out of four; rated R; opens in select cities Thursday night and nationwide on Friday).Its well-acted with some occasional moments of clever dialogue but the story is plodding predictable and tension-free. If the essential premise doesnt work it doesnt matter what terrific actors are cast.Clocking in at a hefty 2 hours 22 minutes the melodramatic film resorts to filler and extraneous sub-plots that undercut the story of an embittered son and his estranged father.USA TODAYToronto A mixed start for The Judge?Robert Downey Jr. plays Hank Palmer the hot-shot criminal-attorney son of irascible small-town judge Joseph Palmer portrayed by Robert Duvall. No one plays ornery old cuss better than Duvall. But hes done it so often that his role feels overly familiar. Downey does acerbic wit with ease. Not surprisingly the best scenes are between these two superb actors.Hank has a successful law practice in Chicago as well as a precocious daughter (Emma Tremblay) and a philandering wife. When he goes home to Carlinville Ind. for the funeral of his mother Hank endures the communitys resentment for having left for the big city as if no one ever had the temerity to do so before. His older brother Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) had dreams of playing baseball and now runs a local store. His sweet younger brother Dale (Jeremy Strong) is cognitively impaired but loves shooting Super 8 movies paving the way for a gimmick used unconvincingly to depict a pivotal car accident involving his older brothers.The self-righteous judges dislike for his slick son has kept Hank from visiting. We later learn the full dimensions of the lifelong enmity between father and son though it still doesnt ring terribly realistic. Though it takes a while to get there the story centers on a fatal car accident in which the increasingly forgetful judge has struck and killed a recent parolee. He winds up on trial for murder.Hank had been planning to leave town after his moms funeral but his fathers murder charge changes his plans.From the moment it happens the audience knows Hank will end up defending the curmudgeonly judge -- even though the older man resists irrationally. Due to bad plotting theres essentially no mystery about what happened though the film tries to create tension with hoary cliches including loud gasps in the courtroom and trumped-up revelations.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Big city lawyer Hank Palmer played by Robert Downey Jr. returns to his childhood home where his father the towns judge is suspected of murder. Hank sets out to find the truth. VPCMost supporting parts feel incidental or forced. Vera Farmiga plays Samantha Hanks high school girlfriend and the owner of a local diner. She brings her limited role more soulfulness than was likely in the script. But its still not very compelling. A sub-plot involving her college-age daughter Carla (Leighton Meester) is unnecessarily queasy. Billy Bob Thorntonplays a silver-haired prosecutor who sneers his way through the trial.Oddly for a film aimed at adults it includes gross-out moments worthy of kids movies such as repetitive scenes of vomiting outside the courthouse by an inept local attorney (Dax Shepard). Perhaps these were inevitable since the film was directed by David Dobkin who made the hilariously irreverent Wedding Crashers and the lowbrow comedy Mr. Woodcock.However one scene in which father and son deal with the indignities of old age is starkly moving. The Judge had decisive potential. But a weak script lack of subtlety and tonal inconsistencies impede what might have been a powerful family drama. 76 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1vRkCdZ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/08/the-judge-review/16452845/,200,thejudge26,thejudge,usatoday

Like a court case that ends in unanimous conquest for the defendant The Judge is a perfect movie--provocatively written intensely mounted painstakingly photographed passionately acted and profoundly thoughtful. Equal parts courtroom drama legal thriller and family saga its also a synchronized duet for two terrific actors at the top of their craft that left me stunned. THE JUDGE  (4/4 stars) Written by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque Directed by David Dobkin Starring Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall and Vera Farmiga Running time 141 min. Looking healthier and handsomer than ever Robert Downey Jr. plays Hank Palmer an arrogant cynical Chicago defense attorney who returns home to a small town in Indiana for his mothers funeral and stays just long enough to open old scar tissues and rekindle old conflicts with his estranged father (Robert Duvall) an irascible local judge and pillar of the community whose implacable values and judgmental dynamics have kept his three sons divided and in turmoil for years. Vincent DOnofrio as the resentful older brother Glen who never left home and Jeremy Strong as the mentally impaired youngest brother Dale both cower under the domineering control of their father known to everyone simply as ""The Judge"" but Hank clashes openly with the old man. Neither of them has a talent for saying what they really feel and it is obvious that they will never reconcile. Hank is about to fly home when a shocking crisis erupts. The Judge is accused of the hit-and-run killing of a man he once sentenced to prison suspended from the bench and tried in the same courtroom where hes been dispensing justice for decades. Under the circumstances Hank is forced reluctantly to take over the job of defense attorney in the resulting murder trial with his own father as a client--an awkward position that pits him against a crafty out-of-town prosecutor played by Billy Bob Thornton. Its a tough case that uncovers damning evidence and Hanks father is no help at all. ""Imagine a far away place where people value your opinion"" he says to his son who is now also his lawyer ""and go there"" Watching helplessly while the wheels of law drag on the trial Hank thought would be a no-brainer heads in the wrong direction his fathers health fails and he develops a gradual compassion for The Judges predicament. Mr. Duvalls bravery and honesty as a method actor of unusual grace pays off constantly. An intimate scene where the son washes his fathers wrinkled and sagging frame and tends to his bodily functions is especially affecting. Mr. Downey matches him without pause. Sensitively directed by David Dobkin the screenplay by Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque is intelligent touching and carefully calibrated eschewing any trace of sentimentality yet the film envelops your own sense of humanity as father and son draw closer and discover things about each other they never suspected. Beautifully lensed by the great Polish cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Saving Private Ryan Schindlers List) every shot is suitable for framing and the film is enhanced by a smashing cast including a small but sincere contribution by a bottle-blonde Vera Farmiga as an old girlfriend of Mr. Downeys. Its Mr. Duvalls greatest performance since he won the Oscar for Tender Mercies and Mr. Downeys greatest performance ever. The actors are so powerful and explicit with truth they kept me glued to the screen with awe. The Judge is what they mean when they say they dont make em like that anymore.

Is that a terrible thing to say? Actors like the rest of us grow old and there arent a whole lot of good roles available to them. But do we really need to see Robert Duvall playing a withered grouch for the millionth time? Theres only so much squintin and grousin an audience can bear and in David Dobkins The Judge -- a Midwestern drama in which bits and pieces of John Grisham courtroom showmanship bump up against Alexander Payne-style family angst -- Duvall reaches new exhausting depths of cootery. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - He plays crabby patriarch Joseph Palmer a respected small-town Indiana judge who has raised three sons two of whom he seems to not actually hate. Palmer treats tire salesman Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) and sweet simple Dale (Jeremy Strong) with something like benign indifference. The kid who drew the short straw is Robert Downey Jr.s Hank a hotshot big-city lawyer known for keeping obviously guilty thugs out of jail -- though hes also got a soft side being the sort of guy who wears a white-collared blue shirt and a hippie string bracelet with his regulation lawyer suit. Hank never looked back after leaving the family homestead one of those gracious old houses with a porch invitin you to set a spell. But his mothers funeral draws him back and as if that werent painful enough he also finds himself square in the beady-eyed gaze of old Josephs seeming hatred.It turns out though that Daddy Palmer might need the help of the son he reviles After possibly going on a bender -- hes been sober for years -- the judge finds himself a suspect in what may be a vehicular homicide and the case against him is strong though the movie fails to make us understand why. The plot mechanics of The Judge make little sense at least given what we know about small middle-American towns either from actually living in them or from watching lots of movies about them. To spell out the details would give too much away but when I confessed my confusion about certain twists and behaviors to a colleague he turned to me with the patient solemnity of a grade-school civics teacher and said with a sigh ""What youre failing to grasp is that in the heartland people are honest and pure; they believe in justice. Its only in the big city that corruption and personal motives sully the purity of the law.""Film Details The Judge RatingR GenreDrama Running Time141 More Info Trailer I stand chastened. But I still wouldnt want to sit through The Judge again. Dobkin made his name with comedies like the cheerfully disreputable Wedding Crashers and even better the stupendously birdbrained Shanghai Knights in which Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson erased cultural barriers by speaking their own language of brilliant non sequiturs. The Judge has its funny moments but is far more serious at heart and much more of a slog too. Hefty chunks of it take place in the courtroom where Billy Bob Thornton shows up as a skinny bulldog of a lawyer theres a tepid love-interest angle involving Vera Farmiga as Hanks high-school girlfriend -- her eyes rimmed very precisely with small-town tough-gal eyeliner circa 1989 -- but The Judge is really mostly about healing the wounds of father-son relationship trauma. Downey is just the kind of guy you might think you would want to see in this role Hank has a wisecrack for every occasion but because Downeys playing him we also see the years of ""Love me Daddy"" pain pooling in the dark soulfulness of his eyes.Still nothing Downey does here is unexpected or even all that moving. Clearly the idea was to match two great actors from different generations and both come out swinging all too wildly. Duvall is terrific in the movies quieter scenes particularly one in which his character doesnt know hes being watched As his wifes coffin sits gleaming in the cemetery waiting to be put into the ground forever he stands alone beside it talking to the friend and helpmeet who is no longer there. Before walking away he reaches out to pat the polished wood and the words that spill out of his mouth only half-audibly are ""Bye. Bye-bye.""Thats what Duvall at his best can do. But most of The Judge shows Duvall at his worst screwing up his face in locust-cloud disgust whenever his most unloved son dares to challenge him or crumpling into a total cutie-pie when his granddaughter Hanks little girl (Emma Tremblay) asks him if hes going to take her out for an ice-cream cone. Note that The Judge does feature a few well-drawn scenes that capture the truth about caring for an elderly parent -- its hardly a pretty business definitely not for the faint of heart. But for every minute of stark honesty dozens more feel forced as when Joseph humiliates Hank whose wife has cuckolded him by cackling over the way she ""played hide-the-pickle with someone else."" Thats a knee-slapper all right -- you almost expect Duvall to chortle like Walter Brennan. Its just one example of how The Judge could use better judgment.Directed by David Dobkin.

With The Judge 90s nostalgia--a force that will not stop until the rivers run sickly green with Surge--finally breaches the best-fortified stronghold of middlebrow culture the mid-budget ensemble flick. Styled as a throwback to the leather-upholstered courtroom thrillers of the Clinton era the movie casts Robert Downey Jr. as Hank Palmer a slick Chicago lawyer who returns to his Indiana hometown for his mothers funeral and then finds himself trying to defend his semi-estranged father Judge Joseph Palmer (Robert Duvall) against a murder charge. Trying is the operative word here because Judge Palmer makes no secret of the fact that hed rather Hank hop on back to the big city and foregoes his sons pro bono counsel in favor of hiring an inexperienced local attorney C.P. (Dax Shepard) who practices out of the back of an antiques store.In essence The Judge is a combination of two very heavily codified genres the Grisham-esque legal drama with its lawyers divided by idealism and profit and the small-town homecoming movie with its assorted could-have-beens and ones that got away. Hank--whos preparing for a messy divorce and custody battle back home--finds himself rekindling a romance with Samantha (Vera Farmiga) the high-school girlfriend he abandoned two decades earlier. There is the familiar equation of the hometown with a perpetually frozen past with every character stuck in some kind of stasis father and son unwilling to let bygones be bygones; Samantha still working at the same diner; local criminals still harboring grudges against the judge for convicting them; Hanks older brother Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) still living in the aftermath of an injury that cost him a pro baseball career; intellectually disabled younger brother Dale (Jeremy Strong)--embarrassingly played for bathos and comic relief--and his fixation on re-editing and watching 16 mm home movies of their happy childhood. Home never changes; neither apparently do movies about homecomings. The problem with this kind of over-familiar material--which trades in popular stereotypes about small-town life inept local cops and all--is that it cant help but seem inauthentic and unspecific. (It doesnt help that some of the regional details--like the idea that Northwestern grad Hank has never heard of C.P.s alma mater Valparaiso--are just plain wrong.) The movies fuzzy clouded 35 mm textures and severely diffused lighting which come courtesy of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski are handsome but they never seem anything more than artificial. One can almost hear the put-put-put of the smoke machine just out of frame when Hank sits down with the judge in his home office. And yet the movie isnt without its pleasures most of them related to performance. Farmiga a perennially underrated actor gives Samantha a measured confidence that sets Hanks manic cockiness on edge and Billy Bob Thornton does an effective variation on a slimy archetype as the prosecutor Dwight Dickham. This is however Duvall and Downeys movie to carry. For the most part both actors are doing shtick--Downey as the sarcastic and self-aware charmer Duvall as the straight-talking but emotionally distant old codger--but its so well developed with both making the most of their signature cadences that it rarely matters. Sometimes as in a scene where Hank finds his father collapsed in the bathroom they even get to act.

I knew exactly how he felt. It is evident from the first scene in David Dobkins ""The Judge"" that this is going to be a big movie with big performances about big feelings. There are moments that have all the grace and subtlety of housebreaking a dog - Dobkin rubs your face in his emotional mess ensuring that he gets his point across. Watching home movies of happier times shot by your innocent (and vaguely-defined mentally challenged) younger brother as Bon Ivers ""Holocene"" goons on the soundtrack? On clackety Super 8 mm no less? I can think of no more contrived moment in a movie this year. ""Expendables 3"" has fewer nauseating cliches than ""The Judge."" Downeys character whom well call Tony Stark Esq. is a big jerk but thats only because his father was a big jerk. His father the Judge (Robert Duvall) is really into playing by the rules and is a respected member of his small community. But the night after his loving wife passes away he gets into an accident killing an evil town creep who represents his careers worst disgrace. Was this this vehicular manslaughter with intent or was the old man so stricken with grief that he didnt know what he was doing? And why does the Judge not remember anything from that night? I can assure you that the answers to these question are entirely disinteresting as is most everything else in this picture. But it is not wholly without merit. Theres a certain schadenfreude to watching a movie where a storm brews in the distance knowing that no hackneyed visual metaphor will go to waste. Indeed pere et fils end up standing in the middle of a tornado screaming their thoughts at one another artlessly slipping in backstory along the way. When Downeys character was younger he got in a car wreck ruining his older brothers (Vincent DOnofrio) baseball career. Oddly the brother doesnt seem too upset (or the scene of him venting got cut - you never know) but by the time this is revealed the movies plot machinery is in full motion. This domestic drama has turned to a courtroom battle. Downey will defend the man he most despises (but also wants a hug from.) Evil Billy Bob Thornton is the prosecutor and hes going to bring the hammer of justice down on the Judge. (How evil is Billy Bob? He brings his one of those silver flattening water cups you see in camping stores and when he opens it it sounds like a sword coming out of a scabbard. That evil) Theres a stray reference to Atticus Finch as if we werent already thinking of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" with Duvall in a courtroom drama. Comparisons dont do ""The Judge"" any favors - a wise editor would have stricken it from the record. And yet the performances arent horrible. Downey can do the slick narcissistic bit in his sleep by now but he does get in a few good jokes. Duvall gets good mileage out of his icon status and the scenes of him succumbing to old age are striking. There is in fact one scene of the two men dealing with the indignity of physical human frailty that is no joke quite good. It is one of the few show-dont-tell moments and is a mix of sadness and humor - a rare blip of humanity in a script that is otherwise completely by the numbers. If only the rest of the movie was sharp enough to go for realism instead of a pre-rehearsed cross-examination meant to establish and force feed empathy to an easily swayed jury.

Photo Claire Folger MOVIE REVIEW The Judge Solid popcorn fare. Running time 141 minutes. Rated R (profanity). At the Lincoln Square the Chelsea others. JUST watching snarky Chicago lawyer Robert Downey Jr. spar with crotchety father Robert Duvall as he tries to defend the small-town Indiana jurist on a murder rap is worth the admission to the overlong and sometimes schmaltzy -- but still hugely engaging -- comedy-drama ""The Judge. Theres indeed much to enjoy as newly widowed Duvall a stickler for the law initially disdains the flashy tactics of his cynical son who specializes in defending guilty white-collar criminals. The old jurist goes so far as to retain a bumbling Dax Shepard (who overdoes the local yokel bit) as his attorney. But Downey springs into action when hotshot special prosecutor Billy Bob Thornton (restrained for him) arrives to present a strong case that Duvall deliberately ran over a nasty murderer who had just served a 20-year sentence meted out by the judge. The old man doesnt remember what happened -- and Downey assumes its because the long-abstinent judge has fallen off the wagon following the death of his wife which is what brought the reluctant Downey home and face-to-face with his estranged dad in the first place. The real reason for the judges confusion is much much sadder and presented in a fairly graphic manner in one scene. When he isnt swapping insults with Duvall (both entertainingly trading on their familiar screen personas) Downey is renewing his acquaintance with childhood sweetheart Vera Farmiga. She has a randy law-student daughter (a briefly seen Leighton Meester) whose father incidentally may be Downey. Downeys character also has a young daughter -- hes suing her mother for custody -- who arrives for a visit to meet her grandfather for the first time. Vincent DOnofrio Robert Downey Jr. and Jeremy Strong in a scene from ""The Judge.""Photo Claire Folger There are also complex family dynamics involving Downeys long-suffering older brother (a fine Vincent DOnofrio) once a hot baseball prospect whose career Downey ended in a youthful automobile accident of his own. Now a married father DOnofrio is also the caretaker for his and Downeys mentally challenged younger brother (Jeremy Strong) who might as well be called Boo Radley Jr. (referencing Duvalls role in ""To Kill a Mockingbird). Director David Dobkin is known for comedies like ""Wedding Crashers but in truth here he makes a more credible stab at darkly comic family drama than last years similar ""August Osage County. I wouldnt be at all surprised if Oscar winner Duvall gets his seventh nomination for this his best role since 1997s ""The Apostle."" The script Dobkin collaborated on (with Nick Schenk of ""Gran Torino and Bill Dubuque) certainly goes overboard on occasion -- like throwing in a tornado for superfluous emphasis and multiple endings that drag things out well past the two-hour mark. The picture-postcard views (courtesy of Steven Spielbergs longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) of the Indiana town Downey reviles (actually Shelburne Falls Mass.) also seem strangely at odds with the story. Still ""The Judge is solid popcorn fare thats far more covncing in its criminal particulars than say ""Gone Girl -- and its great to see Downey released from his Iron Man suit even if this role is no less form-fitted to his motormouthed talents. And I wouldnt be at all surprised if Oscar winner Duvall gets his seventh nomination for this his best role since 1997s ""The Apostle.""

"The Judge is about a fathers sin and a sons quest for salvation review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Judge is about a fathers sin and a sons quest for salvation reviewThe Judge a courtroom drama of family and legal entanglements makes for a dandy TIFF gala opener and also an excellent reminder of the dramatic talents of Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 5 2014The JudgeGala world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Starring Robert Downey Jr. Robert Duvall Billy Bob Thornton and Vera Farmiga. Directed by David Dobkin. 124 minutes.The Judge a stirring courtroom drama of family and legal entanglements makes for a dandy TIFF gala opener and also an excellent reminder of the dramatic talents of Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall.As rapacious Chicago lawyer Hank Palmer who specializes in getting wrist slaps for wealthy clients (""Innocent people cant afford me"") Downey is the antithesis of Atticus Finch Gregory Pecks noble lawyer in To Kill a Mockingbird a movie that resonates within this one. Duvall was in that 1962 courtroom classic and hes the title star of this film playing Hanks estranged father Judge Joseph Palmer.Article Continued BelowYet when Hank finds himself back in his Indiana hometown defending his father on a murder charge -- Judge Palmer is accused of mowing down a despised former defendant -- hes forced to confront not only family ghosts but also the dark spirits of his current existence which include marital strife and absentee daddy issues with his young daughter. Robert Downey Jr. left and Robert Duvall star in The Judge the opening film of the Toronto International Film Festival. They star as as judge being defended for murder by his estranged son.  (Claire Folger / THE CANADIAN PRESS)  The courtroom is a familiar setting for Downey who has played lawyers in several movies and also in the TV series Ally McBeal. He could have easily just phoned this one in relying on his whip-smart banter (or ""verbal vomit"" as Vera Farmigas romantically inclined character Samantha calls it). But its clear that Downey wants to remind us that hes got more going for him as an actor than the heroic antics of his Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes blockbuster franchises.Duvall may also have been anxious to sink his teeth into a role that really challenges him. Hank Palmer may not be immediately likeable but Judge Palmer is downright nasty -- especially towards Hank the one son of his three (the others are played by Vincent DOnofrio and Jeremy Strong) whom he seems to actively despise for reasons not immediately made clear.""I wish I liked you more"" Judge Palmer snarls at Hank. The judge does have his reasons hes just lost his wife of many years the original reason for Hanks return to the small hometown he long ago left in the rearview mirror. Judge Palmer is also evidently suffering from memory loss possibly indicating the start of dementia or other debilitating disease.These are hard days for the Palmer family and they become all the more so when a man the judge had reason to wish dead is run over and killed on a dark country road and damage and bloodstains on Judge Palmers 1971 damaged Cadillac Seville match the crime-scene evidence.Long considered a pillar of legal righteousness in his community Judge Palmer now must decide whether to use his sons courtroom acumen to try to dodge jail or man up and explain the details of what seems to the local cops an open-and-shut case of murder.Murder is also the theory pursued by hotshot prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) who has no qualms about putting a judge behind bars.The Judge could have been just another courtroom procedural with extra family pathos but its got a third person with something to prove director David Dobkin who is better known for comedies such as Wedding Crashers and Fred Claus. A quick study on drama he brings an eye for detail and small comic touches to the film which unfolds as a satisfying saga of a quest for personal and familial salvation -- and maybe also for awards consideration.The Judge is bathed in so much golden light its as if Dobkin and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski were cutting their Oscar highlights reel right in the camera. But such moments are perhaps needed in a film with so many closed doors and shadowed hearts.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

This marks Downeys first non-comedy or superhero outing since The Soloist in 2009 and while this is better and far more mainstream than that misfire the actors box-office record in straight dramas remains spotty suggesting a moderate commercial life for this Toronto Film Festival opening-night attraction. Delving into a serious vein in films for the first time after making his name in comedy with the likes of Shanghai Knights Wedding Crashers Fred Claus and The Change-Up director David Dobkin conscientiously battens down every hatch to the point where spontaneity has been trumped by an over-calculated fastidiousness. Every dot and comma in the script by Nick Schenk (Gran Torino) and first-timer Bill Dubuque from a story by Dobkin and Schenk has been tended to just as the small-town Indiana setting looks manicured to a fare-thee-well. Downeys hotshot Chicago lawyer Hank Palmer is anything but sympathetic a slippery customer known for defending ""only the rich and guilty"" a guy whose obvious quick wit has soured into attack-mode glibness. At the outset however hes sobered a bit by the double whammy of his wifes infidelity and the death of his mother which sends him on what he intends to be a quick visit home his first in a very long time. As in any family drama that aims for emotional eruptions and third-act closure of a sort there are skeletons in every closet resentments in every pocket and regrets that must bubble to the surface. Hanks brothers are big man Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) a once-promising ballplayer whose major league dreams were thwarted and Dale (Jeremy Strong) the runt of the litter whose mental incapacities leave him little to do but obsess over the familys home movie collection. Then theres their dad (Duvall) the imposing patriarch everyone calls ""Judge"" due to his eminent career on the bench dating back more than four decades. Although they theoretically share an interest in the law Judges preoccupation with justice stands in distinct relief to Hanks obsession with winning which is just the professional aspect of the strain between the two gifted men. ""This familys a f--ing Picasso painting"" Hank remarks at the wake before heading out to drink with his brothers at the local bar where he ends up making out in a phone booth with frisky young waitress Carla (Leighton Meester). Little does he know that shes the daughter of his high school flame Samantha (Vera Farmiga) who later comes on strong as if they have some decades-old unfinished business that must be tended to immediately. Just as the locale looks like a Disneyland version of small-town America Farmiga looks way too glam for her surroundings. Other events also conspire to keep Hank downstate longer than he anticipated. Judge who takes his first drink in 28 years upon his wifes funeral shows signs of uncharacteristic memory loss; a local lowlife confronts Hank in the bar and soon after is found dead on a highway; Judges car is banged up from an accident and blood is found on it and it turns out the victim was a man Judge once sentenced to 20 years. Before long theres no way around it Everything points to Judge having been the driver who hit the guy on the road turning the towns role model of respectability into a possible criminal -- the real question being did he do it on purpose or accidentally? Never above a sarcastic jibe Hank allows that since hes ""a bit light in [his] pro bono service this year"" hell agree to join the defense team to help out local greenhorn lawyer (Dax Shepard) whos hardly equipped to take on the smooth prosecutor (Billy Bob Thornton). Increasingly as attention shifts from Hanks superior attitude toward his family and hometown to the complexity of local politics and Judges deteriorating physical condition and potential culpability Duvalls character and performance come into their own. Proud and never one to acknowledge weakness Judge must finally confront his frailties and mortality and there are several father-son scenes of considerable intensity that ask both Downey and Duvall to go places they have seldom gone onscreen physically and emotionally. Even when the circumstances seem contrived the actors mine moments of truth that resonate with raw emotion. Through rough battles with disease and the law the two men achieve a closeness that stubbornness and normal times did not foster. Even more than usual cinematographer Janusz Kaminski lays on the backlight flare very thickly often distractingly so. Thomas Newmans score is emotionally obvious and indulges the films pokey pace. Meanwhile posh Massachusetts locations stand in unconvincingly for the Indiana farmland setting.

Gavels are slammed tempers are lost and bowels are evacuated with great force in David Dobkins ""The Judge"" an engrossing unwieldy hurricane of a movie that plays like a small-town courtroom thriller by way of a testosterone-fueled remake of ""August Osage County."" Some elements ring truer than others in this ambitious blend of dysfunctional-family melodrama and legal procedural but all of them are just about held together by the ferocious onscreen chemistry between two Roberts (Duvall and Downey Jr.) playing an overbearing father and a black-sheep son who find their already tense relationship literally put on trial. Refreshing as it is to see Downey step out of the Iron Man suit for a spell the jurys still out on whether an impressive talent roster can draw enough grown-up eyeballs to this overlong resolutely old-fashioned male weepie set for release Oct. 10 by Warner Bros. For all the creakily elaborate Tennessee Williams-meets-John Grisham machinations cooked up by screenwriters Nick Schenk and Bill Dubuque (working from a story by Dobkin and Schenk) ""The Judge"" pivots on a simple yet inspired stroke of casting pitting Duvalls iconic gravitas against Downeys razor-sharp wit and then supplying no shortage of opportunities for both men to chew the scenery. Given that their characters are members of a legal profession that invites all manner of verbal pyrotechnics and rhetorical showmanship the actors are all too happy to oblige. A brilliant unscrupulous Chicago defense attorney who excels at getting white-collar criminals off the hook Hank Palmer (Downey) is preparing to end his marriage and sue for custody of his 7-year-old daughter Lauren (Emma Tremblay) when he receives news of his mothers passing. Reluctantly he heads home to Carlinville the sleepy Indiana town he swore hed never return to after falling out years ago with his dad Judge Joseph Palmer (Duvall) an irascible old coot and pillar of moral rectitude who couldnt be more disapproving of his son the slick big-city operator. Absence has not made either mans heart grow fonder and the tensions are laid on so thickly right at the outset -- lawyer vs. judge town vs. country etc. -- that viewers may feel ready to strap themselves in for a two-hour-plus marathon of familial misery. Yet Dobkin steers us entertainingly enough through the Palmers past resentments and present recriminations and the script is quite effective at summing up years of embittered history with a single cutting exchange. Josephs grieving-widower status doesnt stop him from seizing every opportunity to remind Hank what a disappointment he is especially compared with his reliable older brother family man Glen (Vincent DOnofrio) and his mentally challenged younger brother Dale (Jeremy Strong) a regrettable Boo Radley stereotype who wanders around filming everyone with an old movie camera. The presence of DOnofrio in the cast provides an early tipoff that things are about to veer into ""Law amp; Order Criminal Intent"" territory. Just when it seems Hank is ready to leave Carlinville for good Joseph gets arrested and charged with a hit-and-run murder -- an allegation that becomes even more serious when it turns out the victim is Mark Blackwell (Mark Kiely) a criminal lowlife whom the judge had particular reason to loathe. Joseph a self-described ""recovered alcoholic"" claims to have no memory of the night Blackwell was killed and Hank knowing his father will need the best defense possible decides to stick around. But Joseph scorns the tricks of Hanks trade and instead retains the services of an ineffectual local attorney (a bumbling Dax Shepard) convinced that the truth will prevail on its own -- even when notoriously tough prosecutor Dwight Dickham (Billy Bob Thornton) is brought in to try the case against him. Much of the pleasure of ""The Judge"" derives from the way Joseph and Hank clash over the proper way to handle their defense carefully negotiating the thorny legal and moral ramifications of the case then weighing them against their own difficult history and the sad fate that could await Joseph in the few years (maybe months) he has left. And the two leads superbly convey the complicated dynamic of a father and son who for all their differences are united by their colossal stubbornness fierce intelligence and unwillingness to suffer fools gladly. Neither actor is really attempting a change of pace here and the material plays to their strengths and distinct personas at every turn -- whether its Duvall laying down the law so to speak or Downey letting loose with a withering takedown of Carlinvilles white-trash population. That makes it all the more affecting on those rare occasions when Joseph and Hank achieve an honest moment of emotional connection informed by their dawning awareness of the indignities of old age and the inevitability of death. Duvalls performance his most memorable in some time carries unmistakable echoes of the many broken-down hard-drinking hermit-like men hes played in movies past yet never before has the 83-year-old actor rendered so painfully honest a portrait of a man whose body and mind are slowly failing him. In an ambitious departure from such aggressively raunchy studio comedies as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Change-Up"" (although like that film ""The Judge"" does feature a memorable excrement explosion) Dobkin displays a nice sense of dramatic modulation here informed by a keen understanding of the way family tensions tend to gather erupt and then dissipate. Still the director tends to overplay his hand whenever a heated confrontation comes along whether its an over-studied image of father and son going their separate ways across an open field or an argument whose melodramatic intensity is matched only by the gale-force winds outside their window. Once the final verdicts are rendered and the consequences are doled out the film goes regrettably soft as it seeks to tie up the various loose ends in the process bringing Joseph and Hanks relationship to the most sentimental conclusion imaginable. Still better all this father-son Sturm und Drang than a forgettable subplot involving Hanks attempts to rekindle an old flame (Vera Farmiga) and his brief flirtation with a sexy young bartender (Leighton Meester) whos studying law. Along with Hanks cheatin wife (a blink-and-you-miss-it performance by Sarah Lancaster) thats about as rich and complex as the female roles get -- not a huge surprise for this simmering cauldron of wounded male egos and latent daddy issues but a disappointment nonetheless. DOnofrio adds a welcome voice of sanity as the most likable and long-suffering of the three Palmer brothers while Thornton acting for the umpteenth time opposite Duvall (whom he directed in ""Sling Blade"" and ""Jayne Mansfields Car"") makes Dickham a wily and formidable opponent without turning him into an exaggerated villain. Elsewhere the always underexposed Grace Zabriskie is aces in a small but vivid role as the hit-and-run victims enraged mother. Fitting Dobkins heightened ambitions the technical contributions are considerably more accomplished than in the directors prior efforts. Janusz Kaminskis 35mm cinematography lends a depth of polish to the picture lensed primarily in the historic Massachusetts village of Shelburne Falls whose waterfalls provide lovely background distraction at certain moments. Thomas Newmans score manages not without strain to accommodate the films gradual shift from glib comedy to brooding dramatics. Film Review The JudgeReviewed at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank Calif.

Daniela says September 25 2015 at 1019 am This was one of the best movies I have ever seen I can watch it over and over and never get sick of it. Downey was absolutely incredible and sexy and power oozed out of his pours while seeing the sentimental side of him. I love DOnofrio but not used to seeing him so week. Just used to the ""MAN"" in Law and Order. Duvall.....just awesome Reply MovieBuff says June 14 2015 at 914 pm The acting by Robert Downey Jr. and Robert Duvall was beyond being superb. Their portrayal of a dysfunctional family and relationships between father and son with so much baggage mixed with positive earlier child hood memories was pretty much down to what some family relationships are like and only comes back strong in being a ""family"" when there is sickness and/or death and time to bring closure to reduce the ""regret"" list. Both Roberts acting were so realistic absorbing and true to the storys characters both should have received an Oscar nomination for their parts. Lately the movies and roles/actors being picked by Academy Role Institution for nominations or picked as winners seem more political. Ive seen more movies reaching the nomination list that are so lousy and do not have quality of the acting storyline and dialogue of the The Judge. Reply Alanmod says June 13 2015 at 920 pm My God..... The film industry offers the quentsctial perfect Drama and We cant grasp it at an embryonic level Im drowning .please.... Help Me Reply Bee says September 17 2014 at 812 am This was not a great movie to kick off TIFF its a real middle of the road generic movie but it made all the age defying 40 something ladies wearing their daughters 5 inch heels to the premier go nuts for RDJ I cant believe we still have movies with big city lawyer characters anymore its like super lazy writing. What makes it worse is that one scene in the bathroom. Speaking for characters this movie has those to spare yet they forgot to add a female to the mix so they tacked one onto the film for no reason but to have a sort of love interest. Its totally ok because the exposition told us that his wife was bad and cheated on him even though he is super awesome. This way we dont have to feel bad when the two leads get together sort of. It hits all the focus group points so somebody is going to enjoy it If you every knew anyone with CANCER this movie has it to identify with its got a DEAD MOM and an STRAINED RELATIONSHIP WITH A FATHER like some people have and if you dont have that well RDJ is SUPER RICH AND GETS ALL THE LADIES so you want to be like him. Why am I writing in caps? well its because if they are going to bludgeon you with these points I should too. In short weak forgettable movie with high production values. Not bad not good just there. Reply Robyn Wh. says September 5 2014 at 1258 pm The story is powerful as the actors a refreshing change that examines the vulnerabilities of ego driven men who are forced to go within to find each other. Looking forward to this film congratulations Reply therealeverton says September 5 2014 at 1210 am ""Refreshing as it is to see Downey step out of the Iron Man suit for a spell"" Guess you missed the 7 (SEVEN) non Iron Man roles he has played since Iron Man then?
