"Fifth Estate The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fifth-estate-the ) Fifth Estate The (United States/Belgium 2013) October 19 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Perhaps the most curious and counterproductive aspect of The Fifth Estate the so-called ""Wikileaks movie"" is the decision by director Bill Condon and screenwriter Josh Singer to establish the film as a thriller. The material covered in the productions 128 minutes is not only inherently non-cinematic but not remotely ""thrilling"" at least in the conventional sense. Condon does his best to amp up the energy level and there are individual scenes when he succeeds but the movie as a whole works best during its quieter more dramatic moments. The inclusion of tangentially related subplots (featuring the likes of Laura Linney Stanley Tucci and Alexander Siddig) create suspenseful capsules but ultimately seem so disconnected from the overall narrative that they serve as distractions. The Fifth Estate contains some worthwhile material most of which is related to Benedict Cumberbatchs mesmerizing multi-faceted performance. Since exploding on the scene in the BBC-TV series Sherlock Cumberbatch has become typecast as an intellectually cold emotionally stunted off-kilter individual. Its a quality he has brought to most of his recent roles including a turn as Khan in JJ Abrams Star Trek into Darkness. Perhaps the reason is that Cumberbatch is so good at playing this type of personality. His skill is in evidence here; his interpretation of Julian Assange is that of a man who is many things at one time mad prophet sincere visionary egomaniac charismatic guru narcissist. The Fifth Estates thriller aspects emerge from Assanges inflated sense of self-importance and his evolving paranoia. The films structure is haphazard but in the main it tells of the rise of Wikileaks from an obscure website run by a man with a strict code that includes promoting free speech (at all costs) demanding transparency from big companies and protecting sources. In the early-going Assange is a heroic figure a Robin Hood for the information age. Finding the task of running Wikileaks to be too big for one person he brings aboard Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) whose book forms the basis of the screenplay. Together Assange and Berg score their first big coup the February 2008 revelations of illegal activities associated with the Swiss bank Julius Baer. After that they become involved in cat-and-mouse games with various government and legal agencies that try (usually without success) to stop the release of ""sensitive"" information. As Wikileaks grows Daniel becomes increasingly concerned about Assanges methods. The two eventually split in 2010 when Assange after partnering with The Guardian The New York Times and Der Spiegel releases more than 90000 U.S. classified documents without redacting the names of operatives thereby putting lives in danger. Helped by two other members of Assanges staff (Moritz Bleibtreu and Carice van Houten) Daniel attempts to shut down the site. The Fifth Estates portrait of Assange is fragmented; in many ways hes a secondary character since the story is presented through Bergs eyes. The ""real"" Assange rarely comes to the fore although there are times such as a scene where he confides feelings of guilt and loss about neglecting his teenage son in favor of his ""commitment"" to Wikileaks when Condon shows a glimpse of the man behind the image. While Assange comes to life largely through the Herculean performance of Cumberbatch Berg isnt as lucky. Daniel Bruhl (recently seen in Ron Howards Rush) isnt as dynamic an actor and Berg often fades into the background. This is a problem since one of the films cornerstones is the often-stormy relationship between Assange and Berg. Three subplots clutter the proceedings. One involves Laura Linney Stanley Tucci and Anthony Mackie as U.S. government employees trying to deal with the Wikileaks fallout. Another focuses on Alexander Siddig as a source in Lebanon whose life is placed in danger by Assanges refusal to redact names. And a third peeks behind-the-scenes at The Guardian where top editors played by David Thewlis and Peter Capaldi figure out how to disseminate information being fed to them by Assange. Of those three only The Guardian segments work within the overall context. The other two belong in a different movie and when those characters are on screen viewers may feel like theyre watching a different movie. Assange has gone to great lengths to discredit the movie. Considering that its portrayal of him is less than flattering thats not surprising. The story closely follows the source material but there are open questions about the factual accuracy of those books. Condon uses a late scene in the movie to address Assanges criticisms by having the character as played by Cumberbatch complain about ""the upcoming Wikileaks movie."" Its a curious moment that seems to have been incorporated as a concession. Its the first time I can recall (at least in a serious-minded film) a character openly referring to the movie in which he is appearing. Cinematic recursion. I prefer to think of Condon as the filmmaker behind Gods and Monsters rather than the man responsible for Breaking Dawn. The intent of The Fifth Estate is a return to the earlier more serious films. The misstep isnt the subject; its how the subject is presented. As a thriller The Fifth Estate is strangely inert with a lot of movement but little in the way of genuine suspense. There are frequent shots of computer screens and numerous information-providing subtitles. The saving grace is Cumberbatch whose overwhelming screen presence almost makes the films flaws fade away. Almost that is but not quite.

Frank Connor Dreamworks Photo DreamWorks The Fifth Estate Director Bill Condon Cast Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl Rated R (strong language some violence) Running time 124 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 452pm on Thursday Oct. 24 2013 Thursday Oct. 24 2013 Friday Oct. 18 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Fifth Estate director Bill Condons involving look at the life of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is light years away from his recent work -- the hunky werewolves and sparkly vampires of The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Parts 1 and 2. And thats a good thing.A throwback thriller The Fifth Estate doesnt rely on the clockwork predictability of chases and explosions that has marked the genre these days. Instead it unfurls as a quietly compelling political drama reminiscent of 70s classics like The Conversation and The Parallax View.But The Fifth Estate is also as current as a news feed filling in the disputed facts about Assanges life beyond the headlines and chronicling the revolution that has upended the media landscape in the last decade. ( Assange himself has come out against the film calling it ""a massive propaganda attack."")The result is one of the years most engrossing movies a work not only of filmmaking skill but one that manages to walk the razors edge between celebrating what Assange says hes about (the free flow of information) and painting him as a complex and troubled man one riddled with paranoia arrogance and deep family issues.The film begins in 2010 just as The New York Times The Guardian and Der Spiegel were about to publish redacted versions of secret American diplomatic communications they received through WikiLeaks. From there the film goes back a few years when Assange (a convincing Benedict Cumberbatch Star Trek Into Darkness) was just another hacker with a dream. He preaches to his fellow travelers in the online underground that they need to be doing more important work rather than engaging in electronic mischief and gaming. And he tries to sell them on the notion that WikiLeaks is dedicated to throwing light on the darkness of government and corporate skullduggery. Thats why hes releasing previously secret documents photos and video on the Internet. He persuades a wide-eyed computer geek Daniel Dornscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) to join him and -- after exposing banking scandals in Iceland and corrupt elections in Kenya -- the site begins to make its mark.In 2010 when WikiLeaks releases footage of a 2007 Iraqi airstrike by U.S. forces and secret documents regarding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan the world really begins to take notice. Assange becomes a global figure.Through it all Assange is portrayed as smart and idealistic but also cunning demanding and cruel. As he begins to exert more control over Daniel its easy to see the effect that being raised in an Australian cult called The Family had on Assange. (Apparently according to the film The Family required that children in the group dye their hair white a practice Assange continues.)The interplay between Assange and Dornscheit-Berg -- beginning with admiration and ending in hostility -- is fascinating. The film written by Josh Singer is partly based on Dornscheit-Bergs book Inside WikiLeaks My Time With Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website so its no surprise that Assange comes off the worst. Also not portrayed in the best light is the mainstream media specifically Englands The Guardian whose journalists show nothing but contempt for Assange and his work.Condon handles what is essentially a war of wills and words with a keen visual eye making even a moment such as WikiLeaks being hacked and disabled into something cinematic.All in all it makes for a gripping account of recent history -- no vampires required.

The montage starts with hieroglyphics races through the printing press shows an exhausted Walter Cronkite pronouncing President Kennedy dead and Peter Jennings announcing the fall of the Berlin Wall. If the rush of images represents some of the overall Fourth Estates finer moments this film about the rise and stumble of WikiLeaks and founder Julian Assange takes a moment to ask an age-old question When does a founders personality taint his or her bold even revolutionary invention? Compelled by these questions director Bill Condon delivers an intelligent dynamic character-centered drama. Benedict Cumberbatch brings tightly wound -- but also wounded -- energy to his portrayal of the white-haired Australian who as a boy had been part of a New Age cult known as the ""The Family."" When ""The Fifth Estate"" begins Assange is about to hold a triumphant press conference. The New York Times The Guardian and Der Spiegel simultaneously published portions of WikiLeaks documents from the war in Afghanistan. It was 2010 and the newspapers would coordinate two other major publication events based on WikiLeaks documents. But much of ""The Fifth Estate"" unfolds before that press conference. For a deeper tutorial consult director Alex Gibneys indispensable documentary ""We Steal Secrets The Story of WikiLeaks"" (available on DVD). But it too tussles with the impact of charisma and a cult of personality on an organizations mission. Cumberbatch finds a fine counterpart in Daniel Bruhl who portrays Daniel Domscheit-Berg. In fact the movies point of view is Bergs who officially meets Assange at the hipster/hacker gathering the Chaos Communications Congress in 2008. Its Bergs book ""Inside WikiLeaks My Time with Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website"" along with David Leigh and Luke Hardings ""WikiLeaks Inside Julian Assanges War on Secrecy"" that are the basis of ""Fifth Estate"" written by television writer Josh Singer. Condons cast is more than able to propel this character-driven tale. Alicia Vikander plays Bergs no-nonsense girlfriend Anke. Also on hand to pose vital questions is Laura Linney as fictional Undersecretary of State Sarah Shaw. Its Shaws interactions with her Libyan contact Dr. Tarek Haliseh that suggest the unintended yet hardly surprising consequences of unredacted information. Condon directs with a strong sense that tensions between personal torment and mission governmental secrecy and transparency citizen journalism and old-guard media are worth investigating even if they are not easily resolved.

Condon and his screenwriter Josh Singer dont quite know what to make of this duo perhaps because the men didnt quite know what to make of each other either.Most often Assange comes across as a hubristic tantrum-throwing egomaniac whose desire for justice and transparency takes second place to his avidity for celebrity. Its a weirdly inventive performance in a movie that otherwise keeps telling us what to think about the man who unleashed the largest leak of official un-redacted secrets in American history. ""Tyrants of the world should beware"" says a Guardian writer (David Thewlis) about Assange at the end of the film. Would that it were that simple. Grade C (Rated R for language and some violence.)

Photo Frank Connor/AP MOVIE REVIEW The Fifth Estate The second rate. Running time 128 minutes. Rated R (profanity sexuality). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Kips Bay others. Hire ""Dreamgirls"" director Bill Condon to tell the story of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks? Sure and next lets hear from Lady Gaga on the Higgs boson particle. With its combination story of wartime stealth and web stardom ""The Fifth Estate"" tries to be a cross between ""The Social Network"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Only its more like ""The Sociopath Network"" meets ""Zero Dumb Thirty."" As Aussie hacker Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) takes on a German wingman. Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) and builds the WikiLeaks site into the worlds foremost repository for secret materials Condon and his unfocused screenwriter Josh Singer seem baffled by the technical heart of the story. As best Condon can imagine the internet its an OfficeMax commercial about an infinite series of identical desks where dreary clones sit typing. When lines appear on screens they fizz like a mosquito zapper. There are lots of scenes of guys tapping away at keyboards while their glasses and the monitors reflect each other. All is overlaid with a tacky dial-a-thriller musical score of the kind youd expect to hear in a ""Saturday Night Live"" parody of an 80s detective show. Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange in ""The Fifth Estate.""Photo Frank Connor/AP The internet isnt cinematic which is why ""The Social Network"" focused on personality and dialogue. Yet Condon distinguishes himself He manages to make Julian Assange boring. The worlds most wanted/celebrated terrorist/anarchist/freedom fighter/hero comes across as merely a mildly unpleasant drudge. Condon keeps him on the move tirelessly flashing city names -- Nairobi Liege Berlin Antwerp Reykjavik -- on the screen to no effect except to convince us that Assange is well traveled. If youre thinking about opportunities for irony here -- as a result of his exertions Assange has spent the last year and a half in the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he is hiding from authorities -- youre getting far too subtle for Condon. Hes content to have everyone speak in banalities like ""The cats out of the bag"" matched with visual cliches like montages of TV news personalities talking about Assange. The entire movie is a case of a script telling us very obvious Nightly News-level points it ought to instead be showing. Assange was considerably weirder and sinister in the intriguing doc ""We Steal Secrets"" earlier this year. But even though Condon has adapted Domscheit-Bergs whistleblowing book he mostly panders to Assange fans portraying him merely as a bit overzealous in pursuit of freeing information. In reality Assange is far less innocent. Condon also glosses over the (despicable) details of the sexual assault case against Assange. Meanwhile subsidiary figures are reduced to delivering That-Darn- Assange dialogue. Domscheit-Bergs girlfriend is so slight a figure you get the sense Condon was making good on a contractual obligation to include a random female. When she and her man decide to take a roll in the hay (interrupted naturally by Assange) they do so atop an edition of the Guardian newspaper. Here the movie really stretches credulity No one has ever felt sexy within 20 feet of that dreadfully sanctimonious would-be Papal bull from the Vatican of the info wars.

Even his contributions to the ""Twilight"" saga -- the last two-part film -- touched on it. So having him take on a movie about Julian Assange may have seemed like a good thing. But what Condon has delivered is an awkward patched-together work that tries to camouflage its static drama with frenetic camera movements and often abandons character development for obvious sermons. Its not Wiki; its just weak. The problems may have been in the script from the start. For one thing its by a veteran scribe of TVs ""The West Wing"" the home of verbose self-congratulatory wonkiness; for another it takes as its source a memoir by one of Assanges former friends. A former friend who it will surprise no one emerges in this tale as brave and truthful naive but ultimately courageous - The Hero of inconveniently someone elses story. The basic tale is already well known (and already well told in Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"") -- how Assange an iconoclastic loner and brilliant programmer went from hacking government computers to disseminating classified documents. And how he then got hundreds of thousands of top-secret files from an emotionally fragile U.S. private -- and suddenly became the sexy story himself. Its the messier more complicated things that Josh Singers screenplay doesnt quite get (or tries to ignore) from the actual birth of WikiLeaks to the sexual assault charges that have kept Assange in hiding fighting extradition (and are dealt with in a brief title card). Benedict Cumberbatch with his odd masklike face is perfect as the enigmatic Assange -- who goes from pimply outcast to manipulative egoist -- but Singers script isnt comfortable with enigmas. And it too incessantly puts forward Daniel Bruhls Daniel Berg as our hero a position he appears to have claimed chiefly by writing one of the first tell-all books about the leaker. Its far too simple a take on whats a very complicated story. Condon meanwhile seems to realize that the core of his movie -- people sitting looking at laptops reading emails -- is not exactly cinematic. So he goes madly overboard trying to make it visual. When its purely metaphoric -- lines of text filling the screen like a forest of trees or rows of Assanges sitting at identical desks -- it works. But too often its merely melodramatic -- deliriously busy camera movements optical wipes without any purpose. Theres also a reliance on characters we dont know and who seem to be composites at best -- a device wildly out of character with a movie thats all about the unredacted truth. Its just the kind of factual fakery and spoonfed narrative its subject abhorred. Julian Assange is obviously no saint (as Gibneys own documentary showed). But he deserves a little better than this slick docudrama. And so do the very real issues -- about privacy and surveillance journalism and espionage patriotism and treason -- he so messily unearthed. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse and sexual situations. The Fifth Estate (R) (124 min.) Directed by Bill Condon. With Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl.

"The Fifth Estate (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Fifth Estate (R) Film about notorious WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange fails to intrigue. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com10/17/2013 Editor rating 2 The Fifth Estate takes on the important 21st century question of information flow vs. privacy rights and fumbles it into a middling mishmash of techno thriller and future-of-journalism lecture. Directed by Bill Condon (the Breaking Dawn films Dreamgirls Kinsey) the movie is based on books about activist and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange the polarizing figure who became famous by posting secret documents from whistleblowers on his website. Both were written by former collaborators so The Fifth Estate comes with a less than generous view of Assange. Through the eyes of his protege and eventual partner computer programmer Daniel (played by Daniel Bruhl of Rush and Inglourious Basterds) Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a devoted champion of the underdog whose feet of clay swiftly crumble once his gargantuan ego is challenged. The Fifth Estate -- if youre not familiar with the reference fear not; one of the newspaper editors in the film will explain it eventually -- focuses on the relationship between the two men with the mysterious Assange as a sort of Svengali who seduces Daniel with promises that they can change the world even if they have only one server. Daniel is enthralled by the charismatic Australian (who may suffer from some form of schizophrenia the movie hints) and he neglects his job and personal life to throw himself into the task of toppling corrupt banks and greedy politicians. But their partnership is threatened when they clash over a leak of classified documents on the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Assange is not interested in redacting names of government sources; Daniel and the Guardian editor who wants to co-publish the story (David Thewlis) say publishing the names will get people killed all over the world. Assange wont budge To him editing equals bias. The movie provides a good showcase for British star Cumberbatch and Bruhl both of whom deliver good performances but overall it turns out to be more of an elementary primer on WikiLeaks than anything else. Taking on the story of Assange in a visual medium was always going to be a problem Computer code IMs emails and people banging away on keyboards does not translate well to film no matter how many bells and whistles you slap on it. Condon slaps on quite a few some more effective than others; The Fifth Estate is that rare film with a ""Lets Set Up More Servers"" musical montage. Theres also a repeated visual metaphor that falters more every time Condon returns to it. The film lacks focus; with such an intriguing story at hand the sideplot of Daniel being too obsessed with his new calling to pay attention to his girlfriend (Alicia Vikander of Anna Karenina) feels superfluous and could have been omitted. Nor does the film explore the sexual assault allegations against Assange or the fact that hes now biding time at the Ecuadorean embassy in London (he has been granted diplomatic immunity there) dealing with those parts of the story via end credits. Whatever you think of him -- hero or traitor or something in between? -- Assange is a compelling figure that merited a better effort.

Escape Plan fits snugly into history of prison movies Julian Assange weighed in on The Fifth Estate without seeing it dismissing the new WikiLeaks drama as malicious propaganda. I dont have a dog in that hunt. I just dont think its a very good movie.The first narrative film portrait of the white-blond cyber bad boy feels undercooked and overwrought haphazardly written and overdirected. By the time it picks up steam down the stretch as Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) flexes his muscle and burns his bridges Estate has turned into a visual cliche with a muddled story.For those who forgot to pay their Internet bill Assange is the Australian-born activist-journalist behind WikiLeaks. In releasing thousands of pages of secret documents and collaborating with The New York Times The Guardian and Der Spiegel to publish reams of edited diplomatic cables WikiLeaks and its never-repentant founder became the symbol for a tumultuous age of free-flowing digital information.Cumberbatchs Assange is a haughty deep-voiced hustler imbued with online wizardry and missionary zeal a couch surfer consumed by megalomania. Hes onto something new and big and director Bill Condon strains to show that newness and bigness at every turn.Text litters the screen at one point traveling horizontally along an airports movable sidewalk. To illustrate Assanges audacity of autonomous power Condon continually shows a vast computer-generated office peopled by dozens of Cumberbatches mischievously tapping away at computers. The conceit would be clever once around. As a motif it repeats like the worlds most heavy-handed online GIF.The Fifth Estate is based on two different books which may explain why it doesnt seem sure what story it wants to tell. One of the authors is Assanges former colleague Daniel Domscheit-Berg played as a practical idealist by rising star Daniel Bruhl (Rush). He is to The Fifth Estate what Andrew Garfields Eduardo Saverin was to The Social Network the conscientious accomplice who blanches when the Big Ego in Charge runs off the rails.But The Fifth Estate also wants to tell a larger-scale tale of journalisms impact on geopolitics. This story line is compelling but underserved by the screen time allotted here. Laura Linney always a treat plays a flinty diplomat trying to look out for a source exposed and endangered by the released documents.David Thewlis is also excellent as The Guardians Nick Davies who seeks out Assange and helps form an uneasy alliance between old media and new. These sequences are fraught with intrigue but they get obscured by the movies clutter.""I believe you are a good person"" Assange wrote Cumberbatch in turning down the actors request for an interview ""but I do not believe that this film is a good film.""I believe theres a great WikiLeaks movie to be made.

Grade B ""The Fifth Estate"" a fictionalized rendering of the rise of WikiLeaks offers a prime example of what a dramatic feature offers that even a documentary as fine as ""We Steal Secrets The Story of WikiLeaks"" cannot. Benedict Cumberbatch restores mystery to the personality of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and fascination to his role as a global crusader for free speech. Ultimately Assange comes off as too careless self-centered and personally secretive to lead a movement that depends on cooperation and transparency. But Cumberbatch freshens up his hyperbolic eloquence. He conjures the magnetic effect Assange could have on people around him. The star of the BBCs terrific ""Sherlock"" series as well as ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" Cumberbatch imbues Assange with a startling otherworldly charisma. He makes audiences as well as his followers believe that protecting the identities of whistleblowers and disseminating their documents on the Internet will skewer corrupt nations and businesses and empower citizens around the world. He flamboyantly conveys how a slippery personality can seize a bold idea and enlist more conventional responsible people in his cause. Despite Assanges highly publicized bellyaching over the script Cumberbatch makes him seem more attractive than he is in the press conferences and cinema verite of ""We Steal Secrets."" Hes a one-man risky business but hes a spellbinder too whether in a lecture hall or a computer geeks cluttered apartment. The movie is mostly the story of how Assange and a crucial recruit steady idealistic IT expert Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) formed WikiLeaks dysfunctional core. Yet they still managed to engineer in 2010 the biggest leak of classified materials in history - U.S. Army Pfc. Bradley (now Chelsea) Mannings trove of documents about the Iraq and Afghan wars and his database of State Department emails. The thrill is supposed to come from the films intimate rendering of the internal dissension in WikiLeaks widely reported in the press when Assange was accused of sexual assault in Sweden. (Hes still living in the sanctuary of the Ecuadorian embassy in London to evade a European Arrest Warrant for questioning.) The suspense and intrigue are meant to stem from our wondering whether Assange and Berg can hold their partnership and WikiLeaks together. Yet the moviemakers cant use this pair to focus everything they want to say about the acceleration of the information revolution the need to create online whistleblowers havens and the perils of posting unedited documents that could endanger innocent individuals working in war zones or under repressive regimes. In ""The Fifth Estate"" Berg the audiences sane surrogate in the action provides the common-sense grounding and detail-work WikiLeaks needs to get up and running. Bruhls Berg is a rapt accomplice whose devotion verges on hero worship. He becomes disillusioned after witnessing Assanges reckless manipulations of individuals and organizations and his cruel behavior to people as important to Berg as his parents and his lover Anke Domscheit (Alicia Vikander in a nothing role). The comparison to ""The Social Network"" is inevitable. But ""The Fifth Estate"" lacks that films crackling wit lucidity and intensity. Director Bill Condon and screenwriter Josh Singer attempt too many things at once. The opening credits alone take us from cave paintings and fireside storytelling to the publication of Bradley Mannings war logs. Then the movie flashes back - an over-familiar device and one that doesnt serve this hectic narrative. WikiLeaks early string of exposes is amazing Kenyan human rights violations Scandinavian bank frauds Peruvian oil scandals the ""secret bibles"" of Scientology. The film uses them mostly to emphasize the antiheros peripatetic lifestyle and WikiLeaks burgeoning reputation. This movie catapults audiences into the virtual mind-set of Assange both dramatically and visually. The action repeatedly depicts Assange as a man who doesnt acknowledge normal physical events like ""day"" and ""night"" as he lunges around Kenya Germany Iceland and England. The movie uses one version of his troubled hazy roustabout childhood to explain his rambling elusiveness as an adult. But the film is most successful when Condon draws you into Bergs perception of Assanges Internet reality as a universe within the universe peopled by shadowy lieutenants who exist only as pseudonyms for Assange. But the jacked-up editing hyper pace and eclectic visual style prove to be more exhausting than expressive. As if this story werent complicated enough Condon and Singer develop a whole other plotline featuring Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci as members of the U.S. State Department. WikiLeaks release of Mannings State Department database puts her best Libyan source and oldest friend at mortal risk. Its admirable to indicate that the State Department worked quickly to ensure no one would come to harm. But the action is tacked on and clunky. And not even Linney can rise above lines like ""Remember that New Years Eve party in Sharm al Sheilk?"" (She does have one hilarious bit reading an embarrassing email.) Still when all else fails the movie boasts the excitement of seeing Cumberbatch embody Assange as a will o the wisp with an iron will - a perfect spokesman for the idea that controversial thoughts and information can streak through the Web and maintain or increase their powers of provocation. He holds men and women in his thrall without revealing anything about himself. His instincts are more abstract than human yet Cumberbatch imbues him with slyness and alertness. With a knack for keeping one step ahead of his attackers and his followers hes a perpetually moving target. With close associates hes a soul-teaser -- he keeps persuading people that he has one and that someday theyll see it. A shot of Assange dancing in ""We Steal Secrets"" makes him look creepy and alone lost in some private vapor. When director Condon expands on that shot in ""The Fifth Estate"" Assange undulates in a way that takes in the entire dance floor - like an octopus as one character puts it. Cumberbatch as Assange brings the film a coiling fascination that keeps it humming even when it collapses under the weight of its own ambition.

"The Fifth Estates portrayal of Julian Assange already seems dated review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Fifth Estates portrayal of Julian Assange already seems dated reviewBenedict Cumberbatch stars as digital muckraker Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate. Benedict Cumberbatch gives a sterling portayal of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in The Fifth Estate.  (Dreamworks pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 17 2013The Fifth EstateStarring Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl Anthony Mackie David Thewlis Stanley Tucci Laura Linney and Alicia Vikander. Directed by Bill Condon. Opens Oct. 18 at GTA theatres. 128 minutes. 14AWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange damns The Fifth Estate as a ""geriatric snoozefest"" saying the film falsely portrays him and his whistle-blowing online organization.His keen interest is understandable. Since 2010 the Aussie muckraker has morphed from obscure web activist into international firebrand one worthy of portrayal by in-demand actor Benedict Cumberbatch. (Assange is also in demand by legal and government authorities. Hence his current status as asylum seeker living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.)Article Continued BelowSubjects of a film rarely make the best judges of them and Assange is no exception. The ""geriatric"" part of his slag is simply silly (hes 42 Cumberbatch is 37) and as for the ""snoozefest"" bit its entirely the opposite problem for The Fifth Estate the gala opener of this years TIFF.Too much info is hurled at the screen much of it at a rapid clip that makes it hard to take in. Director Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) and screenwriter Josh Singer (TVs The West Wing) adopt the info-dump approach of WikiLeaks combining elements of biopic thriller and didactic documentary for a story that engages the mind but sometimes slogs.At the heart of it is Cumberbatchs sterling portrayal of Assange a man who takes the ""publish and be damned"" ethos to 21st-century heights shaking world governments with revealed secrets and lies just a few clicks away.The performance may not be to Assanges liking. But it seems true to his public image as a man who although not short of intellect ambition or ideals otherwise lacks social graces and quite possibly a conscience.Together with his geeky German tech adviser Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Rush revelation Daniel Bruhl) first seen in a 2007 flashback Assange shocks world governments in 2010 by allying with newspapers the New York Times the Guardian and Der Spiegel to fully leak online (and partially in print) nearly 400000 confidential U.S. government documents.Many of the documents concern the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. WikiLeaks exposes intemperate remarks by U.S. and other government officials that often vary from the public record such as civilian death tolls higher than previously reported.Assange is declared a hero in some quarters and a traitor in others since the leaks also risk exposing the identities of undercover agents worldwide. His arrogance rising along with his notoriety he rejoins that its neither his desire nor responsibility to edit the material covertly obtained by WikiLeaks. The practical ethical and legal implications of Assanges attitudes and behaviour are duly covered by The Fifth Estate as is the inevitable old press versus new media tussle over the responsibilities and challenges of the digital era. A sturdy supporting cast that includes David Thewlis Stanley Tucci Laura Linney Anthony Mackie and Alicia Vikander brings flesh and blood to the proceedings if not always warmth and light.Theres one very curious thing about The Fifth Estate however. As much it claims urgency with current events and issues it seems out of date even coming just three years after the real events. Maybe Assange is on to something after all with his ""geriatric snoozefest"" slag.Assange has now largely vanished from the news replaced by stories about Edward Snowden the former National Security Agency official who this year exposed the U.S. governments dirty secrets about widespread wiretapping. Snowden is also on the run perhaps waiting for his own Hollywood close-up -- and wouldnt Daniel Radcliffe be a dandy casting pick?The Fifth Estate unintentionally makes for an object lesson about short attention spans something long known by journalists todays headlines are tomorrows fish wrap.Read more about Julian Assange WikileaksThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Bruhl. Directed by Bill Condon. (R. 128 minutes.) Its probably too early to make a movie about Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and ""The Fifth Estate"" reflects this. Based on a book by Daniel Berg who was an Assange associate the movie cant quite decide what it thinks of him - or even if it should decide at all. The filmmakers take for granted that Assange is something of a creep at least as a person but consider it an open question whether Assange is an inspired visionary creep or a regular one. And as for whether WikiLeaks has done more good or harm the filmmakers dont really know. This ambivalence of viewpoint - not complexity but flat-out ambivalence - is indicated by three separate scenes near the finish in which various characters discuss the impact and historical implications of what Assange did. A range of opinions is expressed and all of them sound valid. They probably all sounded good to the filmmakers too. The problem here isnt that the movie doesnt tell us what to think but that the people behind the movie dont seem to know what to think either. Yet heres the thing In a few decades when time sorts out the effects of WikiLeaks and other Internet sites like it the very ambivalence of ""The Fifth Estate"" might very well be seen as a virtue as a document of an another eras honest confusion. But today on a Friday in October in 2013 the movies uncertainty doesnt help. It puts the audience in the position of having to sort through an unsifted pile of information as though dealing with a document dump. ""The Fifth Estate"" attempts to cover a lot. We get the story of the organization - for a lot of the way it was just Assange and Berg - as they pursued Assanges idea of exposing the secrets of governments and powerful organizations while keeping the identities of whistle-blowers secret. Perhaps any one of the WikiLeaks stories was complex enough to form an entire movie. Getting these stories in shorthand means that the viewer is often in the position of not quite knowing whats going on or even whats being exposed. Its almost as if the screenwriters assume weve all just read a book about Assange before walking into the theater. The movies style is as cold as its subject. Graphics pop up on the screen to tell us what European city the characters happen to be in and the camera hovers and moves around them as if getting slightly nervous. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Assange as an odd person incapable of warmth or genuine connection randomly rude and without the impulse of kindness. We see him mainly through the eyes of Berg (Daniel Bruhl) who finds him a charismatic figure which we also recognize. Cumberbatch embodies the magnetism of someone possessed by an idea. ""The Fifth Estate"" becomes more focused in its last hour when it concentrates on the Bradley Manning leak of tens of thousands of U.S. diplomatic documents. It shows how WikiLeaks worked with print publications in three countries to release these pages and how Assange became increasingly untrustworthy and cavalier about revealing the identities of informants whose lives as a result were placed in danger. Laura Linney plays a mid-level career diplomat whose confidential e-mails are exposed. To watch ""The Fifth Estate"" is to share the filmmakers ambivalent feelings. No one wants to live under a monolithic government that can do anything to anybody and never be exposed - or that protects wrongdoers under the false cover of national security. At the same time you cant have honest communication within a government - you cant really conduct business - if you have to worry that at any moment some 22-year-old private is going to publish all your e-mails and memos on the Internet. Only people who find comfort in extreme positions would be happy to put up with either situation. ""The Fifth Estate"" raises these issues which are interesting and so the movie is reasonably interesting as well. Not entirely successful or appealing - not exactly a delightful evening in the company of scintillating characters - but interesting all the same.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT October 17 2013The film focuses on the work of underground watchdogs of the privileged and powerful but it feels patchy and only partially informative.Benedict Cumberbatch left and Daniel Bruhl star in The Fifth Estate.(Photo Frank Connor DreamWorks Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl Carice van HoutenRated R; Runtime 2 hours 8 minutes; opens Friday nationwideThe Fifth Estate doesnt seem to be presenting the full story.Instead its a fairly dull thriller (1/2 stars out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) about a hugely influential Internet phenomenon.Aiming for The Social Network territory with a dash of All the Presidents Men it veers between an unflattering biopic of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and a partial treatise on how traditional media is lagging behind new models of newsgathering.The films title refers to the watchdogs who attempt to monitor the government wealthy elite workers and the mainstream press.The story focuses on the formation and ascendancy of WikiLeaks a website that encourages and protects whistle-blowers who leak damning information. The climax of the film centers on the public release in 2010 of hundreds of classified U.S. intelligence documents about the Iraq War -- the biggest such trove in history.STORY Cumberbatch expands his Estate as WikiLeaks founderMORE Assange and Cumberbatch A tale of two lettersREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWas this a legitimate way to expose high-level corruption and deceptive practices or a move that endangered innocent people? To their credit the filmmakers pose but dont attempt to answer that key question. Yet the road taken to tell this important story is uneven.Benedict Cumberbatch is first-rate as the high-handed pale-haired Australian Assange. Hes mesmerizing and easily the films best asset. Daniel Bruhl is convincing as Daniel Domscheit-Berg a colleague who grows disillusioned as Assange seems increasingly determined to gain power.For all its topicality the film fails to rustle up suspense. Scenes of computer screens lit up with indecipherable code are hardly riveting. And the filmmakers efforts at artier surreal visuals are more jarring than illuminating. Director Bill Condon fails to blend these elements with the human drama or the thriller aspects of the story.The paradox at the heart of the film is that Assange is hell-bent on exposing corporate malfeasance and rails about transparency yet hes unnaturally secretive about his own history and the way in which WikiLeaks actually functions.Assange is portrayed as paranoid controlling vain and petty. He makes a big deal out of having been raised in a cult as a child and disciplined harshly within it. But those working closely with him realize that much of his world is built on lies.Via WikiLeaks Assange is said to have exposed more corporate crimes and government secrets than mainstream news organizations. But he and Domscheit-Berg clash over ethics in the handling of the U.S. intelligence data.The film sheds some light on the contradictions between Assanges ideology and his methodology but it feels incomplete.The film is based on Domscheit-Bergs book Inside WikiLeaks and most of what transpires is told from his perspective. Not surprisingly Domscheit-Berg is portrayed as reasonable and idealistic unfairly pushed out of the organization after a falling-out with the increasingly egomaniacal Assange. But whose truth are we seeing?Ironically for a movie about the importance of accuracy and transparency its hard to know what is actually factual in this cinematic account. 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1aSO4n9Fall Movies Calendar OctoberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this October.

October 17 2013 -- 325pm Frank Connor  DreamWorks Pictures Benedict Cumberbatch portrays WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in ""The Fifth Estate."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert When a democratically elected government erects walls of secrecy around its operations is breaching those ramparts espionage or higher patriotism? When spy agencies have unprecedented surveillance power should activists hold those institutions to account? Who should judge whether classified leaks are too sensitive to report? Is Julian Assange the James Bond of digital journalism or an ego-mad Bond supervillain? ""The Fifth Estate"" wrestles with such messy imprecise moral complexities as it dramatizes the rise and ostracism of WikiLeaks founder Assange. Director Bill Condon (of ""Kinsey"" ""Dreamgirls"" and the ""Twilight"" series) shows admirable ambition in tackling such a slippery character. Its an intellectual grappling match that leaves viewers feeling worked over disoriented and not much the wiser. Screenwriter Josh Singer (""The West Wing"") has no idea what hacker extraordinaire Assanges political legacy will be. What he delivered is neither a political suspense film nor an international fugitive chase nor a penetrating character study. Like ""The Social Network"" and ""Jobs"" before it ""The Fifth Estates"" takeaway message is that the geek demigods shaping our future are driven cerebral and total jerks. The film unfolds in the two years before Assange published classified U.S. military cables about the war in Afghanistan. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the platinum-haired hacker extraordinaire as a bipolar enigma. In one scene he seems principled and justifiably defensive under attack from his many powerful enemies. In the next hes demagogic imperious and erratic turning against onetime friend Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) a German WikiLeaks collaborator. Domscheit-Berg is presented as the wise ethically astute Jiminy Cricket on Assanges shoulder. His memoir ""Inside WikiLeaks My Time With Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website"" served as the films backbone which may explain why he appears so gallant. In an effort to give the film a breaking-news zip Condon revs every scene with manic energy. The opening montage takes us from the development of cuneiform writing through telegraphy TV and the Internet in a rocket-sled blur. There are speed-blurred references to WikiLeaks early exposes uncovering the dirty laundry of big businesses and governments around the world. Its a thrill to see news footage of the bent bankers behind Icelands financial meltdown doing the perp walk. THE FIFTH ESTATE 1/2 out of 4 stars Rated R for language and some violence. But Condon wants us to be dazzled by clumps of binary data and online chats whipping across the screen. His boldest scenes laughably imagine WikiLeaks cloud-based workplace as a ""Matrix""-like virtual office open to the skies with infinite desks receding to the vanishing point. Still you sympathize. Its not easy to give spy-movie urgency to a film where a big action scene is a guy whipping a laptop out of his backpack. Locations skip from Berlin to London to Reykjavik and whenever a scene can be set in a techno-beat disco with whirly lights it is. Dialogue is declaimed not spoken. As English reporter Nick Davies who uncovered the Murdoch phone-hacking scandal David Thewlis has mouthfuls of argle-bargle about print journalisms sacred responsibility to protect sources check stories and not put lives in danger. Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci play a couple of State Department diplomats who furrow their brows at Assanges tell-all agenda. The subtext is ""Stay alert this is really important"" but the film is so unwieldy that details blur. ""The Fifth Estate"" is a cyberthriller without thrills. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Fox Searchlight By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Oct. 17 2013 111 p.m. ET Movie audiences have never been presented with anything quite like the intertwined beauty and savagery of ""12 Years a Slave"" so its anyones guess whether theyll extend the embrace that Steve McQueens film deserves. Such is the power of this landmark event though that it seems certain to transcend the movie realm and become a new reference point in contemporary culture--a defining vision of what slavery looked like and felt like in the U.S. before the Civil War. Its a sun-scorched vision of hell that puts Hieronymus Bosch in the shade. At the same time--and heres the genius of the production and of John Ridleys script--its a thrilling tale of survival based on a celebrated 1853 memoir by Solomon Northup. A free black man living happily and prosperously with his wife and children in Saratoga N.Y. Solomon (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is pulled into a nightmare world when he is abducted by bounty hunters in 1841 then shipped off to a plantation in Louisiana as a slave in shackles and chains. Movie audiences have never seen anything like the intertwined beauty and savagery of ""12 Years a Slave"" which could make or break the movie. WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern offers his take. Photo Fox Searchlight. At first the educated sweet-spirited victim doesnt realize whats happening to him but hes brought all too quickly to understand the ruthlessness of slave traders who treat the men women and children they sell as talking livestock--""My sentimentality"" says a pitiless trader played by Paul Giamatti ""extends the length of a coin""--and the inhumanity of plantation owners who buy them. ""There is no sin"" says one owner Edwin Epps a lust-addled Scripture-quoting brute played by Michael Fassbender. ""A man does how he pleases with his property."" Like its source material ""12 Years a Slave"" is a polemic and a furious one. How could it not be given the physical horror and moral squalor of the society it explores? Solomons agonies--the lashings the capricious beatings--are barely endurable for him and a test of our willingness to bear witness even though its hard to turn away from the astonishing range and impassioned conviction of Mr. Ejiofors portrayal. A slave named Patsey (Lupita Nyongo in another of the films brilliant performances) endures even more terrible punishment at the hands of Epps whose tortured sexuality leads him to rape her ritually and to have her whipped until the flesh falls from her back. The polemic is also a work of art. Mr. McQueen was a visual artist before he became a filmmaker and he and his cinematographer Sean Bobbitt give us a succession of images that seem discovered rather than devised. (In one extended excruciating sequence that Ill describe obliquely so as not to diminish its impact Solomon touches his toes to a patch of mud like a dancer performing a life-or-death gavotte.) The artistry extends to the heightened almost literary language spoken by the slaves among themselves and occasionally to their masters; its a choice that could have fallen into affectation but serves to honor inchoate feelings that might otherwise have gone unexpressed. Yet Mr. Ridleys exemplary script gives everyone his intricate due. The white men and women who inhabit the film arent all undifferentiated monsters--one can imagine them being tender with their children and generous to their friends--and those of them who perpetrate the most flagrant evil are anything but banal. Mr. Fassbender shines however malignantly as the worst villain of the bunch. Epps is the lethally serious counterpart of the jovial monster played by Christoph Waltz in ""Django Unchained"" and one more reminder that villainy in drama is its own reward. Benedict Cumberbatch is Ford a plantation owner with a paternalistic bent; he recognizes Solomons intellectual and musical gifts and treats him reasonably well but still sees him as a valuable piece of property. Paul Danos overseer Tibeats is terrifying for his invincible stupidity. Watch a clip from the film ""12 Years a Slave."" Actor Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon Northup a free black man from upstate New York in the antebellum United States who is abducted and sold into slavery. (Photo/Video Fox Searchlight Pictures) As an emblem of plantation societys contradictions Alfre Woodards Mistress Shaw is serenely almost surreally charming; a black woman and former slave she is married to a white plantation owner. Brad Pitts Bass is the antithesis of evil a Canadian abolitionist who may be the least convincing character in the film because he shows up out of nowhere and delivers the scripts only lapse into didacticism. Thats easy to forgive on three counts though Mr. Pitt is perfectly fine in the role; as one of the producers he was instrumental in getting ""12 Years a Slave"" to the screen; and the abolitionists message of equality is a worthy one. ""Your story is amazing"" Bass tells Solomon gravely ""and in no way good."" The film is amazing and in every way good. All Is Lost This is one of those films you either buy into right away or dismiss as a stunt. I bought in--much to my surprise since it promised to be a stunt--and far from feeling any remorse I grew more invested as the going got rough. Watch a clip from the J.C. Chandor film ""All Is Lost."" After a collision with a shipping container at sea a resourceful sailor (Robert Redford) finds himself staring his mortality in the face. (Photo Daniel Daza Video Roadside Attractions) The going gets exceedingly rough in J.C. Chandors existential thriller with Robert Redford as a solo sailor struggling to survive in the vastness of the Indian Ocean after his yacht collides with an errant shipping container. Thats the cast thats the plot No back story for the unnamed yachtsman; no dialogue apart from a brief and affecting preface plus a very few words en route; no tiger no mystical or religious subtext. The only thing we know the sailor believes in is celestial navigation which he uses after the failure of his boats electronics in an effort to maneuver into shipping lanes where he stands a chance of being rescued. ENLARGE Robert Redford in All Is Lost Roadside Attractions What engaged my interest at first was the staging of the collision no setup no drama just a bang in the night and a gouge in the fiberglass hull that presages disaster. But ""All Is Lost"" amps up as its heros options dwindle. Its a meditation on mortality with remarkable resemblances to ""Gravity"" not to mention echoes of ""The Old Man and the Sea."" Its admirably crafted with a wealth of detail that illustrates the sailors resourcefulness. (Credit for the cinematography is shared by Frank G. DeMarco who worked above the water line and Peter Zuccarini who shot the underwater sequences.) ""All Is Lost"" is also a showcase for an understated yet mesmerizing performance. You cant help seeing Mr. Redford as the star he has been over so many decades. At the very same time though you see him as the sailor suddenly vulnerable yet ferociously determined to live. The actor has become vulnerable too. At 77 he looks more or less his age. He has the rugged face of someone who has spent too much time in the sun. His golden hair has lost its backlighted glow. Yet Mr. Redford gives his character a formidable physicality. He is said to have done almost all his own stunts and clearly enhanced his performance in the process. As bruised and battered as the sailor becomes he is youthened by the struggle hes unlikely to win. Its all strangely but genuinely stirring. The Fifth Estate ENLARGE Daniel Bruhl left and Benedict Cumberbatch DreamWorks Benedict Cumberbatch is Julian Assange the WikiLeaks founder in a tale of the digital age that scores a dubious analog triumph. Mr. Cumberbatch brings an intriguingly creepy ambiguity to the role but the style of the film directed by Bill Condon is analogous to its subject torrents of inscrutable info about a man whose self-appointed mission has been distributing torrents of hitherto-secret data. Watch a clip from the film ""The Fifth Estate"" based on real events that reveals the quest to expose deceptions and corruptions of power that turned an internet upstart into the centurys most fiercely debated organization. (Photo/Video Dreamworks) The title refers to an emerging paradigm that differs from that of the traditional Fourth Estate. Now a single person with a computer and Internet access can be his or her own editor-publisher on a global scale. Mr. Assange is a prominent exemplar of this new journalism or whatever one chooses to call it and of its perils; an Australian citizen hes currently holed up in London in the Ecuadorian Embassy which has granted him political asylum. But Josh Singers diffuse script based on one book by Daniel Domscheit-Berg and another book by David Leigh and Luke Harding chooses to avoid any judgment of its heros conduct and omits any political or ethical context in which he might be placed. Instead ""The Fifth Estate"" gives us an obsessive-compulsive messiah with a taste for martyrdom and full-screen cascades of computer code in place of a coherent plot. Exhausting in a new way the movie is a data dump devoid of drama. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Dirty Pretty Things (2002) Chiwetel Ejiofor is Okwe an African immigrant working nights as a London hotel desk clerk while hiding from the immigration police. Audrey Tautous Senay a Muslim beauty from Turkey is an immigrant in hiding too. A maid at the hotel she dreams of living in New York. The movie directed by Stephen Frears was conceived as a thriller; the plot turns on illegal passports. Its beauty though lies in its stark portrayal of the nightmare despair of aliens hunted on edge and prepared to risk all for a new start. ENLARGE Margin Call(2011) J.C. Chandors impressive debut feature takes place in 2008 in the Manhattan headquarters of an investment bank that bears a more-than-passing resemblance to Lehman Brothers. The story is set in motion when a young risk analyst who used to work as a rocket scientist spots a piece of data on his computer screen reflects briefly on what hes discovered then realizes that its the financial equivalent of the asteroid headed for Earth in ""Armageddon."" The ensemble cast includes Jeremy Irons Kevin Spacey Stanley Tucci Paul Bettany and Demi Moore. ENLARGE Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy(2011) Benedict Cumberbatch who is in two of this weeks releases is one of many distinguished actors in the supporting cast of this quietly remarkable production a feature version of the classic 1979 BBC miniseries.

Frank Connor/DreamWorks II The Fifth Estate Director Bill Condon Genre Drama Running Time 128 minutes Rated Rated R for language and some violence With Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl Laura Linney The saga of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks is too large a data dump for a two-hour drama. Yet director Bill Condon seeks to complicate as well as simplify in The Fifth Estate an entertaining if inevitably unreliable current events romp. The opening credits present a pocket history of textual communication from cuneiform to the Internet. Condon who took a similarly breathless approach with Kinsey is announcing that his subject is nothing less than how the Web transformed communication. That is indeed one thread of Josh Singers script derived from two books on Assange and his organization. But the movies spine is the relationship between the white-haired Australian (eerily embodied by Benedict Cumberbatch) and the author of one of those tomes Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl). The two meet at a 2007 hacker convention in Berlin and Domscheit-Berg (under the alias Schmitt) quickly becomes WikiLeaks chief lieutenant. Even he doesnt know that at first because the self-dramatizing Assange claims to have many associates. But they like much of the operation are fiction. Assange At The Movies Movie Reviews We Steal Secrets A Sidelong Look At WikiLeaks Documentary Introduces The Man Behind WikiLeaks Listen  747 747 Toggle more options Download Embed Embed Transcript Intent on the titles conceit that the Web has supplanted traditional journalisms role as the ""fourth estate"" of civil society Condon periodically presents WikiLeaks as a newsroom sometimes busy and sometimes nearly deserted. When Berg realizes hes been electronically conversing with several pseudonyms for Assange the place fills with multiples of a lank-haired long-faced Cumberbatch. WikiLeaks in style if not in substance is The Matrix. Angry at being deceived Berg nonetheless remains with Assange and even recruits a friend and fellow computer savant (Moritz Bleibtreu). They and a few others expose political murders in Kenya Scientologys esoteric doctrines banking scandals in Iceland and Switzerland. In 2010 comes the classified U.S. information about military activities in Afghanistan not to mention a quarter million State Department cables. These massive releases bring WikiLeaks into a fraught alliance with three newspapers personified on-screen principally by David Thewlis as a reporter for the U.K.-based Guardian. It also rattles the Obama administration as embodied in composite characters played by Anthony Mackie Stanley Tucci and Laura Linney. i The films core narrative is driven by the intense relationship between Assange and Domscheit-Berg but it also ventures into a subplot involving U.S. officials (Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci) dealing with the consequences of WikiLeaks disruptive data dumps. Frank Connor/DreamWorks II hide caption toggle caption Frank Connor/DreamWorks II The films core narrative is driven by the intense relationship between Assange and Domscheit-Berg but it also ventures into a subplot involving U.S. officials (Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci) dealing with the consequences of WikiLeaks disruptive data dumps. Frank Connor/DreamWorks II In a subplot that attempts to illustrate the real-world effects of WikiLeaks failure to redact documents Linneys veteran diplomat hurries to extract from Libya a no-longer-confidential source (Alexander Siddig). But Cumberbatchs portrayal of a mercurial megalomaniacal Assange conveys recklessness more pungently than this cinematic side trip to Libya. Like most films that attempt to visualize the Internets 0s and 1s The Fifth Estate flashes letters and numbers on the screen sometimes lashing them with simulated glitches. But the movie doesnt just strive to convey the speed of digital communication. It also sends its principal characters hopping from city to city continent to continent restlessly on the move. (One sign that this is a Hollywood product Nobody gets stuck on the tarmac or even has to wait for a taxi.) The movie sketches its version of Assanges back story with rough strokes several childhood years spent in an Australian cult a teenage hacking adventure that took him into NASA computers and almost to jail. To comprehend this history lesson it would help to read up in advance or at least watch We Steal Secrets Alex Gibneys Assange documentary. Condon himself shifts to the documentary format at the end offering quick notes on Assanges current situation -- including the only mention of sexual assault allegations leveled against him -- and short clips from an interview. In one of these the Wiki man denounces the movie he expects Condon to make. It might seem gracious of the director to let Assange end the film by damning it. But as The Fifth Estate excitedly illustrates in the Internet age no one can ever really have the last word.

The script by Josh Singer is built blatantly on the bones of ""The Social Network""; director Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls"" the last two ""Twilight"" movies) tries to dramatize the storys ideas but instead turns them into simplistic Power Point bullets that just lie there. Well made and watchable the movie is itself the response of an entrenched information system toward something it barely comprehends.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Guardian journalist Ian Katz (Dan Stevens) left works with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in ""The Fifth Estate."" (Frank Connor) By Ann Hornaday October 17 2013 Follow AnnHornaday As part of an exceptionally strong season of fact-based dramas on screen ""The Fifth Estate"" about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange arrives with something of a shrug. At its best the film works as a serious showcase for its capable star the British actor Benedict Cumberbatch who delivers an eerily on-point portrayal of the enigmatic central character. And as a primer on the early days of WikiLeaks and its crusade for transparency and governmental and corporate accountability ""The Fifth Estate"" provides useful reminders to audiences who may have come to equate the organization with Assanges own overweening ego and strange persona. But as a piece of filmed entertainment ""The Fifth Estate"" shows why things like authorial point of view and visual sensibility are so essential in bringing such stories to life. Unlike its most obvious predecessor ""The Social Network"" this film doesnt have much of either and the weakness shows. Based on books by former Assange collaborators Daniel Domscheit-Berg David Leigh and Luke Harding ""The Fifth Estate"" focuses on Assanges relationship with Domscheit-Berg (played in the film by ""Rush"" star Daniel Bruhl) a computer programmer in Germany who meets the snow-haired Australian at a hackers conference and quickly warms to his calls for ""a whole new form of social justice"" by way of using encryption to protect whistleblowers. Domscheit-Berg throws in with Assange who has created WikiLeaks in the belief that ""if you give a man a mask hell tell you the truth."" And for a while it works In bracing sequences ""The Fifth Estate"" shows Assange and Domscheit-Berg exposing powerful banks corrupt regimes and fraudulent elections driven by their righteous sober-minded belief in freedom of expression and unfettered access to raw information. The dream begins to sour with WikiLeaks most high-profile ""gets"" the release of footage of U.S. forces killing two Reuters reporters in Iraq and a subsequent leak of sensitive State Department cables. Working with newspapers in Germany London and the United States Assange refuses to redact material that might have led to the death of intelligence assets. Regardless of its on-the-one-hand-on-the-other approach ""The Fifth Estate"" clearly suggests Assange has blood on his hands. Whether thats the cost of a far higher aim or a sign of Assanges moral arrogance is the crux of the debate that the film seeks to engage but never fully animates. Director Bill Condon working from a script by Josh Singer tries to hype the story by way of awkward scenes of State Department officials (Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci) a gratuitous subplot involving Domscheit-Bergs love life and a visual trope involving an empty office that winds up being clumsy and intrusive just when ""The Fifth Estate"" should be taut and keenly focused. (For a terrific documentary account of Assanges career see Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets The Story of WikiLeaks"" released earlier this year.) As with ""The Social Network"" the challenge of ""The Fifth Estate"" is to inject visual interest in a story thats essentially a bunch of guys looking at computer screens -- a challenge that Condon wrestles with uneven success. Whats more he seems fatally unsure of what he himself believes about Assange who at one point observes that the media are far more interested in how weird he is rather than the substance of his revelations. Ultimately ""The Fifth Estate"" seems guilty of the same charge as the movie speculates on his own shifting autobiography and whether he dyes his hair. Assange may be right he may be wrong -- he may be a bit of both. Whatever is true he deserves a sharper more consequential movie.   R. At area theaters.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of Julian Assange and the founding of WikiLeaks. Rated R.

CAST Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl LENGTH 208 And the award for Best Actor in a Disappointing Movie goes to... Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange in ""The Fifth Estate."" Cumberbatch also arriving on screens today in a smaller role in the must-see ""12 Years a Slave"" captures the Assange we recognize from the news the enigmatic WikiLeaks founder with the dead-white hair and constrastingly passionate dedication to exposing the secrets of the powerful. But Cumberbatch taps into another Assange a man who in this telling suffered an abusive childhood. The result is an interpretation of Assange that may or may not be correct but hes a convincing familiar figure the wounded soul striking back from his safe dark corner of cyberspace. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? If only the rest of this movie were up to Cumberbatchs standards. Based on two books one a memoir by Assanges former colleague Daniel Domscheit-Berg (played by a likable Daniel Bruhl) ""The Fifth Estate"" never truly penetrates its mysterious subject. It completely avoids the biggest question hanging over the man -- namely allegations of sexual misconduct with two women -- and instead focuses on his refusal to redact the names of undercover operatives when publishing more than 250000 diplomatic cables. Directed by Bill Condon (the final ""Twilight"" movies) and written by Josh Singer ""The Fifth Estate"" -- the title is a phrase loosely applied to citizen journalists -- feels wonky and theoretical. A subplot involving Alexander Siddig as an endangered informant plus Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci as panicked government insiders add only superficial thrills. David Thewlis as Guardian journalist Nick Davies gets the thankless job of summing up the lessons weve all learned in a closing speech. The films best sequence is its opening credits a history of information from the hieroglyph to the Gutenberg press to todays speedy streams of ones and zeros. For the most part though when Cumberbatch isnt on the screen it grows dim.

In the new millennium we largely live our lives in cyberspace. But the 20th century syntax of cinema like the 15th century syntax of the printed word is struggling to keep pace.There are very few good movies about journalism and even fewer about computers. ""The Fifth Estate"" succeeds on at least the latter count. This thriller about the game-changing website Wikileaks is as smart about cyberspace as ""The Social Network"" but theres a glitch when it shifts the focus from felonious leaders to the misdemeanors of the man who exposed them.That man is Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch in a star-making feat) the Australian hacker who created his website as an anonymous place for whistleblowers to make noise about war crimes and corruption. We meet Assange in 2007 when he blusters into Berlin for a cyberpunk summit. Dissed by the desk staff he is recognized and rescued by idealistic German hacker Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl).Over the next three years Assange and Berg become partners in crime-busting and as the two tech wizards develop a platform for posting documents director Bill Condon (""Kinsey"" ""Dreamgirls"") employs some impressive effects to represent connectivity from a techno soundtrack to a hall-of-mirrors motif to symbolize their projects global ambitions.The irony is that Berg thinks Wikileaks is a worldwide network of hactivists -- when its really just Assange and his laptop.Soon the movie morphs into a critique of Assange and his supposed peculiarities and thats where ""The Fifth Estate"" stumbles. The tipping point is a scene where Bergs mate (Alicia Vikander) complains that a Wikileaks report about Kenyan death squads is spoiling their sex life. And at that very moment Assange pounds on their apartment door looking for a late-night place to quaff caffeine and subvert governments. Theres still some startling socio-political revelations here as when Wikileaks posts a video of American forces killing Iraqi civilians and Western journalists by remote control. But notwithstanding a linchpin performance by David Thewlis as a gutsy editor for Britains Guardian newspaper Condon and screenwriter Josh Stringer narrow the narrative in debatable ways. A subplot about a State Department employee (Laura Linney) trying to save a Wikileaks-outed spy (Alexander Siddig) gets screen time that rightly belongs to innocent bystanders in the decade-long war. Meanwhile as major American newspapers that betrayed Assange are let off the hook (Im looking at you Grey Lady) the disillusioned Daniel Berg is invited back to center stage to reveal that his former friend dyes his hair.Seriously.""The Fifth Estate"" is a a well-acted vividly directed drama about current events but its dubious to treat truth-tellers as ""The Anti-Social Network.""What ""The Fifth Estate""  Three stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 208  Content Mature language and war violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

This movie isnt terrible enough to derail the ""Sherlock Holmes"" stars upward trajectory toward pop-culture domination but Cumberbatchs subtle and intriguing performance as the inscrutable Aussie loner behind WikiLeaks is surrounded by a plodding and minor melodrama thats ludicrously ill suited to the material. Assange meanwhile has orchestrated a campaign of invective against director Bill Condons film and even against Cumberbatch from his self-exile in Londons Ecuadorian embassy but he neednt have bothered. The world will little note nor long remember this damped-down mistimed dishwater retelling of one of our young centurys signal events.Maybe theres a great work of fiction or cinema or philosophy or some yet-to-be-invented form of multi-platform digital opera to be derived from the story of Julian Assange WikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning. This isnt it although I suppose one could say that for some notional middle-stratum viewer who knows almost nothing about the story ""The Fifth Estate"" provides a capable retelling that doesnt get any of the major known facts completely wrong. What it never does is rise to the level its subject deserves and I am not talking mainly or exclusively about the portrayal of Assange and whether he is seen as good or evil. Mainstream narrative cinema - and mainstream documentary cinema too including Alex Gibneys flawed but far more informative ""We Steal Secrets"" - focuses intensely on character and personality on seemingly untethered questions of individual morality. These are almost irresistible in the case of Julian Assange a charismatic vainglorious and larger-than-life personality who seems like a combination of a Marvel Comics supervillain Thomas Paine and John Miltons Satan waging fruitless warfare against the throne of heaven.A fictional portrait of Assange yearns to be grandiose and Wagnerian in the mode of Christopher Nolan. (Assanges one-time hacker nickname Splendide Mendax a phrase drawn from Horace that is usually translated ""nobly untruthful"" also describes Nolans version of the Batman.) Or it could be worshipful fan fiction or a work of fractured and unwatchable postmodernism. Can we be positive that Assange was not born as an epigram-spouting background character in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" or as a hard-eyed revolutionary ladykiller in a forgotten Godard film from 1972? As for the question of whether to view Assange as a saint or a demon its a trap and ultimately not an interesting one. The real issues as even he would agree are much bigger than that and none of us yet knows how history will judge the legacy of WikiLeaks and the immense trove of government secrets it set free. It all depends of course on who will end up writing the history.Josh Singers screenplay for ""The Fifth Estate"" was adapted from two books that are largely critical of Assange. The most important source was clearly ""Inside WikiLeaks My Time With Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website"" by Daniel Domscheit-Berg a German programmer and hacker who became one of Assanges closest associates and then the leading WikiLeaks defector and dissident. As played by the agreeable Daniel Bruhl in the film Domscheit-Berg is an early believer in Assanges gospel of revolutionary transparency and info-liberation but one who is repeatedly seduced and abandoned. He believes Assanges rhetoric about WikiLeaks and its ""hundreds of volunteers"" when the movie makes it clear from the beginning that the white-haired genius is a one-man show. He believes the digital architecture of the WikiLeaks platform is secure when it turns out to be easily cracked and he believes Assange will conceal the names of vulnerable civilians in the hundreds of thousands of United States military logs from Iraq and Afghanistan leaked by Private Manning. You Might Also Like The movies Berg keeps going away in tears and coming back for more abuse like a jilted girlfriend. In one scene on a rocky Icelandic beach Cumberbatchs moody Assange explains that he may be on the autism spectrum which is why hes so hard on the people around him. (While that sounds like a plausible hypothesis as regards Assanges personality I have no idea how to judge the veracity of this anecdote.) All this Berlin-to-Nairobi-to-Reykjavik melodrama creates insoluble problems for the filmmakers but not quite in the way Assange and his loyalists think.Its not that the portrait of the WikiLeaks impresario is too unflattering but that the bigger story - or what ought to be the bigger story anyway -- is swallowed up in the trivial details of a failed geek bromance. Assange meets Bergs perfectly lovely middle-class parents - and OMG flees out the bathroom window because hes too much of a maladjusted creep to make it through a polite dinner Meanwhile oh yeah ""Collateral Murder"" all the disastrous details of two failed wars and all the State Departments most precious foreign-policy cables. Whatever Lets get back to the burning question of whether or not Assange dyes his hair or whether it turned white in his youth as he has sometimes claimed. (Nothing speaks more clearly to Assanges isolation in that London embassy or to his lack of both common sense and good P.R. advice that he has chosen to dispute this detail.)In a recent statement accompanying the release of his overwrought open letter to Cumberbatch in which he detailed his refusal to meet the actor personally Assange described ""The Fifth Estate"" as ""a film by the old media about the new media."" Self-serving as that may be Im afraid its also dead-on. Condon who directed the last two ""Twilight"" movies and ""Dreamgirls"" is a competent and ethical Hollywood craftsman of the old school. But he has no particular feeling for this material and the only container Singers script provides is a combination of stale character drama and warmed-over thriller. Condons efforts to represent the digital world of WikiLeaks with dreamlike shots of an infinitely receding office full of multiple Julian Assanges feel as forced as the pseudo-hip graffiti-laden Berlin nightclubs where chicks with funny haircuts make out with each other. ""The Fifth Estate"" also uneasily tries to address the way WikiLeaks interacted with the mainstream media; Guardian reporter Nick Davies an important collaborator and critic of Assanges is played by David Thewlis delivering homilies about How Significant This All Is. In an ill-considered subplot that must have struck someone somewhere as an important balance note Laura Linney Stanley Tucci and Anthony Mackie play Obama administration officials struggling with the effects of all the WikiLeaks revelations. (Bradley Manning as Chelsea was then known is mentioned but never appears.) I believe that Condon and Cumberbatch and the other people who made ""The Fifth Estate"" had approximately good intentions and the film is watchable and intermittently entertaining. But in telling four or five different stories at once they muddy them all fatally. Instead of the transparent open-source version of the WikiLeaks story this is the bug-filled Windows 8 beta version.

"Review WikiLeaks duos relationship powers up The Fifth Estate - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review WikiLeaks duos relationship powers up The Fifth Estate Only a handful of movies qualify for the exclusive club of films that have taken in more than 1 billion in worldwide box office -- and only three have made more than 2 billion. By Charles Fleming | Sources Los Angeles Times Box Office Mojo Kenneth Turan In its own Hollywood way ""The Fifth Estate"" is quite an ambitious film. It wants to create a viable portrait of Julian Assange the wildly controversial founder of WikiLeaks dramatize the significant but complex questions his work raises and surround both of those themes with the kind of personal dramas so beloved by mainstream films.The surprise in this film starring actor-of-the-moment Benedict Cumberbatch as Assange and Daniel Bruhl as his associate Daniel Domscheit-Berg and directed by Bill Condon is not that all of these goals are met -- that would be too much to expect -- but which ones are successful and which ones prove to be beyond everyones grasp. Given the talents of Cumberbatch and Bruhl whose credits include ""Good Bye Lenin"" ""Inglourious Basterds"" and the current ""Rush"" it is no surprise that the interplay between Assange and Domscheit-Berg the way their relationship shifted from engaged collaborators to enraged antagonists is the films greatest strength.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot moments As written by ""West Wing"" veteran Josh Singer and directed by Condon who took on a similar task with ""Kinsey"" ""The Fifth Estate"" does a solid job making audiences consider the pros and cons of issues involving governmental secrecy complicity with power and the price of openness. The back and forth on-screen will not replace the conversation in the New York Review of Books but seeing a studio film deal with issues at all is more than were used to.Ironically ""The Fifth Estate"" is at its most frustrating where it might have been suspected of being strongest which is the creation of drama outside the main events involving the leads. The periodic attempts the film makes to add peripheral interest to the main story come up short in ways Cumberbatch and Bruhl manage to avoid.""The Fifth Estate"" opens in 2010 with WikiLeaks greatest triumph the coordinated release through three mainstream outlets -- the New York Times the U.K.s Guardian and Germanys Der Spiegel -- of a trove of leaked sensitive materials including 400000 documents from the Iraq war and hundreds of thousands of classified diplomatic cables. It should have been a moment of shared triumph for Domscheit-Berg and Assange but by this point they were barely speaking to each other.PHOTOS Celebrities by The Times Because Domscheit-Bergs book ""Inside WikiLeaks"" is one of screenwriter Singers key sources we then flash back a few years and begin to see events from his rather than Assanges point of view.With Assange criticizing the film vehemently in numerous forums and the filmmakers freely admitting that a certain amount of fictionalizing takes place complete veracity is not to be expected but as with ""The Social Network"" the relationship between the protagonists feels emotionally accurate.The flashbacks begin in Berlin in 2008 and introduce us to Domscheit-Berg the resident computer genius for a bank who is anti-establishment enough to ride his bike through the office as attractive co-worker Anke (""A Royal Affairs"" Alicia Vikander) looks on approvingly.PHOTOS Greatest box office flopsDomscheit-Berg and Assange meet at something called the Chaos Communication Congress a hackers assembly where Assange though he established WikiLeaks two years earlier is still pretty much an unknown quantity.Given how anyone who knows anything about WikiLeaks today can tell you that it was then-Pvt. Bradley Manning who leaked all those Iraq war documents it is fascinating to be reminded that the organizations original attraction was its ability through elaborate encryption technology to hide the names of leakers and remove the fear of retribution. As Assange himself says quoting Oscar Wilde ""Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask and he will tell you the truth.""Obsessed and arrogant committed and charismatic Assange is certainly a complicated compelling character and Cumberbatch does a convincing job of creating a lone wolf provocateur who speaks in slogans like ""change is contagious"" and never doubts he is on the side of the angels. Guardian editor David Leigh whose book is one of the films sources has been quoted as saying Cumberbatchs imperturbable performance is ""creepily like the Julian I knew"" and it is the heart of the film as well.PHOTOS Fall movie sneaks 2013Though inevitably a bit overshadowed by his colleague Bruhl does excellent work as well by bringing intelligence and energy to what could have been a second-banana role. He makes us understand how seductive the WikiLeaks mission was when it involved obvious bad guys like Swiss banks committing tax fraud as well as how shocked he was when he realized he and Assange comprised the entire organization.Then comes trouble in the form of the Bradley Manning episode the biggest leak of classified information ever. While Assange is absolutely insistent that ""this is information the world needs to know"" Domscheit-Berg worries that peoples lives will needlessly be put at risk and fissures in the friendship start to expand. While this sounds somewhat schematic it plays better than that because the two actors bring quite a bit to their roles and because the script has worked hard to make the issues feel real and relevant.Less successful unfortunately are ""The Fifth Estates"" peripheral dramas. Subplots like the understandable irritation Domscheit-Bergs eventual girlfriend Anke feels at Assanges constant presence and a bigger story line about U.S. State Department types Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci worrying about a Libyan informant the leaks jeopardize are undramatic and unconvincing. Whenever ""The Fifth Estate"" leaves the involving one-on-one drama between Assange and Domscheit-Berg you wish it wouldnt.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review The Fifth Estate A Hollywood Cartoon of Julian Assange In Dreamgirls director Bill Condons bio-pic the WikiLeaks saga becomes a lopsided bromance By Richard Corliss Oct. 16 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle DreamWorks Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture From an early review of The Fifth Estate a biopic about Julian Assange and his whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks ""I do not believe that this film is a good film ... DreamWorks has based its entire production on the two most discredited books on the market ... [The film] does not seek to simplify clarify or distill the truth but rather it seeks to bury it ... It is distorted truth about living people doing battle with titanic opponents. It is a work of political opportunism influence revenge and above all cowardice ... It seeks ... to cut principle with hypocrisy ... to cut the truth with lies ... to create a work not of fiction but of debased truth."" The severe critic is Assange himself in a letter penned Jan. 15 to Benedict Cumberbatch the English actor who was to play Assange in The Fifth Estate and had requested to visit him in the Ecuadorian embassy in London Assanges refuge since June 2012. Assange presumably after reading a version of Josh Singers script (you neednt ask how he got a copy) signaled his admiration for Cumberbatch and his ""inexpressible regret"" at declining a meeting before launching his salvo against the film. The letter published recently in Variety is worth reading in full for its insight into the mind of the movies subject. (READ Julian Assange on being played by Benedict Cumberbatch) Cumberbatch says the letter gave him ""real cause for concern"" but resolved to complete the project because it resonated with his belief in civil liberties. He says he wants to prove that Assange is not just ""a weird white-haired Australian dude wanted in Sweden hiding in an embassy behind Harrods. But a true force to be reckoned with [who] achieved the realization of the great ideal."" (READ Benedict Cumberbatch on playing Julian Assange) This exchange as well as the very existence of the movie shows how the information unearthed by WikiLeaks has made less impact on the popular consciousness -- and gets less press attention -- than the personality of the sites founder. Consider that since Assanges flight to the Ecuadorian embassy 16 months ago WikiLeaks has published the Syria files -- more than 2 million e-mails and papers from Assads government -- and a hundred or so classified files from the U.S. Defense Department revealing its policy on detainees at Guantanamo and elsewhere. Early this year WikiLeaks released CIA and State Department documents from the 1970s including secret cables from Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. Last month it posted a new installment of its Spy Files 3 project detailing the internal workings of European companies specializing in surveillance technology. Thats corporate spying to you or maybe on you. All very noteworthy and newsworthy. But WikiLeaks hasnt received the coverage that a few years ago secured its reputation as the top source for exposes of government and industrial corruption. The Iraq and Syria War Logs which the site obtained from U.S. Army analyst Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning made news around the world thanks in part to the editorial validation of the Guardian the New York Times and Der Spiegel. (READ James Poniewozik on the Bradley and Chelsea Manning story) That was in 2010 so very long ago that it makes Assange and the site he founded seem almost nostalgia items. The same with The Fifth Estate a high-energy empty-calorie portrait of the Wonder from Down Under. Directed by Bill Condon who made his name in biopics (Gods and Monsters Kinsey) before going old Broadway with Dreamgirls and young adult with the last two Twilight movies The Fifth Estate crams a spanning-the-globe crash course in international politics into the crevices of a lopsided bromance. True to expectations it concentrates less on the meat of the leaks than on Assanges lofty personality. After all the young Ralph Nader revealed plenty of juicy facts about corporate chicanery and Hollywood made no movie about him. (READ TIMEs 1966 story on Ralph Nader and General Motors) As Aaron Sorkins script for The Social Network traced the spiral of admiration into disillusionment in the relationship of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his colleague Eduardo Saverin so The Fifth Estate fictionalizes or possibly falsifies the collaboration of Assange and fellow hacker-activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl). Domscheit-Bergs memoir of Assange and WikiLeaks is one of the sources for the screenplay by Singer who had written for Sorkins TV series The West Wing. The other is WikiLeaks Inside Julian Assanges War on Secrecy by David Leigh and Luke Harding of the Guardian. In Assanges us-vs.-them worldview both books would be clearly on the them side. (READ TIMEs review of The Social Network) They meet in Berlin in 2007 and quickly become in the words of the film Assange ""an army of two"" -- rather an army of one supreme commander and one devoted obliging grunt. In a splendid shot Assange is seen working on his computer in a huge office; track slowly back and all the desks are manned by Assanges. Using a myriad of false IDs to make WikiLeaks appear fully staffed he is everywhere and everyone. What upsets Daniel is that Julian may be a genius but hes no gentleman. He disses Daniels parents and barges in on his affair with the lovely Anke (Swedens Alicia Vikander the young charmer in the Keira Knightley Anna Karenina). The mandarin and the mensch are bound to collide and when they do WikiLeaks briefly crashes with them. Tall drawling and white-maned (he has dyed his hair ever since being inducted into an Australian cult as a child) Assange radiates a star quality that impresses all spectators especially himself. He gave WikiLeaks a charismatic face got more coverage for the sites reports including the cover of TIME even as his prima-donna personality often upstaged the news he was making. In the movie he complains that the media concentrate less on stories about corruption in Kenya than about ""how weird I am."" At the end of the film he says that the Internet age gives power to anyone with a grievance and some evidence to back it up. ""Its all about you"" he proclaims indirectly alluding to TIMEs 2006 Person of the Year. A pause and a smile. ""And a little about me too."" (READ TIMEs 2010 cover story on Julian Assange) The movie is all about him and thus about Cumberbatch. The actor who brought his plummy hauteur to the revived Khan character in Star Trek Into Darkness and who co-stars in this weeks 12 Years a Slave manages to occupy glamorize and parody Assange. He is a mix of tics and grandeur a creature apart and above both worldly and otherworldly. No one so conscious of his own legend and so practiced in promoting it is likely also to be a decent caring human being. That is Daniel at least in this movie made from his book. But nice doesnt make for scintillating cinema not when naughty is there to steal every scene. (READ Corlisss take on Benedict Cumberbatch in Star Trek Into Darkness) Singer and Condon offer a little sympathy for the devil with occasional references to his peculiar upbringing his time with the cult known as the Family and the revelation that he was in his 20s before he met his birth father. He also mentions that he has a 19-year-old son named ... Daniel suggesting a paternal affection for Domscheit-Berg (who is only seven years younger than Assange). Having established the father-son connection The Fifth Estate then casts Julian as Darth Nader to Daniels Luke Skyhacker dueling not with light sabers but with computer strokes. In the process the impact of WikiLeaks is reduced to a workplace drama about a brilliant boss who mistreated his one wonderful employee. Told in a jazzy chaotic style that throws computer algorithms and text messages on the screen and with dialogues that the camera keeps swiveling and jerking to catch up with The Fifth Estate means to be both a filmic and an Internet experience. But its really an old-fashioned falling-out-of-love story as seen from Domscheit-Bergs perspective. It upends Assanges battle cry of ""Privacy for the individual transparency for the institutions"" and exposes the exposer as in Cumberbatchs words ""a weird white-haired Australian dude.""

RELATED NEWS Interview Benedict Cumberbatch on Fifth Estate By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Oct 17 2013 1110 AM The story of WikiLeaks is fascinating; the telling of it in ""The Fifth Estate"" somewhat less so. Bill Condons film traces the online organization from its roots inside Julian Assanges curious head to the point when WikiLeaks the New York Times the Guardian of London and Der Spiegel in Germany published simultaneously war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and 250000 U.S. diplomatic cables. Along the way there were plenty of other leaks and lots of interpersonal drama most of it stemming from Assanges ego. Pretty good stuff as you can learn in ""We Steal Secrets The Story of WikiLeaks"" Alex Gibneys exhaustive entertaining take on the subject. (By the way its the U.S. government that steals them not WikiLeaks.) But Condon chooses to focus more on Assange which is not a fatal flaw because Benedict Cumberbatch plays him with an oddball intensity perfectly suitable to the subject. Yet instead of delving into the moral questions WikiLeaks asks by its very existence Condon gives those a passing nod in a couple of weak subplots. Instead he focuses more on Assange and his relationship with Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) the German computer wiz who would go from adoring fanboy to disillusioned cynic (and on whose memoir the script is partly based). The obvious antecedent here is ""The Social Network"" David Finchers brilliant film about Mark Zuckerberg and the disputed founding of Facebook. ""The Fifth Estate"" doesnt match that films ambition or execution. But Cumberbatch is great. Berg meets Assange at a hackers convention and the two hit it off which is to say Berg admires Assange and Assange sees someone in Berg he can use to build his operation. Assange is a wheeler-dealer from the start overstating the size of his operation. But he doesnt overstate his zeal in exposing secrets (at least everyone elses). Berg brings in friends and the leaks start to mount. WikiLeaks reveals corruption in all sorts of places such as a Swiss bank and blasts out personal information about British government figures. But the world really took notice when the site posted video of U.S. troops killing two Reuters reporters (and bragging about it) they mistakenly thought were enemy combatants. Then an Army soldier named Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning downloaded hundreds of thousands of documents onto a CD labeled ""Lady Gaga"" and passed it on to Assange (in the film the rest of his small staff was at first unaware of this). This would be the largest release of classified documents in history. The Times Guardian and other mainstream media outlets were interested because of the sometimes-shocking revelations exposed. But they were worried too about the names that would be revealed and wanted them redacted to protect those the release would put in danger. Assange makes some mealy-mouthed assurances that hell get around to it. Dont bet on it. Meanwhile Condon drops in occasionally on a couple of State Department employees (Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci) who worry about their contacts (and their jobs) and Alexander Siddig who portrays one of those contacts. His character gets about five minutes of a tense scene that seems to have dropped in from another movie. David Thewlis is good as Nick Davies the Guardian reporter who understands both the promise and the threat of WikiLeaks. Assange simply doesnt care about the well-being of others. Why? His lack of trust and problems with authority are spelled out generally by his upbringing in a cult. Assange would eventually be arrested on charges of sexual assault and is currently holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. The best bit of the movie is at the end in a postscript set inside the embassy when Assange (Cumberbatch not the real one) discusses the idea of a WikiLeaks film. And what of WikiLeaks? Some argue that it is a bold development in free speech. Others -- including governments of various nations such as our own -- argue that it is a dangerous dumping ground where everything is fair game to be published for the world to see. Its a fascinating question and an important one and one that ""The Fifth Estate"" gives too little attention. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

The Fifth Estate Credit Frank Connor/DreamWorks By Peter Travers October 17 2013 More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview Hastings Interview with Julian Assange All Stories >> Maybe its because the tale of WikiLeaks mad genius Julian Assange is still being written but The Fifth Estate never settles down long enough to make a case for or against this controversial figure. It helps that British actor Benedict Cumberbatch excels as the digital whistle-blower from Australia who became notorious for giving other whistle-blowers a protected digital forum to leak classified documents. Assange hit maximum exposure in 2010 when he linked up with The New York Times The Guardian and Der Spiegel to disseminate Bradley Mannings cache of state secrets. More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview Hastings Interview with Julian Assange All Stories >> How did Assange get to the point where he must seek asylum at Ecuadors London embassy while his enemies scream for his extradition including the Swedish police who want him for questioning in a sexual-assault case? Thats the movie. And it runs around frantically trying to squeeze it all in. Working from a script by Josh Singer (Fringe) director Bill Condon (Gods and Monsters Kinsey) - finally free from the gunk of two Twilight movies - at least tries to perform due diligence to the narrative. In 2007 the loner Assange begins collaborating with German technocrat Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl of Rush) whose book Inside WikiLeaks My Time With Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website is one of the sources of the screenplay. As a result Domscheit-Berg comes off mostly credible Assange mostly creepy. Its fun to watch fine actors like Cumberbatch and Bruhl go at each other. But the feuds and romances at the o ffice and the subplot with Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci as State Department cogs feel like filler. Its ironic that Alex Gibneys recent WikiLeaks doc uploads the same material with more dramatic oomph. The Fifth Estate is stuck running in place.

Comments click to enlarge The Fifth Estate Recommended Video Rated R  128 minutes  2013 The rise of WikiLeaks including its controversial publication of more than a quarter million U.S. diplomatic cables in 2010 makes for a polished and engrossing Hollywood thriller smartly scripted by West Wing veteran Josh Singer. In some respects this mimics The Social Network with complex graphics hammering home the technical innovations that drive the story and a central conflict between two unequal collaborators who eventually fall out with each other--in this case Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) who invented the online clearinghouse for whistleblower documents and Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) whose book about WikiLeaks was denounced by Assange and became source material for this film. Singer wisely avoids the murky sexual assault charges subsequently leveled against Assange sticking instead to the more vexing question of whether WikiLeaks represents the death of responsible journalism or a necessary challenge to a defunded and compromised fourth estate.

"Review Fifth Estate is short on big ideas - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Fifth Estate is short on big ideasBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 10/16/2013 123047 PM PDTUpdated 10/16/2013 012843 PM PDT Related StoriesOct 16Benedict Cumberbatch plays Assange -- over Assanges protestsAt one point during ""The Fifth Estate"" Julian Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) debates with colleagues whether to simply dump thousands of classified documents onto his website without actually reading them all -- or at least redacting names. ""WikiLeaks doesnt edit"" he says simply.For a movie that jump-starts its plot without much context during the first half its a surprisingly simple and effective summation of Assange and the crux of the WikiLeaks debate Where does the public need to know end and the need for government secrecy begin?Its a complicated issue one that needs to be presented on the big screen in a similarly complicated way. But the problem with ""The Fifth Estate"" which opens Friday is that it hits the ground sprinting like an action movie and the big ideas dont solidify until it slows down enough to let the storys inherent suspense emerge. Perhaps thats the danger in making a film in which you have to fill in the blanks while the real history is still shaking itself out.Based on the books ""Inside WikiLeaks My Time with Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website"" by German tech activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg (played by Daniel Bruhl) and ""WikiLeaks Inside Julian Assanges War on Secrecy"" by David Leigh and Luke Harding ""The Fifth Estate"" centers on Assange and Domscheit-Berg and their quest to expose government secrets on their Internet platform. Before long theyre scooping the established news media and drawing scrutiny from powerful people by exposing death squads in Kenya fraud inside a Swiss bank and U.S. military prisoner abuses. Advertisement Rather than tell the story chronologically director Bill Condon (""Kinsey"" ""Dreamgirls"") hops around in time and seems to throw us into the middle of a movie that started before we got to the theater. All of this makes it difficult to fathom just why these online crusaders are determined enough to put themselves in so much danger. For better or worse Assanges motives remain ambiguous enough to leave viewers still wondering about him when the film is done. Some dream sequences and flashbacks are meant to add context and shed light on motives but they just muddy the waters.When hes given enough time and space to stretch out his portrayal Cumberbatch is great in the role capturing Assanges complex persona -- at times admirable at times abrasive -- and dogged determination. However his bromance drama with Bruhl doesnt add much to the film. The story gets bigger and much better when military whistle-blower Bradley Manning enters the picture. Manning who has since changed genders and now identifies herself as Chelsea Manning is not portrayed by an actor but simply appears in a photo. As the source of whats been called the biggest classified intelligence breach in history Manning prompts WikiLeaks and other media outlets to grapple with what to do with the information while U.S. officials scramble to limit the damage (Laura Linney is typically convincing as a diplomat watching her career crumble as she tries countering the leaks). Finally the film confronts the ethical questions that should have been at the heart of ""The Fifth Estate"" from the start. In addition the focus on shifting ethical attitudes in a new information society finally takes hold and drives the movie. (Matters such as Assanges arrest on suspicion of sexual assault and his extradition fight are covered briefly at films end but do not overshadow the bigger points.) Ultimately ""The Fifth Estate"" accomplishes its intent offering some insight into an important milestone in history and prompting viewers to question and debate what they have just witnessed. Unfortunately it takes too long to get there.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.The Fifth Estate   Rating R (for languageand some violence)Cast Benedict Cumberbatch Daniel Bruhl Carice van Houten Laura Linney Stanley TucciDirector Bill CondonRunning time 2 hours 8 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

In an age of leaking top-secret government documents that endanger the lives of millions under the bogus guise of the publics right to know we get The Fifth Estate a disappointing and incomprehensible biopic about Australian cyberpunk Julian Assange founder of WikiLeaks the controversial website dedicated to posting more than three-quarters of a million classified government and corporate documents about the Afghanistan war. Journalism used to be a noble profession referred to as the Fourth Estate. With the bastardized rape of ethics that now blasts forth from the Internet turning teenage hackers into unedited self-aggrandizing experts on everything from sex and politics to movies and 100 recipes for meatloaf the new term for journalism is now the Fifth Estate hence the title and disgrace of a film by a director I have enormously admired on previous occasions (Gods and MonstersKinsey and Dreamgirls to name three). In an interview on the occasion of the films mixed reviews at this years Toronto Film Festival Mr. Condon was quoted ""It was a constant puzzle to figure out how to tell the story and get across all the information but still keep it exciting and entertaining."" He struck out on all counts. Mr. Condon and the excellent West Wing writer Josh Singer have failed to make the egomaniacal Julian Assange anything more than an arrogant quasi-terrorist obsessed with whistle-blowing who grew greedy in his eagerness to rise to the top of the ""get famous"" business by causing as much chaos and panic as possible. Instead of the ""privacy vs. transparency"" issue in the Internet age that drove Edward Snowden to seek asylum in Moscow (with an assist from Assange his ally in the spy game) the films focus is on Assange as a personality and he comes off as a repellent leech whose lust for notoriety extended beyond exposing hidden facts about secret missions of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. He also exposed massive tax dodges in Swiss banks protests in Tibet and the Church of Scientology causing global turmoil with one nonprofit website a couple of fake email addresses and his right-arm deputy the sympathetic German hacker Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl). It was a two-man operation jeopardizing lives and accountable to no one until his partner began to question the virtue of publishing 750000 U.S. military logs and diplomatic cables and turned him in destroying his own little planet of tyranny and driving Assange into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. Hes still there avoiding extradition to Sweden where he faces sexual assault charges. What a story. What a downfall. And what a movie if only some attempt had been made to humanize Assange. But he is played by the suddenly overexposed overrated and almost incomprehensible British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares better in two other new films employing Southern dialects in both 12 Years a Slave and August Osage County without the pasty skin white wigs ugly prosthetics and phony Australian accent that makes him sound like hes struggling with a mouth full of wet plastic bread wrappers. Laura Linney David Thewlis and Stanley Tucci are wasted in minor roles of no consequence. The best thing about the movie based on the bookInside WikiLeaks by Assange lieutenant-turned-traitor Domscheit-Berg and reports by London journalists David Leigh and Luke Harding is the sobering picture it paints of 21st-century journalism where anonymity reigns supreme and ruthless amateurs get away with everything. Timely but sluggish and confusing The Fifth Estate will be a hard sell. Corruption in cyberspace should be a helluva lot more entertaining than this.

And as a sensible person you probably were curious--even heartened--to hear that Cumberbatch would be appearing in Bill Condons The Fifth Estate as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange a real person from our real world albeit a fellow still touched with something like mad-genius magic. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Or maybe you saw photos of Cumberbatch done up with stringy white hair and hoped he was playing Michael Moorcocks Elric of Melnibone. Whatever.Regardless at some point youve probably thought ""Wow Cumberbatch as Assange--Id like to see that."" The good news is that deep into the back end of The Fifth Estate just before the credits you actually do when Cumberbatch faces a camera straight-on and gets to act for a good 40 seconds. Hes marvelous his Assange equal parts charisma and nerves moral zeal and pushy self-righteousness a leader of info-warriors and the consummate outcast. Cumberbatch speaks in a put-upon gush his Assange sick of all the time people waste by making him spell out the truths he considers self-evident. But he also thrives on the mere fact that people are listening. Pale as he is he glows from within.Film Details The Fifth Estate RatingR GenreDrama Running Time124 More Info He might be that good the rest of the movie too. But I defy to you say for sure. Other than that brief scene when Assange is addressing a fixed camera his every moment is diced up by reckless senseless cuts. Early on Assange gives a warm-up speech in a near-empty lecture hall. Hes a little uncertain at first his stray thoughts gathering and finally accumulating power but Condon cuts and paces this not like a scene of slow-burn performance but like Cumberbatch is Jason Bourne escaping an airport.Since the movie has no one else to cut to most of the quick jagged shots of Cumberbatch speaking give way to quick jagged shots of Cumberbatch speaking from a slightly different angle none more revealing than any other and none keyed to anything that Cumberbatch is doing or we might be feeling. These shards pile up but they dont communicate--its like director Condon broke a mirror and is asking our brains to glue it back together for him.Its almost appropriate that the movie rarely gives us a good look at Assange since Condon and screenwriter Josh Singer--working from a pair of books on WikiLeaks including Daniel Domscheit-Bergs insider tell-all--never seem to have worked out who they think this guy is other than a bad BFF.The Fifth Estate follows Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) Assanges early partner and here a milquetoast audience surrogate from WikiLeaks first info-dumps right up to the watershed 2010 release--by the site the Guardian and the New York Times together--of tens of thousands of U.S. documents concerning diplomatic efforts and the war in Afghanistan.This Assange starts heroic and inspiring liberating Domscheit-Berg from a job he hates for the work of exposing corruption and speaking truth to power. But then Assange turns megalomanic and needs some truth told to him too. As the movie wears on and the friendship frays Domscheit-Berg suffers third-act disillusionment--it turns out that cavalierly dumping reams of state secrets on the Internet might put some lives in danger Cumberbatch is reduced to expectorating stern statements of first principles ""Wikileaks doesnt edit"" he declares at Domscheit-Berg as if the reasons why are obvious his hard-assed conviction not far off from Danny Trejos ""Machete dont tweet.""The issues at play here are fascinating but Condon and Singer never let any argument about journalism or the philosophy of free information last longer than a couple ping-ponged lines between master (Assange) and student (Domscheit-Berg). Instead theyre always off to the next leak the next buddy-drama travail the next desperate attempt to make it look as if this isnt a movie about dudes typing at each other. The low point has to be Condons visual metaphor for the Internet itself When Assange and Domscheit-Berg are online we see them sitting at desks in an infinite office with sand for floor and sky for ceiling. Sometimes when working on a leak the boys page through file folders--its the revolution as dreamed by the staffing folks at your local temp agency. Silly as it is its a rare flourish of invention in a film that for all its restlessness feels staid and dated.Like J.J. Abramss TV dramas The Fifth Estate opens at the most interesting moment and then flashes way back to show how we got there. Like globe-trotting spy pictures there are labeled establishing shots for each international location. Theres the boho Euro underground hacker culture the panicked U.S. State Department exposition-deliverers (including Laura Linney) even something of a countdown clock. It all hews so closely to template that its easy to imagine that paperclip from Microsoft Word popping up on Condons desktop one day to say ""It looks like youre directing a techno-thriller.

Bill Condons first post-""Twilight"" film offers a compelling complex portrait of the Wikileaks founder and yet it will probably do precisely what the actual Assange fears - namely paint him as a demagogue whose commitment to institutional corruption is more self-aggrandizing than sincere. A glossy engaging chronicle of alternative medias transition from redheaded stepchild to 800-pound gorilla - and one of its figureheads accompanying gains and losses - ""The Fifth Estate"" is a first-rate docudrama whose central theme doubles as a message well-heeded by its audience namely dont believe everything you see. Also read Gravity Review Sandra Bullock Shines in Alfonso Cuarons Poetic Tale Benedict Cumberbatch (""Star Trek Into Darkness"") plays Assange a scruffy computer hacker who cant get anyone to pay attention to his website the nonprofit news-leaking Wikileaks. Recruiting Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) to help with technical support not to mention get the site some publicity the two men gain notoriety by exposing corruption at Swiss bank Julius Baer and releasing video footage of a Baghdad airstrike that revealed U.S. bomb strikes on civilians. After receiving some 391000 U.S. army field reports that expose civilian deaths and other military cover-ups Assange and Domscheit-Berg reluctantly partner with traditional American and European media outlets to parse the material for publication. But when Assange pressures Berg to publish the documents without properly protecting the names of people whose identities would be revealed jeopardizing their lives a rift forms between the two of them as they battle over what is more important - government transparency or individual privacy. Adapted by Josh Singer (""Fringe"") from two different books about Wikileaks including one by Domscheit-Berg what the film does best is create a trajectory for Assange that puts audiences squarely on his side and then slowly confronts them with the potential repercussions of uncovering institutional secrecy. In Condons ""origin story"" for alternative media Assange plays both the hero and the villain representing an admirable commitment to unvarnished truth and at the same time a dangerous indifference to the careers ruined and in some cases lives lost as a result of exposing it. Also read Baggage Claim Review Woefully Outdated Look at the Challenges of Finding True Love Notwithstanding Condons silly representation of Wikileaks ""headquarters"" as a barren wasteland covered by newsroom paraphernalia Condon mostly avoids repetition in his (perhaps necessary) depiction of Assange and Domscheit-Berg pecking away at their computers. But in portraying their relationship almost as a platonic romance Condon isnt even-handed enough about its seemingly inevitable deterioration - if that balance ever interested him - to make us sympathetic to both sides inevitably validating Domscheit-Berg as the voice of reason while vilifying Assange as a sociopath. As the enigmatic Australian at the heart of the story Cumberbatch lends Assange more than superficial charm to win our sympathies but the films eventual clarification of his behavior - uncovering everyone elses secrets so that he can conceal his own - oversimplifies the ambiguity the actor lends his real-life counterpart. Meanwhile as Domnscheit-Berg Bruhl plays spectator to Assanges transformation -- initially enchanted by his idealism but eventually alienated by his fractious inflexibility - but he makes the character into something more substantial than merely an audience proxy. The movie does its best to discredit itself perhaps in a pre-emptive attempt to avoid criticisms of its one-sided portrayal of Assange and even goes so far as to include an epilogue in which Cumberbatchs character condemns it. But Condon seems to want to have his cake and eat it too making a film could defensibly be described as being both directly about Assange and ""just"" the whistleblower media that arose from his success in the process never quite justifying either his secondhand dramatization of Wikileaks reporting nor his dubiously one-sided portrait of the sites founder. Bereft of the context and more importantly counterbalance to provide the on-screen Julian Assange with the sort of transparency that his real-life counterpart so dearly values ""The Fifth Estate"" ultimately works better as a trigger for the curious to investigate further than an expose of the events themselves or even an examination of the people who first uncovered them.

The actor has already stepped into the shoes of Stephen Hawking Vincent Van Gogh and Sherlock Holmes. Right now hes making a film about troubled wartime codebreaker Alan Turing. And here he is in The Fifth Estate sporting lank white hair puffy eyes and a paranoid glare. He is Julian Assange WikiLeaks founder and depending where you stand radical crusader or crazed egomaniac - or both. The Fifth Estate indulges both views without offering much about the man that feels new or original. Bill Condons frenetic pacy movie feels like a character assessment in progress as it dashes through the rise of WikiLeaks and Assanges ballooning self-importance with the swiftness of a broadband speed not yet invented. It honours his ballsy achievements - gathering and publishing explosive political and corporate documents - and tries weakly to find some explanation in his childhood. It offers a very British view of Assange. It starts close to home in Kings Cross with The Guardian collaborating with Assange in 2010 in scenes that feel a bit like In the Loop without gags (partly because Peter Capaldi plays editor Alan Rusbridger). And it ends with the same journalists - David Thewlis plays investigative reporter Nick Davies - wondering if theyve created a monster. Inbetween it leaps back a few years to track how Assange recruited Daniel Schmitt (Daniel Bruhl) to assist his mission. Less convincing is the films leaning on a neon-cyber-grungy aesthetic as Assange spends time in Berlin. The film that The Fifth Estate most resembles is The Social Network. The parallels are clear a social outcast exorcising demons via technology; the vicious betrayal of a business partner; the swift transformation of news into drama. But The Fifth Estate doesnt have the same sharp focus or insight. Its adequate and often fun but no match for Cumberbatchs talents physically his Assange is far more complex and intriguing than most of the things we hear him say or see him do.

Dowd and Ben Kenigsberg Sep 6 2013 1140 AM Share Tweet Share Tweet The Toronto International Film Festival used to reserve its opening-night slot for homegrown productions (Passchendaele Score A Hockey Musical) but thats changed. Last year the fest boosted the hype factor by selecting Looper as its curtain-raiser and this year anticipation was arguably even higher for The Fifth Estate the inevitable Julian Assange movie. Indeed with the Manning verdict and Edward Snowdens WikiLeaks-abetted legal travails still in the news the film is in danger of being by upstaged by headlines at any moment. Its tempting to paraphrase George Wyner from Spaceballs ""Instant biopics Theyre out in theaters before the story is finished."" Except that The Fifth Estate (Grade C+) slick and superficially entertaining doesnt have much news to impart. The opening-credit montage pays tribute to the entire history of written communication beginning with the hieroglyph--and anyone whos paid even passing attention to a website newspaper or scroll since the onset of the decade will have a good sense of exactly how the film plays out. A would-be cross between The Social Network and Carlos The Fifth Estate stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Assange in the kind of mannered imitative performance best perfected through repeat viewings of 60 Minutes. Daniel Bruhl plays cohort Daniel Domscheit-Berg on whose book the film is based an idealist computer whiz who regards Assange as a visionary but eventually comes to see him as reckless for a reluctance to redact names (and also a distraction from settling down with his girlfriend played by Alicia Vikander). As a director Bill Condon has given us two wonderfully unconventional biopics Gods And Monsters (1998) and Kinsey (2004) both of which took a free hand but cut to the heart of the intellectual and creative capacities of the men. Jazzed up with woeful attempts to make chatrooms ""cinematic"" The Fifth Estate deals with Assange in broad terms skirting some of the color in this account by Bill Keller and essentially relegating his Swedish legal troubles to a footnote. The film presents arguments both pro and con Laura Linney is on hand as a State Department official charged with rescuing an outed source from Libya while David Thewlis delivers a cringingly on-the-nose monologue about the importance of radical thinking in journalism. For a film ostensibly advocating openness and access The Fifth Estate doesnt have much faith in its audience. Fortunately the fest offered an antidote in Frederick Wisemans towering At Berkeley (Grade A) a four-hour immersion in student life that puts a gratifying amount of trust in its viewers. Wisemans trademark non-involvement style at first seems an ill fit for an environment that allows students to pontificate at length. But over the course of an epic running time his trees-to-forest portrait--which includes classroom discussions of income disparities in education; debates on how to deal with state funding reductions; navigation of town-gown relations; a seminar on Walden and a scene from Our Town--patterns emerge. Academia is seen as an ongoing negotiation between idealism and pragmatism the individual and the community young and old students and faculty. Budgets have to be cut but lawns still have to be mowed if the university is still to retain a sense of prestige. An institution that prides itself on its diversity can still have racial tensions. At a protest students chant ""No cuts no fees. Education must be free"" to an administration filled with former radicals who are caught in a bind between what the university represents and what it can afford. Its significant that Wiseman despite living in Cambridge Massachusetts in the shadow of both Harvard and MIT has chosen as his subject one of the last few nominally public universities that consistently ranks among the best in the nation. Wisemans Berkeley is a microcosm of society Like the boxing gym in his Boxing Gym (2010) the college is viewed as a sort of utopia but an unsustainable one. ""Your education will never depreciate in value"" a campus financial advisor tells students struggling with debt obligations--a statement on which the film reserves judgment. The movie opens by suggesting that a founding principle of Berkeley was the notion that people should be able to study even if they arent part of an elite--yet from what we see of the way the college is run elitism is part and parcel of the academic experience. Why do we learn how do we learn and what is learning worth? Complex absorbing and pointed At Berkeley is an exhilarating examination of the ""education machine."" The day also offered an unusually high number of self-reflexive filmmaker portraits. Still banned from making movies Irans Jafar Panahi has pulled off another clandestine production Closed Curtain (Grade B)--a more overtly playful meditation on the creative ban than his great This Is Not A Film (2011) albeit a much more conventionally allegorical one. Cinema Scope editor Mark Peranson and Filipino filmmaker Raya Martin go gonzo in La Ultima Pelicula which follows an American director (Alex Ross Perry) heading down to Mexico to make a film on the eve of the Mayan apocalypse. Its an homage to--and even re-stages scenes from--Dennis Hoppers The Last Movie (1970) except with the impending death of celluloid that title can now be taken literally. (Of film stock Perry says at the outset ""We bought it all we shot it all."") Notably its one of only a handful of titles at Toronto thats not screening digitally. (I shouldnt give it a grade because Im on friendly terms with Peranson and Perry in real life.) Most mysterious was Catherine Breillats Abuse Of Weakness (Grade B-) essentially a veiled confession of Breillats apparent experience being swindled by a con man after she suffered a stroke. Isabelle Huppert plays a very different Breillat surrogate than Anne Parillauds manic caricature from Sex Is Comedy (2002). The movie is interesting to think about as another of the Anatomy Of Hell directors power-struggle portraits even if its conceit--by design--leaves the question of how the filmmaker allowed a known operator to bilk her out of so much money unresolved. --Ben Kenigsberg Unlike my industrious colleague who hit the ground running with a whopping five screenings I slacked off on my first day of TIFF with a mere two. Some of that was bad luck--I got shut out of the opening night Midnight Madness selection All Cheerleaders Die co-directed by the underrated Lucky McKee (May)--but it was also partially a matter of pacing myself. With six more days here in Toronto some of which Ill pack with just as many movies it seemed prudent to ease may way into the weeklong watching binge. Besides what better way to kick off this annual cinema summit than with a midday screening of The Past (Grade B+) my most anticipated film of not just the fest but also the year on a whole? Iranian director Asghar Farhadi dropped on a lot of radars with A Separation his 2011 masterpiece about a broken family and the tense legal crisis that engulfs it. The Past which premiered at Cannes in May to somewhat muted acclaim suffers slightly when compared to its predecessor in part because it finds Farhadi repeating some of the same narrative tricks. But the film also confirms the directors status as a contemporary master one with a gift for pressure-cooker dramatic scenarios and an acute understanding of how divorce--even when mutual--can send shockwaves through an extended family. On some level its possible to see The Past as a kind of alternate-universe version of A Separation examining what might have occurred in the earlier film had its heroine made good on her plans to leave the country. Here its the man (Ali Mosaffa) who fled returning to Iran and abandoning his wife (The Artists Berenice Bejo) and her children in France. (The girls--one a teenager the other a little younger--are from Bejos previous marriage.) The movie opens four years after the split with Mosaffa returning to Paris to sign divorce papers so that Bejo can tie the knot for a third time. Her new husband-to-be played by A Prophet star Tahar Rahim has a young son and a wife in a coma. Into this crowded household goes Mosaffa his reappearance upsetting the delicate uneasy balance inside. As in A Separation a calmly observational opening act gives way to tempests of emotion stirred up by secrets and lies. Whos withholding information and why becomes crucial. Alas theres something less than organic about the way Farhadi executes the transition this time. Partly thats because some of the complications hinge on the involvement of a supporting character who doesnt factor into the proceedings until later on. And the revelations stacked up against each other arent as expertly meted out as they are in A Separation. The Past is a less controlled film The drama occasionally collapses into melodrama; Bejo--whos terrific in the quieter scenes--is often asked to behave like a hysterical hot mess. (Part of what made A Separation so persuasive was that just about all the characters even the hotheaded ones acted in a way that felt relatable and understandable.) Flaws aside theres no denying the potency of the films thematic thrust. Farhadi possesses a keen understanding of the way our old relationships cling to our hearts jeopardizing our new ones. Per its on-the-nose title The Past is fundamentally--and somewhat ironically given the similarities to its predecessor--about how self-destructive it can be to dwell on yesterday. For me the movie works best when focusing on Mosaffas character a figure of intense but understated melancholy. Theres something unbearably moving about watching this man attempt for not entirely selfless reasons to mend the family hes lost. With no biological link to his exs children he has no place in their lives anymore but cant quite suppress his paternal affection for them. Nor can the kids entirely forget this surrogate father figure who disappeared from their home. Thats a very real circumstance that the movies rarely explore. If I can convince myself that its intrinsically linked to all the other... stuff that happens in the second half The Past may leap up in my estimation. The other film I caught on day one of the ""festival of festivals"" was also a Cannes holdover this years Palme DOr winner Blue Is The Warmest Color (Grade A-). In an unprecedented move Steven Spielberg and his Cannes jury gave the award not just to the films director Abdellatif Kechiche (The Secret Of The Grain) but also to its two young stars Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux. Having now seen the movie I can say that the decision makes perfect sense--the acting is not just crucial but kind of the whole show--though Id also argue that Seydouxs work isnt quite as essential. Make no mistake shes excellent in the film as the blue-haired object of the heroines burgeoning desire. But Blue Is The Warmest Color belongs to Exarchopoulos an astoundingly expressive young actress whose face--frequently framed in close-up the better to read every telling minute shift in emotion--becomes the films defining image. She plays a French high-schooler who discovers much to her surprise that she prefers the company of women. Or one woman at least Seydouxs college-age artist whose passing glance on the street a momentous moment of identity-shaking attraction plants the seed for an impending romance. On paper Blue Is The Warmest Color is a fairly ordinary coming-of-age love story stretched like taffy over a three-hour timeframe. In execution it proves to be something more unique. For one Kechiche wastes little of the epic running time. The extra leg room allows for more specificity with the director devoting ample time to Exarchopoulos waning friendships her brief relationship with a boy her seduction by Seydoux and the subsequent affair. (By providing and lingering on details the director rescues his movie from young-love cliche.) Extended classroom scenes which depict the protagonist as a student and then later a teacher provide a kind of elegant Greek-chorus commentary on the films events. The fact that the love story is between two women both is and isnt important; Kechiche doesnt deny the social pressures put on his characters but he also doesnt let that element hijack the narrative. As for the sex scenes theyre as insanely erotic as advertised; its not just their frankness and duration that counts but their emotional intensity too. While many movies treat sex as either sleazy or ""romantically"" mannered heres one that depicts it as a messy sometimes ungraceful act of pure connection. (It helps that Kechiche lays the groundwork with a few sensually charged conversations including the long one in which Exarchopoulos somewhat improbably tracks down her future lover at a lesbian bar.) Blue Is The Warmest Color doesnt quite sustain its dramatic power throughout; the later scenes arent as compelling as the earlier ones perhaps because (minor spoiler alert) the film pays closer attention to how its characters are drawn together than how they drift apart. That said Exarchopoulos carries it through; her features are the canvas on which Kechiche paints this story of lust self-discovery and regret. If everything else I see between now and next Thursday is as good as this I wont beat myself up about only fitting two movies into opening day. Not too much anyway. --A.A.

Movies | Inside Movies Toronto 2013 The Fifth Estate is a feverish tale of cyberjournalism by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Frank Connor) The Fifth Estate Posted September 6 2013 -- 1200 PM EDT The Fifth Estate Bill Condons feverishly edgy and exciting drama about the events surrounding WikiLeaks and its infamous founder the renegade Australian journalist-anarchist Julian Assange is one of the only movies Ive seen that really gets in the rollicking density of its storytelling DNA how the Internet has changed everything. Its easy to see why Condon returning from the Twilight zone to his role as a serious entertainer (Kinsey Gods and Monsters) wanted to make this movie. In form its a vintage journalism thriller a nihilistic newspaper drama for the dark digital age. Assange played by the rising British star Benedict Cumberbatch is a tall slit-eyed hooded creature who presents himself - accurately - as a new kind of information warrior a subversive of the cyber era who will publish anything that exposes fraud corruption violence the sins of corporations and governments. He isnt too discriminating The documents come right at him from anonymous leakers around the globe and apart from his promise to expose those documents to the widest audience imaginable the only service he provides is protecting the whistleblowers. Their identities he assures will be shrouded in the layers of obfuscation made possible by computer technology. Assange palms off WikiLeaks as an ""organization"" but its really just him working with a batch of fake e-mail addresses a single server and a bearded rather courtly young European partner-assistant Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruhl) who helps him man the keyboards. Yet as these two post their unedited secret documents and videos revealing injustice around the world - corruption inside a Swiss bank Police death squads in Kenya The identities of members of the neo-Nazi British National Party A video of two Reuters journalists whose murder was committed and covered up by U.S. troops in Iraq - the film generates a nervous almost manic version of the lets-bring-down-the-kingpins rush of a 70s conspiracy thriller. Condon keeps his camera up close to the actors so that were never cut off from the energy of their mission - or as one might see it from Assanges myopic of-the-moment compulsion to channel any political dirt thats out there. Yet The Fifth Estate is no mindless valorization of Julian Assange. The movie pivots around a vital question When does the unrestricted flow of information begin to destroy everything its out to save? Assange comes on like a journalist but hes a bit like Woodward or Bernstein as a member of the Weather Underground. He pretends its all about justice but its really all about him. Cumberbatch in stringy long white-blonde hair that looks a bit too much like the wig it is does a commanding impersonation of Assanges imperiousness his whole louche Continental narcissism. His Julian is handsome in a scowling way with a pout of aggrievement fixed on his soft pale babyish features and the actor lowers his voice to a slightly slurry bass register as if he were so full of venom that it had depressed him. Yet Assange is also quick-minded and fierce. Hes a real contradiction - a reptilian idealist. His backstory explains everything in a biopic-Freudian way As a boy Julian watched his mother move in with a member of a reactionary Aussie cult and everything hes now doing - his primal loathing of authority - emerges from that upbringing. Hes trying to take down that abusive fake father. Reductive? Perhaps but in my experience the lefties who want to attack everything above them have some pretty basic issues and Assange is a fire-breather who doesnt know when to stop. When an Obama State Department spokesman accuses him of ""terrorism"" it sounds like a defensive government posture but in a sense its accurate. The willingness to expose corruption isnt terrorism but Assange locked in his absolutist war couldnt care less about who he hurts. Hes not just outside the system; hes outside the human connection thats part of what holds the system together. Many of us had never heard of WikiLeaks before its headline-grabbing moment in 2010-2011 when the site - in conjunction with The New York Times The Guardian of London and several other European newspapers - posted war logs from Iraq and Afghanistan along with 250000 U.S. diplomatic cables. The dumping of information was likened by some to the revelations exposed by the Pentagon Papers yet the problem at the time was that the unredacted names posted on WikiLeaks (though not by those mainstream newspapers) could expose innocent informers to death. Assange didnt care He was possessed by bringing down what he saw as the greater evil of institutionalized violence. He was a bit like Noam Chomsky with a cyber weapon He stood on such a high ground that he was effectively above everyone. So how could a character this reckless now be the protagonist of a mainstream movie? What I think a lot of the early negative reaction to The Fifth Estate has missed is that the film is canny enough to present Assange not as a hero but as a highly ambiguous scoundrel-crusader who boldly test-drove - the way Shawn Fanning did with Napster - the new power of the Internet. A number of his scoops were brave and valid and incendiary and would have made any mainstream news organization proud. Yet as the movie goes on its tempered by a sobering awareness that an institution like WikiLeaks represents the fearlessness of great journalism without the accountability. Assange isnt a reporter exactly; hes a conduit - he represents the flip side of the government arrogance hes fighting. The real drama of The Fifth Estate is that it captures how the addictive flow of information exposure now works from the inside out. It gets at whats starting to happen in the world as backroom leakers and rogue reporters despising government surveillance and corruption and control summon a new kind of power to bring those forces down. The Fifth Estate captures the tenor of whistleblowing in the brave new world when the Internet gets turned into a billboard for anyone with the inclination to spill secrets. Call it the anti-social network. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Tags Wikileaks Top Stories J.K.

Bill Condons film about WikiLeaks the free speech haven and/or ""up against the wall motherfker"" activism website (depending on your point of view) is somewhat simpatico with the actions of its leader Julian Assange. Bluntly it does some things right some things wrong and isnt afraid to take an inelegant info dump and dust off its hands. The first hour of ""The Fifth Estate"" blazes by summarizing the major bullet points of what Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch absolutely outstanding here) accomplished prior to the publication of Bradley Mannings Lady Gaga disc of state secrets. He worked for a more democratic process in Africa appeared at hacker conventions and hung around some of the most ridiculously designed high-tech raver squats in movie history. Early on he meets Danny (Daniel Bruhl) something of the Henry Hill in this situation. Danny is seduced by Assanges charm and prophetic style of speech but in time he realizes that the entire WikiLeaks operation is a house of cards. Assange merely talks a good line of b.s. however his underlying thesis - that if technology could create a way for whistleblowers to truly remain anonymous they could topple any institution - starts to catch on. Danny who begins the movie with a job and a love interest quickly finds himself IN TOO DEEP. We learn this because he does a lot of brow-furrowing in front of his computer. (Props to Condon for a movie that devotes a significant amount of its time to watching people type it stays visually expressive.) Assange may be a genius but as is often the case hes a megalomaniac. (Spoiler Alert he dyes his hair that way.) When Danny starts to get some of his own press in Wired Magazine its creates a wedge. During the fun early months of WikiLeaks they were merely taking down banks. But when third world political regimes start taking out vengeance hits the sites determination to post un-edited leaked incriminating documents becomes more serious. By the time Mannings megaupload arrives conference calls on Air Force One begin. ""The Fifth Estate""s screenwriter is one Josh Singer who has some credits from ""The West Wing."" Its surprising because when I was watching Laura Linney State Department character I felt like it was seeing a classic Allison Janney C.J. Cregg scene put through a derpification device. There are at least three times she is condemned to drop dead-weight lines about how ""this is a new kind of battle."" Its kindve embarrassing as is the shoe-horned B-story (really C-story) of Alexander Siddig as the nice guy Middle Eastern man put ""at risk"" by Assanges refusal to take more time to redact Mannings leak. (Dont worry about Siddig - this isnt ""Fair Game."" He ends up fine making his whole section particularly useless.) Im not much of a computer hacker so I cant speak to the verisimilitude of all those black screen laptops and non-user friendly chat clients but I will say that the way hacker culture is presented is an absolute joke. ""The Fifth Estate"" goes out of its way to reinforce every stereotype my 70-year-old mother (who barely knows how to e-mail) has. Pass the energy drink. The best moments come when we see the old school press - namely David Thewlis and Peter Capaldi representing the Guardian - trying to adapt their journalistic ethics to a world with expanded technology. Thewlis gives a very cutting speech about the importance of perception in society. Indeed when more people are talking about the fact that Bradley Manning wants to be called Chelsea rather than the damning evidence he showed the world it is rather telling. Thewlis also gives a speech about the importance of the press traditionally called The Fourth Estate but then talks about this ""new way"" takes a dramatic pause and says ""this Fifth Estate."" So yeah its that kind of movie.

After an opening credits montage that rockets through the history of news media from hand-lettered scrolls to the Internet the pic leaps into the peak October 2010 moment of WikiLeaks fame and notoriety when in tandem with the New York Times the Guardian and Der Spiegel Assange (Benedict Cumberbatch) began releasing an enormous store of leaked classified U.S. government documents. The resulting fracas outshone even prior firestorms incurred by WikiLeaks exposure of the American militarys massacre of unarmed civilians and journalists in Afghanistan; ruling corruption in Kenya and elsewhere; Swiss bank Julius Baer providing a massive tax dodge for wealthy clients around the world; and ugly truths behind Icelands economic collapse. In the fallout as postscripts note Assange remains in hiding (at Ecuadors London embassy) while various angry governments call for his extradition. The remainder of the film tracks back to 2007 when he first makes contact with German technology activist Daniel Domscheit-Berg (Daniel Bruehl) whom he trusts enough to make a close collaborator -- rare for a man whose paranoias are reinforced not only by the dangerous intel he helps make public but by a traumatic Ozzie upbringing within the New Age cult known as the Family (glimpsed in brief flashbacks). Daniel is an enthusiastic acolyte so much so that the 24/7 devotion Julian demands soon exasperates Daniels girlfriend (Alicia Vikander in a standard thankless role). The mysterious seemingly large Wiki organization Assange frequently alludes to turns out to be nothing but ""a website a couple email addresses and you"" he eventually admits though others climb on board -- notably Daniels master-hacker friend Marcus (Moritz Bleibtreu) and Icelandic agitator Birgitta Jonsdottir (Carice van Houten). But even as WikiLeaks appears to be winning the information war in forcing transparency from governments and corporations pushing them toward greater ethical accountability Assange show signs of megalomania instability and questionable judgment. Returning to the screenplays start point his troops rebel when Assange balks at redacting any top-secret American communiques even the parts that might put innocent lives at lethal risk in global hot spots around the globe. Any five minutes of foregrounded human interest or backgrounded news material here could easily float a feature on its own. Both the kindest and most damning thing you can say about ""The Fifth Estate"" is that it primarily hobbles itself by trying to cram in more context-needy material than any single drama should have to bear. You can feel the strain on ""The West Wing"" writer Singer penning his first bigscreen effort as practically every line has to sum up a philosophy situation or dilemma. Likewise Condon usually a director of admirable cogency and restraint lays on a battery of audiovisual tactics (onscreen text graphics split screen vertical wipes etc.) largely set to techno tracks or Carter Burwells equally pounding score. Tobias Schliessers camera often jitters as if on its 10th espresso while Virginia Katzs editing seldom pauses for breath. Theres conceptual logic behind these decisions but they are as frequently off-putting as they are thematically apt. No wonder the two perhaps most memorable scenes are among the very few that slow enough to allow nuance an uncomfortable visit to Daniels parents home when Julian openly disdains them as bourgeois intellectuals; and a lets-just get-drunk moment between Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci as State Dept. honchos whose careers wont likely survive the latest Wiki leaks. An array of fine British European and Middle Eastern actors fill other supporting roles making the most of fleeting opportunities. But for all its flexibility in imagining what might make its real-life characters tick ""The Fifth Estate"" conveys less sense of personal insight into its two main figures than ""We Steal Secrets"" did (and Gibney didnt even have direct access to Assange). German star Bruehl (also co-headlining another big English-language Toronto title ""Rush"") is stuck playing Domscheit-Berg -- who wrote one of the two tomes the script draws on -- as a single-note nice guy the standard audience-alter-ego witness to events that spiral out of control. Hardworking Cumberbatch captures Assanges slightly otherworldly air as well as numerous creepier qualities. (The real-life man may be a hero to many but few claim hes a nice guy.) Still it too feels like a somewhat one-dimensional turn hemmed in by an overall sensibility that just cant stop to probe deeper. Shot in numerous countries the pic has first-rate tech/design elements that are like the project as a whole sometimes too busy for their own good.

Daily Edition Login to download The Fifth Estate Toronto Review 904 PM PDT 9/5/2013 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Benedict Cumberbatchs Julian Assange is the highlight of a sometimes ordinary-feeling film. TWITTER Bill Condons look at WikiLeaks centers on the falling-out between Julian Assange and a key ally. TORONTO -- Whittling the logistical sprawl and moral swamp of WikiLeaks into the story of a falling-out between two intimate partners Bill Condons The Fifth Estate views site founder Julian Assange largely through the eyes of Daniel Domscheit-Berg his German spokesperson in the period leading up to the 2010 release of ""The Iraq War Logs."" Of necessity the film plays less like the directors earlier works involving real-world subjects (Kinsey Gods and Monsters) than like The Social Network. Here again we have an internet phenomenon that has changed the world created by a polarizing psychologically opaque man accused of betraying those around him. The comparison isnt flattering to Estate which though it traffics in life and death and threats to the worlds great institutions isnt always as gripping as a film whose main drama was who would get rich over letting ""friends"" share party pictures. Though it will attract attention at the box office it is unlikely to appeal broadly to moviegoers who one suspects have never been as worked up about WikiLeaks as journalists and governments are. PHOTOS Toronto 21 Hot Festival Titles for Sale The most compelling thing here by far is the films vision of Assange by all accounts a man of enormous self-regard and slippery ethics. Benedict Cumberbatch has the character in hand from the start -- his way of brushing into anothers space and making it his office of not seeing others unless theyre reflecting back some of the energy he emits of elevating himself by making others concerns sound trivial. The actor brings extra ambiguity to scenes in which Assange is ostensibly opening up to people; only once (when activist associates in Kenya are killed) do his emotions seem untainted by manipulative play-acting. When Assange and Daniel Berg (Daniel Bruhl) first meet at a hacker convention the younger man is flattered to have the opportunity to spread awareness of a site he believes in. Bringing Assange to a party house in Berlin he hopes to talk about its operations when his new friend takes things online. The two sit in a quiet corner with laptops open typing chat messages back and forth instead of speaking. Lines from the chat are projected across the actors faces the only really smirk-worthy device Condon uses in a film hoping to animate online activity. Later sequences which use innumerable headlines receding into the distance to show how leaks propagate online are simply uninspired and unable to capture WikiLeakss startling impact visually. PHOTOS Toronto 2013 The Films The film does a more evocative job with the amorphous nature of the sites internal operations visualizing all its hundreds of volunteers -- be they in Internet cafes bedrooms or (as Berg often is) hiding in a supply closet at work -- as connected in a vast virtual office. The rows upon rows of desks may evoke a 1960s steno pool more than a 21st century workplace but the metaphor is useful especially in the dramatic moment when Berg learns that all the other volunteers he has worked with on the site are actually just Assange speaking through different e-mail accounts. Yes though the publisher boasted of a vast army of techies bent on spreading secretsThe Fifth Estate says that for some time Assange and Berg -- and one computer server -- were the entire team. The knowledge generates intense loyalty on Bergs part but hes smart enough to know they need help. Using some savings he buys a stack of servers and stashes them across Europe so they all cant be seized or shut down at once. Berg brings others into the inner circle leading to his first clash with his control-freak partner. Things go seriously bad later as they negotiate with The Guardian and other old media outlets to jointly release troves of military and diplomatic documents leaked by Bradley Manning. (David Thewlis playing veteran reporter Nick Davies embodies the wise bridge between the sensibilities of respectable journalism and indiscriminate revelation.) Though Assange covets the boost in exposure this publication will bring Berg is shocked to find that he doesnt intend to honor his promise to redact names and other identifying information from the highly-sensitive cables. The film intends this conflict to stir debate over the degrees of secrecy that are required in free societies but it comes across more as a clash of personalities. The film sides with Berg whose brand of idealism is less concerned with dramatic attention-getting gestures than with producing a righteous result. STORY Bill Condons Political Julian Assange Drama Fifth Estate Opens Toronto Fest Showing the far other side of the coin Estate offers some composite characters in the U.S. State Department (played by Laura Linney and Stanley Tucci) who must try to squash leaks and scramble to protect operatives about to be exposed. This side of the film feels perfunctory and while some tension is generated by a sequence following a Libyan source trying to evade arrest the scenes dont add much to Berg and Assanges impassioned debates over the value of secret operatives lives versus those of the civilians killed in the wars they wage.

Living in Londons Ecuadorian Embassy since last June to avoid extradition charges Assange still runs the underground organization WikiLeaks role. His persistence  either testifies to his fierce principles or brash egotism depending on where you fall on the issue. WikiLeaks decision to publish previously anonymous sources among the millions of files on the U.S. war in Afghanistan all of which were leaked by the recently sentenced ex-soldier Chelsea Manning have positioned the understandings of Assanges operation somewhere between recklessness and unbridled activism. With so many factors in play and Assanges fate still developing the idea of an Assange biopic might seem premature. But thats the least problematic issue plaguing Bill Condons ""The Fifth Estate"" an uneven intermittently thoughtful but largely preachy overview of WikiLeaks rising influence that has less of an issue determining Assanges character than it does with telling a compelling story. With rising star Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role buried under long blond hair and a thick Australian accent ""The Fifth Estate"" gets one thing right The actor looks and talks the part with a jittery intensity comparable to Jessie Eisenbergs similarly passionate techie in David Finchers ""The Social Network."" Unlike Finchers eloquent approach however ""The Fifth Estate"" has none of the observational insight found in Aaron Sorkins wry script; instead Condons take messily oscillates between ham-fisted ideological sermons and the ingredients of a cyber thriller. Unsurprisingly given the erratic nature of the material Josh Singers screenplay draws from two different books about the subject. ""WikiLeaks Inside Julian Assanges War on Secrecy"" provides a researched history of the site but ""Inside WikiLeaks My Time with Julian Assange at the Worlds Most Dangerous Website"" was written by former Assange colleague Daniel Domscheit-Berg played by Daniel Brul in ""The Fifth Estate"" in a continually flustered state as he flails about in Assanges shadow. It doesnt take long to relate to his conundrum. Too self-serious to play like satire the broad drama of ""The Fifth Estate"" seems at once to deride Assange for carelessly putting his principles ahead of others security and to relish the technological fetishes of his world From the very beginning the movie is peppered with basic CGI graphics to elaborate on the viral element of his cause. With a swirling globe covered in streaming lines from one country to another Condon signifies the unstoppable surge of WikiLeaks influence. As Assange and Berg obsessively tap out code and engage with clandestine sources across a secure server Condon regularly cuts to images of them working in an impossible beachside outdoor office space a feeble attempt to figuratively represent the untethered possibilities of the web. As much as it tries to justify the overreaching visuals ""The Fifth Estate"" cant match the grandiosity with its plot specifics. Starting in 2007 when longtime cyberpunk Assange recruits Berg to his cause the movie finds the character lost in the vain pursuit of radical activism that routinely falls on deaf ears. His situation changes overnight when the duo comes across documents detailing the corrupt antics of Swiss bank Julius Baer and sends them out into the ether instantly putting WikiLeaks on the map. ""Hes bigger than the Times"" asserts one befuddled journalist contemplating the ramifications of Assanges power. Hes so big in fact that ""The Fifth Estate"" cant figure out how to fit his outsized personality into the story without repeatedly simplifying it. Even Domscheit-Berg Assanges ostensible partner-in-crime falls victim to his influence -- a situation thinly demonstrated with a perfunctory subplot that finds Assange getting in the way of Bergs relationship with his new girlfriend (Alicia Vikander). ""Youll never be like him"" she says to his dismay. But only Assange can convince him. WikiLeaks second in command finally thinks twice about his allegiances when Assange turns on Berg after he disagrees with Assanges decision to release the names of confidential government sources overseas. These events take place with the elementary quality of browsing Assanges own Wikipedia page. Neither emotionally involving or believable like WikiLeaks theyre mainly concerned with the basic facts. Even the occasional stabs at exploring Assanges curious backstory including his childhood in an eccentric cult and an estranged teenage offspring suffer from the bluntness of bullet points. The movie sometimes works fine on that level by providing a meaty debate on the boundaries of free speech but the lackluster treatment of Assanges persona prevents the movie from sublimating its ideas into the main narrative. The overstatement surrounding Assanges significance looks particularly crass when viewed in contrast to a compelling side plot involving frantic U.S. defense secretary Sarah Shaw (Laura Linney) who battles to protect one of her sources against the revelations of the Manning documents. Linney speaking in a witty staccato thats the closest the movie comes to echoing Sorkin-level vitality brings a clarity to the unprecedented sense of unease generated by Assanges work. By contrast other scenes strain from contrived circumstances that reflect the very type of artificiality WikiLeaks was designed to dismantle. Condon a proficient filmmaker whose screenplays for ""Gods and Monsters"" as well as ""Kinsey"" demonstrated a capacity for smart biographical storytelling seems incapable of grappling with Assanges slippery nature. By the end Assange has virtually hacked the project When Cumberbatch speaks out in character against the production of the movie ""The Fifth Estate"" winds up its own worst critic. Criticwire grade C HOW WILL IT PLAY? DreamWorks releases ""The Fifth Estate"" in October.
