Its hard to quite put your finger on the secret of his appeal but its there. And the former King of Queens Kevin James puts his underdog charm to full use in the Happy Madison production he co-wrote and stars in Paul Blart Mall Cop. Its the com-rom (more comedy than romance) tale of the trials and bumbling triumphs of portly pushover Paul Blart a hypoglycemic security guard at a New Jersey shopping center. If he doesnt get his pixie stick fix or other sugary jolt every few hours hell slip into unconsciousness -- like when he passed out snoring a few inches from the finish line for the police academy field exam. Proudly patrolling the shops on his regulation Segway Blart doesnt get much respect -- not from the uncooperative scooter-wandering senior he tries to cite for reckless driving nor from the burly female fighting for the last Victoria Secret push-up bra in her size. Yet he seems mostly content with his circumstances if not for one crucial missing piece. He longs for a special lady love. And then he spots her Amy a blond vision working at a wig kiosk. As is clear from the films start Blart is not a fellow to whom success comes naturally or even gracefully. And his romantic endeavors are no different. But then fate throws Paul a bone (and a chance to be a hero) when a team of acrobatic outlaws take over the mall and hold Amy and some customers hostage in a mall bank. In spirit its a little Theres Something About Mary meets Die Hard with Kevin James rather than a zany ensemble as the comic cornerstone on whose wide shoulders the movies sense of humor rests. Without him Mall Cop wouldnt work at all and definitely wouldnt be funny. With him the movie has its hilarious moments -- fueled more by slapstick and sight gags than witty repartee. Chuckle-worthy highlights include a starry-eyed hair-blowing Segway ride for two to the tune of Survivors ""I Cant Hold Back"" and a drunken maniac-on-the-dance-floor mall cop unleashed at American Joes bar. Other than the appropriately sweet and alluring Amy (Jayma Mays) and Blarts wise-beyond-her years daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) the only memorable performances may be those of the gang of thieves who besiege the mall. Not because of their acting but because of their ninja-like extreme sport maneuvers. An airborne criminal on a skateboard crashing into a glass elevator another leaping like a cat from one floor to the next -- regardless of the scripts intent its an odd unnecessary distraction. In general the bad guys dont make sense even by the Mall Cop universes own rules. Theyre armed and deadly but despite their murderous threats they repeatedly spare the life of the one man in their way. In places the plot sags a bit and some jokes dont quite hit their mark or tickle the funny bone as much as theyre obviously meant to. In the end though not necessarily a consistently great comedy Paul Blart Mall Cop is a little like pie or peanut butter -- not entirely satisfying but still a guilty pleasure that as Paul says ""fills the cracks of the heart"" at least for a few moments.

ABOUT THE MOVIEPaul Blart Mall Cop1/2 out of four Stars Kevin James Keir ODonnell Jayma Mays Raini Rodriguez Bobby Cannavale Shirley KnightDirector Steve CarrDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG for some violence mild crude and suggestive humor and languageRunning time 1 hour 27 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Those who like a well-worn fat joke or 12 may be amused by Paul Blart Mall Cop. All others can steer clear of the obnoxious and laugh-free antics of this overzealous misfit security guard and his mall rat compatriots. The last name Blart may be the funniest thing in the movie so thats a hint as to just how bad this shopping-center saga can be. Blart (Kevin James) is a single dad living with his well-meaning mother (Shirley Knight) and loving daughter (Raini Rodriguez). They are kinder to him than he deserves. Hes a massively annoying character. On top of being a sad sack he is both officious and inept. He attended the police academy but blacked out during an all-important exercise. He has low blood sugar which is why he always has to eat candy a recurring joke that doesnt get any funnier with repetition. After failing the state trooper exam repeatedly he brings his full arsenal of law enforcement tactics to his security job at a sprawling mall. He rides around on his Segway as if it was a police motorcycle ostensibly keeping the peace but mostly meddling and doing busy work. While keeping the mall safe for shopaholics everywhere he spots Amy (Jayma Mays) and is instantly smitten. She sells hair extensions in a kiosk and he works hard to impress her with his knowledge of useless trivia a gag that grows tired fast. When a band of thieves invades the mall takes hostages and undertakes a heist Blart springs into action. Well he doesnt so much spring as bumble and waddle. In contrast the felonious intruders are a nimble bunch of cool customers. Some appear straight from competing in the X Games zipping around on skateboards and bikes as they do their evil deeds. Others leap and flip so acrobatically they could be on a break from Cirque du Soleil. But somehow the blubbery Blart manages to foil them all. The ringleader is a bland villain named Veck (Keir ODonnell). For a movie thats essentially a 90-minute fat joke Paul Blart Mall Cop is surprisingly lean when it comes to laughs.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 16 2009 Paul Blart Mall Cop (out of 4)Starring Kevin James Jayma Mays Keir ODonnell Raini Rodriguez and Shirley Knight. Directed by Steve Carr. 87 minutes. At major theatres. PG Kevin James from TVs King of Queens works his lovable loser schtick like a pooch with a pork chop in Paul Blart Mall Cop a comedy about a chubby enforcer who stumbles upon a terrorist takeover of his New Jersey retail complex.And you may well ask Isnt it a little late to be doing a Die Hard parody?Indeed about 20 years too late to be sure. If youre the kind of person who worries about such things then this pictures modest charms directed without distinction by Steve Carr (Daddy Day Care) will likely elude you.James who also co-wrote and produced the film knows his limits and how best to make them funny. His Blart is no Bruce Willis by about 50 pounds which is what youd expect of a guy who spreads peanut butter on his pie to ""fill in the cracks.""Blart also suffers from hypoglycemia a blood sugar disorder that requires frequent licks on lollipops to prevent him from blacking out.Hes perfectly pathetic in other words. But hes determined to do the best job he can protecting his mall as he scoots past the Cinnabons and Starbucks on his ridiculous Segway shaking down miscreants in strollers and wheelchairs.""Nobody knows this mall better than I do"" Blart says not realizing that nobody wants to know this mall as well as he does.A single dad to pre-teen daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez) and forced to live with his mom Blart has to bring home the bacon somehow. Hes happy to live small dreaming of one day making it with fellow mall drone Amy (Jayma Mays). But then a band of terrorists working some kind of Dr. Evil plan to fleece mall merchants by collecting their cash register PINs - wouldnt it be easier to just knock over a bank? - accidentally lock him into their larceny and all heck breaks loose.They forgot one thing. They forgot they were dealing with Paul Blart Mall Cop. Sorry thats a Rambo reference and this is very much a Die Hard yuk. And its surprisingly okay in a January kind of way. That mom whom Blart lives with? Played by Shirley Knight who was the gorgeous blonde opposite Paul Newman in Sweet Bird of Youth in 1962 a lifetime ago.

"Paul Blart Mall Cop reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Paul Blart Mall Cop reviewed. Paul Blart Mall Cop reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 16 2009 1129 AM Paul Blart Mall Cop Just a fat guy and an empty mall. By Dana Stevens Kevin James as Paul Blart Two years ago in a fit of idiocy I forgot my laptop on a bench in the Time Warner Center Midtown Manhattans high-rise mall. Half an hour and several hundred muttered obscenities later I rushed back to the bench from which the computer had of course disappeared. The rest of the afternoon was spent in the company of one of the coolest individuals that Ive ever met a former NYPD homicide cop whod recently given up the streets for a safer and more lucrative gig in retail security. We reviewed surveillance-camera footage together as we chatted about the family circumstances that had sparked his career change. I never figured out who took my iBook but I left the mall with the business card of one righteous dude--and the sense that unless youre an unattended electronic device the Time Warner Center is safe as houses. That experience has practically nothing to do with Paul Blart Mall Cop (Columbia Pictures) a new comedy about the joys and perils of mall security. Poor Officer Blart (The King of Queens Kevin James who also co-wrote and co-produced) possesses neither the policing chops nor the macho resume of the Time Warner Centers security chief. Blart a roly-poly loser who failed the exit exam at the New Jersey police academy lives with his mother (Shirley Knight) and daughter (Raini Rodriguez) and spends his days patrolling the West Orange mall on a Segway-like personal transporter. A stolen laptop would make Blarts year--most days hes reduced to chasing down retirees who roll too fast in their wheelchairs. Blarts weight and low self-esteem have kept him from seeking out the love he longs for. (""Food fills the cracks in the heart"" he counsels his daughter slathering peanut butter on his blueberry pie. ""Go away pain."") Advertisement Its a good thing Paul Blart is such an endearing character because the movie takes a half-hour to get going. Blart pompously mentors a rookie guard (Keir ODonnell channeling Heathers-era Christian Slater to good effect) and clumsily courts Amy (Jayma Mays) proprietress of the malls ""Unbeweaveable"" wig kiosk. At the end of one slow shift he kills time playing Guitar Hero at the gaming arcade--unaware that a crack team of thieves has taken over the mall and that Amy is among their hostages From there on in Paul BlartMall Cop becomes a soft-hearted (and occasionally soft-headed) spoof of Die Hard with Blart as the NJPDs ""man on the inside"" using whatever he can find around the mall to thwart the absurdly athletic baddies (some of them know parkour or martial arts; others race through the mall on skateboards). The climactic chase sequence has two or three really good sight gags none of which Ill spoil here--this movie has few jokes to spare. As Will Arnett proved in Arrested Development a self-serious man riding a Segway is funny in itself even if Mall Cop milks that joke a bit dry. The best stunts take advantage of Kevin James rubbery bulk his startling agility and his Weeble-like way of righting himself after bouncing off an immovable object. (Its a telling and depressing commentary on gender bias that the movies only really mean fat joke takes place at a womans expense when Blart subdues a hefty female customer at Victorias Secret.) Variety calls Mall Cop ""almost shockingly amateurish"" (and notes correctly that the plot continuity and coherence are as slipshod as Paul Blarts policing skills) but I submit that the movies homegrown Americas Funniest  Home Videos quality is one of its strengths. Sure this is the kind of cheapo lark that gets dumped on the market in January when nobodys expecting much. But as cheapo larks go its a winningly unassuming one no stars no big action set pieces. Just a fat guy a near-empty mall and a lot of really ridiculous ideas. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

In this image released by Sony Pictures Kevin James is shown in the comedy ""Paul Blart Mall Cop."" Photo Richard Cartwright AP Movie review Paul Blart Mall Cop 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Paul Blart Mall Cop Comedy. Starring Kevin James Jayma Mays Keir ODonnell and Shirley Knight. Directed by Steve Carr. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Remember just a few years ago when the Segway Personal Transporter was going to reinvent the way we design our cities and live our lives? The upright scooter has officially replaced the AMC Gremlin as Hollywoods No. 1 go-to sight gag. And its pretty much the only punch line in ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" the latest vehicle for comedian Kevin James to make a few dozen more self-deprecating jokes about his weight. Playing the lonely-but-upbeat security guard Paul Blart James seems to be going for the same sad-sack vibe that John Candy achieved two decades ago in ""Planes Trains and Automobiles"" but he ends up closer to Robin Williams character in ""One Hour Photo."" His attempts to woo a comely seller of hair extensions played by Jayma Mays are particularly creepy as his courtship mostly consists of stalking the poor woman. Not since ""Seinfeld"" was on the air has a movie or TV show done more to promote the fantasy that hot women are really looking for schlubby guys with bad jobs and unbearable personalities. ""Blart"" gets slightly better once the bad guys arrive in the form of tattooed thugs who ride skateboards and practice parkour as they run and jump through the mall. They barricade the doors take hostages and execute a plan that seems to involve collecting credit card numbers. (Wouldnt it be easier to just root through a few trash cans?) From there its just like ""Die Hard"" except with less bloodshed and more obesity jokes. The action sequences are just as ridiculous as the romance parts but at least James seems comfortable with the pratfalls and gross-out scenarios. A scene where the hypoglycemic Blart must decide whether to eat a lollipop covered with garbage is funny. Another sequence where Blart must fight the bad guys Viet Cong-style in a Rainforest Cafe shows what this comedy could have been. But its amazing at times how little fun the makers of ""Paul Blart"" have with the suburban mall setting which seems as if it should be filled with comedic opportunities. Hot Dog on a Stick by itself should be good for three or four laughs even in the hands of an inferior screenwriter. All the mall in this movie does is make you think how much you would rather be watching ""Dawn of the Dead"" or ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" ""Paul Blart"" is one of those films that Adam Sandler produces but doesnt appear in. Its similar to ""Grandmas Boy"" and ""The Benchwarmers"" which feature Sandler-style humor on a much smaller budget. I suppose the food equivalent would be that nacho cheese that comes in a can with little chunks of jalapeno mixed in. In the defense of ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" the movie is rated PG and clearly aimed to appeal to crowds that might be too young or prudish for ""Role Models"" or ""Tropic Thunder."" This is a film for people who miss the family-friendly and plot-thin slapstick of the ""Home Alone"" sequels and it does deliver a few cheap laughs. Its pretty hard not to laugh when a Segway PT smashes into the back of a minivan. -- AdvisoryThis movie contains mild crude and sexual language violence and actor Peter Gerety who deserves better. We really need to start a good-actor bailout fund so people who were on ""The Wire"" and ""The Sopranos"" dont have to appear in Doritos commercials and bad Kevin James films.

"Paul Blart Mall Cop | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paul-blart-mall-cop ) Paul Blart Mall Cop (United States 2009) A movie review by James Berardinelli After stumbling through a lackluster first 30 minutes that features all the tepid humor one might reasonably expect from a mediocre comedy Paul Blart Mall Cop does something unexpected it becomes watchable perhaps even passably enjoyable. Thats because this movie elevates its objective from lampooning mall security guards to satirizing one of Hollywoods biggest genres the action/crime movie. In particular Die Hard. To be sure the iconic 1988 Bruce Willis film has been the subject of numerous big-screen parodies during the past two decades but none has succeeded as well as this one. Considering the dubious quality of many of them that could be considered damning with faint praise. And although Paul Blart is by no means great cinema there is amusement to be uncovered as we watch Kevin James bumble his way through actions oh-so-similar to those navigated with more blood sweat profanity and dead bodies than Willis. Too bad theres no ""Yippekayay..."" but this is rated PG. Paul Blart (Kevin James) is a rent-a-cop at a North Jersey mall. He doesnt get to carry a gun but he has a Segway to ride around on. Pauls ultimate dream is to join the New Jersey State police force but hypoglycemia has thus far prevented him from completing the physically draining entrance exam. Theres another point of dissatisfaction in Pauls life hes lonely and dreams of finding Ms. Right even though the on-line dating service in which his daughter (Raini Rodriguez) has enrolled him keeps telling him ""You have no matches."" Paul has his eye on Amy (Jayma Mays) the operator of a new kiosk at the mall but he lacks the gumption to approach her. Meanwhile he has the task of training a new security guard Veck (Keir ODonnell) whos only on duty because he couldnt get accepted for any other job. On Black Friday however Pauls life undergoes a radical change when terrorists take over the mall locking the police out. The only one in a position to help the hostages and apprehend the bad guys is Paul. I admit to having looked at my watch a few too many times during the movies prolonged opening act as we ""get to know"" Paul. Like most one-dimensional comedy protagonists hes not really worth spending so much introductory time with. The scenes of him going about his daily mall patrol duties while arguably necessary to the setup are rather dull. Kevin James imbues Paul with more likeability than we would get from say Adam Sandler but its a generic role. The film takes off however when it gets to the Die Hard stuff. This is actually a pretty clever way to rework the basic scenario of John McClane trapped on his own with a group of terrorists in a building. Paul Blart Mall Cop refers either directly or indirectly to Die Hard numerous times (I can see a drinking game herea|) and its amusing to recognize how minimal tweaks can convert thrills into laughs. The PG rating assures that the violence will be limited and cartoonish. Theres a nod to this when Paul apparently injured peels back his shirtsleeve to reveal a tiny cut (upon which he places a childish band-aid). Would the film have been funnier had it been more graphic? Perhaps but the essential innocence of the proceedings defuses anything resembling tension. Those who enjoy Paul Blart Mall Cop will be watching purely for its comedic and satiric value not because theres any inherent interest in how the storylines will be resolved. Kevin James possesses the Teddy Bear factor that served John Candy well. Like Candy James is a big man and plays characters with big hearts. Hes a refreshing change from the Sandlers and Carreys who have dominated motion picture comedies with their often mean-spirited antics over the past 1 1/2 decades. And unlike Will Ferrell James isnt in a perpetual state of arrested adolescence. Hes a regular guy. Thats his charm. Here hes a schlub who deserves more out of life but takes pride in the lowliest of jobs being a mall security job. The term ""loveable loser"" was coined for this sort of individual. Im not going to claim that Paul Blart Mall Cop deserves placement on anyones movie schedule ahead of the many fine Oscar bait films against which it is competing. Its a juvenile motion picture designed primarily for a juvenile audience. But theres a little more here than one might reasonably expect and that makes it a passable choice for watching at home when viewers tend to be less demanding. Certainly the question of what Die Hard would have been like in a suburban mall with Kevin James as the hero offers the potential of a diverting 90 minutes. To the extent that this is Paul Blart Mall Cops goal it cant be said to have failed.

He also falls on his bottom. Laughs occasionally ensue. Blart white of shirt and spherical of build is overly proud of his job patrolling a New Jersey shopping mall as if it were the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The only law-enforcement official who wields less authority is a hall monitor. The guy would need to undergo rigorous training to make it as a meter maid. Pop Video Quiz Comedy Duos He flirts up a Lohan-ish redhead (Jayma Mays) who sells hair extensions from a kiosk and drives his two-wheeled ride as proudly as Erik Estrada ever could although Blarts vehicle is a Segway. (You gotta hand it to the guy who invented the little nerd carrier It did indeed turn out to be a massive breakthrough in comedy if not transportation.) Blart is a lonely man who lives with his mother and the two children left him by his immigrant wife who turned out to be more interested in citizenship than romance. He is not without solace ""Pie"" he declares. ""It really helps heal."" Especially when swathed in peanut butter. ""It just fills the cracks of the heart."" For a half-hour or so Blart blurts and blunders and bumbles his way through the mall getting drunk and fighting with even fatter people one of them a lady. The physical comedy isnt bad but its a little ragged as is the movies habit of busting out an 80s monster rock ballad whenever its stuck. Heard it from a friend who heard it from a friend who heard it from another that this gag is dead. Criminals invade the building take Blarts not-quite-girlfriend hostage and maam it sure does look like weve got an action thriller on our hands. Its ""Die Hard With a Man Bosom."" The baddies are a team of BMX riders/skateboarders/computer hackers who zip around the mall like hipster ninjas being outsmarted by Blart as their mastermind (Keir ODonnell the gay son who was sweet on Vince Vaughn in ""Wedding Crashers"") tries to pinch the entire malls credit card receipts on Black Friday. (The movie set in West Orange NJ was actually filmed at a mall outside Boston. They couldnt find a mall in New Jersey?) The plot makes no sense although it makes more sense than the last ""Die Hard"" movie. Its fine for kids though and it doesnt try too hard. Blart the human Cinnabon tries to be arrogant but fails. He knows why people remember him. ""Remember me?"" says the captain of a SWAT team that rushes to the scene. ""I set you on fire at the pancake festival."" James looks like he was put together at the Build-a-Bear Workshop and his sweaty innocence almost makes you think of John Candy. His character wears a Hello Kitty bandage on his boo-boo and stops in the middle of a hostage situation to pick out a birthday card. But James isnt quite as sweet as Candy. Big as he is he isnt big enough to star on the big screen although sidekickery and best-buddyism should keep him employed for years. If Im wrong I can think of other movies I dread more than ""Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 Escape from Sunglass Hut."" PAUL BLART MALL COP King of Krispy Kremes. Running time 87 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor profanity some violence). At the Kips Bay the Orpheum the Lincoln Square others.

(Columbia Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday January 15 2009 628 PM Comedy about a guard who foils a mall robbery. With Kevin James. Director Steve Carr (130). PG Violence crude humor language. At area theaters.Wouldnt you like to be in Adam Sandlers circle? The most loyal guy in Hollywood Sandler seems to have started his Happy Madison production company primarily to employ buddies like Rob Schneider David Spade and now Kevin James.Perfectly inoffensive and almost entirely unfunny ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" is more of a numbing experience than a painful one. Which if nothing else makes it a step up from the worst Happy Madison movies. (Although even ""Deuce Bigalow Canadian Gigolo"" would be a step up from the worst Happy Madison movies.) Its only fair to give some credit to James who carries the entire movie on his hefty shoulders. Hes not exactly a laugh riot but he is at least likable as the hapless Blart security guard at a generic shopping mall. James may once have been the king of Queens but Blart is a New Jersey joker. He lives with his mom (Shirley Knight) his wife skipped town the day she got her green card and he has just failed the state trooper exam. Again. When the mall is taken over by thieves a few hostages are captured and everyone else runs out in a panic. Blart tries to flee but when he discovers that both his daughter (Raini Rodriguez) and his crush (Jayma Mays) are among the hostages he stays behind to play hero. This could be his one chance to turn his life around while saving the two people who mean the most to him. What ensues is the kind of filler you might find in any low-level comedy Blart outruns the gang on his Segway. Blart beats up the bad guys with equipment from the sporting goods store. And yes Blart tries to hide in the vents but is so fat he falls through the ceiling. Unfortunately those uninspired moments are the most amusing ones in the whole film. Which means I either just ruined the experience for you or did you a very big favor. Unless you happen to be friends with Sandler yourself itd be safe to assume the latter.

Granted there is plenty that should make ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" starring Kevin James just another manufactured comedy headed for a predictable ending and decent box-office numbers. For instance set right before Black Friday the timing seems off. Visually the film looks tackier than any of the stores in the New Jersey mall where James security guard -- er ""officer"" -- serves and protects. Then theres the matter of a very familiar setup. A group of slick criminals takes over the mall skateboarding and BMXing their way through the stores and corridors as they go about their well-conceived heist. Veck the arrogant mastermind (Keir ODonnell) has devised a foolproof plan. Unless that fool is Paul Blart and youre holding hostage the woman he has a crush on. Yes ""Mall Cop"" recasts ""Die Hard"" putting a bumbler where John McClane once ruled. Bobby Cannavale barges into the hostage situation a SWAT blowhard. Theres even a jerk of a co-worker. This one is a pen salesman who hits on Blarts crush Amy. Jayma Mays doesnt quite hold her own next to James which is too bad. Its not a good thing for audiences to believe too early that Amy should count herself lucky to be the object of Blarts lovesick glances. In spite of these quibbles ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" is surprisingly winning. Which has us wondering What is it about James exactly? (If you know please write us.) Watching the actor do his shtick conjures warm memories of afternoons spent with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello flicks on pre-cable TV. James is all Costello but with something unexpected and gently exploited a goofy sex appeal. Audiences first bought into this during James hit TV sitcom ""King of Queens."" In his big-screen debut ""Hitch"" he made the Will Smith rom-com more human. Sure it was hard to believe hed get the girl played by supermodel Amber Valletta. But the movie and the comic used their magic well in transforming a shy guys low self-esteem. Blart has his own share of confidence issues. Hes been a security guard for 10 years when he really hoped to become a state trooper. The single father has been girlfriend-less nearly as long. He has yet to regulate his sugar intake and has hypoglycemia dips. Pixy Stix stat Two more reasons for the movies heart are Shirley Knight and Raini Rodriquez who play Blarts mother and daughter. While mom may be an enabler daughter Maya acts as the wise nurturer of her bone-headed lonesome dad. Credit screenwriters James and Nick Bakay for mining the kookiness of the Segway. The perpendicular two-wheeled ""Personal Transporter"" is a picture-perfect choice for the kind of law enforcement requiring a security guard to chase down a senior speeding on a scooter. James has a swell time making balletic hay with the vehicle. ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" PG for some violence mild crude and suggestive humor and language. 1 hour 27 minutes. Directed by Steve Carr; written by Kevin James and Nick Bakay; photography by Russ T. Alsobrook; starring Kevin James Jayma Mays Keir ODonnell Bobby Cannavale Stephen Rannazzisi and Shirley Knight.

"Mall Cop Segways into silliness - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Paul Blart Mall Cop Segway-ing into silliness Kevin James is the co-writer and star of Paul Blart Mall Cop. (Richard cartwright) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / January 16 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The prediction in ""WALL-E"" of a human race turned to spineless dumplings comes depressingly true in ""Paul Blart Mall Cop."" As played by Kevin James Paul doesnt appear to have any idea what his body can do or cant. He seems much more competent at work riding a Segway personal transport thingamajig than he does walking on his own two feet.For the machine James has devised some nice physical choreography. Stuffed in a snug security guards uniform his tubby body becomes a vision of weightlessness aboard the Segway pirouetting around corners and glissading down hallways. But the pleasures of such sights are momentary since the movie set at a New Jersey shopping center (but filmed at the Burlington Mall) turns from live-action Pixar to a particularly inept Looney Toon.Paul pities himself overeats lives with his mother (Shirley Knight) and daughter (Raini Rodriguez) and desperately wants to date the bland girl (Jayma Mays) who runs the wig cart outside Zales. When acrobatic skate-thugs descend on the mall after hours and take hostages Paul gets to play the hero. James co-wrote the movie (Steve Carr has barely directed it) and you can see how someone very bored and with a little showbiz clout might have an idea to cross ""Marty"" with ""Die Hard.""But you also have to wonder whether the nacho-eating contests with a man twice his girth were Jamess idea or why he thought a scene with him stuck in an air vent with a growling stomach would bring down the house. (Actually the night I watched this movie that scene did bring down the house.)Elsewhere hypoglycemia hot sauce Bobby Cannavale as a SWAT commander and a climax at the Rainforest Cafe are put to execrable comic ends. The film itself meanwhile looks like something stubbed out in an ashtray. Its unlikely that even WALL-E could bring himself to scoop up this movie and leave it on his post-apocalyptic junk heap.

Please. We beg you. These films do not warrant even your short attention spans. January 15 2009 -- 630pm Jaimie Trueblood Associated Press In this image released by Dreamworks Pictures Emma Roberts left and Jake T. Austin are shown in a scene from ""Hotel for Dogs."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Hotel for Dogs  out of four stars Rating PG for brief mild thematic elements language and some crude humor. If you can excuse the repetitive doggy-doo-doo gags and awkward teen romances you might find some meaningful lessons about opportunism in the face of abandonment in ""Hotel for Dogs"" the vacant Nickelodeon-produced adaptation of the 1971 Lois Duncan novel of the same name. Otherwise youd probably be just as entertained chasing your own tail. Andi (Emma Roberts niece of Julia) and Bruce (Jake T. Austin) are orphaned siblings who turn an abandoned hotel into a day spa for stray dogs many of which they bust out of a Gitmo-inspired animal shelter. Canine enthusiasts and those under age 10 will lap up the sight of dozens of dogs making adorable faces and ""acting"" in unison but even they will have to suffer through a bland plot and dreadful acting (save for Don Cheadles welcome appearances). True to life this dog of a movie is only fun when its behaving itself. (Daniel Getahun) Paul Blart Mall Cop  1/2 out of four stars Rating PG for some violence mild crude and suggestive humor and language. Ten steps to making a senseless Hollywood comedy 1) Write a formulaic carbon paper-thin screenplay and give it an even emptier title like ""Paul Blart Mall Cop."" 2) Carefully time the humor one joke every six minutes. 3) Hire Steve Carr (""Are We Done Yet?"") to direct the movie. 4) Cast a popular TV star (Kevin James ""The King of Queens"") to play a lovable loser-turned-hero -- in this case a mall security guard who takes his job so seriously that he creates his own oath of service upon which he calls when hooligans lay siege to the mall. 5) Also cast an impossibly cute blonde as his one-dimensional love interest and a terrific character actor (Bobby Cannavale) desperately seeking a quick paycheck. 6) Secure key scenes of star crashing a Segway into things. 7) Ensure that a romantic ending is foreshadowed before the 10-minute mark. 8) For more slapstick continue filming Segway gags right into the ground -- hard. 9) Release film at suburban malls give moviegoers glimmer of hope that capable stars will find better opportunities in the future. 10) Following brief theater run package for in-flight entertainment and DVD bargain bins. (Daniel Getahun) Chandni Chowk to China  out of four stars Not rated but appropriate for any age. Theater Brookdale 8. ""Chandni Chowk to China"" supposedly is the ""the first-ever Bollywood kung-fu comedy"" which makes me pray fervently that it will also be the last. ""CC2C"" (as its being called) is a Frankensteins monster of a film that references everything from ""Kill Bill"" to ""Goldfinger"" other Indian musicals Warner Brothers cartoons of the 1940s and many others. The insufferable Akshay Kumar stars as Sidhu a buffoonish cook from the Delhi market neighborhood of Chandni Chowk. A poor villager in China believes Sidhu is the reincarnation of an ancient warrior and brings him to China to fight an evil smuggler. Little does Sidhu know that he will lose his adopted father fall in love reunite lost twins and well theres more tons more but it would take a whole page of this newspaper to sum it up and its not worth the ink. If youre hungry for a good Bollywood musical go to your local Indian market and ask for a DVD recommendation. Unfunny baffling and exhausting ""Chandni Chowk to China"" should be avoided.

Starring Kevin James Keir ODonnell Jayma Mays Director Steve Carr Running time 131  Editorial Review Here is one good thing I can say about ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" Even though it was co-produced by Adam Sandler it never sinks to scatological humor.Thats pretty much where the accolades end for this mediocre unmemorable comedy one with such obviously humble intentions that busting on it is a bit like harassing the junior high school outcast who just wants to eat his tater tots in peace. ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" never hurt anyone. Why cant I leave it alone?Because I just cant at least not until I provide the requisite plot summary. Kevin James plays an overweight mall security officer named Paul Blart. With few friends and wicked case of hypoglycemia our hero has a heart of gold. He is a simple man devoted to the teenage daughter he raises as a single dad; the proprietress of the malls hair extension kiosk; and the safety of the patrons who frequent Bath amp; Body Works and Limited Too.On a particularly unfortunate Black Friday a posse of thieves assumes control of the mall and starts to take hostages. Will the man who cant even break up a catfight at Victorias Secret step up when it really counts?James gamely pratfalls and stumbles through all 90 minutes of these proceedings but his clumsy somersaults and silly Segway maneuvers elicit few giggles. More intriguing is Raini Rodriguez a 15-year-old actress who conveys a believable sweetness as Blarts daughter and with luck will score a better part in a better movie someday.Bottom line If I were home sick and came across ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" on cable then discovered that the remote was wayyy on the other side of the room I could lie on the couch and watch the entire thing without being unhappy. But under normal circumstances when there are so many other films to see why bother?-- Jen Chaney (Jan. 16 2009)Contains violence mildly crude and suggestive humor and language.

Perks include supporting roles and screenwriting credits in his films access to his Scrooge McDuck-style money vault and famous abundance of silly voices and for a lucky few a Sandler-produced vehicle courtesy of his Happy Madison production company. Kevin James has much more going for him than most Sandler cronies a stand-up career a long-running sitcom (King Of Queens) and a co-lead in Sandlers I Now Pronounce You Chuck And Larry for starters. But with Paul Blart Mall Cop James has been given the same kind of ramshackle half-assed vehicle Happy Madison previously lavished on the likes of Allen Covert (who co-stars here) and David Spade. James who also co-wrote the script (no doubt with an uncredited polish by Robert Towne) stars as a mustachioed single father and dedicated shopping center security guard covered with a coating of sadness and desperation so thick and oppressive its sheen can probably be detected from other galaxies. When the mall is taken over by a gang of insanely acrobatic criminals that seems to have emerged from an 80s skateboarding movie James makes a startling transformation from sad sack to supercop. Plausibility is Mall Cops first and most brutally dispatched casualty. Where most Happy Madison productions are crude gag fests with a perfunctory emotional streak Mall Cop is a shamelessly sentimental comedy with a few crude gags thrown in arbitrarily. With his gelatinous physique and hangdog persona James suggests Ernest Borgnines Marty more readily than Sandlers rage-prone man-children. Mall Cop is defined more by pathos than raunch though in its second half the film turns into a stale riff on Die Hard. James has a sweet appealing presence but the dreary joke-light script and generic direction do him no favors. He and his collaborators have given the title character a funny name a funny mustache a funny job and a funny Segway to scoot around on. They merely neglected to give him anything funny to say or do.

Paul Blart Mall Cop is incredibly one of two shopping-center security comedies slated for release this year. The other Observe and Report stars Seth Rogen as a bipolar mall cop; Paul Blart stars Kevin James as a hypoglycemic patrolman of a fictional mall in West Orange N.J. You might say that in Blart about a plus-size joe who passes out when he misses a meal James evolves from The King of Queens to The Jester of Joisey. The film cowritten by the jolly James and Nick Bakay is much like one of those Pixy Sticks that Blart periodically sips to boost his blood sugar It has absolutely no nutritional value but it makes you giddy. Bottom line The film is completely forgettable frequently funny and weirdly satisfying in a Jersey Loser Gets Respect kind of way. As the lonely guy and single father James is a pudgeball on a Segway pulling wheelies and turns on the motorized scooter that you would not have thought were possible. This proves handy when the valiant mall cop goes up against a gang of skateboard virtuosos and gymnasts who hold up the shopping center. Directed as functionally as possible by Steve Carr the movie lacks much visual distinction. But it is distinguished by the nimble humor and nimbler moves of James who has Charlie Chaplins gift for making you believe that though his character is lying in the gutter he is looking at the stars.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Which is to say nearly nothing. Its Kevin James as a pathetic loser of a mall-security officer (the title matters evidently) whos called on to be a hero. There are fat jokes slapstick antics more fat jokes and a nod to romance. The entire enterprise depends on James ability to carry a movie to be the kind of down-on-his-luck lovable loser you root for to better himself. Being funny might be nice as well. Sorry. James plays Blart as sweet enough but the talents of the former star of The King of Queens are more suited to the small screen. Note Paul Blart plays in theaters. Paul suffers from hypoglycemia which means hes either eating sugar or forgetting to at which point he passes out. This has kept him from passing the test to become a New Jersey state trooper so he has been relegated to the mall for years tooling around on his Segway trying to give tickets to old people in motorized carts for reckless driving. Its a living. Paul is as unlucky in love as he is at work despite the best efforts of his daughter (Raini Rodriguez) and mother (Shirley Knight). As seriously as Paul takes his job which is to an almost comical degree (its supposed to be comical but doesnt quite get there) he treats the possibility of romance as so unlikely that its not even worth trying for. Better to have another piece of pie. (Really.) Then Amy (Jayma Mays) sets up her hair-extension kiosk at the mall. Shes somewhat charmed by Pauls general ineptness though a night out with co-workers that finds the teetotaling Paul sloshed - the funniest thing in the movie - rightfully gives her pause. The mall employees brace for Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving on which throngs descend credit cards in hand. (At least they did before the economy tanked.) The perfect time to find bargains - and to rob the place. Which is what one smarter-than-he-looks criminal has in mind. His henchmen run skateboard leap and flip all over the mall while trying to get credit-card codes; its as if Cirque du Soleil went on a crime spree. Hostages are taken and through an increasingly ridiculous series of events its up to Paul to save the day. Will our hero have to start believing in himself and prove up to the task? Dont answer. Its a theoretical question. James is an agreeable-enough sort and he makes Paul seem so as well. Certainly Paul Blart Mall Cop wont offend anyone. They say there are two kinds of comedy the kind where you laugh with someone and the kind where you laugh at someone. But this film offers a third kind one where you hardly laugh at all.

One winces for Lisa Kudrow poured into a tight miniskirt as an aspiring rock star and wicked foster parent to two cute orphaned siblings (Emma Roberts and Jake T. Austin) and no less for Don Cheadle as the kindly Child Protection officer who toils to find them a loving family. Collecting strays as they go the children install themselves and a herd of good-looking dogs in a formerly grand downtown hotel and set up a utopian alternative to the pound and the orphanage. Novice director Thor Freudenthal has worked as a storyboard artist and it shows in the movies lone imaginative diversion -- the gizmos set up by a lonely child to entertain the hounds so they wont bark up the authorities. In the department of small mercies the dogs dont talk but the human dialogue is as stale as the characters bathing in love-the-family-youre-with pathos.

(Citywide)NOT EASILY BROKEN Would that the sparring spouses of Revolutionary Road had only thought to turn to the Lord for help; it would have solved all their pesky problems. Such is the lesson to be taken from Not Easily Broken the second feature film (after 2004s Woman Thou Art Loosed) adapted from the novels of Dallas televangelist T.D. Jakes. Directed by actor Bill Duke (whose erratic behind-the-camera career has ranged from the searing neonoir Deep Cover to the altacocker crowd-pleaser The Cemetery Club) Not Easily Broken begins in 1995 with the wedding of pro-baseball player Dave (Morris Chestnut) and upwardly mobile real-estate agent Clarice (Benjamin Buttons Taraji P. Henson) then catches up to the present where a knee injury has sidelined Dave into a contracting career and Clarices taste for luxury finds the couple living well beyond their means. Its not long before the strands of their union begin to fray abetted by a car accident that leaves Clarice with a mangled leg to complement Daves metaphorical knee. Tragedy lurks around every bend here along with the requisite quotient of meddling mothers-in-law derelict baby-daddies and Nordic-looking white temptresses -- all of it played to the rafters for an unsteady mixture of Sirkian melodrama and ""You go girl""/""Oh no he didnt"" empowerment fable. These resourceful actors -- to say nothing of the audience -- deserve better. ""Dont go all Waiting to Exhale on me"" advises one of Clarices soul sisters late in the film. If only. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas)NOTORIOUS In this thoroughly inoffensive biopic about Notorious B.I.G. Christopher ""Biggie"" Wallace is played by Jamal Woolard known as rapper Gravy who does a respectably credible impersonation. It helps that hes a first-time actor; Woolard offers more than just another famous face playing Hollywood Halloween dress-up unlike Derek Luke as Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs and Anthony Mackie as Tupac Shakur. Hes imposing but also gentle a bastard but also an angel and he renders a young Chris Wallaces dreams almost tangible. But director George Tillman Jr. (Men of Honor) who makes square and reliable biopics every decade or so doesnt have time to dwell on the nobody Chris whos too small-fry for the bigtime Biggie story for which the audience has paid its hard-earned. He fast-forwards instead to the glossy glamorous life -- the fuck-you photo-ops with Tupac; the change-the-world meetings with Puff Daddy; the steamy trysts with Lil Kim (Naturi Naughton) and Faith Evans (Antonique Smith); and the nasty run-ins with Suge Knight (Sean Ringgold). The movie turns into a parade of bold-faced names -- a hip-hop stunt-cast episode of Entourage but with a decidedly tragic ending. Notorious doesnt wash away Biggies sins but it absolves him too easily; as every deeds done its explained away by the ghost of Biggie spouting hindsight wisdom. Such is the restraint to be expected from the authorized biography -- Notorious after all was produced by Biggies mom and executive-produced by Combs who do just enough to burnish the legend without tarnishing it.

Sep. 13 600pm GO   OWL AND THE SPARROW The humanistic ensemble drama has gotten such a bad name in recent years thanks to ponderous high-profile entries like Crash and Babel that a barebones plot description of Owl and the Sparrow might convince you that youve seen this movie before -- and more importantly that you dont want to see it again. Still dont let that discourage you from seeking out writer-director-cinematographer Stephane Gaugers lovely debut which tracks a week in the separate lives of three young Vietnamese a flight attendant on holiday (Cat Ly) a zoo employee (Le The Lu) and a 10-year-old runaway (Pham Thi Han). As expected the characters cross paths amid the hustle and bustle of Saigons eight million residents but Gauger forgoes the usual convoluted narrative coincidences in order to craft a refreshingly simple look at loneliness and tentative connection. Those hoping for grander political commentary about Saigons urban poverty will be disappointed; Gauger is less concerned with sociology than in following his guarded but intensely empathetic characters through this slight resonant story. At its core Owl and the Sparrow is yet one more film that preaches the importance of opening your heart and reaching out to those around you but that treacly sentiment is nicely undercut by the unvarnished naturalness of the actors -- particularly young Han who doesnt have a cutesy bone in her body. (Sunset 5) (Tim Grierson)PAUL BLART MALL COP Somewhere beneath its mediocre comedic trappings theres a decent action movie trying to fight its way free from Paul Blart Mall Cop which stars Kevin James as an overweight regular joe who can use only the items in the mall where he works to fight obnoxious extreme sports athletes with guns. Done as an all-out battle to the death this could have been an entertaining mix of Die Hard and The A-Team; the movie briefly sputters to life when the passive policeman-in-training actually has to fight and becomes a badass for a second or two. Alas it takes forever for the plot proper to kick in -- meanwhile there are endless fat jokes which even Chris Farley would have rejected and numerous plugs for the Segway and Perfectmatch.com. That this is a Happy Madison production suggests that James starring role here is a reward for being in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry; that previous Adam Sandler rewards to his friends have included Grandmas Boy and Strange Wilderness ought to be sufficient warning of what to expect.

Paul Blart Mall Cop A New Jersey mall security officer must save the day when a heist shuts down the megaplex. With Kevin James. Directed by Steve Carr. Written by Kevin James amp; Nick Bakay. Columbia/Sony Pictures Jan. 16. (Richard Cartwright / Columbia Pictures) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The thin comic appeal of Kevin James is laid on a bit thicker in Paul Blart Mall Cop his first solo star vehicle for the big screen. As a chunky loner-loser who can never pass the New Jersey State Police exam and never get the girl James practically channels John Candy at his most sympathetic in this not-a-real-cop comedy.""Detect deter observe report"" thats the mall cops motto. But Blart a lonely single dad smitten with the blond who sells hair extensions from a kiosk (Jayma Mays) always goes the extra mile even when elderly customers are running him over with their scooters and obese women are giving him a beat-down or generally abusing him due to his lack of real authority. Blart instructs a rookie in the ways of the job ""giving the illusion that you have a gun"" and the like. He is a master of his domain -- he West Orange Pavilion Mall -- and of the steed that carries him through it a Segway. James balletic mastery of the vehicle for this role (he co-wrote the script) is easily the best thing about Mall Cop. The Segway a pretty good sight gag by itself becomes an extension of the portly Blarts persona -- underestimated able to take a licking and keep on ticketing.James a graceful fat funnyman in the Belushi/Jackie Gleason mold never really transcends the thin story that this lightweight and family-friendly comedy gives us. The movies rank sentiment is Candy-cloned. He even copies the late corpulent Canadians self-defensive laugh. Lets feel sorry for the lovelorn hypoglycemic guy with the gut. Watch him slather peanut butter over moms (Shirley Henderson) apple pie after his latest State Police washout. ""Peanut butter. It just fills the cracks of the heart.""The movie is about Paul Blarts greatest challenge -- a mall robbery with hostages. Blart must fend off trigger-happy Jersey SWAT cops led by the guy who bullied him in high school (Bobby Cannavale) and pick off a reindeer-named pack of skateboard-riding parkour practicing robbers one by one rescue the girl and save the day.Yawn.But the big man still finds big laughs in his characters mall-savviness his self-deprecating use of his girth (hes the butt of his own butt jokes) and his many Segway moments.

After wisely affixing himself to Will Smith (""Hitch"") and Adam Sandler (""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"") Kevin James rides solo in ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" an almost shockingly amateurish one-note-joke comedy on which the star also shares writing and producing credit. Seemingly designed to facilitate mall marketing and retail tie-ins the movie itself has only one consistent strategy -- namely capitalizing on James adeptness at hurling his sizable bulk around. It is pardon the expression an extremely slim approach which should yield quickly diminishing returns after a more solid opening than most actual malls are seeing in this economy. Having successfully made the comic-to-actor transition on the sitcom ""The King of Queens"" James possesses an inherent sweetness and an amiable-lug quality. Along with his penchant for pratfalls there are hints of the late Jackie Gleason in him -- though with efforts like ""Mall Cop"" any similarities will pretty much end there. Directed by Steve Carr (""Daddy Day Care"") the movie is so shoddily edited that there are glaring gaps in the action including a chase sequence that begins within the mall and suddenly inexplicably winds up on the roof. The same goes for a left-field twist involving the protagonists daughter just to name a few of the ""Huh?"" moments as if somebody decided trimming the fat was the only way to make this food-court flotsam palatable. The premise ostensibly hopes to spoof ""Die Hard"" with rejected state trooper applicant-turned-security guard Paul Blart (James) as the ""man on the inside"" forced to defend a New Jersey mall after high-tech thieves have seized control. While Paul tools around on a Segway the thieves navigate the shopping center on skateboards for no particular reason other than the fact that 12-year-olds -- who clearly represent the target audience of this PG-rated endeavor -- tend to like them. A divorced dad who takes the expression ""comfort food"" to extremes that include slathering peanut butter on pie Paul has set his eye on Amy (Jayma Mays carving out an odd niche as the object of nerd affection having played a similar role on ""Heroes"") who staffs one of the mall kiosks. Naturally shes among the hostages taken prompting Paul to seek creative ways to thwart the bad guys who fortunately appear to have guns only when they have no opportunity to shoot at him. Although produced by Sandlers company the project appears to have been made on a budget of the big-box-store variety. Still even given the movies modest ambitions its surprising to see a studio release in which details like continuity and coherence are such a conspicuous afterthought. James still has potential as the kind of unorthodox leading man who resembles a sizable portion of America and he has mastered a hangdog expression that makes him easy to root for. Enduring ""Mall Cop"" though only brings to mind the depressing scenario currently playing out in malls all over Even with cut-rate goods at discount prices the answers no sale.
