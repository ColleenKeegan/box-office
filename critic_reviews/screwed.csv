At once brazenly slapdash and desperately frenetic ""Screwed"" is latenight cable TV filler disguised as a feature film. Dumped into theatrical release May 12 without benefit of press previews this lamentably lame comedy may vanish from most megaplexes before Memorial Day and almost certainly will appear on vidstore shelves by summers end. Pic marks the co-directing debut of Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski the screenwriting duo behind ""Ed Wood"" ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Man on the Moon."" At first glance ""Screwed"" might appear to have more in common with a couple of the pairs less prestigious efforts ""Problem Child"" and ""Problem Child 2"" but dont be fooled The latter two comedies were fitfully amusing guilty pleasures. By sharp contrast ""Screwed"" provides only a few random laughs separated by long periods of mirthless tedium. Indeed some stretches are so painfully unfunny ticket buyers may actually find themselves feeling sorry for the folks onscreen. Norm Macdonald appears stiff and uncomfortable in the lead role of Willard Fillmore the overworked and underpaid chauffeur of a miserly cookie mogul Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch). A thoroughly nasty old biddy Miss Crock treats Willard as an indentured servant and behaves as though shes doing him a favor by not treating him worse. Willards father worked himself to death for the ungrateful crone. After 15 years of service Willard appears ready to follow in his fathers footsteps. Famished for revenge Willard and buddy Rusty P. Hayes (Dave Chappelle) hatch a plot to kidnap Miss Crocks beloved pet a small dog whose bark isnt nearly as a bad as his bite. Not surprisingly the dog outwits the would-be abductors and escapes from their truck. But when Miss Crock discovers the ransom note -- along with all the blood that gushed from Willards hand when the dog gnawed him -- she assumes that Willard has been snatched. At first the tight-fisted cookie mogul is unwilling to pay the  5 million ransom. But when her refusal proves to be a public relations disaster she reluctantly agrees -- with a little prodding from Chip Oswald (Sherman Hemsley)  her chief business adviser -- to fork over the money. Willard and Rusty hope to cover their tracks after grabbing the cash by faking Willards death.To this end they try to obtain a corpse from zany coroner Grover Cleaver (Danny DeVito) whos promised  100000 for his help. One thing leads to another the ransom pickup is botched Willard winds up in a hospital bed -- and the coroner is implicated in the faux kidnapping. Nothing good comes of this. Additional complications are introduced serving only to make the pic longer not funnier. Although it lasts merely 81 minutes -- and mind you thats counting all of the closing credits -- ""Screwed"" feels padded and repetitious. Sporadically Alexander and Karaszewski toss a few gross-out gags into the mix. But theyre too timid -- or too eager for a PG-13 rating -- to try anything more outrageous than a geyser of blood from Willards dog-bitten hand or a few odd objects retrieved from colons by the cheery Grover. Instead of qualifying as black comedy ""Screwed"" often comes off as dingy gray silliness. Macdonald was showcased to better advantage in his first starring vehicle ""Dirty Work"" -- which come to think of it also was withheld from critics before its opening day. Chappelle makes an adequate foil and has a few modestly amusing moments but Stritch sustains a single shrill note of brassy bitchiness throughout. DeVito doesnt show up until a third of the way into ""Screwed"" as the demented coroner with an inexplicable passion for ""Hawaii Five-0."" Even so DeVito manages to do a lot more for the pic than the pic does for him. As the cop in charge of the kidnapping case Daniel Benzali walks around looking like a man with a bad taste in his mouth or an actor who knows hes made a bad career choice. Drab cinematography by Robert Brinkman doesnt exactly enhance the less-than-festive mood. Other tech credits are no better than necessary.

Theyre the screenwriting duo who penned ""Ed Wood"" ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Man on the Moon"" - marvelously original ironic biopics in which the lower the hero falls in the worlds eyes the higher he rises in ours. Each of these movies was heady audacious and a box office dud. Combined they grossed less money - 5.9 million 20 million and 35 million respectively - than ""Deuce Bigalow"" or ""Blue Streak"" alone. And so Alexander and Karaszewski are trying to reassert their value. In their first outing as writer-directors theyve made a black-comic farce called Screwed and its a shrill stupid brickbat-blatant piece of hackwork that practically sweats to be ""commercial."" The film stars Norm Macdonald who even when hes being interviewed comes off like a zombie impersonating a game-show host; when he attempts to act hes even stiffer. He plays Willard manservant to Miss Crock (Elaine Stritch) a sadistic biddy who treats him worse than her dog. Instead of quitting he comes up with a convoluted scheme to kidnap the pooch and then himself. He and his partner (Dave Chappelle) enlist the aid of an undertaker played by Danny DeVito who beneath a Musketeer beard and comb-over fright wig looks and sounds exactly like Danny DeVito. There are poo-poo jokes dental-plate jokes moldy-corpse jokes Jack Lord jokes and ""old lady getting dragged down the stairs"" jokes. With any other filmmakers I would have called this cynicism. In the case of Alexander and Karaszewski its more like masochism They appear to be locking themselves in the screenwriters doghouse and reveling in their worst notions of what they think Hollywood wants.
