Cheesy synthesizer music a collection of scenes that have been done a dozen times before the buddy cop movie boiled down to the bare essentials. But homages are tricky things arent they? I mean I could do a stick figure drawing of Michelangelos David but you probably wouldnt line up to take clandestine camera-phone photos of it would you? The homage is only as good as the work itself not the work its cribbing from. Somewhere in loving the 80s Lethal Weapon-ish fare Cop Out speeds off the rails and crashes into simply being a bad movie. And a bad movie no matter the original intent is still just a bad movie although there is a somewhat serious conversation to be had here regarding intent. If a filmmaker makes something thats not entertaining or interesting do we give him credit because he meant to do it? Would we give credit to people who hit themselves in the head with a hammer even if it was done on purpose? Quite the contrary I think wed implore them not to do it again. As youve probably surmised from the marketing Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis are partners detectives who dont do things by the book. Cop Out doesnt have opening credits (a move which I give extra points for) were just delivered instantly to an interrogation where T-Morg is doing his thing. It should be said (and so Ill write it) that Mr. Morgan is one funny fellow. Hes transcendent in 30 Rock and of the 20 total laughs the movie contains a good 75 percent come from Morgan just riffing. The script itself seems relatively unfunny and if they hadnt cast Morgan my guess is they just would have given up on the project altogether. Bruce Willis comes off less great -- replacing him with a statue or inflatable doll might have provided more oomph -- and Seann William Scott is largely unused in what amounts to a cameo (regardless of what the trailers indicate). Theres a famous quote about Oakland from Getrude Stein that goes a little something like ""There is no there there"" and the same could be said of Cop Out. Theres really not much to talk about. Theres a snarling and cartoonish villain a directionless and contrived plot and each scene bleeds into the next. Youve seen all of it done better in films created two decades prior to Cop Out as if the last twenty years of filmmaking lessons were ignored. Theres a glaring logic issue as Bruce Willis attempts to pay for his daughters wedding though that wouldnt have mattered if the film was making you laugh. Theres some potty humor some physical comedy and some decent cursing. But the whole endeavor feels really joyless as if Warner Bros. gave the project to Kevin Smith and then gave him notes every day telling him exactly what to do. I dont think Kevin Smith could have pulled off a movie this bad without a ton of interference; his movies prove hes capable of comedy though perhaps his not writing the script here allowed him to check out emotionally. Im not sure where the exact fail-a-tude started I only know that almost everyone involved is capable of far better work. Warner Bros. is a proud studio with a robust history. Kevin Smith has made five films I really dig. Bruce Willis is John McClane. Im on the record as calling Seann William Scott the most underrated comedian in the business and Tracy Morgans Tracy Jordan makes me laugh weekly. The combination of all these potent powers should have been a sublime one. Instead its a rancid mess. Theres a scene late in the movie that takes place in what appears to be an abandoned bar. There are no bartenders no customers just Bruce Willis and two other guys. One of the guys as Bruce Willis is approaching him for the meet remarks ""He came."" The other guy pipes up with a genius-level ""He had to."" Luckily you dont.

Sadly his Brooklyn buddy cops are not so much mis matched as miscast comedian Tracy Morgans (right) tiresome shtick as Bruce Williss long-time loose-cannon partner is more suited to the cheeky sidekick character he should be playing while Williss role as the grumpy stooge wastes his talent for snappy dialogue delivery. Not that theres any quick-fire humour to be  had from Robb and Mark Cullens lacklustre script; or much in the way of gunfire either. The tedious plot concerns the theft by a memorabilia-obsessed Mexican drug dealer Poh Boy (Guillermo Diaz) of Williss rare valuable baseball card which the cop needs to sell to pay for his daughters wedding. To add insult to injury Smith lured the composer of the  Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack Harold Faltermeyer out of retirement to write the electronic score for this puerile slapstick crap.

As he goes at the slimeball Hodges partner of nine years Detective John Monroe watches dumbfounded by the number of familiar movies Paul borrows his loose-cannon fodder from ""Heat"" and ""Training Day"" to name a couple. The list goes on and on getting wackier and going amusingly astray. ""Cop Out"" teams Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan as the likable by-their-own- book cops Monroe and Hodges. Hodges calls his role-playing ""homage."" But ""Cop Out"" is a tribute not to the grit of certain police dramas but to the glib grousing of 1980s cop-buddy flicks. Directed by indie rebel and Southwest Airlines foe Kevin Smith ""Cop Out"" is a little too well-shot to be full-on cheesy and too much a redux to be well as fresh as ""Beverly Hills Cop"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" were when they were released. Both get a wink here. Written by brothers Robb and Mark Cullen the movie works a setup as transparent as MSG-infused broth. Hodges is fretting that pretty wife Debbie (Rashida Jones) is cheating on him. Monroe must sell a rare baseball card to foot the bill for his daughters wedding. Hes vying with her stepdad played by a strikingly cleanshaven Jason Lee. Turns out Monroe is not the only baseball fan. Enter a thief named Dave and a gangster called Poh Boy who has his own museum of memorabilia. The plots ladled to get to the banter and Monroe and Hodges have some of the pleasing give-and-take dynamics of Abbott and Costello though the two are at their funniest with a foil like Seann William Scott whos winning and idiotic as Dave. The detectives enlist him to get the stolen baseball card back. The Mexican gang stuff is lame maybe even a bit offensive. But Guillermo Diazs turn as Poh Boy comes close to an inside- the-park homer. Hes crazed and charismatic. The actor who did a stint as a trafficker on ""Weeds"" has an appealing baby face yet he seems full of pent-up erotic energy which he channels into his brutal biz. There is a distressed damsel natch. Ana de la Reguera plays a Mexican national. She has something Poh Boy wants. Shes just one more rung in a rickety plot. But the women arent shrill merely serviceable. The fab exception comes when Susie Essman (""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") commits a Class 3 felony when she steals scenes as an irate homeowner being burgled. For the most part the womenfolk are beside the point. ""Cop Out"" is about different long-term partnerships. Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody portray competing more compliant cops. Even they are working through their relationship. The film is rated R mostly for randy language and action violence. Smith says that in directing the first film he didnt also write hes made the sort of goof hed love to have seen with his dad when Smith was 13 years old. Hes onto something. Our inner teen chuckled guffawed -- and then looked around embarrassed. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com; also on blogs.denverpostcom/madmoviegoer ""COP OUT.""

Its a funny if limited bit but soon you realize the jokes on you. Movie Information Cop OutRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Kevin SmithActors Bruce Willis Tracy Morgan Guillermo Diaz Kevin Pollack and Adam BrodyRun time 110 minutesMPAA rating R (language violence sexual content)Synopsis Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis are partners against crime in this romp.More movies from GuideLive.comCop Out is like a parody of a parody of a parody so derivative and desperate in its pleas for laughter that its hard to tell when its making fun of itself and when it has simply run out of ideas. If this is a comic riff of bad 80s cops movies its also dangerously close to the real thing.Morgan all impish charm and Bruce Willis the smirk that launched a thousand hits play longtime NYPD partners who just cant play by the book. Original no? Soon after a slow-motion strut into the frame and some ensuing shenanigans they get hauled in and suspended by the chief. They spend the rest of the film navigating a haphazard plot involving Mexican thugs from central casting (perhaps mainstream movies last bastions of permissible racism); talking about bowel movements; chasing a valuable baseball card; negotiating with a potty-mouth 10-year-old car thief; and doing you know wacky stuff.Cop Out wears its infantile streak as a badge of honor so its little surprise Kevin Smith directed (from a screenplay by Robb and Mark Cullen). Smith can hit the spot when he works with a modest scale; his ambling banter-happy small films especially the seminal Clerks have a shaggy shooting-the-breeze feel. They create the illusion that youve stumbled into an amusing conversation between old friends.Youll find scattered touches of such personality in Cop Out. The main thug for instance collects baseball memorabilia a detail that leads to the chase for a 1952 Topps Andy Pafko. But for the most part the picture plays like Smith filtered through a Hollywood focus group of bored 14-year-old boys. The script certainly doesnt help his cause. Sample line spoken by a secondary cop ""Maybe we should find out what got these hombres in so much hot salsa."" Really? If that tin-eared nonsense is supposed to sound ridiculous Cop Out never shows that its in on the gag.Then theres this Smith for all his gifts with throwaway moments has absolutely no rhythm as an action director. You could consider this a handicap for an action-comedy especially when the laugh lines overlap with grisly acts of gangland violence.That leaves us with the two monster egos in the middle doing their best to crack each other up succeeding often enough to prevent total catastrophe. Morgan at his best playing an ultra-annoying version of himself on 30 Rock can disarm tortured dialogue with a flash of improv or a childlike mannerism (he has a knack for wiping his nose with the back of his hand). Willis has always been a solid straight man; when hes not blowing away baddies or saving the day he can make a day of reacting to the surrounding chaos.Thats all he has to work with here. Cop Out is the kind of movie that throws a series of semifamiliar faces on the screen - Seann William Scott as a wiseacre thief Susie Essman of Curb Your Enthusiasm as a foulmouthed gun-toting mom - and expects applause for the effort. Come to think of it thats not just a cop-out.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Kevin Smiths ""Cop Out is a white-guy/black-guy buddy comedy with Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan. And only a fool would believe that this spit wad of potty jokes and F-grade storytelling is more than one of the fake movie posters in Morgans ""30 Rock dressing room. In other words a joke. ""Cop Out would hang just fine next to ""Who Dat Ninja.Really though ""Who dat director? Smith for the moment has given up on the wit he flashed in ""Clerks and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and tamed in ""Dogma. His best humor arises from his pointed observations about the many ways in which popular culture brightens and pollutes our lives. As a moviemaker he has his moments always courtesy of his writing which substitutes exuberant obscenity for true feeling. He trusts sex organs and orifices more than he does the human heart.Not that ""Cop Out needs to be ""Dear John although Morgans success as a comedian stems almost entirely from his emotionalism which is somewhere between a breakdown and a tantrum. He also talks - and walks and runs and gesticulates and pretends to think - like a giant baby. ""Jim he says to Willis at some point ""I just got shot Hes not childish. Hes fetal.Morgan and Willis play New York police detectives looking for a baseball card a Mexican gangsta (Guillermo Diaz) and his missing Mercedes though not necessarily in that order. Morgan is the hothead. Willis is the baldhead. And the movie wants to send up hoary action- and buddy-movie cliches including the tinge of gay attraction that passes between the stars. But its too fuzzily executed to pass muster as satire. Plus it loves the cliches too much to subvert them.Instead it makes digressions. Morgans character Paul thinks his improbable wife (Rashida Jones in need of her own movie) is cheating on him. But shes married to Morgan. What other choice does she have? And Willis has to figure out how to pay for his daughters 48000 wedding which is about double what ""Clerks cost to make.The movie is enlivened considerably by a faux-""Beverly Hills Cop synthesizer score some well-used songs (who knew Eric B. and Rakim made excellent chase music?) and its minor players. Seann William Scott plays a cat burglar as a prankster/beach bum version of Joe Pescis ""Lethal Weapon 3 character. Scott robs houses using parkour the French street art that ""District B13 made better known. As one of the homeowners he robs Susie Essman (Jeff Garlins wife on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm) gets to launch into one of her famous obscene tirades. And Diaz pumping his stereotype full of showy comic menace makes love to the camera - and the boom mike and the dolly.A quarter of the movie sadly is spent with Adam Brody and Kevin Pollak who are meant to be the dull square cops. They simply point to the likelihood that the filmmakers cant tell whats funny from whats not. This is the first comedy that Smith didnt officially write (Robb and Mark Cullen did). But his scripts were never his problem. Smiths challenge was directing a movie that didnt contain long stretches of tedium and dubious camerawork. ""Cop Out is Smiths most competent-looking movie (look mom a whole crane shot). But the longueurs persist.This time you get the sense that Smith just doesnt care. The slums of Hollywood suit him since they take the pressure off his having to assert himself. After the sour emptiness of ""Clerks 2 and the unconvincing ardor of ""Zach and Miri Make a Porno its possible that Smiths crude moviemaking has run out of inflammatory statements. Who knows.

"Cop Out review Director doesnt deliver in this odd- couple police caper |       NJ.com comments Cop Out review Director doesnt deliver in this odd- couple police caper Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 25 2010 at 437 PM updated February 25 2010 at 448 PM View/Post Comments Warner Bros.Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis on a stakeout in ""Cop Out.""Modest Jersey guy Kevin Smith is the first to tell you hes not the greatest director in the world. And anyone who has seen more than one of his movies would probably be the second. His technical skills have improved over the years -- there were a few sequences in his last film ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" that were nicely shot and put together. And even his most maligned movies (remember ""Jersey Girl""?) have always had moments of real feeling.Cop Out (R) Warner Bros. (116 min.) Directed by Kevin Smith. With Bruce Willis Tracy Morgan. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating One and a half stars Rating note The film contains constant profanity violence and sexual situations. But Smiths greatest talent has always been as a comic screenwriter. With a mental dumpster of pop trivia and a willingness to go anywhere for a gag hes been like the husky love child of Quentin Tarantino and Howard Stern churning out rich raunchy dialogue. So why would anyone hire him to direct someone elses script? Particularly such an unfunny script as ""Cop Out""? Thats a puzzlement although its not hard to figure out why Smith said yes. Hes admitted the box-office failure of ""Zack and Miri"" left him deeply depressed; why not ease back into movie-making by taking on someone elses ready-to-go-project? Unfortunately its the project thats the problem. And Smith -- whos always created his own films from scratch -- doesnt seem to have a clue about how to rescue it. The movie stars Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan as a couple of Brooklyn cops one tense and unsmiling the other manic and clownish. (No points for guessing who plays who.) After Willis is robbed of a valuable baseball card the two dive into a strange cliched world of kidnapped Latina spitfires and inhuman Mexican mobsters. And were dragged down with them. The film might have been interesting if Willis and Morgan had switched parts and played against type (or if it had been made with its original announced cast James Gandolfini and Robin Williams). But instead the stars simply fall back on old shtick Willis coasting and smirking and Morgan carrying on like a lunatic. As for Smith his approach seems to have been to treat this as a parody of the comic cop movies of his youth; he even hired Harold Faltermeyer the echt-80s composer of the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" soundtrack (and Donna Summers ""Hot Stuff"") to add some old-style generic funk. But a parody of a comedy isnt an easy -- or usually funny -- proposition and ""Cop Out"" simply doesnt have the jokes. The movie lurches to life whenever Seann William Scott shows up as an armed robber; theres a mad glint in his eyes and Smith responds to it. Briefly were back in ""Clerks"" territory. But then he ambles off and were back to Morgan literally spitting out his lines and Willis standing there and glowering. We need Jay and Silent Bob; instead were given Spray and Violent Dud. (And some far too gruesome torture scenes including one of a man dragged behind a car -- played for laughs.) Smith is a funny fellow with a talent for creating raging and enraging people (after his recent real-life in flight troubles Id love to see him try a new twist on ""Planes Trains and Automobiles""). But this ""Cop Out"" is well a cop out. Kevin Smith may have needed a big Hollywood comedy right now for a lot of reasons. What his old fans still need though -- and in a hurry -- is a real Kevin Smith movie.

Pictures Kevin Smiths Cop Out should be on the least-wanted list Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | ABOUT TH EMOVIECop Out 1/2 (out of four)Stars Bruce Willis Tracy Morgan Kevin Pollak Adam BrodyDirector Kevin SmithDistributor Warner Bros.Running time 1 hour 58 minutesRating R for pervasive language including sexual references violence and brief sexualityOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Director Kevin Smiths tweets jokes and sharp commentary after being denied a seat aboard a Southwest Airlines flight because of his girth were a lot more engaging than Cop Out (1/2 out of four) his new movie. Cop Out is foul-mouthed but not funny bullet-riddled but not exciting crammed with contrivances that go nowhere. And perhaps worst of all it musters up no chemistry between its buddy-cop leads. VIDEO Watch the trailer The fault lies in part with the leaden and sophomoric script by brothers Robb and Mark Cullen. But the direction also seems unfocused and in need of tighter editing. Bruce Willis shrugs his way through the movie putting little effort into his part as NYPD Detective Jimmy Monroe partnered for nine years with Paul Hodges (30 Rocks Tracy Morgan). Morgan is grating and obnoxious overacting in a cringe-inducing way. The pair are bumbling but rarely comically so. The overall story is ill-conceived and convoluted. Scenes drag on and characters -- especially the criminals -- come off as caricatures. Sometimes it seems as if Smith is trying to feebly send up the buddy-cop genre and other times this seems intended as a serious installment in the tired film category. Either way it doesnt work. Much is made initially of Morgans efforts to pay tribute to seminal movies. He mutilates the word ""homage"" repeatedly but it doesnt get funnier the more times he does it. Seann William Scott has a marginally funny scene or two as a stoner criminal with a sensitive streak uncanny martial-arts skills and a truly irksome habit of mimicking peoples speech at the moment they utter something. A rare baseball card figures into the goings-on which involve the nefarious actions of a Mexican gang. The gang members are astoundingly stereotypical as is a kidnap victim (Ana de la Reguera) who speaks no English blinks uncomprehendingly a lot and repeats ""Hi"" at inappropriate times. This is meant to pass for humor? Whether publicity stunt or not Smiths airline antics fly higher than this filmmaking effort.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Cop Out"" is a silly waste of time. In other words its just what we need right now. An outrageously smutty comedy that riffs on cop movie cliches even as it uses them to anchor its loopy plot its got automatic weapons Tracy Morgan in overdrive and Bruce Willis rolling his eyes in a way that says ""Im surrounded by crazy people."" Even if you think its a mess you have to admit its no bore. Brooklyn cops Jimmy (Willis) and Paul (Morgan) are celebrating their ninth anniversary as partners and like lots of longtime couples they live to push each others buttons. Paul is a manic jabber-jaw Jimmy the exasperated old pro. In their introductory scene Paul interrogates a suspect by pummeling him while bellowing dialogue from ""Star Wars"" ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" Jimmy on the other side of the one-way mirror mists the glass with his breath and doodles naughty graffiti. Not only does their performance art break up a dull workday -- an audience of cops bursts into applause -- it gets them a lead on nefarious Mexican drug dealers that launches the narrative arc. Each cop has family problems. Jimmy has to sell a rare baseball card to finance his daughters dream wedding or else face humiliation by his ex-wifes new husband (sneering Jason Lee). Paul is convinced his wife is cheating on him while hes on stakeout with his partner. The story zigs and zags between the guys private lives and detective stuff; it never settles into a smooth groove but I was glued to it. A lot of us are juggling private anxieties and job responsibilities these days and the movies characters seem more true to the times than the usual single-minded cop protagonists. The stars have an off-balance rapport. Morgan has never been my cup of tea on TV -- hes too much the spotlight hog -- but here his monkeyshines gain momentum. The nuttier he acts the funnier he gets. He overplays everything. Willis smirk is firmly in place but for the first time in years he seems actually amused. Seann William Scott plays a sneering wiseacre thief who pops in and out of the movie when it needs additional comic relief. Kevin Pollack and Adam Brody play a pair of obnoxious but likable rival detectives. This is one of those movies where you think ""That must have been a fun set."" COP OUT  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS RATING R FOR PERVASIVE LANGUAGE INCLUDING SEXUAL REFERENCES VIOLENCE AND BRIEF SEXUALITY. The movie hums along thanks to the snappy performances and the hand-held on-the-fly cinematography. Its the first studio feature from Kevin Smith who gave us the great ""Clerks"" and a bunch of movies that were more of a chore than a pleasure. He still has no clue how to tell a story visually. He doesnt shoot action very well which is sort of a handicap. When the shooting starts it feels like Hollywood action business as usual. But Smith knows how to be funny. The film stands as proof that great low comedy doesnt require a great plot -- or a plot at all. Coherence? Logic? Suspense? Fuggeddaboutit. From the title on ""Cop Out"" is a grab bag of infantile jokes a free-associating ode to Jerry Bruckheimer action comedies. Its discombobulated but not incoherent. It hangs together as a crime story -- barely. The jokes are elbow-to-the-ribs obvious but solid. When one of the cops puts some serious hurt on an underage carjacker it reduced me to a puddle. The writers Robb and Mark Cullen grab zingers from thin air juggle them and toss them away with a flourish. The banter is fast and funny ping-pong exchanges that leave you straining to stifle your giggles so you dont miss a beat. Its a slovenly lowbrow nutbrain classic.

"Cop Out - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Cop OutKevin Smiths lowbrow buddy-cop comedy is ridiculous fun.February 26 2010|By Betsy Sharkey | Film Critic Tracy Morgan left and Bruce Willis in A""Cop Out.A"" (Abbott Genser / Warner Bros. )There really is no good reason to recommend ""Cop Out."" There are however about a dozen bad ones starting with the fact that its the first gross-out comedy to come along since ""The Hangover"" that is actually a comedy and not just gross although make no mistake gross it is -- this is a Kevin Smith film after all -- so dont say you werent warned. But there is enough ridiculous fun in the Tracy Morgan- Bruce Willis pairing as two of Brooklyns ""finest"" to get many of you past the squirm-inducing stuff like the graphic poop jokes though the sheer verbal dexterity of the screenplay on the subject is so disgustingly inspired at times that the rest of you will be wiping away tears. Id give you an example but nothing would make it past the censors here. ""Clerks"" director Smith most recently in the news for supposedly having a wider body than the Southwest plane he was kicked off of has brought the best of his slacker auteur sensibility to the buddy-cop tradition. I mean he made Bruce Willis the adult instead of a gun-toting nutcase who needs a minder. If you know Tracy Morgan from ""30 Rock"" where he plays a very thinly disguised version of his comedy club shtick via a character named Tracy Jordan theres more of him to love or loathe. Surprisingly -- thanks to what may be the perfect lowbrow teaming of comic director and screenwriters -- the shtick mostly sustains past the two-minute mark what he usually gets on TV. Scene-stealers It all starts on the buddies ninth anniversary as partners which Paul (Morgan) wants to celebrate he even bought a card for heavens sake and Jimmy (Willis) would rather forget. But that Hallmark moment softens Jimmy up and he folds sort of letting Paul take on the interrogation of a small-time drug dealer. That turns out to be the gift that keeps on giving as Morgan lifts line after line from all his favorite movies; ""Scarface"" he mouths to the two-way window at one point where a crowd of cops has gathered to keep score. Morgan isnt the only one stealing scenes -- the filmmakers liberally pick up as many buddy cop clichA(c)s as they can carry and play them to the max. The make-them-hand-over-their-badges-and-guns-in-the-middle-of-a-big-case-theres-no-way-theyll-walk-away-from bit and the we-dont-have-a-clue-but-well-definitely-get-in-your-way-by-making-stupid-moves narc team of Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody are among the more significant. But there is much more irreverence to be found in the blueprint from Mark and Robb Cullen the writing brothers behind TVs ""Lucky"" and ""Las Vegas"" who are making their screenwriting debut here. Theyve given a very capable cast a lot to play with. Willis turns out to be a good foil for Morgan creating a wall of amused restraint for the hyperbolic comic to bounce off of. Meanwhile Pollak just looks perpetually amused by the proceedings whether the scene calls for it or not but somehow it works anyway. Driving the action is a completely insane Mexican drug kingpin (Guillermo Diaz) with a baseball jones that proves to be a critical fact to tuck away. Driving Paul and Jimmy insane is a completely crazy Parkour burglar a strangely engaging Seann William Scott. There is a kidnapped Spanish spitfire named Gabriela (Ana De La Reguera) and in keeping with the films completely un-PC approach she cant speak a word of English so ""stuff"" happens. And in keeping with classic buddy-cop conventions Jimmy has a daughter ( Michelle Trachtenberg) to disappoint and both guys have problems with their wives current and ex. Car chases too While ""Cop Out"" has moments that lag and there are times when the dialogue is truly cringe-worthy (and not just because its gross) the Cullens hit more than they miss. If youre worried theyve gone soft on the action there are more than enough well-crafted shootouts and car chases to keep the adrenaline junkies in the room satisfied. The Cullens particular brand of off-center off-color turns out to suit the directors tastes just fine. After some rough sledding Smith seems like hes come home in ""Cop Out"" with his loose easy style helping to take the edge off the R rating. And that is good news since even when hes bad -- say 95s ""Mallrats"" misfire -- as a filmmaker Smith is always interesting (lets give him a pass for ""Jersey Girl""). The director has a distinctive way with satire keeping the cuts below the belt and always sharp whether directed at religion (99s ""Dogma"") or porn (2008s better-than-its-box-office ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno""). Its in the execution of high concepts where Smith sometimes gets lost but that doesnt happen here. There isnt a high concept in sight. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHorrible Bosses manages nicely at the box officeJuly 11 2011Kevin Smiths Southwest Airlines incident sets Web all...February 16 2010Say it aint so Silent BobJanuary 12 2003MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentComedyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-cop-out26-2010feb26,0,1881138.story",200,copout11,copout,latimes
Cop Out Pitiful excuse for entertainment | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCop Out Pitiful excuse for entertainmentGiven a choice between watching Cop Out again or driving iron spikes into my eyeballs I would probably choose Cop Out - but Id have to seriously think about it.If Kevin Smith was going to get kicked off a project it should have been this Bruce Willis Tracy Morgan vehicle.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 26 2010 (Out of 4)Starring Bruce WillisTracy Morgan and Seann William Scott. 110 minutes. Directed by Kevin Smith. At major theatres. 14A Given a choice between watching Cop Out again or driving iron spikes into my eyeballs I would probably choose Cop Out - but Id have to seriously think about it.Article Continued BelowThis pitiful excuse for entertainment is utterly bereft of wit intelligence or craft on any level. The only thing left to screw up would have been to leave the lens cap on the camera. Wait that would have been an improvement.Cop Out isnt so much a movie as it is a cinematic suicide note for Kevin Smiths directing career. After word gets out about how badly he has bungled this routine assignment hell be lucky to get gigs shooting Flipcam videos at childrens birthday parties.How exactly do you botch something thats supposed to be a light-hearted take on 1980s buddy-cop adventures along the lines of 48 Hours and Lethal Weapon?Well for starters teaming Bruce Willis with Tracy Morgan as NYPD partners on a tear is like pairing King Kong with Bubbles the chimp. A frozen car battery has more chemistry than these two and their motivations for working together couldnt be more opposite. This is clearly just a paycheque gig for Willis who may have sent his cyborg from Surrogates to act in his place. His tough-cop routine as Noo Yawk bullethead Jimmy has never been more banal. To say he phones in his performance is an insult to telephones. Has it really come to this Bruce?The desperately unfunny Morgan meanwhile is desperately trying to prove he can handle a co-starring role. But considering that his character Paul is as bright as a small appliance bulb who spends much of the movie dressed like a cellphone wiping his nose with the back of his hand or talking to a stuffed bear the chances of making the A list are slim and none.Then theres the script by sibling hacks Robb and Mark Cullen which has such a faint pulse it could make a corpse seem like a breakdancer. It concerns the quest for a missing rare baseball card owned by Jimmy that is the key to paying for his daughters pricy wedding (thus one-upping a stepdad played by Jason Lee) and also to busting up a cartel run by a card-collecting druglord (Guillermo Diaz).Along for the non-laughs are an actress named Ana de la Reguera whose only claim to fame is that she looks like she could be the stunt double for Penelope Cruz and Seann William Scott who is still doing variations on his moronic Stifler character from American Pie.With one disgusting difference Scotts character Dave a petty thief has a habit of defecating on the rugs of people whose homes he has robbed. This is in keeping with Smiths policy of including as many jokes about human excrement as he can possibly fit into a movie.Memo to Mr. Smith You turn 40 this year. Poop jokes really arent that funny and at your age theyre pathetic.Smith the churner of fratboy fodder like Clerks and Mallrats and occasionally good movies like Chasing Amy is telling everyone who will listen that this is the first film hes directed that he hasnt also written. If this is meant as an excuse for Cop Out its a very weak cop out.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Cop Out Action comedy. Starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan. Directed by Kevin Smith. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director Kevin Smith has made some good movies and some so-so movies but until now he has always been an artist. ""Cop Out"" represents his first act of cinematic cynicism his first crime against his own talent. With this action comedy he has given us 110 worthless minutes a bad formula movie like every other bad formula movie. But thats OK. Hes allowed to do it once. Twice would require an intervention. Three times would mean hes gone over to the dark side. This week the rollicking rip-roaring action duo is made up of Bruce Willis as an unsmiling veteran cop and Tracy Morgan as his partner who is supposed to be the funny guy. But theres nothing funny about Morgan here. The character he plays is a hysterical blunderer with nothing clever to say. And Morgan unguided by Smith is allowed to mug and push for laughs that arent there. The results are miserable not just for Morgan but also for Willis who has to play straight man to a comedian whos bombing. Still the actors alone cant take the fall for this one. Blame the script. Blame the world People must like going to movies like this; otherwise why would Hollywood keep churning them out? Yet ""Cop Out"" is disappointing even compared with other buddy action comedies. It doesnt even get the most basic thing right It makes the lead characters repellent. It doesnt do this intentionally as a kind of ironic statement but accidentally the result of slapdash filmmaking of no one really caring. The very first scene in which Paul (Morgan) interrogates a witness establishes him as an idiot. Then in the second scene the two partners go on a stakeout and they botch it. This is followed by the obligatory action-movie scene in which their boss disciplines them for using excessive force - except this time the boss is absolutely right. Theyre bad cops. They should not be allowed to carry guns. Theres an alternate-universe feeling about these early minutes of ""Cop Out."" The incidents depicted seem to be there to establish sympathy for the protagonists but they boomerang. The boss hates them but he has a point. Two rival detectives (Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody) regard them with contempt but so do we. In yet another early scene the cop played by Willis has a confrontation with his ex-wifes husband but who wouldnt root for funny pleasant Jason Lee over Willis in his mean threatening cold mode? And so the first 10 minutes of ""Cop Out"" tell us that the lead characters are unfunny and not worth watching. The next 100 minutes prove it. In the meantime theres an inept story to muddle through. How inept? Put it this way Throughout the film the older cop (Willis) is searching for a valuable baseball card that has been stolen from him. But if he doesnt find it guess what the consequences will be? Guess what awful terrible thing will happen? Nothing. Nothing at all. Finding it or not finding it will have no effect on anything. It will not help or hurt anyone. Yet thats the story engine of ""Cop Out."" That is the prime mover of the plot something that really doesnt matter one way or the other. Incredible. You dont have to be naive about Hollywood to be amazed by that kind of laziness. -- Advisory Multiple homicides strong language nudity.

One-time indie icon Kevin Smiths first film as a major studio hack-for-hire the shambling 80s mis matched cops homage ""Cop Out"" repeatedly shoots for laughs -- but ends up mostly firing blanks. Not only do stars Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan have zero comic chemistry together there are long stretches when it seems as if both of them would rather be home cashing residual checks than frantically mugging their way through this labored action farce. MORE PopWrap on the ""Cop Out"" red carpet Its a sign of the films general cluelessness -- and an especially dopey script attributed to brothers Robb and Mark Cullen -- that were told its an ""homage"" when Morgan interpolates a series of impressions based on 80s cop movies into the interrogation of a suspect. If you have to explain the joke -- twice -- it probably wasnt funny in the first place. Willis and Morgan (""30 Rock"") wearily play Jimmy and Paul longtime partners in the NYPD who are suspended after their bungling results in a shooting death during a Brooklyn stakeout. Theyre quickly back in action though after a drug-addled crook (Seann William Scott) steals a rare baseball card that Jimmy was planning to sell to pay for his daughters wedding. Their wholly unauthorized pursuit leads them to the Rockaways and a memorabilia-obsessed Mexican drug dealer (Guillermo Diaz). The bad guy wants our heroes to track down his car -- in the trunk of which hes stashed the mistress (Ana de la Reguera) of a rival drug dealer. Exciting stuff. Meanwhile Paul is weepily worried that his wife is sleeping with a neighbor while hes out all night with Jimmy. And Jimmy is jealous of his ex-wifes smarmy new husband (Smith regular Jason Lee). ""Cop Out"" offers a lot of talk -- only very occasionally funny -- and not much action. What action there is is staged and shot perfunctorily at best. Willis basically smirks his way through the proceedings while the gifted Morgan often seems miserable as the butt of most of the films gags. Aside from the emphasis on his scatological humor and letting overly improvised scenes drone on way too long Smiths direction is utterly impersonal. An obsessive about genre flicks Smith may well have something humorous to say about ""48 Hrs."" ""Beverly Hills Cop"" or ""Running Scared."" But you sure cant tell it from the all too aptly named ""Cop Out.""

"Movie review Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgans Cop Out Put it behind bars washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Cop Out Movie review Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgans Cop Out Put it behind bars Tracy Morgan left and Bruce Willis in ""Cop Out"" a tired retread of buddy cop movies. (Abbott Genser) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 26 2010 Director Kevin Smith has said that one of the things that appealed to him about making ""Cop Out"" his action comedy starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan is that its the kind of movie the filmmakers late father would have liked. This StoryCop Out Tracy Morgan cant bail out this comedyWatch the trailerFind showtimes Its a shame the old man isnt around to enjoy it. Much of the movie feels about 25 years too late. Lets start with the music by Harold Faltermeyer. It isnt clear whether Smith chose the composer notable for scoring all three ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies to evoke the cheesy synth sound of a bygone era -- the golden age of the cop buddy flick -- or merely to replicate it. As it is the music sounds less like homage than hoary cliche. Its not the only thing that hasnt aged well. The very concept -- an odd-couple police partnership made up of one level-headed guy (Willis) and one nut job (Morgan) -- was starting to show signs of wear well before ""Lethal Weapon 4"" (1998). Working from a script by brothers Robb and Mark Cullen (making the leap from TV to feature film writing here) Smith does little to dust off the antique. Other than his casting of Morgan -- an unpredictable wild man who does most of the comedic heavy lifting and by the end of the film looks like hes lost 10 pounds through improv sweat alone -- Smith has given us a lazy retread. Not 15 minutes in Jimmy (Willis) and Paul (Morgan) have already botched one case and been chewed out by their captain (Sean Cullen) who confiscates their guns and badges and suspends them without pay. That sets in motion the main plot which revolves around Jimmy and Pauls unauthorized efforts to retrieve a collectible baseball card of Jimmys that has been stolen by a Latino gangster (Guillermo Diaz). Without it -- not to mention without his steady paycheck -- Jimmy wont be able to come up with the 50 grand for the wedding his daughter (Michelle Trachtenberg) has always wanted. All this of course is merely an excuse for Jimmy and Paul to banter bicker and crack wise in increasingly foul-mouthed fashion about such secondary issues as Pauls bathroom habits or his neurotic jealousy about his wife (Rashida Jones) who he suspects is sleeping with a neighbor. Its pretty funny stuff actually. In this case Smith is smart enough to wind Morgan up turn on the camera and get out of his way. What results is a tour de force of sheer comic energy that threatens to rip apart the film -- and its sodden secondhand premise -- like a wad of used paper towels. Its a performance in search of a movie. Seann William Scott is also a welcome off-kilter presence as a disturbingly genial cat burglar apprehended by Jimmy and Paul and later recruited for their mission. (Hint Stay through the closing credits for more of him.) The rest of ""Cop Out"" feels less like a throwback than something that should have been thrown out years ago. From Diazs Poh Boy a sports memorabilia-obsessed villain who tortures his victims in a basement batting cage to Fred Armisens cameo as corrupt Russian lawyer (whose accent wavers between Spanish and Martian) to Jason Lees Roy the smarmy second husband of Jimmys ex-wife ""Cop Out"" is filled with bad guys who are just well bad.  1/2 R.

But it can certainly be done.The good cop/crazy cop routine is a fluffy almost fail-proof Hollywood action-comedy formula. But Cop Out starring Tracy Morgan and Bruce Willis still does it injustice.Its a hyper procession of comic cliches unimaginatively tacked together by director Kevin Smith. (Yeah the guy who recently got booted by Southwest Airlines for billowing beyond his allotted seat space. Now that has the makings of a decent comedy.)As is usually true with this genre the film rises and falls with the mood swings of its gonzo lead - in this case Morgan.The 30 Rock standout is a pinballing cartoon as Paul Hodges a police detective in Brooklyn who is a few chairs short of a patio set.Morgan attacks the role with such wild abandon that at several points spittle flies out of his mouth. His sweet unhinged persona is delightful - but doesnt sustain over the length of a feature film.Willis plays his more grounded partner Jimmy Monroe. There are things the seasoned action star does well but hilarity is not one of them.While the pairing has obvious box-office potential it never really gels on screen. So Cop Out rustles a remarkably large herd of supporting actors through the chute one by one hoping to jolly the audience along.You get everyone from Guillermo Diaz (Weeds) as a baseball-mad drug boss to Susie Essman (Curb Your Enthusiasm) as a foulmouthed homeowner.Cursing is rampant in this film. Subtitles are even provided for the vulgarities spoken in Spanish. Was that really necessary? We got the gist without an explicit translation.Smith swipes elements from any number of buddy-cop predecessors. Seann William Scott as the manic comic foil? Think Joe Pesci in the Lethal Weapon franchise.You also get the obligatory rival detectives (here Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody) who ride and deride our principal crime-fighters (Bad Boys et al.).Alarmingly Smith seems to have borrowed the score from Harold Faltermeyers Casio-chintzy contributions to Beverly Hills Cop with Eddie Murphy. For much of Cop Out the music is so intrusive and excruciating it feels like youre trapped inside a Ms. Pac-Man machine.You want to cut Cop Out some slack because its just so darn eager to please. So lets grant that it will make a reliably fun companion when its on cable 10 times a week. But its not worth shelling out cineplex money for a comedy that gets its biggest laugh from a crotch kick.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

But Smith didnt even write this hit-and-miss gag machine. The credit goes to the Cullen brothers Robb and Mark. Smith directs thats it and oversees a fun rapport between Bruce Willis and comedy MVP Tracy Morgan as NYPD partners trying to track down an invaluable baseball card before getting killed by Mexicans and annoyed to death by a stoner burglar (Seann William Scott). An early scene of Morgan scaring a perp with tough dialogue from movies reminded me of primo Smith. Other scenes not so much. But if youre like me diluted Smith is still better than no Smith at all.

"Cop Out | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cop-out ) Cop Out (United States 2010) A movie review by James Berardinelli Cop Out is Kevin Smiths first foray into mainstream action/comedy entertainment and the first time he has directed a film he did not write. This is evident - although there are a few ribald moments to be found sprinkled throughout the movies humor is muted and rarely attempts to offend the sensibilities of the more strait-laced audience members. Smiths career is largely founded on his reputation as a ground-breaker (his debut Clerks initially earned an NC-17 for profanity although that was reversed on appeal) but with Cop Out the cement beneath his feet doesnt suffer even a hairline fracture. The black/white wisecracker/straight man mismatched buddy cop thing has been done so often that it would demand a monumental effort to make it fresh and Smith isnt up to that kind of heavy lifting. As it turns out Cop Out is a pale imitation (which Smith would no doubt call an ""homage"") of 48 Hours. 15 minutes into this movie I wanted to leave the theater go home and watch the Nick Nolte/Eddie Murphy picture instead. It would have represented time better spent. Over the years Smith has shown the ability to make cursing bodily fluids and graphic descriptions of sexual deviancy hilarious but the laughs to be found in Cop Out are occasional and generally not full-bellied. The filmmaker has always been a better writer than director so for a studio to hire him as the latter and not the former they are playing to his weakness. Indeed Cop Out does not feel like a Kevin Smith movie unless you consider the lack of imagination in camera angles and the large number of static shots to be trademarks. The dialogue even at its most racy is generic and the jokes are lame. There are too many ""laugh track"" moments - gags that provoke a reaction in packed theaters because they are supposed to be funny not because they actually are. Cop Out which bore the abandoned working title of A Couple of Dicks pairs detectives Jimmy Monroe (Bruce Willis) and Paul Hodges (Tracy Morgan). Unlike in many mismatched cop buddy movies these two havent just met - they have been partners for nine years (as Paul notes longer than many Great Danes live). When a bust goes bad an informant ends up dead Jimmy and Paul are given a one-month suspension without pay. That doesnt stop them from harassing the cops who inherit the case (played by Kevin Pollack and Adam Brody) or continuing the investigation on their own time. No one seems to think it odd that two suspended cops are running around arresting suspects rescuing hostages and getting involved in shoot-outs. The ending like most of the action sequences is as anti-climactic as one can imagine. Its tough generating much enthusiasm for a motion picture that does a lot of things but none of them well. The comedy is lukewarm. The action is boring. The dialogue falls far short of the level of wit we normally expect from a Kevin Smith production. And the dramatic elements (Jimmys relationship with his daughter Pauls concern about his wifes possible infidelity) lightweight though they may be fail to resonate. The chief bad guy a drug dealer named Poh Boy (Guillermo Diaz) is presented in full frothing-at-the-mouth mode and is more cartoonish than threatening. The story holds together best if little attention is paid to continuity (snack bar trips and lavatory breaks are encouraged). The filmmakers apparently dont care so why should we? Normally Bruce Willis excels at playing the straight guy with a warped sense of humor. Die Hard is an example of this quality being effectively exploited. Here however he smirks a little too much and lacks the human element that makes John McClane an endearing screen presence. Tracy Morgan is a brilliant comedian whose talents are underused by the screenplay and the director. His contribution involves a lot of mugging for the camera which is typically how comically adept actors are employed when playing staple characters. Hes the ""funny black guy"" and is never allowed to become anything more. The third significant player is Seann William Scott as Dave a thief who helps Jimmy and Paul with their inquiries. Dave who bears more than passing resemblance to the Joe Pesci character in the Lethal Weapon series is annoying. I suppose thats the point but why would filmmakers create someone whose presence is as palatable as rotting carrion? As a fellow critic noted its easy to see why Smith attached himself to this project he gets to work with Bruce Willis achieves some mainstream recognition and receives a healthy paycheck (something important for a family man). The end result works out better for Smith than it does for anyone sitting in the theater watching the fruit of his labors. Okay there are worse movies out there but Im hard-pressed to figure out why Id waste my time and money watching something thats a half-baked retread of better movies I can stream from Netflix.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There are generally two camps on Kevin Smith the Jersey auteur and cult of personality behind Clerks Dogma Chasing Amy and other foul-tongued provocations Either you believe hes the raw honest hilariously crude voice of the people or you most emphatically do not. But few from either end of the divide would claim that Smiths direction is his greatest strength; he may work well with actors but ""perfunctory"" is the kindest word to describe his filmmaking chops. So the idea of a studio bringing in Smith as a director-for-hire makes about as much sense as the Yankees tapping CC Sabathia as a pinch-runner. With Cop Out Smith works from a script other than his own for the first time--this one penned by siblings Mark and Robb Cullen--but his slack direction siphons the energy out of this tongue-in-cheek throwback to 80s mismatched-buddy comedies. Any hope that the Cullens script might enforce a discipline Smith rarely exhibits on his own gets extinguished in the very first scene when it becomes painfully apparent what Smith will be bringing to the table--improvisation and lots of it. With their suspect in the interrogation room Brooklyn detectives Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan partners for nine years (though with a chemistry that suggests they teamed up only yesterday) argue over who gets first crack at him. Morgan wins out and proceeds on an ""homage""-based line of questioning that has him riffing wildly on characters from movies from Al Pacino in Scarface to Oprah Winfrey in The Color Purple. Smith lurches from the strained unreality of scenes like that one into a needlessly soupy plot involving Willis efforts to retrieve a rare baseball card from a Mexican drug kingpin in order to pay for his daughters wedding. Cop Out piles on the references to action-comedies past the Harold Faltermeyer score the perpetually ticked-off captain behind the desk Seann William Scott doing his best Joe Pesci in the back of a police car Willis giving himself a nod by claiming never to have seen Die Hard. A few of the gags score--letting Morgan free-associate isnt always the smartest idea but there are some diamonds in the silt--but most of them sound like Smith thumbing lazily through his dirty-joke file. Still the hangout scenes in Cop Out are at least in Smiths wheelhouse; whenever he has to deliver the obligatory action beats or tie up the many loose ends he seems actively bored. The shrug of a denouement doesnt say ""the movies over"" so much as ""get me the hell out of here.""

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 25 2010 149 PM Title Cop Out Heres what Ive learned about Kevin Smith over the last 15 years Hes smart funny loyal and often has something interesting to say. But I know these things mostly from his blog books podcasts and lectures rather than his films.Despite all his gifts Smith cant seem to translate his talents to the screen in any consistent manner. Hes capable of ""Dogma"" but settles for ""Cop Out.""While his latest effort has its moments its also regrettably ordinary. As he takes pains to note ""Cop Out"" is an homage to 80s action flicks like ""Lethal Weapon."" But a sharp sendup requires more than a score by Harold Faltermeyer.Then again if you know Faltermeyer wrote the theme for ""Beverly Hills Cop"" youll probably appreciate the other in-jokes the biggest of which is the casting of former action icon Bruce Willis.Willis plays Jimmy Monroe a sardonic NYPD officer whos partnered with the manic Paul (Tracy Morgan). When Jimmys daughter (Michelle Trachtenberg) gets engaged he tries to sell a valuable baseball card to finance the wedding. After an inept thief (a mischievous Seann William Scott) steals it Jimmy and Paul get involved with a Mexican gang vastly irritating the detectives (Kevin Pollak Adam Brody) on the case.Smiths a better writer than director so its odd he chose to make someone elses script. (Robb and Mark Cullen wrote the screenplay.) But there are laughs here and there and anyone who retains a deep love for old buddy-cop comedies will recognize the same affection onscreen.Unfortunately too many scenes are undercut by a smirky self-amusement. (The original title ""A Couple of Dicks"" hints at the adolescent smugness.) And while Morgan is his typically loopy self Willis barely makes an effort. Is he worried that hes approaching irrelevance? Or aware that he still deserves better?Because Smith has the ability to make a real artistic impact (and knows it) his disappointments tend to inspire deeper criticism than they deserve. This is no more a terrible movie than a great one; its simply average. Granted its Smiths right to let opportunities pass. But he should be aware that high hopes usually die hard.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Cop buddy picture Cop Out wont be your friend - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 1 starCop buddy picture Cop Out wont be your friendFebruary 25 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Cop Out"" is a buddy cop film in which one of the cops continually quotes dialogue espoused by fictional cops in everything from ""Heat"" to ""RoboCop"" and not once is it funny. The film winks at the audience for 110 minutes. Tracy Morgan plays the motor-mouth NYPD detective partner of Bruce Willis. Now Theres no reason these two couldnt headline a perfectly proficient action comedy in the realm of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" or ""48 HRS."" or ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Running Scared"" or ""Red Heat"" or ""Freebie and the Bean"" or ""Tango amp; Cash"" or ""Turner amp; Hooch"" or ""Pride and Prejudice."" But this is a lousy invention-free script and Kevin Smith -- an interesting and valuable filmmaker here doing his first direction-only work for hire -- cannot do anything to save it. His directorial personality is not to be found. The film makes you appreciate Walter Hills ""48 HRS."" and Martin Brests ""Beverly Hills Cop"" all the more. Both those pictures were nothing more than canny hard-charging volatile commercial entertainments but by placing Eddie Murphy in the middle of The Usual the formula got a right old shaking-up. Also Hill and Brest could shape and finesse an action sequence. Smith can do many things and has in ""Clerks"" and ""Dogma"" and "" Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" and others. But R-rated action in the service of a conventional plot and marketable slaughter isnt yet in his skill set. Willis Jimmy and Morgans Paul chase down Latino gangsters and scurry after Jimmys purloined baseball card the one hes cashing in to pay for his daughters 48000 wedding. (Seems like a dumb way to spend 48000 but then Im not a working-class NYPD detective.) Seann William Scott has a couple of excruciating scenes as a trash-talking punk whom the boys take for a drag across a gravel road. In the 70s the era of ""Freebie and the Bean"" the guy wouldve been dead in a minute; here its sort of a joke and sort of not. And thats ""Cop Out"" in a nutshell. Only ""Beverly Hills Cop"" composer Harold Faltermeyers uber-80s synthesizer score brings back the old ... well not ""magic"" exactly but the old style. mjphillipstribune.com Rating 1 star MPAA rating R (for pervasive language including sexual references violence and brief sexuality)Cast Bruce Willis (Jimmy Monroe); Tracy Morgan (Paul Hodges); Adam Brody (Barry Mangold); Kevin Pollak (Hunsaker); Guillermo Diaz (Poh Boy); Ana de la Reguera (Gabriela); Seann William Scott (Dave); Rashida Jones (Debbie)Credits Directed by Kevin Smith; written by Robb Cullen and Mark Cullen; produced by Marc Platt Polly Johnsen and Michael Tadross.

Comments Cop Out Video 2010 Nothing to see here keep moving. Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan are New York cops whose commander relieves them of their guns and badges after their clumsy pursuit of a Mexican drug lord erupts into a neighborhood shootout. They spend the rest of the story waving around their guns and badges but this is the sort of movie so formulaic that even continuity errors seem refreshing. Director Kevin Smith adds a patina of his idiosyncratic character comedy to a script by TV drudges Robb and Mark Cullen (Heist Las Vegas) but to no avail. If this ever turns up as an in-flight movie Smith should have to watch it twice. With Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody. R. By J.R.

Movies Cop Out by Owen Gleiberman Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr ONE MORE THING OFFICER Seann William Scott tries to get Tracy Morgans attention in Cop Out (Abbot Genser) Posted February 26 2010 -- 1200 AM EST Im always up for a new Kevin Smith film because whatever lark hes tossing off you can usually count on enjoying the sound of his Preston Sturges?meets?Ron Jeremy dialogue a form of wordplay so scrappy and alive that it could never have come out of some Hollywood hacks corporate screenwriting software. In Cop Out however Smith has set himself a special challenge The film is a barely satirical homage to the interracial buddy-cop flicks that flourished in the 1980s and that means Smith is trying to mimic some of the most machine-tooled wise-guy banter in the history of cinema. I hoped hed take the genre and run with it injecting his own overripe nearly scholastic flights of profane observation. Instead working for the first time from a script he didnt write (its by Marc and Robb Cullen) he mimics everything about movies like Running Scared and the Lethal Weapon series thats now best forgotten the slovenly plots and obligatory jackhammer action (which Smith cant stage worth a lick) the fake-outrageous atmosphere of preening strutting misbehavior. What he misses is what made those movies fun and in the case of 48 HRS. classic the testy back-and-forth hostility between black and white crime-fighting partners. As the veteran New York police duo of Cop Out Bruce Willis all coolheaded reserve (hes so Zen here he barely smirks -- or acts) and Tracy Morgan who never stops shouting in baby-voiced hysteria go through their shtick like buddy-comedy robots. Theres never a moment of real abrasiveness or anything else between them -- which may be a sign that this form has outlived its relevance. In the Obama era the notion of blacks and whites having to share an ironic fraught-with-tension bond seems quaintly dated. Without that heightened racial antipathy-turned-camaraderie theres not a whole lot to Cop Out besides watching Kevin Smith pretend with a crudeness that is simply boring that hes an action director making a comic thriller about cops versus a Mexican drug gang (yawn). The movies one bright spot is Seann William Scott who plays the thief who steals the baseball card that Willis needs to finance his daughters wedding. Its the Joe Pesci role (if that) but Scott scruffed to the max with the glittery eyes of a happy sociopath uses his eager boyish quickness knowingly erupting into hilarious flights of echolalia designed to drive everyone around him as crazy as he is. (It works.) Hes a goofball dude all right but a dude with danger -- a flake whos a real lethal weapon.

Cop Out Fair Director Kevin Smith. Cast Bruce Willis Tracy Morgan Seann William Scott. Rating Rated R for pervasive language including sexual references violence and brief sexuality. RELATED Spotlight Bruce Willis Spotlight Kevin Smith Buddy cop movies The very idea of a buddy-cop comedy starring Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan as partners sounds like something ripe to make fun of. But how can we when director Kevin Smith beats us to the punch? Despite reasonable doubts the wink-and-a-nod ""Cop Out"" isnt all that bad. Smith pushes Morgan even further over the top than usual reins Willis in (he mostly stands around looking bemused at Morgans antics) and comes up with a movie that makes little sense is dumb when its not being stupid and yet is still at times laugh-out-loud funny. A scene at the beginning of the film makes Smiths agenda clear. Paul (Morgan) insists on interrogating a suspect. Jimmy (Willis) watches as Paul runs through a series of movie quotes ranging from the semi-appropriate (""Heat"") to the ridiculous (""Star Wars"") to well to ""Dirty Dancing."" Its an homage Paul explains an explanation that would carry more weight if he pronounced the word right. No matter. Its funny with Morgan growing increasingly manic saliva flying as he calls up one quote after another. So does Smith dipping into the well of practically every buddy-cop comedy youve ever seen and doing so with glee. Theres plenty of menace and violence like in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""48 Hours"" movies. But most scenes are played for laughs and a surprising number hit their mark. Jimmys daughter (Michelle Trachtenberg) is getting married and wants an expensive wedding he cant pay for particularly after he and Paul get suspended for botching a bust. Her smarmy step-dad (Jason Lee) is willing to foot the bill but the proud Jimmy wont hear of it. Instead he decides hell sell a rare baseball card. But the memorabilia store hes gone to for an appraisal is robbed by the addled Dave (an out-and-out hilarious Seann William Scott) who makes off with the card. Dave will prove useful to Jimmy and Paul (shades of ""Lethal Weapon"") as they work their way to Poh Boy (Guillermo Diaz) a drug dealer with designs on expanding his empire. He also has a fascination with baseball memorabilia including naturally rare cards. If Jimmy and Paul can find a missing Mercedes for Poh Boy hell give them the card. Finding the car is no problem for them (one of their leads is a blue-mouthed kid car thief) but there is of course more to it than that. The finer details of the plot arent particularly effective. Neither really are Kevin Pollak and Adam Brody as rival cops. For good measure writers Robb and Mark Cullen throw in a plot line involving Paul being jealous of his wife (Rashida Jones). Other bits work better such as Susie Essman channeling the curses-like-a-sailor character she plays on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" lambasting Jimmy and Paul with paint-peeling language even as she saves them. But its really Morgans movie. His and Smiths. This is the first film Smith has made that he didnt write but he brings his usual pop-culture sensibility to it; without that it would be hack work. ""Cop Out"" isnt as good as the films it continually salutes (""Lethal Weapon"" ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and especially ""48 Hours"" were all quite good before they went down the sequel rabbit hole). But it is good at what it does. Smith is not making fun of the movies he references. Hes paying them offbeat tribute. An homage you might say. But its funnier when Morgan says it.

Great buddy comedies are often built upon the tension between two wildly dissimilar personalities thrust together by fate and forced to adapt to one another. In the case of ""Cop Out"" however theres precious little of that tension to be found between co-leads Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan but more than enough between director Kevin Smith and the shoddy script hes elected to take on and neither seems willing to budge. This comic policier will likely notch decent returns for Warner Bros. on the strength of its cast and paucity of its weekend competition though longterm prospects look dubious. ""Cop Out"" marks indie hero Smiths first attempt to direct a script he did not write and given the absence of his garrulous dialogue and sweetly obscene sensibilities the shortcomings of his craft are made all the more apparent. Smiths directorial style is far too slack for this material which aims to be an homage to populist 80s classics like ""48 Hrs."" and ""Lethal Weapon"" but only winds up resembling one of the bargain-bin knockoffs that floundered in those films wake. Though hardly Smiths finest hour the pic is perhaps most regrettable to the extent that it blows its chance to offer wild-man comic Morgan a film vehicle worthy of his anarchic appeal. Here he stars as Paul a manic detective who for unexplained reasons spends a good portion of the film wiping snot from his nose drooling and crying -- one wonders if this was Morgans small form of Brando-esque protest against the material he was given -- and who is partnered with Jimmy (Willis) a grizzled officer whose entire character description seems to have been ""Bruce Willis-ish."" The film opens with an interrogation and subsequent stakeout that the partners botch consequently getting themselves suspended by their hard-ass by-the-book chief (Sean Cullen). The two are unfazed by the setback though Jimmy soon confronts a dilemma that does engage him -- his daughter is set to be married and his ex-wifes smarmy new husband (Jason Lee) is hoping to usurp Jimmys paterfamilias bona fides by offering to pay for the extravagant wedding himself. To raise funds for the wedding Jimmy attempts to sell a particularly rare baseball card only to be robbed. He recruits Paul (who in a wafer-thin subplot suspects his wife of cheating) to help him recover the card and this quickly leads them into the orbit of a baseball-loving Mexican drug smuggler (Guillermo Diaz) whos pursuing a missing car (containing info that will allow him to expand his operation) as well as the mistress of a rival (Ana de la Reguera). The police action here is boilerplate stuff -- despite Smiths encyclopedic knowledge of genre conventions he refrains from offering any personal spin on them -- but the comedic setpieces have all the hallmarks of directionless unsupervised improv. In a painfully overextended sequence Paul and Jimmy arrest a drugged-out burglar (Seann William Scott) who begins pestering Paul by loudly talking over him and repeating his every word and then telling a long unfunny knock-knock joke. Such behavior will be familiar to anyone whos ever been around a particularly bratty 6-year-old and most of them will wonder why theyve just paid good money to see a film with similar sensibilities. Morgan Lee and bit-parter Adam Brody are all inherently funny watchable actors yet none of them find a gag worth selling in Robb and Mark Cullens script. Willis is gifted a few moments in which to work his still-considerable charm though most of the time he seems vaguely distracted if not irritated. Production values are hit-and-miss While the action sequences are competently assembled a few of the pics punchlines and snatches of expository dialogue are rendered incomprehensible through muddy sound and editing.

Pictures/Abbot Genser A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Cop Out establishes its movie lineage right away with a slow-motion toe-to-head tilt up set to the Beastie Boys ""No Sleep Til Brooklyn"" of black-cop/white-cop buddies Jimmy and Paul swaggering stone-faced toward the camera. Director/editor Kevin Smith (who notably didnt write the Cop Out script; this is the Clerks auteurs first feature-length work for hire) immortalizes his heroes as stock crime-flick badasses in their very first frame.So far so middling--until Smith complicates matters by following that shot with an opening sequence that sends Cop Out swerving into smarter territory Determined to prove his bad-cop ""acting"" chops to a skeptical Jimmy (Bruce Willis) Paul (Tracy Morgan) interrogates a perp by subjecting him to an unrelenting marathon of movie character impersonations. Beginning with Al Pacino in Heat and moving logically through In the Heat of the Night and Training Day Pauls ""homage"" (which he pronounces ""homm-ige"") eventually jumps off the rails. Jimmy on the other side of the interrogation-room glass can only gape at his partners increasingly non sequitur charade ""Dirty Dancing? Star Wars? Everything on cable??""And so Cop Out announces itself as both loving ""homage"" to ""everything on cable""--particularly 80s action comedies referenced most directly by Harold Faltermeyers cheap synth score and an honest-to-goodness plot song (called ""Soul Brothers"" and sung by Patti LaBelle)--and a sly subversion of genre. Its a movie that shamelessly trafficks in the cliches of other cop movies while also engaging both characters and audience in the spectator sport of catching references to those very movies. Cop Out only works as well as it does--and it works exponentially better than it should--because the movie-trivia game is played smirk-free with palpable joy from everyone involved.Jimmy a swinging-dick career NYPD cop threatened by his ex-wifes young rich new husband (Jason Lee) tries to sell a priceless long-treasured baseball card so he can pick up the tab for his daughters wedding. That plan immediately goes horribly awry thanks to interventions from Seann William Scott and the scene-swiping Guillermo Diaz as a textbook Mexican movie gangster with a baseball obsession. Jimmy and Paul have no choice but to Break All the Rules.The plot is almost an afterthought an obvious MacGuffin intended to steamroll a path for the charisma and chemistry of the two leads. Morgan has been brutally undervalued for his work on the otherwise heavily awarded NBC series 30 Rock possibly because its assumed that the incorrigible comedian he plays is just a riff on himself. In Cop Out unchained from the temporal constraints and standards and practices of network TV and according to the press notes given free rein to improvise Morgan of course works broad and blue but he really surprises with his timing and self-control. There are comic set pieces in Cop Out that play out at a snails pace turning awkward and uncomfortable for long stretches in order to build toward a big funny and Morgan not only hangs on but steers. Williss main order of business is to stay cool and look good--to provide a solid backboard for Morgans delirious lunacy--and this he does well.Like most of Smiths movies from Clerks to Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back to Zach and Miri Make a Porno Cop Out tracks a small arc of maturation for dudes who filter their own lives through popular culture. There was a sincere love letter to the transformative power of filmmaking baked into Porno but its impact was diluted by what felt like strained overtures to the Apatow audience. On the contrary Cop Out works as a love letter to film fandom and amid the ample violence and genitalia jokes its strength is its sincerity. Working with a full-on studio budget for the first time in his decade-and-a-half career Smith is still making movies about guys just like him. It may be masturbatory but its also some kind of creative integrity.
