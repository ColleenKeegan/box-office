""Stalag 17"" meets ""A Soldiers Story"" in ""Harts War"" a Nazi POW camp drama thats mostly about racial prejudice in the U.S. Army. Absorbing in a low-key way but more dramatic where its secondary characters are concerned than its leads and capped by climactic incidents that are less than entirely convincing in the cause of being ennobling this nicely textured WWII revisit touches only tangentially upon what auds might expect in the way of escape excitement combat and personal heroics. These factors plus the fact that Bruce Willis plays an ambiguous role whose most important actions take place offscreen look to translate into just moderate winter B.O. by Willis standards. Is there something wrong with a German prison-camp movie in which the Nazi commandant is by far the most sympathetic character? Such is just about the case here for with the exception of two black U.S. airmen who are little more than one-dimensional symbols of racial victimization in the armed services the Yank prisoners in the screenplay by Billy Ray (""Volcano"") and Terry George (""In the Name of the Father"") based on John Katzenbachs novel are mostly irascible racists and shifty operators none of them very agreeable as company. By contrast German Col. Werner Visser as splendidly played by esteemed Romanian actor Marcel Iures is the picture of world-weary sophistication. Not only is he urbane and generous by nature hes a major Americanophile Yale class of 28 a fan of Mark Twain and a connoisseur of jazz the banned musical idiom he plays on records in his comfortably appointed quarters; ""They might be the only copies in the Reich"" he points out. No doubt aware that Germany will lose the war overtaxed by the enormous influx of prisoners stemming from the Battle of the Bulge and mourning a son who died on the Russian front Visser even consents to the Americans wish to conduct their own trial of an accused murderer. He is a member in short of that small group of honorable German officers of the screen perhaps best incarnated by Erich von Stroheim in ""Grand Illusion"" as well as a reminder of Jean Renoirs theme in that film that the members of the same class and rank have more in common with each other across national boundaries than do fellow citizens of different status in the same country. If only Col. Visser had a worthy counterpart among his prisoners. The closest thing to it is the Hart of the title Lt. Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell) a fellow Yalie and U.S. senators son whom fate consigns to Stalag VI A at Augsburg Germany in December 1944. His journey there reps one of the more vivid interludes in the picture; arriving at a village railyard the freight cars into which Hart and his fellow Allied POWs are crammed are attacked by P-51s since the ""POW"" signs painted across the tops of the cars are covered by snow. This bloody affair is followed by a forced march across wintery wastes an experience that makes the stalag as welcome as the Waldorf. The top-ranking Yank officer at the camp is Col. William McNamara (Willis) a fourth-generation West Pointer who claiming his officers quarters are full assigns Hart to bunk with enlisted men who greet the upper-cruster with some wariness. This is nothing however compared to the welcome the grunts extend to Lts. Lincoln Scott (Terrence Howard) and Lamar Archer (Vicellous Shannon) members of the 333rd Flying Corps of black airmen. As Sgt. Vic Bedford (Cole Hauser) a cop in his previous life remarks ""If we got niggers flying for us we must be losing the war."" It only gets worse as Bedford and his cronies lob constant insults at the newcomers who stick together and use their rank to try to keep their taunters at bay (""Thats Lieutenant boy"" one of the pair responds when called by a common epithet.) In short order Bedford plants a contraband metal spike in Archers bed which is enough to get the young black man executed by the Nazis. But then Bedfords body is discovered out in the yard and the finger of guilt points squarely at Scott prompting the murder trial to be overseen by McNamara. Up to this point McNamara has been an authoritative but peripheral figure and even afterwards he holds his cards close to his chest; he seems none too partial toward the black aviators and has his own good reason for distrusting Hart who remains an equivocal figure throughout in Farrells subdued performance. Eventually it turns out McNamara has been holding some aces to trump his enemies but these are oddly played in the background which minimizes the dramatic impact of the climax as well as of Williss character whose opaqueness gives the actor little to play. Much of the latter going is given over to Scotts trial which has all the appearances of a charade staged for formalitys sake. Ill-equipped former law student Hart handles the defense and it all looks pretty hopeless even after the thoughtful Col. Visser slips Hart his dog-eared copy of the U.S. Army Courts-Martial manual. A large measure of the films raison detre -- the exposure of discrimination and a double standard in the U.S. military of the time -- is contained in the speeches Scott gives from the stand and theres potent material in them albeit of the textbook civics-lesson variety Protesting his innocence -- ""I came here to kill Nazis. If I wanted to kill crackers I coulda stayed in Macon"" Scott insists -- the defendant regales his fellow Americans and the politely interested Germans with how his father served in WWI how he and Archer had to prove themselves repeatedly to make it through flight school and how back in Georgia German POWs were allowed to go to movies and eat in restaurants off-limits to blacks. The whole sorry history is strong if didactic historical stuff powerfully delivered by Howard. Ending sees all the important surviving Americans trying to outdo one anothers self-sacrificing heroics and final narration tag is badly written in the currently fashionable mode of military ennoblement; the same writing assignment in an immediate post-war film would have possessed a more appropriate tone of ironic balance suggestive of loss on both sides. Director Gregory Hoblit handles the physical side of the picture very well and is helped immeasurably in this by the snowy overcast convincingly frigid Czech locations; Lily Kilverts authentically lived-in-looking prison camp; Alar Kivilos self-effacingly color-drained lensing; and the detailed props and costumes. Modest amount of CGI work is seamlessly incorporated into the films texture and Rachel Portmans score is appropriately brooding and unostentatious.

"Harts War Been There Fought That washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Harts War Been There Fought That Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 15 2002 The monocled leathered and jackbooted scalawags once played by Erich von Stroheim Otto Preminger and Werner Klemperer have nothing on SS Maj. Wilhelm Visser the German prisoner-of-war camp kommandant in ""Harts War."" What a delight this droll fellow is. Hes knowing erudite sophisticated loves decadent jazz and romantic art. Hes familiar with irony. The more he drinks the more amusing he becomes the more pronounced becomes that lofted brow over an amused eye the quicker flashes his repartee the more provoked he is by the fabulous absurdity of it all. In the movies hed be played by George Sanders or James Mason or Raymond Massey. Wait a minute. This is a movie. Boy is it ever a movie. SS Maj. Visser is played by a wonderful Romanian actor named Marcel Iures. Hes one of the moviest things about the film but by no means the only movie thing. Though modern technology has advanced to a level where filmmakers can make you believe thats truly a Mustang and a Messerschmitt mixing it up just above the treetops and not just digital motes of electronic information floating on some cybergeeks hard drive in a mysterious bunker in a lesser zone of Los Angeles this movie is so movie its stereotypes seem Pentium-driven. Besides Iures theatrical Nazi Bruce Willis plays the isolated stoical American commander as if he hasnt had a bowel movement or an emotional one in several decades. Colin Farrell is Our Kid the new boy on the block ever so innocent ever so earnest ever so self-doubting. Cole Hauser makes a loud one-dimensional racist Air Corps sergeant and Terrence Howard is a noble black aviator accused of murder and tried by American rules in the barracks rooms of Stalag VIa. That central conceit is the movies most aching improbability even as it struggles to accommodate too many themes. Would the Germans really allow their captives to put on a trial? I mean really why would they? Did it ever happen? Its one thing to do a drag show where the enlisted stiffs pretend to be Ann Sheridan and her smokin 45s but . . . this is like a road show production of ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" In fact the real text of ""Harts War"" has nothing to do with World War II and everything to do with World War II (and other) movies Its like a pop quiz in Hollywood history and the answers besides ""Mockingbird"" and the three alluded-to POW classics (""Grand Illusion"" ""Stalag 17"" and the TV series ""Hogans Heroes"") would include every POW movie ever made (the Hauser character is a combination of the William Holden and Peter Graves characters in ""Stalag 17"") of course the fabulous ""Great Escape"" and even such wartime Warner Bros. agitprop extravaganzas as ""Desperate Journey"" where escaping airmen Errol Flynn and Ronnie Reagan had time to blow up a munitions factory before hijacking a plane back to safe territory. A scene where a fellow is executed even as in the background acts of sabotage are carried out in defiance of Nazi orders is straight from the movie version of John Steinbecks ""The Moon Is Down."" The movie is actually much better in its first half than in its second where the genre melding grows awkward. Farrell is Tommy Hart a Yale law student assigned to a cushy staff job behind the lines. Alas the Battle of the Bulge has broken out and there are no lines Hes captured discovers (incidentally) the massacre at Malmedy where the SS machine-gunned a slew of GI prisoners is interrogated and tortured and eventually shipped off to the stalag. There it becomes clear to commanding officer and alpha-wolf McNamara (Willis) that Hart probably gave up a tad more than name rank and serial number. Thus instead of going into the cushy officers barracks hes forced into the prole paradise of the enlisted mens. The director an undistinguished professional named Gregory Hoblit has a good feel for POW culture which may mean he spent his youth as I spent mine watching those old flicks on the tube. And since not much is happening in the plot each actor has enough room to get in his licks and register vividly. Then an hour into Lt. Harts adventures the actual story begins The black aviator Lt. Lincoln Scott is accused of murdering the racist sergeant. Hart is tabbed by McNamara to defend Scott though it seems a slam-dunk Scott was discovered standing next to the body by the German guards; he had motive he had opportunity and he was dirty as if hed been stalking the man through the mud. (It feels authentic that as in many prisons the POWs here have easily managed the elementary task of sneaking out of the buildings at night; they pretty much roam about at will.) Of course for Hart this is a chance at redemption and so he takes it seriously instead of just getting with the program. His investigation eventually leads to a conspiracy. But is it an evil conspiracy or given the context a noble one? As I say everybody in ""Harts War"" is at least professional; the movie grips reasonably like a solid commercial effort for close to two hours until it more or less self-destructs in a ridiculous last few minutes when it becomes a noble sacrifice-o-rama as three men each attempt to place themselves before a Nazi firing squad in order that justice victory the American way of life and melodramatic tidiness may flourish. As Iures elegant SS Maj. Visser might say ""How banal these foolish Americans."" HARTS WAR (R 120 minutes) - contains battle violence and profanity. At area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - Earnest Harts War is a relic from another era Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/15/2002 - Updated 1231 AM ET Earnest Harts War is a relic from another era By Mike Clark USA TODAY Harts War (out of four) Stars Bruce Willis Colin Farrell Terrence Howard Cole Hauser Marcel Iures Linus Roache Director Gregory Hoblit Distributor MGM Rating R for some strong war violence and language Late in World War II and with the German machine crumbling an American colonel and stalag prisoner (Bruce Willis) pulls off a surprising feat He persuades his German counterpart and prison-camp commander (Marcel Iures) to push aside wartime chaos and take part in a murder trial. Based partly on true-life events Harts War is being marketed as an action melodrama. Its not. A lot of what transpires -- especially some high-octane speechifying -- comes off as contrived. The result is an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say the 60s. Read more below Video Watch the Harts War trailer Willis star power may sell the picture but he doesnt even play Hart. Tigerland s Colin Farrell does and hes cast as a guy a POW camp cant do without a former Yale law school student. This comes in handy when two downed black Tuskegee Airmen end up in the camp only to be reminded -- not that they arent every day -- that the Army is segregated. A racist white sergeant makes a ruckus over the impromptu camp integration which leads to one of the fliers deaths and the sergeants almost immediate murder. The surviving flier (Terrence Howard) is naturally the person accused and soon a full-fledged trial is taking place as the German commandant looks on with wry moral superiority. War is directed by Gregory Hoblit who after a stylish feature debut with the luridly compelling Primal Fear fumbled a pair of supernatural duds ( Fallen and Frequency ). Of the four this comes the closest to being an old-school movie for grown-ups well-intentioned neither coarse nor stupid and capably crafted though the washed-out and intentionally unprettifying color wears on the eyes over a 125-minute haul. At a different time (1960s again) Hoblit would have been allowed to shoot in a more visually dynamic black-and-white -- and a long prison-camp movie without much action or humor needs all the dynamism it can get. As the defense lawyer Farrell gets to wax indignant about racism; as the defendant Howard gets to display his escalating range. (A recent fixture of romantic comedies he also played civil rights figure Ralph Abernathy in HBOs Boycott. ) Top-billed or not Willis is a supporting player though his character has an ace up his sleeve. This leads to a late plot twist which (for some) might carry War through a single viewing but its tough to see what it could ever offer anyone on a second. Despite its title and a few misleading explosions in the trailer this is stolid Bruce not funky Bruce. And stolid Bruce may have peaked with The Sixth Sense. As a general rule any movie that credits Willis hairstylist is likely to be an uphill battle especially when you keep asking the person youre with ""Whats that on his head?""

Actor at left is not identified. Photo Credit Murray Clos. HANDOUT. Engaging Harts suffers plot lapses 1 / 1 Back to Gallery HARTS WAR Drama. Starring Bruce Willis Colin Farrell Marcel Iures. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. (R. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). To the relief of many Bruce Willis has stopped smirking. In his past few films however hes adopted an acting style of such facial minimalism that he appears unaware hes being filmed or even that hes conscious. When Willis talks his lips part a fraction of a millimeter. The creases on the sides of his mouth now arouse suspicion. Howd they get on a face that sees such little action? Its a good thing then that Willis doesnt have to carry ""Harts War"" despite his top billing. Hes not Hart but a colonel named McNamara whos in charge of fellow American POWs held by the Germans in the waning days of World War II. Irish actor Colin Farrell plays Hart a young lieutenant. You might remember the darkly handsome Farrell from his 15 seconds as the It Boy before his movies ""Tigerland"" and ""American Outlaws"" bit the dust. In ""Harts War"" he shows he could be the real thing. Though its being charitable to call his Yankee accent wobbly Farrell proves a solid leading man as his character evolves from yellow-bellied rich boy to man of honor. Its the kind of performance for which war movies were invented. Unfortunately for Farrell and for the audience ""Harts War"" contains a fatal structural flaw. A racially charged court-martial that takes up half the picture turns out to be a just a cover. The movies really about something bigger an act of far greater scope and military importance thats telegraphed early on. This serves to distract the viewer who has to keep one eye on the court proceedings and the other on the bigger thing around the corner. ""Harts War"" takes some admirable risks though. First its a war movie without battle scenes or dancing girls -- there are no women at all for that matter -- thats more a character study than a testament to American fortitude. Set almost entirely in the POW camp the movies bleached-out bluish patina makes it look as if it were filmed in black and white at times. A picture this austere almost dares people to come see it. Though characters are archetypical the script by Billy Ray and Terry George from the book by John Katzenbach at least gives them some shading. The heroes are flawed The young lieutenant caves in too quickly to his German inquisitors and the colonel compromises his men to feed his ego. The camps Nazi commander is rendered nearly as human as the Americans. ""Harts War"" embraces plenty of cliches however. The dialogue is generally wooden or hokey -- ""He knew what Id had for breakfast"" Hart says of his inquisitor -- and the conflicts predictable. A faceoff between the grizzled vet and the untried pup is inevitable we know because it always is in this type of movies. They go at it in a military courtroom where the colonel presides over the trial and the lieutenant serves as defense lawyer. When the brash young officer challenges the colonels ethics you almost expect Willis to shout ""You cant handle the truth"" But he would never open his mouth that wide. The case involves a dead racist sergeant (Cole Hauser) and the African American officer (Terrence Howard) who had threatened to kill him. Things grow cloudy when the German commander a Yalie like Hart offers to help the young American with the defense. Marcel Iures lends the Nazi enough slithery charm that you think he could be on the level. The murder itself is a bit of a letdown and not just because of the loss of life. Killing off Hauser (""Pitch Black"") eliminates some juicy possibilities for further showdowns between him and Howard (""Big Mommas House""). Theyre two of the most deliciously slow-burning young actors working today. . This film contains violence raw language.

The television ads for Harts War starring Bruce Willis and his elegant facial furrows would lead you to believe that its yet another in the current righteous wave of exploding-grenade combat epics (""Die Hard With a Venerable Cause?""). Actually ""Harts War"" which takes place during the waning days of World War II is set almost entirely in a German POW camp. Its an old-fashioned movie with a quaintly old-fashioned lesson to teach us. Think ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" as written by the committee to renominate Al Gore. At the beginning theres a token few minutes of graphic battle spectacle as Tommy Hart (Colin Farrell) a fresh-faced young lieutenant who has virtually no experience in the field gets ambushed and captured then herded onto a train and marched through the snow into the camps gates at which point a sneak attack by U.S. bombers graces the moment with a gratuitous crackle of photogenic destruction. Having gotten this action appetizer out of the way the film settles down to its real agenda. Hart due to a space shortage is assigned by the camps ranking American officer a stoic toughie named Col. William McNamara (Willis) to live in a barracks crammed with lowly enlisted men. Farrell whose hair always looks a little too unmussed is a bit glam for the period-war setting but youre drawn to his slightly solemn air of concentration; hes like the worlds most self-possessed Eagle Scout. His gears are churning in even the calmest quietest scenes and thats part of what makes a star. Before long Hart and the other men are joined by a pair of black Air Force pilots led by Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Terrence Howard). These two have fought their way up the ranks of a military establishment that isnt exactly in the business of encouraging black recruits. If they dont say much thats because its clear that their presence isnt welcome. Theyre the odd inmates out especially to Staff Sgt. Vic Bedford (Cole Hauser) a drawling racist who is not the least bit shy about tossing the word nigger around. The moment it popped out of his mouth I flashed back to the shock I felt as a kid in 1967 when Telly Savalas as the repulsive Bible-thumper Maggott used it to insult Jim Brown in ""The Dirty Dozen."" In a strange way a part of me hoped that the new film would feature a comparable spice rack of peppery disreputable characters that maybe we were in for a boisterous update of ""Stalag 17."" ""Harts War"" Im afraid has no such frivolous ambitions. Directed with lots of frozen-breath-in-the-floodlights atmosphere by Gregory Hoblit (""Frequency"" ""Primal Fear"") it is instead a grimly competent and stolid and earnest military courtroom drama. One of the American prisoners is killed in the middle of the night an event that might appear to be terror as usual in a prison camp run by Third Reich goons. Nevertheless Colonel McNamara persuades the commandant Colonel Visser (Marcel Iures) a disarmingly courtly Nazi with whom he has an underground relationship to have a tribunal assembled. Lieutenant Scott who appears to have had a motive for the crime (plus a knife was found under his mattress) is placed on trial for murder and Hart the senators son who was on his way to getting a Yale law degree before the war beckoned is assigned to defend the helpless black soldier. Actually let me rephrase that. What I meant to say is the helpless black soldier who has so much to teach us about courage and tolerance. A movie that bends over backwards to be ""moral"" may reveal its true morality in a way that it didnt intend. When Terrence Howard who was so wily and charming in ""The Best Man"" gets up on the witness stand and gives his big speech the movie doesnt soar - it sags into cliche. ""Harts War"" is structured so that the black man ennobled by his fight against prejudice preaches the lesson of self-sacrifice a credo that ripples out among the white soldiers and allows them to accomplish the real mission behind the trial. Yet whats actually being sacrificed here is the sense that an African-American character need be anything more than a symbol. It may seem harmless to some that our movies have never entirely abandoned the land of Poitier-ville but as ""Harts War"" demonstrates its an insult that they havent. Making do with the occasional work of Spike Lee the annual Oscar bait of an ""Ali"" or ""Monsters Ball"" or Denzel Washington as the anti-Poitier in ""Training Day"" is no longer enough. When it comes to the treatment of race Hollywood despite such exceptions now lags behind the rest of the country trapped in a time warp of its own making brandishing a mantle of tattered liberal sainthood that has never looked more like a chain.
