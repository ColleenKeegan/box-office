Turbo (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) sees his wish come true when a freak accident endows him with amazing speed. He enters the worlds fastest race the Indianapolis 500 to worldwide acclaim - but to the distaste of his idol racing star Guy Gagne. Yes the Indy 500 is a car race its human drivers now competing with a mollusc. If talking snails werent enough its here that Turbo stretches credulity and the more nervously inclined may be worried about him being crushed. But kids should be game for the ride and the colourful characters offer humour and poignancy Paul Giamattis cautious snail Chet shares a sweet friendship with reckless Turbo. Comparisons with Pixars Cars are easy to make but thats no bad thing.

For a film that has attracted a large number of stars and well known supports I was very disappointed. It is neither funny enough or quirky enough to keep kids happy and lacks the more mainstream gags to keep the parents happy. Also dont pay the extra for the 3D. There are lots of flashing lights and neon but nothing much to make the extra cost worthwhile. If I was a parent that had spent PS 50 or more for tickets 3d glasses and refreshments for two adults and 2 kids to see this I would feel robbed. If you must see it wait for a bargain matinee without the 3d. A poor 2 star film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 11 2013owen smithFeaturedI like menFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 11 2013owen smithFeaturedI like menFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/turbo,200,turbo0,turbo,timeout

A happy accident involving a nitrous oxide bath gives Theo near-unlimited speed turning him into Turbo the snail who gets a spot in the Indy 500. Photo Dream Works Animation Twentieth Century Fox Turbo review In this race watch the escargot 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Turbo Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Ryan Reynolds Paul Giamatti and Michael Pena. Directed by David Soren. (PG. 96 minutes.) There are good reasons why we dont see a lot of gastropods as protagonists in family movies. -- Snails dont have hands or feet limiting an animator to just eye and mouth movements for expressiveness. -- Snails are pests that interfere with the human food chain resulting in a take-it-or-leave-it approach to rooting for their survival. -- If they come in contact with salt youre looking at an immediate PG-13 rating. The makers of ""Turbo"" give the snail-competing-in-the-Indy-500 genre a hell of a try. The animated adventure has some of the stranger moments of the summer movie season - and thats after Russell Crowe saddled up a giant dragonfly in ""Man of Steel."" But after the originality of the hero the filmmakers borrow too heavily from other movies; the similarities to ""Ratatouille"" and ""Cars"" are almost distracting. The ""Turbo"" mantra of ""No dream is too big no dreamer is too small"" could apply to at least half of the kid-friendly films released in the last year. There are too many characters and too much action as if the filmmakers couldnt trust their young audience to stay focused on the story. Turbo (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) is a snail who wants to go fast; the Ricky Bobby of garden pests. The early scenes of snails harvesting a tomato garden have an appropriately unnerving quality. One surprise among the three screenwriters is ""The Wrestler"" and ""Big Fan"" scribe Robert D. Siegel. (Were guessing he was behind the running joke where a bird swoops in and ruthlessly snatches up hapless snails at random intervals.) After the happy accident involving a nitrous oxide bath that gives Theo near-unlimited speed the snail befriends two human brothers working out of a taco truck who have a makeshift family (and potential sponsors) in their strip mall neighbors. A team of hot-rod-racing snails shows up presumably as an excuse to add Snoop Dogg and Samuel L. Jackson to the voice cast. And because we need a bad guy - and why not make him French? - elite racer Guy Gagne (voiced by Bill Hader) tries to crush the racing snail. ""Turbo"" comes from DreamWorks Animation which is developing a reputation for memorably offbeat characters. From the super villain with a heart of gold in ""Megamind"" to ""The Penguins of Madagascar"" the films have a subversive streak but also a core of plaintive sensitivity. Taco moguls Angelo (Luis Guzman) and Tito (Michael Pena) are the most fully formed characters struggling with their business but remaining unconditionally loyal to each other. Even if you dont care about the snails you want good things to happen to them. The movie is so derivative in so many ways that youll start to think the nods are on purpose. When Turbos human friends show up as the pit crew theyre wearing T-shirts with the exact same typeface as the Cutters in ""Breaking Away."" The intended preteen target demographic for ""Turbo"" will not question the logic of a snail being allowed in the Indy 500 so well try not to spoil the fun. But its worth noting that ""Cars"" looks like a Ken Burns documentary next to this film. Five hundred laps and not a single car thought to crush the snail under a tire? For the sequel wed also like to see Ortho Pest Control as a sponsor. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Grade B+ ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" could be the theme song for ""Turbo."" In this energetic funny cartoon about a plucky garden snail (Ryan Reynolds) the star belongs to the neon sign on a Van Nuys strip mall Starlight Plaza. This rundown shopping center is where our hero who calls himself Turbo leaps into his lifelong fantasy of entering the Indianapolis 500 - not some mollusk version of the race but the actual open-wheel competition. His shell will be his chariot. The latest film from DreamWorks Animation draws on several hits by rival Pixar (""Cars"" ""A Bugs Life"" ""Ratatouille"" even ""WALL-E""). But it tells an Impossible Dream fable all its own. Its as classical as ""Pinocchio"" and as contemporary as ""Fast amp; Furious 6."" Turbo decides he wants to be an Indycar champ after watching racing tapes on a TV/VCR gathering dust in a garage. The snail doesnt stand a chance until he falls into the engine of a drag-racing car and becomes so saturated with nitrous oxide that he acquires super speed. To reach Indianapolis he still needs the help of Tito (Michael Pena) the food-truck driver for the ""Dos Bros Tacos"" food stand. Tito aims to prove Turbos mettle and use the publicity to put his brothers Mexican cooking on the map along with the rest of Starlight Plaza. ""Turbo"" exudes warmth humor and ingenuity right from the beginning when Turbo and his brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) toil at ""the plant"" - the tomato plant harvested by a colony of snails. In the best and most jolting running joke a crow abruptly swoops in and seizes a worker and the survivors casually shrug off each loss. Turbo though refuses to accept his brothers fate after a crow snatches him he uses his newfound super-power to rescue Chet. Like the best turns in the movie its a test of character tied to a plot twist. The siblings crash onto a Van Nuys street. Tito scoops them up and introduces them to an improbable stable of streetwise racing snails voiced by Samuel L. Jackson Maya Rudolph Snoop Dogg Ben Schwartz and Mike Bell. They compete on a small toy track. To them its as big as the Grand Prix. In director/cowriter David Sorens wittiest stroke Turbo and Chet land in a twinned comic universe. Tito races his normal yet gutsy and determined snails for the delight of his Starlight Plaza neighbors the owners of the hobby shop (Richard Jenkins) the garage (Michelle Rodriguez) and the nail parlor (Ken Jeong). Titos brother Angelo (Luis Guzman) despairs of Titos whimsical ways just as Chet pooh-poohs Turbos wish for racing immortality. But the other shop owners back Tito in every way just as Titos invertebrate stable gets Turbo to ""snail up."" Soren and his cowriters Robert Siegel (""The Fighter"" ""Big Fan"") and Darren Lemke (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") draw amusing parallels between the human and gastropod worlds sometimes within single shots as when all four brothers play out their conflicts on radically different scales. (The snails can hear and understand the humans not vice-versa.) The contrast in perspective is hilarious especially when Soren cuts between the average snails perception of their speed - and the sluggish reality. ""Turbo"" is a modest movie. Our snail doesnt need to overcome temptation the way Pinocchio did. But its mollusks-eye-view gives the film a delightful angle on the world. And Turbo is no mere underdog - hes part superhero part dark horse. Titos racing snails show Turbo that talent alone isnt enough to win he also needs grit and inventiveness. Whats more they teach him that to win a mans race like the Indy 500 he must run it like a snail - a clever riff on how subcultures can succeed in America without sacrificing their identities. Its fun to see sports-film cliches - like a family reunion near the finish line - acted out by characters with twisty eye stalks and long slimy bodies they can ""tuck and roll"" inside a shell. The antic visual invention never lets up whether Tito is tucking Turbo in at night with a ketchup packet as a pillow and a warm tortilla as a blanket or the racing snails serving as his Indy 500 pit crew using a vibrating cell phone to massage Turbos foot. Bill Haders killer voice performance as Turbos human idol Guy Gagne a self-regarding French Canadian racing champ gives the whole third act a huge comedic lift. The five-time Indy 500 winner is asked what keeps him driving and in Haders drollest accent and cadences Guy responds ""When a cheetah chases after a gazelle does he ever stop to think maybe Ive caught enough gazelles?"" Hes counting on just another gazelle. What Guy gets is far more competitive and dangerous -- a spunky little turbo-charged snail.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The Little Engine That Could the plucky little dynamo who beats the odds by believing in herself gets a radical remake in ""Turbo"" the story of a high-revving snail who enters the Indianapolis 500. This riff on the classic tale delivers the upbeat message that with the right attitude (and some magic) even a mollusk can overcome obstacles physical environmental and emotional to land in the winners circle. The hyperactive new DreamWorks film is a reminder that Pixar once shorthand for animation excellence has been losing ground. DreamWorks (""Madagascar"" ""How to Train Your Dragon"" ""Kung-Fu Panda"" and ""The Croods"") cant top the polished virtuosity of the Disney subsidiarys finest work but it has consistently outshined Pixars less inspired releases. This ode to white-line fever runs rings around ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2."" By day Theo the snail (Ryan Reynolds) works a spirit-sapping job at ""the Plant."" That would be the tomato plant in a Los Angeles tract homes garden patch. Hes fussed over by his protective persnickety brother Chet (Paul Giamatti). Hes regularly slimed by overripe tomatoes. Hes bored up to his eyestalks by the sluggish pace. ""The sooner you accept the dull miserable nature of your existence the happier youll be"" Chet counsels. After dark Theos imagination cranks into overdrive. Watching old car-racing tapes on the humans TV he dreams of becoming Turbo the planets fastest snail. Inspired by the positive-thinking creed of his human hero champion racer Guy Gagne (Bill Hader with a French-Canadian accent thicker than maple syrup) Turbo dreams of glory at the Indy 500. As Guy says ""No dream is too big and no dreamer too small."" Feed Loader Theo the snail is voiced by Ryan Reynolds. When Turbo is sucked into a street racers carburetor the nitrous oxide that supercharges the engine amps up our little heros horsepower. Suddenly hes faster than a flash and instead of slime trails hes leaving sizzling exhaust contrails of neon-blue light in his path. Escar-go. His potential catches the eye of tubby taco-truck driver Tito (Michael Pena) who tries to use his remarkable abilities to draw tourists to the rundown strip mall that is his home base. His more grounded brother Angelo (Luis Guzman) is as much a buzz kill as Chet telling Tito to ditch his impractical schemes and concentrate on taco transportation. But with the help of a gaggle of sassy snails (a stupendous supporting cast led by Samuel L. Jackson Snoop Dogg and Maya Rudolph) and mall shopkeepers (Michelle Rodriguez Richard Jenkins and a priceless Ken Jeong) the go-go gastropod is soon Indiana-bound. Thanks to what fans of animal-themed sports movies call the ""Air Bud Loophole"" (the rules dont say an animal cant play) Turbo is soon revving up at the starting line. Guy proves much less sporting in person than he appears on TV however and the competitors uncontrolled spinouts and treacherous rubber patches from shredded tires make for a thundering dangerous race. In the end both Guy and Turbo are locked in a grueling battle of millimeters. Oddly for a racing film ""Turbo"" is not as fast on its feet as one would wish. Does it make sense to say that the jokes are fine but there are too many of them? Its an SUV of a film awash with chrome details spinny wheels and irrational running lights. Theres a ton of filigree in the story line repetitive plotting and characters enough to keep us in first gear when we should be sprinting ahead. And the moral of the piece gets a little blurry when our underdog hero triumphs because of his Lance Armstrong-like performance enhancers. Mom and Dad prepare for a teachable moment explaining that. Still theres plenty of good stuff under the hood. The script has a nice sense of sports savvy (Robert Siegel writer of ""The Wrestler"" and ""Big Fan"" take a bow) and the ace voice cast makes a dozen colorful characters come alive. The animation has a luminous look (cinematographer Wally ""Dark Knight"" Pfister consulted) and Henry Jackmans score is addictively bouncy. The multicultural vibe is enjoyable and theres a mildly risque gag concerning Michelle Rodriguezs grease-monkey auto shop owner and the less said about it the better. So some stitches show. ""Turbo"" isnt a perfect cartoon but its so likable that like its humble hero you have to root for it.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Turbo (center played by Ryan Reynolds) and the Racing Snails race to glory. (DreamWorks Animation) By Jen Chaney July 16 2013 Follow chaneyj For anyone whos ever watched a ""Fast and the Furious"" movie and thought ""You know this would be better if it were a cartoon about snails"" DreamWorks Animation presents ""Turbo."" Wait wait. Thats a little unfair. Yes this triumph of speed over slime trails borrows some elements from that Vin Diesel action franchise. Its got a drag race. Nitrous oxide pumps through its plot. Even Michelle Rodriguez Diesels recently resurrected girlfriend from the ""Fast"" flicks provides one of the voices. But really ""Turbo"" feels more like a hybrid of Pixars ""Cars"" and every family-friendly tale from ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" to ""Monsters University"" that champions the outsize dreams of underdog underachievers. None of which by the way detracts from its charms. ""Turbo"" is a derivative but nevertheless good-hearted movie thats peppered with enough clever touches to engage adults as well as moviegoers of the smaller squirmier variety. And during a season when moms dads and nannies often struggle to keep kids occupied theres something to be said for having an entertaining alternative to seeing ""Despicable Me 2"" for the fourth time. The star of this show is Theo (voice of Ryan Reynolds) a snail with his shell in the dirt but his itty-bitty gelatinous head in the clouds. Theo is obsessed with auto racing and determined -- against all odds logic and the persistent naysaying of his older brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) -- to compete in a legitimate speedway event. His wish steers closer to reality after hes snatched from his garden home by a crow dropped near Highway 101 and eventually knocked onto a sports car in mid-street-race where he gets injected with enough nitro to make him worthy of a segment on ""Top Gear."" Theo arrives at a strip mall in Van Nuys Calif. where he competes in an underground snail-racing ring and convinces an equally idealistic taco shop employee (Michael Pena) that he possesses the jaw-dropping velocity needed to compete in the Indianapolis 500. Its easy to guess where the ride goes from here. Still the impressive heard-but-not-seen actors in this cast -- among them Samuel L. Jackson Maya Rudolph and Bill Hader as Guy Gagne the narcissistic French driver who initially embraces the opportunity to compete against a tricked-out piece of escargot -- infuse the narrative with enough comic energy to partially forgive its predictable trajectory. Theres something especially endearing in the way Giamatti brings whiffs of the apoplectically judgmental characters hes played in movies like ""Sideways"" to his stocky little oozer. ""Turbo"" also deserves credit for its inventive depiction of its snail-dominated world. Before their foray into racing Theo and Chet work at The Plant which is literally the plant a web of backyard vines where their fellow slowpokes put in eight hours daily foraging away on ripe tomatoes. And when Penas Tito adopts Theo he sets him up in style on a cushy napkin-holder bed with a taco sauce packet for a pillow and a tortilla for a blanket. Moments like these brim with more imagination frankly than weve seen in some of the recent Pixar pictures. And that should be enough to make most moviegoers perfectly content to spend 98 minutes with the plucky little souped-up slug that thinks he can. Chaney is a freelance writer. Turbo 1/2 (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some mild action and thematic elements. lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Wednesday July 17 2013 200 AM Title Turbo Film Info PG. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. Families who have already raced to ""Monsters University"" and ""Despicable Me 2"" will find ""Turbo"" an acceptable third-place finisher. A sort-of escargot-meets-""Cars"" adventure it has some sharp vocal turns and remains fun even when its inventiveness runs out of gas. Theo (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) is a garden snail whose dull life in a suburban Los Angeles flower bed isnt what he wants. The bug who calls himself ""Turbo"" idolizes a French racecar driver named Guy Gagne (Bill Hader with an over-the-top accent ) and dreams of going fast. But Turbos big brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) leads the tsk-tsk ing about his big hopes -- that is until an accidental infusion of nitrous oxide from a roadster enters Turbos system. Then he becomes a tiny speedster and with the help of a taco stand worker named Tito (Michael Pena) he enters the Indy 500 on his way to glory. Convoluted as its plot sounds the script for ""Turbo"" -- co-written by veterans of ""Shrek Forever After"" ""Shark Tale"" and the satirical newspaper the Onion -- is amazingly agile. Even the movies target audience of boys aged 7-10 may appreciate how easily Turbo travels from a tomato-filled garden to an L.A. freeway to Indianapolis. The filmmakers also learned well the lessons of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy. When Turbo meets Titos other racing snails -- including the take-charge leader Whiplash (a bombastic Samuel L. Jackson) -- they dont talk with humans. Yet the melding of their world with Titos community at a Van Nuys strip mall is fairly seamless. The voice work here keeps pace. Reynolds who cant catch a break when it comes to live-action flicks has a light eager tone. Giamatti is droll fun as the disapproving older brother and Jackson is at his best. This little family flicks message about never giving up on your dreams is basic -- but it may come up fast on young audiences. ""Turbo"" addresses it nicely and never feels sluggish.

That tardy specimen from ""Monsters University"" is probably still huffing and puffing to make it to class. And now comes DreamWorks 3-D confection ""Turbo"" featuring Ryan Reynolds as a garden-trolling slowpoke who dreams of Indianapolis 500 glory.

"Turbo a predictable snail tale review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTurbo a predictable snail tale reviewRyan Reynolds voices the lead in animated tale about a feisty snail who dreams of the Indy 500.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. July 17 2013TurboStarring the voices of Ryan Reynolds Paul Giamatti Bill Hader Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Pena. Directed by David Soren. 96 minutes. Opens July 17 at major theatres. GAn animated tale of a feisty snail who dreams of putting the ""go"" in escargot with a run at the Indianapolis 500 Turbo probably wont win the summer animations sweepstakes but neither does it crash and burn.Article Continued BelowTheo the garden snail voiced by Canadas Ryan Reynolds is an ambitious little crawler who strains and trains to break his 17-minute ""speed"" record on a three-foot-long racetrack. Hes even given himself an ambitious nickname to add inspiration Turbo.Turbo is an outsider at The Plant (literally) a tomato patch where other snails are content to munch veggie spoils and leave sticky trails under the watchful stalked eyes of safety supervisor Chet (Paul Giamatti in a bit of genius casting) who cautions about threats from crows above and a nasty tricycle-riding kid below.Turbos hero-worship of French Canadian egomaniac Indy champ Guy Gagne (Saturday Night Lives Bill Hader curiously sounding more like Antonio Banderas) borders on obsession. Chet who disapproves of risks almost as much as he does fanciful dreams of glory reminds his brother that he needs to keep his slimy foot on the ground and his head out of the clouds.A meet-up with a street racers nitrous oxide fuel tank magically transforms Turbo into a spiral-shelled fireball. Finding himself far from The Plant he teams up with fellow dreamer and Dos Bros Taco food truck driver Tito (Michael Pena) and his fine field of street-smart racing snails.Tito has a dream-doubting sibling of his own Angelo (Luis Guzman) the other half of Dos Bros Tacos which is struggling along with the other businesses at a rundown Van Nuys strip mall. But Tito knows he can take his spiral-shelled Rocky all the way to the Indy with the financial help of the malls ragtag bunch of business owners voiced with hammy enthusiasm by Richard Jenkins Michelle Rodriguez and Ken Jeong.There are several funny bits in the script by Torontos David Soren(writing along with Darren Lemke and Robert Siegel) who also directs. Ever wonder how snails applaud? Youll get your answer here. The snail racers headed by stern Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson) is more a ""collect all five"" cry for a kiddie meal product placement than memorable characters although there is an amusing running gag with a corpulent snail who fancies himself the mysterious White Shadow (Michael Patrick Bell). Snoop Dog Ben Schwartz and Maya Rudolph voice the rest of the wisecracking mollusc clan.The story has some obvious parallels with previous animated flicks most notably Disneys Cars franchise but Turbo doesnt earn the same likability points as more fleshed-out characters like Lightning McQueen and lovable lug Mater. Turbos colourful trek to product placement-littered Indianapolis is as rote as it gets but little viewers wont care about predictability. And while the exciting track scenes -- three-time Indy winner Dario Franchitti was the main racing consultant -- will get audiences in the speedy groove initially things do wear on a bit. Even though our story is about snails must it take so long to get where we know its going?The year of the snailHollywood seems to be falling for snails this year with the molluscs getting a surprising amount of onscreen time. Theres even a fanciful drawing of a snail on the fridge in Adam Sandlers Grown Ups 2 which opened July 12.Heres a trio of 2013 summer films with snail starsTurbo The title character in the animated story of a little snail who dreams of entering the Indianapolis 500 plus a huge cast of supporting snails voiced by Paul Giamatti Samuel L. Jackson Snoop Dogg and Maya Rudolph among them.Monsters University A bit part that gets a big laugh A determined snail student with a purple backpack groans ""I cant be late for the first day"" and then goes nowhere fast.Epic Chris ODowd voices Mub a wisecracking snail who partners with Grub a slug who fancies himself a ladies man (Aziz Ansari) and the pair but slither off with the picture.Linda BarnardThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review In Turbo super-charged snail goes on fun ride to Indy 500 - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review In Turbo super-charged snail goes on fun ride to Indy 500 Turbo Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Turbo starring Ryan Reynolds. Video by Jason H. Neubert Betsy Sharkey reviews Turbo starring Ryan Reynolds. Video by Jason H. Neubert Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic There are underdogs. And there are underdogs. Then there is ""Turbo"" a garden snail who dreams of winning the Indy 500.Honestly they pretty much had me at ""racing snails."" The idea for animations latest 3-D event movie sounded absurd enough to provide fertile visual terrain the vroom vroom grit of Indy racing action the Garden of Eden lushness of tomato vine crawling. There is the general shape of all things snail as well the shell the slime those antennae eyes. And who knew about the goofy grins?Thats before we even get to Turbos impossible dreams ones that can be so easily crushed. Squish. PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsA hesitant hand-wringing older brother named Chet ensures theres plenty of sibling conflict to chew on. And a series of strong emotional crosscurrents tied to the notion of winning and losing are in the hands of a very eclectic and capable cast -- the ever-charming Ryan Reynolds charismatic as Turbo and often-irritating Paul Giamatti fretting as Chet to start.But really ""racing snails"" is one of those two-word combos that suggests cleverly subversive minds behind the wheel.The idea was initially David Sorens who directs and co-writes with Darren Lemke (""Shrek Forever After"") and Robert D. Siegel (a former editor in chief of the Onion). Soren has spent a few years in the animation trenches -- head of story on ""Shark Tale"" directing ""Madagascars"" TV holiday special. Making his feature directing debut only 10 years after he first had the idea means Soren is on a pretty fast track at least in the animated world which has so many pace parallels to Turbos. The story itself grew out of Sorens own snail problem and a sons love of fast cars. Still the movies themes of dreams and brothers are pretty basic ones. A few well-observed cultural riffs a la ""Shrek"" and a smattering of Onion-styled satire help to juice up the old tropes.The film begins with a sense of Turbos obsession. His own speed trials are a hoot. But its the eyes glued to the TV as French Canadian racing champ Guy Gagne (Bill Hader) wins another Indy that suggests how multi-layered things are going to get.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 The grown-ups can thank some of the spot-on voice casting for a good deal of ""Turbos"" adult amusement. Has there ever been a nasal so born to nag as Giamattis? Meanwhile Hader drips arrogance. And we havent even gotten to the streetwise snails. Whiplash (Samuel L. Jackson) Smoove Move (Snoop Dogg) Burn (Maya Rudolph) Skidmark (Ben Schwartz) and White Shadow (Michael Patrick Bell) bring considerable swagger.The garden where all things begin might look like paradise -- the animation certainly brings out the leafy beauty of the well-watered L.A. life. But there are hazards aplenty Gardener Day the maniac moppet on a trike and the dreaded crows.But soon Turbo leaves the garden behind and the adventure really begins. A drag race that Turbo gets unexpectedly sucked into -- literally -- and an accidental nitrous oxide infusion changes the young snails fundamental chemistry (so parents need not fear Lance Armstrong or juiced athlete overtones). Suddenly all the speed Turbo wanted is at his command but power comes with a price and that becomes one of the movies many arcs.It will also take Turbo into other worlds. Primarily Van Nuys. Which is funny enough if you know Los Angeles. Regardless the squabbling sibs of Dos Bros Tacos -- Tito (Michael Pena) and Angelo (Luis Guzman) -- take care of any worries that a snails journey might not be enough.One of the movies more amusing conceits is its complete integration of the snail and human communities. Mollusks and people seem to understand each other -- it just happens. And except for a minor dust-up over rules why or how a snail can compete alongside Indy drivers is never an issue. It is however a lot of fun.The journey to the Indy 500 is not without is major bumps. It helps that Tito and Turbos big dreams happen to coincide. Titos been convinced that snail racing can save the Starlight Plaza where the brothers taco stand languishes.The strip mall makes for a nice little bit of nostalgia that like everything else the animation details beautifully. It has a hobby shop run by Bobby (Richard Jenkins) an auto repair shop headed by Paz (""Fast amp; Furious"" Michelle Rodriguez) and one of those ubiquitous nail salons with an acerbic owner named Kim-Ly (Ken Jeong claiming hes channeling his mother-in-law). But the snails are the main attraction. Between their tricked-out shells -- and their attitude -- they should draw crowds. But they havent yet.The film takes a little longer than it should to get everybody to Indianapolis but thats a minor quibble. Because once we get there the Indy 500 is wonderfully wild. There are so many ways to crash and smash the cars as they roar around the track. And for a snail even a super-charged one -- you cannot imagine the perils the pitfalls the pit crews ...Thankfully there is plenty of animation wizardry to take care of that for you.

Recent animated fare it borrows from includes Cars Ratatouille and A Bugs Life minus Pixars witty charm.Turbo nee Theo is amiably voiced by Ryan Reynolds. Hed rather watch pro car races than slime around with his fellow mollusks. The object of some scorn Turbo is nothing like the snails he shares a yard with particularly his downbeat worrywart older brother Chet (Paul Giamatti). ""The sooner you accept the dull miserable nature of your existence the happier youll be"" Chet tells his little bro as he and the rest of their snail brethren devote their energy to sabotaging a patch of tomatoes. Theirs is a fear-based society. When danger looms a snail leader yells out ""tuck and roll"" and these slugs with a shell narrowly avoid death by leaf blower lawn mower or bicycle.Turbo is urged to accept his limitations. But of course we can be assured he wont do any such thing. Though hardly known for their speed Turbo longs to be the fastest snail the world has known. His dreams seem mere fantasies until he has a freak accident that puts him closer to his goal.Turbo gets caught up in a drag race that combines elements of Grease and the Fast amp; Furious movies.Somehow little Turbo gets mixed up in a car engine. Despite his fragility it doesnt destroy him but makes him stronger. Suddenly he can speed around at maximum velocity. This magical prowess seems to derive from having ingested performance-enhancing fumesThe humble garden snail winds up competing in the Indy 500 bolstered by the enthusiastic encouragement of his new buddy Tito appealingly voiced by Michael Pena. It turns out that Tito and Turbo have more in common than names that begin with T. Tito the entrepreneurial co-owner of Dos Bros Tacos also has a naysaying dream-dashing older brother Angelo (Luis Guzman). Titos taco business becomes Turbos sponsor at the race. Along for the ride are other small-business owners in Tito and Angelos struggling strip mall Michelle Rodriguez as Paz Ken Jeong as Kim-Ly and Richard Jenkins as Bobby.Turbo has a likable array of voices that chime in without saying much in the form of fellow racers including Samuel Jackson as Whiplash Snoop Dogg as Burn and Maya Rudolph as Smooth Move. Turbos all-time hero the swaggering IndyCar Series star Guy Gagne (Bill Hader) turns out to be his major nemesis on the track.Some of the 3-D effects particularly during races amp up the derivative story and the animation is well-rendered.The message of shooting big (no matter how small you are) and never letting others shoot down your dreams is valid though hardly original.While it may not attract as many millions of minions now that Despicable Me is played out family audiences might be ready for a revved-up snails pace.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Turbo the snail wants to live life in the fast lane. When a radioactive reaction grants him his wish he sets his sights on the Indy 500. The makers of ""Madagascar"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"" show how far a little fella can go with faith and fortune.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A common garden snail enters the Indianapolis 500. BOTTOM LINE Its tough to overlook the tortured premise but there are some nice moments and commendable messages in this kid-appropriate animated movie. CAST Voices of Ryan Reynolds Paul Giamatti Michael Pena LENGTH 136 When it comes to animated movies all the good ideas and even the not-so-good ones seem to have been taken. The rat who becomes a chef the supervillain who turns good the zoo animals stuck in the wild -- theyve been done. How about a snail who enters the Indianapolis 500? Because snails are slow and race cars are fast get it? All right so youre not bowled over. Nevertheless ""Turbo"" has just enough heart to make it to the winners circle. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Like its hero ""Turbo"" gets off to an achingly slow start. The film takes too long establishing its parallel world in which snails are beaten-down workers at a tomato garden called The Plant. Theo (the voice of Ryan Reynolds) is the misfit with a need for speed; his older brother Chet (an excellent Paul Giamatti) tries to impart wisdom. ""The sooner you accept the dull miserable reality of your existence"" Chet says ""the happier youll be."" In a mishap that borrows a page from ""Spider-Man"" Theo is transformed into Turbo with headlight eyes and the ability to push the 200 mph mark. But the story still hasnt begun First we must meet the daydreaming Tito (Michael Pena) who works at Dos Bros Tacos with his pessimistic older brother Angelo (Luis Guzman). A snail-racing hobbyist Tito makes quite a discovery in Turbo. Things get even more cluttered by several other racing snails (Samuel L. Jackson Snoop Lion Maya Rudolph and others) who look and talk like the ""Fast amp; Furious"" cast. Underneath all the chatter though ""Turbo"" delivers a message worth hearing. ""No dream is too big and no dreamer too small"" says the French Canadian racing champ Guy Gagne (Bill Hader). As you might guess Gagne turns out to be an espresso-sucking jerk but his words still ring true. 232 MoviesTurbo trailer ""Turbo"" deserves credit for its multiracial characters (its set in ethnically diverse Van Nuys Calif.) for occasionally sharp direction by David Soren and for casting Ken Jeong as the voice of Kim-Ly a cranky woman. The climactic race sequence can be a little queasy-making given the squishy possibilities but its also a fairly rousing closer to the film. Its hard not to root this little gastropod over the finish line. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A common garden snail enters the Indianapolis 500.

Because when you really think about it more imagination exists in animation than in traditional narrative filmmaking - as in when was the last time a non-animated movie attempted a protagonist taken away by balloons? Or training a pet dragon? In fairness the constraints of physical reality are clearly the reason for this but its still interesting to note especially because the premise of ""Turbo"" while at first blush seeming silly ends up in fact being pretty great. To wit a talking snail wants to compete in the Indianapolis 500 squaring off against open-wheel racers rocketing around the track at speeds in excess of 200mph. Clearly this is insane. Snails are slow small and havent ever competed for fame and glory. But this kernel of an idea is no more crazy than a snail talking or a snail working a shift down at the tomato-eating plant (and then watching television at night). For ""Turbo"" if the entire world is based in a stable unreality youve got to tip your cap and see what theyve got to offer. In the case of this film the answer is ""plenty"". Because the main character Theo later nicknamed ""Turbo"" (and voiced by Ryan Reynolds) is a snail that gets to live out his dreams. And that ultimately is what family films are all about showing kids its okay to believe in the unbelievable to expand your imagination and that dreams come true all the time. ""Turbo"" is not ""Cars 3"". Though thats an easy comparison to make it is also a flimsy one as one film has talking cars while the other has a snail that wants to race against cars. If cars are the common denominator then we might as well throw in ""Fast and Furious"" to the conversation as ""Turbo"" has far more in common with that film in terms of the love of pure speed nitrous and sticking it to the man. ""Turbo"" really is its own movie in terms of premise and a very solid one at that. In fact ""Turbo"" is the best animation Ive seen since last years ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and it smartly displays a similar level of innovation. The animation industry as a whole seems to be in great shape because Pixar is no longer the only studio putting out ambitious films Dreamworks and Fox have joined them at the table not to mention Disneys support of Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away"") leading to some of the most interesting narratives in decades. Particular credit must be given to Samuel L. Jacksons voicing of Whiplash and Paul Giamattis work on the voice of Chet. The chemistry between the two is awesome hilarious even as Whiplash is an advocate for Turbos dreams while Chet is Turbos wet-blanket brother. I laughed a couple dozen times during the 96 minutes that ""Turbo"" played a rare feat for a film aimed squarely at families. While the films final passages does devolve into some rather artificial tension it has nevertheless built up enough momentum by that point that such a temporary application of the brakes isnt too jarringly terrible. Perhaps the oddest thing about ""Turbo"" is the death toll. Much of it made me laugh because it was handled in a slapstick manner but when youve got snails being taken away by crows (and a fellow snail saying ""Thats a shame"") or crows getting hit by busses well you may be setting up some uncomfortable conversations for parents. Gallows humor is funny I just wonder about the appropriateness for a younger crowd that doesnt even grasp what the gallows are. Could it be this element was placed in solely for the adults to enjoy? Potentially yes and its appreciated though hopefully missed by everyone else. Other than that there are very few tonal complaints to be had here. The film also manages to largely (though not completely) eschew the ""villain"" angle thats become so tiring in modern storytelling instead mostly making the film about Turbos journey (and his journey is fast and fun). ""Turbo"" is the sort of film that should work extremely well for folks who are interested in it. It lives up to expectations even often exceeding them though its a shame its unlikely to find much of a cross-over audience. Though the premise and perhaps the marketing hasnt convinced any new people to give it a try its no less a movie for that snap judgment. ""Turbo"" is an easy recommendation well-considered and well-executed a treat for anyone who likes comedy or ambitious takes on make-believe worlds. SCORE 8.5 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and would love to race a snail.

Chastised for his race-car dreams by curmudgeonly brother Chet (Paul Giamatti) Turbo nabs a farfetched shot at Indianapolis 500 glory after he winds up at a local taco stand and befriends Tito (Michael Pena) a kindred dreamer whose fanciful future plans are similarly put down by a pragmatic sibling (Luis Guzman). David Sorens story peddles rote messages about believing in yourself and seizing the day all while adhering to convention at every hairpin turn be it a cast of comedic-relief sidekicks (voiced by among others Samuel L. Jackson and Snoop Dogg) or an arrogant villain in Turbos idol-cum-rival Guy Gagne (Bill Hader). Among this illustrious voice cast only Giamatti stands out bringing an exasperated protectiveness and anxiety to the otherwise sunshiny-bright proceedings which exhibit scant interest in drumming up any sense of danger or dread. Content to be merely cheerfully cliched its an assembly-line kids film that unlike its daring protagonist risks little and thus reaps only modest rewards.Follow VoiceFilmClub Film Details Turbo RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time96 min.

DreamWorks Animation scores its first winner in years with ""Turbo a fresh fast and funny little fable about a freakishly fast garden snail who tries to enter the Indy 500. Modest by the cartoon studios usual overblown standards this charmer focuses on its very appealing title hero -- winningly voiced by Ryan Reynolds-- who worships a French-Canadian driver (Bill Hader sounding more than a little like Antonio Banderas at times) on TV and fantasizes about competing in the venerable car race. This impossible dream becomes a tiny bit more possible when Turbo gets sucked into an engine during a Los Angeles drag race -- and emerges infused with nitrous oxide that enables him to become the first snail ever to be clocked at more than 200 mph. This phenomenon is first noticed by Tito (Michael Pena) a taco truck driver who first enters Turbo in a snail race then decides he would be an ideal vehicle to promote the struggling Dos Bros Tacos which he operates with his more practical brother Angelo (Luis Guzman). If Angelo is less taken with this idea Turbos own worrywart brother Chet (Paul Giamatti who expertly voices the comic heavy lifting here) is apoplectic about his younger siblings new career. Turbo (center voiced by Ryan Reynolds) gathers a fast-paced teamfor his pit crew at the Indy 500. That goes triple when the endlessly enthusiastic Tito somehow convinces the other business owners (Richard Jenkins Michelle Rodriguez Ken Jeong) in a Van Nuys strip mall to join Dos Bros Tacos in sponsoring Turbos trip to Indianapolis. Also along for the trip are a handful of customized racing snails -- voiced by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson Snoop Dogg and Maya Rudolph -- who serve as Turbos pit crew and cheerleading squad. First Tito has to convince race organizers to accept Turbo as an entry. And then our tiny hero has to avoid getting squished by the other competitors. And thats only for starters. RELATED HOW THE CREATORS OF ""TURBO"" PULLED IT OFF Lets just say there are no surprises here and thats not necessarily a bad thing in a film thats aimed mostly at the under-10 set. Mercifully the characters and the comedy are just sophisticated enough to keep their minders from drifting off. DreamWorks has often indulged in pointless stunt casting of celebrities for its animated features (Angelina Jolie Jerry Seinfeld Chris Rock) but here it works Reynolds Turbo is a delight and Pena comes close to stealing the show as the big-hearted Tito. Director David Soren nicely stages the action -- the races are exciting but not overwhelming -- and the script he collaborated on with Darren Lemke and Robert Siegel creates more well-rounded and less stereotypical characters than often seen in DreamWorks features. Its an unusually sharp-looking animated film with Oscar-winning cinematographer Wally Pfister (""Inception) serving as a visual consultant. Ive not been much of a fan of DreamWorks Animation which (with the notable exception of the first Oscar-winning ""Shrek) has been lacking in artistic ambitions -- despite the stewardship of Jeffrey Katzenberg who revived Disneys toons with classics like ""Beauty and the Beast and ""The Lion King. Since Disney purchased DWAs classier longtime rival Pixar though Pixar and Disneys work has become increasingly indistinguishable from DreamWorks more formulaic star-driven and crass animated features. ""Turbo actually looks pretty good compared to Pixars recent mediocre ""Monsters University"" -- not to mention a long line of DWA horrors like ""Megamind and ""Madagascar."" ""Turbo was the second movie that I took my 31/2-year-old granddaughter Kaya to see in a theater. She was more enthusiastic than during ""Despicable Me 2 even though she pointedly refused to wear the 3-D glasses during our screening of ""Turbo. Parents take note.

"Turbo 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Turbo 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Director David Soren.Cast Ryan Reynolds Paul Giamatti Samuel L. Jackson.Rating PG for some mild action and thematic elements. RELATED NEWS IndyCar Series hopes for boost from Turbo movie By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Jul 16 2013 840 AM ""Turbo"" is a perfectly serviceable animated film not horrible not great about a surprising underdog. But isnt comfortably residing somewhere in the middle kind of a disappointment when the voice cast includes Ryan Reynolds Paul Giamatti Samuel L. Jackson Maya Rudolph Richard Jenkins Ken Jeong Snoop Dogg and Luis Guzman? Its always a little tacky to answer your own question but yes. ""Turbo"" directed by David Soren is ultimately a disappointment if mildly so. Its the story of a snail named Theo (Reynolds) who prefers the nickname ""Turbo"" because hes a huge fan of car racing. He spends his nights watching tapes of the Indy 500 idolizing the nearly unbeatable Guy Gagne (Bill Hader). So theres your irony in case it was lost on you Snails are slow race cars are fast. Then again youre presumably old enough to read so this movie isnt really aimed squarely at you anyway. Turbo lives in a snail community. His overly cautious brother Chet (Giamatti) warns him constantly that he shouldnt get his hopes up about ... well anything really but especially not Turbos dream of one day racing himself. One night after a disaster that affects both him and Chet Turbo winds up at a drag race and is sucked into the engine of one of the cars. The nitrous oxide pumps into him and boom He can zip along at speeds greater than 200 mph. Chet naturally is more worried than impressed but the two brothers wind up at the business of two other brothers Angelo (Guzman) and Tito (Michael Pena) the proprietors of Dos Bros Tacos. As it happens Tito also is into racing ... snails. Small world. This introduces a cool cast of supporting characters racing snails played by Jackson Snoop Rudolph and others. To get to the Indy 500 Turbo will have to win over his new friends while Tito will have to win over the other business owners (Jenkins Jeong and Michelle Rodriguez) in the run-down Van Nuys mall where they work. But Turbo especially has to win over his dismissive brother. So our themes here are underdogs teamwork little brothers impressing older brothers. Believing in yourself more than your heroes will come into play also but like everything in ""Turbo"" this comes as no surprise. If it sounds like a slog well it is about snails albeit fast ones. But the film does have some worthy elements. One is the voice work. They arent always given the best dialogue but all the cast members make their characters distinctive; Jackson Giamatti and Pena are especially good. Its also nice to see characters of color so well-represented particularly in a movie that will make a big impression on small children. And as Gagne points out you cant go too far wrong with a story about underdogs. The animation also is top-notch. Not just tire fragments and crows in flight coming at you in 3-D. The little worlds Soren and the animators create are genuinely impressive. And the racing scenes at Indy are spectacular (though perhaps none more so than the opening scene in which the point of view swoops down from above and follows the cars up over and under). Theres certainly no harm in seeing ""Turbo."" Competent pretty funny in places awfully nice to look at that sort of thing. Theres just not a lot of excitement though.

Deflation Thats what youll feel after sitting through this DreamWorks animated feature that laps the competition in genericness. Whether youre a viewer who hasnt endured your share of decent-to-dreadful toons this summer or someone who survived Epic (for which we offer our deepest condolences) this exercise in brightly colored computer-rendered demographic pandering will inspire waves of shrugging--and beaucoup deja vu. Anthropomorphized creatures underdogs banding together follow-your-bliss platitudes toothless satirical digs (Theo works an assembly-line job at ""The Plant""--which is an actual plant. Jokes) recognizable celebrity voices and pop songs that cover the urban-to-MOR spectrum These elements form the basic DNA of 99 percent of modern animated family entertainment. But as Pixar and others have demonstrated you can use these building blocks to construct movies that have depth and that keep parents from wanting to open a vein while still being a sugar-rush conduit. All Turbo does is give Reynolds Paul Giamatti Samuel L. Jackson and Snoop Dogg the easiest paychecks theyll ever make and its corporate overlords the chance to sell a few toys. The only unique element it brings to the table is putting a Hispanic character front and center--a diversity effort diminished by the fact that hes a taco-truck driver who skirts perilously close to cringeworthy caricature. One step forward several high-speed steps back. It cant be gone fast enough.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then John Lasseter should be blushing right about now. Dreamworks Turbo about a mollusk with an inconvenient need for speed crams several of Pixars greatest hits into a shiny new shell. First theres the films microscopic milieu a backyard kingdom not unlike the evergreen world of A Bugs Life. Here while the rest of his species harvests tomatoes at the ""plant"" and avoids the deadly tricycle of an enfant terrible--essentially a younger variation on Toy Storys Sid--plucky garden snail Theo (Ryan Reynolds) yearns for life in the fast lane. His impossible dream comes true when hes submerged in a tank of nitrous oxide which for some reason grants him Flash-like swiftness. Soon hes hobnobbing with a motley crew of racing escargot (think the fish-tank misfits of Finding Nemo) and--in the movies biggest narrative debt owed to Ratatouille--helping out a down-on-his-luck taco salesman (Michael Pena) who calls him ""Little Amigo."" Their destination is the Indy 500 where Theo (now rechristened Turbo) can win the patronage of Cars fans. Also Dash in The Incredibles was fast. In almost every sense Turbo feels recycled. Even when not pillaging the Pixar canon the films screenwriters are leaning on shopworn morals follow dreams fight fears believe in little guys and stand by family. (The plot interweaves two tales of brotherly conflict running Turbos tumultuous relationship with stick-in-the-mud sibling Paul Giamatti in parallel to Penas battles with older bro Luis Guzman.) Yet for all its chronic familiarity the movie has its minor pleasures many of them visual. Though at this point its basically a given that a new studio-animated movie will look good Turbo often looks downright exceptional. Christopher Nolans regular cinematographer the great Wally Pfister served as artistic consultant; his influence can be seen in the films fluid dynamic action sequences which seem governed by actual physical laws not the rubber-band reality of many cartoons. Less logical is the films world which makes about as much sense as the one in the Cars franchise. Why for example does Turbos exposure to nitro also give him headlights for eyes a car alarm and an internal radio? Where on planet Earth is snail-racing a common pastime? Is there really ""nothing in the rules that says a snail cant race"" in the Indy 500? Is Ken Jeong now contractually obligated to play every stereotypical Asian character in Hollywood cinema even the women?

TWITTER In delivering a film about a garden snail that dreams of winning the Indy 500 its as if the makers of Turbo had been pressed to come up with the most extreme underdog tale they could think of. Or else animators really are running out of ideas for original new characters. An attractively designed but narratively challenged one-note film that skews younger than the norm for big animated features these days and has limited appeal for little girls this second Fox release (after The Croods) from DreamWorks Animation since the latter left Paramount looks to do mid-range business with family audiences. PHOTOS 26 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Man of Steel Wolverine The Lone Ranger ""The sooner you accept the dull miserable nature of your existence the happier youll be"" worldly-wise snail Chet (Paul Giamatti) advises his younger brother Turbo (Ryan Reynolds) after yet another day scouring a garden tomato patch. Turbo spends all his downtime watching VHS tapes of professional car races especially the many won by his hero Guy Gagne (Bill Hader amusingly assuming a French-Canadian accent). STORY E3 Snoop Dogg Gives Surprise Performance at Turbo Party Of course the message of the film as with so many other kid-inspirational cartoons and other fantasies is that no dream is too big you can do anything if you set your mind to it etc. etc. Unfortunately the real embedded lesson of Turbo is that if youre too small or weak or otherwise incapable of greatness you have a shot to win if youre juiced. Which is what happens late one night when Turbo coming upon a Fast amp; Furious-style drag race in the dry L.A. River bed gets sucked into an engine. Instead of being toasted however the little guy becomes infused with nitrous oxide enabling him to zoom along the ground seemingly as fast as Superman shoots through the skies. Ahhh the wonders of chemicals and strength enhancers. Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire would approve. Of course Turbo needs a sponsor which it finds in the form of Van Nuys taco truck driver Tito (Michael Pena) a wild dreamer himself who argues endlessly with his more practical brother Angelo (Luis Guzman) about the merits of promoting their forlorn business--Dos Bros Tacos--with a snail. Joining in is a rainbow coalition of smart-mouthed supporting snails and neighboring business owners voiced by the eminent likes of Samuel L. Jackson Michelle Rodriguez Snoop Dogg Maya Rudolph Ben Schwartz Richard Jenkins and Ken Jeong. STORY Monsters Despicable Me 2 Turbo Summers Brutal Animation War The ultimate destination--Indianapolis--is inevitable but it takes a long time to get there given a script by director David Soren (a dialogue writer on Shark Tale) Darren Lemke (Shrek Forever After Jack the Giant Slayer) and Robert Siegel (The Wrestler Big Fan) that is short on invention and long on largely unfunny yacking. Once the gang arrives and begins overcoming the obstacles that might prevent a snail from entering a car race (conveniently unmentioned is the most obvious one that Turbo lacks four wheels and an engine) the hitherto genial Guy Gagne suddenly becomes a villain feeling so threatened by the now-mighty mollusk that he goes to all lengths to prevent an eternally humiliating defeat. In the run-up to the race and then during it you mostly wonder about how a critter so small it cant be seen on the track (although its blue/white-hot streak can be) will avoid being crunched by the giant tires of the humans racing machines; indeed the films most irreverent merit is that it is periodically honest about the fate of snails by casually showing them getting squashed by humans or gobbled up by animals especially crows. In the event Turbo just zips through traffic as if in an obstacle course the obvious longshot pipsqueak favorite in a field of giants. Although the dialogue becomes repetitive the voice performances are all solid and distinctive. But better than that are some of the visuals particularly in nocturnal scenes around the taco stand which create both a heightened realistic evocation of shabby San Fernando Valley environs and an echo of classic noir visions of semi-desperate L.A. characters deciding to put all their chips on one roll of the dice. Kudos to the director and the animators on this score but it should be noted that just as Roger Deakins was engaged to advise on Rango ace cinematographer Wally Pfister worked as visual consultant here. Henry Jackmans score is nothing if not propulsive.

Voiced with a peppy blandness by Ryan Reynolds Turbo is an oozy slow-poke garden snail with sleepy hooded eyes who dreams of being a speed demon. He spends his days noshing on backyard tomatoes and his nights watching NASCAR on TV. The ironically-named Turbo fantasizes about becoming a racing legend like his human hero Guy Gagne (Bill Hader) who through a Bouillabaisse-thick French accent tells his fans ""No dream is big and no dreamer too small."" Against the dream-dashing advice of his jowly snail brother (Paul Giamatti) Turbo takes Gagnes words to heart?especially after a freak accident transforms him into a fuel-injected mollusk with blazing speed. Turbo no longer slithers along at a millimeter-a-minute clip he burns rubber leaving a vapor trail of whizzing neon light in his wake. Soon a chubby taco-truck driver named Tito (Michael Pena) discovers Turbos supernatural gift and adds him to his freak-show menagerie of delusional gung-ho snails (a barking Samuel L. Jackson a laid-back Snoop Dogg and a sassy Maya Rudolph). He then enters Turbo into the Indy 500 where the wonder slug faces steep odds and squares off with Gagne. The climactic race scenes have a zippy whiplash velocity thanks to the films vertiginous 3-D. And while theres no denying that the film is a harmless wholesome and heart-warming ride crafted with polish and skill its also so predictable that youll see every twist in the story driving down Fifth Avenue.

Theres just one small problem Hes a snail. Closer in spirit to Pixars ""Ratatouille"" than anything the folks at DWA have yet made this endearing underdog story finds the publicly traded computer-animation studio taking a welcome risk and betting on a farfetched story idea rather than a clearly spinoff-ready property (that said Netflix has already booked the ""Turbo F.A.S.T."" series for December). The result is plenty appealing especially for younger auds though it will be a stretch for this snail tale to snare the crowd it needs to recoup its nine-figure budget.This story first appeared in the July 16 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Sheer expense aside ""Turbo"" adheres to an otherwise safe formula combining cute cartoon characters with the standard all-American ""dream big"" message If a rat can thrive in a French restaurant then why cant a snail become an Indy speedster? DWA tops it off with a roster of big-name voice talent all the better for talkshow and publicity appearances. While theres nothing wrong with casting Ryan Reynolds as Turbo per se the actor makes an odd choice since good looks are so much a part of his appeal. The voices are the souls of these characters who -- for obvious reasons including their lack of limbs -- are unusually difficult for animators to anthropomorphize. Working in Turbos favor is the fact that he and the five Racing Snails he enlists along the way fancy themselves as tiny little cars not people. Their individual personalities are ultimately defined by the way their mouths move the voice actors and the distinctive behavior of their two googly eyestalks. When we meet Turbo hes just your average brown-and-orange garden snail named Theo toiling away at the tomato ""plant"" by day and spending his off hours glued to the TV set re-living the highlights of his idol French racing champ Guy Gagne (whose name literally means ""to win""). Hilariously voiced by Bill Hader Gagne looks like Vincent Cassel and sounds a lot like the effete French snob Sacha Baron Cohen played in ""Talladega Nights"" -- an amusing yet strange rival considering only one French driver has won the Indy 500 since 1920. However ambitious his dreams Turbo is downright sluggish in real life -- until a freak accident in which he gets sucked into a street racers engine and flooded with nitrous oxide conveniently rewriting his genetic code to deliver the speed hes always craved. Though Turbos fellow mollusks have long indulged his racing delusions responsible older brother Chet (Paul Giamatti the best casting decision of the lot) wishes the kid would just snap out of it and focus on the drudgery of their factory-work existence. But Turbo dreams of the big time and though his talents arent earned (concerned parents wouldnt be wrong to interpret the film as unintentionally condoning steroid use in sports) his determination seems more important than the implications of the radioactive-blue slime streak he leaves in his wake. Meanwhile the movie makes it clear the rest of these snails dont have much to live for as hungry crows swoop down and scoop up one of their number at regular intervals -- a startling interruption thats always good for a laugh. For Turbo and his fragile-shelled ilk nearly everythings a threat and the simplistic plot provides various dangers along the way including a sadistic bug-crushing kid clearly modeled after ""Toy Storys"" next-door terror Sid. Co-writer/director David Sorens story offers little that even the average 6-year-old couldnt imagine though the films considerable charm comes through via its characters and sense of humor. (As it happens DreamWorks most amusing characters to date have been the singing slugs from ""Flushed Away."" According to insiders Jeffrey Katzenberg recognized their appeal and insisted the animators cram as many of the buggers into that toon as possible.) Here the laughs come not from the silly voices but a blend of snappy editing and clever character bits including a recurring joke about an inappropriately named sidekick who calls himself White Shadow (Michael Patrick Bell). Given the snails inherent speed challenges ""Turbo"" has fun jump-cutting from earnest closeups to dispiriting wide shots that reveal just how little they have actually moved. In Turbos case his radical transformation rivals most superheroes The pokey fella goes from a 17-minute yard to clocking more than 200 miles per hour on the Indy speedway -- though wet-blanket Chet cautions that the effects of the nitrous oxide are sure to wear off sometime. Making playful use of 3D along the way the CG toon zips past the obstacle of convincing the organizers to allow a snail to compete in the Indy 500 nimbly juggling the mismatched racers differences in scale on the track itself. While the obvious takeaway for kids is the stock no-goal-too-impossible malarkey the film also raises the more practical lesson that one cant achieve success alone fleshing out the pics second act with characters Turbo needs to succeed (including fellow snails voiced by Samuel L. Jackson Maya Rudolph and Snoop Dogg). Among the handful of humans the script introduces to mirror the conflict between Turbo and Chet are Dos Bros Tacos proprietor and unlikely team captain Tito (Michael Pena) who struggles to convince his brother (Luis Guzman) and the other local business owners (Michelle Rodriguez Richard Jenkins and Ken Jeong the latter given ample latitude to steal scenes as a feisty old Chinese lady) to back his longshot scheme. It doesnt take a genius to recognize the transparent grab for urban and Latino audiences here -- especially in light of ""Fast amp; Furious 6s"" nearly 700 million worldwide haul -- reflected in everything from the supporting cast to Henry Jackmans hip-hop-themed score. At this budget the studio will need everybody it can get to make this escargot go. Film Review TurboReviewed at Fox Studios Los Angeles July 2 2013. MPAA Rating PG. Running time 96 MIN.
