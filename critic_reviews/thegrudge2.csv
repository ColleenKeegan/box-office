The Grudge 2 is just that an English-language rehash of J-Horror quickie Ju-on The Grudge 2 which itself borrows liberally from Hideo Nakatas Ring and Dark Water. Theres a staggering lack of logic here even for a film about an elderly exorcist who disposes of evil spirits by feeding them to her young daughter who then skulks about dressed in white robes and scares people until they turn aquamarine. Basic horror conventions are bungled by the bleating shards of white noise which seem to emerge whenever a character walks down a hall sees a door sees a window sees another character or is alone in a room. The film almost seems to revel in its remake status as the dialogue feels stilted; its as if some of the American actors have had their voices dubbed on afterwards. Vapid silly and about as scary as well an Adam Sandler film.

"Grudge 2 is hardly a scream - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Grudge 2 is hardly a scream By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 14 2006 The most popular facial expression for victims in ``The Grudge 2"" is something Id like to call ``deep befuddlement."" Brow furrowed mouth slightly stupidly agape as the hairy dead mother and her clammy son pop up again in the darnedest places haunting whoever has entered the house they were murdered in. This time ``deep befuddlement"" goes double for paying customers. (Dude how is she climbing out of that pan of film developing solution?) But logic in Takashi Shimizus sequel to the Hollywood remake of his own cult classic ``Ju-On"" is beside the point. Well not entirely. The first remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar as a nurse with a curse made a pile of money in 2004. Why shouldnt this one? But Lord this is a sorry excuse for a payday.Among the check cashers is Amber Tamblyn late of TVs ``Joan of Arcadia."" She plays Gellars estranged spineless sister Aubrey whose melodramatically bed ridden mother (Joanna Cassidy) sends the meek daughter to Tokyo to find the cursed one and bring her home. Well she finds her at least in the hospital; bringing her home is another story.She also finds a handsome journalist named Eason (Edison Chen). These two walk very slowly into the first movies haunted house looking for clues to explain Aubreys sisters condition even though the police tape wrapped around the entrance says ``Keep Out."" Exposure to the house which Gellars character torched at the end of the first picture leaves them catatonic and paranoid like theyre off drugs and on them at the same time.To keep us in deeper befuddlement the story often shifts to Chicago where Jennifer Beals has just moved in with her boyfriend his cheerleader daughter and his half-pint son. Obviously they see dead people too. In both cities the thrills are cheap. Japanese horror has never been a narrative enterprise. But in America Shimizus talent for metaphysical surprise turns into desperate gotcha moments and dubious dialogue.Shimizu appears to have left his cast members to their own devices and they need upgrades -- although Takako Fuji and Ohga Tanaka as the ghosts do MTV Movie Award-caliber work by just crouching in a phone booth. Still the sight of victims standing by and casually watching as nonsense stares them in the face is simply not the stuff of horror. It is pretty funny though when that cheerleader casually takes a cellphone call while her zombified best friend pukes milk back into the container. Indeed one mans ``Grudge 2"" is anothers ``Scary Movie 9."" (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Grudge 2 Doubly Baffling washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Grudge 2 Doubly Baffling ""Grudge"" rematch Amber Tamblyn above faces the curse that afflicted her sister (Sarah Michelle Gellar who reprises her role from the first film). (By David Appleby -- Sony Pictures Classics Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Saturday October 14 2006 Even my pathological love of Japan and its beauties glories and eccentricities is sorely tested by ""The Grudge 2"" from Takashi Shimizu a movie so bewildering and impenetrable that I believe it siphoned off a good 40 IQ points. Shimizu obviously reiterates the central mechanism of the ultra-spooky ""The Grudge."" It follows from a folk superstition that anyone who dies in a fit of rage leaves a curse in the location of his or her death and that curse contaminates and ultimately destroys all who come into contact with it. The meaning of the curse is resonant which perhaps explains the global impact of the series (this is the second American version after four Japanese variants; a fifth Japanese film is on drawing boards). It suggests the lingering effects of domestic violence and the process by which a murderous episode sends ripples across time and space affecting everybody in range. The first two Japanese films were videos as the straight-to-vid production is more highly thought of in Tokyo than here; so Shimizu was working on a low budget and his genius lay in coaxing some really frightening imagery out of some extremely low-tech effects. Now ""The Grudge"" has gone international and is fronted by a big American company. But Shimizu has shrewdly stayed low-tech. He knows that whats scary isnt a giant monster or skeletons in flames or the Golden Gate bending into a pretzel but small seedy images of white ghosts emerging into blurry view in a dark corner accompanied by a soundtrack that seems like the banshees of Hell playing Charlie Danielss ""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" backward and really really loud. The noise itself made me confess to crimes only a much more interesting person could have committed. Theres also -- hmm how to say this delicately and keep the job? -- a certain fetish element involved. Eros never confronted directly is everywhere in the film which traffics primarily in images that are both horrible and beautiful at once that repel as they attract. Shimizu is fascinated by hair and the kohl-ringed eyes of his ghosts are always framed in licks of raven protein descending in a combination of erotic allure and tendrilly distress. At a certain point a beautiful blond American teenager is lethally consumed in black tresses from above. Then there are greedy grasping ghost-white hands that pop from nowhere and pull the unwary into darkness where our imaginations boggle at what we believe is going on. (This might also be read as a metaphor for the ""Asianization"" of horror as a genre The black tresses are clearly meant to suggest long Japanese hair and theyre deployed against the iconic symbol of American horror victimhood the dim mean blond high-schooler.) Too bad the film makes no sense at all. Maybe its not supposed to make sense. On the other hand one of the failed initiatives of this movie is to advance a certain explanation that holds the conceit together while rationalizing its spread to another continent. I think. Or I guess. Anyhow the movie tracks between two parallel stories one still in Tokyo and the other in Chicago. And just to make it all the more difficult to comprehend Shimizu casts two actresses who look amazingly alike in two different roles so youre always baffled. Again he may be tweaking Americans who famously cant read Asian faces; hes making it impossible to read American faces The story that remains in Tokyo follows the arrival of Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to visit her sister in the hospital. Her sister Karen of course is Sarah Michelle Gellar the star of the first American ""Grudge"" who was last seen burning down the house that was the source of the evil that haunted that movie. Alas poor Karen doesnt hang around for long and soon enough the Japanese portion of the movie tracks Aubreys investigation of events with the simultaneous adventures of three private-school girls also fascinated and ultimately destroyed by the house. The central girl is played by Arielle Kebbel who looks enough like Tamblyn to turn the movies coherence to shambles. Meanwhile in Chicago a happy country family moves to the city and begins to disintegrate for some reason. In fact the movie begins out of sequence with the climax of its troubles when Ma (Jennifer Beals) brains Pa with a skillet. The whole family and the family next door are ultimately destroyed over the following 96 minutes. The connection between the two events is easy to predict and lacks much in the way of dramatic force; nevertheless its the ""big secret"" toward which Shimizu drives his film. I will say that the last few minutes -- when both stories crescendo and both sets of characters tumble into some intense self-destruction -- is powerful not as a function of story but as a function of spectacle. Its creepy and Charlie Daniels backward is something no man should be made to endure. The Grudge 2 (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for psychological intensity but not much gore or sex.

Pic already marks the sixth time director Takashi Shimizu has exploited the same gimmick of a ghostly mother and child who hunt down anyone foolish enough to trespass inside their Tokyo house. The curse never dies and with ""The Grudge 2"" scaring up a solid 22 million in its opening frame expect theaters to be visited by still more nonsensical installments in this intermittently scary series. Pic already marks the sixth time director Takashi Shimizu has exploited the same gimmick of a ghostly mother and child who hunt down anyone foolish enough to trespass inside their Tokyo house. This time however Sarah Michelle Gellar (who helped drive the 2004 remake to a 39 million opening) appears just long enough to ensure she wont be back. Shimizus only major concession in repeating Japanese-language ""Ju-On The Grudge"" for U.S. auds was allowing his new leading lady to outlive her tormentors. Karen (Gellar) escaped the first pic thinking she had outwitted the creepy mother-daughter team by burning down their house. Turns out Shimizu merely stopped her story one scene short and the phantom pair is more than happy to pay an after-hours visit to the hospital where Karen is being restrained. The scream queens Drew Barrymore-style cameo ends on the hospital roof (or rather splattered on the sidewalk below) but it says something that the filmmakers cared enough about continuity to include her in the sequel. Once shes gone though auds are left with no clear character to root for -- just more victims including a fresh batch of schoolgirls determined to explore the house. Karens corpse lands at the feet of two new characters her shell-shocked sister Aubrey (Amber Tamblyn) who looks forlorn through the entire film and in-over-his-head journalist Eason (""Infernal Affairs"" Edison Chen). While these two junior detectives pry into the mystery of what killed Karen a new scenario unfolds halfway around the world. Somehow the now-contagious spirit has made its way to Chicago where it inspires evil deeds in an unrelated family. Cooking bacon in the kitchen Trish (Jennifer Beals) pours hot grease on her husbands head (Christopher Cousins) then hits him with the frying pan. The scene makes no sense but then the rules that govern the grudge were never clear in the original either. In the original entering the house was all it took to inspire death-by-sound-effects; this time anything goes. Shimizus favorite visual trick remains honing the camera in close on a character then drifting around to reveal an unwelcome visitor reflected in a window or lurking in the corner of the frame -- either raccoon-eyed Toshio (Oga Tanaka) pale hands clutching his bone-white knees to his chest or raspy Kayako (Takako Fuji whos played the mother since the very first installment) ankle broken neck snapped vengeful eye glaring through wiry black hair. As unimaginative as it may seem (and predictable as these appearances now are) the device works every time. Story is incidental as auds merely anticipate the scares. Shimizu and screenwriter Stephen Susco interrupt the frights with ponderous scenes between characters whose expiration dates are due sooner than the milk one unfortunate young lady regurgitates back into its carton -- yet another example of an image every bit as unsettling as it is inexplicable. All this unnecessary plotting exists simply to provide backstory for the undead duo. Aubrey eventually tracks down the dead girls mother (Kim Miyori) who warns ""There can be no end to what has started"" which means of course that the next ghastly mother and child reunion is only a heartbeat away. Lensing is gray and nondescript by design enhancing the stark contrast of the bone-white/jet-black ghouls. Scary sound effects including the guttural throat rattle spoofed in ""Scary Movie 4"" have lost some of their efficacy since the last installment.

Directed by Takashi Shimizu. (PG-13. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Grudge 2"" begins with Jennifer Beals dumping sizzling bacon grease on some dudes head before smashing him with a frying pan - and you immediately know its not going to be too bad of a movie. Takashi Shimizu may have already directed and at least co-written six ""Grudge"" films this century in Japan and the United States -- with one more scheduled for next year -- but he keeps delivering memorable little flourishes. Like that Jungle Cruise guide at Disneyland who can say the same thing 50 times per day and still sound excited about it Shimizu doesnt appear to be getting tired of mindless repetition. The same cant be said for audiences who have endured maybe two too many ""Grudge"" and ""Ring"" and ""Pulse"" movies and sequels. The films have lots of style but no logic which stands out more with each release. As a genre these American remakes of Japanese ghost-in-the-machine horror cinema are quickly getting old. Shimizu brings back all the old bad guys from ""The Grudge"" (the skinny blue girl the little boy who meows like a cat the homicidal strands of black hair ...) but he shakes up the plot quite a bit. Sarah Michelle Gellar returns as Karen Davis for about 25 seconds but this time the director opts for ensemble horror -- a Robert Altman ""Short Cuts""-style approach that has Davis sister (Amber Tamblyn from ""Joan of Arcadia"") a picked-on high schooler (Arielle Kebbel) and a woman settling down with a new family (Beals still looking delicious in her mid-40s) each dealing with the curse in different places. The acting is solid and tension is never a problem in Shimizus films. Anyone whos seen ""The Ring"" or ""The Grudge"" knows that the bad guys can pop out of just about anywhere. (I havent seen the script for ""The Grudge 3"" but Ill bet the first person who e-mails me 20 that at least one of the ghosts jumps out of a toaster like a Pop-Tart.) Unfortunately weve hit the point of diminishing returns with all this weirdness. The more ""Grudge"" films you see the more the rules in this universe are unveiled as totally random -- to the point where you stop caring. Unlike a good slasher film where you know at least in theory that the good guys might turn the tables its a foregone conclusion that everyone who gets cursed in these movies will eventually die. What makes ""The Grudge 2"" watchable is the gleefully unpredictable things that happen before that time comes. When the Beals characters stepdaughter comes across a cursed friend she doesnt just stand still while looking like a zombie. She chugs a half gallon of milk and then purges most of it back into the carton -- while still looking like a zombie. But the fun distractions take up only so much screen time and as ""The Grudge 2"" heads into its second hour its easy to focus on the flaws. The blue girl and cat boy get especially old almost to the point of campiness. While everyone cheered Beals breakfast smackdown this time people were mostly just laughing at the spooky ghost kids. -- Advisory Since the creepy little boy in this film appears to kill people by meowing at them ""The Grudge 2"" is on the tame end of horror films in terms of gore and violence. Theres some strong language but no nudity or sex. Who has time to think about getting it on when theres a freaky-looking ghost girl crawling out of your refrigerator?
