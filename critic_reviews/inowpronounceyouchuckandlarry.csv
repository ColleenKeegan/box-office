A few songs have gone missing from ""Hairspray"" the movie musical the latest iteration of John Waterss 1988 cult favorite. But the energy -- well to paraphrase the shows climactic number ""You cant stop the energy."" ""Hairspray"" which concerns the efforts of a big-hearted 60s adolescent to integrate an ""American Bandstand""-style TV dance party is lively pretty good fun and as exhausting as a Richard Simmons exercise video. ENLARGE When director Rob Marshall brought the hit Broadway musical ""Chicago"" to the screen it became a whole other entity reconceived and rethought. Only DNA testing could have made its paternity clear. The 2005 movie version of the hit Broadway musical ""The Producers"" on the other hand had no such reimagining. It was a flat-footed -- and utterly flat -- transfer to celluloid with the stage roots showing. ""Hairspray"" falls somewhere between the two. Admittedly no new ground is broken here. Indeed with its Necco-wafer palette dance dream sequences and characters suddenly and unaccountably bursting into song the movie is a throwback to MGM musicals of the 50s. But its a giddy unselfconscious throwback. That in itself is refreshing. A triple-espresso jolt named Nikki Blonsky plays Tracy Turnblad a chubby irrepressible stump of a teenager who -- Gotta dance Gotta dance -- dreams of becoming a regular on the ""Corny Collins Show"" (read Dick Clark). Those extra pounds make Tracy a nonstarter in the eyes of WYZTs viperous station manager Velma Von Tussle (Michelle Pfeiffer wonderfully over the top) whose daughter Amber (Brittany Snow) is the shows reigning sweetheart. But when Corny sees Tracys moves at a school sock hop shes anointed and much to the rage of the Von Tussles becomes a viewer favorite. Cornys outreach is admirable and of course necessary for the plot but with all due respect to Ms. Blonsky her terpsichorean skills are nothing special. The racist Velma who gives ""Negro"" teenagers the dance floor exactly once a month is further exercised by Tracys on-air wish -- after all shes learned her snazziest footwork from black classmates -- to have every day be Negro day. The integration issue was reasonably well handled on stage; here it comes across as preachy. The subsequent civil-rights march with the curiously subdued Queen Latifah leading the charge has the unfortunate effect of stopping the movie in its tracks. One of the enduring camp conventions of ""Hairspray"" is that Tracys plus-size mother Edna is played by a man in drag. John Travoltas donning of Mrs. Turnblads housedress has received far more attention than it -- or his performance -- warrants. Except for one deftly tossed off ""Pulp Fiction"" salute the jape falls flat. Mr. Travoltas specific contributions to the role are an overlay of creepiness and an impossible-to-place accent. In the musical numbers where by rights Mr. Travolta should shine hes almost out-danced and certainly out-charmed by Ednas better half Wilbur (Christopher Walken) who is one of the movies great assets an oasis of calm amid the twisting and shouting. Sunshine Those who share Al Gores concerns about global warming point to the shrinking polar ice cap; they talk about the dangers of rising sea levels the likelihood of severe droughts of more frequent and powerful hurricanes. But so far there hasnt been a single word about the collateral damage of global warming movies like Danny Boyles ""Sunshine"" a warmed-over stew of sci-fi and gothic horror with bits of ""Alien"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""Ten Little Indians"" thrown in. Its the mid-21st century and for reasons not made clear in Alex Garlands incoherent script the sun is dying. Unless something is done -- and fast -- mankind is doomed. Seven years earlier a manned spacecraft was launched armed with a bomb (apparently the nuclear version of defibrillator paddles) to boost the wattage of the star at the center of the solar system. Things went awry; the spaceship was apparently lost in the cosmos. Now aboard Icarus II -- unfaltering recall of Greek mythology is not advantageous here -- a crew of eight is trying again. In fact ""Sunshine"" has a promising takeoff; the exposition is crisp and imaginatively executed the visual effects stunning. But when the astronauts hear a recognizable radio signal they decide to veer off course and investigate. Soon after the movie careens off course as well. Instead of going where no man has gone before ""Sunshine"" inhabits familiar territory There are the predictable malfunctions that compromise the space craft the banal speechifying about the fate of mankind the issue of who will live and who will die. Who cares? The characters are so sketchily drawn that its hard to keep them straight let alone get worked up about their survival. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry Its not much of an achievement these days for a movie to disparage one or another ethnic group race religion political party or sexual orientation. Some like ""Borat"" managed to offend several. In under two hours the synthetic insufferable ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" manages to insult gays straights men women children African-Americans Asians pastors mailmen insurance adjusters firemen doctors -- and fans of show music. Thats championship stuff. Larry Valentine (Kevin James) and Chuck Levine (Adam Sandler) are best friends and fellow firemen and as the filmmakers are at pains to make clear heterosexuals. Larrys a widower and still mourning his wife so thats why he isnt getting anything like the action of ladies man Chuck an unreconstructed mattress-tester if ever there was one. When Larry saves his buddys life on the job a grateful Chuck wants to return the favor and Larry has quite the favor in mind. A thicket of red tape is preventing him from naming his two children as pension and life-insurance beneficiaries. To protect the kids interests Uncle Chuck need simply declare himself Larrys domestic partner. All on the QT of course. When a prissy bureaucrat begins checking on the legitimacy of the arrangement with Javert-like fervor the two men hire a lawyer (Jessica Biel) with whom Chuck is immediately smitten. Get married she urges her new clients. The inevitable complications make Chuck and Larrys relationship front-page news and a cause celebre. In the guise of lampooning gay stereotypes ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" simply reinforces them. There are witless attempts to wring humor from the nudge-nudge wink-wink fondness of Larrys young son for tap-dancing and belting out show tunes. This is a movie determined to have it both ways -- blending empty piety (why cant we all just accept one another) with prurience. In one cringe-inducing scene Ms. Biel clad only in bra and panties bemoans the fact that everyone believes her breasts are silicone and invites Chuck to conduct a personal inspection. His carefully considered opinion Theyre real. If so theyre the only things in the movie that are.    DVD TIP Kevin Klines wedding to fellow teacher Joan Cusack is just days off when hes made to realize hes gay in the sharp hilarious ""In amp; Out"" (1998). Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

"Chuck amp; Larry Crude but caring | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesChuck amp; Larry Crude but caringBy way of making the most socially progressive movie hes ever produced the lately nice-making Adam Sandler has reverted to his most regressive form of funny. As the party-hearty horndog Brooklyn fireman Chuck Levine in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry  Sandler plays a character who will delight everyone nostalgic for the days of Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison  a vulgarian child-man of simple passions and simpler mind a guy who is to booty what junebugs are to headlights.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. July 20 2007 Starring Adam Sandler Kevin James Jessica Biel. Written by Barry Fanaro Alexander Payne Jim Taylor. Directed by Dennis Dugan. At major theatres. 110 minutes. 14A Article Continued Below By way of making the most socially progressive movie hes ever produced the lately nice-making Adam Sandler has reverted to his most regressive form of funny. As the party-hearty horndog Brooklyn fireman Chuck Levine in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry Sandler plays a character who will delight everyone nostalgic for the days of Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison a vulgarian child-man of simple passions and simpler mind a guy who is to booty what junebugs are to headlights.So what will the die-hards make of the fact Chuck also happens to be married to another guy the almost equally simple and slovenly - but considerably sweeter - firefighter Larry Valentine (Kevin James)? True theirs is a marriage of sitcom convenience determined less by passionate inclination than the fact the still-grieving widower Larry needs to marry someone in order to bypass bureaucratic hell and collect the pension due his two kids. But the fact remains Chuck and Larry is a comedy with an agenda and its an agenda that might only play to the hardcore Sandler constituency if its done up in drag. Which is to say if you want to go all gay-positive on the straight yahoo crowd keep the brow low and the tone light. Dont go brokin no backs.Scripted by the Sideways team of Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor with assistance by former Golden Girls writer Barry Fanaro Chuck and Larry focuses on the guys emerging sense of enlightenment as their marriage is rudely outed and they become both objects of fundamentalist gay-bashers and heroes of the gay community the faux-gay guys begin to learn just how much ignorance and stupidity is required to nurture a full-blown case of homophobia.They learn - great leapin lizards - that yes dude gays are people too. While much of the comedy is rooted in the sheer effort Chuck and Larry have to put in simply to pass convincingly for queers - ""I used to wrestle a lot in high school"" says Chuck to the lawyer (Jessica Biel) hes lamely trying to convince he really gay ""and I liked it"" - the movies ultimate object of ridicule is dumb-ass ignorance itself. Although it adheres to the current movie comedy conventions dictating bland filmmaking style lumpy narrative trajectory and about 15 minutes of trimmable flab Chuck and Larry remains something close to remarkable an Adam Sandler movie that manages to be crude and caring in equal measure.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" with Adam Sandler Kevin James Jessica Biel Ving Rhames Nick Swardson Steve Buscemi Dan Aykroyd. Directed by Dennis Dugan from a screenplay by Barry Fanaro Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor.115 minutes. Rated PG-13 for crude sexual content throughout nudity language and drug references. In its clunky way ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" is mildly subversive -- for a Hollywood comedy starring Adam Sandler that is. The story of a pair of heterosexual New York firefighters who pose as gay domestic partners its ultimately about acceptance and tolerance. Early on Sandlers character is a homophobe who easily uses the F-slur; by movies end hes furiously correcting those who use the word and proudly proclaiming his love for his best friend. These are valuable (and still rare on the big screen) lessons; too bad they couldnt have been employed in a funnier movie. You may watch ""Chuck amp; Larry"" thinking fondly of ""In amp; Out"" the 1997 comedy in which a small-town teacher (Kevin Kline) is accidentally outed by a former student. Scripted by Paul Rudnick the movie giddily conveyed its messages of acceptance through funny one-liners goofball character work (Joan Cusacks performance is a classic) and a playful approach to stereotypes. Though ""Chuck amp; Larry"" borrows a message an ampersand and its ending from ""In amp; Out"" the similarities end there. The screenplay written by Barry Fanaro and rewritten by the ""Sideways"" team of Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor is heavy-handed in its comedy. Theres an interminable shower scene at the fire station and way too much screen time devoted to the supposedly hilarious prospect of two straight men kissing. Though Sandler gives his usual nonperformance (you hear a lot of criticism about actresses rendered nonexpressive by Botox but its Sandler whose face never moves above the nose) the wisenheimer friendship between his Chuck and Kevin James Larry is believable. Theyre regular guys whose work has required them to watch out for each other and when widower Larry learns of a pension glitch that denies life insurance benefits to his two kids womanizing Chuck more-or-less willingly steps up as his domestic partner -- a matter which he thinks will only involve a signature on a few city forms. (As presented in the movie this doesnt make much sense; clearly were not supposed to dwell on it.) When the pension administrators smell a rat an investigator (Steve Buscemi) is dispatched and Chuck and Larry find themselves cohabitating shopping for ""gay stuff"" (in a funny scene they rush through a drugstore wondering if say Band-Aids are too straight) and trying to maintain a fiction that -- at first -- nobody believes. And a pretty lawyer (Jessica Biel) hired to assist them catches Chucks wandering eye complicating matters. A few funny bits register along the way as well as a couple of surprises For example who knew that Sandler when costumed in a Dracula wig (for a gay costume ball) looks uncannily like the ""Happy Days"" era Henry Winkler? But for the most part ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" plods along predictably well-intentioned but only sporadically entertaining.

Comedy about two straight firefighters who get married in order to claim domestic partner benefits. With Adam Sandler Kevin James Jessica Biel. Director Dennis Dugan (155). PG-13 Crass humor. At area theaters. The new Adam Sandler comedy ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is the movie equivalent of a double-jointed contortionist who can walk forward with his head turned backward. It is an hour and a half of cliched gay jokes and 25 minutes of pro-gay apologies. With a script partially credited to the team behind the Pinot Noir comedy hit ""Sideways"" ""Chuck and Larry"" is a lazy sitcom about two straight firefighting buddies who pretend to be a gay couple in order to get domestic partner benefits. Seems that the chubby recently widowed Larry (Kevin James) cannot provide for his two kids in the event of his death unless hes married to a woman or officially partnered with a man. Since hes too in love with his late wife to consider a second romance he turns to the friend whose life he has just saved and requests the favor of a mock marriage. The friend is Chuck (Sandler) the incorrigible skirt-chasing Mr. February in their Brooklyn firehouses annual beefcake calendar. Larry is just sensitive enough to pass for gay but Chuck no way; there are five women in his bed at any time. Thats the setup for the anecdotal sketches that are strung together in lieu of a plot. Just imagine the panic in the firehouse shower when Chuck and Larry show up and somebody drops a bar of soap. Or imagine Chucks suppressed delight when his bodacious legal advocate (Jessica Biel) asks him to fondle her breasts by way of confirming their naturalness. Then there is the announcement by the meanest and most fearsome looking member of the department (Ving Rhames) that he too is gay. The shower scene goes on way too long the breast fondling scene is downright creepy and rather than playing a he-man with a secret Rhames performance turns into an impersonation of a teenage girl. Worse Sandlers untalented buddy Rob Schneider appears in two racist scenes where he plays the bucktoothed nearsighted Asian-Canadian pastor who marries Chuck and Larry. Directed with his usual flair for the obvious by Dennis Dugan (""The Benchwarmers) ""Chuck and Larry"" has the nowness factor of a Polish joke. Does anybody laugh at this stuff anymore?

Photo Universal I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Smug self-awareness a toxic substance anywhere is fatal to comedies. But there it is maybe 40 minutes into I Now Pronounce You Chuckand Larry. The noxious moment that says it all. The hypocritical line that announces a pro-gay stance in a movie thats pockmarked with antediluvian cliches. A lawyer says it -- Jessica Biel but a lawyer nonetheless -- to a pair of straight Brooklyn firefighters who are faking gayness to get domestic-partner benefits from the city of New York. ""Gays and lesbians have not been fighting for these rights for 40 years to be made a mockery of"" she says not yet comprehending that smack before her sit two major makers of mockery. The first a nice-enough widower named Larry (Kevin James) has talked the second a total scuzz named Chuck (Adam Sandler) into their reverse-Birdcage scenario so that Larrys kids will be covered by Chucks benefits. This seems like a smart idea or not until Nosy Parkers from the city arrive to investigate their homosexual authenticity or not and the pair cement their counterfeit partnership at an all-night chapel in Ontario. In the thundering proximity of Niagara Falls they stand Chuck in white Larry in black as Rob Schneider (playing an unconscionably stereotyped Chinese minister or maybe The Incredibles Edna Mode) declares ""I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may kiss the husband."" They dont which strikes me as shortsighted Wouldnt a picture of the two guys lip-locked go a long way toward silencing the skeptics? But I Now Pronounce You coyly sidesteps that territory or any other territory not already trampled to dust by thundering herds of anally fixated screenwriters. If you follow the movies logic men are gay if they dress up as the Village People or make back-door puns while delivering for the Postal Service. Director Dennis Dugan gave us 2006s heinously unfunny The Benchwarmers and 1999s Big Daddy in which Sandlers character aped fatherhood. Thanks mainly to James apoplectic delivery and puppyish charm I Now Pronounce You Chuckand Larry isnt a total wash; and speaking of ablutions Ving Rhames sings Chaka Khan in the shower. But unless youre a fan of breast jokes morbid-obesity humor oversexed-Russian-housekeeper gags and unconscionable bucktoothed Asian stereotypes then sorry youre out of luck. The films multiple scribes include Sideways Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. No credit is given (as far as I can see) to the Australian film Strange Bedfellows or the French comedy The Closet but Im wondering if this recent spate of straights-in-the-land-of-gays movies signals some kind of cultural reckoning with the gay-rights movement. Just as Mississippi Burning told black history from a white POV maybe I Now Pronounce You Chuckand Larry validates the gay experience by foisting it on a couple of hetero lunks. In the credits the filmmakers acknowledge Brooklyn firefighters who died on 9/11. Its an honorable gesture but what of the previous two hours? What of the scenes portraying firemen as cigar-chomping homophobic misogynistic chumps? After all they havent been fighting fires all these years to be made a mockery of.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED July 18 2007 at 200 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 828 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive linemen can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Every time the ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" trailer gave me a sinking feeling Id grab the production notes. Surely this comedy starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James as New York firefighters and best friends who pretend to be a gay couple couldnt be as lame as its preview promised. Little comfort came in learning Dennis Dugan was director. His notable credits (""Big Daddy"" ""Happy Gilmore"") make him too beholden to Sandler. But wouldnt writers Barry Fanaro (TVs ""Golden Girls"") and the tag team of Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (""Sideways"") have the skills to pull off a decent comedy teasing straight-guy anxieties about gay male sexuality intimacy and yes women? What began as a search for solace now provides the names of those to blame for a movie that blows every opportunity to be smart funny timely. Lazier comedies can be found. But not this summer. Those as unfunny - just like ""License to Wed"" which no longer seems too bad - dont squander the likes of Ving Rhames Steve Buscemi and Dan Aykroyd. As Chuck and Larrys stationhouse captain Aykroyd displays the movies best comedic timing. Rhames has predictable yet vivid moments as a manlier-than-Samson colleague. When bureaucratic inflexibility meets emotional stasis widower Larry (James) learns he cant name his children beneficiaries to his pension. A bolt of inspiration comes by way of a newspaper headline about New York City upholding the right of gay couples to domestic partnership benefits. Chuck (Sandler) owes Larry a favor. Larry saved his buddys life. So let it be really huge. Larry tells Chuck his plan. And his hyper-masculine pal uses an all-too commom slur. Just in case you didnt hear him he repeats it. So will others. Since this comedy isnt likely to come down on the side of bigotry Larry and especially Chuck will learn how the other gays live when they are ostracized by their colleagues harassed by fanatics and generally misunderstood and mistrusted. ""Were good for the Boy Scout sleepover"" a fellow dad at the elementary school Chucks son attends tells Chuck who planned to chaperone. Great Chuck says. No were good the man says making his meaning clear. So goes Chuck and Larrys journey toward tolerance acceptance and self-acceptance. Because as weak as it is ""Chuck amp; Larry"" is a morality tale about how straight male friendship can coexist - even deepen - in a world in which gay men are out and proud. One can only imagine the creative conflicts that took a potentially interesting idea to boneheaded fruition. Tired gags that you can expect cover girl-on-girl action and morbid obesity. Running jokes that lag include one about a Japanese man (Rob Schneider) who performs marriage ceremonies in Canada and another about Chucks musical-loving young son. (ABCs ""Ugly Betty"" handles kid gender issues better.) Then theres the films insistence that Chuck a.k.a. Mr. February on a calendar of NYC firemen is a chick magnet. Uh-huh. Jessica Biel plays Alex the lawyer the guys hire when it becomes clear that not everyone believes their relationship is on the up and up. Buscemi looking like a bedraggled John Waters has the unpleasant task of playing an officious investigator set on outing the fellas as frauds. If Im spoiling something for you here good. Youll thank me. And your 13-year-old son wont care. Floating in the muck of ""Chuck amp; Larry"" one can almost discern some Golden Era gestures. Theres a classic American comedy about mistaken identities and humanism buried deep within. But it would take Billy Wilder to make this off-tune mess sing. As good as Payne and Taylor have been as writers they dont come near the populist sophistication of ""Some Like It Hot."" No doubt some of this grousing will strike die-hard fans of Sandler (the only people who can legitimately be satisfied with this flick) as so much PC ranting. Theyre right if by PC they mean professionally cranky. In the spirit of uncivil unions I now denounce you ""Chuck amp; Larry.""

"A farcical (but tame) take on friends with benefits - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review A farcical (but tame) take on friends with benefits Adam Sandler (left) and Kevin James play straight firefighters who feign marriage for domestic- partner benefits in ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry."" (TRACY BENNETT/UNIVERSAL) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 20 2007 In ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry "" Adam Sandler and Kevin James play Brooklyn firemen who feign marriage to each other for the domestic-partner benefits. The city wont let James just make his two kids his beneficiaries. This sounds like the kind of American travesty Michael Moore could use for his next movie. He could even recycle an old title ""Sicko.""Broad and badly made but sporadically inspired ""Chuck and Larry"" is still an amazing improvement over ""License to Wed"" this months other wedding comedy. But the movie seems tame when it really could have subversively brought the house down.Sandlers flamboyantly straight Chuck goes to Ontario to wed and moves into Larrys house where his discomfort with the arrangement vanishes. He helps cook the meals raise the kids and shares a bed with Larry. Outside a costume ball he stands up to picketing bigots and discovers his being with Larry means hes perceived as a ""chubby chaser"" (a guy who prefers a few extra pounds in his men). He embarks on a girls day with Hollywoods favorite prop Jessica Biel (amiably playing the sexy lawyer defending Chuck and Larry against a possible fraud charge) and consoles a supermacho firefighter whos inspired by Chuck and Larrys love to out himself.Eventually the very idea of what gay means seems up for grabs -- momentarily. Only when Sandler who has never been less deranged  and James whos actually very good are domesticating does the movie seem comfortable with itself.Otherwise ""Chuck and Larry"" is torn between shouting down homophobia and asserting its own hetero urges (those generous shots of Biels rump; an entire scene of her in panties bra and heels; Sandler feeling her up at her request).Despite parts for Dan Aykroyd and Steve Buscemi the film is often too self-conscious to be truly gangbusters which is too bad since no one says anything revealing or self-reflective. This is a film in which people are content not to talk about their feelings which is odd since two-thirds of the surviving script is credited to Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor  the men who wrote ""Sideways "" ""About Schmidt "" and ""Election ."" (The other third goes to Barry Fanaro. ) Payne and Taylor are the Chuck and Larry of semi-satire and somehow the ambivalent tone of their own movies has crept past Dennis Dugans fumbling direction and into this one.The stress falls on visual gags jokes about Jamess weight and the sort of crudeness we have come to expect from a Sandler vehicle (see James pull his little girl out of the toilet). Theres a Three Stooges-load of slaps and the usual gay cliches Larrys young son (Cole Morgen ) is a flaming theater queen who seems to have fallen out of a Mel Brooks movie. So do Ving Rhames  whose inconsistent mincing is amusing and Nick Swardson  as Biels fratty-queeny brother.The rest of the movie doesnt have what it takes for Brookss kind of farce. It needs abandon. It needs a musical number. It needs the kiss from ""Y Tu Mama Tambien ."" Where is the Mel Brooks of now? The film is bridled and uncomfortable. Like so many other Hollywood movies ""Chuck and Larry"" has a limited idea of gayness even as it preaches for homosexuals. Gay is still signified and performed as opposed to lived. Liberation still means singing some divas anthem (here its Chaka Khans ""Im Every Woman "" in the communal firehouse shower.) Larrys son even coins a new exclamation ""Fabulicious."" A lot of this is funny but its also exasperatingly stale.Yet ""Chuck and Larry"" is too disarming to hate. In fact it hates hate. The movie is often stupid. But coming from an industry institutionally terrified of being honest about its own sexuality it feels brave going a step further than ""not that theres anything wrong with that."" Everyone involved can feel good about the public-service manual theyve made ""Gay-Friendly for Dummies.""Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

With Adam Sandler Kevin James Jessica Biel Steve Buscemi Dan Aykroyd. (110 min.) Adam Sandler and Kevin James play courageous Brooklyn firefighters and best friends in this comedy that seems designed to be as bad as it can be. Because red tape prevents Kevin Jamess Larry a widower from naming his two kids as his life-insurance beneficiaries he cooks up a scheme to get around the problem by marrying Adam Sandlers Chuck a notorious ladys man who owes his partner big time for having once saved his life. Their domestic partnership sham eventually falls apart - although the movie falls apart much sooner than that. Grade F- Peter Rainer Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sunshine (R) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Danny Boyle. With Michelle Yeoh Cillian Murphy Chris Evans Rose Byrne Troy Garity. (107 min.) Its 2057 and the sun is dying. A solar winter is freezing Earth. (So much for global warming.) In order to reignite the sun a team of astronauts is on course to deliver a nuclear payload into the sun a mission that already failed seven years earlier with the doomed Icarus I spaceship. When the current crew which includes Cillian Murphy Michelle Yeoh and Cliff Curtis picks up faint distress signals from the Icarus the stage is set for a nightmarish rescue mission. Director Danny Boyle gets some tension going and as the crew members are eliminated one by one a cosmic despair sets in. But too much of ""Sunshine"" is like a cross between a middling ""Alien"" movie and ""Solaris"" (the woozy Steven Soderbergh version). Grade B-- P.R.Vitus (PG)Director Fredi M. Murer. With Fabrizio Borsani Teo Gheorghiu. (120 min.) Like ""Joshua"" now in theatrical release ""Vitus"" is about a piano prodigy confronting his weirdness. But the two films outcomes couldnt be more different. The title character of ""Joshua"" inflicted vengeance on his clueless family. Vitus von Holzen (played by real-life prodigies Teo Gheorghiu and Fabrizio Borsani) seeks balance by hanging out with his sweetly nonconformist grandpa (Bruno Ganz) who inspires him to be his own person whatever it takes and to become a sort of a parent to his own mom and dad. This is a touching and inspirational fantasy buoyed by splendid music and considerable humor.Grade B+- M.K.

Universal Pictures REVIEW / But who will get to ride on top of the fire truck? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery GOOD I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry Comedy. Starring Adam Sandler Kevin James Jessica Biel and Ving Rhames. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SFGate.com/movies.) The makers of ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" have a strange way of dealing with the inevitable criticisms the film will receive for its setup which has two straight New York firefighters faking a same-sex relationship to get domestic-partner benefits. Whatever gay stereotypes exist in this movie -- and they probably number in the hundreds -- the writers of the comedy are much tougher on morbidly obese people hot women the homeless mailmen unattractive women and particularly Asians. Even the band Journey probably deserves a bigger apology from the makers of ""Chuck amp; Larry"" than anyone in the gay community. The Adam Sandler and Kevin James vehicle also has the ultimate defense against the political-correctness police Its often pretty funny. Sandler has stopped doing that weird baby-voice thing and he actually has better romantic chemistry with James than on-screen love interest Jessica Biel. And whenever things get slow cue a toe-tapping song by George Michael who is totally underrated. But despite the fact that the movie covers some new cinematic territory much of the humor feels recycled mostly from the ""Seinfeld"" episodes ""The Boyfriend"" (the one where Jerry has a man crush on Keith Hernandez) and ""The Outing"" (""not that theres anything wrong with that ...""). The plot turns are unnecessarily ridiculous -- and at nearly two hours ""Chuck amp; Larry"" is also about 20 minutes too long. Sandler is womanizing Chuck and James is widowed father Larry; the men are best friends at their Brooklyn firehouse. Worried that hell die in a fire and leave his children without benefits Larry convinces Chuck to sign domestic-partnership paperwork. When city fraud inspection agents start digging through the trash the friends have to maintain their ruse marriage -- even after theyre outed in the New York Post. The middle part of the film is the most satisfying when the once-homophobic Chuck slowly becomes a much better partner to Larry than he was to any woman. Despite a constant stream of stereotype-driven humor (""How about some conditioner for dry hair"" Chuck says during a supermarket trip. ""Thats pretty gay."") ""Chuck amp; Larry"" for the most part contains pro-tolerance messages. Its only a little surprising that a GLAAD executive who went to advance screenings has publicly supported the film. Note that the producers didnt invite any Asian American groups to check out the movie which features Rob Schneider as an Asian minister who is a racially offensive Abercrombie amp; Fitch T-shirt come to life. This is also a film where every attractive woman -- even Larrys physician -- is certain to end up in lingerie for a multi-partner sex romp in Chucks bachelor pad. And Biels rear end seems to get more screen time than her face. Wasnt she in ""The Illusionist""? The screenwriters shockingly include Oscar-winning scribes Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (""Sideways"") and it wouldnt be more odd if Martin Scorsese got behind the camera for a Steven Seagal movie. Assuming you dont walk out midway through though its hard to find fault with their final message -- which has most of New York cheering for gay rights. Sandler and James are here and theyre queer. We may as well get used to it. -- Advisory Speaking of Jessica Biels perfectly formed posterior in the era of Title IX shouldnt Matt Damons butt be getting equal time on screen? In addition to a lot of women in their underwear this movie contains raunchy humor profanity and comic violence.

"Not That Theres Anything. washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Not That Theres Anything. Larry (Kevin James) gets a noogie from Chuck (Adam Sandler) in an embarrassingly dated comedy about gay marriage. (Photos By Tracy Bennett -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 20 2007 ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" takes a hot-button issue -- the cultural impact of gay marriage -- and treats it with such Stone Age sensibility a Geico caveman would groan. An Adam Sandler comedy that offers gay-bashing and a small parade of homosexual stereotypes as entertainment it has the breathtaking disingenuousness to conclude with a take-home message that (people of the world take note) gays are humans too. The film -- about two heterosexual firemen (Sandler and Kevin James) who learn what it means to be gay -- might have had more currency when it was first written 10 years ago. But as rewritten by Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (the team behind ""Election"" ""About Schmidt"" and ""Sideways"") ""Chuck amp; Larry"" feels almost embarrassingly dated (is a gay union really so shocking these days?). And its attempt to interfuse comedy with consciousness-raising is hopelessly inept. Sandler is the Chuck of the title a macho member of Brooklyns Engine 506/Ladder 223 who never met a blaze he couldnt snuff out a life he couldnt save or a woman he couldnt turn on. (We see him one particular morning sharing fridge time with five giggling conquests.) His misadventure begins when his colleague and best friend Larry (James) makes a startling proposal. City regulations (in one of the movies many absurdities) require the widowed Larry to remarry if he wants his two children to receive his death benefits. Larry hopes a domestic partnership will suffice Would Chuck uh oblige and sign the form? They soon learn thats not enough and so Larry and Chuck head to Canada and get married. The movie tries to follow a course similar to that of ""Tootsie"" the 1982 comedy in which a sexist male actor (Dustin Hoffman) discovers the real meaning of manhood after living the life of a woman. In both movies the central character pretends to be something he isnt and in doing so sheds his ignorance about that social group. But director Dennis Dugan (who was behind the camera for Sandlers ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Big Daddy"") just uses the premise for cheap company. ""Chuck amp; Larry"" is too witless heavy-handed and insincere to reproduce ""Tootsies"" interfusion of comedy and consciousness-raising. The latter is superficially evoked The firefighters supposed gay life lessons spring from the unexpected show of support they receive from the gay community and from their newfound marital squabbles (""You cant commit to anything"" Larry complains). And the gay characters with whom Chuck and Larry interact are drawn from equally hackneyed ideas about homosexuals. They include a flamboyant new buddy (Nick Swardson) and Larrys very feminine preteen son (Cole Morgen) who expresses a sudden desire to play the leading role in ""Annie Get Your Gun."" Ving Rhames completes the hall of shame as a fireman who reveals his own secret sexual identity only to enjoy the ensuing tension he provokes in the firehouse shower. For the most part charm has been part of Sandlers box office hits including ""The Wedding Singer"" ""Billy Madison"" and ""50 First Dates."" Underneath the nasal boorishness his characters are usually endearing children trapped inside mens bodies. But this time around boorishness is all we get. And like Chuck who at one point finds himself trapped under an obese man he just saved from a fire we just want out. I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude sexual content nudity profanity and drug references.

Two different comic sensibilities collide in I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Two of the credited screenwriters social satirists Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor (Citizen Ruth Election Sideways) created a farce about straight Brooklyn firemen who pose as gay partners to qualify for benefits. A third Barry Fanaro (scribe of Men in Black II) wrote a broad - make that double-wide - comedy. And as produced the script plays like a sexual-panic slapstick message movie. The moral of this crude intermittently funny Adam Sandler comedy costarring the reliable Kevin James is that Its OK to be gay its not OK to call someone a faggot and it takes a real man to admit he loves his man pal. Preceding this moral delivered in the closing moments of Act 3 are two acts crammed with disco-dancing Halloween-loving lamA(c)-wearing queer stereotypes. The net effect is one of producer/actor Sandlers having his gay-bashing and eating his words too. James king of sitcomedy (at least The King of Queens) and so funny opposite Will Smith in Hitch anchors the film as Larry a widower and single father who risks losing his kids survivor benefits. To secure them he persuades good buddy Chuck (Sandler womanizer and babe-magnet) to move in so they can feign a domestic partnership. When an investigator (Steve Buscemi) comes round to verify that theyre not scamming the system Chuck and Larry retain a lawyer Alex McDonough (the criminally beautiful Jessica Biel) to whom Chuck is majorly attracted. Chucks attraction to Alex (frequently seen in barely there underwear) signals to Sandlers core audience that his character is 100 percent heterosexual. Not for Chuck and Larry the sexual undertones of Some Like It Hot (made nearly 50 years ago) in which Jack Lemmon posing as a woman enjoys the attention he gets from men. Not for this shallow comedy the subtler and deeper humor of In amp; Out. I feel compelled to apologize about laughing at Chuck and Larry like many Sandler films less a movie than a fistful of funny moments. I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry  (out of four stars) Directed by Dennis Dugan written by Barry Fanaro Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor with Adam Sandler Kevin James Jessica Biel Dan Aykroyd and Ving Rhames. Distributed by Universal Pictures. Running time 1 hour 54 mins. Parents guide PG-13 (sexual content and innuendo) Playing at area theaters Given its preachy ending it looks like Sandler felt compelled to apologize for it too.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

In the midst of speeches about tolerance -- as well as yuks wrung from jokes about the fat that clings to widower Larry (Kevin James) and the women who cling to single guy Chuck (Adam Sandler) -- the hetero firemen who are faking a homosexual domestic partnership for health insurance coverage for Larry and his kids are urged to express their love for one another at what is surely the weirdest fraud-inquiry hearing ever to take place even in weird-friendly Brooklyn. Whereupon the two pucker like theyre facing the gallows; the prospect is just that yucky. So if Im reading the ""message"" right in this lumbering time-warp disco of a comedy about the heroism of firefighters the preciousness of male bonding the sanctity of family and the glory of Jessica Biels proudly real breasts its that gay men are marvelous exotic and hilarious creatures who have every right to equality under the law. And that its very hurtful when theyre discriminated against. Or beaten up. Or even shunned in communal firehouse showers where straight colleagues are scared to pick up a dropped bar of soap. But if its all the same to you being straight is you know more regular. And like whew. Perhaps Im reading too much into a slab of honking Sandler comedy made for an audience already predisposed to laugh when early in the story Chuck and Larry rescue an obese bed-bound man during a fire. (The massive fellow rolls on top of them And then farts) Or when Chuck finds himself attracted to Alex (Biel) the lawyer defending the couple against a suspicious insurance fraud investigator (Steve Buscemi) and gets invited to assess Alexs assets ""girlfriend"" to girlfriend. (Tootsie got there a quarter century ago with more class.) But I cant shake the musty odor of comic overexertion coupled with Hollywood nervousness that wafts up from every scene. When the pair go shopping for items to gay up their home naturally they grab lubricating gel from the personal products shelf. Dont all The Gays? That the movie directed by Happy Gilmore helmer Dennis Dugan received a script revision by classy Sideways talents Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor does dismayingly little to up the sophistication quotient. Anyhow its not until Chuck and Larry actually experience discrimination that they begin in their audience-safe Neanderthal way to understand what victimhood feels like. Myself I felt victimized by the stereotype shtick of reliably grating Rob Schneider as a Canadian-Japanese wedding-chapel minister from SNL castoff hell. But maybe thats just because this movie encourages sensitivity by hitting everyone over the head with its humor hammer.

Relentlessly juvenile and awash in stereotypes ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"" is the kind of buddy comedy Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau might have starred in 40 years ago when the material would have felt less dated if no less silly. Kevin James and Adam Sandler hardly approach that standard and it will be slightly depressing if a barrage of schoolyard gay jokes passes for ""edgy"" a quarter-century after ""Victor/Victoria."" Taken for what it is pic should find its sweet spot somewhere between the easily offended and very easily amused providing Universal with a modest summer tryst. Produced by Sandlers Happy Madison and Tom Shadyacs Shady Acres shingles ""Chuck and Larry"" miscasts Sandler as a ladies man whos Mr. February on a firefighters calendar bedding women in multiples of two and four. Hey its nice to be the boss. In another incongruous pairing ""Sideways"" writing team Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor join ""Golden Girls"" scribe Barry Fanaro and director Dennis Dugan (who previously helmed Sandlers ""Happy Gilmore""). Pic initially plays like a screwball comedy with a bit more smarts but ultimately the more banal sitcom impulses win out. Larry (James) is a widowed firefighter with two kids who discovers that thanks to bureaucratic red tape he risks losing his benefits if something happens to him. The improbable solution Enter into a domestic partnership with his pal and co-worker Chuck (Sandler) leaving the money and kids to him. Yet after filing the paperwork the two are advised by a beautiful attorney (Jessica Biel) that such a fraudulent ruse has landed others in considerable trouble forcing them to prove the charade is real. This puts them in the crosshairs of an obsessive fraud investigator (Steve Buscemi) while rendering them poster children for gay rights prompting others to keep throwing open their closet doors. Along the way the movie repeatedly slips in ""Bias is bad"" messages among all the gay jokes including an extended dont-drop-the-soap-when-showering-at-the-firehouse gag. Forced to forgo sex meanwhile Chuck actually begins to develop an adult bond with his unwitting lawyer which doesnt stop him from feeling up her boobs in a moment of sisterly bonding. Dugan is hardly a master of subtlety and given the limitations of their leads the producers smartest move is to populate the cast with talented supporting players who can milk laughs from the mostly inane setups. Tops among these are Ving Rhames as a fellow fireman and Dan Aykroyd as the fast-talking fire chief. Buscemis cartoonish shtick by contrast falls painfully flat and Sandlers former ""Saturday Night Live"" posse (Rachel Dratch Robert Smigel plus an uncredited David Spade and Rob Schneider) also turn out in abundance with Schneiders caricaturish portrayal of an Asian wedding coordinator possibly the most embarrassing of that sort since Mickey Rooney in ""Breakfast at Tiffanys."" Again subjected to a parade of fat jabs James possesses a vulnerable likable lug quality that served him well in TV as well as in ""Hitch."" Sandlers fans should enjoy hearing him toss off lines about being ""big-time fruits"" or having ""boarded the dude train."" The two also have fun with their relationship occasionally squabbling like a married couple. Even the most generous-minded however will have their patience tested as the movie overstays its welcome in the extended last act which cant be salvaged by a couple thematic cameos by actors including Richard Chamberlain. With the material pitched so broadly ""Chuck and Larry"" clearly hopes not to give offense which isnt to say that some gays wont understandably be put off by it. The movies only aim however is to ride the ""dude train"" to happily ever after -- a marriage of comedy and commerce that appears unlikely to endure for very long.
