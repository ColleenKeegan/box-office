"Review Hansel and Gretel makes grim viewing - CNN.com SHARE THIS Print Email More sharing Reddit StumbleUpon Delicious Review Hansel and Gretel makes grim viewing By Tom Charity Special to CNN updated 436 PM EST Fri January 25 2013 Gemma Arterton stars as Gretel and Jeremy Renner stars as Hansel in ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters."" STORY HIGHLIGHTS The film was pushed back to take advantage of Jeremy Renners rising star It was shot in 3-D Famke Janssen plays the wickedest witch Editors note This review may contain spoilers. (CNN) -- If this long-delayed and blatantly pandering CGI malarkey is anything to go by Hollywoods current craze for fairy tales isnt going to have a happy ending. Originally slated for release last spring ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters"" was ostensibly pushed back to take advantage of Jeremy Renners rising star (he had ""The Bourne Legacy"" and ""Avengers"" coming out in the summer). Renner is entitled to cash in on his ""Hurt Locker"" acclaim and make a living like anybody else but Ill bet he was more animated cashing his check than he is as a gun-toting medieval witch slayer the little boy from Grimms fairytale grown up with a chip on his shoulder and an inexplicable American accent (which is shared by his ""sis"" Gemma Artertons leather-clad Gretel but no one else in this neck of the woods). Hansel is also inflicted with diabetes -- ""sugar sickness"" -- and periodically slumps into a coma until he self-administers an injection through his britches. Youll know how he feels. The idea may be kind of cute -- remember Hansel was force-fed candy as a kid -- but typically half-baked in a flick that throws anachronisms around like theyre going out of style. Writer-director Tommy Wirkola whose first film was the cult Nazi zombie pic ""Dead Snow"" hasnt concocted more than a slender thread of a narrative. A witch is snatching so many children that the town mayor brings in the sibling celebrity bounty hunters (wait a minute didnt Terry Gilliam all ready make this movie as ""The Brothers Grimm""?). Rather than construct any scares suspense or surprise the movie attempts to stave off boredom with a dose of kung fu fighting every five minutes. The movie hits its nadir early when Thomas Manns teenage fanboy Ben shows up in a tavern bearing press clippings of the dynamic duos exploits and asks for their autographs -- slipping in some bonehead exposition for good measure ""So how do you kill witches?"" It never really improves much either -- except maybe in the gratuitous semi-nudity when a mildly wounded Hansel is coaxed into skinny dipping in ""healing waters"" by a comely maiden who leads by example. Playing the wickedest witch (""Muriel"") whose true features resemble the Bonneville Salt Flats Famke Janssen signals her wickedness by. Talking. Like. This. Very. Slowly. Which has the unfortunate consequence of underlining the clichA(c)d nature of lines like ""Im not. Going to. Kill you. Yet. That. Would. Be. Too. Ea. Sy"" Yes indeed too easy by far when Wirkola seems to specialize in the heavy-handed cumbersome and laborious even when hes aiming for flip. Especially when hes aiming for flip. Its a tossup whats most depressing the abject storytelling (and when you find yourself yearning for the storytelling skills of Terry Gilliam thats not a good sign) or the reprehensible lazy thinking that equates evil with physical deformity. Look how were invited to enjoy the slaughter of witches -- including conjoined twins and a ""half lady"" -- and how Wirkola insidiously mixes sideshow freaks with the reactionary connotation of the word The witches are made up to resemble Goths and punks outsiders who deserve nothing better than the gory reckoning he contrives for them. As for shooting the thing in 3-D the movie has some eye-catching effects. Its just a pity Wirkola and company never see the wood for the trees.",http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/25/showbiz/movies/hansel-gretel-review-charity/index.html?iref=allsearch,200,hanselandgretelwitchhunters0,hanselandgretelwitchhunters,cnn

Comments click to enlarge Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters 3D Video Rated R  88 minutes  2013 The idea of recasting the little fairy-tale characters as action heroes is so silly it might have worked had it been played for laughs but director and cowriter Tommy Wirkola (best known for the ""Nazi zombie"" flick Dead Snow) just uses it as a pretext for fight scenes in the fashion of video games. There isnt much to this beyond the poorly staged rapidly edited violence; the witches all but devoid of backstory are basically canvasses for cartoon splatter. As the title characters the typically likable Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton (Tamara Drewe) have little to do besides flex their muscles and recite Schwarzenegger-level one-liners.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 25 2013 309PM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 25 2013 324PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tommy Wirkola Written by Tommy Wirkola Starring Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton Classification 14A Genre fantasy Year 2012 Country USA Language English The fairy-tale horror/action film Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters is part of the same genre-twisting wave that has seen Abraham Lincoln and Jane Austen fighting vampires and zombies. Its Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola previously made Dead Snow about a group of medical students on a ski trip who are confronted by Nazi zombies. The choice of witches here as the silly supernatural enemy is even more problematic than funny Nazis. Though violence-against-women activists probably have more serious concerns to deal with there were tens of thousands of real women tortured and murdered from the 15th to 18th centuries for witchcraft and Witch Hunters has an alarming number of females being strung up burned shot decapitated and eviscerated.On the other hand the film cant be accused of taking itself seriously. Shot in 3-D with lots of choppy action a rudimentary plot and plenty of CGI-shape-shifting it comes in at a brisk disposable 88 minutes.We begin with the Brothers Grimm story of siblings caught eating a gingerbread house. Shortly after dispatching their first witch the kids are seen as a pair of foul-mouthed demon hunters who are called in to a backwater village to solve a missing-children problem (missing children are shown as woodcut prints attached to milk bottles). The presence of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay as producers suggests this film might have been intended at some point in its development as an outright comedy. (Crone Wars perhaps?) Instead the movie settles for showers of gore with intermittent moments of spoofiness.Though the place they inhabit appears to share the same excremental medieval world of Monty Pythons Life of Brian Hansel and Gretel are outfitted in form-fitting leather and are provided with steampunk-style technology including a primitive hand-cranked taser pump-action shotguns and an unexpected Gatling gun to ply their trade. Though apparently invulnerable to witch spells the siblings have their weak spots. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) has to take insulin injections with an oversized syringe thanks to an early force-feeding of candy. Hes also nervous around attractive women other than his sister and has a particularly fierce anti-witch bias. ""The only good witch"" he insists ""is a dead witch.""His sister is slightly more tolerant and her first act in the new town is to stop the sheriff (Peter Stormare) from killing an apparently innocent pale redhead (Pihla Viitala). The woman in fact turns out to be a sexy white witch who latches on to the nervous Hansel and helps him partly revise his opinion on witches. Gretel has her own burdens to bear an adoring teen fan (Thomas Mann); and later a massive-headed troll named Edward (Derek Mears). Both appear spellbound by her cleavage.Eventually Hansel and Gretel find themselves in a showdown with a powerful black witch (Famke Janssen) who can flip instantly into being a diva-ish know-it-all in a slinky black dress and then a partially decomposed monster with green veins on her face.Other witches in her coven show variations on a goth-punk-raver vibe suggesting a more progressive fashion sense than the dun-covered clothes of the villagers. Their progressive ideas alas are soon buried by the sibling vigilantes in the ash dump of history.

Ballard An Alien Among Us Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture ""The idea is theyve grown up and they hunt witches"" said producer Adam McKay in 2010. ""Its a hybrid sort of old-timey feeling yet theres pump-action shotguns. Modern technology but in an old style. We heard it and we were just like Thats a freakin franchise You could make three of those"" One might be enough -- too much for some tastes. But Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters the 3-D action fantasy that Norwegian writer-director Tommy Wirkola pitched to McKay and his producing partner Will Ferrell in 2009 and which was filmed in the spring of 2011 has finally arrived in theaters. So long was the movies gestation that a cheapo version Hansel amp; Gretel from the ripoff specialists at Asylum Productions is already on DVD. (READ Mary Polss review of Snow White and the Huntsman) The Wirkola movie headlining Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as the 20-something brother and sister tries for a mix of comedy and horror or scary-jokey in a clash of medieval and modern attitudes. The blend of fairy-tale sentiment and knowing irony worked exactly once in The Princess Bride and fails here. But theres enough visual ingenuity -- eye candy if you will -- to make this Hansel amp; Gretel an intermittently tasty temptation. (READ Corlisss review of The Princess Bride by subscribing to TIME) After ransacking virtually every comic-book hero in the Marvel and DC canons moviemakers have turned to an older public-domain source of adventure stories the fables collected two centuries ago by Jacob and William Grimm. In just the past couple of years ""Snow White"" was morphed into Mirror Mirror and Snow White and the Huntsman; Amanda Seyfried lost her hood in Red Riding; and ""Rapunzel"" got an animated twist in Tangled. (Yet to be filmed the Grimm tales ""The Bittern and the Hoopoe"" ""The Poor Boy in the Grave"" and ""The Jew Among Thorns."") About a decade ago Terry Gilliam merged fantasy and bio-pic when he cast Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as The Brothers Grimm. (READ TIMEs profile of Terry Gilliam making The Brothers Grimm) The appeal is clear. More than a century before Walt Disney whom they directly inspired the Grimms knew that the best way to teach a lesson to children was to scare them witless. ""Hansel and Gretel"" for example turns a warning to kids against taking candy from strangers into a melodrama -- a horror story really -- about a gingerbread house and the wicked witch inside and the cage where Hansel is fattened up for roasting and the fireplace in which the witch becomes someone elses dinner. In modern America the tale might be a screed against childhood obesity and the witch either Ronald McDonald or Michelle Obama depending on whether or not youre aghast that todays tweens are as plump as turduckens. But this movie is not vegan propaganda; its a revenge fantasy about two kids determined to wipe out the species they blame for their early incarceration and their parents deaths. From the original Grimm tale Hansel takes these two morals ""One Never walk into a house made of candy and two If youre gonna kill a witch set her on fire."" Having lost their parents in a village purge the adult H amp; G roam the countryside as mercenary missionaries killing witches for vengeance and profit. (Just witches. ""Trolls"" Hansel notes ""are extra."") The setting richly realized by production designer Stephen Scott who worked with Guillermo Del Toro on the Hellboy movies is old-world rural a gnarly landscape populated by quaint folk who speak in mittel-European intonations and are tyrannized by a nasty sheriff (Peter Stormare) who tortures the witch suspect Mina (Pihla Viitala) by brutally dunking her head in the public square. Call it water-barreling. (READ Corliss on Guillermo Del Toro and the Hellboy movies) To these refugees from a Renaissance Faire the star tandem of ultra-violent American-accented siblings represents an invasion from the 21st-century fantasy universe. Ostensibly on hand to corral a child-napping coven led by the Grand Witch Muriel (Famke Janssen) H and G are really there as salespeople for ornate weaponry. Hansel empties the contents of his ornate shotgun at anything that moves and some that dont -- at one point he kills a tree -- and later mans a machine gun like some time traveler from a World War II battlefield. Gretel displays her expertise with a double-barrel crossbow and uses a prototype of electronic pincers as a defibrillator when shes not cracking wise a la Stallone or Bruce Willis. Returning to the candy cottage late in the film she apostrophizes ""You gotta be f-in kiddin me."" (READ How Jeremy Renner inherited The Bourne Legacy) The whole kidding trope which you can bet was ordered by McKay and Ferrell is pretty lame and defeats the leads attempts to bring shadings to cardboard cartoon characters. Renner who since making Hansel amp; Gretel appeared in the megahits Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and The Avengers became an official if not actual marquee name by replacing Damon as Jason Bourne; but he still lacks the crackle of genuine star quality. Arterton whose smooth stolid features suggest a rough sketch for Jennifer Lawrence had her 15 mins. of movie fame three years ago (in Clash of the Titans Prince of Persia Tamara Drewe) before retiring to the Julia Ormond Home for English Actresses Briefly Mistaken for Hollywood Hotties. Renner and Arterton share just one tantalizing moment an intimate closeup in which the two look as if they are about to kiss. The wisp of sibling eroticism may be inadvertent but it kindles in the stalwart duo a rare moment of fumbling humanity. (READ Corliss on Gemma Arterton in Tamara Drewe) Otherwise the ones worth watching are a quartet of supporting actress from across the European Union. Janssen (Netherlands) summons some sexy maleficence as the chief witch abetted by her aide-de-high-camp Ingrid Bolso Berdal (Norway) who hisses becomingly as the Horned Witch. Pale vital Pihla Viitala (Finland) as Mina beguilingly proves the truth in Hansels stern dogma that ""The only good witch is a dead witch""; she is good and too soon she is dead. In a helpful flashback Kathrin Kuhnel (Germany) makes a quick potent impression as Hansel and Gretels mother Adrianna -- another good witch who in the villagers vigilante fervor is burned at the stake. Benevolent or evil Wirkolas witches do more than fly on broomsticks. In a few excellent chase scenes these sisters of Satan tumble fight explode or vanish as if they were part of an infernal Cirque du Soleil. But the most poignant character is a troll named Edward who does Muriels bidding until he takes pity on the humans. A merging of puppetry and computer effects Edward is performed by Derek Mears and voiced by Robin Atkins Downes. With a face that suggests Rondo Hatton crossed with Richard Kind he appears to be a dim lumbering giant; then his anger softens to reveal a fretful generosity of spirit. As the witches here reclaim the species from the perky Hermione and her brood in the Harry Potter series so does the portrayal of Edward serve as a corrective to the churlish depiction of trolls in The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey. Attention must be paid; reparation must be made. (READ TIMEs review of the pro-Elf anti-Troll The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey) The film ends with Hansel Gretel Edward and the feckless human sidekick Ben (Thomas Mann) anticipating their next adventure. That may be a rash dream. Many movies whose endings explicitly promise sequels -- The Golden Compass The Sorcerers Apprentice John Carter and for that matter Artertons Prince of Persia -- never reach their goal of ""a freakin franchise."" This Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters may the only Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters; and if so no big whoop. But the good witches and the bad ones will linger in moviegoers memories. And well always have Edward.

Who you gonna call? The stars of Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide).If any of this sounds like fun rest assured its anything but.Perhaps there was a germ of a clever idea in the pitch meeting where this convoluted hybrid was born. But whats on screen is a foul-mouthed gory R-rated fantasy/action/comedy/horror/dysfunctional-family saga. Are there any film categories left out here?This genre stew throws in so many ingredients -- including sundry body parts that are cut off and go flying and heads that explode -- that the result is a tasteless mash-up thats hard to stomach.The plot is a disjointed tedious and frenetic mess and the dialog tries to be cheeky with the titular characters anachronistically dropping f-bombs. But their quips are never remotely funny.The 3-D special effects are annoyingly in-your-face devoid of any real purpose beyond startling the viewer. Recoiling may be the only reaction the film induces.The story spins off the Brothers Grimm classic with the young siblings fending off a woods-dwelling evil witch in a cottage made of candy. They sample the sweet facade she attacks them they throw her in the fire. This part is familiar enough. Then flash-forward to Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) as leather-clad tough-talking adults. Having liquidated one nasty hag theyve become witch hunters for a living. As vigilantes theyre armed with enough pistols shotguns grenades and even a semi-automatic crossbow to outfit a battalion.The era in which all this occurs is murky. Some details have a medieval vibe yet our heroes have an arsenal of far more modern weaponry and their dialogue is strictly of the unimaginative 21st-century variety.Parents dont make the mistake of taking the kids to this blood-spattered revenge-fest.In the process of hunting down their cackling prey they learn about the mysterious disappearance of their parents. They also become targets for one of the most evil witches of all (Famke Janssen in terrible monster make-up).There are only two moments that are remotely clever As the camera pans across a village at the edge of the woods glass bottles of milk have woodcut depictions of missing children emblazoned on their labels. The other is the implication that Hansel is a diabetic based on his over-the-top consumption of sweets.Its hard to imagine just what inspired a talented Oscar nominee like Renner to take on such a thankless part. Lets hope he at least took home a hefty paycheck.Most of the film is spent with Hansel and Gretel fending off those who are against them including a local mayor (Peter Stormare). But the story is not the films strong suit nor are the action sequences performances or special effects. But at least it puts forth a sound message Kids avoid overdoing it on sweets -- especially candy that doubles as drywall. 39 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Vn025S,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/01/25/hansel-and-gretel-review/1864211/,200,hanselandgretelwitchhunters4,hanselandgretelwitchhunters,usatoday

Once upon a time about eight centuries ago when Little Red Riding Hood was being eaten by a wolf in granny glasses there lived a pair of starving orphans named Hansel and Gretel who were lured into a house in the woods made entirely of candy and cookies by a grotesque old hag who intended to fatten them up and chow down. But the siblings outsmarted the old witch popped her in the oven instead and escaped vowing never as long they lived to eat gingerbread again. This gruesome tale was translated by the Brothers Grimm in 1812 from a German fable that dates back to 1315. Its been delighting children ever since in numerous movies cartoons and operas and now finds its way back to the shopping mall cineplex in the hobbled IMAX splatterfest Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters. Times have changed. In an age of zombies werewolves and oversexed vampires teens wont be shaking in their Uggs over ugly women with bad teeth flying around on brooms and with its graphic depictions of tortures mutilations gang rapes and myriad examples of child abuse its no longer a fairy tale suitable for children. Im not sure its much of a movie for anybody else either. Hansel grew up to be Jeremy Renner from The Hurt Locker. Gretel grew up to be Gemma Arterton one of the dullest of all Bond girls in Quantum of Solace. Both of them are clearly slumming. Devoting their lives to saving other children from carnivorous witches goblins and other pedophiles they take on sheriffs preachers hysterical mobs and whole towns hell-bent on burning real witches while saving innocent girls falsely accused of ""consorting with the spawn of the devil."" They are bounty hunters called in by a terrified village where the children are disappearing. Killing witches keeps them in groceries. They get extra for trolls. But Hansel has a heart--as well as a raging Johnson that needs attention. After saving a pretty redhead from a bonfire with her name on it the first thing he does is join her skinny-dipping. He takes to nudity fast but dont offer him a Baby Ruth. Suffering from candy poisoning contracted years ago when he was trying to eat his way out of that gingerbread house he has to jam a primitive hypodermic needle of medieval insulin into his body every day to stay alive. Meanwhile Gretel gets her kicks too as a scantily-clad medieval pepper pot with throbbing cleavage who attracts the fanatic attention of a friendly humongous troll named Edward with a head the size of a Volks- wagen. Then she is rescued from one of her many attempted rapes at the hands of a gang of rival witch hunters who keep flesh-eating dogs by a teenage groupie who hides her in his hut in the forest and tries awkwardly to be a host. (""Im sorry would you like some porridge?"") Yes there are fans and autograph hunters in the 14th century too. I figure one Hansel and Gretel is worth two Rapunzels. Norwegian B-movie writer-director Tommy Wirkola makes his bid for Hollywood action glory with this R-rated hokum providing plenty of regurgitated violence mixed with a few random licks of humor--a formula he examined more creatively in his gory but hair-raising 2009 horror picnic Dead Snow about a present-day group of good-looking medical students on a skiing vacation who find themselves at the mercy of a battalion of frozen Nazi zombies on icy slopes in Bavaria. This time the comedy is forced and corny. I had fun for a while watching the primitive spikes guns slings and other toys of mass destruction and enjoyed Famke Janssen as a powerful witch named Muriel flying across the moon on primitive pitchforks searching for the heart of a good witch like Billie Burke and conjuring gross-out spells like ""The Hunger for Crawling Things."" But I doubt that they had Strike Anywhere matches in the 14th century and Im pretty sure nobody said things like ""Whatever happens stay cool."" Whatever happens stay home. rreedobserver.com HANSEL amp; GRETEL WITCH HUNTERS Running Time 88 minutes Written by Tommy Wirkola and Dante Harper Directed by Tommy Wirkola Starring Jeremy Renner Gemma Arterton and Peter Stormare 1/4 Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2013/01/requiem-for-a-fairy-tale-hansel-gretel-witch-hunters/,200,hanselandgretelwitchhunters7,hanselandgretelwitchhunters,com/2013/01/requiem-for-a-fairy-tale-hansel-gretel-witch-hunters/

Abraham Lincoln is reduced to slaying vampires. Elizabeth Bennet is stuck fighting off zombies. And Hansel and Gretel having already suffered the indignity of being abandoned in the woods by lousy parents cant just kill off one cannibalistic witch and call it a day In Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters theyve grown up to become bounty hunters who must roam the land kicking gnarly witch butt.Actually according to this assertively revisionist reading of the Brothers Grimm young Hansel and Gretel were led into the woods by their parents for a very good reason having to do with the naked ambition of a very bad witch Muriel (Famke Janssen). As it turns out the grown versions of Hansel and Gretel now celebrity witch hunters--theyre played by Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner--have been brought to a small village to find the crone whos been snatching the local children and damned if it isnt Muriel herself accompanied by a whole coven of evildoing uglies in makeup left over from The Devils Rain.The point maybe is that were supposed to take great pleasure in watching these nasty old gals being fried to death or blown to smithereens with a medieval Gatling gun. But theres actually no pleasure at all to be had in this Hansel amp; Gretel which was directed by Tommy Wirkola whose previous credits include the 2009 Nazi-zombie horror comedy Dead Snow. (He also wrote the script.) The violence here is cartoonishly bloody without being exhilarating. The plot is as misshapen as a mutant gingerbread boy. And at least as it was shown at the multiplex where I saw it the picture has a dank murky look as if it had been left under a pile of mulch to marinate for a decade or two.If youre thinking of experiencing Hansel amp; Gretel as it was made to be seen with special glasses that will set you back a couple of extra bucks you might want to reconsider The movies laff-riot gross-outs arent particularly enhanced by 3D. (When youve seen one guy vomiting half-digested meat and maggots youve seen them all.) And for a horror-comedy Hansel amp; Gretel is curiously humorless. In the single touch approaching cleverness the faces of the missing kinder rendered in old-timey engravings that resemble the original promotional art for Les Mis are lashed with twine to glass milk bottles. But the gag hits 10 minutes into the movie; after that theres nothing to look forward to.Still there is a truly intriguing mystery here What on Earth are Renner and Arterton doing in this godforsaken thing? Arterton is a reasonably appealing presence whos been toiling away in features like the revived St. Trinians franchise in addition to playing sword-and-sandal babes in pictures like Clash of the Titans and Prince of Persia The Sands of Time. She has haunches of steel and the kind of raspberries-and-cream complexion you might see in a George Romney painting. Surely someone can think of a better use for her than being knocked around pretty savagely by a crooked town sheriff? (Hes played by Peter Stormare whose Brobdingnagian overacting at least suits the brutish scale of the picture around him.)Renners presence here is even more mystifying. Wirkola and Harper havent really given him a character to play. Hansel is mostly just a collection of cute tics--hes neurotic and a diabetic to boot (the result of being force-fed candy as a child at the hands of that first witch). But unlike his sister he at least gets a love interest in the form of a fetching strawberry-blond white witch played by Pihla Viitala.Renner trundles through Hansel amp; Gretel looking glum and constipated as if he were just praying for the whole thing to be over quickly. At this point he may be wishing he could get another role like the one Kathryn Bigelow gave him in The Hurt Locker as a hotdogging Iraq War explosives expert. Renner has a tough little mug like a modern Dead End Kid and Bigelow knew just how to use him He was terrific as a perpetually angry Lost Boy. Here hes just lost and theres no trail of breadcrumbs to save him. The Brothers Grimm may have come up with some cruel weird material in their day but theyd never condone actor abuse like this.Directed by Tommy Wirkola. Written by Tommy Wirkola and Dante Harper.

The bad news is that were not. 49 Shares Share 26 Tweet 19 Share 3 Share Email Print Share Photo Paramount Pictures You know Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters didnt have to be terrible. True its the kind of concept that presages yet another po-mo slo-mo wink-wink action variation on something supposedly classical. But much like its title the movie overstates its case. Fairy tales and myths have always worked more as armatures for our own imaginary wanderings rather than fully fleshed-out stories. So the film starts out at least half a step behind its own audience -- its too in love with the idea of Grimm standbys Hansel and Gretel growing up to be heavily armed badass witch slayers as if this is the first time anyone has thought of it. As a result the film fails to actually do anything with the idea except to keep highlighting how awesome it thinks it is. The movie opens with a slightly darker variation on the classic fairy tale with young Hansel and Gretel being captured by and eventually prevailing against a hideous witch who lures them with her candy house. But all thats prologue as narration by a grown-up Hansel (Jeremy Renner) reminds us. Now he and his sister (Gemma Arterton still stunning) roam the countryside dispensing justice against witches with an arsenal of anachronistically elaborate weapons. This time out they have to contend with a particularly powerful witch (Famke Janssen) who appears to have found a way that will allow her and her fellow witches to blend in among ordinary humans. For some reason this doesnt prevent Janssen one of our most underappreciated actresses from being uniquely wasted by the movie which makes her spend most of its running time hissing and shrieking and covered in garish makeup. The good news is that the actors appear to be having fun. The bad news is that were not. I may be the worlds only fan of Terry Gilliams The Brothers Grimm but that much-maligned film at least had the right idea It actually tried to build real characters (in its case the Grimms themselves) in order to play them off a cast of iconic fairy-tale figures in ironic situations. You would think Hansel amp; Gretel would have the good sense to try and turn its two lead characters into figures we could relate to -- seeing as how centuries of children have already done so. But the movie cant be bothered. Instead it plays out as a series of postures constantly repeating its central conceit -- framing our heroes in ostentatiously heroic poses ladling on the gore effects and the slow motion and the exploding bullets and state-of-the-art crossbows and whatnot. Its a lot of noise and whooshing camera effects and little else -- frantic yet lifeless. If the similarly situated Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter took itself too seriously the problem with Hansel amp; Gretel is that it doesnt quite take itself seriously enough -- which sounds insane but its not too much to ask that the movie go beyond its one and only joke. Instead amid all the fake Sturm und Drang all we hear is the movie giggling to itself.

"Review Hansel amp; Gretel lacks Grimm brothers creativity - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Hansel amp; Gretel lacks Grimm brothers creativityTommy Wirkolas update of Hansel amp; Gretel with Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as the all grown-up assassin siblings isnt nearly as clever as the original tale.January 25 2013|By Robert Abele Gemma Arterton is Gretel and Jeremy Renner is Hansel in ""Hansel amp;... (David Appleby )From a story once passed down in the oral tradition comes a version transmitted by repetitive audio-visual assault in ""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters.""The notorious folkloric tale about lost little siblings encountering the worst kind of sugar-coated bad news has been given a jokey R-rated once-over by Norwegian writer-director Tommy Wirkola whose calling card as a purveyor of wink wink splatter splatter entertainment was the 2009 undead Nazis romp ""Dead Snow.""Theres little to suggest however that shifting from zombies to witches has shaken his love of obliterating bodies by any means necessary.PHOTOS Movies of 2013""Hansel amp; Gretel"" is the latest attempt to graft action revisionism onto classic fairy tales A  la ""Snow White and the Huntsman."" The central premise is simple and crude but not without promise.Having grown up from their traumatic origins as near-victims of a cannibalistic witch bro (Jeremy Renner) and sis (Gemma Arterton) are now cover-model-ready mercenaries in tight leather ridding the countryside of cackling cracked-face nasties with an assortment of pump-action weaponry. Its therapy of a sort if you were say the NRAs Wayne LaPierre.But a recent spate of child kidnappings in the pairs wooded stomping grounds suggests a more devious-minded scheme in witchdom. Leading the villainy is grand witch Muriel who because shes played by angular beauty Famke Janssen gets at least a few scenes looking like a raven-haired avatar of gorgeous evil when not done up like rotted moldy plaster.Janssen can do more with an ugly mask however than an unvarnished Arterton who struggles to transform her porcelain blankness into believably tough expressions.Renner meanwhile making a run at holding the most franchises at one time (""Mission Impossible"" ""Bourne"" ""Avengers"") keeps up his credible mix of physicality and presence. But its hard to look at this stunt-heavy gig as little more than a workout video for future action star trainees.Its easy to chastise a piece of vigorous hack-work like ""Hansel amp; Gretel"" for its rote mayhem viscera fetishism and a surprisingly for a movie produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay a general witlessness.The anachronistic touches intended to push the movie into comedic areas a mostly to do with cursing a fall flat save for the surprise appearance of the 19th century version of a defibrillator which is weird enough to earn a giggle and the amusing notion that Hansel now needs insulin shots.But what galls is that for all the perspiration in jazzing up an old yarn theres not a whiff of originality in how Wirkola engages with the perverse pleasures enshrined by the Grimm brothers two of their eras shrewdest storytellers.Theres nothing half as clever here as the original storys moment of witch-vanquishing triumph or as creatively alluring as the idea of a gingerbread house or as eerily disturbing as the Grimms undertone of wishful matricide.Instead its the usual humans versus special effects anatomy-splitting rim shots and lame one-liners which baked together make for a familiarly sour confection indeed.---Hansel amp; Gretel Witch HuntersMPAA rating R for for strong fantasy horror violence and gore brief sexuality/nudity and languageRunning time 1 hour 28 minutesPlaying In general releasecalendarlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMGM reports strong quarter off Skyfall Hobbit successMarch 18 2013Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters leads slow box office...January 27 2013Hansel amp; Gretel will bewitch box office this weekendJanuary 24 2013Holiday gifts fit for a fairy taleDecember 11 2011Fairy tales with a twistApril 17 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-hansel-and-gretel-review-20130126,0,1310360.story",200,hanselandgretelwitchhunters11,hanselandgretelwitchhunters,latimes

Credit David Appleby/Paramount Pictures Between the vampire fad and the zombie fad we havent been giving nearly enough attention lately to this planets witch problem so its good to see the Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola put the issue back in the public eye with ""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters."" It may not stay in the public eye long because this movie is probably not going to put up ""Twilight""-like numbers but hey you have to admire the against-the-grain effort.Mr. Wirkola who also wrote the film takes as his starting point the somewhat perverse fairy tale about a brother and sister who are abandoned in the woods and then kidnapped by a witch who considers them dinner. Mr. Wirkola envisions the grown-up Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) who have amassed quite a reputation as witch hunters and are summoned to a village where children have been disappearing in alarming numbers.Candy cottage notwithstanding Mr. Wirkola doesnt sugarcoat his witches these are nasty creatures who desperately need some anti-wrinkle cream and are exceedingly difficult to kill. But Hansel and Gretel arent having nearly as much fun doing that job as brother-sister witch hunters ought to.There isnt much swashbuckling chemistry between Mr. Renner and Ms. Arterton and the script doesnt give them enough of the witty lines that can elevate these types of movies to must-see status which is odd since the producers include Will Ferrell. The most appealing character in the film ends up being a troll named Edward.""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for blood cursing and a skinny-dipping interlude.

Theres something vaguely satisfying about the impact and it throws up a few pretty sparks from time to time but theres nothing unexpected in the encounter between the two surfaces and the repetition gets dull. The grim heroes dont have a nuance or more than a hint of emotion between them and the same goes for the film around them. Plot developments are ladled out in such a perfunctory way its almost possible to hear the hammer shrug apathetically in mid-swing. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton play siblings Hansel and Gretel who as in the old fairy tale were abandoned in the woods as children encountered a candy house were captured by a witch who wanted to eat them and escaped by shoving her into her own fire. They grew up glowery leather-clad and laden down with fancy anachronistic guns which look odd amid a Middle Ages setting where the second-highest level of technology appears to be sticks stuck together with mud. When a group of witches starts kidnapping children Renner and Arterton are hired to hunt them down and return the kids which they essentially do by plodding to any point in the forest where a local points them and having a big battle that inevitably involves all of the combatants bouncing off or smashing through a few trees before picking themselves up to try again. Throughout the film the pattern repeats A character artlessly tosses out a bare minimum of exposition the leads troop to a new spot and a battle commences with a lot of hissing and gesticulating from the latest woman in crackle-faced monster makeup and an occasional extra going down in a quick explosion of gore. Renner and Arterton seem committed to their never-crack-a-smile roles where the closest thing to a witticism is ""Shut up already"" but the film isnt committed to them as people. Its particularly telling that Renners character in short order reveals a secret weakness that never comes to anything learns hes wrong about his blind prejudice against witches takes a lover (who from his awkwardness and judging by his driven lifestyle might well be his first) and--spoiler--watches her die all while barely changing expression. Nor does the film give him time to explore or ponder any of this. Meanwhile Arterton has her own barely executed shrug of a side plot involving a troll who befriends her Peter Stormare plays a villainous sheriff who doesnt last long enough to accomplish anything Thomas Mann shows up as a witch-hunter wannabe whom the film practically forgets and Famke Janssen purrs up a storm as the ""grand witch"" whos pretty much evil solely because somebody has to be. If the fights were exciting the special effects were exceptional the editing were tight and propulsive or there were any particular sense of build or momentum to any of this the lack of characterization or development might be excusable. And if it were risibly over-the-top it might at least be entertaining. But writer-director Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow) has instead produced a movie so blandly methodical and dedicated to hitting the required marks that it cant stop for thought or fun. It isnt a movie so much as a mechanical process. For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters Spoiler Space.

Watching Grimms fairy tale siblings who barely escaped a sugar-toting villain with a taste for child flesh makes more sense than seeing the 16th president chase bloodsuckers with an ax. The pairs vocation may be the only logical part of ""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters"" a rarely funny spoof thats heavy on bone-crushing and blood-gushing. The early scenes break down the familiar back story A brother and sister stumble upon a candy-coated cottage in the woods thats home to a witch who might be Freddy Kruegers great aunt. She tries to eat them but they kill her instead. And before you know it theyre all grown up (played by Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton) and bounty hunters. Brother and sister are hired by the mayor of a village with a problem. Children are disappearing at an alarming rate. Hansel and Gretel arrive as if two characters from ""The Matrix"" were dropped into 17th-century Heidelberg; they are leather-clad and carry massive guns and sassy attitudes that dont win them points with the wicked sheriff (Peter Stormare who is off to a bad start in 2013 also starring in the abominable ""The Last Stand""). The child-thieving culprits turn out to be a particularly formidable witch (Famke Janssen) and her two cronies including one who takes hair tips from ""Hellraiser."" Theres an explanation for all this -- something about a blood moon and a big sabbath feast featuring sacrifices and the hearts of white witches but does it really matter? Nearly all of the 80-some minutes focuses on fights or chases that culminate in some novel form of execution. Who knew there were so many ways to meet a violent end? Characters are eviscerated by wires or instantaneously dismembered with magic; a troll squashes a human head like a grape and a witch explodes a man using maggots. After a while its easy to become numb to the repulsive sights and bored by action that once seemed intense and exciting. For something presented as tongue-in-cheek ""Hansel amp; Gretel"" isnt nearly as funny as it should be. The humor comes across as less clever than writer-director Tommy Wirkola likely had in mind. In one scene Hansel injects himself in the leg with a syringe because all that candy as a child led to diabetes. Its mildly amusing but it also should have been a big red flag. Too much of anything whether its blood action or candy is never good.Contains excessively bloody violence nudity and crude language.

But its already starting to feel very once upon a time. The latest refurbished bit of folklore is Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters an intermittently fun but overexcited and predictable mish-mash that posits the two Grimm children as having grown up into a pair of leather-clad automatic crossbow-wielding witch-slaying siblings. The movie has been sitting on the shelf for a while and like say a house of candy you might find in the woods its gotten a bit stale. Jeremy Renner tries not to think about his two Oscar nominations as he grimaces and smirks his way through a by-the-storybook plot about his and his sisters (Gemma Arterton) efforts to thwart a grand witch (Famke Janssen) intent on stealing twelve children for an important black Sabbath sacrifice. Despite the fact that the film is produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay the tone is more cute than clever and willful anachronisms pop up all over the place like cell phones on the Titanic. Its pretty easy to tell early on where the plots trail of breadcrumbs is leading -- surprise Hansel and Gretels parents werent what they seemed -- but Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola keeps things moving with enough energy to gloss over the scripts laziness. Wirkola who helmed the Nazis-on-ice horror comedy Dead Snow is also fond of cartoonish gore witches are drawn and quartered and sliced into chunks and a number of heads explode wetly like overripe tomatoes. This is presumably meant to take advantage of the films 3-D although the extra dimension is filled with so much splintered timber fractured crossbeams and flying branches that it feels like someone has pointed the angry end of a woodchipper at your face for most of the movie. Psychologist and fairy-tale analyst Bruno Bettelheim once ran the original Hansel and Gretel story through the Freud-o-tron and concluded it was intended to aid children in overcoming their oral fixations. Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters has learned no such lesson in restraint indulging fully in its own childish fixations on brainless action and mindless violence. While this might give you an initial sugar rush eventually youll be stuffed so full you cant help but get a stomachache. C?

I say screw the damn thing and run the other way. Its all kinds of sad to see the gifted Jeremy Renner (Hurt Locker The Town) tainting his rep for the sake of a quick payday. Renner plays the grownup Hansel. The British actress Gemma Arterton takes on Gretel his sister. And theyre both in the - wait for it - witch hunting business. Thats a cue for Norwegian writer-director Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow) to explode heads and toss stuff at us in 3D. Hansels candy fetish has made him the first recorded diabetic of the Middle Ages. He carries an old-school hypodermic needle. Thems the jokes folks. Hansel does have a keen eye for business. ""Trolls are extra"" he tells the sheriff (Peter Stormare).

Exhibit A Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Huners ((c)Paramount/Courtesy Everett Col) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday January 25 2013 1141 AM Title Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters Film Info With Jeremy Renner Gemma Arterton. A classic fairytale gets an action update. Director Tommy Wirkola (128). R Bloody violence nudity language. Area theaters. Actors often claim that they appreciate fame because it allows them the freedom to choose better roles or get higher-caliber movies made. As someone who built his early career in challenging independent films Jeremy Renner seems like the sort of guy whod take that worthy approach. And yet the more successful he gets the further away from interesting work he moves. In 2002 he astounded a small number of viewers as the serial killer lead in the little-seen ""Dahmer."" In 2005 he impressed the likes of Kathryn Bigelow as a white supremacist in ""Neo Ned."" In 2010 he earned a well-deserved Oscar nomination for fiercely grounding Bigelows ""Hurt Locker."" And in 2013 hes in ""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters."" What happened? When did this intensely gifted actor turn into a guy who sleepwalks his way through ""Mission Impossible--or gets overshadowed by almost every other hero in ""The Avengers""? And those movies at least were quality popcorn. This disposable effort is as stale as it gets. In fairness Renner seems more engaged here than he did in ""Ghost Protocol"" or even ""The Bourne Legacy."" In fact he appears to be having fun a response we rarely see from him. Last we all heard from Hansel and Gretel they were outwitting a witch of Grimm nightmares. Director/co-writer Tommy Wirkola fast forwards several years when the siblings (Renner and Gemma Arterton) have become--well see the title. Renner (sitting center) with his on screen sister Gemma Arterton ((c)Paramount/Courtesy Everett Col) After several children are kidnapped they discover that a coven led by Muriel (Famke Janssen) has been taking them. Their journey into her forest suggests she needs Gretel too for a plan to make herself and her fellow witches invincible. There are some funny lines and several cool battle scenes between the hunters and their black-magic prey. But even in 3D the effects fall flat as often as they impress with little attention paid to important details. Surely the most iconic image in the film should be the witchs candy house and yet its muddled design is so unappealing no kid would be fooled into eating it. More significantly Wirkolas anachronistic style-in which 19th century Germans wield steampunk bazookas and say things like ""You gotta be f----ing kidding me""-isnt clever enough to support itself. It doesnt help either that much of the cast seems tentative about this approach do they take a high road or a low one? Arterton and Janssen appear especially uncertain and never quite settle on the right tone. Derek Mears unrecognizable as a giant troll stands out by infusing the film with a solemn vulnerability. But even if hes slumming Renner gets it best his dry delivery fully acknowledges the movies ridiculousness. If youre planning on entering this fractured fairy tale youll want to follow his lead.

""Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters"" is not a good film -- its inconsistently acted and somehow both underwritten and overplotted -- but it has some good things going for it. For one its not outrageously dumber than its revisionist folklore-themed predecessors ""Van Helsing"" ""Red Riding Hood"" or TVs ""Once Upon a Time"" and its far more goofily violent. It also boasts a nice title credit sequence and a brisk running time. But most importantly the long-shelved pic is set to bow with little serious B.O. competition ensuring suitable time for crumb gathering before its consigned to obscurity. To his credit ""Hansel amp; Gretel"" writer-director Tommy Wirkola never takes the pics premise -- the titular Grimm siblings grow into wisecracking primitive-machine-gun-packing bounty hunters thanks to that fateful spell in the gingerbread house -- too seriously. Yet while the film rarely provokes any strenuous eye-rolling it also cant drum up even the slightest interest in the fate of its characters let alone suspense. Cursing with anachronistic brio and decked out in Steampunkish frock coats and leather pants Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton star as the sibling slayers who have parlayed their childhood fame into a thriving witch-hunting business. Called upon to investigate disappearing children in a woodland village the two run afoul of the local sheriff (Peter Stormare) when they interrupt a witch hunt in progress. The woman in question (Pihla Viitala) turns out to be a ""white witch"" with a thing for Hansel (her pretense for skinny-dipping makes Princes Lake Minnetonka line seem like the height of subtle seduction) while Gretel is stalked by a sort of medieval fanboy (Thomas Mann) who tirelessly follows her exploits in newspapers. Meanwhile a particularly vindictive witch (Famke Janssen) from the surrounding forest redoubles her efforts to terrorize the townsfolk. Wirkola introduces some moderately clever touches here and there; the missing-children posters strapped to medieval milk bottles are worth a laugh and making Hansel a diabetic thanks to his childhood sugar trauma is a smart idea that the film unceremoniously abandons. But these are few and far between. A film with a concept this strange has no right to be so dully formulaic yet after 15 minutes the script has entirely exhausted its sparks of real invention. The action is frequent and competently staged. All the same a distressing feeling of sameness takes over midway through and viewers may be surprised to find themselves yawning as yet another witch is ripped apart limb from limb sending yet another wave of viscera sluicing toward the camera. On that note the pic isnt helped by Renners apparent disdain for the material; his Hansel may be a bit of a jaded ruffian but the weary groan he seems to keep stifling has nothing to do with the character as written. Janssen is likewise unconvincing meaning that Arterton registers as the films standout thesp simply by being its most willing participant spunkily bouncing up after numerous beatings (of which she is far more likely to be the recipient than her sibling curiously) and sparring semi-cutely with Mann. While visual effects and production design are solid ""Hansel and Gretels"" 3D work is surprisingly shoddy and distracting for reasons both creative (the frequency of protrusive blades and flying debris) and technical (a fuzzy gray sheen that appears during the films numerous night scenes). Germanys Studio Babelsberg lot provides some attractively picturesque village grime.

Daily Edition Login to download Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters Film Review 1258 AM PST 1/25/2013 by Stephen Farber FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Jokey anachronisms and 3D monsters abound in this cheesy fantasy. TWITTER Campy violent version of Grimms fairy tale should entice fanboys. Grimms fairy tales have captivated TV viewers lately and an equally large audience probably will lap up the campy 3D extravaganza Hansel amp; Gretel Witch Hunters when it opens in theaters this weekend. The picture was shot two years ago but Paramount might have found the right moment to release it -- in the dog days of January when competition is thin. Young fanboys will sneak into the movie despite the R rating but there isnt much here to entice anyone with a bit of maturity. Oscar nominee Jeremy Renner seems out of place in this tacky pastiche but hopefully the fat paycheck he received will allow him to return to artier fare very soon. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of THRs Jeremy Renner Cover Shoot When you see the names of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay among the films producers you know that Hansel amp; Gretel never was intended to be taken seriously. Lots of anachronisms and tongue-in-cheek dialogue establish the spoofy nature of this violent venture. All thats missing is a genuine sense of wit. The film begins by referring to the original fairy tale when a young Hansel and Gretel are abandoned in the forest and venture into a witchs cottage built of delicious candy. (Theres a good joke later when the adult Hansel takes a medieval version of an insulin injection to help him counteract that sugar addiction.) Then the movie jumps forward a couple of decades to find the grown-up Hansel (Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) turning their childhood trauma into a vocation. The time period is a bit indistinct. Some of the production details evoke the Middle Ages yet our heroes have an arsenal of somewhat more modern weaponry to help them annihilate witches and warlocks. As they stalk their prey brother and sister find allies -- a ""white witch"" for Hansel and a troll who takes a fancy to Gretel -- but basically they have to rely on their own grit to triumph over their enemies. Their chief antagonist is a cunning vixen who morphs from glamorous to hideous when the mood strikes. This must be the year for screen beauties to indulge their ugly side. Famke Janssen follows Julia Roberts and Charlize Theron in releasing her hidden monster. STORY Box Office Preview Hansel and Gretel Set to Slay Star-Studded Movie 43 Parker Despite its few wry jokes the script is awfully thin. Norwegian writer-director Tommy Wirkola (Dead Snow) loves to film crushed and exploding heads but the film is too fanciful to be truly revolting. Wirkola makes the most of the 3D technology; there havent been as many deadly weapons flying at the audience since the era of It Came From Outer Space. Unfortunately the director doesnt bring much out of the actors. Renner and Arterton are certainly game but this foolish vehicle doesnt give them a chance to show what they do best. With a running time of less than 90 minutes the film is smart enough not to wear out its welcome. But thats the only sign of true intelligence in this juvenile caper.

Photo David Appleby Gemma Arterton and Jeremy Renner cant do anything to save the ghastly ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters."" (David Appleby) Im Really quite a fan of your work a young man tells the brother-and-sister protagonists of the dismal ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters. Its a sentiment unlikely to be shared by audience members -- especially if theyre unlucky enough to shell out 20 bucks to watch this direct-to-video-grade dreck in murky IMAX 3-D. January is a traditional dumping ground for Hollywood studio mistakes and this ones a real stinker thats been mouldering on the shelf at Paramount after a planned opening last March was postponed. When a flicks been whittled down to just 80 minutes before the end credits its a sure sign of a dump job designed to suck up as many dollars as possible before lethal word-of-mouth spreads. Co-produced by Will Ferrell this is an exceedingly dull and stillborn attempt to update the Brothers Grimm. In this misguided sequel the grown-up Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (lovely Gemma Arterton) have gone into the witch-hunting business after shoving one into an oven as kids. Armed with anachronistic machine guns grenades and tasers the brother and sister turn up in the Bavarian village of Ausburg where the locals are about to burn a redhead they believe is a witch responsible for the disappearance of a number of children. Much to the annoyance of the sheriff (Peter Stormare) they set the redhead free and set out to capture the actual culprit the Great Witch (Famke Janssen) before she can convene a witch convention. Or something like that. All sort of generic fantasy tropes and cheesy special effects are boringly trundled out by Norwegian director Tommy Wirkola (""Dead Snow) whose screenplay could probably fit on a napkin. Nothing makes a whole lot of sense in this incoherent movie whose directors philosophy seems to be When in doubt cut somebodys head off. Janssen who wears some ghastly makeup is on record as saying she did ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters to pay off her mortgage. I wonder what excuse Renner an Oscar nominee for ""The Hurt Locker and ""The Town could possibly offer for his third thankless (if highly remunerative) role in a row -- following ""Marvels the Avengers and ""The Bourne Legacy. Renner looks vaguely embarrassed throughout particularly when hes required to give himself an injection of 18th-century insulin because of his childhood indulgence in a candy-covered house. When the Great Witchs trail leads them back to that same house for the mindlessly anti-climactic climax of ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters Hansel quips ""Youve gotta be f-king kidding me. My sentiments exactly.
