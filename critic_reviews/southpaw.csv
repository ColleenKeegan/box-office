Credit Scott Garfield/The Weinstein Company/ Everett The boxing drama ""Southpaw"" has the chilling feel of a movie made to fit the requirements of a dictatorship--not a political one but rather a bureaucratic one. The creations of the director Antoine Fuqua and the screenwriter Kurt Sutter seem to have been freeze-dried cut into card-sized tiles and laid out sequentially--sustaining only the shallowest definition of character connected only by the thinnest string of motive and hermetically isolated from the practicalities among which the action ostensibly takes place. The story is a pastiche of classic Hollywood boxing dramas. Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) who grew up in a Hells Kitchen orphanage is the undefeated light-heavyweight champion but he brings a bitter art to the sweet science his method is to absorb a vast amount of punishment from his opponent until seized with rage he fights back with an irresistibly violent fury. After one bout his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams)--his lifelong love raised in the same orphanage--tells him that hes absorbing too much punishment. Shes the brains of the operation and when his manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent) brings in a contract for a three-fight deal she opposes it. These early expositional sequences are among the movies few attractions; they hint at the behind-the-scenes dramas of the sport involving media executives middlemen family doctors and the many other interested parties depending on the agonies in the ring. Unfortunately they flit by quickly with no more development than anything else in the movie. Instead Billy gets into a scuffle with a potential challenger in a hotel ballroom a gun is fired Maureen is killed and Billy is left to raise their young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) alone. Possessed by grief and anger he quickly loses his championship as well as his license to box destroys his reputation loses his money and loses custody of Leila who becomes a ward of the state. In order to regain custody Billy needs to put himself and his career back together. To do so he turns to the trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) a former fighter who now runs a rumpled street-side gym thats also a second home to troubled boys from the neighborhood. Its no spoiler to say that the movies other virtue is found--briefly--in these later scenes when Tick retrains Billy and teaches him skills that the dethroned champion lacks. For all the storys classic elements its core throwback is to the sense of oversupervised overproduction the sort of rigid controls seen in studio filmmaking from the nineteen-thirties. But back then that control was exercised by producers who in many cases were creators in their own right people whose business sense arose from their story sense--which arose in turn from an authentic popular touch a fundamental intuition for the great average for the big emotional targets in their customers hearts. Their sense for that sweet spot elevated the work of the industrys vast run of skilled professionals and frustrated its handful of original artists who chafed under studio control and thrived in a later day of independent production. The producers of ""Southpaw"" havent created a film of people for people; theyve populated the movie with humanoids mere semblances of people who are endowed with the imitation of life by the thankless exertions of the extraordinary actors who embody them--and whose faces and voices might as well be applied digitally. The modicum of pleasure delivered by ""Southpaw"" arrives thanks to its cast who struggle bravely and energetically with the hopelessly bland text and the invisible impersonal direction. Gyllenhaal slurs and shambles steams and rampages swirling with generic energy that in the absence of cues from the script he seems to have wrenched from the depths of his training. Whitaker is one of the best actors of his generation who would be as they say fascinating to hear reading a phone book (would that there had been one on the set); McAdams seems to have been directed not to play Maureen but to play Margot Robbie playing Naomi Lapaglia playing Maureen a stereotype of a stereotype; and 50 Cent is a majestic nonactor whose straightforward talk lends substance to his sadly minor role. Even the earnest young Laurence must contend with such monologues as ""I miss you a lot Mom. More than ever."" These actors do more than carry the film; they distract from it. In this context-free context their able and thoughtful efforts seem less like performances than like stunts; the frenetic and spectacular display of actorly work conveys such detached virtuosity that it undercuts from the start the very human touch that it signifies and for which it substitutes. I recently described ""Terminator Genisys"" as a ""simulacrum of a movie""; the same applies here and there may be a connection between the two in the creation of movies for an international market. Thats not a new phenomenon but its a recent one and it accounts in part for the plethora of superhero movies and comic-book-based movies that studios produce--stories that dont depend on a sense of place on characters bearing particular local traits or for that matter on characters who bear much resemblance to people anywhere. But because such movies are largely about the technological transformation of humans the process and the subtext fold back into the subject and become both reflexive and symbolic. Even ""Terminator Genisys"" as mediocre as it is felt like a movie about the very experience of its viewing. ""Southpaw"" is different. Its exactly what certain critics yearn for a midrange drama for adults. Its a midrange drama made in a movie economy that has trouble sustaining the format; its a delocalized international-style midrange drama and as such its a contradiction in terms. There is almost no process in the film as if displaying the detailed workings of courts and businesses of transactions and interrogations threatened to reveal state secrets; theres no depth of character in the film as if the wild vectors of the inner life the diverse impulses and loose ends of which a personality is made might undermine the plots robotic inevitability. It feels like a post-apocalyptic version of entertainment a throwback--not to 1934 but to ""1984.""

"Southpaw | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; southpaw ) Southpaw (United States 2015) July 25 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Boxing movies are like romantic comedies they come in neat packages follow tried-and-true formulas and rarely challenge conventions.  There are outliers of course like Martin Scorseses brilliant Raging Bull but those are rare. For the most part the boxing movie falls into one of two categories Rocky or its sequels. Southpaw is a member of the class of recent productions that gravitates toward the latter stories more about humanity and relationships than winning or losing. In Rocky it was less about beating Apollo Creed than showing grit earning respect and getting the girl. Fundamentally Southpaw isnt much different. To the extent that most boxing movies are about redemption Southpaw isnt an exception. When the broad strokes are considered it follows the expected trajectory. The movies strengths crystallize from nuance and performances. We care more about Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) the man than Billy Hope the boxer although the two are inextricably entwined. The salient dynamic isnt Billy vs. the arrogant opponent or Billy vs. the world; its Billy vs. himself. And the ""girl"" he pursues isnt a romantic interest its his 10-year old daughter. Southpaw isnt content with presenting a gallery of cliched characters. It takes the time to put flesh on the bones. Viewed from a high-level perspective theyre familiar the down-on his luck pugilist the grizzled trainer the caring wife. But the script makes them real and the actors invest in their portrayals. I wont pretend there isnt a surfeit of testosterone. Director Antoine Fuqua imbues the matches with sufficient intensity for us to have a rooting interest. In the end however were conscious that the real struggles occur outside of the ring and what happens in the inevitable Big Event is of secondary importance. Billy ""The Great"" Hope is the undefeated middleweight champion. But with age creeping up on him hes showing vulnerability. He gets hit more often and in his latest fight it takes a knockout for him to win. His manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent) isnt worried - he sees only  and intends to bleed Billy under the guise of friendship until theres nothing left. His wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) feels differently. She wants Billy to take some time off to heal and be a father to his devoted daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Circumstances and self-destructive impulses force him into an untenable situation that leave him destitute and abandoned.  He seeks the help and advice of a new trainer Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) whose tough-love approach offers him an opportunity to regain his self-respect and more importantly win back the trust of one little girl. If Southpaw had been released in November it might have garnered three acting Oscar nominations. Those performances elevate material thats already serious and thoughtful. The Academy has a short memory however so the July opening makes it questionable whether anyone will remember these players when it comes time to hand out end-of-the-year plaudits. Following Nightcrawler with another amazing physical transformation Gyllenhaal commits to inhabiting Billy. Forest Whitaker who has recently accepted a large number of unchallenging roles provides an intensity we havent seen since his Oscar-winning portrayal in The Last King of Scotland. And for Oona Laurence this is as commanding a breakthrough performance as we have seen from a young actress since Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit. Southpaw features the final score composed by James Horner. Its also one of his best - accentuating moments and emotions without dominating scenes. Its low-key and effective and sounds nothing like his previous compositions. Because Fuqua was working on a limited budget Horner contributed without pay. The movie is dedicated to his memory. If youre looking for surprises and twists Southpaw offers few. Its strength lies not in the cleverness of its narrative but in the depth of its characters - well-crafted believable individuals who make the predicable story seem more unique and compelling than it might otherwise be. In a way this is a bait-and-switch because although the marketing campaign leads us to believe this is just another boxing movie the father/daughter relationship underpins every frame. Fuqua has crafted something unusual in this day of cookie-cutter blockbusters and overwrought dramas a serious sincere summer motion picture.

Director Antoine Fuqua gets you to lower your guard with a solemn deep-toned prologue in which Rachel McAdams as Maureen the wife of boxer Billy Hope (really) kneels before her mute husband and tenderly wraps his hands with gauze. Something sacred passes between them Billy grew up in cruddy state facilities where he met Maureen when she was 12. Shes not just smoking hot. She holds his fragile soul in her hands. Then Billy -- the light-heavyweight champion of the world -- goes into the ring and barely defends himself taking punch after punch on the way to victory blood pooling in his left eye and mixing with saliva that falls in strings from his mouth. Maureen knows he cant endure much more without becoming ""punch drunk"" brain-damaged. But Billy has an entourage (among them a steely eyed manager played by 50 Cent who portrays himself as ""family"") a taunting adversary named Escobar (Miguel Gomez) and an opulent lifestyle to maintain. And then with cruel suddenness Maureen is no longer there and the long downward spiral begins. It starts horrifically and gets worse until Billys precious 12-year-old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) is ripped from his arms and he cries out in agony like a mortally wounded animal. It would be easy to giggle at SouthpawA -- its belly-to-belly cliches and absurd pileup of misfortunes -- if Fuquas pummeling werent so adroit (from the French droit suggesting right-handed fluency as opposed to the gaucherie of the un-calculating southpaw boxer). Fuqua is slick Ill give him that. You know from The Equalizer that hell do anything however unconscionable to ratchet up the stakes (the murder of a prostitute was especially gratuitous) and Southpaw is the pinnacle of a certain kind of macho sadomasochism. Beside it Ron Howards Cinderella Man is nuanced Martin Scorseses Raging Bull restrained. When little bespectacled Leila is dragged off by the courts bound for the kind of parentless defenseless existence that Billy -- with the help of Maureen -- fought his way out of you think Fuqua has hit a new low. But then he introduces another defenseless kid Hoppy (Skylan Brooks) who has martyred bunny rabbit imprinted on his face. The punishment the movie doles out is unceasing. 50 Cent has the straight-ahead credibility of a businessman; he doesnt editorialize. And Forest Whitaker -- as Tick Wills the owner of a gym who seeks to protect kids and who takes on the wounded Billy teaching him balance -- is incapable of banality suggesting Willis is himself a doomed soul. But its Gyllenhaal who dominates Southpaw. He has built himself up in a way thats not just staggering but expressive. He has big hurting muscles -- combined with his sad-mask-of-tragedy face they seem to be crying for help. His slowness of manner and slurry diction suggest he was arrested at an early stage of development not just emotionally but in a Darwinian sense. His Billy doesnt have the tools to respond to tragedy and Gyllenhaal makes you believe that he as well as the character is out of control. Its the kind of performance that makes other actors say ""Wow He made a strong choice and committed to it"" I veered between being awed and appalled though mostly the latter. The trouble with Gyllenhaal is that he shows little range not from role to role but within roles. He played one emotion (to acclaim) in Nightcrawler and plays one (to equal or greater acclaim) here. The only thing surprising is how far he takes what he does without varying his tone. Although Billy Hope is supposed to learn defense and self-possession Gyllenhaal never shows how this knowledge transforms him. Its a brilliant dull performance.

Wait what did I just say? You didnt know ""Southpaw"" was an alternate-universe story did you? Well Im not sure the people who made it know that either or at least they might not put it quite that way. This marks the first Hollywood screenplay for Kurt Sutter creator of the biker-gang series ""Sons of Anarchy"" another heightened macho melodrama that shouldnt necessarily be taken as realistic. Both of Sutters guy-centric fantasy worlds pose approximately the same problem Is this a redemptive vision of human possibility or just an exercise in mendacious masculine ego-stroking?On a moral level Im pretty sure the answer is ""some of both"" or ""it depends"" which is frustrating. If we move to the technical level ""Southpaw"" is a tremendous accomplishment of mainstream cinematic craft a near-perfect match of director material and star. Even amid the abundant ridiculousness of ""Sons of Anarchy"" Sutters storytelling skill was always evident and despite the narrative obviousness of ""Southpaw"" I was pretty much on the edge of my seat from beginning to end. For Fuqua who has been kicking around the action-adventure fringes of Hollywood since his breakout with ""Training Day"" in 2001 this movie feels like the fulfillment of his enormous potential the cornball pulp demi-masterpiece hes been threatening to make all along. (Im more than happy to defend ""The Equalizer"" Fuquas surprise hit from last summer. We can discuss ""Olympus Has Fallen"" and ""Shooter"" some other time.)Ive described Fuqua before as a younger African-American cognate to Martin Scorsese and I dont mean that as a dismissal or a joke. Both directors display enormous technical talent and profound passion for cinema and both have built their careers on long-term collaborations with first-rate cinematographers Scorsese with Michael Ballhaus and Robert Richardson Fuqua with Mauro Fiore. Both are also given to pursuing grandiose fables of agonized American manhood and sometimes find themselves fighting uphill battles against mediocre material. If its also obvious that one of them has had a much more illustrious career and achieved far more power and independence than the other lets just say that many factors are involved in that. We dont have to argue that Fuqua is as good as Scorsese to see that his career has been impeded by Hollywoods deeply ingrained racial attitudes.""Southpaw"" will probably be more popular with audiences than with critics perhaps because its so deliberately and conspicuously old-fashioned. Despite its apparent mode of gritty 21st-century realism - which includes some of the most brutal and convincing simulated fight scenes in Hollywood history -- at heart this is a boxing flick drawn from the way-back era before ""Raging Bull"" and even before ""Rocky."" With a few superficial details adjusted ""Southpaws"" mythic tale of fall and redemption could be set in 1965 or 1935.But those superficial details are important including the fact that this is a movie about a white fighter in an overwhelmingly black and Latino sport made by a black director and a white writer. No one in ""Southpaw"" ever directly mentions the race of riches-to-rags light-heavyweight champ Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) either as a cultural anomaly or a marketing bonanza although it is clearly both. But even Billys surname is an unsubtle reference to the ancient racist boxing trope of the Great White Hope the wholesome and immensely marketable American hero who will rescue the sport from irredeemable blackness. The cultural history of the Great White Hope goes clear back to Jack Johnsons fights against white challengers Jim Jeffries and Jess Willard more than a century ago. But as Sutter and Fuqua are both old enough to remember it endured into the 1980s when it poisoned the career of heavyweight contender Gerry Cooney a decent man who never wanted to carry that racial baggage. You Might Also Like When I say that ""Southpaw"" takes place in an alternate version of American reality I dont just mean that its hero is a hard-scrabble white ethnic kid who was raised in an orphanage in Hells Kitchen on the western edge of midtown Manhattan. That romantic Palookaville scenario grows less plausible by the second The last pockets of working-class whites departed Hells Kitchen in the Giuliani era and the neighborhood has been entirely colonized by fashionable gay couples and hard-partying financial-sector dudes. But if we assume that Billy was born there in the mid-80s and mix in a little suspension of disbelief then sure its possible.Sutters fictional universe is imaginary on a more basic level even beyond its pre-gentrified ""Dark Knight""-style portrayal of New York City. ""Southpaw"" presents boxing as a huge headline-dominating enterprise in 2015 - roughly the way it was three or four decades ago - instead of a disreputable cultural sideshow associated with widespread corruption criminal misbehavior and permanent brain damage. (How many Americans could name a heavyweight champion more recent than Mike Tyson?) Within that fiction Sutter builds an if/then parable If boxing were still that big then we might get a white champion from a storybook background whose race was not seen as important and who might be brought down by an unscrupulous black promoter (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in an impressive array of vintage Americana suits) and then rescued and rebuilt by a hardass black trainer (the always watchable Forest Whitaker).Its tempting to leap to the conclusion that ""Southpaw"" was constructed to appeal to the half-conscious desires or prejudices of white audiences to the hopeful or naive idea that race does not matter or should not matter or at least might not matter if we worked at it hard enough. But I think its overly reductive to assume that only white people are vulnerable to such a vision (which was articulated more clearly by Martin Luther King Jr. than by any other American) and anyway thats writing Fuqua out of the picture way too much. Like any Hollywood director below the top tier Fuqua is a collaborator in an elaborate bureaucratic enterprise rather than an auteur but most of his films (and all the good ones) have been ambiguous fables of black-white conflict and cooperation in which an environment of apparent racial blindness and racial equality masks a deeper and more anguished reality. If that is captured most vividly by the famous scene in ""Training Day"" where Denzel Washington convinces Ethan Hawke to smoke crack (partly by addressing him with the N-word) similar moments of tension recur in almost every Fuqua movie - sometimes by omission as in ""The Equalizer"" where the race of Washingtons superhuman avenger (a character originally written as white) is never mentioned. After punch-drunk Billy Hope has lost his wife (a brief but striking part for Rachel McAdams) his championship his daughter his grandiose suburban manse and all his cars and money and bling he finds himself in a bar with Tick Wills the grouchy ursine boxing lifer played by Whitaker in the middle of a Bronx neighborhood where (if this were reality) Billy would pretty much be the only white person under age 90. ""What happened to your eye?"" Billy asks midway through their scene of monosyllabic male bonding. Tick smiles in a way that might be mischievous or might be something else and whispers ""Blue-eyed devil took my eye.""That scene struck me as closer to the secret heart of ""Southpaw"" than all the exciting fight footage or the boilerplate story of Billys relationship with the unctuous promoter Jordan Mains (50 Cent) and his cocksure trash-talking and possibly more talented nemesis Miguel ""Magic"" Escobar (Miguel Gomez). If this movie connects with audiences of course it does so first and foremost as a visual and visceral spectacle an old-school inspirational yarn about a damaged violent man struggling to outgrow his self-destructive anger. But as is almost always true with the best American genre films below that obvious level much of its power comes from a subtler darker place. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Entertainment The Most Disturbing Thing About ""Southpaw"" Isnt How Much Jake Gyllenhaal Bleeds Gyllenhaal has beefed up impressively for the boxing movie but gets shown up by a little girl. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jake Gyllenhaal in Southpaw. Weinstein Company ID 6355564 Like Rocky Balboa and Homer Simpson Billy Hope the boxer played by Jake Gyllenhaal in the well-acted undercooked Southpaw is the kind of guy who can take a lot of punishment. He thrives on it. Commentators joke that hes unfamiliar with the concept of defense during the movies opening scenes in which we catch up with Billy mid-fight. Getting hit makes him angry and you wouldnt like him when hes angry. In the shot right before the title treatment appears the best one in the movie he advances slow-motion into focus and at the camera blood in his mouth and running down his face -- a man drawing power from the pummeling hes just taken. Billys wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) tells him hell be brain damaged in two years at the rate hes going a fact he acknowledges but doesnt want to think about. There are a lot of things Billy prefers not to think about like the money he freely spends on a massive house and lavish gifts for his friends or the things that his slick manager Jordan Mains (50 Cent) may have done on behalf of his career. Thinking does not seem to be Billys strong suit in general as we see from the way he sweetly incoherently mutters his way through a charity-event speech for the organization that helped him as an orphaned kid. Hes a physical creature and Gyllenhaal plays him like a boy in the body of a beast rippling muscle and a diminished affect outside of the ring where he comes back to himself and assesses the damage. He seems to spend the entire movie recovering from an eye injury only to immediately get another one in the big fight that takes up the last act. When Billy makes his way to a bare-bones gym run by Forest Whitaker for training the movie almost makes a joke of the pairs shared ocular asymmetry. ID 6346075 View this image > The Weinstein Company ID 6355666 Theres nothing exceptional about the fact that Southpaw which was directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day The Equalizer) and written by Sons of Anarchys Kurt Sutter is a violent movie. Its a movie about boxing which in addition to looking great onscreen also basically consists of repeated acts of violence. But it struggles to make its violence count for anything. When you look past Fuquas jittery directing which dices up shots and leans the camera close into its stars painstakingly battered mug Southpaw is a melange of familiar fighter movie ideas and images going back to Rocky. Its about a champ whos come from nothing and whos returned to nothing by tragedy -- a fallen hero looking for redemption. Gyllenhaals performance is solid and his physical transformation from underfed Nightcrawler scavenger to bulging brawler is both impressive and awards bait-y. But the most provocative thing Southpaw has going for it is the way it has to juice its comeback story with child endangerment. It establishes a main character so rooted in physical toughness and a willingness to walk into punches until hes dead that it actually needs additional stakes to make his survival worth investing in. Left to his own devices Billy cant be trusted to keep himself alive. The only way that Southpaw can introduce tension is through Leila (Oona Laurence) Billys bespectacled solemn-faced little girl who waits up for him and tallies his bruises after fights. Leila ends up in the care of child services for a while courtesy of legitimate neglect on the part of her anguished father -- whos so in the grip of his own emotions he cant think about being a parent. She has to be earned back through very unchamp-like activities like securing a job and going to anger management classes things that are mostly left offscreen in favor of training sequences. And most uncomfortably Leila is there watching as her dad gets back into the game to face the films bad guy for whats established will be a bloody battle. Southpaw leverages the adorable Laurence with a calculation thats more brutal than anything it depicts in the ring using her as bait to get its main character to man up while also channeling its more violent moments through her eyes to give them added resonance. Its an affirmation of family thats largely indifferent to its own contradictions about whats best for the kid it uses for emotional heft.

What youve probably heard less of is just how formulaic the movie swirling around his ripped abs and inked torso is. Film acting is a slippery art to discuss. When its done well it involves nuance and the subtle sublimation of self--most of which is imperceptible and utterly mysterious. Its why we mistake drastic weight fluctuations and Method stunts for a great performance. Gyllenhaals Southpaw performance is great but for reasons unrelated to his physique. Hes thrilling to watch and the only unpredictable thing in a two-hours-plus movie where you can count on one hand the number of moments that arent hand-me-downs from better boxing films like Rocky Raging Bull and Fat City. The movies title refers to a fighter who uses his left fist as his agent of destruction. Since most lead with their right an uppercut from the south side can pack a devastating surprise wallop. Gyllenhaals light-heavyweight champion Billy Hope (an unfortunately on-the-nose name) isnt a natural southpaw but its the stealth weapon hell unleash as his rags-to-riches-to-rags saga reaches its inevitable riches-again finale. At the beginning of the film we see Billys hands being wrapped before the fight that will earn him the championship belt while his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) whos been by his side since they were kids in a Hells Kitchen foster home gives him a steely pep talk. The good times wont last. After a tragedy sparked by a showboating rival (Miguel Gomez) Billy loses everything Maureen his daughter (Oona Laurence) his fortune and his will to live. Yes Southpaw is a redemption story that hoariest of feel-good subgenres. But Gyllenhaal manages to give Billy a raw inner fire thats more impressive than anything the actors achieved with his personal trainer. Coming off a string of dazzling career-redefining roles in films like last years Nightcrawler Gyllenhaal turns Billys pain into an inarticulate rage. You get the sense that the ring is a place where he finds peace through oblivion. At his lowest point Billy humbles himself and asks the owner of a skid-row gym (Forest Whitaker) for help getting back on top and gets the sort of gruff life lessons ripped from the Burgess Meredith playbook. Gyllenhaal and Whitakers wary friendship is the films high point. But just as director Antoine Fuqua starts to close in on something interesting and unexpected he retreats to the safety of his corner and gives us what weve seen too many times before a predictable flurry of melodramatic jabs when what he really needed to throw at us was a haymaker we couldnt see coming--the knockout punch of a southpaw.

When hes not raging in the ring Billy is tender and loving with his pragmatic and beautiful wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and young daughter Leila (Oona Lawrence).Billys on top of the world handing Rolexes out to his posse and living the big mansion life until Maureen is killed by a wayward gunshot. Then Billy loses his will to fight. When a fight promoter (50 Cent) convinces him to get back in the ring he gets pummeled and loses the championship. This touches off a deep downward swirl.When its over Billy has lost nearly everything including his home and a resentful Leila is being held by child protective services. Billy has to rebuild his life. He turns to a strict demanding trainer (Forest Whitaker) who runs a low-level gym and starts rehabilitating himself. He wants his daughter and his championship back.""Southpaw"" is hardly a subtle movie but then it doesnt want to be one. Writer Kurt Sutter the creator of ""Sons of Anarchy"" knows hes working along classic lines and he embraces them while giving his characters more color than most. The booming rap soundtrack from Eminems Shady Records is all storm and fury while director Antoine Fuquas slick style effectively travels from outright violence to sentiment although he does succumb to an overly cliched training montage toward the end.Still its Gyllenhaal -- physically ferocious yet tenderly forlorn -- who sells the movie putting both the beast and the heartbeat within on full display.TLongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongSouthpawGRADE BRated R for language throughout and some violenceRunning time 123 minutes 183 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1RXz0i7 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/07/24/movie-review-southpaw/30611677/,200,southpaw6,southpaw,detroitnews
"Put a Ring on It Jake Gyllenhaal Fights for Love in Southpaw While Adam Sandler Fights Donkey Kong in Pixels << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Put a Ring on It Jake Gyllenhaal Fights for Love in Southpaw While Adam Sandler Fights Donkey Kong in Pixels The Weinstein Company Movies July 24 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes you want to see an actor leave everything on the floor. Were sadists that way we moviegoers. But when the acting is as masochistic as Jake Gyllenhaals is in Southpaw you wish hed keep a little something for himself. He plays a Hells Kitchen light heavyweight champ and whenever he opens his mouth you half-expect one of the DJs from Hot 97 to blast an air horn. (That accent is where somebody thinks hip-hop lives.) Gyllenhaal has made himself intimidatingly fit. The muscles on his fatless body ripple. The veins and striations form an interstate coursing with God only knows. His big eyes go Powerball crazy. If hes playing king of the boxing world Gyllenhaal makes sure the throne doubles as an electric chair. This weve been told is actors acting the explosiveness the training that accent. But one reason to wish Gyllenhall had gone for 7 or 8 out of 10 instead of 14 is that the movie isnt very good. To his credit this isnt the sort of performance designed to transcend a film; its meant to complement it. The movie written by Kurt Sutter and directed by Antoine Fuqua takes almost every boxing cliche imaginable but doesnt combine or stir them up. Each banality just sort of paces shamelessly back and forth flashing at you like a body in a red-light district. Gyllenhaals character Billy has just won his 43rd fight and his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) thinks thats a good number at which to hang it all up. Shes worried about his health and wants their 10-year-old bespectacled daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) to have a father. But Billys being taunted by a young upstart and at a banquet where Billy has just mumbled his way through a speech the kid and his crew take their shot -- and not just with their fists. A sloppily shot and edited melee ensues the fallout of which leaves Billy collapsed into addiction. He disobeys his wife and takes a fight for money (hes been overspending) then hits a referee during a bout and winds up losing his money home and family -- and has to you know fight his way back not just to the top but to Leila who gets sucked into the foster care system where she pretends to be better off. On one of Billys visits a friend asks ""Is that your dad?"" Leila does her best impersonation of an aggrieved girlfriend and answers ""I dont know anymore."" Later she slaps him and says she wishes he were dead. (Theres more where that came from.) Every time you think this guy has reached bottom the movie plunges him through yet another floor. The climb up requires a gym and a trainer and a job. Thank goodness for Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) whos able to provide Billy with all three. Messy old Tick is all washed up as a fighter which makes him ideal to turn his life over to Billy. Hes not just a rung to recovery; hes the whole ladder. Tick gives Billy all the skill hes never had including rhythm and good defense surprising weaknesses for a titleholder who when the movie starts had never lost a fight. Anyway Billy gets clean gets fit and tries to get beyond supervised visitation. Fuqua brought us Training Day and The Equalizer titles that easily apply to this new movie. ""Southpaw"" of course refers to Billys left hand and he deploys a last-minute in-ring head fake that sends ringside commentators Jim Lampley and Roy Jones Jr. into a tizzy. It must be said that this seems like an awful lot of movie just to discover that this guy can hit with his left. And Billys training sequences are canned into a montage that feels like a poor excuse to dump a new Eminem song into the soundtrack. (On the other hand the score is by James Horner who died in June. The movie has been dedicated to him and its the films most elegant touch.) Otherwise Fuqua seems content to make everything as basic and obvious as possible and Sutter who brought us the biker melodrama of Sons of Anarchy has cut-rate notions of emotional manipulation. (Dammit his is a custody battle fight drama) I dont know how you make an original boxing movie anymore. I dont think the first boxing films were all that fresh. Even in 1931 The Champ must have seemed old-fashioned. But there was natural pathos in its hoariness. In taking from evoking or just failing to think past that movie and about a dozen others Southpaw just makes this one seem tired. Its idea of pathos is mechanical and its depiction of an elite white boxer pads a Hollywood romance that no longer aligns with the reality of a sport that for 50 years has been dominated by black men and Latinos. (Andrew Lindsay explored this preoccupation in his book Boxing in Black and White A Statistical Study of Race in the Ring 1949-1983.) But what Sutter and Fuqua are doing with Southpaw feels like trolling. They dont even make Billy Italian American or ethnically Irish Hes just an orphan The black characters are here to support the white ones. (Naomie Harris plays a foster care administrator whose sole job it seems is to nanny Leila. 50 Cent plays Billys manager who knows to move on when Billy bottoms out.) And if youre going to make an original movie about a white boxer without setting off certain alarms of disbelief perhaps a name other than Billy ""The Great"" Hope is a good place to start. But this movie doesnt care for decorum. Its possible someone thought omitting the ""white"" after ""great""was a nod to subtlety. This kind of egregiousness threatens to upstage Gyllenhaals hard work which in itself is pretty flagrant but honest too. Hes now where Christian Bale was before The Fighter and American Hustle an aggressive mannerist. Hes got a clearer sense of humor and his daring has more than one note in movies like Source Code and End of Watch; he just played nerdy Seymour in a quickie revival of Little Shop of Horrors. But you long to see him take all of that skill and create something soulful or organically weird as opposed to the flamboyant nutjob he came up with for Nightcrawler where the work kept getting in the way. What if he took the lunatic flight that Nicolas Cage took while realizing unlike Cage that one side effect of going out on a limb is that the branch could break? The trouble with how hard Gyllenhaal goes in Southpaw is that hes in the service of weak material so you notice the effort. At some point as Billy Gyllenhaals screaming into a mattress with a gun and a bullet nearby and I found myself thinking Whos going to clean up the snot? Its a blinkered and anguished piece of acting committed to a movie that doesnt deserve it.  IFC Films Theres preposterousness and then there are the movies of Christian Petzold. Petzolds a German whose suspense melodramas -- 2009s Jerichow 2012s Barbara -- hinge on coincidences and plot twists so impossible so desperate that they just work anyway held together by his confidence in his storytelling. You might think his movies are dependent on insane collisions of conveniences. But for Petzold theyre part of a grand moral cosmos. Now hes back with Phoenix the strangest and most ambitious of his three most recent movies. Its also the most devastating in its efficiency and elegance. The story concerns Nelly Lenz (Nina Hoss) a Berlin lounge singer and Holocaust survivor whose horribly disfigured face is surgically reconstructed. The new one eventually looks just like Hoss fine-boned and enticingly big-eyed. This is the kind of movie -- or rather Petzold makes the kind of movie -- in which Nelly learns that Nazis have killed her family but all she wants to know is whether her husband Johannes (Ronald Zehrfeld) made it. You cant believe it but when you get a load of him (he definitely made it) all you can say in distasteful arousal is never mind. Zehrfeld is a strapping hunk with Clark Gables mustache and Gables way of a romantic kind of rudeness. Together before the war he and Nina were a musical duo. Now hes lifting boxes and wiping stuff down at a bar called Phoenix and doesnt recognize this arisen woman. Which is perfect since hes got a proposition His wife died in the camps and he needs someone to pretend to be her in order to collect the inheritance her family left. Nelly consents out of some combination of shock relief and intrigue against the wishes of the friend (Nina Kunzendorf) who has arranged for her new life. Theres no point in explaining where all of this goes. But Petzold is in command of it. By the time you know what hes up to the movies over and youre in a stupor. The endings brilliantly abrupt. Petzold continues the German tradition of melodrama that Rainer Werner Fassbinder took up during his peak in the 1970s and 80. There are many tensions here (sexual conjugal moral cosmetic artistic) that forget to breathe. Petzold mixes up many thrillers and films noir (from Hitchcocks to Georges Franjus) and extracts from them the drama of the double. At the Phoenix a pair of cabaret singers performs as a tandem. At some point a different act is seated at the bar and from behind they appear to be twins. Poor Nelly tolerates the advances of an American soldier only to hear someone inform him that hes caressing the wrong girl. In this second life she goes as Esther the biblical queen who deploys her secret Jewishness strategically. Petzold is having a ball with all of this resurrection and recombination -- and with Johannes who once went by ""Johnny"" exactly the sort of noir name a dame shouldnt trust. The movie itself is a reincarnation of Barbara which was set in 1980 Germany under the watch of the Stasi and in which Hoss and Zehrfeld were lovers in distrust. The deluded omniscience Zehrfeld played in Barbara is a willful obliviousness here. Johannes is so thoroughly convinced by Esther that you have to ask what did Nelly originally look like? Were her voice and demeanor reconstructed too? These are questions that Petzold in his baldness forces you to ask but here you accept the whole scheme -- his hatching it; her going along -- as entwined trauma. Thats all that Hoss is playing aftershock. She has to keep organized the layers of performance and pretending to grasp the order of the masks shes wearing and what it means to let one slip or to remove them entirely. Hoss has to do this while appearing to do very little at all to be hiding behind smiles and frowns. Its warm beautifully intelligent soulful acting thats confident enough to know that her cold stillness can singe. Shes the phoenix yes. But shes also the flame.  Sony Pictures Late-middle-period Adam Sandler is a crank nostalgist. ""Was"" is better than ""is"" adolescence better than adulthood fun better than family and with Pixels 1980s arcade games beat whatever single-player nonsense youre playing on your bed. The conceit is that once upon a time somebody space-launched a capsule loaded with classic video games which some alien race construed as an act of war. Out of plausible options the president (Kevin James) recruits his childhood best friend (Sandler) -- a former arcade-game champion turned lowly home-electronics technician -- to help the military vanquish Galaga and Centipede Pac-Man and Donkey Kong which in 3-D have just the right animated glow and sizzle as they attack live-action D.C. and London. But the movie just feels like a knocked-off Ghostbusters right down to the cheap coveralls and light guns. (Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage fill in the rest of the personnel blanks.) But wheres that movies screwball lunacy? This is just a lot of chomp-chomp-chomp and point tallies wafting upward whenever something game-oriented is blown up. Chris Columbus seems like the ideal director for stakes this low. His expertise is mildness. Im almost never quite as sorry I came to his movies as I thought Id be. Theres usually something. Here there are the threats from the aliens delivered by digitally manipulated 80s-era icons like Ronald Reagan Tammy Faye Bakker and chipper young Madonna. This is the movie at its most inspired. Theres a comic chill of doom in those warnings. Otherwise theres not much else just thoughtless government lacquer. But playing the president is the rare sign that Jamess onscreen self-image might have a capacity for loftiness. He even looks only mildly cowed by his scenes with Fiona Shaw who as the prime minister of England goes whole hog in speaking British gibberish. Dinklage puts on a trashy black-pimp accent and wants to be paid for his services in days and nights with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams. And the older and grouchier Sandler gets the more he seems like deadbeat Humphrey Bogart. To that end Michelle Monaghan as a pathetic divorcee who also happens to be a Defense Department muckety-muck is on hand to play verbal air hockey with him. As the first lady Jane Krakowski is on hand to impersonate air. As if the ho-hum-ness werent enough theres a procedural hypocrisy at work in the nostalgia. Most of the action set pieces are only loosely executed the way youd play say Donkey Kong. When a giant spaceship releases thousands of game characters over Washington the movie becomes the sort of dull shoot-em-up its railing against. Thats a problem only insofar as the movie doesnt actually know what game its trying to play.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 24 2015 Save for later Saved Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) squares off with Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) as Billys wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) looks on in Southpaw. Courtesy of Scott Garfield/The Weinstein Company          View Caption About video ads View Caption of I suppose every self-respecting actor has to play Hamlet at some point in his career and most of them have to play a down-and-out boxer too. I dont know if Jake Gyllenhaal has ever played Hamlet but here he is as light heavyweight champ Billy Hope in ""Southpaw"" complete with ripped physique and mashed face. This role is about as far from Gyllenhaals last one - as the creepo videographer in ""Nightcrawler"" - as you can get. He went in for some heavy emaciation in preparing for that role but at least you could see his eyes. (It helped that he rarely blinked.) In ""Southpaw"" one or both of Billys eyes are almost always hooded or blackened. Its a tribute to Gyllenhaals shape-shifty talents that ""Southpaw"" is as watchable as it is despite the fact that director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Kurt Sutter pummel the audience with so many hoary boxing movie cliches that at times the film resembles nothing so much as a Greatest Hits reel. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Whenever Ive mentioned this film to friends the response always comes back ""Why bother after Raging Bull?"" ""Southpaw"" doesnt simply draw on Scorseses film it also filches from such fare as ""The Set-Up"" ""Fat City"" ""Rocky"" ""Somebody Up There Likes Me"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" and especially ""The Champ"" (both versions). Its less an homage than a shameless attempt to push all our buttons. Its the greenest film in town - 100 percent recycled goods. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The film begins with Billy who mumbles a lot for that punchy-working-class-hero effect in the ring getting pummeled as per usual. His defensive game plan such as it is requires him to absorb blows until he seizes the knockout. Victorious but battered he hunkers down with his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) who implores him to quit the fight game. The trouble is she is imploring him from inside their palatial mansion and Billy doesnt really have any other skills to pay the piper and he has a posse of hangers-on and managers and promoters. (The shiftiest of them is played by Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson.) He also has a doting 11-year-old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) - this is where ""The Champ"" kicks in. She wears eyeglasses so we know shes meant to be wiser than her years.Until Maureen is alas no longer in the picture which comes about a half hour into the movie ""Southpaw"" overrides its cliche overload because of the intense chemistry between Gyllenhaal and McAdams. Both Billy and Maureen came up from the projects together and their devotion to each other is ferociously believable. (This is probably the best work McAdams has done in the movies.) Once we are left with Billy and the Kid the film veers into a deep rut of predictability and stays there. Billy you see has to overcome some big-time anger-management issues in order to wrest Leila from the custody of child services. He also finds it in himself to get back in the ring - against his nemesis of course. Billy takes on a trainer a crusty ex-boxer and a gym owner (well played by Forest Whitaker) who at first wants no part of Billys ordeal until he realizes its not the light heavyweight title Billy is trying to regain its his manhood. Like westerns boxing movies even the classics do indeed draw on genre cliches for their appeal. But the best of the boxing movies do more than satisfy our desire for the tried-and-true. They also surprise us; they subvert the genre or at least freshen it. ""Southpaw"" is so determinedly derivative that at times its almost insulting.Despite its supposedly hard-hitting veneer the film never goes out on a limb when it counts. Scant attention for example is devoted to the racial aspect of the story - to Billy as the Great White Hope. And some scenes are tone-deaf like the one in which Leila is permitted for the first time to watch her father fight on TV. She is watching him get severely bloodied and judging from her blinkless concentration were supposed to think shes a real sport - the second coming of her mother. But what comes across seems more like a form of abuse. Gyllenhaal is one of the most gifted actors of his generation and along with Joaquin Phoenix he takes more chances than just about any of them. He deserves a movie that risks as much as he does. Grade C+ (Rated R for language and some violence.)

Admitted technically its not a story about the Italian Stallion. Its from an original script by Jersey boy and ""Sons of Anarchy"" creator Kurt Sutter takes place mostly in New York and stars Jake Gyllenhaal. But this is still an old-fashioned boxing movie with all of Balboas favorite moves the good-hearted white boxer the plucky wife the family tragedies the early defeat - and then the bare-bones training regimen and the big rematch. Yo Adrian - theyre playin our song Yet ""Southpaw"" cant quite bring itself to committing to its own melodrama. It crosscuts its two fighters training sessions (but wont stoop to cueing up some ""Eye of the Tiger"" style tunes). It stages its bouts unrealistically - honestly light heavyweights do not spend 12 rounds punching each other in the head - but stops short of outright unbelievability. It wants to be taken seriously. That can be a challenge although the film is certainly easy to enjoy. It boasts a fierce performance by Jake Gyllenhaal who - after starving himself to play that murderous weasel in ""Nightcrawler"" - is now a hardbodied machine with a scarred face and a thick New York accent. And Rachel McAdams is just as terrific as his supportive wife who knew him since their days as a couple of kids in Hells Kitchen - although the scripts idea of what that neighborhood was even 20 years ago seems mostly based on old Jimmy Cagney movies. Then shoehorn in Forrest Whitaker as that sturdy cliche the battered old pugilist whos going to whip our bad boy into shape and add a cute kid right of ""The Champ."" And you have a classic Hollywood boxing movie primed to get up throw on its sweats and run through its sentimental paces - first act triumph and tragedy second act self-pity and self-renewal third act revenge and redemption. It does all of that easily thanks to Gyllenhaals ferocious performance as Billy Hope - yes Im afraid thats his name -- and Fuquas on-point directing. Hes always been a filmmaker interested in machismo and if his ambitions sometimes exceeded his grasp - ""Training Day"" and ""Brooklyns Finest"" came closest to realizing what he was trying to do - he knows what a movie should look like. The camera goes in close when it needs to especially in the ring. It pulls back at intimate moments - a crying jag in the bathroom a tender moment in the locker room - to give its characters space. But if Fuquas camera is focused Sutters script rarely is. Sometimes plot points are forgotten (like the investigation of an early accidental shooting) or never properly prepared (Billys decision on a new left-uppercut strategy). Sometimes theyre serious character developments that go undramatized. (Were told Billy has anger issues then later were told hes fixed them. But how exactly?) Yet the scenes of domestic life are truly touching (although the original music score James Horners last sometimes threatens to overwhelm them) and the fight scenes are terrific (even if theres an unreal rockem-sockem- robots feel to the choreography). The only real problem is that occasional feeling of strained seriousness - as if the movie were trying way too hard to be if not ""Raging Bull"" than at least ""The Fighter."" Which is a fine ambition but seriously out of its weight class. What this movie really is at heart is just a good-natured perfectly decent meat-and-potatoes palooka. It needs to tuck in its chin put up its dukes and embrace its inner lug. And real ""Rocky"" fans just need to be a little more patient and wait for ""Creed.""

Photo Credit AP / Scott Garfield advertisement | advertise on newsday Jake Gyllenhaal gets his ""Raging Bull"" on in ""Southpaw"" a boxing drama for which the actor transformed his slender physique into a 175-pound rack of rippling muscle. Hes a spectacular sight all pulsing veins and popping pecs topped by a terrific snarl. If those were the only requirements for a great boxing movie ""Southpaw"" would be a near-masterpiece. Instead ""Southpaw"" is a near-disaster. Its the story of Billy ""The Great"" Hope (Gyllenhaal) a light heavyweight champion who drinks away his career after his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) is killed. For the sake of his young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) Billy must get back on his feet and fight Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) who played a murky role in Maureens death. The basic premise -- the comeback -- is so sturdy and dependable that it would seem to be foolproof. Various iterations have resulted in many a ""Rocky"" two versions of ""The Champ"" and 2005s ""Cinderella Man"" to name just a few enjoyable examples. advertisement | advertise on newsday What sinks ""Southpaw"" is its mangled script by Kurt Sutter (creator of FXs ""Sons of Anarchy""). No cliche goes unused (Forest Whitaker plays the alcoholic half-blind gym manager Tick Wills) and no subplot goes unbotched (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson plays Billys manager a confusingly drawn frenemy whose motivations are never clear). The dialogue aims for street-gritty but lands instead on inarticulate-unimpressive ""You gotta let her go through her thing"" Tick advises Billy about his daughter ""and not think that her thing is your thing."" As for Gyllenhaal when hes not in the ring he mumbles through scenes like Marlon Brando by way of Robert De Niro. Southpaw trailerMore movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsPhotosBig movies out this summer A final note Gyllenhaals character seems to be named after Howard Sacklers play ""The Great White Hope"" based on the real-life search for a white heavyweight who could defeat the black champion Jack Johnson (1908-1915). Director Antoine Fuqua a lifelong boxer surely knows the play -- but why is it alluded to in ""Southpaw?"" Does it have something to do with the movies originally intended star Eminem -- a white rapper in a largely black field? The whole movie is full of such wild swings and in the end ""Southpaw"" knocks itself to the mat.

"Review Southpaw has solid Jake Gyllenhaal in ring but a contrived script - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Southpaw has solid Jake Gyllenhaal in ring but a contrived script Review Southpaw has solid Jake Gyllenhaal in ring Scott Garfield / Weinstein Co. Miguel Gomez left Beau Knapp Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams star in ""Southpaw."" Miguel Gomez left Beau Knapp Jake Gyllenhaal and Rachel McAdams star in ""Southpaw."" (Scott Garfield / Weinstein Co.) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter If you admire the shameless in cinema if you consider yourself a connoisseur of contrivance youre going to have to tip your glove in the direction of ""Southpaw"" a boxing melodrama so gleefully preposterous attention must be paid.Written by Kurt Sutter directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Jake Gyllenhaal in the latest of his totally immersive performances ""Southpaw"" is larded with the kind of improbabilities that would have impressed even the great contrivers of Hollywood past. Yet that said ""Southpaw"" is so logic-defying it takes on a Frankenstein life of its own especially with as energetic and focused an action maestro as Fuqua (""Training Day"" ""The Equalizer"") in charge.INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletter In fact viewers will be forgiven for being impressed by ""Southpaws"" logic-be-damned nerve in just going for it in believing its an original even though fans of sweet science cinema will recognize plot elements familiar from predecessors too numerous to name. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link Though its plot is a violent fairy tale the one thing about ""Southpaw"" thats said to be authentic is the way its boxing matches are conceived and photographed. Reverential shots by cinematographer Maurio Fiore of moments like hands being taped are the dominant aesthetic. Fuqua is a boxer himself and it was important to him that things look right inside the ring which is why HBO camera operators were brought in to shoot the films several matches.""Southpaw"" opens at one such event at New Yorks Madison Square Garden where undefeated world light-heavyweight champ Billy Hope (yes that really is the name of Gyllenhaals character) is defending his title with his knockout mini-skirted wife Maureen (an underutilized Rachel McAdams) shouting pointed encouragement from her ringside seat. Southpaw trailer Watch the trailer for ""Southpaw"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Watch the trailer for ""Southpaw"" starring Jake Gyllenhaal. See more videos Also at ringside is Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) a mouthy contender who wants his shot at the champ and doesnt care who knows it. If you think well be seeing more of Escobar later youve been peeking at the script. For those interested in the human angle (and who isnt?) it turns out Billy and Mo as he calls her were both products of the same Hells Kitchen orphanage where they bonded at age 12 and never looked back.As written by Sutter best known as the creator of ""Sons of Anarchy"" the tattooed Billy is a man with a hair-trigger temper outside the ring whos a total berserker inside it. Like the old Timex watches Billy can take a licking and keep on ticking and his boxing style such as it is is to take enough punishment to make him mad enough to retaliate. Well it works for him.Once Billy and Mo get home to the kind of palatial estate that would make Donald Trump jealous the champ turns out to be Mr. Softy with Leila (Oona Laurence) the brainy young daughter (she wears glasses) he loves to bits.Wife Mo meanwhile is worried about the wear on his body and mind her husbands masochistic fighting style might be causing. Billys all-business manager Jordan Mains (Curtis ""Fifty Cent"" Jackson) whose motto is ""If it makes money it makes sense"" wants him to sign a three-bout contract with HBO but Mo is not so sure.Then in a wild and crazy turn of events everything changes in a heartbeat and not for the better. It wouldnt be fair to give away too much plot nonsense but its always a safe assumption that things will have to get worse before they get better. A whole lot worse.Billys journey in ""Southpaws"" second half takes him to a classic rundown gym operated by Titus ""Tick"" Wills the films other major character. As played by Forest Whitaker Wills is a canny veteran trainer part Zen master part martinet who has forgotten more about boxing than most people will ever know.Whitaker has some nice moments here but the actor everyone will be noticing in this film is Gyllenhaal who as usual has completely thrown himself into this performance in a role that was written for rapper-actor Eminem.After training for six hours a day for six months -- one British tabloid breathlessly reported he got up to 2000 sit-ups -- Gyllenhaal is remarkably rock solid and moves in the ring like he knows what hes doing.But as impressive as this is -- and it is very impressive -- Billy does not seem an ideal match for Gyllenhaal. Many of his most memorable performances -- for instance Louis Bloom in ""Nightcrawler"" -- involve characters who have more visible intelligence than Billy is granted here. ""Southpaw"" is proof of contrivances clout but there is a limit to what it can do.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------SouthpawMPAA rating R for language throughout and some violenceRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Reviews Movies Entertainment Jake Gyllenhaal Life in pictures Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-southpaw-review-20150724-column.html,200,southpaw13,southpaw,latimes

A cut Jake Gyllenhaal (so so good in last years Nightcrawler) does a lot of quality mush-mouthed mumbling as a punched-up boxer who relies on his wife (Rachel McAdams) to do the brainwork but its director Antoine Fuqua who has bitten off more than he can chew with this overstuffed faintly ludicrous fight pic. See Billy Hope is the light heavyweight champion of the world -- except hes never learned to block a punch. Instead he takes the hits until they set him off and then goes nuts and lowers the boom. See also his life outside the ring. But when tragedy strikes hell have to find a new approach. Will it be through his court-mandated anger-management counselor? Or perhaps instead the half-blind proprietor/sensei of an inner city gym (Forest Whitaker) who spends his time trying to help troubled youth and who just happened to train the one man who ever beat Hope? Gyllenhaal gives his all but he cant make this one a winner. 2015. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by ""Sons of Anarchy"" creator Kurt Sutter the movie is at times a ham-fisted drama but a very fine example of the male melodrama. Most boxing movies have gone for a mix of might and sentimentalism since Sylvester Stallone ran up the stairs of the Philly Art Museum arms raised in one of the greatest training montages of all time. Like Mr. Balboa Billy can take a punch and another and another. And yes Billy has his hardscrabble story. He was raised in a Hells Kitchen orphanage a fact fight announcers like to bark a few too many times. (New York Citys once-rough Irish working-class West Side neighborhood has fallen on gentrified times.) These fight-night spiels are so cliched they could be taken as a jab at the puffed-up pronouncements of ring-side commentators and not just wobbly writing. Billy even has his own Adrian. Only wife Maureen is savvy about the biz and even more so about her beloved husband. Rachel McAdams portrays this knockout of a different order. She came from the same tough streets. She doesnt like seeing him pummeled but understands his talent and drive. Its a hard-knock life with authentic benefits. Theres love. Theres daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Yes there are moments when Billy walks like a man assaulted by punks in an alley. But Billys no underdog; hes reigning light-heavyweight champ. After the openers world title bout Maureen knows its time for Billy to take a break if not hang up his gloves. His longtime friend and manager Jordan has different plans. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson brings a controlled Mephistophelean vibe to the fight arranger. Their poolside squaring off over Billys future isnt overplayed. And Maureen looks like shell win in a decision. Then things take a rending dive. When Billy gets in the ring after Maureen is gone the announcers speak of a ""horrible accident."" Which struck this listener as a euphemism in the vein of ""collateral damage"" and ""friendly fire."" A skirmish between the short-tempered Billy and his utterly cocky foe Miguel Gomez (Miguel Escobar) leads to disaster. The loss stuns Billy. His grief plunges him into a narcissistic and volatile mood. Will he rise to his name and take care of his daughter? Is he down for the count? Did I mention this is a male melodrama? Not that theres anything wrong with that. In fact ""Southpaw"" tries to make sense of the cost of unchecked anger and the responsibilities of fatherhood and parenting. (They are not the same.) Forest Whitaker plies his strange calm as the gruff trainer who reluctantly gives Billy a chance. In Leilas corner -- because the kid needs a champion once dad plummets into a pit of grief -- is a social worker played by Naomie Harris. There are moments in the film when Gyllenhaal appears to be channeling verbal pugilist Marshall Mathers a.k.a. rapper Eminem. This is no accident -- Sutter wrote his initial screenplay for the performer. Eminem opted out of the picture but contributed two songs to the soundtrack ""Kings Never Die"" and ""Phenomenal."" The score is by James Horner who died in June in a plane crash. As for the in-the-ring bob weave clash clutch? Well those disappointed by Mays impossibly hyped Mayweather-Pacquiao bout should enjoy the care director Fuqua takes in delivering the sweet science to the big screen.

Scott Garfield/Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Scott Garfield/Weinstein Company Rachel McAdams as Maureen Hope and Jake Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope in Southpaw. Scott Garfield/Weinstein Company Dont call it a comeback The grimy boxing melodrama Southpaw is so old-fashioned and unsophisticated its almost new. Initiated as a remake of 1979s sap-soaked The Champ with Eminem in the lead role it morphed into yet another opportunity for Jake Gyllenhaal to prove hes a contender. When he finally gets that Oscar he so clearly covets itll likely as not be a make-up award for his spooky turn as a sociopathic TV news cameraman in Nightcrawler last year. Gyllenhaal isnt quite that good in Southpaw but hes still pretty great. The orphan-turned-ex-con-turned-light-heavyweight champion Gyllenhaal plays is named Billy Hope -- a sign of the degree of subtlety in Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutters screenplay wherein every plot turn is as telegraphed as a tomato cans jab. I didnt care Enough of it felt earned to me that Southpaw wins on points. With movies and TV inching ever closer to the meta singularity that will render all earnestness extinct a film that doubles down on performance and dares to tell a simple story simply feels vaguely punk rock. Or at least punk rock-era. In 70s-cinema terms Southpaw is a mashup of Rocky and Kramer vs. Kramer -- though it borrows more from the latter actually. When Billys wife (Rachel McAdams trading in her True Detective Ka-Bar collection for a slinky dress and big hoop earrings) exits the scene he falls into a tailspin losing his boxing license his manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) his fancy house and finally custody of his 10-year-old daughter Leila. (Oona Laurence avoids the cereal-commercial poise that makes most child actors so grating.) Billys need for income so that he can convince a judge that hes fit for fatherhood is what sends him to the gym run by Tick Wills who trained the only boxer ever to beat him. (Billy still got the decision but he suspects that was because someone in his camp paid a bribe. ""The fight game you know"" he shrugs.) Wills is the movies other bravura performance. Can it be true that the great Forest Whitaker has never played a crusty philosophically inclined fight trainer before now? With a glass eye that doesnt match his real one? Who is secretly a big softie who lets the neighborhood kids train for free but fines them 50 pushups for cursing? It seems impossible and yet IMDB insists tis so. Whatever Theres great pleasure to be had from watching Gyllenhaal and Whitaker play lonely inarticulate guys trying squint and grunt -- and above all sweat -- their way to revelation. The movie spends a lot of time alone with Billy and Leila too as he faithfully visits her hoping shell finally speak to him. Sutter actually does do some subtle work in these scenes never expecting us to care about this father-daughter relationship just because. Leila is more mature and rational than Billy and the movie is smart enough to realize thats not funny or cute; its a serious problem. Indeed Billy is the most nonverbal character Gyllenhaal has ever embodied frequently defeated by the labor of stringing sentences together. Rocky Balboa sounds like Ali at his rhyming-trash-talk peak compared to this guy. But its expressly because fight films emphasize discipline over eloquence that actors like Gyllenhaal -- the ones who seem to crave respect even more than wealth or fame -- cant resist them. Like (in chronological order) Robert De Niro Daniel Day-Lewis Will Smith Mark Wahlberg and Tom Hardy before Gyllenhaal trained hard for months to look and move like a champion. Southpaws press notes insist he didnt use a stunt double in the ring and director Antoine Fuqua -- an amateur fighter himself though he usually makes movies about cops or soldiers -- brought in HBO Boxing camera operators Todd Palladino and Rick Cypher to make the choreographed bouts look real. (David O. Russell did this in 2010s The Fighter too.) Naturally Fuqua takes advantage of the fact that these are staged fights to put his camera where it could never go in a real one. And as in every non-documentary boxing flick the blows seem to land more cleanly and with more immediate effect than in life. Still Southpaws fights are still visceral and involving. Once upon a time physical transformations like Gyllenhaals -- he half-starved himself for Nightcrawler then followed that up by making himself at least a convincing replica of an elite athlete -- were rare signifiers of an actors commitment. Fairly or not they feel less significant now that Hollywood has gone full-time into the superhero business spawning an entire sub-industry devoted to making youngish men from England Ireland Scotland Australia and on rare occasions the United States of America look like Jim Lee drawings. The difference is that playing Superman or Wolverine means making yourself look invulnerable while vulnerability and exhaustion are what boxing movies are all about. Southpaw sometimes carries that idea to a laughable extreme Gyllenhaals face is an oozing deep-dish pizza of bruises and lacerations in every scene even when months are supposed to have passed since his last fight. Still you cant blame the guy. Youve heard the expression that an actors face is his tool? Sometimes its his trophy too.

VPCRachel McAdams and Jake Gyllenhaal in the boxing drama Southpaw.(Photo Scott Garfield)Call him ""Joltin Jake"" Gyllenhaal because the actor adds needed presence and punch to the melodrama of Southpaw.As champ-turned-chump Billy Hope Gyllenhaal shines with the same intensity he showed in Jarhead and Nightcrawler and performances from him and Forest Whitaker lift up a movie that goes a full 12 rounds of rope-a-dope with every boxing-movie story trope.In a lot of ways Southpaw  ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is actually Rocky in reverse Instead of climbing up from nothing Billy starts off on top of the world as the light heavyweight champ who mounts no defense whatsoever in his bouts. ""As long as there is Billy there is Hope"" is the punny mantra sung by TV commentators. The more hits he takes the harder he fights back which very quickly becomes a metaphor for his life. (The title Southpaw refers to the stance of a left-handed boxer but also hints at his disadvantaged early life growing up an orphan.)Billys wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) tries to convince him to quit while hes ahead and put the punishment behind him. But pride doesnt let him and instead he eyes a hungry up-and-comer (Miguel Gomez) who talks a lot of trash and tells Billy hes ""never been hit by a real man.""USA TODAYThe gloves are off for Jake Gyllenhaal It leads to a string of seriously unfortunate events including the loss of his beloved wife his title and his entire fortune and -- worst of all -- Social Services taking his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) away. What once was the good life leaves him on the other side of the tracks where he started.Directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) and written by Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter Southpaw gets excessively grim. Just when you think Billy has hit rock bottom something else ridiculously bad happens mere minutes later.USA TODAYJake Gyllenhaal blows up in SouthpawIts a little unrealistic to imagine that a boxer with a 43-0 record would suddenly be washed up after a single loss but it does nicely set up the inevitable redemption around the corner. That comes in the form of wise old trainer ""Tick"" Wills (Whitaker) the Mickey to Billys Rocky who gives the guy a janitorial job during the day and at night teaches him how to fight in the ring and out of it.Whitaker takes what in anybody elses hands is a stock archetype and in powerful fashion makes Tick the most memorable of supporting players. Laurence stands out too as does Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson as Billys scheming manager.FOR THE WINPromotions for the movie Southpaw show Jake Gyllenhaal fighting orthodoxMuch like the Method performances of Rocky star Sylvester Stallone and Raging Bulls Robert De Niro before him Gyllenhaal has transformed his body into that of a physically imposing boxer ripped and sporting tattoos like the stylized ""Fear No Man"" that adorns his muscular back. Its one of his most physical roles and he spends most of the movie bloodied and bruised.Instead of a lot of dialogue the character is a study in emotional extremes. In some of the most heartwrenching scenes with Laurence Gyllenhaal exudes an unspoken frenzy while in the ring he lashes out in screaming fury.While Southpaw doesnt do anything innovative with the punch-drunk formula -- theres even a rousing final match leaving you exhausted by the end -- Gyllenhaal and Whitaker are real heavyweights who give the feature a winning combo.. 94 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1ML1SDq",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/07/23/review-gyllenhaal-packs-southpaw-punch/30527995/,200,southpaw17,southpaw,usatoday

Comments Southpaw Rated R  123 minutes  2015 For a while I wondered if this boxing drama might actually forego the climactic bout weve all come to expect; it didnt but just sustaining the possibility was enough to win me on points. A rags-to-riches knucklehead (Jake Gyllenhaal) resists the pleas of his loyal wife (Rachel McAdams) that he retire as light-heavyweight champion before he takes one too many punches to the skull. Soon afterward he loses her his title his fortune and custody of his daughter until putting on the gloves again is his only hope. Screenwriter Kurt Sutter ultimately falls prey to too many genre cliches but you have to admire a fight picture in which the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat both arrive outside the ring.

Rachel McAdams and Jake Gyllenhaal in ""Southpaw."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What happens when a fine actor is terribly miscast? Its like pushing a dancer into a minefield. Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding with verbose well-defined characters. As a sociopathic video newsman in last falls ""Nightcrawler"" he kept his electrifying wordy dialogue from ever feeling windy. With almost nothing to say he has less to do and little to contribute. ""Southpaw"" pulls him into a story that feels like a pulp 40s novel about boxing -- old material served warmed over. As a troubled slugger Gyllenhaal is impressively muscle-bound but gives no knockout performance. His work drags on like 12 rounds of fistfight fatigue. The film is two hours of raging bull. Gyllenhaal stars as boxing champ Billy Hope. As soon as you hear his name you know youre entering a film of simple metaphors and trite cliches. The world champion of his weight class Billy has used the ring to express all the resentment that he still carries from his youth in a Hells Kitchen orphanage. He has won four dozen fights not through savagery but a masochistic willingness to take every opponents punch until they are exhausted and ready for Billys knockout. The orphanage also introduced Billy to his lifelong love Mo (Rachel McAdams) equally abandoned. They have a loving marriage a charming daughter (Oona Laurence) and the uncountable gobs of money a boxing championship provides. The supportive brains of the operation Mo wants Billy to retire soon worried that a few more fights could leave him permanently punch drunk. He follows their ""you decide Ill provide"" arrangement until an unexpected tragedy involving a rival boxer knocks Billys livelihood and future to death row. And what way can he try to regain his life other than returning to the ring for vengeance? The screenplay credited to ""Sons of Anarchy"" creator Kurt Sutter follows a story arc somewhere between ancient history and prehistoric. The penniless Billy meets a hard-nosed veteran trainer (played with never-say-die gusto by the legendary Forest Whitaker) who leads him through the same workout montages you have seen a thousand times before. Whitaker owns every moment of their conversations while the star murmurs and mutters. Gyllenhaal spends more time than he should in macho daddy scenes with Laurence one of the most theatrical look-at-me-act young performers I have seen. The hyperviolent boxing scenes draw the most attention from director Antoine Fuqua who has nothing on his mind except ""Southpaws"" look. Thats a sad state of affairs because he made 2001s ""Training Day"" one of the best thrillers in the past 20 years. Here Fuqua employs trick fight ring effects like point of view shots and shifting focus but he shoots every sequence without style or substance. Half-second slices of uppercut jab straight right and wide swing build to utterly predictable conclusions. How and why reason and meaning not so much. If we want great visuals alone we can go to a visual art exhibit. Without a solid story there is no movie. Southpaw  out of 4 stars Rating R for language throughout and some violence. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson the hip-hop star who plays Billys less than trustworthy manager made headlines similar to the heros story line last week as he filed for bankruptcy after losing his fortune. I think the film had something to do with it. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Its hard to watch a boxing match without developing a rooting interest. Sometimes its a simple matter of racial or class connection. Other times especially in pre-fight publicity or on-screen depicitions of a bout a storyline gets imposed on the match. Good vs. bad. Underdog vs. champion. Soviet vs. Philadelphian.The ""Rocky"" movies milked the melodrama from such situations but the sweet palooka protagonist made them easy to stomach (if not believe). ""Southpaw"" directed by Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") dwells in a grittier corner of the ring.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the title character a left-handed boxer named Billy Hope. (Presumably the name ""Whitey Hope"" was already copyrighted.) Like sexy supportive wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) Billy was raised in New Yorks foster-care system. Hes the undefeated light-heavyweight champion with a Bentley and a big estate in the suburbs but at heart hes a family man and wont let precocious daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) attend his inevitably bloody matches. The only credible contender for Billys title is big-mouthed Colombian boxer Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez). But when Escobar taunts Billy in public fists fly guns fire and a beloved member of Billys entourage dies. (Fuqua films the hectic death at such close range that were not sure who is responsible and solving the crime is a virtual afterthought for the rest of the movie.)In full grief mode Billy slides into a self-destructive drunken depression. Soon hes the pariah of the boxing world and an unfit father for Leila. As many of us have learned the hard way when you hit rock bottom there is only one person to turn to Forest Whitaker. He plays Tick Willis a grizzled no-nonsense trainer who runs a community-outreach gym in a dicey part of town. Billy hopes Tick can give him a last shot at the title -- and revenge. Whitaker of course is an Oscar winner (for ""The Last King of Scotland"") and Gyllenhaal is a nominee (for ""Brokeback Mountain"") so the acting in the movie is very good. Gyllenhaal has been on a body-modification kick since losing weight for his great performance in last years ""Nightcrawler."" Here covered in love-of-family tattoos hes got the believable build and footwork of a boxer.Fuqua is a proficient action director and the boxing scenes deliver plenty of whomp. But the music-saturated scenes involving the media the law and a turncoat friend played by Curtis (""50 Cent"") Jackson are trying to appeal to fans of ""Empire"" not ""Raging Bull."" Theres even a training montage set to an Eminem rap. So although ""Southpaw"" has some punch its not exactly coming from left field.What ""Southpaw""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 203  Rating R  Content Strong language throughout and bloody violence Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Jake Gyllenhaal Joe Williams Forest Whitaker Rachel Mcadams Southpaw Boxing Rocky Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

VPCJake Gyllenhaal impresses as a champion boxer who loses everything and fights to get it back but his workout routine is the most impressive thing about this boilerplate sports flick.Jake Gyllenhaals performance carries Southpaw farther than it deserves.(Photo The Weinstein Company)Story HighlightsIn this riches-to-rags-to-riches story narrative beats have all the subtlety of an uppercut.Jake Gyllenhaal all but carries the film on his buff and tattooed shouldersCritics rating 3 stars out of 5Boxing films have a rich history in Hollywood. Its the sport of metaphors of internal battles made external and it takes a deft hand (and pen) not to pummel the audience with that tidy correlation like so many jabs to the ribs. Director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"" ""Olympus Has Fallen"") is not that deft hand and writer Kurt Sutter (TVs ""Sons of Anarchy"") is not that deft pen which is how you end up with a main character with a name as obvious as Billy Hope.""Obvious"" is a good descriptor for ""Southpaw"" a riches-to-rags-to-riches story whose narrative beats have all the subtlety of an uppercut. Fuquas kinetic -- one might say restless -- style makes for some lively boxing sequences; even when a matchs outcome is telegraphed from a million miles away one is still moved to watch timidly through latticed fingers. But Fuqua brings little of that energy to the drama leaving Jake Gyllenhaal to do most of the heavy lifting. He all but carries the film on his buff and tattooed shoulders but the weight of familiarity proves too much for even a light heavyweight champion.Thats what Hope is at the start of the film a champion albeit a battered one who in an act of tortured symbolism only fights as hard as he gets hit. He goes home with his title to his stunning wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams whos given little more to do than fill out a dress nicely) and their bright young daughter.Hopes journey for catharsis might be worth it if it werent so predictable (Photo The Weinstein Company)Despite their palatial digs and casual acts of conspicuous consumption -- Cartier watches are bandied about like party favors -- theyre a remarkably grounded family. A pair of orphans from Hells Kitchen Hope and Maureen pay tribute to their good fortune and their ability to provide a good life for their daughter.When youre that high up on the totem pole of life theres only one way to go down. And Hopes fall is cruelly (one might even say incredulously) precipitous. Hopes beef with a showboating upstart boxer and his general lack of impulse control pave the way for a family tragedy that upends Hopes life. In a flash he loses everything even his manager (played by the not-terribly-convincing 50 Cent) whose loyalty can be gauged by his catchphrase ""If it makes money it makes sense.""AZCENTRALSouthpaw (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsGyllenhaal went through an incredible transformation to play Hope. Hes all sweat and grimace muscle and sinew and he strains against the losing side of life like a chained dog. Its a transformation all the more radical for Gyllenhaals performance in last years ""Nightcrawler"" where the actor appeared gaunt and spectral.Its a brutal performance in a film that sometimes looks more like a music video. He gets an assist from Forest Whitaker who plays the hardscrabble owner of a boxing gym in a rough neighborhood. Like Gyllenhaal Whitaker does his damnedest to freshen up the decidedly stale material; there is no dearth of inspirational boxing coaches in Hollywood. ""Its not about this"" he says pointing to his clenched fist. Then pointing to his head says ""Its about this.""But ""Southpaw"" is all about the fist. Theres no delicate footwork here no lingering grace notes. Its a film played entirely in power chords.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

"Faces punched hearts tugged Southpaw review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFaces punched hearts tugged Southpaw reviewBoxing drama Southpaw is as subtle as a punch to the face which is the way of director Antoine Fuqua. But its also satisfying movie drama thanks mainly to Jake Gyllenhaal and young Oona Laurence.Jake Gyllenhaal packs plenty of punch both emotionally and physically as Billy Hope in Southpaw.  (Scott Garfield / The Associated Press)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 23 2015SouthpawStarring Jake Gyllenhaal Forest Whitaker Rachel McAdams Oona Laurence Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson and Naomie Harris. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. At GTA theatres. 124 minutes. 14A""Fighter"" on the left. ""Father"" on the right.The story of Southpaw can be read in these two words elegantly tattooed on the forearms of Jake Gyllenhaals boxer character Billy Hope.Article Continued BelowHes desperately struggling to remain in the ring and also to be a good dad to his young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence).Thats as deep as this movie gets. Its as subtle as a punch to the face which is the way of director Antoine Fuqua. Think Rocky rather than Raging Bull and dont spend time wondering how soon screenwriters Kurt Sutter (TVs Sons of Anarchy) and Richard Wenk (The Mechanic) will reference The Great White Hope. Its all coming but then so is the heat from Gyllenhaal who transcends even the most mundane of material. Last years Nightcrawler showcased both his bodily and mental skills as an actor as he disappeared into the role of a bottom-feeding TV newshound.This ones much more physical. Its as raw as Billys left eye which bleeds from steady right hooks. The most savage of them come from rival Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) whose war with Billy extends past the ropes.Gyllenhaal commands the screen as furiously as he does the ring in a role originally planned for Eminem (the rapper moved to the soundtrack).Billy pummels his way at the outset to become Junior Middleweight boxing champion of the world. He doesnt have much to say but he has an adoring daughter a loving wife (Rachel McAdams) and a manager/friend (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) determined to help him stay on top and in the long green.Its all good -- but suddenly it becomes all bad. Billy hits the skids hard. The fight for his career and family will require more than brute force.Enter Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) a gruff ex-fighter and current trainer of New Yorks scrappiest and neediest amateur boxers. Will he help Billy?The answers obvious but the many merits of Southpaw may not be. This isnt great cinema but its satisfying movie-making with nothing more on its mind than telling a heart-tugging story.Fuqua knows his way around a ring. Hes in so tight it feels at times like the camera is getting punched.His casting choices are aces especially rising star Laurence age 12 for the significant role of Leila. Shes as convincing as Gyllenhaal in a film that earns its tears and cheers even as it telegraphs its punches.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday July 23 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Billy (Jake Gyllenhaal) doesnt stand by his manager (50 Cent) after tragedy strikes. (Scott Garfield/The Weinstein Company) Jake Gyllenhaal undergoes yet another startling physical transformation in ""Southpaw"" a by-the-numbers boxing picture that benefits considerably from its stars tenacious fiercely obvious commitment. No one will accuse Gyllenhaal of phoning it in on ""Southpaw"" in which he plays a down-on-his-luck fighter struggling to make his big comeback. He grunts and punches and scratches and glares it in bleeding copiously in set pieces that thud and splatter with woozy percussively potent verisimilitude. Put more simply theres a lot of punching in ""Southpaw"" which combines the training narrative from ""Rocky"" the visceral ringside energy of ""Raging Bull"" and the rank melodrama of ""Million Dollar Baby"" to make something if not new then at least stylish in its derivativeness. Gyllenhaal plays Billy Hope once an orphan in Hells Kitchen now the light heavyweight champion of the world living in nouveau-riche splendor with his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and their cute down-to-earth daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). ""Southpaw"" is not a rags-to-riches story Billy is already on top of the world when the movie opens lavishing his entourage with Cartier swag and contemplating a 30 million contract with HBO. When the reigning junior middleweight boxing champion (Jake Gyllenhaal) is struck by a horrific tragedy a domino affect causes him to lose his daughter manager and home. Now he has to work to get all that he loves back with the help of a new trainer. (Weinstein Co.) That all changes when tragedy ensues and Billy is forced to overcome grief avenge his personal loss rescue his career and put his family back together. It should surprise no one that this endeavor entails trading his flashy manager Jordan Mains played with understated elan by 50 Cent for Tick Wills a quiet corner man from a scruffy neighborhood gym. A font of shamanic wisdom -- delivered by way of Forest Whitakers brooding iconic whisper -- he joins a long line of such magical helpmeets from Morgan Freemans Scrap-Iron Dupris to Will Smiths Bagger Vance. Filmed with a de-saturated palette and painfully graphic close-ups by Antoine Fuqua ""Southpaw"" plays like a musical in which the performance numbers are its fights a pageant of beat-downs bloodlettings and bodies plummeting to the canvas like so many felled sequoias. Gyllenhaal proves himself a compelling even mesmerizing presence amidst the action even at its most hyperbolic and cliched. In last years ""Nightcrawler"" he was alarmingly emaciated and wild-eyed giving off a mangy half-feral vibe. Here hes beefed up impressively cut and prodigiously tattooed his face reduced to a barely recognizable pulp of scrapes lacerations bulges and bruises. When ""Southpaw"" switches tracks from revenge narrative to redemption tale Gyllenhaal doesnt skip a beat. He even makes the de rigueur makeover montage -- shots of him tossing around the ol medicine ball and hitting a truck tire with a sledgehammer -- less banal and more convincing than it deserves to be. ""Southpaw"" may be rote predictable and mawkish but none of those faults lie in its star. Even when he looks like an unholy mess he transcends the movie hes in. R. At area theaters.

"Southpaw movie review Jake Gyllenhaal fights through tragedy - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Southpaw review Jake Gyllenhaals boxer fights through shameless cliches Rachel McAdams and Jake Gyllenhaal Scott Garfield / The Weinstein Company Rachel McAdams and Jake Gyllenhaal play a married couple in the boxing drama ""Southpaw."" Rachel McAdams and Jake Gyllenhaal play a married couple in the boxing drama ""Southpaw."" (Scott Garfield / The Weinstein Company) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Jake Gyllenhaal fights for his daughter his self-respect amp; his abs in boxing movie Southpaw A flurry of haymakers in the form of boxing movie cliches ""Southpaw"" was conceived as a loose remake of ""The Champ"" -- Wallace Beery in 1931 Jon Voight in 1979 -- tailored for Marshall Mathers also known as Eminem. The rage-iest rap star on the planet took the initial meetings with director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Kurt Sutter. Eminem eventually bowed out affording Fuqua (""Training Day"" ""The Equalizer"") and Sutter (""The Shield"" ""Sons of Anarchy"") the leeway to rework the project for Jake Gyllenhaal.Does it succeed? Sort of. It helps if you dont mind your boxing movies made up of massive granite chunks of previous boxing movies. Just dont confuse ""Southpaw"" with a really good example of the genre and its ringside dramatic possibilities whether old (""The Set-Up"" ""Champion"") or newer (""Raging Bull"" or the less grandiose ""The Fighter""). The script may have hamburger for brains but Fuqua slams it home with the help of actors who give their all -- even when giving a little less might have made things more interesting. ""Southpaw"" starts not at the bottom or the middle of a fighters career but the tippy-top. Billy ""The Great"" Hope the Gyllenhaal character survived a bruising childhood in a Hells Kitchen orphanage alongside his childhood sweetheart Maureen. People can talk all they want about Gyllenhaal reinventing himself physically for ""Southpaw"" but as Maureen Rachel McAdams does an impressive reinvention job in an atypically gritty role without all the gym time.Life is good for Billy and Maureen now married with a sweet bespectacled moppet of a daughter (Oona Laurence). Billys the light heavyweight champ with 43 straight ring victories. In narrative terms hes just begging for a tragedy. When shots ring out after Billys charity event argument with an up-and-coming trash-talking boxer (Miguel Gomez) the world cracks open. Billy spirals into near-instantaneous poverty unemployment heavy drinking suicidal craziness and indecipherable levels of Method mumbles while his daughter is taken into custody of child services. Quicker than you can say ""I want my daughter back"" Billys in court screaming ""I want my daughter back"" while his manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) offers a sympathetic but unreliable shoulder to cry on. Gyllenhaals never comfortable playing fast talkers; hes more of a slow burner. In ""Southpaw"" each new slow burn leads to overturned chairs and tables followed by handheld close-ups of Gyllenhaals grief and anguish. Billy must learn to be a smarter less angry warrior in the ring. The champ must retrain himself for life inside and outside the ring under the tutelage of wizened trainer Tick Willis. Hes played by the formidable and ever-welcome Forest Whitaker whose way of humanizing artificial constructs borders on the miraculous. ""Stopping punches with your face -- thats not defense"" Whitaker says in one of the better lines. Southpaw trailer video ""Southpaw"" is a drama starring Jake Gyllenhaal Forest Whitaker Rachel McAdams Naomie Harris Victor Ortiz and 50 Cent. The film is the story of famous boxer Billy ""The Great"" Hope. It is the story of his life and how he became who he is. This powerful film opens on July 24 2015.

The fights look like a hundred other fights weve seen in the movies with slightly zazzed sped-up action and quick cutting thats more expedient than inspired.

Onscreen in Nightcrawler Enemy and Prisoners and onstage in Constellations Little Shop of Horrors and If There Is I Havent Found It Yet he shows the kind of versatility and commitment that should have won him prizes. The awards didnt materialize but its just a matter of time. Maybe itll be for Southpaw a retro in-your-face fight drama that dribbles into sappiness. Much though far from all is redeemed by Gyllenhaals virtuoso performance. The actor 34 trained for four months and gained 15 pounds of muscle to play light-heavyweight champ Billy Hope. But the externals -- scars tattoos and slurred voice -- dont begin to suggest the emotional depths Gyllenhaal brings to the part of a bruiser on the ropes.

His wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) wants him to slow down and enjoy their 11-year-old daughter Leila (a feisty Oona Laurence). Maureen is way more than lacquered hair nails and spray tan. She and Billy were raised in Hells Kitchen orphanages. McAdams strong and smoldering is explosively good. Spoiler alert Her role is shortened when Maureen is involved in a shooting accident sparked by Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) a fighter who thinks he can goad Billy into taking him on for high stakes. Director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day The Equalizer) working from an overcooked screenplay by Kurt Sutter (Sons of Anarchy) knows hes not in the same ring with Raging Bull Rocky Million Dollar Baby and The Fighter though the script unblushingly mooches from each of them. Still Fuqua shuffles the tools of the genre with genuine flair. As tragedy lands Billy in the pits of desperation poverty and child-custody battles Fuqua shifts focus from Billys crooked agent (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) to a trainer-savior Tick Wills (the expert Forest Whitaker) who teaches Billy a new fighting style that doesnt involve stopping punches with his head. The powerful boxing scenes vividly shot from Madison Square Garden to Vegas by Mauro Fiore and edited by John Refoua help distract from the father-daughter scenes that outdo The Champ (the Wallace Beery original and the Jon Voight remake) for gooey sentiment. Amazingly Gyllenhaal never cheats on his characters sense of dignity. Against the odds he keeps you in Billys corner. Thats a champ.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Jake Gyllenhaal has played cops soldiers even time-traveling action heroes but hes never looked less meek and sensitive less Donnie Darko than he does in Southpaw. As Billy Hope a pugilist going several rounds with his personal demons the actor sports a military buzz cut a chin caked in dark stubble and mounds upon mounds of glistening muscle. Its a real blood sweat and tears kind of performance extra emphasis on the blood Crimson drips perpetually from a swollen eye or dangles from a clenched jaw leaving red stains everywhere--on shirt collars on pillowcases on battered flesh. Physically speaking the transformation is as impressive as the one Gyllenhaal underwent a year ago to embody the gaunt wiry sociopath of Nightcrawler. But was this character a boxer battling the myriad conventions of his genre really worth the training regimen that brought him to life?There are plenty of rags to riches stories. Southpaw is more riches to rags to riches again with an extra dip into the rags column if you count Billys hard-knock-life upbringing. Rather than tell the origin story of an ex-convict who grew up in a Hells Kitchen orphanage the film cuts straight to his glory days as the Light Heavyweight champion of the world rocking a 43-0 undefeated streak and winning his fourth consecutive title fight. Billys plan of attack is to let the other guy knock him around a little bit until hes angry enough to unleash the Raging Bull within. But that hair-trigger temper is less productive outside of the ring as Billy learns when his beloved wife (Rachel McAdams) is accidentally shot and killed during a brawl with an instigating rival. Tortured by self-destructive anguish our hero quickly loses his belt his money his mansion his disloyal manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) and his adorably bespectacled daughter (Oona Laurence) whos taken away by Child Protective Services.Is Billy Hope down and out for good? His last name certainly not coincidental should be some indication otherwise. After a sufficient brooding-in-the-shower period the boxer stumbles into what looks like the gym from Million Dollar Baby complete with a very Clint Eastwood-friendly lighting scheme and begins training under a seasoned seen-it-all crabapple (Forest Whitaker whose lazy eye is incorporated into the narrative). ""Boxing is like a chess game"" the old man tells the younger man having apparently gathered all his pearls of wisdom from other movies. When not cleaning up after young gym rats--a real low for this recent millionaire--Billy hits speed bags during the kind of training montages Rocky IV should have permanently put out of commission.Southpaw was originally conceived as a starring vehicle for Eminem autobiographic in a loose and strictly metaphorical manner. Residue of the rappers involvement remains and not just in the bombastic soundtrack cut he ended up supplying The film has the corny underdog trajectory and cloying father-daughter material of a Slim Shady anthem; its maybe closer in spirit to ""Lose Yourself"" than 8 Mile was. Working from a macho-sentimental screenplay by Sons Of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter director Antoine Fuqua (Training Day several joyless action movies that are not Training Day) only seems invested when Billy has his gloves on. The boxing scenes shot by HBO fight-night veterans are much more dramatic and authentic than the moments when people arent punching each other. Gyllenhaal likewise comes alive when hes in the ring--he looks fairly natural ducking and weaving and jabbing--but cant do much with a role that seems tailored to the persona and more limited acting range of Marshall Mathers.Actually had Eminem actually appeared in Southpaw theres a good chance it would have at least felt more personal its cliches enlivened by the spectacle of an artist playing a proxy version of himself. What we get instead is a mostly humorless ""gritty"" run-of-the-mill sports drama about a weathered slugger who just wants to get his kid back and whose road to redemption leads straight to a climactic showdown in Las Vegas with the cartoonishly despicable opponent (Miguel Gomez) who indirectly killed his wife. The film drums up some disdain for the opportunistic boxing promoters who would set up such a revenge-themed fight as though it werent orchestrating that very same fictional bout itself. Beyond a solidly rousing score by the late James Horner and a couple of well-staged matches all Southpaw really has going for it is the athletic conviction of its star putting on the pounds to credibly portray a top-ranked prizefighter. But all of Gyllenhaals discipline and drive is misdirected; its wasted energy a cinematic rope-a-dope.

Photo The Weinstein Company MOVIE REVIEW Southpaw Running time 123 minutes. Rated R (profanity bloody boxing violence). The finest 1947 boxing picture of 2015 is here ""Southpaw"" a film thats gruntingly insistent on its cliches. It brings back every stale genre convention you can think of then hopes you wont recognize predictability pumped up with swearing and steroids and an Eminem song during the training montage. Mainly the movie is a showcase for a chemically enhanced Jake Gyllenhaal sporting shelves of store-bought muscle and confusing bodily transformation with craft. As for his twitching mumbling mewling capital-A Anguished performance at times it veers from ""acting"" to ""overacting"" to ""Nicolas Cage."" Rachel McAdams and Jake GyllenhaalPhoto The Weinstein Company Gyllenhaal plays a fighter named Billy Hope () who enjoys a luxe life with his hot wife (Rachel McAdams) and his adorable daughter (Oona Laurence) whose birth date and name he has tattooed on his chest. He also has ""Father"" and ""Fighter"" on his forearms just like director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"" and many mediocre genre films) loves to tell us what he should be showing -- then italicizes it boldfaces it underlines it and has the ringside announcers shout it. Billy and the missus have a love enduring because both grew up in the same orphanage in Hells Kitchen Was their first date a Bowery Boys picture at the Rialto? After a misfortune Billy loses everything. He parts ways with his promoter (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) and having apparently learned everything he knows about money from that financial wizard soon has a net worth of about 25 cents. Jake Gyllenhaal (left) and Curtis ""50 Cent"" JacksonPhoto The Weinstein Company So he must tear down body and soul by taking a humble job swabbing the decks at a workingmans gym run by a grizzled-but-loving one-eyed trainer (Forest Whitaker). Tick the new trainer has one ironclad rule He doesnt train pro fighters. So how will we get past this insurmountable obstacle so Billy can climb back into the ring again? Tick will simply change his mind. Also hell straighten out Billys game by teaching him a revolutionary new technique known as ""ducking."" In the big fight theres a girl waiting backstage and a strategic decision for Billy to lead with his non-dominant hand. Ever seen those ideas used before? The shameless ""Southpaw"" script by Kurt Sutter isnt written Its recycled. And as is often the case with recycling its hard to distinguish it from a bag of garbage.

Movie review of ""Southpaw"" This cliche-ridden boxing movie with a theme of redemption is redeemed by the fine performances of Jake Gyllenhaal as a hard-luck fighter and Forest Whitaker as a hard-nosed trainer. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times ""Southpaw"" a boxing movie with a theme of redemption is redeemed by the performances of its two main actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker. Its script by Kurt Sutter is a compendium of every boxing-movie cliche imaginable. Obviously a product of the Stacked Deck school of screenwriting Sutter burdens hardscrabble hero Billy Hope (Gyllenhaal) with a string of travails that would make Job weep. Movie Review 1/2   Southpaw with Jake Gyllenhaal Forest Whitaker Oona Laurence Rachel McAdams. Directed by Antoine Fuqua from a screenplay by Kurt Sutter. 124 minutes. Rated R for language throughout and violence. Several theaters. A champion light heavyweight with a 43-0 record a humongous mansion a loving wife (Rachel McAdams) and a cute-as-a-button young daughter (Oona Laurence) at the start he loses every last thing he values -- title mansion money family friends -- before the picture is a quarter over. And then down and out battered and grieving he must somehow climb out of his slough of despond toward redemption. Which of course must come in the ring with a climactic and superbloody prize fight.

But the strength of the performances by Gyllenhaal and Whitaker elevate it to quality hokum. Whitakers character a hard-nosed boxing coach named Tick Willis who owns a crummy inner-city gym doesnt show up until around a third of the way through the movie. Until then Sutter and director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") slather on the melodrama with a trowel. But in the midst of it all Gyllenhaal keeps things interesting with a many shaded portrait of despair. And then Whitaker enters the picture and ""Southpaw"" turns into a duet of fine acting. In dark places -- a low-rent bar the nighttime gym -- Tick becomes mentor and trainer pinpointing Billys greatest weakness his hair-trigger temper and instructs him how to fight with his brain rather than his usual method of ""stopping punches with your face."" Billy struggles to learn and reform and Gyllenhaal makes that internalized struggle achingly palpable. The final bout a jolting bloodstained catharsis is red meat for fight-movie fans but its the acting that precedes it that is ""Southpaws"" real strength.

Related links The 25 best boxing films of all time Interview Jake Gyllenhaal By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Jul. 23 2015 Thursday Jul. 23 2015 Friday Jul. 24 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Anyone who has ever seen a glimpse of a sports movie can suss out where the boxing drama Southpaw is headed well before the final bell. Boy grabs brass ring boy loses brass ring boy tears soul and sinew trying to get it back.But that doesnt matter. In the latest deep dive into the testosterone-drenched world of director Antoine Fuqua (The Equalizer Training Day) and writer Kurt Sutter (Sons of Anarchy The Shield) its not as much about the what but the how. Southpaw doesnt try to reinvent the boxing-movie game -- in fact it pretty much indulges every cliche -- but its the intense central performance from a beefed up ripped-to-the-core Jake Gyllenhaal that gives it distinction and heart.Gyllenhaal is Billy Hope a strutting rooster in the ring who may not have a lot of style and grace but that doesnt matter when he pile-drives his fist into your jaw. The orphan kid who once had nothing now has it all enough money to make Midas say ""whoa""; a house as big as a shopping mall; a beautiful wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) a cute daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) who adores him; and of course a championship. Does life get any better?But feisty up-and-comer Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) haunts Billy like a phantom showing up at press conferences to taunt him asking why Billy wont fight him.Billys manager Jordan (50 Cent) doesnt want his client to take the bait. But when Miguel and his crew start puffing their chests around Billy and his boys during a dressy gala someone pulls a weapon and in the instant Maureen is killed and Billys world crashes to the ground like a house of glass.He cant fight anymore and as his life mental state and finances spin out of control the courts take Leila away because hes a danger to himself and others.After the long slide down he decides to get his act together starts working out with a past-his-prime trainer (Forest Whitaker) at a rundown gym learns that fighting is about more than sheer power and attempts a comeback. Because in movies like this aging trainers in squalid gyms always have a few life secrets they can impart to the once successful and foolish.Its hard to know what Southpaw would have been like if the filmmakers first choice for the role Eminem had decided to put down the mike and put on the gloves. But its doubtful he could have had any of the sheer swagger and palpable vulnerability Gyllenhaal manages over the course of the film.Gyllenhaal is one of this eras best young actors something he has proven through a variety of tough roles over the years from Brokeback Mountain End of Watch and Enemy to Nightcrawler where his turn as an ambitious and insidious video journalist should have garnered an Oscar nomination. He brings to Billy a sense of humanity that goes beyond the script even when the plot careens into melodrama.The rest of the cast is good as well with the always solid Whitaker turning in an especially strong performance. And the film moves quickly through its two hours with Fuqua shooting the boxing scenes with a visceral in-your-face sensibility eschewing any artier Raging Bull intentions.But its Gyllenhaal -- bloody beaten yet unbowed -- who burns deepest in the memory once the sound of the bell has faded.

Photo DreamWorks Image 45 of 45 Southpaw -- more than a boxing movie 1 / 45 Back to Gallery Were far enough into the year to be able to say that ""Southpaw"" is one of the great films of 2015. Its a boxing movie that hits most of the stations of the boxing genre -- the cruelty of the business the devotion of the trainer and the ring as the crucible of disgrace or redemption -- but its nothing like a formula film. The experience of ""Southpaw"" is rather like seeing the truth behind the cliches revived in all their pain and power to surprise. ""Southpaw"" was directed by Antoine Fuqua whose great credit is ""Training Day"" but who has made all kinds of movies of varying quality though his films are usually a little better than their screenplays. ""Southpaw"" is a great example of what can happen when you give a superior director a script that challenges him that calls for something new and something more. Fuqua delivers a complete world and a sustained mood with camera work thats not merely arresting but also psychologically acute. At the center of it all is Jake Gyllenhaal who was rail thin in ""Nightcrawler"" just last year but now is transformed into 175 pounds of muscle. Hes Billy Hope the light heavyweight champ a man of action not a thinker whose feelings go deep but whose anger is close to the surface. Hes a complicated man and no one understands him but his woman but shes the ideal partner. She handles his business calms him down sees into his depths and makes him laugh. And because shes played by Rachel McAdams who exudes confidence and competence we know hes in good hands. One of the first hints that ""Southpaw"" is something special comes in an early scene between McAdams and Gyllenhaal in which they talk in their bedroom after one of his fights. The conversation covers lots of ground and goes from tenderness to contention to resolution. Screenwriter Kurt Sutter distills their relationship their fears and their vision of the future while the camera stays mostly on their faces in gently hovering close-ups that take the viewer right into their intimacy. Another early hint a seemingly minor thing is that even though Billy wins his fight hes still a mess. Hes coughing up blood and walking sideways the next day and all the wounds on his face which another film would miraculously clean up remain with him a third of the way into the movie. This life is not easy. Even when its going well its harsh and mean -- and for Billy things dont go well for long. ""Southpaw"" goes beyond the specifics of boxing and becomes a universal story about tragedy and grief. Theres a fairly early scene in which someone is shot something that happens in movies all the time except that this scene is agonizing one of the most agonizing of its kind that you will ever see. It reverberates through the film as it haunts the lives of its victims and the movie never shakes it off. Like the wounds that cant heal in a day it becomes part of the overall mood of struggle and despair. Forget boxing. ""Southpaw"" delves into what happens when a person loses everything. An instinctive man Billy does things in response that might not make sense to most people. But Jake Gyllenhaal finds the emotional through line in Sutters script showing us someone who wants to feel pain wants to be pummeled wants to die and wants to fight the world. Its one of the great performances of a man being eaten up inside and yet its full of gentle unexpected touches such as the helpless look of love that crosses his face when Billy sees his daughter. Success provides a person with a world of shiny surfaces while grief grants us X-ray vision into the pain of others. Among the fascinating elements of ""Southpaw"" is that we know almost nothing about Billys fight trainer but as played by Forest Whitaker we see and understand a depth of suffering thats in harmony with Billys own and with the movies truth. In ""Southpaw"" the characters such as Billys manager (50 Cent) who believe in money and power and success are walking in darkness and chasing a flashlight. Billy is also in the dark but he knows it and that gives him a fighting chance. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Director Antoine Fuqua (203). R Violence language sexuality. Area theaters. When boxing cliches work they can deliver a knockout. When they dont as in ""Southpaw"" we get just punch-drunk. Its all here press-conference taunts a fall from grace shifty promoters a grouchy trainer the attempt to pull our heartstrings. The first three ""Rocky"" movies and both versions of ""The Champ"" combined would have a hard time knocking down all the banalities in the screenplay by ""Sons of Anarchy"" creator Kurt Sutter. Billy ""The Great"" Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) -- hows that for a nickname? -- is an undefeated champ with a hot wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) an adorable kid and a huge Jersey mansion. Billy and Maureen both were raised in a Hells Kitchen orphanage (a phrase that evokes Depression-era fighters). Billys light-heavyweight championship belt is protected by easy matchups. Then a mouthy contender Ramone (Victor Ortiz) mocks Billy at a press conference and insults Maureen. At a charity event one of Ramones crew causes a scuffle a gun goes off and -- this isnt a spoiler its in the trailer -- Maureen dies. Billys shifty manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson doing a fine job) leaves and Billy has to sell the mansion and auction off his belongings. Billys need to bury his grief in alcohol causes him to lose custody of his daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) to a family services center. To prove to the courts hes stable Billy gets a job cleaning a grubby uptown gym. The gyms owner Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) reluctantly agrees to train Billy despite Ticks assertion that he ""doesnt train pro fighters."" But after a few more hardships and a few more montages guess what? Tick changes his mind and Billy battles Ramone in the ring. Sutter and director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") never met a boxing banality they didnt like. But Gyllenhaal again willing to transform for a role tries to triumph against the most pedantic moments. Last year Gyllenhaal went creepy for ""Nightcrawler"" after getting twitchy for ""Prisoners."" Heres hes impressively ripped as if physical strength would help him find some truth. Whitaker on the other hand benefits from recognizing the movies cartoon aspects (which include McAdams need to cram 15 rounds of acting into a very brief time). The Oscar-winning actor who does more in a glance or a shrug than many actors can with a soliloquy lets this bilious movie relax around him. Like the left-handed punch Tick teaches Billy to save up for the right moment Whitaker makes the movie bounce back a bit. As the ringside announcers might say bombastically in ""Southpaw"" a great trainer can make a difference. What he cant do though is turn a movie this stitched together into a knockout. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

"Review Southpaw saved from TKO by Oscar-worthy acting - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Southpaw saved from TKO by Oscar-worthy actingBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 07/22/2015 122817 PM PDTUpdated 07/22/2015 051731 PM PDTRelated StoriesJul 22Southpaw 5 best boxing filmsJul 21Jake Gyllenhaal goes extra yard for Southpaw""Southpaw"" couldve been a contender ... if there were more of an original and worthwhile story to back up some great performances.It has the over-the-top brutality of ""Raging Bull"" without matching Martin Scorseses artistry. It has the heart-tugging qualities of ""The Champ"" only with more predictability. It has a would-be hero we can rally around a la Rocky Balboa except star Jake Gyllenhaals character is not terribly likable during the movies first half.Still the intense raw acting skills of Gyllenhaal and strong performances from Forest Whitaker and young actress Oona Laurence save ""Southpaw"" from getting lost in its cliches. Director Antoine Fuqua gets the most from his talented cast which is fortunate because the violence and despair in the films first hour or so make ""Southpaw"" an often unpleasant ride. But all the hardship does help bring us to the films powerful if predictable ending. (Front L-R) Jake Gyllenhaal as Billy Hope and Curtis 50Cent Jackson as Jordan Mains in Southpaw. (Scott Garfield/The Weinstein Company) ( Scott Garfield/The Weinstein Com ) Gyllenhaal plays light-heavyweight champ Billy ""The Great"" Hope in what could be an Oscar-nominated performance if it were a better film (and its coming well ahead of awards season). The tattooed and battered Hope is more of a gritty puncher than a skilled boxer and though hes a winner he takes tremendous punishment. He lives the good life out of the ring with loving wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) and feisty 10-year-old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). The plot takes a turn toward ""Rocky III"" territory when hes goaded into a confrontation by upstart contender Miquel Escobar (the terribly unlikable Miquel Gomez) and tragedy ensues. Hope becomes unhinged and unable to take care of Leila. He meets a former heavyweight contender and gym owner Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) who begrudgingly agrees to help Hope get his daughter his title and his life back.Advertisement Here is where the movie finds its rhythm from two supporting characters bringing out the best in Gyllenhaals Hope. Laurence shines as a little girl juggling her emotions after having everything ripped away from her. She brings out some much-needed humanity in Hope while Whitakers Willis -- a walking collection of emotional and physical scars -- brings Hope ... hope as a father figure who comes to believe in the embattled boxer.Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson is solid as Hopes former manager Jordan Mains who ditches the former champ as soon as Hope runs out of money. Of course its Mains idea to stage the obligatory revenge match that leads to the even-more-obligatory montage of fight-training scenes (which thankfully doesnt carry on too long). Whats different is that while the boxing action is necessarily over the top (no real boxer could withstand the trumped-up punishment they show in boxing movies) ""Southpaw"" shows Willis teaching Hope that the sport is really about defense and outthinking your opponent. The final confrontation still has plenty of blood and slow-motion pounding but it earns points for showing strategy and being closer to reality than most boxing films.Gyllenhaal -- whose body and technical transformation for ""Southpaw"" is seriously impressive -- shows he has become the kind of actor who can carry a film. His skills and the performances by Whitaker and Laurence make up for the cliches and plot ""twists"" that you can see coming for miles. An original story worthy of its actors performances couldve made ""Southpaw"" a real champ.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.Southpaw   1/2Rating R (for language throughout and some violence)Cast Jake Gyllenhaal Forest Whitaker Rachel McAdams Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson Oona LaurenceDirector Antoine FuquaRunning time 2 hours 3 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The astonishing rise of Jake Gyllenhaal from likeable nice guy in easy Hollywood comedies to formidable dramatic force with range and versatility in bold powerful dramas that flex his muscles and test his endurance continues in Southpaw a familiar tale about a boxing champion who loses everything and punches his way back to glory and redemption through the school of hard knocks in and out of the ring. Weve seen it many times before in everything from Champion to Requiem for a Heavyweight but what makes this one different is the dedication commitment and sincerity the star brings to every aspect of the role. This is a pugilist with a heart. SOUTHPAW 1/2 (3.5/4 stars) Written by Kurt Sutter Directed by Antoine Fuqua Starring Rachel McAdams Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker Running time 123 min. Billy Hope is a rags-to-riches hero raised in an orphanage in Hells Kitchen who fought his way from poverty to undefeated light heavyweight champion of the world. Beloved by fans and sports journalists alike envied by his foes and staunchly supported by his proud worshipful daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) and smart beautiful and loyal wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) who shares the same background (they were both in the same orphanage as kids) Billys is the kind of American success story that makes great movie fiction. Billy has everything--cars a lavish mansion love--but even when the film opens with another pulverizing knockout in Madison Square Garden only a few blocks away from the orphanage where he grew up Maureen shows her worry about where his aggressive two-fisted fighting technique (or lack of one) will lead if he doesnt get out of the fight game before he is permanently damaged by the endless blows he endures in the ring. The more he gets hit the harder he fights and Maureen fears if he continues to get battered hell end up punch drunk in two years. So hes on his way to an early retirement when fate deals a fatal right cross that stops him in his tracks. Tragedy strikes early when at a gala charity fundraiser ball an unexpected melee with fiery resentful opponent Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) results in violence random shots ring out and Maureen is accidentally killed in the crossfire. Devastated and despondent Billy never recovers but dropping out doesnt seem to be an option. The dead-end sadness of the fight game is that once a champion you have to spend the rest of your career defending your title. So when the money runs out Billy has to return to the ring to pay the bills. The physical toll it takes is ruinous and Billys downfall is swift. Even though we know the blows are fake and the punches are choreographed the beatings are still horrible to watch. Even his closest advisors fall away when he loses his title. In debt and under suspension for slugging a referee the court remands his daughter to child services hes ordered to attend sobriety and anger management classes his house is foreclosed and his possessions go to auction. Billy hits rock bottom and the rest of the movie follows him while he valiantly picks up the pieces struggles to make a comeback and fights to regain custody of his daughter with the help of a legendary trainer (Forest Whitaker). The script by Kurt Sutter (Sons of Anarchy) and the gutsy direction by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day) conspire to keep you dazed and repulsed by the bloody action while you reach for a tear-stained Kleenex but it is really the overpowering performance by Mr. Gyllenhaal that keeps Southpaw sparring with the audience. Blending the sensitivity he showed as a gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain with the peculiar oddball distance from reality he displayed in Nightcrawler the star is the centrifugal force that keeps you slack-jawed with admiration. Mentally and physically collapsed yet fired up with the dogged tenacity to start his life over hes vulnerable rough ferocious charismatic and riveting. As boxing movies go Southpaw is bland and doesnt always successfully manage to avoid the pitfalls of the genre. The inevitable final championship bout at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas between Billy and his archenemy Escobar the man responsible for Maureens death is a cliche. Well crafted with blood spraying the screen it explodes with vitality but Mr. Gyllenhaals outcome is all you really care about. Moving effortlessly between big Hollywood movies and modest New York stage vehicles hes turned into quite an actor. Few stars make such concentrated efforts to improve their craft while rising through the ranks of stardom. With cauliflower ears black eyes busted lips and covered with tattoos hes not always as entirely believable in Southpaw as say Robert Ryan in The Set-Up or Anthony Quinn in Requiem for a Heavyweight but he is entirely spellbinding.

His gloves are slipped over the wrappings and then theyre taped on too -- but while his fists may be imprisoned his mind has got to stay quick and free. The fighter is a scrapper from Hells Kitchen -- he came up there presumably in the days when it was still hellish -- with the portentous name Billy Hope and hes played by an ornately tattooed Jake Gyllenhaal whos all skin muscle and eyes. You just know that in the course of the next few hours great and terrible things will happen to Billy. There will be very little in-between.After an initial fleeting moment of triumph the first half of Southpaw charts Billys rapid and painful downward spiral initiated by one horrific incident. His looping free-fall of despair punishing to witness cant end soon enough. But the rest of Southpaw -- which if you havent guessed details Billys clawing his way back to everything that matters to him -- doesnt have enough dramatic spring to win us back. The problem isnt just that Southpaw -- which was written by Kurt Sutter whose previous credits include episodes of The Shield and Sons of Anarchy -- is predictable. Post-Shakespeare plenty of great stories follow a basic template. But Fuqua heaps the movies first half with so much misery that by the time Forest Whitaker shows up as the tough-but-sensitive neighborhood trainer-sensei wholl get the fallen Billy back on track -- come on you knew that was coming -- we already feel beaten to the consistency of hamburger.Film Details Southpaw RatingR GenreDrama Running Time123 min. More Info Trailer That may be more or less true of all of Fuquas movies -- his last was The Equalizer with Denzel Washington as a hardware-store vigilante -- but many of them are still more skillfully balanced than this one is. The pummeling of both the audience and of Billy begins in the fight scene that follows the movies skillful opening. We learn immediately what kind of fighter Billy is the tough guy who likes to prove he can take a punch. Fuqua and cinematographer Mauro Fiore shoot the match unsparingly -- Billy may be sturdy but we feel every bone-crunching blow. Hes a mess by the end dazed and bloodied; he slumps in the dressing room surrounded by damp red towels that used to be white gelatinous strings of crimson saliva hanging from his mouth. EXPAND Photo by Scott Garfield Billys wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) doesnt like what she sees. Shes a ringside goddess with a mass of blond curls given to wearing minidresses with glitzy high-heeled gladiator sandals but shes anything but a heartless tootsie She and Billy have been together for years having grown up in the same Hells Kitchen orphanage. (Theyre like Victorian waifs transplanted into the New York City child welfare system.) And she desperately wants him to take a break from fighting. Maureen is Billys lifeline as well as the mother of the couples much adored daughter Leila (Oona Laurence who bears a striking resemblance to Miracle on 34th Street-era Natalie Wood). She protects him from fair-weather friends and assorted operators including his manager (a slick sleek 50 Cent). Then the worst happens and we find out just how emotionally fragile Billy is. Photo by Scott Garfield Southpaw is an exhausting brutalist melodrama but if nothing else Fuqua always works with fine actors and hes got a passel of them here. McAdams is breezy and believable even in this stock protective-wife role. Naomie Harris and Rita Ora make the best of their smallish parts. Whitaker as a milky-eyed retired pro brings some blessedly laid-back energy to this exceedingly high-strung movie. And Gyllenhaal is good in every scene -- but even he ends up wearing us down. Billy may look like hes all muscle but hes really just a mass of exposed nerves As Gyllenhaal plays him hes hunched and twitchy a sculpted athlete who deep down is too bruised and tender to make his way in the world at large. Its Gyllenhaals job to portray Billy as a walking mess and he takes that mission very seriously -- too seriously. Billys eyes may be hungry and haunted but what shines through them most brightly is Gyllenhaals method determination. He keeps slugging through every minute of Southpaw even after hes already got us on the ropes.Directed by Antoine Fuqua. Written by Kurt Sutter.

Captured in unsettling slo-mo his mouth agape he unleashes a fearsome battlecry and heads straight for the camera. Its a frenetic snapshot of intensity that suggests Edvard Munchs ""The Scream"" in the boxing ring and one of the only times when the movie escapes the boundaries of its formulaic material. In that brief moment it offers a viscerally engaging portrait of masculine belligerence driven to its hardiest extremes. But Gyllenhaals alarmingly effective presence is enough to act circles around the soapy narrative of a fallen athletes comeback so tightly that it crumbles in the very first act. Gyllenhaals distinctive appearance has already proven its capacity to take control of a narrative with mesmerizing results. Last years thrilling bleak tale of a ruthless L.A. paparazzo ""Nightcrawler"" found the actor embodying the role of calculated psychopath with bulging eyes that conveyed intelligence and lunacy in equal measures. That face provided the ideal framework for a story rich with ideas about the dangers of competitive instincts. Whereas ""Nightcrawler"" found them contained in its fearsome anti-heros murky tactics ""Southpaw"" unleashes any semblance of subtext for a brash familiar routine. Though Gyllenhaals smallish frame in ""Nightcrawler"" belied an internal resilience ""Southpaw"" finds him beefed up along with the storys blaring themes of self-determination. As boxing champ Billy Hope Gyllenhaal plays a ferocious stock character in a movie defined by them. The setup is shrill but effective loaded with the stinging tragedy of a Lifetime movie on steroids After another grisly victory match Billy stumbles to his palatial bed still riddled with wounds where his supportive wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) tries to convince him to quit while hes ahead for the sake of their 10-year-old daughter (Oona Laurence). Hes vaguely swayed but its hardly enough before Maureen winds up murdered at a public event celebrating the victory. The death which follows a scuffle between Billy and the gruff fighter Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) sends Billy into a downward spiral of heavy drinking and hard spending. In short order he loses his agent (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) to the competition his house to debt collectors and his daughter to social services. Billys forced to start from scratch and work his way back to the top. Reduced to cleaning the floors at a grimy gym he joins forces with its disgraced trainer (Forest Whitaker) to seek out one last victory. Any doubts whether hell find it? Initially a project designed for Eminem to echo his own career ups and downs as a quasi-sequel to ""8 Mile"" the final version of ""Southpaw"" as directed by Antoine Fuqua -- minus any personal meta ingredients aside from Gyllenhaals developing penchant for creepy roles -- has been reduced to unabashed pulp. Fresh from ""The Equalizer"" Fuqua ostensibly delivers another darkly virile uninspired action movie with the muscular Gyllenhaal intensifying the proceedings whenever he enters the ring. The sappier bits with Billys urgently attempting to reconnect with his daughter and talking through his woes with Whitaker as they exchange sob stories at a local pub hit comparatively hollow notes. Shot in murky gray tones and set to a downbeat score by the late James Horner  ""Southpaw"" offers plenty of sudden jolts as Billys destructive tendencies find him slamming into people and objects alike. But his trajectory unfolds like an overly confident ""Rocky"" rip-off (not the best timing given the continuation of the ""Rocky"" legacy later this year in ""Creed"") with plenty of technical pizzazz but little to make it memorable. Except Gyllenhaals face. While hes certainly no public trainwreck Gyllenhaals filmography has undulated in peculiar ways. Having launched his career with the ambitious mysteries of ""Donnie Darko"" where that same visage pointed to mysteries that defied any precise explanation hes since drifted through a variety of material. Hes flirted with big studio blockbusters (""The Day After Tomorrow"" and the dud ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"") measured character studies (""Brokeback Mountain"" ""Zodiac"") and heavy topical wartime dramas (""Jarhead"" ""Rendition"" ""Brothers""). The results have been wildly mixed occasionally yielding brilliant looks at troubled men rich with the ambiguous expressions of their leading man and sometimes just struggling to keep up with him. ""Southpaw"" sags rather quickly into the latter category but at least doesnt get in the way of its main talent. When Billy gets fired up the movies conventional ingredients give way to an actor in his element. He may not land a winning role each time out but at least hes still in the heat of the ring swinging away. Grade C ""Southpaw"" opens nationwide on Friday.

Reply therese May 12 2016 624 pm When one wants to find positive facts about a film and the only redeeming element is the saro the movie but not the plot the value proposition does not raise to art. Perhaps this film was just a business effort. Reply Mogrill May 12 2016 624 pm Whose career doesnt have undulations? I find that whole section of the review curious. Gyllenhaals career has had far more ups than downs in terms of roles. Box office success has not always followed but is that what youre reviewing? Id say it all adds up to something much more than ""certainly no trainwreck."" Reply Kurt May 12 2016 624 pm Adding to the ""undulating"" further the Gyllenhaal persona actually began with a storybook topline studio example of October Sky thats become a prennial classroom staple. If anything his career could be seen as negotiation between the changing studio system and a millennial slate that ambivalently reflects enumerates on memories of studio eras. Reply Kurt May 12 2016 624 pm Its hard to apply the actor as auteur theory when only the bona fide brand names parlay their influence into the directing editing process and promotion. Gyllenhaal is just finding footing now to be a more proactive auteur of his own performances (where interpretation improvisation change the script a posteriori)  instead of the occasionally amp; curiously maligned ""White male lead-ish in Flux symbiosis with Others"".

Like a Raging Bull thats been clocked one too many times in the head Antoine Fuquas blood-simple boxing melodrama is so loaded with obviousness it gets more pained groans from the audience than the guys in the ring. A movie that makes Rocky and The Fighter feel like models of complexity Southpaw is a redemption story--and lets thank screenwriter Kurt Sutter for including the word redemption more than once in the dialogue. Billy Hope (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an inspiration to fans transcending his tough upbringing in New Yorks Hells Kitchen to claim the light-heavyweight title along with a lovely devoted wife (Rachel McAdams) and luxurious home. Its all quickly taken away from him in the movies Job-like reversal as an accidental gunshot turns Billy into a drug-abusing widower his young daughter placed into protective custody. Will he straighten up via some tough love from a scrappy gym-owning coach (Forest Whitaker) and make a lucrative televised comeback? Viewers who have texting to do wont need to look up. Already Southpaw is being positioned as an awards-worthy plunge into grit from star Jake Gyllenhaal. He has bulked up tremendously and wears the characters grief like a sweaty robe. But compared to his fast flinty turn in last years Nightcrawler this is simple stuff for him suppressing the actors natural craftiness into lugubrious Stallone-isms. The performance is poundingly physical yet its set in a fantasy world where family tensions get resolved quicker than jaws hit the canvas.

Director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Kurt Sutter (""Sons of Anarchy"") employ just about every old-school trick in the book down to the scene where a tearful father and daughter are forcibly separated in family court. If you told me an earlier draft of the script portrayed pugilist hero Billy Hope as a gifted violinist who puts down the fiddle and steps into the ring to pay for an operation for his blind kid sister I wouldnt be surprised. See Video Jake Gyllenhaal Fights to Get Back in the Ring in New Southpaw Trailer (Video) Still cliches can be as fun in a new movie as in an old one and if you come to terms with the fact that ""Southpaw"" doesnt bring any ideas to the canvas that are any newer than Wallace Beery this is an energetic enough fight picture to capture the imagination. It exists mainly to show off Jake Gyllenhaals willingness to cover his ripped weight-trained body with scars and tattoos to prove hes a serious actor. Heres the thing though He shouldnt have to. Anyone whos been paying attention to the actors work for the last decade or so has witnessed an extraordinary variety of complex empathetic performances in films like ""Enemy"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" ""Zodiac"" ""End of Watch"" ""Source Code"" ""Prisoners"" and last years creepy riveting ""Nightcrawler."" Like so many attractive peers of both sexes however Gyllenhaal knows that the only way he gets to be a player in awards season is by obscuring his good looks and mortifying the flesh. Someday an underwear model will cop an Oscar for performing Hamlet while covered in horse dung and carrying an anvil. Billy Hope makes a fine addition to Gyllenhaals gallery but its only in the externals that the work is leaps and bounds beyond his best recent turns. Where Gyllenhaals -- as well as Fuquas and Sutters -- abilities stand out is in demonstrating to us how Billy changes as a boxer over the course of the film; the fighter we meet at the beginning is not the one we see at the end and ""Southpaw"" takes us through that process and lets even those of us unstudied in the Sweet Science take in Billys evolution. When the film opens Billy is riding high with a champion belt. Hes risen from tough circumstances -- sportscasters of the opening brawl mention twice that Billy and his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) were raised in Hells Kitchen orphanages -- and now hes living the good life. Tragedy strikes and Billy falls apart physically and emotionally and he loses everything from the house and the cars to custody of his adorable bespectacled daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). Also Read Forest Whitaker in Talks to Join Star Wars Rogue One Remake of The Crow Will a humbled Billy start again from the bottom work hard under the unforgiving tutelage of his trainer Tick (Forest Whitaker) and eventually get the chance to regain the belt by going the distance in a grudge match against a rival boxer now handled by Billys corrupt former manager Jordan (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson)? You bet your sweet training montage he will. Fuqua and cinematographer Mauro Fiore (""Avatar"") dont even attempt to get in the ring with ""Rocky"" much less ""Raging Bull"" so the matches are shot journalistically in the bright flat lighting familiar to anyone whos ever watched a bout on HBO. Its editor John Refoua (""The Equalizer"") who shines here keeping the boxing sequences taut and suspenseful as the camera catches every drop of Billys literal sweat and blood. Also Read Eminem Releases Phenomenal Single Off of Southpaw Soundtrack (Audio) Gyllenhaal McAdams and Laurence create a believable family dynamic and Whitaker cant help but be powerful in a role that has to be as automatic as shoelace-tying for the veteran actor by this point. Jackson radiates untrustworthiness but unfortunately he does so from the moment he walks on screen which is way before his cue and its too bad that the talented Naomie Harris (""Skyfall"") doesnt get more to do as Leilas social worker. ""Southpaw"" is so simultaneously entertaining and unsurprising that it could go straight to ESPN Classic but if these are the extremes it takes for certain people to notice that hey that guy from ""Bubble Boy"" has turned into a heck of an actor then so be it.

TWITTER Director Antoine Fuqua gives Jake Gyllenhaal a macho makeover in this tale of a broken prize-fighter. A taut boxing yarn about a champ who loses it all and has to fight his way back to keep custody of his daughter Southpaw sticks to tried-and-tested genre rules yet an edgy cast -- led by formidable leading man Jake Gyllenhaal -- keeps the story in sharp focus. Director Antoine Fuqua has shown his talent for bringing out the shadowy side of nice guys like Denzel Washington in The Equalizer and Training Day. Here Gyllenhaal gets the makeover as a bloodied battered but magnetic prize-fighter. Set for a late July release after its competition bow at the Shanghai Film Festival it has the chops to draw the high-testosterone male demographic but feels too macho-centric to cross over to the Million Dollar Baby crowd. An award-worthy Gyllenhaal is the main attraction. The role of light heavyweight champion Billy Hope was originally to be Eminems but after he decided to ankle the project to concentrate on his music Gyllenhaal climbed over the ropes. Though the tenderly handsome Nightcrawler star naturally looks about as much of a boxer as baby-faced Alain Delon in Rocco and His Brothers -- which is to say not at all -- here the former Donnie Darko has been transformed into a tattooed muscle-bound raging bull gladiator. Its even hard to recognize him in the opening shots which emphasize Billys blood-soaked face and wild roar as he thunders at his opponent in Madison Square Garden delivering the winning blows that make him world champ. Back in the locker room his sexy wife Maureen (a well-cast Rachel McAdams) looks on in pride and trepidation as the doctors sew his face back on and save his left eye. She wants him to quit while he still has a face but then who would pay for their extravagant lifestyle and New York manse? Still her concern for him seems genuine and their public affection signals how much in love they are. Making their happiness complete is their chipper 11-year-old daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) who adores them both evolving into a central character as the film goes on. Read more Shanghai Film Festival Mike Tyson Donnie Yen Face Off on the Red Carpet Strutting posturing dazed-eyed Billy would make a caveman look non-aggressive and being at the top of his game in the opening scene hes clearly cruising for a come-down. Maureen takes the first hit. Spoiler alert Shes only around for the first half-hour before becoming the tragic consequence of a ferocious fist-fight between Billy and brash young contender Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez) who wants his title. But McAdams leaves behind the memory of a strong woman who has climbed up from the projects at her mans side a savvy manager and a loving wife and mother caught up in the contradictions of being married to a violent prize-fighter. Billy shows the same kind of see-sawing ambiguity in his fighting. On the one hand hes an unchained beast in the ring whose only instinct is to attack; on the other his wifes departure forces him to learn anger management as well as how to put up his dukes and defend himself. After his life quickly -- too quickly to be believable -- crumbles around him the second act slows down for some growing-up time away from the ring. Even boxings heights are portrayed as toxic with suave money-grabbing fight organizers like the one played by Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson having no qualms about turning a non-genius like Billy into putty in their greedy hands. The legal system seems equally cold and unjust in taking Leila away from him though it also motivates him to mature into a responsible dad. Read more Hear Eminems Bold Southpaw Track ""Phenomenal"" Theres nothing truly out-of-the-box in the competent first screenplay by Sons of Anarchy creator Kurt Sutter which eventually trots out Forest Whitaker in the role of the gruff retired master trainer with a heart-of-gold Tick Wills. After a suitable period of courtship during which time Tick blows off Billy and insists he doesnt train professionals the two predictably pair off to prep for Billys big comeback fight for the world title in Vegas. Again hats off to the actors and editor John Refoua who make this old chicken soup exciting to watch. Mauro Fiores cinematography favors a shadowy black-on-black look that highlights only key parts of faces and the set. The action scenes are pumped up and the emotional time-outs smoothed over softly with James Horners score that ranges from moody to rap.

You can practically smell the blood the sweat and the fierce actorly commitment rising from Jake Gyllenhaals bruised and tattooed body in ""Southpaw"" a bluntly conventional melodrama about a champion boxer forced to undergo a grim crucible of physical emotional and spiritual suffering. Yet the undeniable intensity of Gyllenhaals bulked-up Method-mumbling performance may leave you feeling more pummeled than convinced in this heavy-handed tale of redemption in which director Antoine Fuqua once more demonstrates his fascination with codes of masculine aggression extreme violence and not much else. Creakily plotted over the course of its rise-and-fall-and-rise-again trajectory this partly Chinese-funded production may land enough visceral blows to catch on with audiences on its July 24 release through the Weinstein Co. but seems less likely to attain the prestige-hit status of superior efforts like ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Fighter."" That didnt stop exec producer Harvey Weinstein from loudly speculating at a recent Cannes sneak-peek screening that Gyllenhaal would receive an Oscar nomination for his arresting transformation here partly as ""revenge"" for his perceived snub in the best actor race for last years ""Nightcrawler."" A master awards strategist like Weinstein certainly knows of what he speaks though in this case his words tell us less about the quality of Gyllenhaals performance than they do about the corruption of a system that favors big showy stunt acting above all else and that too often hands out acting awards for reasons that are compensatory rather than merit-based. ""Revenge"" meanwhile is a particularly ironic word choice for this particular story which puts our hero on a collision course with the man who may have cost him everything and rather shamelessly stokes his appetite for retribution and ours. A rough-around-the-edges type who emerged from a life of Hells Kitchen foster homes and jail cells to achieve major success in the ring light heavyweight boxing champ Billy ""the Great"" Hope (Gyllenhaal) seems to have everything living a life of luxury with a wife he adores Maureen (a strong Rachel McAdams) and their precocious young daughter Leila (Oona Laurence). But fame comes with the usual pitfalls and Maureen wants her husband to take a break not only so he can spend more time with his family but also because she fears that his ferocious no-holds-barred boxing style will get him seriously injured or worse. Naturally its Maureen who will pay the ultimate price for her perceptiveness succumbing to an accidental gunshot wound after Billy has a violent confrontation with a trash-talking rival Miguel Escobar (Miguel Gomez). Reeling from this senseless tragedy Billy quickly descends into a spiral of anger despair substance abuse poverty and violence and winds up losing his house his longtime manager (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) and worst of all Leila whos placed in the care of family services. Determined to win back custody of his daughter and gradually revive his boxing career he takes a menial job cleaning toilets at a rundown boxing gym owned by Tick Willis (Forest Whitaker) who reluctantly agrees to oversee Billys training despite his distaste for the world of professional boxing. The sort of tough-love mentor who forbids drinking and swearing in his gym (yet is not immune to either vice) Tick takes a higher-minded view of the sport giving Billy the sort of athletic education that prioritizes technique discipline and confidence over anger retaliation and brute force. Particularly during the films first half Fuqua deploys such a heavy directorial hand that he all but puts a chokehold on the material; he doesnt seem to be observing Billys decline so much as actively trying to break his spirit as though having the character hit rock bottom numerous times would encourage our empathy rather than leave us feeling crudely manipulated. Fortunately despite a third-act finale that all too conveniently allows Billy to settle his score with fate ""Southpaw"" largely avoids devolving into a sort of pugilistic ""Death Wish"" (which comes as something of a relief given the over-the-top Grand Guignol payback in the helmers previous outing ""The Equalizer""). The boxing scenes themselves are dynamically lensed and cut (by d.p. Mauro Fiore and editor John Refoua respectively) and Fuqua (a boxer himself) favors a wide array of camera angles -- sometimes adopting the up-close perspective of Billys opponent sometimes taking a ringside seat yet always seeking to position the viewer in the midst of a gaudy tawdry pulse-pounding spectacle. At the same time the filmmakers seem well aware that nothing they show us can really rival the spectacle of Gyllenhaal himself who throws himself into the role of Billy Hope with the sort of go-for-broke abandon that makes even his creepy gollum-like turn in last years ""Nightcrawler"" look like a drama-class exercise by comparison. Having shed 15 pounds (and seemingly a few IQ points) for the part Gyllenhaal has never looked rougher or tougher onscreen; with his closely cropped hair his swollen face his perpetually bloodied left eye his skin drawn tautly across his muscles hes virtually unrecognizable here which for some will be more than enough to satisfy the expectations of a truly great performance. Strangest of all is the actors voice which sounds as though its dropped at least an octave and his decision to speak in rumbling inarticulate half-sentences with almost every other word an expletive. Its a solid if strenuous piece of acting one that never lets us forget every ounce of effort that went into achieving it. Gyllenhaal has a handful of sturdy moments with Whitaker who makes a fine foil in the role of the gruff old trainer but the star has more difficulty establishing a credible father-daughter rapport with Laurence. As she demonstrated recently in Ross Partridges indie drama ""Lamb"" Laurence is one of the years more remarkable child-acting discoveries but she has little opportunity to show what shes capable of here largely because the movie forces Leila to lash out at her deadbeat dad in ways that feel more dramatically expedient than psychologically persuasive. Perhaps the central failing of this first feature screenplay by Kurt Sutter (""The Shield"" ""Sons of Anarchy"") is that it never gets beyond its protagonists simplistic worldview treating Leila more or less as a prop to be brought in and stir up periodic conflict and likewise reducing the figure of Miguel to a one-dimensional villain. A callous subplot involving an at-risk teenager at Ticks gym strikes a particularly misguided note. Production designer Derek R. Hills sets are convincingly inhabited and the film makes effective use of Pennsylvania locations to capture the lavish and squalid extremes of Billys lifestyle (with boxing-match detours to Madison Square Garden and Caesars Palace in Las Vegas). James Horners synth score adds to the films brooding tenor while the soundtrack was produced by Eminem who was once floated as a possibility to play Billy Hope and who might well have done more with the role -- which is to say less.

Babette Ward says November 14 2015 at 817 pm I never read ""professional reviews"" before I see a movie. If I relied on these ""professional"" opinions I would miss out on some really great movies. Reply Babette Ward says November 14 2015 at 810 pm I thought this was a good movie with a GREAT performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. I hope he does get an Oscar. I loved his performance. Im not a fan of any actor in particular but this is my favorite performance by Gyllenhaal of all the movies Ive seen him in. I had not paid attention to the movie previews so I didnt expect what happened to his wife at all. Im not a boxing movie fan so I never intended to watch this movie. The plot was somewhat predictable but it was still an emotional and entertaining movie from me. Reply Donna Francis says November 9 2015 at 211 pm This is the best movie I have watched in the last 10 years. I actually quit going to the movies because the last couple years their not worth the money to see. Jake Gyllenhaal deserves an academy award for his performance and Rachael McAdams gave a wonderful performance also. I watched the movie 3 times and called my sons and told them they had to see it. Reply c says October 18 2015 at 547 pm I already knew this movie was shit before I read this review. But its still fun to hear people complaining about it and even more fun to see the chumps that excitedly coughed up 12 bucks to see it in theaters call the reviewer ""jealous."" I advise those bitter fans of this movie (which I will refer to as ""Lefthand"") to keep searching google until they find a positive review so they will feel better. Good luck with that crap. Reply clmyrus says September 27 2015 at 1214 am ""I dont know him anymore..."" after being ripped apart from the only parent she loved thats left???? WTF I should be producer of this SHIT film Reply thebaltimoron says September 15 2015 at 705 pm This movie was terrible. Reply Richiepooh says September 11 2015 at 222 pm Not the best review but then not much good to say about the film...Chang done the best he can with what he had to work with. Positive comments are hard to find in this bile. Reply tom says August 29 2015 at 150 pm Please stop doing reviews. Thank you. Reply toni says August 3 2015 at 550 pm Had to add. As a woman I saw a lot of things about the relationships going on. The final scene where the other boxer tried to push Jake that rage came out totally. Just like his daughters anger. I have seen that before. I also felt Forest w. I plan to see it again to review Jake and wife dynamics. Together they all made this film pop Reply toni says August 3 2015 at 536 pm Loved it Everyone brought the film to life. And the music got me totally caught up. That last song tipped it way over in the positive Reply nyfilmguy says July 26 2015 at 852 pm Spot on review. Hard to get excited about being fed a formulaic film like this let alone about JGs adequate but over-hyped efforts. Reply David Perez says July 25 2015 at 356 pm To the reviewer I have not seen the movie yet I definitely will thanks to your MORONIC review. How about being impartial for starters.How did you get your job anyway? The people posting comments on your stupid review have better skills than you Reply mrsmarisolriddell says July 22 2015 at 522 am I could not help but feel slightly embarrassed for this reviewer. He seems to have an almost personal disdain for Jake Gyllenhall that borders on jealousy. Reading it made me feel a little like I was watching Michael Scott(Steve Carell) on The Office during a particularly flinch worthy scene... you know where it hurt to watch because you were so embarrassed for him. Reply southpaw says July 10 2015 at 537 pm SERIOUSLY FIRE THIS IDIOT. come on i can write abusive shit and call it a review FIRE THIS MORON. DISGUSTING wont buy or subscribe until idiots like this are not reviewing for you also SPOILER ALERT would have been nice MORON just listed the ENTIRE PLOT... FIRE THE IDIOT WHO WROTE THIS Reply KD. says June 18 2015 at 203 am To add a lot of the descriptions here evoke another contempo stylizing of old-fashioned melodrama La Mome. Stock characters inorganic conflict as plot device. Cotillard in her geriatric scene was also a grand spectacle stylized and strenuously suffering through her body and long-gone mind. What the review jeers at as failings are staples of this very archaic tradition of grand-style melodrama (think writhing chest-heaving visceral emphasis.) Reply KD. says June 18 2015 at 112 am ""last years ""Nightcrawler"" look like a drama-class exercise"" = If this refers to scenes where he came across a total amateur namely his long monologue in the TV station (owned by the Church of Scientology in real life)...The context was precisely his selling himself to her as a naive newbie with harmless aspirations. It was a key scene for beginning her ""mentorship"" of him. So disarmed she had no idea it would go so awry with tables completely turned. Reply KD. says June 18 2015 at 1239 am ""Shed...a few IQ points... rumbling inarticulate ...strenuous"" = Is this the movies shorthand for boxers brain damage from his fighting style? ""One that never lets us forget every ounce of effort that went into achieving it."" = Effortless machismo indeed gets crix love unless its the spiritually suffering women in a Bergman movie Reply John Mullins says June 17 2015 at 313 pm Im no film reviewer but it seems like poor journalism to declare your agenda in the first paragraph of a review- ""...in which director Antoine Fuqua once more demonstrates his fascination with codes of masculine aggression extreme violence and not much else."" Maybe just reviewing the film for what it is might be better? Reply My Jurassic Pants says June 17 2015 at 942 am No boxers body has ever looked like Gyllenhaals in this film. This is a shallow vanity project for all involved and wont even make a blip at the box-office with all of the other big films yet to come this summer. I also cant imagine a woman wanting to see this film as the trailer had to be the ugliest-looking film Ive ever seen. I think they may have broken the ""add grain"" filter in post Reply Al Swearengen says June 17 2015 at 1103 am There are boxers who look like that Timothy Bradley Jr is crazy jacked. Reply SonOfTheYellowKing says June 17 2015 at 920 am IS JAKE ALL NATURAL??? Reply Mantle Head says June 17 2015 at 737 am Its a good twist on the genre to have the wife shot dead by association but the critic is right about the rest. Have no interest to watch a boxer spiral in despair over and then bash someone up. Its a mesh doesnt work the trailer tells me that. Gyllenhaal deserves better than a boxing melodrama... I was surprised he did this film the script is hokey and pulls its emotional punches. Reply Scarlett says June 17 2015 at 645 am So not a Gyllenhaal fan huh? Reply George Valentin says June 17 2015 at 441 am I hope Harvey Weinstein is correct with his prediction of Jake Gyllenhaal being nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. Reply Oxana says June 17 2015 at 433 am ""Having shed 15 pounds (and seemingly a few IQ points) for the part"" Mistake. He GAINED 15 pounds after hed lost 30 pounds for Nightcrawler Reply James says June 17 2015 at 340 am Frustrating that this Is so anti-gyllenhaal on a personal level Reply braiden bowls says June 17 2015 at 331 am This might be the most ridiculous film review Ive read this year. Sounds like the critic had a bad day. Shame. Reply Jake says June 17 2015 at 303 am Lmao. This review is amazing. Reply we see you says June 18 2015 at 235 am Hi JJJ JJJ PPP.
