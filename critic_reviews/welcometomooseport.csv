Despite fine cast headed by Gene Hackman and Ray Romano Fox release lacks the antic energy and imagination that might have put this over as a sharp-witted community comedy. Prospects look mild the wild card being the untested B.O. draw repped by TV star Romano. The most popular president in U.S. history meets his political match in ""Welcome to Mooseport"" a high-concept small-town comedy long on running time and short on real laughs. Despite a fine cast headed by Gene Hackman as the recently retired prez and Ray Romano as an ordinary hardware store owner who runs against him for mayor of a coastal Maine burg Fox release lacks the antic energy and inspired imagination that might have put this over as a sharp-witted community comedy in the Preston Sturges vein. Commercial prospects look mild the wild card being the untested B.O. draw repped by TV star Romano. Substantial mirth seems promised by the prospect of Hackman playing Monroe ""Eagle"" Cole who has just left the oval office after two massively successful terms and now brings his swelled head to Mooseport where he has previously summered. Accompanied by his efficient and adoring personal secretary Grace (Marcia Gay Harden) press secretary Bullard (Fred Savage) and a regiment of self-serious security personnel and flunkies Cole looks forward to lounging around reading the paper while fielding multi-million-dollar offers for speaking engagements memoirs and car commercials. The city fathers have other ideas Mooseports mayor just died and Cole is encouraged to run for the post. Imagining his obligations as largely ceremonial and spurred by the belief that his financially voracious ex-wife Charlotte (Christine Baranski) wont be able to lay claim to the seaside house if its an official residence Cole decides to run. But Cole who was the first president to be divorced while occupying the White House sparks an unanticipated electoral race when he asks out attractive local veterinarian Sally (Maura Tierney) the longtime but currently fed up girlfriend of Handy Harrison the hardware man (Romano). Seized by mild-mannered jealousy Handy jumps into the mayors race too going so far as to begin campaigning at the very restaurant where Cole and Sally are having their first date an event being recorded in every detail as a national news event. As the stakes are upped for both political and personal reasons (Coles fees will allegedly plummet if he loses his first race to a nonentity) Cole calls in his crafty old campaign manager (Rip Torn) who begins applying big-time strategies to the municipal race; one of the few hearty laughs stems from Cole asking how big the sampling was for some downbeat polling statistics only to be told it was the whole town. The candidates hold two debates and engage in a one-on-one golf match to determine who will get Sally; latter contest exposes how much the ex-prezs golf scores had been improved by his staff who hide in the trees and underbrush and throw balls out into the fairway when they go off-course. To be sure the women have something to say about how things turn out; drunkenly bonding in the clubhouse while the guys play their round Sally and Grace seem to inspire in one another the gumption to deliver ultimatums to their less than attentive men. Indeed a certain unease lurks around the edges of the would-be romantic relationships penned by Tom Schulman from Doug Richardsons story. Sally is frustrated over having waited for six years for Handy to commit and it doesnt take long to feel that she is right to look for greener pastures elsewhere so lacking in amorous gumption is Handy. But however alluring a popular ex-president may be Cole is in his early 70s and it would take some deeper character analysis to convince that Sally might actually consider him as a legitimate candidate for her attentions. In almost all respects ""Welcome to Mooseport"" lacks the sort of spirit sharpness and impudent sense of fun to fulfill the promise of the premise. The small town (actually filmed in Toronto and Port Perry Canada) is presented only in generic ways the supporting cast beyond the Hollywood names is thin and any attempt at pointed political humor other than making wan and repetitive fun of Coles entourage is avoided. Even Hackman who would seem born to play such a role lacks that extra spring in his step and undercurrent of maliciousness that mark his best performances which is not to the credit of director Donald Petrie. Romano in his first bigscreen starring role (he scored strongly as the voice of the mammoth in the animated ""Ice Age"" and was part of the ensemble cast in the Sundance entry ""Eulogy"") uses the sharp timing and deadpan underplaying familiar from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" to good effect but isnt challenged to deliver anything new. Tierney Harden Baranski and Torn deliver in pro form. Lensing is blah other tech contributions routine.

Starring Gene Hackman Ray Romano Marcia Gay Harden and Maura Tierney. Directed by Donald Petrie. Written by Tom Schulman. (PG-13. 111 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Bringing out a political comedy in the midst of a political season makes perfect sense. But its timing is the only logical part of ""Welcome to Mooseport"" whose preposterous plot supposes that a beloved two-term president would run again -- this time as mayor of the small town hes retired to. His opponent is a bumbling innocent nicknamed Handy because he owns the local hardware store and has never met a toilet he couldnt fix. The only thing hes ever run for before is a plunger. Yet the race becomes extremely close prompting the ex-president (given the highfalutin nickname Eagle) to spend millions on TV ads. Since Mooseport Maine appears to have about 1000 habitants wouldnt it be cheaper and more effective for Eagle to go door to door? ""Welcome to Mooseport"" is saved by the welcome sight of Gene Hackman as the former commander-in-chief. Hackman has become Hollywoods equivalent of Brahms always dependable. Like Robert De Niro hes turned to comedies in recent years but these screen masters take being funny seriously. Hackman never stops working at creating a plausibly implausible character smirking at his lowly competitor (played by Ray Romano) while charming his would-be constituency. Hackmans Eagle is puffed up with his own importance a man who honestly believes his golf handicap to be 10 oblivious to the fact that a hefty contingent of his people follow him on to the course and throw his errant balls back onto the fairway. In forced retirement Eagle looks to his aides for reassurance that hes being paid more for speaking engagements and receiving a larger book advance than Bill Clinton. Most important his presidential library must be bigger than Clintons. One of the movies successful running jokes is that the money Eagle sinks into his mayoral race comes out of the library reducing it from a palatial elaborate complex to a single building -- to the consternation of an I.M. Pei-like architect last seen sobbing over his decimated model. Handy isnt the only one to be tested in this movie. Its Romanos first major film role raising the question whether the star of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" can make the transition from TV or -- as a critic once said of David Caruso -- whether he has a ""small television face"" incapable of holding the big screen. Theres no denying Romanos funnyman credentials. He has one of those high-pitched voices that make you smile and happens to mesh perfectly with Handys personality. But the jury is still out on Romanos future in movies. Hackman blows him off the screen. Their mayoral debate is like pitting Clinton against Frank Jordan. (On the other hand Romano an accomplished golfer bests Hackman on the tee.) Romano is unconvincing in his romantic scenes with the appealing Maura Tierney as his long-suffering girlfriend who welcomes the attentions of an ex- president. The press tags along on her first date with Eagle. When she turns her head to avoid his kiss the gesture is diagrammed on TV like an analysis of a football play. Adam Sandlers onscreen romancing of actresses as diverse as Drew Barrymore and Emily Watson seems believable but the equally hangdog Romano has a hard time portraying himself as anyones lover. Its telling that Romanos best moment comes when a TV camera captures Handy. His girlfriend intently watches him on television where we are accustomed to seeing him. ""Welcome to Mooseport"" benefits from a certain attention to political details even as theyre applied to a nonsensical situation. Eagle is accompanied everywhere by two black SUVs and a staff of attentive lackeys who anticipate his every move like subservient butlers. But Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden is wasted in the poorly developed role of his closest adviser whose affection for him is obvious to everyone except the big man. Checking the credits of ""Mooseport"" director Donald Petrie and screenwriter Ron Schulman reveals a lot about the uneven nature of their creation. Petrie made ""Grumpy Old Men"" which appealed to the same older audience ""Welcome to Mooseport"" apparently is going after. The humor in these movies is best described as safe. Both films suffer from a flatness and uneven pacing that make them slow going. They have none of the spark Petrie exhibited in ""Mystic Pizza"" and ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" Schulmans record is even spottier ranging from his Academy Award-winning screenplay for ""Dead Poets Society"" to ""8 Heads in a Duffel Bag"" one of the least funny movies ever written. ""Welcome to Mooseport"" ends like a Shakespearean comedy with the couples who are supposed to be together fulfilling their fate. As for the outcome of the mayoral race lets say for now that the best man wins.

Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- The new feature film ""Welcome to Mooseport"" is just too cute for its own good. To begin with everything in Mooseport is so-o-o-o-o-o-o quaint. Theres quaint architecture. A quaint little park. A quaint gazebo. Lots of quaint characters right out of central casting. And even a quaint moose wandering the quaint streets. Its enough to make you wanna gag -- in a quaint kind of way of course. This film is Ray Romanos live-action debut (he provided the voice of Manny in the animated comedy ""Ice Age""). Romano is a likable character who essentially plays himself on his hit sitcom ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and he does it again with ""Welcome to Mooseport."" Unfortunately the script by Tom Schulman (who won an Academy Award for writing ""Dead Poets Society"") is at best a mildly amusing made-for-TV movie. Tickets should come with a frozen dinner. The movies saving grace is that Romano is surrounded by some first-rate actors. When watching two-time Academy Award winner Gene Hackman or Oscar winner Marcia Gay Harden or veteran character actor Rip Torn do their stuff you forget for minutes at a time that this is a really bad movie. Then out of the blue comes some inane stupid one-liner or a ridiculous situation and youre jolted out the moment and reminded that not even great acting can save an idiotic script. Hackman plays Monroe ""Eagle"" Cole an extremely popular former president who is going through a nasty divorce from his vindictive wife Charlotte played by an hysterical over-the-top Christine Baranski. Hes given her their main house and is moving to his summer residence in Mooseport Maine where he plans to write his memoirs. Then hes asked by the good people of Mooseport to run for mayor since their current mayor dropped dead right before the election. Unbeknownst to Cole a popular hometown guy -- and owner of the local hardware store -- ""Handy"" Harrison (Romano) is also running. (Yes hes a handyman named Handy. Isnt that just so -- well -- quaint?) But Handy has more problems on his hands than running for mayor. His longtime girlfriend Sally a local veterinarian (Maura Tierney best known for TV roles in ""ER"" and ""NewsRadio"") is running out of patience and wondering when Handy is going to pop the question. When the newly single ex-president asks her out for a date she accepts in order to make Handy jealous. However the president is equally clueless about his own love life. His longtime assistant Grace Sutherland (Harden) has been in love with him for years and he hasnt got a clue. Not even when she moves to Maine with him. As the two men face off over politics and Sallys affections what had begun as a friendly run for a political office in a backwater town becomes a national event. Cole is in trouble. If he wins it looks like hes beating up on a civilian unfamiliar with the world of politics. If he loses hes a joke for losing to a civilian unfamiliar with the world of politics. Eventually the two men hold nationally televised () debates as they slug it out for a job neither of them really want. The debates are followed by one unfunny situation after another as Cole tries to save his presidential legacy and Handy fights for the woman he loves.

"Unfunny Romano wears out this Welcome - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Unfunny Romano wears out this Welcome By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 20 2004 Right off the bat ""Welcome to Mooseport"" strains credulity by asking us to believe Gene Hackman could play a US president leaving office as the most popular chief executive in history. Now the actors a national treasure and all that but seriously -- hasnt anyone seen the mans movies? You dont go to Gene Hackman looking to entrust him with the countrys well-being; you go to see charming variations on sleaziness. Hes our primary exponent of the moral slide.""Mooseport"" eventually gives him something to work with but not nearly enough Its a disappointingly limp small-town farce played several shades too broadly by a cast that has done better work elsewhere. Hackmans character ex-president Monroe ""Eagle"" Cole retires to the small Maine burg of the title and quickly finds himself tapped by the town elders to replace the recently deceased mayor. Given his plans for speaking engagements lucrative memoirs and a library ""bigger than Clintons"" Coles not interested until he gets a gander at local veterinarian Sally Mannis (Maura Tierney). He decides to run -- and so does Sallys boyfriend town plumber Handy Harrison (Ray Romano). Cue the dirty tricks.Thats a great idea for a tart little political comedy especially since the script by Doug Richardson and Tom Schulman immediately brings the media in to cover ""the Maine Decision"" and chronicle the Cole-Sally-Handy romantic triangle with sadistic glee. Occasionally ""Mooseport"" lets loose with a gutbuster the mayoral debate that starts off with a round of rock-paper-scissors or the scene in which the ex-presidents rebuffed attempt to kiss Sally goodnight on her porch is replayed endlessly on national TV. With Telestrator graphics.Under Donald Petries scattershot direction such moments are depressingly few. The problems with ""Mooseport"" are obvious Too many subsidiary characters with not enough funny things to say and in Romano a lead actor who just isnt funny at all. Making his feature film debut (voicing the woolly mammoth in ""Ice Age"" doesnt count) the star of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" lands on the big screen like a bug on a windshield. Since Romanos a hugely successful TV comedian hes apparently been encouraged to improvise but the ensuing stammerings mutterings hemmings and half-gargled comebacks dont qualify as dialogue in any sense of the word. You hear crickets whenever hes onscreen.The other actors mug furiously in the vacuum except for old pro Hackman and Tierney who has an appealing new womanliness about her. Familiar character actors such as Wayne Robson playing a Mooseport leader squint their eyes and yell; as the alimony-hungry ex-first lady Christine Baranski flicks off her two-dimensional role like lint off a shoulder-pad; poor Marcia Gay Harden is stuck in the thankless part of Coles lovestruck mouse of an executive secretary. Rip Torn (as a battle-scarred campaign manager) and Fred Savage (as Coles hapless PR guru) tap-dance on the fringes.As befits a movie about a US president though ""Welcome to Mooseport"" has golf jokes and lots of them. Id hazard a guess the screenwriters might have even played a few holes given how much of the running time is given over to the minutiae of a face-off match between Handy and Cole. I can safely recommend the film for anyone who thinks the word ""mulligan"" is a guarantee of high comedy and for couples who spend more time on the fairway than at the multiplex. For everyone else ""Mooseport"" barely makes it out of the rough.(""Welcome to Mooseport"" 1/2)Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

This comedy about another ex-prez (Gene Hackman) who runs for mayor in flannel-shirt Maine is not even up to that level. This is a Moose ( out of four) the actors just cant goose in part because co-lead Ray Romano barely registers. (Related clip Watch a scene from Welcome to Mooseport) Who wouldnt want to see the real-life presidential candidates engage in a little paper-rock-scissors action? 20th Century Fox Beleaguered by a money-grubbing ex-wife (Christine Baranski) Hackman hopes to retire in solitude but is coerced into running unopposed -- until the local hardware store owner (Romano) throws his wrench into the ring. Then Hackman takes an interest in the town veterinarian (Maura Tierney) a longtime Romano squeeze. The rivalry becomes spectator sport for the rest of the country. David Mamet handled such small-town whimsy better in 2000s State and Main. Hackman could play his role in his sleep but Romano is asleep. Result Welcome to Mildport and thats being kind.

"Welcome to Mooseport | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; welcome-to-mooseport ) Welcome to Mooseport (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli What might have beena| Those four words tell the sad story of too many films and Welcome to Mooseport is one of them. It starts out with a terrific premise ripe with the potential for the kind of political satire we havent seen on the big screen since Bulworth what if a popular ex-president ran against a likable hardware store owner to be the mayor of a small town? But a premise is nothing more than a sturdy building block and in this case the filmmakers have employed the shoddiest construction crew imaginable. Welcome to Mooseports satirical edge is dull and pitted the screenplay is overlong and uninteresting the comedy is soft and shapeless and the actors perform like theyre on a sit com. Theres not a whole lot to like about Welcome to Mooseport and considering how lively real politics can be these days youre likely to get more entertainment from watching two hours of CSPAN. Monroe Eagle Cole (Gene Hackman) left office with the highest approval rating of any departing U.S. President. Ahead of him lie a whirlwind of profitable speaking engagements each netting 125000 (versus Clintons 100000) a ghost-written autobiography (for at least 10 million) and a 40000-square foot presidential library (versus Clintons 20000-square foot venue). All is well in Monroes world except that his rapacious ex-wife Charlotte (Christine Baranski) is eager to squeeze him for as much as she can get. Monroe decides to begin his ex-White House life in the little town of Mooseport Maine. Since the local mayor has just died the town council decides to offer the top job to Monroe. Thinking of the publicity angle he accepts - only to discover that someone else applied for the position. That someone is local handyman and hardware store owner Handy Harrison (Ray Romano). Handy is more than willing to withdraw until the ex-President starts wooing his girlfriend Sally Mannis (Maura Tierney) and then the gloves come off. With the help of his crack team - aides Grace (Marica Gay Harden) and Bullard (Fred Savage) and campaign manager Bert Langdon (Rip Torn) - Monroe goes into full election mode only to learn that he knows little about how to win when there are only 500 voters. Welcome to Mooseports humor whether its aimed at the political system or just trying to get a few mild chuckles is flaccid - a limp noodle has more starch. Any portion of drama that might have offset the failed comedy is compromised by a lack of credible characters. Monroe starts out as the epitome of a shallow charismatic politician then somehow morphs into a guy whos not really that bad after all. Handy on the other hand is so incredibly wimpy that its impossible to like the man. Everyone else is either shrill (Charlotte) or insignificant. And Sally manages to be the most uninteresting romantic foil in recent cinema. This is the big screen debut of Ray Romano (if you dont count his voice work for Ice Age). Despite being a major presence on television since 1996 Romano has not yet crossed over to movies and his lackluster work here may be an indication of why. The comedian-turned-actors low-key sadsack style may work in the comfy confines of ""Everyone Loves Raymond"" but in Welcome to Mooseport it leaves the audience cold. ""Raymond"" is funny and occasionally edgy; this movie is neither and Romano spends most of the movie trying to find a way to make his character affable and his dialogue funny. Meanwhile Gene Hackman tosses out the kind of adequate performance he could do in his sleep. Maura Tierney is singularly unappealing as Sally; she seems tired and considering some of the things her character has to say and do thats understandable. Christine Baranski deserves mention if only because shes so annoying that even one scene with her is too many. (Its possible to argue that this is great acting since its the character more than the actress whos unbearable.) Welcome to Mooseports director is Donald Petrie and a quick glance at his resume (which includes such memorable fare as My Favorite Martian Miss Congeniality and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days) sets expectations for this film. Yet in a case like this the blame should not rest entirely on the directors shoulders. Screenwriter Tom Schulman has to share equal responsibility; the characters are spouting his banal dialogue and his jokes sputter at an alarming rate. And if the filmmakers are foolish enough to believe they are offering any kind of insight into or witty commentary on politics theyre about as realistic as a candidates campaign promises.

And former U.S. President Monroe ""Eagle"" Cole (Gene Hackman) who has moved to his vacation home as a base for giving high-priced speeches is an old pol grown soft from the perks of office a pompous preener who wouldnt know how to operate his TV remote control without a hovering staff pretending not to do it for him. Coles shrewish ex-wife screeched by Christine Baranski schemes to keep her claws on his income; his martyr of an executive secretary enunciated by Marcia Gay Harden (one hopes she earned a bundle) fusses nearby monitoring how many sugar cubes he drops into his coffee. When did big-baby boobs like these come to represent American manhood at its most amusing? When did feature-length comedies like this one - written like an uninspired stump speech by Tom Schulman (""Dead Poets Society"") and directed like a rejected campaign ad by Donald Petrie (""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"") - come to settle for indistinguishably ""colorful"" characters as a substitute for anything really funny or sharp to say about American daily life? The Maine location and genteel-Yankee way of Mooseport life suggest the Kennebunkport summer habitat of George and Barbara Bush yet no use is made of Bushian habits; a few softball references to Coles higher polling numbers and fatter memoir advance than Bill Clintons are all that links fiction to reality - the better perhaps to make fun of the fawning fictional presidential staff. (The leathernecked Secret Service men on Coles detail are lunkheads; the PR director played by Fred Savage is a nattering yes-man; the campaign manager barked by Rip Torn is a conniving sharper.) The movies thin joke is that as the sitcom turns Cole and Harrison find themselves running against each other for town mayor. (Do election laws allow that?) And that through further agonizing plot contortions both of them compete for the affections of Sally one of those Tierney-riffic women whos warm and Ivory-soap sexy even when attending to the birth of puppies. ""Hes a genuinely honest man"" a disappointed staffer reports to Cole after looking for dirt with which to derail the plumbers grassroots campaign. ""That just means hes never run for office"" the President snarls back one of those reflexive but anesthetic perceptions about politics that substitute ha-ha for meaning. Romano of course has held the office of small-screen network star for a while and the persona he has established of a family man more genial slob/selfish adolescent than paterfamilias is genuinely a TV man. His comedy strength is in bits and stand-up observations 22-minute sitcom premises in which his shtick is offset in tightly charted story ""beats"" by the shtick of the players around him. A hometown schlemiel who is afraid to commit and doesnt realize that his girlfriend is as adorable as Maura Tierney - and who drags out his commitmentphobia for nearly two beatless hours - is as is now proven exactly the wrong character to get everybody to love Romano on the big screen. As for Hackman well. Apparently prohibited by ""Mooseport"" ordinance from making ""Eagle"" Cole into anything more than a generic Empty Suit in Chief he stomps through the picture like a candidate at his fifth rubber-chicken-dinner fund-raising stop of the evening. ""I had dignity once Does anybody remember that?"" the ex-Prez splutters. Its one of those terrible lines of dialogue that can come back and bite a Mooseporter in the butt.
