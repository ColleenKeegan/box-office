The first novel in Suzanne Collinss trilogy was the best with the second moderately worse and the third considerably so. The movies however got better and better from first to second to third. (The final book was split into two installments as is the fashion post-Harry Potter.) Related Story The Hunger Games Theme Park and the Death of the Disney Dream Alas that trend has now been arrested. The Hunger Games Mockingjay--Part 2 is the least enjoyable of the films by a considerable margin a dull grim slow-moving slog. The plot for those unfamiliar with it involves the final assault on the repressive Capitol by Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her rebel companions. Katniss and her squad are sent by the rebel leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) on whats supposed to be a relatively safe propaganda mission in areas of the Capitol already pacified by rebel troops. But Katnisss nemesis President Snow (Donald Sutherland) has seeded the city with deadly ""pods"" containing everything from machine guns to flamethrowers to a tidal wave of oily goo--effectively turning the Capitol itself into another iteration of the ""Hunger Games."" ""Our gamekeepers"" he cackles ""will make them pay for every inch with blood.""This storyline lifted straight from the novel--the apparent idea having been that each volume of the trilogy must have its own Hunger Games of one sort or another--is decidedly ridiculous and Im not sure how it could have been rescued without wholesale re-writing. (Obviously not an option.) But the director Frank Lawrence (no relation to Jennifer) and the screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong do themselves few favors in this outing.When Lawrence signed on as director before the second installment of the franchise he (along with his leading woman) brought a moral heft to the proceedings that had been lacking in the first film. His Hunger Games films werent merely about a tournament in which children kill one another they were about repression revolution and war on a broad scale. And while those themes are still present in Mockingjay--Part 2 theyre in scarce evidence onscreen. Instead the movie has narrowed into a tale of a single band of (mostly) young people lurching from one danger to another. The fact that a substantial portion of it takes place underground--Katnisss team take to the urban tunnels of the Capitol to get away from the pods--only adds to the claustrophobia.Scene after scene is held one two three beats too long in an effort to advertise its Great Moral Importance.Moreover this installment of the saga the grimmest of the series by far didnt need the additional solemnizing that Lawrence brought to its predecessors. Quite the contrary It could have benefited from an infusion of levity and/or velocity--two qualities conspicuously lacking. Scene after scene is held one two three beats too long in an effort to advertise its Great Moral Importance. The result is a movie that is too silly to be so somber and too somber to be much fun.The action sequences are muddy and confused and the lulls between them--which consist largely of tedious speechifying and long bouts of remorse and recrimination--interminable. The love triangle between Katniss Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) downplayed in the other films is heavy-handedly restored to center stage. (Particularly painful is a scene in which Peeta and Gale compare the varying degrees of authenticity of the kisses theyve received from Katniss.) And the final 20 minutes or so suffer from acute Return-of-the-King-itis with narrative postscript following narrative postscript following narrative postscript.Several principal characters from the previous films--Woody Harrelsons Haymitch Abernathy Elizabeth Bankss Effie Trinket Stanley Tuccis Caesar Flickerman--make only token appearances in this outing. But its the near-absence of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who died during filming that is most keenly felt. His ability to ground the series with understated irony was a crucial component of the earlier films success. (It borders on cruel that the last we hear from his character Plutarch Heavensbee is a letter delivered to Katniss that reads ""I wish I could have given you a proper goodbye."")Should committed fans of the franchise go see Mockingjay--Part 2? Of course they should (though perhaps with tempered expectations). Lawrence as always makes for a compelling Katniss and this is after all the completion of a long journey. Which is ultimately I suspect part of the problem. This is a movie so busy being a final chapter that it frequently forgets to be a movie.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

That makes The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 a competently staged yet emotionally unsatisfactory conclusion to an epic science-fiction series of dystopian dramas. This downbeat film also undercuts the thrill of seeing Jennifer Lawrence wrap up the saga of one of the great heroines in cinematic history. In Part 2 the actress and her character both seem a little out-of-sorts dispirited and perhaps even disinterested in what is unfolding as the story rumbles on to its deadly conclusion (and to its wholly unreal dreamlike denouement). Part of the problem of course is that this second part of the Mockingjay saga is depressing by its very nature especially the violence. That is how American author Suzanne Collins wrote it in her bestselling trilogy for young adults. But the bigger issue for the filmmaking team -- which was led once again by director Francis Lawrence -- is that the climactic and sometimes shocking twists of Mockingjay should not have spread out over two films. Each of the Mockingjay instalments have become so physically dark and so dramatically depressing that by the time we are heavily into the repetitive sequences of Part 2 the whole enterprise threatens to collapse under the burden of its protracted storytelling. The self-importance of it all also becomes insufferably self-important as if this is the complete history of humanity itself and not just one more treatise on the struggle between freedom fighters and fascism with sub-themes about the nuances brought into play by family friends and questions of loyalty and trust. Critically Part 2 is sadly bereft of the salty humour provided by Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy -- an element that previously provided a light-hearted balance to the darkness. In this final film however his character is just along for the ride -- as are Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket Willow Shields as Primrose Everdeen Julianne Moore as rebel president Alma Coin the sad ghost of Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and even the titan Donald Sutherland as the despotic Panem president. Sutherlands Coriolanus Snow has one last moment of fiery frisson with Lawrences Katniss Everdeen but it is too brief to really resonate. And it is just part of a plot twist that any attentive person can see coming long before Katniss commando squad and Coins rebel troops storm the Capitol. It may be pointless now but it is interesting to speculate on what the franchise would have become if the original co-writer and director Gary Ross had stayed for the whole ride. Instead he was gone after the first film with Lawrence taking over on the thrilling Catching Fire. Perhaps nothing would be different. The material itself rules the screen. What has not changed is the core tension between Lawrences conflicted Katniss and the two young men in her life Josh Hutchersons Peeta Mellark and Liam Hemsworths Gale Hawthorne. This of course is a classic love triangle albeit one set in the midst of civil war with one of the trio (Peeta) the victim of a horrifying brainwashing that has made him unstable and potentially violent towards his friends. The film puts as much emphasis on how Lawrence will choose between Peeta and Gale as it does to how her Katniss will survival the final battle at the Capitol. Just say that love conquers all -- but does not bring greatness to the film.

Murray Close/Lionsgate/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Are you a real Hunger Games fan? Take the quiz Monitor Movie Guide The most heroic thing about ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" is that Jennifer Lawrence is still formidable. This fourth and final installment of the rabidly successful franchise based on the Suzanne Collins novels is more of a dribble than a slam dunk but Lawrence is still acting away in it as if this represented more just a paycheck.Not that she gets to show all that she can do as an actress - not by a long shot (or an arrow shot). Shes fiercely glum throughout as her Katniss Everdeen leads a rebel commando squad into the heart of the Capitol. Her goal Kill President Snow played once again by Donald Sutherland with his trademark depraved panache.Director Francis Lawrence stages the action sequences both aboveground and underground with a modicum of flair and Julianne Moore as rebel leader Coin gives off some sparks - shes a reformer with a totalitarian streak - but for the most part there is nothing divertingly new or different about this franchise fade-out. When we last see Katniss in an idyllic pastoral tableau I felt happy for them but even happier for myself. No more sequels.

But the story still feels stretched a countdown that slows as it approaches zero hour. The various Districts long divided and conquered by the Capitol have united behind Lawrences Katniss Everdeen and declared war on their oppressors. But this isnt a war movie; its a movie about war a consideration of its tactics its strategems its presentation its resolution and its aftermath. As a result youre not here to watch Katniss kick ass. Youre here to watch Katniss agonize about ass-kicking then set out on a long journey to kick one very particular ass that of President Snow (Donald Sutherland splendid as ever). The scattered action set-pieces feel very much like sops to the stimulus-starved -- in particular an underground set-to with a bunch of anonymous humanoid mutts. And the various traps set for our heroes so potent in The Hunger Games arena now seem faintly silly. Why not just use bombs and soldiers? (Oh right -- because they cant shoot straight.)

(Murray Close/Lionsgate via AP) The character of Katniss played by Jennifer Lawrence offers a game-changing hero for a genre in desperate need of fresh blood.(Murray Close/Lionsgate via AP) review Saying goodbye to The Hunger Games series isnt going to be easy Add to ... JULIA COOPER Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 20 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 20 2015 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Francis Lawrence Written by Peter Craig and Danny Strong Starring Jennifer Lawrence Donald Sutherland and Julianne Moore Classification PG Genre adventure Country USA Language English ""My name is Katniss Everdeen"" croaks the woman whose revolutionary arrow has launched a civil war.Mockingjay - Part 2 - the fourth and final instalment of The Hunger Games series directed (mostly) by Francis Lawrence - opens with our hero (Jennifer Lawrence) raspier voiced than usual. Her vocal cords are bruised from an attack at the end of Part 1 at the hands of her brainwashed sweetheart Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). With dazed eyes and white hospital gown the Girl Interrupted aesthetic works for her but Katniss is no convalescent. She is a soldier she is a rebel she is - as the revolutions leader President Coin (a stiff Julianne Moore) reminds us - nothing short of mythic. Hunger Games cast leave handprints on Hollywood Boulevard (AP Video) The woman the myth the legend Katniss is like Robin Hood if Robin Hood had a sharper tongue more clearly defined politics and better hair. Shes like James Bond but without the surveillance-state apparatus behind her. Shes like Joan of Arc without the messy religious bits.Which is to say Katniss is fresh blood coursing through the heart of the action-hero genre. In the figure of Katniss the best parts of her predecessors fold into one tidy combat-ready outlaw with an unshakable moral compass - and not to get too emotional here its hard to say farewell. (Not least of all because Part 2 offers one last chance to see Philip Seymour Hoffman in a new release - all but two of his scenes as Plutarch Heavensbee had been filmed just before his death in 2014.)With its slower pace and clunky structure Mockingjay Part 1 is where the franchise experienced most of its growing pains but it set the scene for Katniss and her expanding band of rebels to rise from the literal ashes and overthrow the Capitol in Part 2. Until now Katnisss acts of revolt have been a part of someone elses larger plan - fodder for the pomp of the sacrificial games or as the poster girl for the revolution - but now our hero is singular in her vision assassinate that maniacal thorn in her side President Snow (Donald Sutherland top creep of the series).This revenge plot animates Mockingjay Part 2 with a satisfying rage. The film sheds the helplessness of the first two movies which centred on the barbaric games - Katnisss goal was not the toppling of a dictatorship but bare survival.If life in Panem has always been a game of life and death for the disenfranchised living in the districts then at least now thanks to Katniss and her tendency to go rogue at opportune moments the stakes of fighting finally have meaning. As the rebel Commander Paylor (Patina Miller) declares with a clenched fist in the air ""If we die let it be for a cause not a spectacle.""After a combined total of nine viewing hours though it can now be said with some authority that Lawrence has ably carried this series on her back and redefined for a new generation who can kick ass both onscreen and off.According to Forbes her rainmaking role as the mockingjay has her sitting on a cool 52-million (U.S.) out-earning any other woman in Hollywood. Katnisss mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson playing for cheap laughs) suggests that she ""might want to experiment with sensitivity and warmth"" for once - but nah angry Katniss is more potent. No one ever told Rambo or John McClane to play nice so why should she?It is almost criminal though that the end of this otherwise game-changing franchise full of bloodthirsty and complex women concludes on a painfully trite note - the strides made by all four films are undercut by Part 2s underwhelming and hokey epilogue. But if we are being honest with each other this goodbye was never going to be easy.

Review Mockingjay 2 makes for a rousing finale Tom Long The Detroit News 351 p.m. EST November 19 2015Jennifer Lawrence Mahershala Ali and Liam Hemsworth star in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2.""(Photo TNS)Explosive mostly true to the text complex and chock full of action ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" should more than satisfy the franchises many fans.That said if someone unfamiliar with the previous films or the Suzanne Collins novels on which theyre based were to walk in on the film it would likely seem a mystifying cacophony of startling images rumbling off a cliff. ""Mockingjay 2"" offers little in the way of backstory or explanation; youre already on this train or youre left behind.Happily millions aplenty are familiar and even obsessed with ""The Hunger Games"" story of revolution personal tragedy and duplicity in the post-apocalyptic world of Panem. And ""Mockingjay 2"" puts their conflicted heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) through all the physical internal and romantic turmoil her fans expect.The film begins right where ""Mockingjay 1"" left off (and again for newbies this will likely make no sense at all). Katniss is recovering from an attack by Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) her onetime love interest and ally who has been brainwashed by evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol and sent back to rebel headquarters to kill her.As the symbolic Mockingjay Katniss needs to appear to be leading the rebels into battle against Snow. All the bow-wielding Katniss actually wants to do is kill the president. After a bit of bringing all those outside the Capitol together and against the explicit orders of icy rebel leader Alma Coin (a spectacularly Gray Julianne Moore) Katniss decides to navigate her way through the dangerous Capitol streets to Snows mansion where she can kill him.Only problem is those streets are rigged with all sorts of deadly traps from mega-guns to man-made monsters to shifting sidewalks. But Katniss and a band of merry men and women -- including boyfriend option 2 Gale (Liam Hemsworth) old ally Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and videographer Cressida (Natalie Dormer) -- accept the challenge. Crazy Peeta even joins the charge somehow just to keep things interesting.And things do get interesting in a howling death sort of way. Those who were appalled at the initial premise of ""The Hunger Games"" -- forcing adolescents to fight to the death -- may faint at the audacity of this films penultimate climax. And in the end Katniss needs to decide where real evil lies.Most of the ancillary characters the franchise has introduced over four films still make appearances -- Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) Beetee (Jeffrey Wright) and Katnisss sister Prim (Willow Shields) as well as Phillip Seymour Hoffmans gamemaster (even though Hoffman died during filming).But the focus is overwhelmingly on Katniss in this outing (that focus wavered in ""Mockingjay 1"") which is as it should be and its to Jennifer Lawrences immense credit that she brings the same high game to a fantasy franchise that she brings to awards fare. She can run about in super-hero mode then suddenly drop down five notches or strip herself bare emotionally. She has been the best possible Katniss.And Katniss has obviously resonated with viewers and readers. An emotionally confused innocent from a humble background forced into the political world where treachery is a key part of the game and oppression is the accepted but resented norm. And yet hope still somehow survives.

"Hunger Games The Mockingjay Part 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hunger-games-the-mockingjay-part-2 ) Hunger Games The Mockingjay Part 2 (United States 2015) November 19 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Another so-called YA (Young Adult) motion picture property has reached its cinematic conclusion. Billed as ""the next big thing"" 3 1/2 years ago with the release of the first Hunger Games movie the series has lived up to its hype. The movie adaptation of the final book of Suzanne Collins best-selling trilogy Mockingjay has been bifurcated and although theres little doubt this was a financially savvy move the creative results are dubious.  Mockingjay Part 1 released a year ago was a disjointed incomplete affair and although Mockingjay Part 2 is more polished the pace is uneven and theres a sense that the series has hung around too long. In keeping with the tone of the source material Mockingjay Part 2 is bleak. Theres nothing wrong with this - plenty of the best sci-fi movies have been dark. The problem is that in addition to removing the light and hope Mockingjay has robbed the series of its uniqueness. Suddenly it feels like every other dystopian motion picture - and there are a lot of them out there. Its impossible to distinguish large stretches of Mockingjay Part 2 with characters running around in subterranean tunnels being chased by zombie-like creatures from similar segments of The Maze Runner movies or the Divergent series. They all blend together and thats not a good thing for any of them. The earlier Hunger Games movies stood apart. No longer. And Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) reduced to an automaton as a result of PTSD has become generic. Mockingjay Part 2 unsurprisingly begins where Part 1 ended. Katniss is recovering after nearly being choked to death by her former lover the traumatized and brain-washed Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Distressed about what has happened to Peeta Katniss volunteers to be part of an assault on the Capitol. Her goal is to confront and assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The President of the Resistance Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) is in favor of using Katniss for maximum political value even if that means turning her into a martyr. Joined by allies like Gale (Liam Hemsworth) Finnick (Sam Claflin) and Boggs (Mahershala Ali) Katniss makes a push for the Capitol but soon learns that her primary role may be as a decoy and media star. Despite some engaging battle scenes Mockingjay Part 2 at times becomes repetitive. The attack on the Capitol is overlong featuring a protracted sequence in tunnels and underground corridors. All this leads to an anticlimactic ending that although it makes a strong political point about the moral ambiguity of war is not cinematically satisfying. The ""twist"" at the end is neither surprising nor unexpected. Even those who havent read the book will see it coming. Another disappointment is the characterization of President Snow. The sneering Machiavellian dictator who sought Katnisss death throughout the first three films has been reduced to a feeble shadow of his former self. In Mockingjay Part 2 hes almost to be pitied. His schemes are ineffective and his inevitable downfall is dramatically inert. Snow who was unquestionably a villain ""we loved to hate"" in The Hunger Games and Catching Fire has devolved into a pathetic bad guy - someone its difficult to summon much feeling about one way or the other. If one of the expected pleasures of seeing Mockingjay Part 2 was to relish Snows inevitable downfall the way in which the narrative unfolds cheats viewers of that. When one considers the amount of talent packed into the cast of Mockingjay Part 2 it should come as no surprise that the acting level is high. Oscar winners and nominees abound. Jennifer Lawrence is not as compelling or charismatic as she was in the first two Hunger Games installments but thats a result of how the character is written - Katniss has been transformed into a shell-shocked revenge-driven Terminator. Josh Hutcherson does his best Manchurian Candidate impression but the chemistry he shared with Lawrence is missing. The Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle collapses into irrelevance. Many returnees from the previous installments (like Woody Harrelson Phillip Seymour Hoffman in his final role Stanley Tucci and Julianne Moore) are accorded little screen time and no opportunity for development. Director Francis Lawrence who did a good job with the action scenes in Catching Fire (he helmed all of the Hunger Games films except the first one) is unable to replicate his success here.  There are a few suspenseful sequences - a notable one involving an oil-trap and one that evidences an Aliens influence - but many of the movies so-called ""high octane"" sequences are visually impressive but emotionally shallow. Several key deaths have little or no impact. At least it can be said that Mockingjay Part 2 ends the saga. All the individual storylines are wrapped up and theres a nice little epilogue. Theres no doubting that this movie has high aspirations - it wants to depict war not as a rah-rah video game experience but as something violent desperate and destructive. But the compromises it makes to attract a wide audience neuter the message. Mockingjay Part 2 never goes ""all in"" and as a result it fails to satisfy as either a traditional sci-fi adventure blockbuster or an exploration of the dark side of war. The Hunger Games movies began with much promise but after the pinnacle of Catching Fire it has been a slog to the finish line. Were finally there and I feel more exhausted than fulfilled.

Photo Murray Close MOVIE REVIEW THE HUNGER GAMES MOCKINGJAY PART 2 Running time 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence). It hurts to see the Girl on Fire go out on such a lukewarm note. The final installment of the ""Hunger Games"" franchise manages to give us everything weve been waiting for and still underwhelm. The third and weakest book in Suzanne Collins trilogy should never have been split into two films but since thats become money-grubbing standard practice for young-adult adaptations (""Twilight"" ""Divergent"") here we are. Of course theres still the pleasure of watching Jennifer Lawrence as steely yet vulnerable Katniss Everdeen a heroine for the ages. But four films in its hard not to suspect that Katniss visible discomfort at being branded as the iconic Mockingjay is actually Lawrences at knowing this is all getting a little stale. We join her in recovery after being attacked by the brainwashed Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) at the end of ""Part 1"" but soon shes pleading with enigmatic rebel president Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and her adviser Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) for a return to the field as the insurgency prepares to take the fight to the Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland still deliciously sinister). After a brief stop to rally District 2 -- and meet with a commander played by Gwendoline Christie Brienne in ""Game of Thrones"" -- Katniss sneaks onto a convoy bound for the Capitol where she joins erstwhile love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and a small band of rebels including fellow Games survivor Finnick (Sam Claflin) to mount an assault and assassinate Snow. Julianne MoorePhoto Murray Close A tedious nod to video game culture ensues with a series of booby-trapped ""pods"" set by Snows game-makers. Fire bullets blades a flood of nebulous black fluid and quasi-zombies are deployed paring down the groups numbers. Courtesy of videographer Cressida (Natalie Dormer) and a stylist friend in the Capitol Katniss and Gale head to the presidential mansion hidden under . . . cloaks. A minor quibble for director Francis Lawrence Wouldnt this have been an excellent opportunity to trick them out in Capitol couture one of the most visually arresting aspects of the first two movies? And now a major one The climax of ""Mockingjay"" features the shocking death of one character which is downplayed here to an extent that I felt betrayed or at least misread Collins story. To a lesser extent the traumatized Peeta -- the storys emotional heavyweight -- is largely sidelined. Still there are moments. Though they all have little to do its heartening to check in with fluttery Effie (Elizabeth Banks) Woody Harrelsons wry Haymitch Stanley Tuccis Technicolor TV host Caesar Flickerman Jeffrey Wrights IT guy Beetee and Jena Malone as wounded warrior Johanna. More centrally the war of wills between Katniss and Snow -- girl power versus patriarchal tyranny -- remains as zesty as ever. But given how generic this films action sequences are Id have preferred just two hours of Lawrence and Sutherland narrowing their eyes at one another.

(Lionsgate)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 21 2015Katniss Everdeen can hang up her bow and arrow now and wipe away that look of sad defiant rage.With The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 the final installment in the adventures of a valiant teen and her battle against decadent authority figures and the cynical puppetmasters of a deadly reality-TV spectacle all the dystopian hooha comes to a crashing end.A franchise that made Jennifer Lawrence a star and made something like 2.3 billion at the global box office - not counting the chump change Part 2 is poised to make - The Hunger Games wrapped its message of media manipulation and the commercialization of violence in an action fantasy with a courageous independent woman as its star.The premise was - is - creepy and thrilling at the same time. Adapting Suzanne Collins best-selling Hunger Games trilogy (turned into a tetralogy for the benefit of Lionsgate shareholders) the filmmakers conjured up a postapocalyptic despotic North American nation called Panem where kids pursue kids in a televised Survivor-meets- Gladiator-style death match. The victor of the annual bloodfest is turned celebrity embarking on an elaborate road show touring Panems 12 districts and then getting to live out his or her life in pampered splendor.Meanwhile at the Capitol the 1 percent stuff their faces with fancy food parade around in gaudy couture and genuflect at the feet of President Snow played with an evil glower by Donald Sutherland.We all know how 2012s The Hunger Games turned out (what you dont? - two victors instead of one a revolt is born) and in 2013s Catching Fire and last years Mockingjay - Part 1 Lawrences Katniss was elevated to pop-star status a symbol of rebellion as iconic and inspiring as Che Guevara.Mockingjay - Part 2 starts off just a gasping rasping breath after Part 1s end with Katniss bruised and broken looking on at her District 12 sweetie Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) now strapped to a hospital bed having been turned against Katniss by means of ""tracker jacker venom"" - a mind-control drug administered by the Panem baddies (and sometimes available as the surprise in Cracker Jack boxes).If Mockingjay - Part 1 was walkier and talkier than its forerunners Part 2 is pretty much all action - and lesser for it.It doesnt take long for Katniss to get her voice back and join a ""propo"" squad - a troop of rebels in black SWAT gear that skirts the front lines of the bloody civil war shooting propaganda videos with Katniss as their star. Joining her is Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) her childhood friend and hunting buddy.When Peeta still reeling from his brainwashing regime is assigned to the unit no ones sure whether he can be trusted - and the blond highlights in Hutchersons hair make him especially suspect. Theres a love-triangle thing going on here Katniss and Peeta Katniss and Gale. Maybe she should consult with Bella Swan and see how that Team Edward/Team Jacob thing worked out.Directed by Francis Lawrence (no relation to his star) Part 2 offers a primer in how power corrupts and how absolute power corrupts absolutely. Not only is President Snow not to be trusted but President Coin (Julianne Moore with proclamations of shady nuance and streaks of white-gray hair) is no Miss Transparency herself.Philip Seymour Hoffman who died in February 2014 near the end of the films production is back as head gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. He has a few scenes with Lawrence and with Moore that make you wonder what the chitchat was like between takes. Serious actors these three seriously fooling around in their Hunger Games getups. R.I.P.There are slimy reptilian mutants in Mockingjay - Part 2 and there are scores of children in harms way. And there are a number of smart tough females Michelle Forbes as a rebel lieutenant who calls Katniss ""soldier""; Jena Malone as the shrewd District 7 tribute; Moores Alma Coin determined to make herself Coin of the realm.For all the guts and glory these women display the final scene of The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 - the final scene of The Hunger Games saga - has got to be a comedown. Itd be a spoiler to go into but this may be the first time in four movies where Lawrences expression doesnt look at all convincing.This is no face for a girl on fire.sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629Steven_Rea The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Francis Lawrence.

Murray Close/Courtesy of Lionsgate hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Courtesy of Lionsgate Jennifer Lawrence returns as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2. Murray Close/Courtesy of Lionsgate One of the first images we see in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 is that of Philip Seymour Hoffman. This is a welcome seance. We have said many farewells to Hoffman -- one of our generations finest actors here playing Panem resistance mastermind Plutarch Heavensbee -- since his death in February 2014 almost two years ago. This is not another goodbye. His breezy role here is more like meeting an old friend in town for a quick drink just before he leaves again for good. Sad to see you go sir but at least we did see you once more. Safe travels. But Hoffmans appearance also has an unintended effect. It reminds us that much of this final Mockingjay had finished filming by early 2014 having been shot at the same time as last years Part 1 and that everyone else involved with the film moved out of Panem a long time ago to better things. We would have been wise to do the same. This Hunger Game is one too many a 2010-era cash grab in its purest form more akin to a stern-faced curtain call than a fleshed-out story with a beginning middle and end. When the adaptations of Suzanne Collins dystopian trilogy began four years ago they were the intelligent visceral alternative to Twilight mania youth-skewing blockbusters that took their characters seriously and spoke to real-world conditions like few other YA stories. Now they feel like waiting rooms for A-list actors. Catch fleeting glimpses of Elizabeth Banks Stanley Tucci Woody Harrelson and Jeffrey Wright as their once-fascinating characters run out the clock until Lionsgate has finished wringing every last drop of irony-laced profit from its heroic young anarchist. As we begin the worlds children all know the tale of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence with a distinct ""Im getting too old for this"" look on her face). Shes the former battle royal contestant who beat the system the fabled ""moderate rebel"" who will lead the good Panem folk (Panemanians?) in an uprising against the evil overlords who have kept them in line for generations. At last films conclusion Katniss and her team including warrior love interest Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and slippery white-haired rebel leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore who knows how to wear a face of false concern) were gathering troops from across the war-torn districts for the final assault on the Capitol. Now despite the best efforts of her superiors to constrain her Katniss is on a single-minded hunt to kill archenemy President Snow (a perpetually impatient Donald Sutherland). The sudden arrival of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson whose unsettling performance is still the acting highlight of the series) complicates matters since he was previously under Snows thumb and had said some nasty things about his old pseudo-fling Katniss in public. But things would have been pretty complicated anyway based on the sheer number of expository conversations all these characters are having. In dividing Collins 390-page book into two movies screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong came up with a bad seven-10 split. All the compelling visuals and notes of characterization went into Part 1 leaving only endless serious dialogue a preposterous climax and (strangely) sewer mutants for the final 137 minutes. We learn in minute detail about all the land mines in the way the fighting between rebels and loyalists and the cyclical public debates over whether Katniss is dead. These many gusts of dead air will be ideal moments for the films intended audience to check Facebook once the whole 500 million-plus shebang makes its way to their laptops. Somehow despite the fact that the film is going nowhere director Francis Lawrence (who was also the Gamemaker for the last two entries) cant wait to get there and the editing hurries us along with tightly overlaid transitional audio. Part 1 wasnt doing much plotwise either but at least there was potency in its propaganda war. This film professes a new level of darkness and some key characters die but the closest it comes to a truly distressing moment is a half-second shot of a child we dont know wailing over her dead mother after a bomb attack on what looks like a line of Capitol refugees. And how about that Capitol? The trademark symbol of tone-deaf opulence used to be such a treat when Panems outlandishly dressed leaders would parade the Tributes down gold-plated streets and onto that insidious government-controlled talk show. Most recently the setting has inspired a fantastic recurring bit on The Late Show where Stephen Colbert sends off the ""fallen"" presidential candidates while dressed as Tuccis giddy gadfly. Somewhere in the middle of Mockingjay the rebel force turned the Capitol from gilded to gutted as it had to for purposes of the story. All that eye-popping window dressing became washed-out and arid and parts of the film were shot in Berlin to evoke the sense of a withering city. But the kicker is that we never get to see the forced transition the gold collapsing under its own stack-of-cards government -- otherwise known as the symbology the entire series was building toward. Katniss and her fellow soldiers lay siege to an already destroyed city where the bad guy just happens to live. Any sense of Panems tectonic plates shifting from under our feet is utterly absent. When all is said and done in this world we are left with a cruel irony With Hoffman The Hunger Games resurrected the dead. But the franchise fought so hard to keep itself alive that it couldnt go out the way it was always meant to.

"Review Jennifer Lawrence and The Hunger Games deserved a better ending than Mockingjay -- Part 2 - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Jennifer Lawrence and The Hunger Games deserved a better ending than Mockingjay -- Part 2 The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 review by Kenneth Turan The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan reviews ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth. The Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan reviews ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" starring Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is exactly what you would expect from its ungainly title and that turns out to be not quite enough.Thats a bit sad because novelist Suzanne Collins saga of resistance and rebellion in the totalitarian future state of Panem as led by redoubtable warrior Katniss Everdeen has been such a reliable staple of popular entertainment that it would be swell if the fourth and final film of the series ended things on a completely satisfying note. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story And in truth many of the same elements of the previous films are present here. Stars Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth return for the fourth time as ace archer Everdeen and her pair of devoted swains director Francis Lawrence is back for his third film and screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong mark this as their second effort. Even the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who appeared in two other films in the franchise is seen briefly in the finale. On the level of stunts and action ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" has its share of briskly executed efficiently done set pieces as the rebellion against that nasty President Snow (Donald Sutherland) edges closer and closer to the Capitol.But what made the best of the ""Hunger Games"" movies so effective was the emotional connection its shrewd plotting created by combining a coming-of-age saga romantic rivalry and broader concerns about violent spectacle used to manipulate public opinion. Hunger Games finale A behind-the-scenes glimpse of the final assault in Mockingjay -- Part 2 Meredith Woerner Its the last stand for the Mockingjay -- Jennifer Lawrences Katniss Everdeen -- and her army of rebels. Set in a dystopian society where children are made to battle for sport and the haves live a life of luxury at the expense of the have-nots ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is the culmination... Its the last stand for the Mockingjay -- Jennifer Lawrences Katniss Everdeen -- and her army of rebels. Set in a dystopian society where children are made to battle for sport and the haves live a life of luxury at the expense of the have-nots ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is the culmination... (Meredith Woerner) In theory all this should come to a head in this final film but the aesthetically misguided idea of breaking the final book into two films commercially remunerative though it might have been has ended up making the dragged-out proceedings feel anti-climactic and emotionally static.For one thing ""Part 2"" has to cope as ""Part 1"" did before it with the absence of any actual Hunger Games action and the emotion those teen versus teen battles engendered is missed even more here. More than that key plot elements left to be determined like Katniss Betty or Veronica choice between longtime companion Gale Hawthorne (Hemsworth) and her Hunger Games partner the charisma-challenged Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson) have had so much screen time devoted to them in earlier films that the resolution is too inevitable to be involving.Similarly the unexpected twists ""Mockingjays"" story throws at us as the conclusion nears had more effect -- and more surprise -- on the page than they manage on the screen where key elements have been telegraphed more than they are in print. For the die-hard fans around the world whove already paid 2.3 billion at the box office to see the previous films these quibbles will likely matter little or not at all compared with seeing the resolution they likely already know enacted by flesh-and-blood actors. For the ""Hunger Games"" brain trust has clearly decided to pitch this last film to those most devoted to the franchise with little attempt made to fill in the blanks for any late arrivals or those whose familiarity with the material is not encyclopedic.So if ""Part 1"" ended on Page 177 of the book with a brainwashed and delusional Peeta attempting to throttle Katniss (oh the horror ...) ""Part 2"" begins on the very next page with Katniss trying to cope with her injuries. Even Saturday matinee cliffhanger serials of which these films are in a sense the modern version worked harder to bring generalists up to speed.Once Katniss regains her health she becomes focused on infiltrating the Capitol and speedily ending the life of President Snow whose nefarious plan it was to turn Peeta against her.But rival President Coin (Julianne Moore) the canny head of the opposition rebels has other plans for the by-now-famous Mockingjay the symbol of resistance to tyranny and they do not include risking her neck in combat situations.But Katniss being Katniss finds a way around that reluctance if only a partial one. She Gale Finnick (Sam Claflin) the recovering but still unreliable Peeta and other folks form a kind of celebrity attack squad that is supposed to be used mainly for propaganda purposes. Hunger Games Los Angeles premiere honors victims of Paris attacks Trevell Anderson Stars of ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" paid their respects to the victims of attacks in Paris last week during the Los Angeles premiere of the film Monday night by wearing modified mockingjay pins wrapped in red white and blue ribbon -- the colors of the French flag. This show of support... Stars of ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" paid their respects to the victims of attacks in Paris last week during the Los Angeles premiere of the film Monday night by wearing modified mockingjay pins wrapped in red white and blue ribbon -- the colors of the French flag. This show of support... (Trevell Anderson) Things dont go exactly as planned however and Katniss and company face numerous daunting obstacles including booby traps created by the Capitols games makers and a savage attack by genetically mutated lizard men who dont have a friendly bone in their body.While the other ""Hunger Games"" films had their static moments they could always count on Lawrences palpable passion for the part to energize the proceedings a passion that is not conveyed as strongly this time around.Because the two parts of ""Mockingjay"" were filmed back to back in a massive 152-day period the films overall lassitude may well be due to exhaustion as much as anything else. Whatever the cause its one of the reasons ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" earnest and acceptable though it is doesnt end on the kind of high note it deserves.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2MPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action and for some thematic materialRunning time 2 hours 17 minutesPlaying In general release--MORE REVIEWSLatin Grammy Awards High political drama reggaetons rise and Will Smiths return to rap Saints amp; Strangers and Pilgrims make clear Thanksgivings thorny origins2015 films you need to see Anything by Kristen Wiig Results and more Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on November 19 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""AT THE MOVIES - Last shot falls short of mark - `The Hunger Games deserves a better ending - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Reviews Movies Entertainment Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth The Hunger Games Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-hunger-games-review-20151119-column.html,200,thehungergamesmockingjay-part211,thehungergamesmockingjay-part2,latimes

Never mind that her arrows have incendiary tips.

Comments click to enlarge The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 Rated PG-13  136 minutes  2015 This fourth and final installment of the Hunger Games franchise is by far the most dour consisting mainly of dim uninspired battle sequences. The amazon heroine (Jennifer Lawrence) takes part in an armed insurrection against the totalitarian government that caused so much suffering in the other films. Like the previous episodes this hinges on her loss of innocence; her crushing discovery this time is that the leader of the insurrection (Julianne Moore) is no more merciful than the dictator they aim to depose. There are some halfhearted lessons about the merits of democracy but the priority is sci-fi action--too bad it isnt all that rousing. Francis Lawrence directed; with Liam Hemsworth Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman in his last role.

(Murray Close/Lionsgate via AP) ""Ill say this for you Katniss"" mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) tells stalwart heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2."" ""You dont disappoint.""The same cant quite be said for ""The Hunger Games"" movies themselves. ""Mockingjay -- Part 1"" which ended smack in the middle of its most exciting sequence disappointed some fans many already grumbling over the decision to split Suzanne Collins final book in the middle creating parts 1 and 2.Some of those grumbles stemmed from the fact that ""Mockingjay"" was nobodys favorite book in the trilogy. Starting with as much light and hope as could be expected in a story about children forced into an arena to kill other children the ""Hunger Games"" books grew darker and grimmer with ""Catching Fire"" and almost fatally bleak (nightlock pill anyone?) with ""Mockingjay."" Related 12 memorable love triangles from TV and moviesNevertheless ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is no disappointment. Director Francis Lawrence who took over the franchise with the second movie and screenwriters Peter Craig and the always reliable Danny Strong have crafted an exciting involving finale streamlining the complicated end game of Collins story without shortchanging the climactic action.When last seen Katniss had been choked almost to death by her brainwashed friend/love interest Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). ""Part 2"" picks up from that moment with Katniss puzzled by Peetas betrayal turning again to friend/love interest Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).With rebels from the downtrodden Districts in an escalating war with the Capitol Katniss is the Mockingjay the inspirational face of the freedom fighters. But she has only one target in her sights President Snow played with bloody relish by Donald Sutherland. (If it crossed your mind to make ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" the first movie in the ""Hunger Games"" series to see forget that. Youll have absolutely no idea whats going on and book readers are at an additional advantage here.)Laughs are far between in ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" with even the quirky Haymitch unable to lighten the atmosphere. War is hell and Francis Lawrence shoots the movie in a cold blue gray almost unrelieved by color except when fire breaks out.Thats fitting given the terrible things Katniss and her team confront (an attack by mutants called Mutts all slime and teeth is horrifyingly exciting) and the series of heartbreaking deaths one tougher to take than the next. ""The Hunger Games"" has a lot to say on the subject of war including responsibility and blame loyalty and its limits. Scenes echo Nazi Germany and its death trains; other remind us of current refugee roundups.Thats for later analysis though. As ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" shrieks to its conclusion youll mainly want to see how Katniss can get the better of President Snow and then (after a killer twist) whether she can put her life back together with Peeta. Or Gale.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan November 19 2015 Just in time for ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" the fourth and final movie in the series heres everything you need to know about the previous three films. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) When all -- or nearly all -- is said and done toward the end of the 2 1/4 -hour final film in ""The Hunger Games"" saga Woody Harrelson as the cynical Haymitch Abernathy turns to Jennifer Lawrences arrow-slinging heroine Katniss Everdeen and voices what at that point is probably what everyone in the audience is thinking. ""Katniss"" he wisecracks ""Ill say this for you You dont disappoint."" As the dystopian epics emotional moral and physical heart Lawrence once again delivers the best reason to stick with it. Closing out the franchise inspired by Suzanne Collinss literary trilogy ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" picks up virtually where ""Part 1"" left off with a close-up on Lawrences battered face. Her expression full of steely resolve commands our attention in a way that the film that follows does only sporadically. Last years ""Part 1"" set up the story of Katniss as a revolutionary leader fighting a repressive regime with a war of propaganda. Katniss -- or the Mockingjay as her followers have come to call her -- became the face of a viral rebellion appearing in slick videos meant to rally and inspire the troops. But that story (or half-story) was the equivalent of Katniss drawing back her bow and it ended as if in freeze-frame with an arrow metaphorically poised to fly. Jennifer Lawrence returns in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" as Katniss Everdeen. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) Lawrence leads a team of rebels through the Panem capital in the ""Hunger Games"" finale. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) In ""Part 2"" the missile is at long last released as Katniss doesnt just pose for the camera but penetrates with a squad of handpicked rebel fighters and the documentary crew following them (Natalie Dormer Elden Henson and Wes Chatham) deep into enemy territory. The film follows her attempt to assassinate President Snow (Donald Sutherland) head of the government that keeps most of the citizens of Panem in chains. Almost as aerodynamic as her arrow in a form-fitting all-black military ensemble that makes her look both formidable and foxy Katniss spends most of this movie making her way slowly -- and I do mean slowly -- through the streets of Panems capital toward Snows heavily defended compound. Although deserted the city has been booby-trapped by the same game designers who previously entertained the ruling elite and us with creative mayhem. Tripwired machine guns flamethrowers and a tsunami of black goo have been set up to explode like land mines throughout the city. This makes for something of a cinematic slog. Its slow going as Katniss and company which includes her rival boyfriends -- Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) freshly deprogrammed from Snows mind-control lab (or is he?) -- try to avoid getting killed. The first half of the film feels overly cautious never really picking up a pulse until our heroes are attacked in the sewers by a horde of slimy gray mutants called mutts. Its great exciting filmmaking for something that is mostly CGI. And yet still there is an hour to go before Katnisss final projectile finds its mark. Who winds up getting it in the end is supposed to be a twist. But even those who havent read the books will see it coming from a long way off. The thwack of the arrowhead feels satisfying as closure goes but perfunctory. Most of the pleasure of ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" comes from watching Lawrence not the story around her. Her aim is true even if the narrative arc of the movie traces a long wobbly path toward its eventual and not exactly happy resting place. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of violence and action. 136 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Teamed with a group of her closest friends - including Gale Finnick and Peeta - Katniss goes off on a mission with the unit from District 13 as they risk their lives to stage an assassination attempt on President Snow who has become increasingly obsessed with destroying her. The mortal traps enemies and moral choices that await Katniss will challenge her more than any arena she faced in The Hunger Games. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Not since Slave Girl Leia converted her chains into weapons and strangled Jabba the Hutt has science fiction created a freedom-fighting heroine as striking as Katniss Everdeen. In ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" one character describes the popular young woman at the forefront of the citizens revolt as ""mythic."" You said it. For four years now Jennifer Lawrence has knocked the poignant role out of the park left right and center. Playing the blue-collar huntress defending the population of dystopian Panem against its vicious foppish tyrants Lawrence plays viewers sympathies like a Wurlitzer pipe organ. She has led a film franchise whose casting decisions have been as impressive as its relatable themes social commentary and ultra-realistic visual effects. Now with ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" we bid a regretful farewell to the series. The good news is that it closes in world-class style that most superhero movies would envy. It is a fitting finale for a series that has set a high-water mark for screen adaptations of young adult fiction. Unlike the first two films which focused on Katniss and her friend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) surviving the televised combat of the games the final two follow the struggle between Panems corrupt leaders and their rebellious foes to gain the upper hand in media propaganda. Although the managers of the uprising want to keep her safe and ready to give the cause inspiring video publicity Katniss joins in marathons of military warfare alongside her best friend hunting partner and would-be lover Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Traumatized by the torture-induced brainwashing that crippled Peeta Katniss wants nothing more than to bring her high-tech bow and arrows within striking distance of the nations despicable President Snow (Donald Sutherland as before in chillingly evil form). The plot is minimalist but as the film moves forward to literal and symbolic fallen snow the final showdown delivers a hearseload of thrills. Director Francis Lawrence creates tense fierce excitement. In part it comes from nerve-churning action. One extended scene puts Katniss and her commando troop in sewers overrun by flesh-eating zombies the sort of shocking sequence that can give you a serious case of the creeps. There are even stronger jolts in a battle scene at the capitol that produces horrific civilian casualties. MURRAY CLOSE Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) takes aim at toppling President Snow and his evil empire. But most of the thrills come from the outstanding character work as different cast members attempt to take charge of the unpredictable situation. The film unfolds in a dark side of life where absolute power corrupts absolutely even among the leaders of a necessary uprising. It often feels designed as a horror-driven metaphor for Americas crumbing social order. Katniss rises from her shabby coal mining hometown to national stardom by climbing up the sort of televised elimination battles and beauty contests produced by Donald Trump -- programs where she is sized up as just another expendable extra. The leadership ambitions of the revolutions President Coin (quietly malevolent Julianne Moore) are just as Machiavellian as the tyrant she aims to replace. The film is not just a good exciting emotionally involving story but an allegory that fits inside our present cultural bubble. In an era of terror and waterboarding this is a science fiction film about people under siege in their own War on Terror showing how hard they would fight to stay alive. Its a balanced nightmare the fantasy that keeps on giving. If the film shortchanges us its in terms of the all-star cast we would like to see longer. Theres just one rapid appearance by Stanley Tucci as a cynical broadcaster two for Jeffrey Wright as an idealistic leader of the revolution and a small handful for the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (who died during this production) as an ingenious strategist who served both camps. Hoffman deserves but doesnt receive a salute in the opening of the end credits like Paul Walker had in the latest ""Fast and Furious"" film. But there is much to admire in this film and the entire series reaching beyond YA blockbusters like ""Divergent"" and ""The Maze Runner"" through deep messages important themes and the transformation of a gifted actress into a worldwide star. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Photo Murray Close/Lionsgate The final film adaptation of Suzanne Collinss dystopian Hunger Games YA novels Mockingjay -- Part 2 is a potent antiwar saga bleak savage and very modern in the depiction of an unholy union between political manipulation and showbiz. Its impressive -- but then The Hunger Games is made of finer stuff than the standard fanboy-bait studio ""franchises."" Maybe its that a woman wrote the books (although a woman also wrote the dumb reactionary Divergent series so go figure). These are war movies in which no victory is orgasmic There are no exploding Death Stars no triumphal processions no propagandistic symbols that arent inherently suspect. All right one climactic slaying has a satisfying thump but otherwise no one dies well. The heroine Katniss Everdeen is sickened by her warrior persona the winged black-clad ""Mockingjay"" which is used as an icon of the rebel alliance like Delacroixs painting of ""Liberty"" leading the French people at the barricades. To Katniss killing is obscene the upshot of a malevolent state that holds power by pitting citizen against citizen -- and most notoriously in the annual Hunger Games child against child. Related Stories The Hunger Games Mockingjay a Part 1 Is Bleak Depressing and Really Good The 100 Most Delightful Things Jennifer Lawrence Has Ever Done Apart from adding a billion dollars to its coffers Lionsgate had no reason to split Collinss final book into two parts. (""Could there be a better reason?"" you ask.) It takes a while for Mockingjay -- Part 2 to recover the storys momentum. It begins with Jennifer Lawrences Katniss in close-up getting a brace taken off her bruised neck -- the result of an attack by Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) the man she loves and whose life she saved now brainwashed into wanting to kill her. Even if you dont remember the end of Mockingjay -- Part 1 the look on Lawrences face instantly establishes the overriding emotion anguished incomprehension. I cant imagine how this role could be played more vividly. Lawrences performances in all four films -- even the first which was poorly directed by Gary Ross -- have caught that distinctive ""YA"" element the disconnect between Katnisss inner world and how shes seen by others. A film crew (led by Natalie Dormer) follows her into battle broadcasting her moves in real time to the beleaguered outlying districts firing up the citizens for the fight against the Capitol District 1 home of a decadent elite and its mass-murderer president. But much of what Katniss does is stiff her every ""heroic"" gesture freighted with self-consciousness. Like Lawrence herself Katniss cant play scenes she doesnt believe. And though she knows what shes fighting against -- she thinks the mass-murdering President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is a fount of evil -- shes not sure what shes fighting for. The president of the rebel alliance Alma Coin is played by Julianne Moore with a white streak in her hair like Susan Sontag (or a skunk) and shes all tight smiles and bland canned rhetoric. Behind the scenes she coolly plots with her consultant Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to exploit the Mockingjay symbol for all its worth. Whos to say that the rebel leader is not President Snows mirror image? The director Francis Lawrence has a heavy touch -- but this is heavy stuff. Exteriors consist of either the rubbled remains of what were once homes for human beings or inhumanly huge squares that evoke Germany at its most fascistic. One long sequence takes place in a sewer in which the only living things besides the rebels are monsters that wipe out half the cast. Absent is anything green anything organic. The Capitols super-capitalists have denuded the world. Mockingjay suffers from two terrible casting decisions carried over from Rosss first Hunger Games Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth as Katnisss hunky first boyfriend Gale. The former is actually better than usual hitting a couple of good anguished notes as Peeta fights against his brainwashing. But his acting is still small-scale. As for Hemsworth hes hopeless; he makes a dull role duller. The love triangle doesnt upstage the real story -- a war being fought with bombs bullets and symbols -- but its touch-and-go. Mockingjay -- Part 2 is all Lawrence though a couple of others have their moments. As a ravaged former political prisoner given to mocking the Mockingjay Jena Malone is -- as usual -- delightfully twisted She kicks every movie shes in into a queerer (in the old sense) gear. Embracing the chance to be illiberal Sutherland relishes every hammy piece of villainy and though Julianne Moore doesnt rise above the material her implacable glassiness has its charm. Shes the worst-case Hillary scenario. The most problematic role is that of Philip Seymour Hoffman as the sly Heavensbee not because he isnt good but because he isnt there for the second half having died in the middle of shooting. Lawrence edits in reaction shots taken from other scenes (or other movies?) and at the end adds an obvious digital image. Showbiz trickery however powerful cant yet reanimate the dead. Im not slighting Mockingjay -- Part 2 when I say that it ends less with a bang than a whimper. Theres regrowth but not enough -- yet -- to compensate for whats gone. I wish every war movie ended on a note of loss and maybe with more female writer-directors on the horizon (excluding Kathryn Bigelow who gives men penis envy) more war movies will. In the meantime this is the rare superhero saga in which the hero isnt her true self until she can shed her costume and live in a world that has no need of symbols.

Since The Hunger Games started in 2012 shes starred in four of them and only six of everything else. Luckily those other films took her to the Academy Awards twice which added to her first Oscar trip for the grim indie Winters Bone makes the 25-year-old the face of Hollywoods two career tracks blockbuster royalty and the prestige nominee.Katniss Everdeen the part that put Lawrence on billboards from Tribeca to Taiwan is the role thats most unlike her very public image. Lawrences doofy golden child is the inverse of Katniss a severe unsmiling brunette. The only thing Lawrence and Katniss have in common is a sense that despite all their handlers and even their own retrained intentions when the cameras come on theyll both blurt whatever they want.Film DetailsCritics Pick The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time136 min. More Info Impulsiveness has been Katniss key trait. Her every great act has been unplanned threatening to commit suicide on TV blowing up the Games arena and most pivotally becoming a figurehead for the rebellion when shed rather just be home making fun of her sister Primroses cat. Throughout the series Lawrences stone face is unreadable. We never know what Katniss will do until she does it and one suspects she doesnt either. Its an ascension by happenstance and one she sorely regrets as the public pressures her to live up to ideals shes never claimed to embody.I too tend to prefer deliberate ascensions -- such as I suspect Lawrences own. That triumph feels earned not merely bestowed or worse predetermined from birth -- all those Chosen Ones represent the worst ego-stroking trope in Millennial Generation cinema. In film series like Harry Potter Divergent and The Matrix as well as The Giver and the Star Wars prequels all tension is sapped by biological anointment. Has a chosen hero ever failed?

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Yet its Katniss choices not her chosen status that prove to be exactly right even when in the moment we worry theyre all wrong. In this last installment when a Capitol loyalist puts a gun to her throat and growls ""Give me one good reason why I shouldnt shoot you"" her spontaneously bad answer -- ""I cant"" -- turns out to be just the suicidal mea culpa he needs to hear.Before the Hunger Games films launched I bought the first book to understand why it mattered. I ended up marathoning the entire trilogy before sunrise. Suzanne Collins vision was gutting gory and satisfyingly cynical about the purity of heroism. The first film however disappointed. The books grisly deaths proved no match for a PG-13 rating and the kids-on-kids kill-frenzy of my imagination was just a whiffed punch.As the series continued it got better even as the carnage remained chaste. Now in Mockingjay 2 which Ive always mentally subtitled ""The One Where Everyone Dies"" people are torn apart exploded strung up shot. Theres not a drop of blood but each murder still hurts both because weve come to care about the characters and because after so much death more death tips over into existential futility.Hundreds die so that President Snow (Donald Sutherland) -- an old man who wheezes as if hes got just one day left -- can for a few more feeble hours preserve his posh lifestyle. Its no coincidence that to play the eerily self-contained rebel leader of District 13 President Coin Julianne Moore had to dye her hair gray. Since the Greek titans the old have forever devoured the young.The series is no longer primarily interested in just one girls survival -- and thankfully its barely engaged with the love triangle that Collins had to flog to keep fans interested until she reached her real goal Mockingjays large cynical questions about sacrifice and success. (Which in book form were almost too dense -- the filmmakers were right to divide the last volume in two.) In the first Hunger Games film we were simply meant to care whether Katniss won. Three movies later as Katniss helps Coin defeat the Capitol and destroy Snow the series has become about how horrible it can be to win. It sticks us in that brutal stretch of a war where everyone knows the imminent outcome but half will have to die to accomplish it.In victory Katnisss friends arent much better than her foes. In her name rebels cheer the Snow-ally District 2s civilian dead just as TV audiences cheered the Hunger Games arena. ""Sometimes killing isnt personal"" advises heartthrob Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Katniss is aghast. Isnt that even worse?But Katniss isnt innocent. Before she just wanted to survive. Now she wants vengeance for Snow torturing her off-again boyfriend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). And screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong are smart enough to upend that revenge beat when Johanna (Jena Malone) grimly notes that she was also tortured alongside Peeta but that because shes not a media sweetheart no one cares. Even among the good guys some lives are worth more than others -- especially if they make good propaganda.The Hunger Games has always been a TV war slyly satirized as in a tense city invasion where a camera crew asks Katniss to hold off shooting her bow until they can get the right shot. Now Lawrence and the filmmakers use that celebrity for suspense Theres a horribly great sequence in a sewer that pays homage to Aliens a quiet nail-biter wherein Katniss now disguised as a Capitol resident is recognized by a toddler.But most astonishingly with the franchises powerful climax Lawrence has managed to align her parallel Hollywood lives and reinvent the prestigious popcorn flick a crowd-pleaser with intelligent class. Perhaps shes glad to finally retire dour dark-haired Katniss. The Oscar race will welcome her back. But as fashionable as it is to whine about blockbusters gobbling up all the young acting talent I like visiting a world -- even a brutal teen dystopia -- where our big flicks are as smart as our small ones.THE HUNGER GAMES MOCKINGJAY -- PART 2 | Directed by Francis Lawrence | Written by Peter Craig and Danny Strong based on the novel by Suzanne Collins | Lions Gate | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Part 1 was so padded and puffed up that the exciting parts got lost in the stuffing. More News Peter Travers on Mockingjay Epic Scope and Suspense Jennifer Lawrence Amy Schumer Co-Writing Sisters Movie Hear Jennifer Lawrences Haunting Hunger Games Ballad All Stories >> Related Jennifer Lawrence Americas Kick-Ass Sweetheart How the Hunger Games star became the coolest chick in Hollywood The good news is that Mockingjay - Part 2 the big finale has quit the ass-dragging in favor of what made the book a page-turner. Theres the visual fireworks for sure. But theres also the darkness of the theme about how power can corrupt heroes as well as villains. Director Francis Lawrence returns with screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong and they behave like workhorses with the bridles off. Will this new energy reverse the series diminishing box office? Mockingjay - Part 1 fell more than 70 million short of the originals wowza 408 million gross. If Mockingjay - Part 2 rides into boffo nirvana thank the actress in the saddle. Jennifer Lawrence has won an Oscar (Silver Linings Playbook) and global stardom since she first played the role of Katniss Everdeen in 2012. Lawrence 25 took Katniss from a shy teen enslaved in poverty to become the ""girl on fire"" the rebel freedom fighter armed only with bow and arrow and a spirit to bring down the Capitol run by the despotic President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Lawrence is the kind of star youd follow anywhere which makes her the perfect Katniss. Even when the Hunger Games series gets winded pimping old tricks Lawrence is the oxygen that brings it back to life. Katniss seizes her role as the Mockingjay the symbol of hope for the movement to end Snows reign of terror. The movie gives her other obstacles. Frankly I dont give a damn whether Katniss ends up with dull Gale (Liam Hemsworth) or puckish Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) whos brainwashed by Snow but not enough to give him a personality. The juice comes outside the love story. Sutherland is a sneering delight as Snow. Julianne Moore excels as Alma Coin the rebel leader Katniss trusts at her peril. Elizabeth Banks is a marvel as shallow Effie Trinket the fashion eccentric (think Gaga unleashed) who becomes a Katniss ally. Philip Seymour Hoffman didnt live to finish his role as gamemaster Plutarch. But we hear the characters final words in a letter movingly read by Woody Harrelsons Haymitch. Though Katniss is tracked by Cressida (Natalie Dormer) a videographer tasked with propagandizing the Mockingjay as a reality star Lawrence makes sure we see Katniss coming into her own. Even with the rush of action - firebombs land mines underground mutants a near-drowning in black oil - Katniss finds her moral center. That gravity is a risk in a Hollywood aimed at short attention spans. But it sets Mockingjay - Part 2 above the herd and lets The Hunger Games go out in style. Sweet.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1108am on Saturday Nov. 21 2015 Saturday Nov. 21 2015 Saturday Nov. 21 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 the fourth and final installment in the big-screen treatment of novelist Suzanne Collins hugely popular young-adult series makes good on the promise of the last film which was all build-up and no release. At once surprisingly dark and warmly celebratory Part 2 balances its dystopian political themes and talk of power struggles with a couple of big-bang action set pieces that are absolute knockouts.While Part 2 isnt transcendent -- those who havent cared about the books or the first three films certainly wont be persuaded now -- it is a more than satisfactory wrap-up for fans to what has been an uneven cinematic franchise. While it doesnt scale the heights of Catching Fire the second movie its heads shoulders and quiver above the first and the third.At the end of Part 1 Hunger Games champ and archery ace Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) had become a symbol of revolution in the land of Panem and was working with resistance leader President Coin (Julianne Moore) to overthrow the despotic President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Meanwhile Katniss boyfriend and fellow Hunger Games victor Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is under the control of Snows henchmen. He has been mentally tortured and brainwashed into believing Katniss is his enemy.As Part 2 begins Katniss Coin and other revolutionaries -- including Gale (Liam Hemsworth) the other guy after Katniss heart -- are getting ready to launch their offensive against The Capitol. But Katniss is torn as an emotionally battered and recovering Peeta now in the hands of Coin still might be trying to kill her.When Katniss and crew do enter The Capitol they find themselves playing a game even more deadly than usual. Snows gamemakers the ones who once designed the perilous Hunger Games that Capitol residents watched as entertainment have booby-trapped the now largely abandoned city with killer obstacles. This is where Part 2 revels in its CGI glory.Our heroes go underground to try to avoid the dangers and here the film becomes dark claustrophobic and suspenseful. Once again Lawrence keeps the story rooted in human emotions not just special effects even if the love triangle remains pallid and is the least intriguing element. More interesting is the political subtext where its possible that at least some of the revolutionaries may be no better than Snow and his ilk. What happens when and if the powerless become the powerful? How far is too far? Will Katniss continue to shoot her arrows for good?Francis Lawrence who directed the last two ""Hunger Games"" films keeps things moving quickly even though the film runs more than two hours. There are some awkward moments -- the inclusion of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as the renegade gamemaker Plutarch might take some viewers out of the story -- but they are overwhelmed by the movies momentum.Assuming this is the last time Katniss has to strike blows against the empire The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 is a good way to retire.

Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Few big movie franchises are very smart and few smart ones are very big. The Hunger Games series which concludes with the thorny new Mockingjay -- Part 2 has left its mark by striking a balance between heft -- brain food if not brain surgery -- and spectacle with a  healthy dose of moral ambiguity on the side.The fog of war drifts thick in this final chapter which finds the lines between the revolutionary and the reactionary growing impressively blurry. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) the hope and symbol of the rebellion had made it far enough to harbor ambitions of assassinating President Snow (Donald Sutherland still oozing charming malevolence). But her team  sent to the Capitol is tasked with propaganda not combat. Its a sign of the Hunger Games savvy and ambition that the films -- especially the last two -- acknowledge that revolutions must be not only fought but also sold.And sometimes they might not be as noble as they first appear. The old line from the Who about the new boss being the same as the old boss applies pretty well. This means the rebel leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) might not have the public interest at heart. To put it in terms more relatable to recent history regime change can be a drag. Thankfully the Hunger Games finale is not. It helps a great deal to have seen the first chapter (the story covered in the two movies takes up but one book) especially if you find yourself wondering why Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is acting so odd. Part 2 throws you right into the mix where Part 1 left off almost to the extent of finishing the last scene of the last movie before the title credits come on. Wes Chatham and Evan Ross on getting down and dirty in The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 Theres still a love triangle between Katniss Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth) though romance takes a distant backseat to guerrilla warfare and the arduous task of winning hearts and minds. Katniss and her fellow propagandists find themselves advancing through desolate colorless urban streets dodging traps created by game makers and enacting a power struggle within their own ranks. Theres an onslaught of black sludge and a harrowing stretch through the Capitol sewer system. The film balances action and suspense with the kind of political and military gamesmanship that would be at home in a Shakespeare history play (minus the lush language of course).Some of the mainstays from previous installments including Woody Harrelsons Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks Effie work the fringes of the finale. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman died before filming was completed but the relatively minimal presence of his character the head game maker-turned-rebel wise man Plutarch Heavensbee is deftly managed.Its a sign of the movies strength that we see Hoffman not as an eerie ghost but another cog in a well-oiled machine. It seems the wheels of war keep turning round no matter whos in charge. The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 (B+)Directed by Francis Lawrence.

They dont sink all that money into a franchise-capping picture expected to dominate the global box office for weeks without pursuing a certain degree of technical excellence and ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" is no exception. Director Francis Lawrences concluding episode in the four-film series adapted from Suzanne Collins young-adult bestsellers is a suitably handsome and brooding wide-screen spectacle with a modernist-industrial production design that reflects the influence of various 20th-century art movements.But its also true that toward the end of a big series the story eats the stars and everybody in this movie even Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen the Artemis-style revolutionary icon is pretty much part of the furniture. As the rebel alliance of the long-oppressed districts closes in on the decadent Capital of Panem (basically the post-apocalyptic United States) where the aging and tyrannical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) makes his last stand Katniss is sent in behind the invading army - not to fight but to make propaganda films. Which is funny right? Because see were actually watching her in a movie OK you got that part. And ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" is itself a kind of propaganda film. But propaganda for what? There my friends is the rub.Well come back to that. As for the story Francis Lawrence tells (he is Austrian and no relation to Jennifer Lawrence but dude thats confusing; change your name or something) - well its way more obviously about the Bolshevik Revolution and/or Edmund Burkes critique of the French Revolution than any of the ""Hunger Games"" narrative up till now. No wait dammit -- I said we were coming back to that. What I meant to say is that this movie jams in almost every detail from the second half of Collins final novel which I guess is not surprising since screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong worked from an adaptation by Collins herself. ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" drops us right into the middle of the action and is often tense and exciting - theres no point seeing this if you dont know the previous films or the books - but that overstuffed narrative eventually gives the film a dogged draggy feeling the director cannot entirely solve. At 137 minutes this is the second shortest of the ""Hunger Games"" films but it plays longer than either of the previous two entries.I think the central problem of the ""Hunger Games"" fictional universe is closely related to the sheer ingenuity of its construction. First Collins and then the filmmakers have dragged in every possible reference from apocalyptic science-fiction and Y.A. fantasy and classic cinema so that the end result however excitingly paced and capably delivered feels boxed in and overdetermined. I mean take your pick This movie is a little bit ""Star Wars"" and a little bit ""The Running Man"" or maybe its the love child of a three-way between ""The Giver"" ""The Matrix"" and ""A Wrinkle in Time."" When we turn to the real world and actual history Collins inventiveness assumes an even more intriguing cast. As I have said in previous reviews of this series her particular brilliance lies in writing books that already felt like movies and also in her ambiguous positioning of Katniss and her rebellion against the sadistic caste-divided regime of President Snow and the Hunger Games. Its an anti-elite revolution but of what kind?Ive gotten impassioned emails from Tea Partyers after every one of these movies arguing that Collins is on their side and that Katniss stands for individual freedom and self-government standing up against the effeminate totalitarian aesthetes of the Capital. Liberals or leftists are of course free to view the ""Hunger Games"" universe as an Orwellian deep future ruled by the Koch brothers (big supporters of the arts) in which the arrogance of the 1-percenters finally pushes the enslaved masses too far. I make no argument about whos right - in case you hadnt noticed this is fiction and everybody gets to be right. My point is that Collins deliberately avoids picking sides or clarifying the picture until its too late and in the final chapter winds up ticking ""All of the Above"" and delivering a series of highly familiar nostrums. Did you know that power corrupts and absolute power blah blah blah? Did you know that violence begets violence that revolutionary regimes often outdo the savagery of the rulers they overthrow and that those who live by the sword something something? Me neither. You Might Also Like As I implied earlier the zealous and monochromatic revolutionary movement led by insane ice-queen Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) easily my favorite character in this series here acquires a distinctly Leninist or even Maoist flavor. Like Bolshevik mastermind Leon Trotsky Alma believes that true revolutionaries dont have the right not to kill people and that any degree of mayhem and terror is more than acceptable if it helps usher in the new era. Katniss role as the star of ""propos"" on the other hand suggests the heroic workers and soldiers hand-picked by Stalin to serve as symbols of the peoples struggle in the Great Patriotic War (aka World War II). I wouldnt accuse Collins of going squishy on President Snow exactly but in Sutherlands masterful portrayal Katniss great nemesis assumes more human dimensions an aging lion who is endlessly impressed by the unquenchable Girl on Fire and who knows his time is just about up. Jennifer Lawrence hasnt lost her mojo as this series has dragged on and remains a magnetic presence every second shes on-screen. But ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" doesnt really give her much to do. Katniss spends much of the film creeping through the sewers of the capital Jean Valjean-style on a mission so secret that everybody knows about it including Snow Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee the Machiavellian gamemaker turned revolutionary played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Hoffmans role was largely completed before he died but for obvious reasons hes not in the movie as much as he might have been. Other characters arguably more interesting than Katniss and her warring boyfriends including Woody Harrelsons Haymitch Jena Malones Johanna and Elizabeth Banks Effie Trinket barely appear at all. Several people we are supposed to care about get eaten by zombies. I didnt know there would be zombies.As for Katniss love triangle with childhood sweetheart Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth) and former Hunger Games partner Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) its more perfunctory than ever at least to my taste despite the delirious level of melodrama. (I will acknowledge that I am not in the key demographic for this movie.) Peeta has been tortured by Snow dosed with tracker-jacker venom and turned into a psychotic killer while Gale becomes Alma Coins leading military strategist and pretty much a war criminal. Smart women foolish choices In its last scenes ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" fizzles out completely but at least two different dictatorships have been overthrown and replaced with - well something else. If history is any guide New Panem will have to fight a civil war to figure out what that other thing is and even that wont settle anything. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Photo Murray Close Lionsgate/Murray Close Image 18 of 18 Hunger Games finale gives viewers their fill of inanity 1 / 18 Back to Gallery Jennifer Lawrence suppresses all of her natural wit vivacity and cynicism and pours everything thats left into playing Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2."" She is anguished. She is tormented. She is full of anxiety and suspicion and she is often very sad. When shes not worried shes crying. Shes as tortured as Liv Ullmann in an Ingmar Bergman movie and the result is a reminder that with weak material its often worse to have a really good actor. The weaknesses just stands out in sharper relief. The concluding installment of the ""Hunger Games"" series is not the insult and embarrassment that the first ""Mockingjay"" was but a person would have to be very young to take it seriously. Indeed one would practically have to be an infant in emotional matters to believe that a woman like Katniss could possibly be attracted to her weenie boyfriend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Shed eat him for lunch. No not even lunch. Hed be a side dish. Peeta is a major object of concern here because as the movie begins he is locked up and strapped to a bed literally foaming at the mouth about how much he hates Katniss. Yes the government has done terrible things to his mind. Even when he gets better hes not completely cured so that at the slightest hint of tension he can suddenly revert to Katniss hatred. Peeta is like some unintentionally funny combination of a starter boyfriend and ""The Manchurian Candidate."" More reviews Secret in Their Eyes -- a tepid but well-acted remake Spotlight Powerful view as press uncovers priests sex abuse Brooklyn vividly captures an Irishwomans journey Trumbo a witty film about a tortured period Aside from her crazy-boyfriend problem things are actually going pretty well in Katniss world. The rebels have the advantage over the evil government and are slowly making advances. If she wanted Katniss could just sit back make propaganda films and wait for her faction to take over but shes too driven to stand still. She decides that she absolutely must be the one to kill the spooky president Snow (Donald Sutherland) and that becomes her mission. By now we know that its mandatory that a ""Hunger Games"" movie must last longer than two hours and so the movie must keep throwing up obstacles in order to stretch things to their proper length. The movie even goes so far as to drag in monster-like creatures that resemble Orcs from ""Lord of the Rings"" movies -- slippery naked beings with no eyes and no hair but lots of teeth. The boring battles and their tortured aftermath -- the roll calls of the noble dead -- the reiterations of the grand purpose -- and the multiple scenes of Katniss hugging people while staring over their shoulders with an expression of perfect misery -- all these can become not just bearable but reasonably amusing if you just allow three words into your mind ""This is funny."" Likewise if you notice Katniss struggling to kill monsters because she is using a cumbersome bow and arrow and not a handgun stop thinking of her as a great heroine and start entertaining the possibility that this is someone whod bring a knife to a gunfight. Maybe Katniss should expand her range of weaponry past the hunter-gatherer stage. Lawrence is an impressive actress so complete in her intelligence that the thought never enters the mind that Katniss might be a dim bulb even though that would explain a lot of her behavior. As it stands Katniss is hard to understand something that Lawrence at isolated moments almost makes interesting as though some unexplainable inner purity drives her. The movie-star thing helps Lawrence too because Katniss is in a sense the movie star of the rebellion and there are moments when you can see her removing herself from the stares of her admirers and retreating to some pristine inner space through an act of will. ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is the last film of Philip Seymour Hoffman who died during filming which I guess means that he went out on a banana peel. But it doesnt feel that way to see him. Here was an actor incapable of a false moment who had a strange gift for finding truth in the midst of the ridiculous and the interesting in the mundane. He appears in only a few brief scenes but hes so magnetic -- what was it about that guy? -- that in those seconds the movie just comes alive. Alas Hoffman didnt live to film his big scene which would have been the most important in the movie. The filmmakers find a workaround but its obvious and only makes us note the loss all the more. Im almost relieved that there will be no more new Philip Seymour Hoffman movies because its no fun having to keep mourning the loss over and over again.

EntertainmentMovies The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 a powerful bleak finale Originally published November 19 2015 at 1205 am Updated November 19 2015 at 234 pm Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2."" (Murray Close) Movie review of ""The Hunger Games Mockinjay -- Part 2"" Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) returns in the final most violent installment of the franchise. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Dystopias dont come much darker than the one found in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2."" Thats literally visually true as significant portions of the picture take place underground in shadowy tunnels swarming with ravening humanoid monsters. The action on the surface occurs in the rubble-filled streets of shattered cities where the ruins of war stretch as far as the eye can see. Movie Review    The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 with Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Woody Harrelson Julianne Moore Philip Seymour Hoffman Donald Sutherland. Directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong. 136 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and action and for some thematic material. Several theaters. And in terms of the emotions of the characters its the midnight of the soul.

Shes now an embittered adult and a warrior with a single purpose left in her life to kill the man responsible for her misery the malignant President Snow (Donald Sutherland) leader of the postapocalyptic republic of Panem. In this and virtually all other aspects ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is ultrafaithful to the Suzanne Collins best-seller from which it is derived. Indeed the movie is practically a transcription of the novel with its situations and large chunks of dialogue lifted directly from the pages of the book. Thats also true for ""Part 1"" released last year. (The screenplays of both are credited to Peter Craig and Danny Strong.) The heart of the story remains the strange triangular relationship between Katniss Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). Gale loves Katniss but she considers him just a good friend. Katniss loves Peeta and has spent the early movies trying to protect him but as a consequence of extensive torture and brainwashing by Snows minions Peeta hates and wants to kill her. Its all very complicated. And thanks to the depth of feeling the three principal actors bring to their performances undeniably powerful. Over the course of these movies the stars have grown into their roles giving them weight and a growing steeliness. Their characters have suffered greatly and the toll their suffering has taken is evident and believable. Director Francis Lawrence who also directed the previous two ""Games"" has developed a grandiose visual style well suited to the story with looming neofascistic architectural cityscapes seeming to oppress the humans in the frame emphasizing the odds against them in their fight. There are few smiles in evidence other than those of Sutherland silky smooth as Katniss quietly taunting nemesis and of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (in his final screen appearance) whose character Plutarch Heavensbee takes quiet delight in creating and exploiting the image of Katniss as the face of the revolution against Snow. The series ends on a bittersweet note with survival the only victory.

Satisfyingly dark fare.Evan Ross (c) Jennifer Lawrence Liam Hemsworth and Sam Claflin in a scene from ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2.""(Photo Lionsgate)Story HighlightsJennifer Lawrence remains the center of the ""Hunger Game"" films and the best thing about themIf only Lawrence and Donald Sutherland who is having a ball had more scenes togetherCritics rating 4 stars out of 5""The Hunger Games"" got off to a slow start.The first of the four films I mean. Yes four; Suzanne Collins wrote only three novels in the young-adult series but like ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" to name a couple of the other license-to-print-money franchises the filmmakers stretched the last book into two movies. Its a greedy move that rarely serves much of a narrative purpose.But the ""Hunger Games"" films have steadily improved and the rising star of Jennifer Lawrence as the central figure in the story certainly hasnt hurt. As it turns out they saved the best for last. ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is a dark film in a dramatically satisfying way.If these were ever kids movies that time has passed though obviously this still will appeal to a younger demographic. But ""Mockingjay"" brings together the threads of class political power greed and oppression through the will of a kick-ass female protagonist. Its grownup stuff handled in a grownup way. Director Francis Lawrence who has been on board for all but the first film trusts the younger members of his audience to keep up.And they will.The Hunger GamesReview Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1Review The Hunger Games Catching FireReview The Hunger Games10 movies to watch now that HG series is finished5 differences between Mockingjay book amp; movieThe movie begins right where the last one left off with Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) sporting nasty bruises on her neck from an attack by Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who of course loved Katniss but tried to kill her because he was brainwashed by the Capitol. This probably sounds pretty dopey if youre checking in for the first time but if youve hung with things this far it will make perfect sense.Katniss and Peeta for the uninitiated both survived the Hunger Games an annual blood sport in which two young people are chosen from 12 districts in a fight to the death with one person left standing. Somehow this keeps peace which doesnt really make sense but its late in the game to worry about that. Anyway Katniss upset the apple cart a couple of times and now shes part of a resistance movement fighting to overthrow the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland having a blast) so that Panem where they all live can be free.Got that? Doesnt matter. What does matter is that Katniss is going after Snow herself to take him out. But first at the behest of President Coin (Julianne Moore) she has to unite all the districts the only hope the rebels have of winning.And heres where it gets interesting.(L-R) Jennifer Lawrence Mahershala Ali and Liam Hemsworth in a scene from ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2."" (Photo Lionsgate)Gale (Liam Hemsworth) Katniss friend from way back also has a thing for Katniss and has up to this point not tried to strangle her which youd think would give him a leg up on the romantic-triangle front but these are complicated times. Hes fighting in the resistance and has adopted as has Coin the sort of by-any-means-necessary attitude the Capitol always had. What price victory then? If you overthrow the monster does it even count if you become a monster yourself?Deep thinking for a dopey dystopian young-adult drama which this no longer is. As Katniss goes semi rogue and heads for the Capitol her trusty friends follow. But Snow knows theyre coming -- hes clever that way -- so traps are set and people are killed and there is always the off chance that Peeta will go nuts and kill his friends which ranks up there with singing ""100 Bottles of Beer on the Wall"" as a travel annoyance.AZCENTRALThe Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsWhat counts above all else here is Lawrence. Her Katniss is haunted wounded scarred no longer sure what shes fighting for is worth it. And yet she fights on. If only she had more scenes with Sutherland. The delight he gives Snow in carrying out various atrocities is priceless; his utterance of the word ""plucked"" at a less-than-key moment is more entertaining than half the crucial action scenes.Not that theyre bad. They arent. But as the franchise has matured theyre no longer the point or at least not the main one. To be sure ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is part of a bigger story. But it makes it a better story one with some heft. Its not how you start its how you finish. And ""Hunger Games"" finishes strong.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Others fared better. The ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" end games satisfyingly wrapped things up even if ""Return of the King"" stuffed in enough endings to fill out the entire series.Now add ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" to that column of good conclusions. The dark blockbuster series which stars the divine Jennifer Lawrence as archery sharpshooter and rebel-yell icon Katniss Everdeen rebounds after the talky anemic place-holder ""Part 1."" (L-R) Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen Mahershala Ali as Boggs and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) ( Murray Close/Lionsgate ) While we still have a right to rant about the studios off-putting cash grab to cleave author Suzanne Collins final volume in her best-selling trilogy in two ""Part 2"" does show off this franchises better side. That said this conclusion suffers the fate of most finales with too many wrap-it-up scenes in its final moments. It also feels stretched out at times. But those are the biggest problems in what will be remembered as a worthy finish to a standout franchise. The ""Hunger Games"" movies launched in 2012 with an upstart named Katniss stepping in for her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) in the government-created ""Hunger Games"" a televised bloodbath that pitted children from different districts in a dystopian future world called Panem against each other in a deadly game of survival. In ensuing chapters Katniss became the thorn in the governments side and an icon for rebellion and change.Advertisement The best part of the entire series has been the fiery and fantastic Lawrence. It was a coup to cast her in the first place and the Oscar winner gives another fierce performance as the troubled tough young woman thrust into the chew-you-up-and-spit-you-out political machinery of a government operated by President Snow (Donald Sutherland smiling evil and having a heyday). (L-R) Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne Sam Claflin as Finnick Odair Evan Ross as Messalla and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2. (Murray Close/Lionsgate) ( Murray Close/Lionsgate ) ""Part 2"" opens as if there had only been a commercial break after the end of ""Part 1."" Katniss is wrestling with the emotional and physical fallout after a brainwashed Peeta (Josh Hutcherson showing more range) tried to kill her. Shes feeling ever more isolated and dealing with the heavy toll of being an icon.Meanwhile the rebellion is turning into a casualty-ridden war. Drafting the blueprints for the movement are District 13 President Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and ""Hunger Games"" master builder Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman reminding us why he is so missed). After a startling move that leaves some dead the mythic Mockingjay -- Katniss -- visits the tense District 2 which has a solid base of support for Snow. After a showdown there Coin and company send the most high-profile (and attractive) rebellion members to advance on the Capitol.The operation is commanded by the stalwart Boggs (Oaklands Mahershala Ali who ranks ever high in the charisma department). Some of the more notable others in the group include familiar faces such as Katniss soldier boy Gale (Liam Hemsworth showing more depth here as does his character) hunky Games survivor Finnick (Sam Claflin) and the sometimes rage-fueled Peeta a curious addition to the team given his unstable state.Katniss of course has one goal in mind to kill Snow.Collins novel (adapted by Danny Strong and Peter Craig) throws in booby traps galore as the squad tiptoes through a minefield of hot spots. It all recalls the Games themselves as the group encounters subterranean entities bombs massive guns -- you name it -- all executed in a fashion that will have you fearing for the fate of well-loved characters in a series noted for unexpectedly plucking them off.Nearly everything about this finale improves on the last dubious entry. Screenwriters Strong and Craig ditch the propaganda speechifying that bogged down the previous film while returning director Francis Lawrence doesnt allow Collins pointed cynicism about political leaders to overshadow the fast-paced and exciting action sequences. Theres a good balance between smart politically charged dialogue and thrilling action set pieces throughout.And while some of the favorite characters in the series -- the flighty Effie (Elizabeth Banks) the boozy Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and the snarky Johanna (Jena Malone) -- are relegated to the sidelines they are still pivotal to the plot developments.The best entry remains the gripping ""Hunger Games Catching Fire"" but ""Mockingjay Part 2"" is a memorable one-two punch by team Lawrence -- Jennifer and Francis -- that is true to Collins blueprint and elevates the excitement with timely and powerful political overtones.The Games might be over but lets hope new chapters come soon in the form of more blockbuster franchises anchored by a strong female action hero played by an actress of the caliber of Lawrence.THE HUNGER GAMES MOCKINGJAY -- PART 2    Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of violence and action some thematic material)Cast Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth Woody Harrelson Philip Seymour Hoffman Sam Claflin Donald Sutherland Mahershala AliDirector Francis LawrenceRunning time 2 hours 17 minutesWhere Opens Friday at area theatersPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

Even for the closing entry in a series about children killing children in televised death matches The Hunger Games Mockingjay--Part 2 goes heavy on the gloom and doom. This is a movie that begins with its main character the anguished archer Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) nursing wounds inflicted by her brain-washed lover Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and ends with someone explaining to a baby why the nightmares will never stop. Gone is the costume-ball pageantry that used to brighten the corners of Panem. Even Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci once the preening clowns of this dystopian universe cant crack a smile. In fact the only real humor is of the gallows variety provided by Donald Sutherland injecting some crooked levity into his role as the big bad. Awash in a depressive shade of perpetual blue Mockingjay--Part 2 out-Nolans Christopher Nolan in the race to see just how dark a PG-13 tentpole can get before the audience itself revolts.Theres an integrity to this blanket bleakness It would have felt false and even cowardly had Suzanne Collins chosen to complete her bestselling YA saga with an upswing of optimism too bright of a light at the end of the tunnel. Still plenty of casual Hunger Games fans--those without a hashtag in the Gale and Peeta contest for instance--may miss the funhouse-mirror reality-TV satire that enlivened all three of the previous films. Mockingjay--Part 2 is all business its plot moving like a lit fuse burning everything in pursuit of an apocalyptic endgame. Theres no time for outlandish talk-show appearances backstage coaching sessions or tweaks to the uniform. The revolution awaits.If Part 1 suffered from a sense of anti-climax the inevitable byproduct of adapting only half a novel Part 2 is all climax--two hours and 17 minutes of falling action emphasis on the action. The film practically commences mid-conversation with unapologetic abruptness and without any ""previously on"" exposition. (Maybe this is for the best; anyone going to see a movie with a subtitle and a Part Two affixed to its title knows that theyre paying to see the second half of a story theyve already started.) Tired of being the face of the rebellion of posing for a camera while the people who idolize her die in battle Katniss sneaks off to the frontline. Here in an attempt to keep her poster child alive resistance leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) places our heroine on an all-star brigade whose mission is to shoot propaganda footage of their (staged) travails not to actually lead the charge. But Katniss has other ideas and soon the group is en route to President Snow (Sutherland) crossing an urban wasteland to put an arrow in his black heart.This was clearly Collins way of getting one more Hunger Games out of her Hunger Games of putting Katniss back in the heat of life-and-death conflict. The film turns the futuristic Capitol into a new arena bombarding its assassination team with flame-thrower booby traps a sticky tsunami of black tar and subterranean monsters straight out of The Descent. The dirty secret of this franchise is that its action scenes have always been more perfunctory than exciting; the last movie didnt hurt at all from a lack of Games. This Mockingjay expands the death-match portion of the formula to feature length which would be less detrimental if the company were better. But beyond a few stern faces old and new (including Natalie Dormer one of a couple castmates on loan from Westeros) the hit squad is basically just Katniss surly boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and work husband Peeta--though the last participant of that love-triangle at least gains a little internal conflict the product of his reprogramming at the hands of Snow. What a viewer wouldnt give for more of the personality of Banks and Tucci Woody Harrelson or the late Philip Seymour Hoffman all of whose supporting characters are scuttled off to the sidelines to watch and wait. Monolithic in its moroseness Mockingjay--Part 2 bleaches some of the color (literal and figurative) out of Collins world. But theres still a self-awareness--a sly subversive bent--to its blockbuster mechanics. Katniss who just wants to die ""for a cause not a spectacle"" remains a pawn for both sides of the conflict and the film shrewdly complicates the down-with-the-man politics of its predecessor by showing how even Coin the supposedly righteous opposition uses and abuses her star soldiers celebrity. As a series The Hunger Games is all about the manipulation of images and this closing chapter takes that idea to its damning logical conclusion. It also pokes a little fun at its own conventions letting irreverent fellow Games champion Johanna Mason (Jena Malone who deserves more screen time) denounce Katniss for her ""tacky romance"" and nonstop pouting. Apologies to Lawrence whose steeliness has an appeal but imagine what this trilogy--or fine pentalogy--would look like with Malones troublemaking antiheroine at its center.""No one who supports The Capitol is innocent"" Gale somberly insists early into the film when Katniss expresses concern for the bystanders who might die during one of their strategic assaults. Ends justifying means the innocence of civilians the morality of killing those who silently passively condone an oppressive society--seeing characters debate these topical topics is more uncomfortable this week than it would have been last week. But its that very willingness to wade into murky waters however diplomatically that puts the series a notch above the average Hollywood franchise and helps redeem the one-note broodiness of this bifurcated finale. As The Hunger Games winds inexorably towards its downbeat conclusion with the threat of a regime change that wont change anything one cant help but feel faintly grateful for the attempt (any attempt) to tackle real problems in the context of a four-quadrant entertainment--even if as always Katniss solves them with little more than a well-aimed arrow.

In theaters Nov. 20. (Credit Lionsgate) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Dystopian rebel Katniss Everdeen brings her revolution to the steps of the Capitol. Rated PG-13 (some strong violence). BOTTOM LINE The once-energetic franchise peters out with this disappointing finale. CAST Jennifer Lawrence Josh Hutcherson Liam Hemsworth LENGTH 216 Three years after launching Jennifer Lawrence to superstardom and sparking a craze for young-adult stories set in violent dystopias ""The Hunger Games"" comes to an end this week with ""Mockingjay - Part 2."" Like Lawrences reluctant heroine Katniss Everdeen this franchise has been feeling overtaxed groaning under the pressure to deliver on the promise of Suzanne Collins acclaimed novels and the well-received first film in 2012. With ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" the once-energetic series crawls to a finish. It isnt Lawrences fault. Her Katniss still has the steel spine and survivors instincts that endeared her to us when she first won The Hunger Games a blood sport staged by the despotic President Snow (Donald Sutherland delectably evil as ever). As the series progressed however Katniss devolved from a futuristic Diana -- a regal warrior with a lethal bow and arrow -- to a pouty put-upon figure constantly bemoaning her burden as the poster-child for a rebellion led by Alma Coin and Plutarch Heavensbee (Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman both very fine). Almost as compensation Katniss is rewarded with two moony-eyed suitors Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). advertisement | advertise on newsday All that waffling-heart business so reminiscent of ""Twilight"" was never convincing partly because it undermines Katniss strong personality and partly because of Hutchersons low-energy presence. The romance grates more than ever here because theres so little else happening. Katniss leads a squad of rebels to assassinate President Snow -- ""He needs to see my eyes when I kill him"" -- and so the movie is mostly a series of marches battles and lulls all staged with a perfunctory feel by director Francis Lawrence. ""Mockingjay - Part 2"" deserves credit for incorporating real-world themes like media manipulation terrorism and power vacuums but its somber-faced hand-wringing treatment can be tough to take seriously. Its the wrong tone for a series that at bottom is still just an entertaining spectacle -- and this movie isnt nearly entertaining enough. The end of an era may have just begun. The dystopian franchises ""Divergent"" and ""The Maze Runner"" are both set to wrap up in 2017 and there are no other obvious players in that game. Speaking of power vacuums ""Star Wars Episode VII - The Force Awakens"" another female-led science-fiction film arrives next month with impeccable timing.

"The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 review Katniss saga comes to an end - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 review Katniss saga comes to an end The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 Murray Close / AP Natalie Dormer as Cressida left and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in a scene from ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2."" Natalie Dormer as Cressida left and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen in a scene from ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2."" (Murray Close / AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune One last arrow in the quiver for Jennifer Lawerence Katniss Everdeen and ""The Hunger Games."" Nothing lasts forever except the ""Hunger Games"" franchise. Yet here we are. Forever is over. ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2"" brings the four-film saga of Katniss Everdeen and her revolutionary war to a dutiful fairly satisfying if undeniably attenuated conclusion.Following the lucrative ""Twilight"" template there was simply too much money at stake here to prevent the third ""Hunger Games"" book in novelist Suzanne Collins trilogy from being halved. Three best-sellers therefore became four features and many additional hundreds of millions of dollars will likely end up in the vault down at Lionsgate Savings amp; Loan. In the first and best ""Hunger Games"" film four years ago Jennifer Lawrence was like Peggy Sawyer the Allentown Pa. hoofer in ""42nd Street."" With bow arrow and hawklike gaze of destiny she went out there a youngster but she had to come back a star and she did. Put another way Lawrence brought home the bacon and fried it up in a pan. In ""Mockingjay 2"" its more a case of her saving the movies bacon period.What can be said about the wrap-up? Mainly its dark. Lawrences Katniss out to assassinate the heartless yet elegant President Snow (Donald Sutherland) spends many brooding minutes of screen time in literal shadow. Accompanied by her best fellas the brainwashed-but-feeling-better Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and hows-my-hair huntsman Gale (Liam Hemsworth) Katniss mucks around in one subterranean low-lighting setting after another. Then at one point thanks to some pretty slick computer-generated imagery she mucks around in a big hurry as she and her fellow freedom fighters elude a rising tide of sloshing flooding black oil. The only reliable source of light in ""Mockingjay 2"" appears to be Sutherlands beard. The fascist Snow promises ""a celebration of suffering"" for Katniss and her ilk and for better or worse the ""Hunger Games"" saga has always taken the plight of its sufferers just seriously enough to make it stick. I go back to the very first sentence I wrote on these movies four years ago ""The hypocrisy at the heart of The Hunger Games is irresistible."" Collins knew that if she invented a wide enough variety of ways to die all shed need is a compelling conduit to decry the brutality. Poof Ms. Everdeen the savior the myth the legend. The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 trailer The official trailer for ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" is titled ""For Prim."" The official trailer for ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" is titled ""For Prim."" See more videos In ""Mockingjay 2"" which takes its time in the telling because theres not a lot of story to tell Katniss shakes the numb funk of ""Mockingjay 1"" and resolves to end this thing. Its peculiar and sad to see the late Philip Seymour Hoffman appear in abbreviated handfuls of scenes as the games designer turned revolutionary. Stanley Tucci meantime comes back for a single bit seconds in length. Yet he manages to end his brief appearance with the single most insincere smile his toady of a character has ever smiled. Bravo maestro Tucci.And you know what? Two-and-a-half-cheers to this franchise. ""The Hunger Games"" has completed its tasks well and met fan expectations. Now Lawrence can move on to the next stage of a career made financially possible by that three-fingered salute to the Mockingjay and all for which it stands. ""Mockingjay 2"" ends with a coda so fraudulent-looking and sticky-sweet you wait for the moment when Katniss wakes up from her Lasse Hallstrom nightmare. But that sort of cynicism has no place in Panem or in dystopian Young Adult literature as a whole. The more unstable the real world grows the more young readers and their unashamed elders lap up stories at once dour and stirring about life after the apocalypse.

VPCCressida (Natalie Dormer left) and Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) in franchise closer ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2.""(Photo Murray Close Lionsgate)Games are over and Katniss Everdeen really means business now.After surviving two battle-to-the-death films and one movie mostly about making propaganda material Jennifer Lawrences ace archer is in for one more fight for her life in The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) the explosively uneven finale to the successful movie franchise. It has the best action sequences of all four chapters though its revolutionary message gets bogged down by a meandering plot and some good old-fashioned overacting.With Francis Lawrence back as director for the third time the grand finale picks up immediately from the first Mockingjay though thats its first mistake Katniss and the rebellious folks of District 13 have just rescued Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) a District 12 Hunger Games victor along with Katniss though he has been brainwashed into thinking Katniss is a total monster and has to claw his way back from the brink of madness.USA TODAYHunger Games stars take their final bow with Mockingjay Part 2A good 30 minutes is just continuing the story of the last movie until the rebels plan against the Capitol of Panem -- think the one percent crossed with the Empire from Star Wars and the most avant-garde day of New York Fashion Week -- starts to come together. After taking down a strategically important fortress at District 2 the march begins on the oppressive Capitol under the behest of resistance leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) though the new battleground is a danger zone of booby traps and killer obstacles. Katniss Peeta and rebel soldier/Katniss childhood BFF Gale (Liam Hemsworth in the three-spot of the love triangle) are part of an all-star unit thats to be filmed to keep up morale back home though Katniss has a different plan Assassinate the evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland) who has some internal problems of his own.Everybodys got issues and because the cast is so huge that means a lot of drama to go around. Seeing Philip Seymour Hoffman one more time as rebel commander Plutarch Heavensbee is bittersweet. Gwendoline Christie has a blink-and-youll-miss it role as District 2 honcho Commander Lyme and her Game of Thrones co-star Natalie Dormer is back as Panems coolest filmmaker Cressida. But best of all Jena Malone has another chance to bring slightly mad Johanna Mason to bonkers life.Juggling all those characters tends to slow down the whole show. Its only in a few of the more exceptional set pieces -- where Katniss and crew have to survive a tidal wave of deadly oil an underground attack by blind humanoid beasties and bombs away on a crowd of people in the Capitol -- where Mockingjay kicks into a nice gear.USA TODAYThe Hunger Games legacy Its Jennifer Lawrences world nowAfter the previous movie had her heroine in PTSD mode Lawrence gets to stretch her acting chops in the Hunger Games climax. The Katniss/Peeta/Gale dynamic finally works itself out and cleverly in one sequence where the two dudes devise a bro code. But nobody is helped by Danny Strong and Peter Craigs script which offers clunky arena metaphors and corny dialogue like ""Its war Katniss. War isnt always personal.""The last two films are poorly edited and chock-full of filler such as lingering close-ups of Elizabeth Banks weird and wild eyelashes as oddball fashion plate Effie Trinket. Theres something to be said about the financial boon of a pair of Mockingjay films that clock in at more than four hours together though from a filmmaking standpoint theres a single really good 21/2-hour movie in there. What also doesnt help is trying to have more endings than TheLord of the Rings The Return of the King -- four arent needed when just one good one will do.Every journey has to come to a close at some point and while its not a perfect exit for Katniss its one where she gets to put her bow arrow and big heart to good use. 221 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1j7AcPQ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/11/18/hunger-games-mockingjay-part-2-movie-review/75964056/,200,thehungergamesmockingjay-part232,thehungergamesmockingjay-part2,usatoday

(Murray Close) BY Stephen Whitty NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 18 2015 714 AM Title The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 Film Info With Jennifer Lawrence Liam Hemsworth Josh Hutcherson. Franchise fans finally get their fill as Jennifer Lawrence leads a revolt. Director Francis Lawrence. (216). PG-13 Violence. Area Theaters. Remember that line from the first ""Hunger Games"" film ""May the odds be ever in your favor""? Yeah well that luck has run out. Maze-running guys divergent gals -- the world of depressing young-adult sci-fi movies is getting as crazy and crowded as a Republican presidential field. So which saga is this again? What makes ""The Hunger Games"" and its heroine so special? Let Johanna its glummest character remind us. JENNIFER LAWRENCE SAYS KATNISS INSPIRED PAY GAP COMMENTS ""The whole tacky romantic drama"" Johanna (Jena Malone) sneers at Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) to explain why she cant stand her. ""And the defender-of-the-helpless act."" Oh right. This is that series. 1 photos view gallery The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 World Premiere If you remember the last three movies -- well then you were really paying attention. Lets just say that at this point former teen gladiator J-Law is leading a rebellion against nasty old dictator President Snow (Donald Sutherland). But just as the old empire is crumbling Katniss is beginning to wonder if new leader Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) is going to be any better. Lawrence works hard but the movies pace is haphazard with some major scenes -- the capture of an armory the arrival at the capital the death of several beloved characters -- rushing by. Yet other scenes drag on forever. EXCLUSIVE FIRST LOOK AT HUNGER GAMES EXHIBIT IN TIMES SQUARE Even as Lawrence keeps up that ""whole tacky romantic drama"" -- will she choose Gale (Liam Hemsworth) or Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and do you really care? -- only towards the end does she become the ""defender-of-the-helpless"" shes supposed to be grabbing her bow and hitting some action-movie bullseyes. Except its not really the end and the movie still has four or five dull scenes to go. Manipulate much? Elizabeth Banks and Jennifer Lawrence act out a scene in the ""Hunger Games"" finale. (Murray Close) Give Lawrence credit for a seriously emotional performance at least and thanks to supporting actors Moore Sutherland and a sly Woody Harrelson for adding color and comedy. And give director Francis Lawrence props too for deftly handling the premature death of Philip Seymour Hoffman rescuing his unfinished performance as Plutarch Heavensbee with some quick closeups and at least one re-cast scene. And genre fans will love one sequence where our heroes are attacked by pasty monsters in the sewers. Its scary and frantic and everything this whole movie should be. And isnt. Of course the truly devoted may still be moved to watch this epic finally come to a close. I even heard a few sniffles at an early screening. But for the rest of us? Its strictly from hunger.

The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 (PG-13) The last chapter in the dystopian sci-fi series starring Jennifer Lawrence comes to a satisfying bittersweet end. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/10/2015 Editor rating 3 Grim relentless and immensely satisfying The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 sends out the dystopian sci-fi franchise on a feel-bad high. Readers of Suzanne Collins source novel who already know whats coming will be pleased by the movies merciless fidelity to the source material (or perhaps considering the book is the least popular in the trilogy will just be annoyed all over again). For the rest of us who only know The Hunger Games through its wildly uneven movies Mockingjay - Part 2 is proof that there really was more going on here all along than derivative allegories shallow cultural commentary and trite young-adult angst. Filmmaker Francis Lawrence who has gradually deepened the series over the last three installments (and made you forget the chintzy first picture directed by Gary Ross) doesnt forget the somber aura that has seeped into the films hinting at grave things to come. Civil war and fascism arent subjects you can wrap up with a shiny bow and glitter. Even a presumably happy ending would bear melancholy footnotes which is the case here. By now the story has grown so complicated that Lawrence doesnt try to help newcomers catch up. Mockingjay - Part 2 picks up where the previous movie left off Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) has been rescued from the clutches of the tyrannical President Snow (Donald Sutherland) but is brainwashed to fight against Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and the rest of the underground rebels. Finnick (Sam Claflin) is preparing to wed. Johanna (Jena Malone) is still fronting. President Coin (Julianne Moore) the leader of the rebellion and her assistant Plutarch (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman who died during production) debate Katnisss value as a symbol. She may be worth more as a martyr now. The bulk of Mockingjay - Part 2 is a war movie albeit on an intimate scale with a small group of soldiers trying to achieve an impossible military mission beset by enemies in the form of monsters (extremely well rendered with a mixture of real actors and CGI) and less describable things such as a giant wave of black goo that seems to be alive. Their objective is simple - take Snow down - and Katniss armed with her iconic bow and arrow finds new uses for her versatile weapon. The heroes suffer big losses as all soldiers in wars must. But the movie never generates the rush of a straightforward action picture A sense of dread permeates the film a feeling that this story may not be as predictable as it appears. Despite the series monumental success The Hunger Games hasnt penetrated popular culture the way superheroes or even Twilight did. Yes you can buy a Katniss action figure and Mockingjay - Part 2 wisely keeps the character at its center even as the world is falling down around her. But who would ever want to pretend to be her? The casting of Lawrence as the anchor of this franchise now seems like a stroke of prescient genius - her talent has blossomed and matured in ways no one could have predicted - and the sagas final chapter brings the focus back to her reminding us of everything Katniss has lost and suffered as a result of trying to protect her younger sister in the first installment. She gets a lovely bittersweet send-off and the actress makes us believe in all the pain and experience etched across her face - the toll of an unwitting warrior tasked with saving the world. When Lionsgate announced they would be splitting Mockingjay in two the move felt like a cash grab. But after seeing the new movie the decision makes sense. Mockingjay - Part 2 really is just that The second half of the film you started watching last year. Here is your reward for having stuck with The Hunger Games. Be careful what you wish for.

TWITTER Jennifer Lawrence is back as heroine Katniss Everdeen in the final film adapted from Suzanne Collins blockbuster book trilogy. ""It gets a little tedious after all these years"" admits Katniss Everdeen about her lifes obligations in her final line of dialogue after 547 accumulated minutes of The Hunger Games films. Its hard not to agree with her nor to imagine that there are too many people -- Jennifer Lawrence included -- who will be sorry to see this overdrawn series end. Not too many that is except for the folks at Lionsgate who have tallied 2.315 billion in worldwide box-office grosses from their three previous adaptations of Suzanne Collins blockbuster book trilogy and can count on raking in another 800 million give or take from this pervasively grim final edition to the series. But this cash cow is done. What started off onscreen as a lush outdoorsy futuristic gladiatorial adventure has to close things out become a dark often stifling tale of rebel insurrection that takes place largely underground or in dangerous urban ruins. Nominally fueled by accelerating anticipation of the long-awaited showdown between Katniss and nefarious President Snow (Donald Sutherland) The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 accentuates the weariness of the original insurgents and wariness between the archer warrior and rebel leader Coin (Julianne Moore) who is far ahead of her cohorts in imagining a post-Snow Panem nation. In fact Collins most surprising and satisfying achievement in the series third installment was her handling of Coin whose profile as a peoples champion against an oppressive tyrannical regime is increasingly contaminated by totalitarian impulses of her own and crafty ploys aimed at reducing Katniss to a mere figurehead for the revolutionary movement. This element is similarly the most engaging aspect of the latest film and while it doesnt really occupy much screen time it provides a dramatically arresting action climax. Still this is a dish that has been simmering over low heat for a long time which makes for some pretty slow-going early on. Contributing most to the early sense of stasis is Josh Hutchersons Peeta who since his liberation after being brainwashed by Capitol forces must be strapped down while he babbles threatening diatribes against Katniss. She believes he can be brought around but even as he improves he continues to be a loose cannon. Read more Mockingjay -- Part 2 Final Trailer The Franchise Will Come to Explosive Close The members of Coins inner circle seem well down the path to becoming mere yes-men and here it must be noted that Mock 2 marks the final film appearance of Philip Seymour Hoffman who died last year before completing his role as Plutarch Heavensbee a former Snow ally now serving as Coins right hand. He has very little to do here (also the case for Jeffrey Wright as another adviser) and its hard to tell if digital sleight-of-hand is at work in any of his scenes or whether his lines were spoken by him or finessed by other means. Whatever the case this great actor goes out with a whimper rather than a bang. Even if Coin would prefer that Katniss stay behind to serve as a symbol rather than join the front lines of battle the young warrior is utterly determined to kill Snow herself and shortly sets out with a little band of commandos that not only includes Peeta but Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who still doesnt know quite where he stands with her Haymitch (Woody Harrelson now with mere scraps of dialogue) little sister Prim (Willow Shields) Finnick (Sam Claflin) damaged Johanna (Jena Malone) camera-toting Cressida (Natalie Dormer) squad leader Boggs (Mahershala Ali) and others. Once the squad emerges from a long initial spell underground a videogame vibe takes over as the group pushes through the largely vacated Capitol toward Snows palace. The rebels scope reveals the whereabouts of countless ""pods"" that have been hidden throughout the city and will explode or set off other nasty reactions when approached. But many new pods continue to be added in unknown locations that quite efficiently reduce the commandos numbers. But Katniss will not be deterred not after all shes been through and at least the climax has been handled adeptly so that fans will be pleased and those who have never read the book might actually be taken by surprise. The Katniss we behold in the epilogue set a few years later is unquestionably an older wiser person -- and gratefully retired from public life. Read more The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 New Trailer Focuses on Katniss and Prims Bond Looking back and beyond the financial tsunami it created The Hunger Games stands as a franchise that benefited equally from smarts good fortune and arriving at a favorable moment in the zeitgeist one that featured a young action heroine who could be embraced as a (reluctant) feminist fantasy figure. Anyone could have seen the vast cinematic potential in the story of a rural teenage girl plucked from her poor simple life thrust into repeated life-and-death survival competitions only to emerge as a star and finally becoming not only a symbol but an instrument of political revolution against a totalitarian regime. A bit of a bump ensued when the first entrys director and co-writer Gary Ross evidently couldnt or wouldnt commit to turning out scripts fast enough to ensure the annual release rate Lionsgate desired but a consistent reliable if uninspired replacement was found in Francis Lawrence. Although evidently not in the overbearing manner of EL James on the Fifty Shades of Grey movie novelist Collins maintained involvement and input (she received an unusual ""adaptation"" screenwriting credit on the final two installments) and good writers were hired to do solid carpentry which they did. Aesthetic consistency was maintained by production designer Philip Messina and composer James Newton Howard working on all four films; after cinematographer Tom Stern left along with Ross Jo Willems shot all of Lawrences installments. Read more The Hunger Games Mockingjay -- Part 2 Sets China Release Date Even if the illustrious supporting players were just punching the clock much of the time almost all of them -- Harrelson Stanley Tucci Elizabeth Banks Moore Wright and yes even Hoffman when his characters allegiances shifted -- had their bust-out moments somewhere along the line. And then theres Sutherland who after exuding pestilential inhumanity and condescension for three and a half films saves the best for last; even in the face of his unquestioned demise he can only regard the upstart Katniss with a look of amused disdain followed by profound ironic laughter that echoes Walter Hustons at the end of The Treasure of the Sierra Madre; in fact the moment is cut too short. But all of the above factors mean little or nothing compared to the importance of Jennifer Lawrence having emerged as a star in this series. Just 21 when the first entry was released and an Academy Award winner by the time the second came out Lawrence is one of those rare performers who has it all talent looks spirit emotional accessibility and a spontaneous quality that helps every scene shes in come alive. Those who recognized this and saw that she could elevate The Hunger Games from mass market teen pulp to event status earned whatever they got -- which is a lot. Now that this series is over Lawrence is theoretically free to do twice as many non-franchise films as she has over the past four years which means shell be able to work with directors other than Lawrence and David O. Russell. The line forms on the left.

A rousing cheer and we all go home satisfied. Except that Mockingjay - Part 2 isnt that movie. This might be the most downbeat blockbuster in memory a film that starts out pitiless and goes downhill from there save for a fleeting glimmer of hope in the final moments. Its a bold statement about the unforgiving nature of war unashamedly political in its motives and quietly devastating in its emotional effect. The action picks up right after the end of Part 1 with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) suffering hallucinations brought on by Snows torturers and Katniss kicking against the restrictions placed on her by rebel leader Coin (Julianne Moore). The first half runs along fairly predictable tramlines as Katniss slips her captors and joins the fray bent on taking Snow down. Theres a truly nightmarish tussle in a sewer tunnel - the series most effective action sequence hands down - and then its on to Snows mansion for the climactic showdown. But just as the end is in sight everything shifts. We wont spoil things except to say that the choices made are truly striking simultaneously reaffirming the series commitment to timely political point-making while providing an off-key but oddly satisfying sense of closure. Some will find the wrongfooting nature of the final scenes off-putting and the pace can be ponderous. But its genuinely powerful thanks in large part to a peerless cast Lawrence has rarely been better and shes matched - unexpectedly - by Hutcherson delivering a peculiarly soulful turn. Stanley Tucci Jena Malone Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks all make the most of their fleeting appearances - theres a brief moment between the latter two which is simply beautiful. But its one other bit-player who makes the biggest impact. This is Philip Seymour Hoffmans final film and though his scenes are few its an oddly fitting heartfelt sad-but-hopeful swansong.

I was dreading how they would actually end the film saga and without Philip Seymour Hoffman (RIP) and I was not disappointed. Great action scenes everythings unraveled as expected. At times it was a bit slow for my taste but overall it hit the right spots for this entertaining saga. Now its over ( oh well ...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016TowersFeaturedIt was entertaining but not as good as the previous films in the series where you were on the edge of your seat in suspense.However the death defying games part was still very creative and well done. Jennifer Lawrence - played her character very well a quietly confident serious and determined survivor waging a war against the oppressive capital. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 9 2016Amy LTastemakerFeaturedIve generally been disappointed with all of the films in the Hunger Games trilogy so not quite sure why I keep going back to see them However I would say that Mockingjay Part 2 was my favourite of the 4. Im not a massive fan of Jennifer Lawrence in it however the action scenes and special effects were certainly impressive. The ending was sickening though - I really wish they had just cut the final scene It wouldnt be at the top of my list of films to go and see at the moment but its certainly an easy enjoyable film to watch.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 29 2015Kishma STastemakerFeaturedMockingjay part 2 is better than part 1 but the bar was set low.That said its entertaing with good action scenes and graphics. I didnt find that 3D added anything to the experience which was a bit of a disappointment. I think the best way to describe this is as a well executed but predictable finish to the trilogy I cant think of one particular bit that stands out above the rest but it provides closure and it was enjoyable.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 21 2015Alexandra LTastemakerFeaturedIn my honest opinion its nigh on impossible to make a film as good as the book it originated from - Id say both parts of Deathly Hallows are a rarity in which the two match - but this task is made all the more arduous when one final book is split into two films especially when there is no reason for it other than pure financial greed and anyone who loves The Hunger Games books would be hard pressed to say that wasnt the case with the last two films. Gripping emotionally exhausting amp; utterly absorbing the books are wonderful and films 1 amp; 2 did an excellent job of bringing them to life. Unfortunately the problem with splitting Mockingjay in half means that some of the pace and desperation is lost. Theres too much time and not enough happening in each part to fill it yet there are key moments that feel rushed and as though theyre not given the screen time they deserve. The action scenes are well constructed and watching it in 3D made me nervous for the mutts long before they appeared on screen which is a feat well accomplished when you know whats coming next. Lawrence is as good as shes been in all previous films with none of the annoying cool girl quirks that mark her out in real life now; you believe her and you root for her and you feel for her which lets face it is pretty important for a lead character. It is however the older generation whom you cannot take your eyes from with Donald Sutherland being sincerely splendid as the assured-at-all-times Snow and Elizabeth Banks continuing to shine despite Effies limited screen time. Love triangle components Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson are both perfectly fine though they hardly set the screen alight with the passion rage amp; sorrow depicted in Suzanne Collins books.The movie is beautifully scored and the scenes in the last 20 minutes are moving in their simplicity although the coda was nowhere near as powerful as it reads in the book. It felt like an add on an afterthought if you will which is an impression never given on the pages. Its still a film absolutely worth seeing because sometimes you get so caught up in the people you read about you can almost forgive any flaws in their on-screen incarnations but theres no doubt this would have been a stronger and more impactful film in one sitting and I was sad when the credits rolled on my time within the world Id grown to love.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Emma SFeaturedEnjoyable? Sure... Fast paced and gripping? Satisfyingly so... Award winning performances? Probably not but they did the job... Will I remember this film in years to come? No. Having excitedly waited a whole year for the final Hunger Games film to come out it was a bit of a let down. Im not one to hate on films Ill happily watch the worst of them but the ending was quite simply dull. Im all in favour of cheese but this just stripped the entire franchise of everything I believed it to stand for. My final thoughts were Really? Thats how they decided to end it? and I guess thats all Ill remember in years to come.So all in all you might as well see it on a big screen is probably better but you wont leave thinking anything more than - it was okay. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Carly-Ann ClementsStaff WriterFeaturedIm so pleased I wasnt deterred by the disappointing Part One because the last action-packed installment of The Hunger Games series really delivered. Bringing what should have been a trilogy of films to a massive climactic end Part Two managers to visualise the horrific events of the book effectively giving you the emotional punch in the stomach required as well as the epic action scenes.Its not art its not groundbreaking but its entertaining and Id happily watch it again.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Eneko MFeaturedIt took a while but the unnecessary second part of the worst book of the trilogy got out and the story was closed. I only went to watch it because I had read the books and watched all the previous films so I didnt want to be left half way. However the film just simply is not good. Its inaccurate at parts and makes it obvious how unnecessary it was to split an already boring book in two films.No clear explanation is left about what happens at the end of the film and why it was like that. And not only is the storytelling weak. The acting is nowhere near the level of some of the actors. Its as though they didnt care too much about the film itself.It an OK film and thats it. Only worth if youve watched the previous films already. But if you havent dont even bother and go straight to the books. Theyre not legendary prose but at least youll be entertained and get the whole story.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015Daniel HFeaturedIll preface this by saying that Ive not read the books so I am unable to judge it in that context but I have seen all the other films.I felt that this was one of the strongest in this series of films the previous 2 I have felt a bit more ambivalent about but I enjoyed this one. The whole concept of it being a war of propaganda is explored much more strongly here and some reservations I have had about certain characters have been borne out. Trying not to give to much about the ending away I was also pleased at how it explores the initial consequences of revolutions generally and felt that it did so very well.My complaints would be that the ending is a bit predictable (although fairly good even despite that) and the romantic drama a bit heavy handed but I also realise that I am not the primary target audience for this. I also would have liked it to end just a little bit earlier as there were some scenes that I felt were unnecessary.Over all I would recommend this film.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 30 2015Corina BTastemakerFeaturedThe film was nothing short of what was expected of it it was just as exciting as the rest of the movies and overall if you enjoyed the other three you should enjoy this one. The films action and special effects are very well made. As a fan of the books I was not disappointed at all some people disapproved of the ending and called it too boring I disagree as I feel a slow ending is exactly what such an action packed set of movies needed. Definitely worth the money. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 29 2015Sarah GTastemakerFeaturedPopped along to Clapham Picturehouse with my eldest (12 yrs) daughter yesterday. Was thoroughly gripped throughout. At time felt positively sick with anticipation. The film captures perfectly the excitement amp; adventure if the books as well as the genuine moral dilemmas faced by those who fight corruption amp; dictatorship. The effects were tremendous it was almost like being on a rideHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 29 2015Tara PTastemakerFeaturedA big fan of the Hunger Games series of books and films I approached the final installment with some trepidation. The third film had made me lose my faith somewhat as they cynically stretched the final book into a drawn-out two film finale. I worried that they had lost momentum. My fears were assuaged - somewhat. The action of the fourth film benefited from having more time to explore it. However the film suffered in its faithful retelling of its source material. A core problem of ""Mockingjay"" is that Katniss is reduced to a weak element in a boring love triangle - and the film also focused on this (I assume to cash in on the Team Peeta/Team Gale audiences). The longing looks and the number of false dull kisses did get a bit old and the subtlety of some moments was lost in film as we were not privy to Katnisss reflections. This was also true at the end where we did not witness the nuances of her final reflections. What was lost however was more than made up for in the interpretation of the key action sequences. There were some standout moments - the tunnel scene in particular was adapted spectacularly. The impact of the body count also hit home much harder in film than in text as even the deaths of bit characters are much more impactful when you can actually see them. In all I was happy with what I saw.

Not only for any helpful exposition--Mockingjay Part 2 opens midscene as if the pause button on Part 1 just wore out its one-year warranty--but for the future of all Panems citizens. Our heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is bruised and broken after a vicious assassination attempt by her onetime best friend/fiance/fellow warrior Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) whose mind has been turned to a paranoid 12 Monkeys mush by President Snows shadowy forces. The rebellion is in shambles the Districts are turning on one another and even Snow himself seems diminished; these days poisoning an insubordinate at the dinner table elicits only the thinnest Putin-esque wisp of a smile. But as long as Katniss lives to see another day there are still plans (and franchise dollars) to be made. Once shes recovered enough to strap on her longbow again its decided that she will join an all-star team of Tributes on a march toward the Capitol--more as a propaganda squad than an actual battle unit since theyll be broadcasting their progress from well behind the front lines. The crew soon discovers of course that ""safe zones"" dont really exist Buildings are booby-trapped bullets are real. And in one terrifying sequence a slithering mass of mutants with boiled-frog skin and barracuda teeth attack turning an underground tunnel into a death trap. At this point you might start to wonder how a young-adult audience will handle scenes scary enough to make old adults long for the relative mutant-free safety of The Martian. (Matt Damon may be 50 million miles from home but at least hes alone.) Its a good question and one parents will have to answer at their own discretion. Suzanne Collins source material always fell outside the conventional YA curve--it is after all about kids killing kids for sport--but she also placed her dystopian themes inside a balanced moral universe and gave us a female protagonist who was smart and complicated and thrillingly self-determined. The first two films managed the challenge of visually presenting the books violence without tipping into territory their target demo couldnt handle. Mockingjay though strays too far into darkness With its political power struggles and prodigious body count all rendered in a thousand shades of wintry greige the movie feels less like teen entertainment than a sort of Hunger Games of Thrones. The acting and production values are still well above grade and Lawrence skillfully holds the center letting everything the skeletal dialogue doesnt say play across her face. Like the arrow-slinging empire-saving Joan of Archery shes portraying she understands the symbolic weight shes been asked to carry here. If only it didnt have to hang so heavy.

The political satire is intelligent and trenchant (and it should be noted far wittier than almost anything in ""Our Brand Is Crisis"") the action is thrilling the characters are empathetic and while its taken me three previous movies to get there I find myself getting chills when her fellow rebels give Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) that three-fingered salute of defiance. See Video Jennifer Lawrence Decides to Kill President Snow in New Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 Clip For all of its pulpy thrills ""Mockingjay Part 2"" has a lot to say about the nature of warfare and propaganda the dangers of regime change and the challenges and rewards of rebuilding your life after its been systematically chipped into rubble. That these movies never got completely bogged down by their central love triangle -- even though its handled skillfully and we still care about how its resolved -- is but one of the many achievements of this franchises architects. The men in Katniss life are important yes but theyre not her reason for being. The film begins without so much as a ""Previously on"" montage as we see a close-up of Katniss bruised neck still recovering from the attack by a brainwashed Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). She can barely speak but its important that she regain her voice since District 13 rebel leaders Alma Coin (Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) need the Mockingjay to unite the districts of Panem so that they can jointly overthrow the corrupt dictatorial regime of President Snow (Donald Sutherland). Also Read Jennifer Lawrences Hunger Games Finale on Target for 125 Million Opening SS_D75-23952.dng For Katniss its important that the rebels not stare so long into the abyss that they become what they have beheld; when others callously plan to bury one of Snows underground bases with an avalanche its Katniss who insists that one tunnel be left open so that civilians can escape and soldiers if they choose can surrender. (Not that her idealism is always rewarded -- early on she saves one of those presumably surrendering officers from being shot only to find herself being held at gunpoint by him.) Katniss tries to shake off the propaganda team documenting her every move so that she can go into the Capitol by herself to assassinate Snow but Coin wants Katniss on camera even if that means pretending like Katniss rogue decisions were actually Coins ideas all along. The Capitol itself has been threaded with deadly traps (not to mention the horrifying ""Mutts"" in the sewer) so traversing its streets becomes in the words of Finnick (Sam Claflin) ""the 76th Hunger Games."" Also Read Josh Hutcherson Picks Which Presidential Candidate Would Win The Hunger Games Can Katniss battle monsters without becoming one herself? Will Peeta be able to overcome his torture-induced programming and realize that he loves Katniss? Does Gale (Liam Hemsworth) still have a chance to win her heart? And will Katniss discover that she runs the risk of being more useful as a martyred hero than a surviving one? Readers of the books of which I am not one presumably already know the answers to these and other questions but returning screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong and director Francis Lawrence skillfully interweave political intrigue and deadly obstacles all while still finding time for moments with the characters weve gotten to know over the course of the series. (Theres even room for a little self-mockery as when Johanna (Jena Malone) commandeers a hospitalized Katniss morphine drip and then busts our heroines chops for ""the whole tacky romance drama and [your] defender-of-the-hopeless bit."") Also Read The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2 to Spread Its Wings in China Cinematographer Jo Willems who shot all but the first ""Hunger Games"" movie once again creates vivid contrasts between the bunkers of District 13 the now-ruined grandeur of the Capitol and the rustic beauty of Katniss home in District 12 and he unpacks an impressive 360-cam that whirls around Katniss dancing with her sister Prim (Willow Shields) in a rare moment of calm. The effects team pulls off the Capitols many deathtraps even one that could have looked supremely phony -- it involves an enclosed space filling up with what looks like crude oil - but instead seems utterly real. Some might dismiss ""Mockingjay Part 2"" as ""A Childs First War-Is-Hell"" but given that most mainstream movies have little more on their mind than selling backpacks and action figures this is a film that dares to be about something while still delivering as a piece of straightforward entertainment. Like most movies featuring and presumably aimed at women its been easy for the culture to slough off this series but the passing of the years and the rise of future franchise entertainments will only burnish the reputation of ""The Hunger Games.""

What started as a game culminates in deadly serious terms with a full-scale overthrow of the system itself in ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 2"" which counters the meager helpings offered by most teen-driven entertainment with one of the heartiest character arcs ever afforded a young female protagonist. After being forced to hunt other innocent children for sport Katniss Everdeen rallies her fellow rebels to rise up against the Capitol and thats not even the most revolutionary thing about this fourth and final installment in Suzanne Collins dystopian adventure series which continues to implicate its own fan base in the bloodlust even as it kills off many of their favorite characters. Though domestic B.O. dipped some 20% for the previous feature this ultra-dark deliberately paced climax should recover somewhat even as it ventures down bleaker channels still paying off the gamble of having stayed true to its source. Katniss may be 17 years old as ""The Hunger Games"" reaches its long-awaited finale but in the hands of director Francis Lawrence (who took the reins from Gary Ross after the first film) the series has veered far from the realm of traditional young-adult entertainment. For all intents and purposes ""Mockingjay"" is a war movie albeit one starring an iconic athletic Joan of Arc-like heroine (once again played by Jennifer Lawrence) and featuring battle scenes that feel suspiciously like extensions of previous Hunger Games -- those arena death matches where sadistic dictator Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland that master of the menacing grin) unleashed high-tech and bioengineered weapons which have since been tucked away into booby-trapped ""pods"" all over the Capitol streets. Though these inventive challenges make for an entertaining Capture the Flag-style obstacle course Collins (who once again earns an ""adaptation"" credit) and returning screenwriters Peter Craig and Danny Strong are clearly more concerned with the mass-media manipulation of combat footage than the are in what actually transpires in the trenches. Modern warfare Collins suggests is literally a ""show of force"" complete with all the theatricality that implies and her dystopian Oz will ultimately be ruled by the showman -- or woman since Snows worthiest rival is Alma Coin (a severe if somewhat less interesting Julianne Moore) -- with the most compelling narrative to share over the airwaves. Needless to say it would be unwise for anyone not yet versed in the series mythology to jump in at this late stage as ""Mockingjay -- Part 2"" is no mere sequel but the finale of an ambitious narrative in which the tragedy of each fatality relies on connections established in previous films. While hardly unique to ""The Hunger Games"" this cumulative-storytelling approach feels perfectly consistent with sophisticated serialized TV and film franchises (""Harry Potter"" in particular) that respect viewers ability to track multiple individuals and intrigues over a span of years -- which is to say theres no ""Previously in Panem ... "" catch-up sequence to situate newcomers here. That said director Lawrence does allow enough room for audiences to process whats unfolding before them working at a classical pace thats become increasingly rare among breakneck modern blockbusters. One could argue that ""Mockingjay"" didnt really merit being split in two (and surely a single three-hour movie could be made of it) but we benefit from the fact that the film has been given room to breathe which allows for subtle character moments -- including a nice bonding scene between Katniss and standoffish fellow victor Johanna (Jena Malone) that substitutes for their having been roommates in the book -- and the gradual building of suspense during the actual siege in the Capitol. For those who dont clearly remember all that has come before the film opens immediately after Katniss has been reunited with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who spent nearly the entirety of ""Part 1"" under Snows control tortured and ""highjacked"" (brainwashed with tracker-jacker venom) into hating Katniss only to end the film rescued and returned to District 13. But in what state? Or to echo Peetas distress in his own words borrowing a line that may as well apply to the entire media-managed revolution ""Real or not real?"" Such questions hover over nearly everything in ""Part 2"" where what remains of Katniss and Peetas always ambiguous romance becomes still more complex now that the purity of his love has been cast in doubt. In the past Peetas feelings for her were always sincere whereas Katniss was the one who performed her part exclusively for the cameras benefit guarding her heart for childhood sweetheart Gale (Liam Hemsworth). Now Katniss fears that Peeta has been programmed to assassinate her but also discovers that Gale isnt the man she once believed but rather a ruthless battle strategist willing to sacrifice innocent lives in his attacks on District 2 and the Capitol. From the very outset of the series Katniss has been faced with difficult moral questions. Nearly always she acted out of a naive sense of what was right starting with her decision to take younger sister Prims place in the Hunger Games. In the intervening time she has gained an audience with Panems top power mongers her cynicism steadily growing as she comes to recognize how such individuals operate. By this point Coin is as much a figure of suspicion as Snow and Katniss disobeys her orders (to function as rebel-alliance cheerleader in ""propos"" or propaganda spots directed against the Capitol) and decides to hunt Snow down herself -- an easier choice to understand than the pics subversive final twist which spectacularly re-establishes Katniss defiant individuality. As demonstrated in an early scene when a P.O.W. from District 2 holds her at gunpoint and demands one good reason he shouldnt pull the trigger Katniss considers her life no more valuable than those around her refusing to buy into her own mythology. Though she has allies -- and indeed reteams with a squad of familiar faces including Gale newly wed Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and former bodyguard Boggs (Mahershala Ali) for the Capitol assault -- Katniss latest moral dilemmas leave her feeling more alone than ever. Like little Frodo Baggins crushed and corrupted by his heavy burden over the course of three films shes not the same person she was when her adventure began. Similarly Jennifer Lawrence isnt the same actress having grown from the hardy yet resourceful child of ""Winters Bone"" to the assertive adult seen in ""American Hustle."" That evolution serves her character well and Lawrence (the director) engineers the film to replicate the effect of Collins first-person narration. We experience much of ""Mockingjay"" from a relatively subjective point of view either seeing things over her shoulder or processing how the resulting emotions register on her face which the actress controls with a subtlety befitting the widescreen pics Imax proportions. That same subtlety doesnt necessarily extend to James Newton Howards score which fluctuates from soap-opera-style piano accents to full-blown action-movie bombast (with a lovely Celtic wedding ballad on the occasion of Finnicks marriage). Even so Howards music becomes downright vital during the films most claustrophobic sequence as Katniss squad comes face-to-face with a herd of ferocious mutants in the Capitols underground sewer system resulting in a ""mutt"" attack more intense than any of the demon or zombie nastiness the helmer conjured in ""Constantine"" or ""I Am Legend."" All three of his ""Hunger Games"" assignments benefit from the world-building talents the director developed on those earlier sci-fi thrillers and here he delivers the most complete evocation of Panem yet -- although some may be disappointed to see the battle for District 2 reduced to a CGI firebombing glimpsed over Katniss shoulder. The film makes up for that with impressive Capitol action building the city above and below ground through a combination of heavy-concrete German locations and digital trickery best showcased in a terrific set piece in which Katniss and her crew work out personal differences amid a rising tide of black oil. The nasty liquid swallows a few of her friends while others die in even more horrifying ways later on but theres no fun left in killing either for Katniss or her fans. In fact some of the deaths are downright devastating underscoring how much more profound Collins political critique has become by this stage. Just think It was Katniss instinct to protect Prim (Willow Shields) that drew her into the center of Snows madness and by the end shes in a position to take revenge upon the evil president while her younger sister has joined the front lines. The one death no one could have foreseen that of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman adds welcome resonance to his scenes as gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee while leaving him sorely missing from a crucial emotional moment in which Woody Harrelsons Haymitch arrives with a letter containing the characters final words. Though the script adheres to Collins novel everything that follows feels extraneous with a succession of endings straining the patience somewhat. While the series remarkably managed to sustain its cast and credibility across four increasingly ambitious features Francis Lawrence doesnt quite recognize when its game over.

Annie says November 19 2015 at 747 am The movie was very faithful to the book and that was good but I was hoping for more grief in the end. In the books weeks go by after the revolution ends and Katniss goes home but here it was rushed we didnt see Katniss grief except for the part where she yells at the cat. Reply Lissell Paredes says November 11 2015 at 347 am ""...and featuring battle scenes that feel suspiciously like extensions of previous Hunger Games..."" This is why I hate critics especially those who havent read the books and complain about stupid things. That was the point. That it felt like another Hunger Games. Snow is a sadistic mfer and that was his way if punishing Katniss. Same w/ Mockingjay 1. Some critic had the nerve to complain about the fact that the movie didnt feel complete and it felt like the setup for something else... Uh... Yeah thats exactly what it was. Seriously if youre going to criticize a movie that is based off of a book bother reading the damn book. Reply heyheyheyehyy says November 6 2015 at 238 am THIS FILM IS GOING TO BE AMAZING D With books like those no way even the worst director could go wrong. Though Francis Lawrence is a fantastic director. Hence I think this movies gonna be just as great as the others D Cannot wait D D TEAMKATNISS TEAMLAWRencE x Reply john says November 5 2015 at 233 am Hunger Games is a great series of films. This last one is going to be a smash hit. Reply Otaku says November 4 2015 at 1137 pm You guys are complaining about ""Spoilers""... Really??? I would hardly label any of the text of this article as a spoiler. Let me give you another thing to think about and I havent even seen this movie yet.. but Katniss and her cause will win in the end. Peeta will recover from his ""mental breakdown"" and everybody will sing and dance in the joy of overthrowing the old government. Oh boy If you guys cant figure out a standard plot-line and just enjoy the movie.. any movie for what it is.. Entertainment.. Then there is seriously something wrong with you that maybe trying to live in the real world for a change will restore your values of what is really important to be complaining about. Reply Tara says November 4 2015 at 645 pm ""Welcome"".... REALLY???? ""The one death no one could have foreseen that of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman adds welcome resonance to his scenes as gamemaster"" Reply Micah says November 4 2015 at 602 pm Although Im a huge fan of the books and the previous movies I wasnt excited for this movie until I read your review. Now I cant wait. Reply CelluloidFan35mm says November 4 2015 at 548 pm I may sit this one out and wait until the Blu-Ray to try to finish it out. Though I have not read any of the books I gave the series a fair shot as a filmgoer but I felt that it was all lackluster but stuck it out hoping for improvement. I disliked the first film. Catching Fire I enjoyed from a technical standpoint. It was better directed had better cinematography a much larger scale and exciting acting from the supporting actors especially from the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman Donald Sutherland and Elizabeth Banks (Im sorry but Jennifer Lawrences acting in my eyes has never truly impressed or moved me. ) but didnt get any better narrative wise. Mockingjay Part One actually felt like half a movie and had no business being split in half IMO so at this point I may just tap out of this one. I understood its themes and what it was all about but was never truly entertained. Reply Corinne says November 7 2015 at 426 pm ""(Im sorry but Jennifer Lawrences acting in my eyes has never truly impressed or moved me. ) "" I agree 100%. Ill skip this one too. As far as dystopian/futurustic movies go Ill take 100 times Fury Road Ex-machina and Scorch trials above any of the hunger games franchise. the books are decent but Jennifer failed to portray convincingly a birracial survivol teen like Katniss. Reply Cindylover1969 says November 5 2015 at 950 pm ""Im sorry but Jennifer Lawrences acting in my eyes has never truly impressed or moved me."" You fail forever. ""Mockingjay Part One actually felt like half a movie"" Possibly because it was you tedious person. Reply William says November 4 2015 at 535 pm Loved the other 3 movies cant wait to see this one Have to say though I have never read a review with so many spoilers. Kinda wish I had missed this review. Reply Kathleen says November 4 2015 at 636 pm Dont worry if you havent read the books...they still left the big stuff out. Reply William says November 4 2015 at 748 pm Thanks havent read the books and with that in mind I would much rather not know the outcome of various scenes beforehand Contessa46 says November 4 2015 at 459 pm Love the Hunger Games series and li forward to MJ2- Reply Tom says November 4 2015 at 226 pm Great review thank god it has decent base reviews so far - Id hate for it be received as Mockingjay Part 1 was. I for one am pleased that the book was split into 2 films as a) we get an extra HG movie and b) it creates more character development. Just a note for the future especially with movies like this. This review contains a few spoilers about the film... Might be wise to warn fans about this Reply LOL says November 4 2015 at 1257 pm Sounds like a crap film. Reply Jake Saavedra says November 4 2015 at 128 pm This troll doesnt understand the themes of this franchise. Dont waste exposing your empty filthy mindset without looking at it properly. Talk if youve already seen it. If not then just shut the hell up. Were all entitled to give our opinions about everything but please learn to filter your thoughts. You sound like an uneducated man. My goodness. Reply b says November 4 2015 at 124 pm Crap? Just like your comments.
