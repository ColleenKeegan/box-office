Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Marie Antoinette"" with Kirsten Dunst Jason Schwartzman Judy Davis Rip Torn Rose Byrne Asia Argento Molly Shannon Shirley Henderson Danny Huston Steve Coogan. Written and directed by Sofia Coppola based on the book ""Marie Antoinette The Journey"" by Antonia Fraser. 118 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity and innuendo. Several theaters. Sofia Coppola specializes in lost girls wafting through a mysteriously foreign world. In ""The Virgin Suicides"" that world was adolescence; in ""Lost in Translation"" it was Japan seen through the soft eyes of a young directionless American. In Coppolas third and most ambitious film ""Marie Antoinette"" Kirsten Dunst plays the young French queen brought from her Austrian home as a teenager in 1770 to marry the future King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman). Swirling with candy-box colors rustling silks and dangling earrings the film is a sensual delight but behind the ravishing style is an unexpectedly poignant portrait. Marie Antoinette in this vision is a girl trying to find her way; an Alice in a very odd Wonderland. Dunst -- who as a teenager provided the emotional center of ""The Virgin Suicides"" -- is soft and vulnerable here subtly demonstrating Marie Antoinettes growing maturity. Arriving in France for the first time she must endure the demeaning ""handover"" ceremony (documented in Antonia Frasers fascinating book ""Marie Antoinette The Journey"" on which this film is based). Nothing of Austria could enter France with her even her beloved dog; she was stripped to her stockings and reclothed in French finery. As Dunst emerges from the handover tent shes already transformed The laughing long-haired girl now has an intricate coiffure and a chin raised firmly ready to leave girlhood behind. But the court she finds at Versailles (after a speedy marriage ceremony to a polite but unenthusiastic Louis) is a bewildering place. Crowds of noblewomen attend her ritual dressing every morning; an audience watches her every meal. After church each day theres little to do but gossip -- or eye the courtiers busily gossiping about her. (""She looks like a little piece of cake"" murmurs one.) And Marie Antoinette cant even carry out her one purpose of providing an heir The royal marriage went unconsummated for many years. Little happens for much of ""Marie Antoinette"" but Coppola is a visual storyteller and with her first big canvas she creates a giddy world at Versailles in color and light. Everything looks edible in creamy pastels and ice-cream brights In an opening shot Dunst lounges in a petticoat so white and frothy it might be made of whipped cream. Lonely and unhappy Marie Antoinette takes refuge in style and fantasy. We watch her choosing fabrics squealing with joy at a new hairstyle finding meaning in adornment and play. On the soundtrack Baroque composer Rameau is joined by 80s rock; like the casts variety of natural accents its occasionally jarring but feels oddly right. Theres a contemporary sensibility thats entirely present here and its part of what gives the film its life. The French Revolution is stirring but we see little of it here; Coppola keeps her focus within the walls of Versailles following her heroine in her fragile yet exquisite world. Dunst wrapped in a gown of dusty French blue gazes out past the cameras eye beautiful and remote. This Marie Antoinette has a girlishness that cant last; the world will catch up with her no matter how fast she whirls.

Starring Kirsten Dunst and Jason Schwartzman. Directed by Sofia Coppola. (PG-13. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That writer-director Sofia Coppola did not want to make a conventional story about Marie Antoinette is to her credit. The tale of the doomed French queen has been told before and the stations of that story -- Louis sex problem the Swedish boyfriend the scandal involving a necklace the arrest the trials the beheadings -- are painful drawn out and familiar. But with ""Marie Antoinette"" Coppola offers only a handsome style piece in its place lacking in wit or real significance. Theres a point to the story of sorts something about a celebration of ephemeral pleasure and the joys of grabbing life in the moment etc. Yet if you really look at what this movie is saying youll find something bordering on ridiculous Boiled down to essentials ""Marie Antoinette"" is an extended brief extolling the all-embracing exuberance and sterling humanity of rich girls who like to shop. Come to think of it Coppolas ""Lost in Translation"" touched on that theme too but at least there the young heroine had the good sense to be miserable about lying around doing nothing. By contrast Marie Antoinette couldnt be happier. Her life is presented as a succession of meaningless parties to which the audience is invited unfortunately. These parties are offered neither as visions of appalling decadence nor appealing glamour but rather of giddy energetic stupidity. We watch the queen smiling gambling and flirting and were supposed to feel for her knowing that sooner or later somebodys going to chop that poor girls head off. Vive la Revolution. Yet the film survives for the first hour with its arresting mix of New Wave graphics (on the credits) 80s pop tunes (on the soundtrack) and sumptuous 18th century styles. There are hip casting choices such as Asia Argento as Madame Du Barry and Marianne Faithfull as Empress Maria Teresa and the movie to the extent it can benefits from the lively radiance of Kirsten Dunst in the title role. Research into the customs and manners of the French court bear fruit in a number of scenes in which Coppola details the elaborate rituals attending the most routine functions of life. As the Dauphine Marie Antoinette cant dress herself. Everything must be handed to her by the attendant of the highest rank. Meals are equally starched and ludicrous affairs involving stentorian announcements of each course and multiple glasses for each beverage. So far as I know these details are accurate and until Coppola no one has ever portrayed them onscreen. They convey the unnatural distance between real life and palace life and they show why a person of spirit such as the young queen should want to break loose and have a good time. In fact Coppola has no trouble convincing viewers that Marie Antoinette is an interesting historical subject but theres a big distance between that and creating a fascinating personality or fashioning a compelling narrative. Coppola presents Marie Antoinette as merely an average acquisitive young woman. That might have worked had the French court been presented as complex and formidable but Coppola takes the court -- a vipers nest by every account -- and blands it into innocuousness. Even Du Barry is handled with ease. The clumsy storytelling stretches out the issue of Louis (Jason Schwartzman) sexual unresponsiveness and then resolves it unconvincingly. Meanwhile the Revolution is stirring. Someone rushes up and says ""The Bastille has been stormed"" He might just as well have said ""Lincoln has been assassinated"" It all happens offscreen. Eventually all the ingredients for a disaster are in place a defanged court an offscreen revolution and a knucklehead for a heroine. The reductive approach illuminates nothing about the queen except to suggest that she was an idiot and portentous shots of her rushing down opulent corridors (to a rock soundtrack) cant lend her stature. Gradually watching Marie Antoinette giggling with her big-haired friends starts to feel like being trapped in a girls dorm (with wigs). Mercifully Coppola cuts out of the story early before the queen loses her family and her life. Coppolas queen experiences no inner transformation or redemption because in this telling shes in no need of it. Shes cool to begin with. For Coppola Marie Antoinettes life officially ends the minute she loses her possessions. At least this movies priorities are consistent. -- Advisory Partial nudity sexual situations.

Jason Schwartzman and Kirsten Dunst star in Marie Antoinette. Photo Sony Pictures Marie Antoinette 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Did you know Marie Antoinette owned fur-covered shoes? Ate messy pastries with her fingers? Did you know she liked to gamble knock back the sauce party hearty till the sun came up and dance to infectious club tunes? Its true. And while she checked out clothing Bow Wow Wows I Want Candy played in her boudoir. Oh -- and that business about feudalism ignoring the hunger of a nation losing her head to the guillotine etc. etc. All that bother. Who cares It has no business in a movie about Marie Antoinette queen of rock and sugar baby par excellence. Sofia Coppolas latest film doesnt much care about the sociopolitical genesis of the French Revolution choosing to zero in on M.A.s Imelda Marcos-scale shoe collection and 80-foot hairdos rather than the scruffy masses who overthrew the monarchy. Granted theres occasional talk of a bread shortage in the country at large and at the end of the film we actually get to see rabble with pitchforks outside Versailles. But this is not a movie about them. (Perhaps like Clint Eastwood Coppola plans to release a companion film from the opposing point of view.) Its inside the palace that counts -- all of its champagne-chugging powdered-wiggy ruffle-skirted excess. ""This is ridiculous"" declares the young royal shortly after her arrival in France as she learns to navigate the rococo protocols of dressing for breakfast. ""This Madame"" snaps a woman of the court ""is Versailles."" Indeed and what an amazing place it is. What amazing star power Kirsten Dunst displays here. The film (directed and written by Coppola from Antonia Frasers biography Marie Antoinette The Journey) requires Dunst to age from the sweet-cheeks 14-year-old Austrian archduchess who married Louis XVI heir to the throne of France to the dazed and saddened mother of two who was bundled off by revolutionaries in 1789. During the course of those 20-plus years she matures convincingly on-screen but never loses her girlish bounce charming the camera and her court while spending the country into ruin. But theres not much meat at this banquet only sweets. Coppolas first film as writer-director since 2003s Lost in Translation covers some of the same terrain -- an alien navigating foreign lands -- and it flirts with the same hip attitude of bewildered innocence. But it stops there. Hints of depth and complexity only rarely emerge and the movie never moves far beyond its ab-fab parade of debauchment. After Marie Antoinette marries Louis (Jason Schwartzman who mouths a few brief lines and smiles occasionally) she retires to his frigid bed and the film spends a few reels on their unions long-delayed consummation. It asks whether Louis marital disinterest prompted Maries profligate spending habits a forerunner to the 21st-century shopaholism of the bored suburban house-spouse. It introduces a Swedish hunk (Jamie Dornan) an out-there hairdresser (James Lance) a randy king (Rip Torn) a promiscuous du Barry (Asia Argento) a snooty Comtesse (Judy Davis) and a passel of catty Versailles regulars lazing about in silk. It places them all in stunningly gorgeous settings in and around the palace using Lance Acords incandescent photography to highlight the dissolute beauty of a doomed regime. The upshot is a feature-length binge of eye candy mouthwatering yes but empty calories on an empty stomach. Go ahead and eat cake but beware the glucose crash. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 2 Reach Ultra Clean Toothbrushes for 1 + pickup at Target Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Carbon Fiber Pattern Case for iPhone 6/6 Plus for 1 + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Sofia Coppola has gone and done a very odd thing. Shes put her script for a lavish Marie Antoinette period piece in a blender with childhood memories of John Hughes teen melodramas along with adult admiration of Terrence Malicks nature idylls. The result is a silly piece of costume jewelry called ""Marie Antoinette"" and no the soldering of a new-wave-revival soundtrack with 18th-century Versailles is not interesting enough to save this bauble. ""Marie Antoinette"" is two hours of royalty porn the sweetest cakes and prettiest lap dogs ever you shall see and almost nothing in the way of authentic emotion or drama. If you could predict the shallowness of the movie that might be made by a director who collaborated with The New York Times style magazine on a shoppers guide to Paris ""Marie Antoinette"" is that film. The whip-smart makers of ""The Queen"" (see cover review) show us how the other half lives by imagining how they think; Coppola tries to show us by merely demonstrating how they dressed. What few innovative touches there are in ""Marie Antoinette"" feel shrunken and half-withdrawn as if Coppola had thought better of them a brief glimpse of Converse tennis shoes in Maries otherwise elegant closet and that soundtrack which doesnt even have the conviction to remain new wave throughout - there is far more rococo than rock in the music and therefore the mood. The most puzzling aspect of Coppolas movie is her decision to stay inside the palace throughout with almost no word from outside. That Paris a few miles away was seething in class revolt and dire poverty is nowhere to be found in ""Marie Antoinette""; the queen (Kirsten Dunst) is allowed to reclaim her historically abysmal image by remarking offhandedly that she never did say ""let them eat cake."" For the rest of the movie the righteous rabble is represented only by a cliched pitchfork-wielding mob borrowed from the set of ""Young Frankenstein."" The queen and her adolescent clique pout their way through the halls of Versaille as if they were remaking ""The Breakfast Club."" An interlude where Marie discovers nature and constructs a faux-peasant farm is visually stunning yet psychologically bankrupt. It didnt have to be this way and oh the pity that so much money was spent by so few to such impoverished ends. Dunst makes a luminescent and utterly sympathetic picture as she does in all her movies. If only shed been given something to say. Some historical accounts credit Marie Antoinette for a fierce maternal instinct and loyalty to her husband amid the revolution - would that we could see more than a glimpse of that here. If the intent is to rehabilitate an iconic figure then ask the queen to do somewhat more than be patient in the marriage bed with her asexual husband (Jason Schwartzman amusing if slightly inert.) With a terrific movie like ""The Queen"" at hand for comparison its impossible not to ask more from an allegedly up-and-coming filmmaker like Coppola. A smart look inside the dauphines palace was possible and there are a few tantalizing glimpses. History shows that the Austrian princess Marie had to give up her national past upon marrying the man who would become Louis the 16th. French officials met her at a tent straddling the border and she literally stripped to take up her new life. That scene with Dunst and her sad smile is touching. The royal consummation moreover was a spectator sport at court with a throng of 30 blessing their bed and checking the sheets each morning for evidence. This precursor to fantasy football clearly pains the future queen yet Coppola gives her no one to confide in or to expand the rituals meaning outside the fortress. When the old king dies 20-year-old Louis XVI kneels to take the crown and says ""Dear God guide us and protect us for we are too young to reign."" Coppola might check with her fearsome P.R. machine and offer the same plea for her movies dont yet seem quite as smart as she thinks she is. |""Marie Antoinette"" PG-13 for some nudity and mature subject matter|2 hours 3 minutes|PERIOD DRAMA|Written and directed by Sofia Coppola; starring Kirsten Dunst Jason Schwartzman Rip Torn Judy Davis Steve Coogan and Danny Huston|Opens today at area theaters.

Marie Antoinette Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/marie-antoinette-2006,200,marieantoinette11,marieantoinette,rogerebert
"Dunst makes royal ennui stylish in Antoinette - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Dunst makes royal ennui stylish in Antoinette By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 20 2006 Well she never was the peoples queen. In ``Marie Antoinette"" Sofia Coppolas beguiling consideration of the teen monarchs controversial reign she never gets around to it. Stuck in big boring Versailles while combat and famine seize Europe Marie (Kirsten Dunst) orders shoes from Paris and gets fitted for dresses. She devours pastry gets her hair done by a flamingly fabulous friend and runs off to masquerade balls. This Austrian lass sounds and acts like a Southern California princess.In the opening minutes Marie arrives in a French forest after an eternal carriage ride for the handover ceremony between Marie and her French fiance the Dauphin Louis Auguste (Jason Schwartzman). When her door pops open slouched in her seat she asks her loyal adviser (Steve Coogan) ``Are we there yet?""The marriage is to unify her country and Louiss. And the gist of the story finds Marie under tremendous pressure from her family to seduce her boyishly asexual husband for an heir that will seal the Franco-Austrian alliance. For her part Marie looks both enthralled with and skittish about her new assignment. She gains a husband but she loses a dog. ``Mops"" Marie cries as someone takes away her tiny pocket pug.What you ask is Coppola up to? ``The Simple Life Versailles "" ? Its a tempting possibility since the first quarter of ``Marie Antoinette"" presents in unsparing detail the minutia of royal etiquette and Maries annoyance with it.One morning dressing ritual leaves her shivering naked as the woman of the highest rank wins the honor of slipping a gown over her. ``This is ridiculous"" Marie snarls. The film makes delicate comedy of the spectacle that her marriage is required to be. Dozens stand by as she and Louis climb into bed for the first time. Scores look on as they sit before copious piles of food. Before there was reality television there was this reality tableaux vivant. But only up to a point is Dunsts Marie like a certain American heiress with fake-French trappings. And only up to a point is the filmmaker offering satirical commentary.Does Coppola mean to tell us that were Marie Antoinette with us today that shed listen to the Strokes and issue decrees via MySpace? Is it that she was just grossly misunderstood as Antonia Fraser demonstrated in the terrific book that inspired this movie? Or does Coppola feel a bond with Marie as a tastemaker? As art the movie is neither shallow nor profound just inconsequential. Yet Coppola is too clever a filmmaker to dismiss the movie out of hand. If her film is mostly surface then she skims with style.Here and there the requisite chamber music falls away and the yips and yowls of Gang of Four and Bow Wow Wow tear up the soundtrack. The costumes by Milena Canonero are works of art in themselves. Do yourself a favor and savor the detailing on each garment The clothes are where all the drama is. Given Coppolas fashion-first approach its a miracle the film doesnt feel more like a long perfume ad. But the movie has atmosphere beauty spirit and exquisite production design photography and editing. Sometimes ``Marie Antoinette"" feels like a knowing knock on tourism (lets make a movie about the French with American accents) and a more intentional jab at American cluelessness than ``Lost in Translation"" which for all its prettiness reduced Tokyo to a sideshow. Coppola just lacks the wisdom or the focus to crystallize any particular critical idea.Her movie is cool as a matter of fashion yes but also of mood. The film that occurred to me frequently during ``Marie Antoinette"" was Stanley Kubricks fastidious ``Barry Lyndon"" from 1975 another self-conscious approach to 18th-century Europe featuring Canoneros marvelous clothes. While Kubricks film was far bigger in scope and more uptight both movies operate at a comical emotional remove.``Marie Antoinette"" is also the more shameless work of hipsterism. Behold Marianne Faithfull as Maries mother. Look Molly Shannon and Shirley Henderson as gossipy aristos. As Louis XV Rip Torn plows through the movie like an enormous pig and Asia Argento vamps along as his slutty mistress.Dunst is more than a bauble though. No one will mistake Coppola for a discursive screenwriter so the actress doesnt have much to say. But the director provides ample opportunity to show what a marvelously transparent performer her star is. This is not a part that calls for fire or angst. It requires frolic mirth exasperation and ennui and I can think of no better woman in Hollywood for that job than Dunst. Who else can express boredom without seeming bored?What you miss in ``Marie Antoinette"" -- and in ``Lost in Translation"" for that matter -- is the burning human urgency and aesthetic wit Coppola brought to 1999s ``The Virgin Suicides"" her first and still her best movie. Theyre glimpsed only in the final shot of a trashed Versailles. The image is pure rock n roll. Were to believe the revolutionaries did the smashing. But since Coppola doesnt say whos to stop us from thinking Marie and the gang didnt demolish the place before she and Louis checked out?Its in these last minutes that Coppolas faux-historical sheen proves surprisingly eloquent. She spares us details of the Terror. Yet as a carriage speeds away with Marie and Louis we know the after-party is going to hurt.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Why arent we being shot at one of the young men wonders to a comrade. Why not indeed? With horror-movie creepiness a slit suddenly opens in what looks to be a thatched mound in the hillside and the barrel of a machine gun snakes out. The camera now assuming the point of view of the Japanese soldiers in the camouflaged bunker pans across a column of Marines soon so soon to be the latest casualties of war. ENLARGE This sequence which takes place early in Clint Eastwoods ""Flags of Our Fathers"" is one haunting scene among many. His is a deeply affecting account admittedly a sometimes muddy one of the band of brothers in THE iconic photograph of World War II five Marines and a Navy corpsmen their faces obscured hoisting the U.S. flag atop Iwo Jimas Mount Suribachi. In fact it was the second of two flag raisings snapped that day by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal; a do-over was required when supposedly the secretary of the Navy demanded the first flag as a souvenir. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" also serves as testament to the fact that spin was as revered a tool in 1940s Washington as it is today. As a civilian that lone corpsman in the photo John ""Doc"" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe) worked as a barber for the local funeral home. When we first meet him hes none too skillfully trimming the locks of Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford) a Marine runner whos also destined to appear in the shot seen round the world. In the days before the assault on Iwo Jima -- eight inhospitable square miles described by a superior as resembling a burnt pork chop -- Bradley and Gagnon play cards with their buddies including Native American Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) whos nicknamed Chief Harlon Block (Benjamin Walker) and Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross) the goofy naive kid brother of the unit. Despite the best intentions of their commanding officer Michael Strank (Barry Pepper) who like Hayes and Block and Sousley would also appear in the photo these young men were ill-prepared for what waited in the islands black sand. ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which uses the hoary if reliable framing device of a journalist interviewing veterans inter-cuts the battlefield scene -- almost drained of color they have a stunning intensity and immediacy -- with scenes from the home front. There pols and public-relations specialists seek to capitalize on the sensation caused by the photo to sell more war bonds. They argue about strategy and turf and about how best to deploy their latest ""weapons"" the ""it"" boys of the moment Doc Bradley Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes the only three men from the picture to survive Iwo Jimas carnage. In fact the trio has simply exchanged one battleground for another a point made manifest by the pop-pop-pop of bullets bleeding into the sounds of popping flash bulbs. The decision to shoot from a distance the scene of the photo being snapped to forswear slow motion close-up views of the marines faces and images of the flag-raising taken from different angles -- honors the historical record. It also serves the plot which deals partly with the consequences of misidentifying one of the men in the picture. But whats good for the plot isnt necessarily good for viewers of the movie. Certain key Marines are given minimal face time and in their helmets they all look markedly similar -- so young and so scared. Consequently film audiences who might otherwise be focusing on the movies underlying themes of bigotry and media manipulation -- the casual racism directed at Chief the insistence that the trio re-enact their big moment by ""climbing"" a papier-mache mountain and planting Old Glory for the benefit of a cheering crowd at Soldier Field -- will instead be muttering to themselves ""Wait which one is Harlon?"" ""Was Hank (another Marine in the unit) in the picture or wasnt he?"" and ""Whose mother is that anyway?"" The cheap perfume of sentimentality wafts through the closing moments of ""Flags of Our Fathers."" Its all the more noticeable for having been avoided so well and so long. Mr. Eastwood knows that sort of thing doesnt mix with the stench of war. Running With Scissors Initially Deirdre Burroughs (Annette Bening) seems a quite delightful Auntie Mame to her young son Augusten (Jack Kaeding; as a teenager Joseph Cross) in the irritating adaptation of Mr. Burroughss 70s-era ""personal memoir."" Deirdre thinks nothing of keeping Augusten home from school to set her hair thinks nothing of rousing him in the middle of the night so he can listen to her latest -- ghastly -- confessional poem. ""Did it feel powerful to you?"" she demands. Augusten whos charmed by Mom and even at 6 nobodys fool gives the only possible answer that publication in the New Yorker is a slam dunk. ENLARGE Annette Bening plays an unconventional mother in Running With Scissors. But as the years go by and the rejection letters pile up and the vanity-published book of poems goes unheralded actually unnoticed Auntie Mame morphs into Auntie Maim. Deirdre with her delusions of grandeur is a one-woman wrecking crew hurling invective and punches at her soon-to-be ex-husband alcoholic Norman (the very good Alec Baldwin) and warning Augusten not to get in the way of her ambitions and her attempts to locate her creative unconscious. Ah life with mother. Finally Deirdre puts her head in the hands of Dr. Finch (Brian Cox) an unorthodox psychotherapist and unconventional thinker. How unconventional? He makes predictions based on the contours and placement of his bowel movements. Dr. Finch gives Deirdre Valium and false reassurances. He also gives her the opportunity to find her bliss in peace by insisting that the unwilling Augusten come live with his family. The menage includes his lank-haired mottle-cheeked wife Agnes (Jill Clayburgh) who eats pet kibble and obsessively watches episodes of the cult classic ""Dark Shadows"" perhaps regarding them as home movies; his daughters Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood) who snipe at each other like Joan Crawford and Bette Davis in ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane."" Theres also his patient and adopted son Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes) a 35-year-old schizophrenic who becomes Augustens lover. The laughter elicited by ""Running with Scissors"" tends to be of the embarrassed sort the impact of its neglected child horror story blunted. Blame it on the movies high-camp gloss; it trivializes what is far from trivial. It doesnt help that the story is told from Augustens adolescent perspective rather than from the vantage point of the adult Mr. Burroughs. Then theres the issue of the movies subject matter. Unless perhaps youre a psychiatric resident watching psychotics act out is equally disconcerting and tedious. Its the same old different over and over and over again. Ms. Bening takes her part and acts it all over the place while Ms. Paltrow and Ms. Wood do their best theater of the absurd. It is left to Ms. Clayburgh in a performance free of vanity and artifice to find the movies heart. Marie Antoinette It says something about Sofia Coppolas ""Marie Antoinette"" that its most touching moment occurs at the French-Austrian border where the title character (Kirsten Dunst) and prospective bride of the future king of France (Jason Schwartzman) must give up her beloved little pug Mops along with everything else from her past clothes undergarments and demure coiffure. Tearfully she hands over the little dog and submits to a makeover that includes a tossed salad of ringlets trying poor child -- shes only 14 -- to do whats expected of her. Viewed through a contemporary lens and set mostly to a score of 80s pop tunes this highly stylized self-conscious enterprise -- really a music video -- posits the misunderstood and vilified Marie nee Maria Antonia Josepha Johanna as a figure in the mold of Diana Princess of Wales. Like Diana she was trapped in a loveless certainly sexless marriage -- it took seven years for this royal union to be consummated. Like Diana she was caught in a web of ritual and protocol. This included a protracted daily battle for the honor of slipping on Marias chemise. ""This is ridiculous"" she complained. No came the answer this is Versailles. And Like Diana Marie was victimized by gossip and misrepresentation in the media (mon Dieu she never said ""let them eat cake."") Marie who as portrayed by Ms. Dunst sounds like a valley girl (and I dont mean the Loire Valley) finds succor in shopping (a sequence of her trying on shoes set to Bow Wow Wows ""I Want Candy"" suggests nothing so much as a secretary at a sample sale) in heading off incognito to Paris to cavort at a masked ball (to the tune of ""Fools Rush In"") and in the bucolic pleasures of her getaway Le Petit Trianon where she makes like a shepherdess and makes music with her courtiers -- think Peter Paul and Marie. ""Marie Antoinette"" which was shot at Versailles looks absolutely sumptuous but is ultimately as substantial as a bonbon.    VHS TIP Genevieve Bujold received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of the second wife quite soon the late wife of Richard Burtons vengeful Henry VIII in 1969s ""Anne of the Thousand Days.""    Last weeks film review of ""Deliver us from Evil"" described Cardinal Mahony as Bishop of Stockton in 1997. He was bishop there from 1980-85 and since then has been Archbishop of Los Angeles.

"Marie Antoinette reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Marie Antoinette reviewed. Marie Antoinette reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 19 2006 606 PM Queen Bees Sofia Coppola and Marie Antoinette have a lot in common. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about  Marie Antoinette by clicking the arrow on the player below Kirsten Dunst in Marie Antoinette Sofia Coppola is the Veruca Salt of American filmmakers. Shes the privileged little girl in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory whose father a nut tycoon makes sure his daughter wins a golden ticket to the Willie Wonka factory by buying up countless Wonka bars which his workers methodically unwrap till they find the prize. If Coppolas 2004 Academy Award for best original screenplay for Lost in Translation was her golden ticket to big-budget filmmaking Marie Antoinette is her prize a 40 million tour through the lush and hallucinatory candy land of 18 th-century France. Of course Roald Dahls insufferable Veruca Salt was eventually seized by angry squirrels and hurled down a garbage chute. Will Coppola suffer a similar fate when Marie Antoinette opens this Friday? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The film was simultaneously booed and given a standing ovation at Cannes and reviews have been not just mixed but fiercely divided. Like licorice Marie Antoinette is a confection you either love or hate and both affects seem tied to your feeling about the director herself and her apparent identification with Louis XVIs bride. For my part I can definitely say that I love licorice and hate Marie Antoinette. But Im still wrestling with the enigma of Sofia Coppola. Advertisement Given the films cavalier treatment of their countrys history French critics understandably head up the haters brigade. Agnes Poirier the London correspondent for Liberation scoffs ""There are two things [Coppola] likes dresses and pudding. ... Cinema is for Coppola a mirror in which she looks at herself not a mirror she holds to the world."" But many critics on both sides of the Atlantic defend the film in indulgent language that often seems to apply to its creator as well. To Entertainment WeeklysLisa Schwarzbaum Marie Antoinette is ""the work of a mature filmmaker who has identified and developed a new cinematic vocabulary to describe a new breed of post-postpostfeminist woman."" (The triple negative threw me for a minute but I think she means ""not feminist."") To be fair dresses and pudding are perfectly lovely things to contemplate and Marie Antoinette makes them look exquisitely desirable. It does the same for lingerie upholstery wigs babies and sheep. Whats impossible to tell is what if anything this film has to say about its objects of desire its subject herself the waning years of the French aristocracy or the present day. That Kirsten Dunsts dimples are irresistible? That lavender and turquoise look good together? That its really fun to have unlimited amounts of cash? Theres no question that making movies is at least in part always a matter of shopping. A director must select and find a way to pay for the right cast the right music the right cinematographer. And as this recent piece in the Times travel section shows Sofia Coppola is a peerless shopper. The movies signature set piece is a montage of Louis-heeled Manolo Blahnik shoes in Easter-egg colors filmed in fetishistic close-up to the strains of Bow Wow Wow singing ""I Want Candy."" Its exhilarating in the style of a high-end television commercial or magazine fashion spread. But by linking the excesses of the French court of the 1780s with the pop culture of the 1980s does Coppola intend to suggest that were overdue for another revolution? Or just that then as now les filles just want to have fun? If you follow Sofia Coppolas press coverage for a while (a project not recommended for those with a glucose intolerance) youll read how Coppola manages to mystify and charm her interlocutors with trailing-off sentences and evasive mumbles. Youll also come across frequent admonitions from critics to ""just go with it."" Its as if shes the blushing rose of cinema requiring protection from the harsh winds of unfavorable attention. References to her embarrassing casting as Mary Corleone in The Godfather Part III (1990) invariably celebrate her fortitude in surviving the savagery of the films reviews. But the negative critical response was justified; its hard to think of a more amateurish performance in a major Hollywood release of the last two decades. Advertisement Im not saying that Coppola is without talent as a director. She has a keen eye for composition impeccable taste in music and fashion and a nice sense of understatement. The Virgin Suicides was haunting if slight and Lost in Translation goes an amazingly long way on nothing but setting and mood. But its possible to believe both things that Coppola is a filmmaker of promise and that her path to success has been cushioned not only by her place in the Coppola family but by her own savvy image-management. She cultivates the persona of a shy melancholy and effortlessly glamorous girl wandering through a strange new world bemused by the accolades heaped upon her--a persona thats replicated in the dreamy glazed female protagonists of all three of her movies so far. These qualities have seduced among others fashion designer Marc Jacobs who named a handbag after Sofia (retail price 6950) and made her the face for his Essence perfume. ""If I were a girl"" Jacobs has said ""Id like to be Sofia. Shes very feminine and very quiet. Im sure she works quite hard but it all seems effortless."" Doesnt it just? Sofias father Francis named one of his Napa Valley sparkling wines after her The label describes the beverage as ""revolutionary petulant reactionary ebullient fragrant cold cool."" At least one of those adjectives ""reactionary"" might arguably sum up Marie Antoinette as well. In a Vanity Fair profile last month Evgenia Peretz wrote about the directors nontreatment of the rioting French proletariat in Marie Antoinette ""In neglecting them she has unwittingly taken a political stance."" Unwittingly? It seems disingenuous to suggest that a movie about the fall of the French monarchy could be anything but political. I dont ask Coppola to be unsympathetic to the young queen or even to devote any screen time to her arrest and decapitation. (The film ends abruptly as Jason Schwartzmans King Louis XVI and his queen flee Versailles in their royal coach after the storming of the Bastille.) But just because the films heroine has nothing to say about politics revolutionary or otherwise doesnt justify Coppola being similarly dumbstruck. ""Its not like Im a royalist"" Coppola protested in a recent interview when asked about her curiously blank take on the French Revolution. Ill take her word for it but youd never know it from the movie shes made which is at least as nostalgic about the ancien regime as Gone With the Wind is about the antebellum South. Coppolas heroine lodges a similar protest in the film upon hearing about her alleged wish for the starving masses to nourish themselves on cake. ""I would never say that"" the queen comments shocked to her ladies in waiting. According to the Antonia Fraser biography Marie Antoinette is based on she never did say those actual words--but the rest of the film shows her as exactly the kind of person who would say them so whats the difference? Peretzs Vanity Fair profile begins with the kind of protective disclaimer that Sofia Coppola tends to evoke from journalists ""It might be tempting to dismiss Coppola as a ditz who has successfully parlayed her famous name the right clothes and the right friends into an overblown image."" As a matter of fact it is; so much so that like Coppolas young queen faced with a Sevres platter of Laduree macaroons I simply must give in to temptation.

Is it OK to say I merely liked it a lot?Actually shot at Versailles with enough opulence to rival a Golden Age of Hollywood production ""Marie Antoinette"" serves up a tart conceit Marie (Kirsten Dunst) only 14 when she was brought over from Austria to marry Louis the dauphin (dull Jason Schwartzman) was essentially a flouncy sweet-souled shopaholic - a Valley Girl with a piled-high pouf.To emphasize the correspondence between then and now Coppola plasters the soundtrack with 80s pop music most deliciously Bow Wow Wows ""I Want Candy."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? At first all this goofball post-Modernism seems like a stunt but Coppola is really on to something. Instead of making the usual stuffy powdered wig movie about royalty she plays around with the form - not simply as a lark but also to get at emotional truths lacking in most historical epics. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The Marie Antoinette of this film which is derived from the recent Antonia Fraser biography may in fact be closer to the real McCoy than previous incarnations. Dunst seems authentic as the child bride not only because of her relative youth - the film spans almost 20 years - but also because we can unhesitatingly imagine her wide-eyed predicament of being cast into a court where suddenly a retinue attends ones every whim.Coppola initially presents Marie as a blank slate which limits our interest in her. The director seems to be making the point that Marie became a fashionista because she needed to shore up popular support while waiting for Louis to provide France with an heir. (She had to wait a long time - seven years - for the marriage to be consummated.) But Coppola doesnt have much of a feel for court intrigue so this point gets a bit lost.Whats surprising is that by the end ""Marie Antoinette"" for all its folderol is quite touching. As she also demonstrated in ""Lost in Translation"" Coppola has a gift for capturing the loneliness of individuals in limbo. The blank slate turns out to be not so blank after all.

"Crown Jewel washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Crown Jewel Her luck will soon change Kirsten Dunst center has the title role in Sofia Coppolas ultra-hip and occasionally anachronistic ""Marie Antoinette."" (Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 20 2006 Have you heard about ""Marie Antoinette""? If you followed the news from Cannes you know Sofia Coppolas movie about the legendary French queen was booed at that storied proving ground. The Web is abuzz with detractors who accuse Coppola of confecting a spiritually bereft apolitical spectacle of conspicuous consumption. Of indulging her own appetite for fashion pop culture and high style. Perhaps most unforgivably of being Sofia Coppola. Having now seen ""Marie Antoinette"" with expectations suitably managed the royal we have four words for the haters Let them eat crow. It turns out that ""Marie Antoinette"" may be the most fascinating cinematic Rorschach test to come down the pike (or land on the pike as it were) in a long time. With ""The Virgin Suicides"" and ""Lost in Translation"" Coppola proved to be a gifted stylist with an unusual talent for evoking mood and atmosphere and emotional truth but no one would have called those films particularly deep. With ""Marie Antoinette"" she has delivered a richly textured swiftly moving and surprisingly insightful story that resonates far deeper than just the occasional glimpse of a Converse peeking out from the chintz or snippet of a Gang of Four song. With its creative anachronisms and ultra-hip sensibility ""Marie Antoinette"" is sure to polarize viewers who will either decry the liberties it takes or love Coppolas irreverent but ultimately compassionate portrait of an easy-to-loathe monarch. By turns riotously giddy and supremely serene ""Marie Antoinette"" dispenses with the vague reveries that characterized Coppolas past work resulting in her most narrative -- and ambitious -- film to date. But fans will recognize her eternal subject the adolescent girl coping with coming of age. For Coppola Marie Antoinette isnt the haughty queen whose heartlessness helped foment a revolution. Shes a girl as Scarlett Johanssons character described herself in ""Lost in Translation"" who in another era would be taking dumb photographs of her feet. Of course those feet happen to be shod in ever more outrageous Manolo Blahniks as we see in ""Marie Antoinettes"" opening shot when the films captivating star Kirsten Dunst turns to the camera with a kittenish inscrutable look. From this cipherlike image the film goes back in time to 1768 when Marie Antoinettes ambitious mother the Queen of Austria (Marianne Faithfull) arranges her daughters engagement to the Duke of Berry the future Louis XVI of France. Its less a betrothal than a geopolitical merger and when the 14-year-old Marie Antoinette travels to France to meet her intended she is literally stripped of her past bidding her friends family and even clothes goodbye on a piece of land perfectly straddling Austrian and French soil. The young dauphine who emerges is sweet naive and wholly unprepared for the cloistered ritualized life of the Versailles court where she is a favorite of her husbands grandfather Louis XV (Rip Torn) and the subject of endless gossip on the part of her new family and retinue. Her marriage to the drippy Louis XVI played by a worried-looking Jason Schwartzman goes unconsummated for seven years with the dauphin neglecting his dewy wife in favor of riding to hounds or indulging his hobby of -- wait for it armchair Freudians -- making keys. Guided by the firm and joyless hand of the Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis) her chief attendant Marie Antoinette is thrust into the routine of church-aspic-cards whose strict codes of etiquette soon threaten to suck the very life from her. She may join the other caviling ladies of the court in snubbing the Comtesse du Barry Louis XVs lover (robustly played by Asia Argento) but theres a glimmer of longing behind the icy stare. By the time ""Marie Antoinette"" gets to its most notorious scene--an orgy of champagne petits fours and shoes set to Bow Wow Wows ""I Want Candy""-- its clear that Maries famous appetite for baubles and bows was less the character flaw of a spoiled princess than a pathological response to the double bind of being both painfully isolated and claustrophobically scrutinized. Following the lead of Antonia Fraser upon whose 2001 biography ""Marie Antoinette"" is based Coppola suggests that the queen was less a conspirator in the crimes of the Versailles court than a passive inexperienced pawn of it a sovereign whose only means to power was through pregnancy. Dunsts warm spontaneous and exuberant portrayal allows viewers to sympathize or at least better understand what led this teenager to become the symbol for all that was morally and politically indefensible about pre-revolutionary France. Presumably some of the criticism of ""Marie Antoinette"" stems from the fact that like her subjects Coppola never strays outside the gilded confines of the Versailles compound nor does she go into any detail about the depth and depravity of the corruption that marked the reign of Louis XVI and his wife. But to accuse ""Marie Antoinette"" of being apolitical widely misses the mark when the movie is so much about the sexual politics of Versailles where amid the profiteroles and peonies Marie Antoinettes every move was subject to strict regulation and ceremonial control. Coppolas use of New Romantic pop music works surprisingly well (theres only one misstep when Marie returns from an all-night soiree to a hysterically pitched cover of ""Fools Rush In"") and her injection of present-day signifiers and modern teen speak feels right and unforced including the witty inclusion of a pastel tennis shoe amid Maries fetishistic collection of footwear. That well-placed sneaker could be a symbol of the inescapable parallels with Coppolas own life She is a famous fashion plate herself and travels with the same kind of cosmopolitan groovers that are depicted in the film (""I love your hair"" one hanger-on says to another. ""Whats going on there?""). Coppolas access to Marie Antoinettes world goes even deeper than her ear for such louche cadences having grown up the daughter of Francis Ford (Hollywood royalty) surrounding herself with a closely held circle of family and close friends (Schwartzman is her cousin) and being obsessively observed and vilified from her ill-advised film debut in ""The Godfather III"" until this very day. People will come to ""Marie Antoinette"" with their own predispositions and will most likely leave with them intact; in all her work Coppola invites the audiences projections with an unusually large and porous canvas. But those willing to take the film on its own terms will be confronted with a portrait that while perhaps unsettling in its revisionist sympathies offers a valid provocation at a time when Americans are debating the costs of isolation both personal and political. Far from mere spectacle ""Marie Antoinette"" is instead a slyly subversive film seducing viewers with its endless montage of sumptuous excess but also daring them to empathize with the girl drowning in it. Marie Antoinette (123 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity and mild sexual innuendo.

Sofia Coppola has had a decent stab at it. Her schtick in writing and directing this dreamy evocation of the Versailles life of Marie Antoinette is to lean heavily on decor shoes and various superficial confections and steer clear of chitchat and context. Its the visual detail of the eighteenth-century setting of course that offers a slight nod to Kubrick while its Kirsten Dunst as the wide-eyed Austrian dauphine who evokes the cheap end of culture-clash comedy as she rolls her eyes in that oh-so Yankee way at the ridiculous European ways of the French at the same time breaking the films own convention that the French are played by Americans (Rip Torn brashly as Louis XV Jason Schwartzman ineffectually as the dauphin) and the Austrians by Brits (Marianne Faithfull disastrously as Antoinettes mother Steve Coogan passably as the Austrian ambassador).The film that most comes to mind when wondering where Coppola went wrong with this grand folly of style over substance is Gus Van Sants Last Days. Both films share the tragedy of a youngster caged by a public role a bold lack of interest in facts and exposition and a reliance on silence and mood. But while Last Days offered an implied and assured understanding of its hero neither Coppola nor Dunst demonstrates such intelligence in their consideration of Marie Antoinette. Coppolas treatment of the dauphins inability to consummate his marriage - the elephant in the bedroom - verges on the comedic so denying any real pain the one scene in which we witness Antoinette break down in tears behind closed doors is followed by a negating and brash montage of classy shoes and pretty cakes. Moments such as these confirm that Coppola is evading the issue of biography and indulging instead in the trappings of a social scene. The music might be a hoot (Gang of Four New Order Bow Wow Wow) but the soundtrack - like the distracting costumes cakes and production design - does everything to stress the youthful decadence of the French court and nothing to throw any light on the woman who gives the film its name. All of which is hip - but never history.

"Marie Antoinette | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; marie-antoinette ) Marie Antoinette (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Three adjectives spring to mind when describing Marie Antoinette odd irritating and tedious. (The last in that list could be replaced by ""boring."") This is a movie that never gets to the point perhaps because it doesnt recognize what the point is. As anyone knows who has spent any time studying 18th century France Marie-Antoinettes story is an interesting one provided one concentrates primarily on her post-Revolutionary life. Everything that happens before July 14 1789 (the day of the storming of the Bastille) is a prologue; the real meat comes after. Unfortunately for reasons known only to her Sofia Coppola has chosen to focus on the prologue. What could have been adequately captured in 15-20 minutes of screen time drags on forever and to further exacerbate matters both leads are miscast. The film was booed at Cannes before apologists got to work saying it wasnt that bad. The initial reaction is more indicative of the reaction Marie Antoinette deserves. In 1770 the 14-year old Austrian princess Marie-Antoinette (Kirstin Dunst) travels to France to marry the Dauphin Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) thereby cementing an alliance between the two countries. At first Marie has difficulty adjusting to the protocol-heavy routines of her new position and her only ally is Ambassador Mercy (Steve Coogan). Gradually however she grows into her role accumulating friends such as Comtesse de Noailles (Judy Davis) and Duchesse de Polignac (Rose Byrne) and making enemies including Madame du Barry (Asia Argento) the mistress of King Louis XV (Rip Torn). Because of her husbands lack of prowess in bed Maries marriage remains unconsummated which is cause for a growing concern about the lack of an heir. Try as she might however Marie cannot entice her husband to touch her when they retreat to their curtained and canopied bed at night. MarieAntoinette is mostly about the Dauphines adjustments to the customs of the French court and her attempts to conceive. The more interesting material including a possible affair and the growing unrest of the common people is left to the films final 40 minutes. By then a portion of the audience will have fallen asleep. The movie is somnambulant. It looks great with impeccable period detail and glorious visuals but the plot is stagnant. The lack of character development results in an uninteresting story. Plus theres no villain to provide conflict. For a while it appears that Madame du Barry might fill the role but she is removed about half-way through the film leaving a void. Just because the main character is shallow does not mean the movie has to follow the same pattern but in the case of Marie Antoinette thats what happens. In fact Marie is so dull that she is frequently overshadowed by the supporting characters many of whom are more colorful and lively. These include King Louis XV Madame du Barry and Comtesse de Noailles whose primary function is to give Marie etiquette lessons. Part of the problem is Kirsten Dunsts one-note performance which is as lacking in range as it is in energy. The other part is the script which fails to capture the French queens humanity. Its hard to decide whether Dunst or her co-star Jason Schwartzman is more ill-suited to the role. Both appear overwhelmed by their surroundings and neither succeeds in transforming their characters into living breathing individuals. They duel not to capture the cameras attention but to avoid it leaving the spotlight to Rip Torn Asia Argento Rose Byrne Judy Davis and Steve Coogan. These are capable actors but they cannot fill the cavity created by the lackluster interpretations of the leads. Perhaps the most curious aspect of Marie Antoinette is Coppolas choice of music. Instead of the usual classical stuff we might expect (although there is some of that) she employs contemporary numbers by artists like Bow Wow Wow The Cure and Adam Ant and the Ants. This results in ""Opus 23"" being followed by ""I Want Candy."" To say it creates a disconnect is an understatement. The movies opening credits feel like the start of Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I was reminded of A Knights Tale which tried something similar with equally limited success. What I wrote then applies now ""[The movie] appears to have entered The Twilight Zone as authored by Monty Python."" Much as I appreciate the virtues of both shows that should not be viewed as a compliment. Coppolas decision to truncate the story when she does causes Marie Antoinette to seem unfinished. History tells us what the Queens fate was; this movie does not. In terms of its factual accuracy Marie Antoinette should not be used as an historical reference. It massages facts to fit the story rather than the other way around. This would not be a bad thing if the resulting plot had a better focus than a rambling tour through Versailles during the 1770s and 1780s. For those who appreciated the elegance and character depth of Coppolas previous directorial efforts The Virgin Suicides and Lost in Translation Marie Antoinette is a disappointment of historical proportions.

And since this is Ms. Coppola were talking about stylish and soft-spoken Godfather royalty from the Hollywood kingdom herself its tempting to read autobiographical identification into the filmmakers madly chic tauntingly shallow biopic set during the young queens married life. Following Lost in Translation (in which a lonely effortlessly hip girl rattled around Japan) heres Coppolas Lost in Versailles. In this rarefied universe the privileged go shopping while unseen and unheard until the very end when they storm the palace the less style-conscious masses apparently get by on their own. Its tempting to search for autobiography yes but too easy This yummy-looking artfully personal historical fantasia borne on currents of melancholy and languor and rocking out to a divine soundtrack of 1980s New Romantic pop music (plenty of the Cure Bow Wow Wow and Adam Ant) is the work of a mature filmmaker who has identified and developed a new cinematic vocabulary to describe a new breed of post-postpostfeminist woman. And that contemporary creature is also of the artists own invention. Call that girl?Kirsten Dunst a vision of bewildered loveliness as the 14-year-old Marie of Austria betrothed in a political deal to the even more bewildered 15-year-old future Louis XVI of France played by Jason Schwartzman. (The marriage was famously unconsummated for seven years due to the child kings withering lack of sexual know-how.) With her winning touch of girlfriend-of-Spider-Man resilience and the easy modern way she wears her formidable ball gowns Dunst embodies the teen girl of today and of more than 200 years ago. And in returning to the star of her first feature The Virgin Suicides as muse the filmmaker wisely lets Dunst set the movies tone of voluptuous lostness. Marie Antoinette uses Antonia Frasers marvelous 2001 biography as a reference but Coppolas movie views the world through the young queens eyes. And eventually that narrow POV loses focus and veers toward distractedness as the seriousness of the brewing revolution becomes clearer. Instead friendless in an adopted country strangled by its own demands of etiquette (Judy Davis is a hoot as the worst of the sticklers the Comtesse de Noailles) and unable to arouse her husband Marie turns to luxury as solace -- cakes jewels parties shoes. Was she a flibbertigibbet a casualty of gossip and mean press coverage a Princess Diana before her time? Coppolas stranded royal suggests that at heart Marie Antoinette was just a simple girl who wanted to have fun and got her head handed to her.

Music aside Sofia Coppolas Marie Antoinette is far from a royal disgrace. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis (Photo Sofia Coppola/Courtesy of Sony Pictures) A s the princess of a filmmaking dynasty Sofia Coppola grew up steepedor perhaps I should say fermentedin the culture of movies but the ones she writes and directs dont look or sound like anyone elses. They are avidly defiantly sometimes obnoxiously original. With Marie Antoinette she continues to explore the melancholy and ethereal beauty of dislocation. In Lost in Translation her alter ego is a neglected young wife adrift in an alien culture. Now her alter ego is a neglected young wife adrift in an alien culture. A couple of centuries an ocean a few zillion francs and the bloody upending of a social order make a difference bien sur but the emotion that holds each film (as well as her first The Virgin Suicides) together is the same. It is the longing for release of a tremulous spirit trapped in an overbearingly material world. And trust me youve seen few material worlds as overbearing as Versailles in the eighteenth century. Coppolas protagonist is the last and most maligned French queen a young Austrian archduchess (Kirsten Dunst) whose empress mother (Marianne Faithfull) arranges her marriage to the future King Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) in an attempt to bridge the gap between the rival world powers. A glance at the names in the above parentheses confirms that this isnt your peres Versailles picture but Coppola sticks close to the historical facts. Working glancingly impressionistically from a sympathetic biography by Antonia Fraser she suggests that the woman who became a symbol for a profligate and disdainful aristocracy was a child with literally no conception of her relationship to French society. Trained in elaborate rituals buried in wigs and bodices smothered in unimaginable luxury she has few avenues of expression. BACKSTORY Though Marie Antoinettes ornate style hasnt always been in fashion its certainly popped up over the years. Norma Shearers portrayal of the queen in 1938 Oscar-nominee Marie Antoinette inspired power-hungry Eva Peron to dye her hair blonde. The do returned in 1990 when Madonna (who would play Evita six years later) performed Vogue at the MTV awards in full-on regal gear. Christina Aguilera dressed as Marie Antoinette in the bedroom scene of her 1999 video of What a Girl Wants. And Kirsten Dunsts appearance on the September cover of Vogue solidified the leading ladys place in style history. That makes Marie Antoinette sound as if it has a feminist thrust but this is basically the story of a little lost rich girl who becomes a party girl who becomes a national disgracein an utter vacuum. Early in the film Coppola lingers on her leading ladys soft face in all its pale-pink-blonde dreaminess as she hugs her small dog and watches the chill foreboding forest go by en route to a rendezvous with the French near the border between the countries. Led by a severe countess played by Judy Davis with the longest tightest neck muscles Ive ever seen the French deep-six the pooch and strip off all of Marie Antoinettes Austrian clothesgiving us Coppolas signature shot the strange new world viewed from behind her heroines tush. (The shot also opened Lost in Translationand although Im not complaining I confess that I dont understand all the connotations.) Whereas Coppolas last heroine suffered in isolation Marie Antoinette lives a bizarrely public life in which everything she does is the courts businessfrom eating breakfast to having sexual relations. The last bit is the sore point since the chunky young Louis shows little inclination to consummate his marriage. This might have been easier to understand if Dunst and Schwartzman had been closer to their characters true ages14 and 15. But you can still feel for the prince The future of France is a lot to have riding on ones swordsmanship. In the face of courtiers hissing Give us an heir its no wonder Marie Antoinette begins to cultivate a sphere of privacy. This is one of the most immediate personal costume dramas ever made and so its not unseemly to consider how the writer-director and her heroine overlap. Coppola grew up rich with a kingly patriarch who was sometimes two blackbirds short of a pie and either absent or under siege by creditors and who had the brainstorm to cast her in The Godfather Part III. After that humiliation she fled the spotlight and obviously developed an inner watchfulness. Having partied with the rich and hip she understands the pleasure in escapism as well as the sense of alienation it can reinforce. In the film as Marie Antoinette takes up gambling and gambolinglawn parties with booze and drugs and sexyou can feel the desperation under her drive for pleasure. Coppola discovers her heroine on the verdant grounds of her mini-estate reading from Rousseau to her companions The queen thinks shes finally in tune with the natural world but the natural world is about to trash her palace and whack off her head. The French Revolution (and the head-whacking) is beyond the movies scope and Coppola evinces little interest in narrative. As a screenwriter shes still learning She doesnt fully account for Marie Antoinettes antagonism toward Madame du Barry (a garishly amusing Asia Argento) the former prostitute and mistress of King Louis XV (Rip Torn). Nor does she concern herself with her protagonists transformation. In life Marie Antoinette took an increasingly active role in politics and urged her husband to build an army to take on the revolutionaries. But that queen doesnt gibe with the helpless child of privilege who finally realizes that theres nothing she can do about her image. Her decision to stand by her husband rather than flee for the border comes out of nowhere; and Dunst although charming and vulnerable simply doesnt have the resources to play the haggardness and despair of the final scenes. 1 2 Next Share this story...
