Comments Nims Island Recommended In this lively adventure comedy for girls Abigail Breslin plays a motherless tomboy living on a secluded Fiji island with her animal pals and her father a marine biologist (Gerard Butler). After hes lost at sea during a monsoon she e-mails an SOS to Alex Rover the Indiana Jones-type hero of her favorite books--not knowing that Alex is Alexandra (Jodie Foster) an agoraphobic novelist who hasnt stepped outside her San Francisco home for 16 months. Foster proves adept at broad physical comedy the animated sequences charm and codirectors Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett send up the make-believe Rover with panache. PG 95 min.

Thats the family-friendly message behind the engaging Nims Island. Parents will find it refreshing to watch the antics of a young heroine who has the best traits of childhood and none of the bratty mouthiness of so many youthful roles. As played by Abigail Breslin with her trademark youthful intelligence Nim is endearing enthusiastic resourceful and imaginative and shes a voracious reader. Based on the childrens novel by Wendy Orr Nims Island is a classy old-fashioned adventure tale in the tradition of Ring of Bright Water or The Black Stallion. CLIP Explore a little on Nims Island Nim named by her deceased mother is a winning and winsome 11-year-old who lives on a remote volcanic island with her scientist father. Gerard Butler is appropriately dashing and quite funny in a dual role as her dad and as Alex Rover the Indiana Jones-like adventure hero of a series of stories that Nim adores. Jodie Foster plays the real Alex (Alexandra) Rover an agoraphobic San Francisco-based writer who conjures up these tales of derring-do. She and Nim connect with a little help from technology. Nims island is a magical place where a sea lion is her cuddly companion lizards take part in anti-development schemes and messages are delivered via pelican. Though its a far-fetched story whose twists and turns are largely predictable its such an enjoyable flight of fancy that we happily go along for the ride. What Nim doesnt realize is that she is more like the courageous adventurer she idolizes than the books creator. We learn how brave she is when she is forced to spend several days alone on the island after her father goes off on a scientific quest and is lost at sea. One of the films highlights is the relationship between the writer Alex/Alexandra Rover and her fictional character Alex Rover. He is real to her and cajoles the phobic Alex into facing her fears in witty and entertaining ways. Nims Island is a win-win proposition an entertaining diverting adventure saga that offers excitement and a relatable heroine for children and also will remind their parents of favorite classics from their own youth.

(AP Photo/Fox) NO SALES This undated photo provided by Fox shows Abigail Breslin in a scene from ""Nims Island."" (AP Photo/Fox) NO SALES Photo AP/Fox Review Breslins Nim is queen of her island 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Nims Island Family adventure. Starring Abigail Breslin Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler. Directed by Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Nims Island"" is a combination of ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Home Alone"" if you can envision the stranded party as a preteen girl who has the survival skills of someone twice her age. Nims aquatic adventures and those on land provide the majority of thrills in this exhilarating and enchanting family picture. Its the best Ive seen this year and highly recommended for girls and for boys too. The movies endearing qualities are enhanced by a cast raring to go Abigail Breslin whose athletic shape as Nim may surprise ""Little Miss Sunshine"" fans; Jodie Foster as Alexandra Rover the author of Nims favorite adventure books; and Gerard Butler doing double duty as Nims loving dad Jack and Alex Rover the adventure hero Miss Rover created. Hollywood seems to be using Butler as a kind of utility player which is perfect for someone whos proved he can play anything from a he-man to a lover boy to a singing phantom. The best family fare inevitably is adapted from a book in which creativity is given space to breathe and ""Nims Island"" is no exception. Novelist Wendy Orr gave her imagination free rein in creating a safe harbor for Nim and her scientist dad. Orrs descriptions served as a blueprint for the set designers. They bring to life the deserted tropical island where Jack takes Nim after her mothers horrendous death at the bottom of the ocean. Hidden behind deadly coral reefs she and her dad prove that twos company. But Nim has other friends a doting 500-pound sea lion a playful iguana a bearded dragon and a pelican. They come in handy when Jack leaves one day to search the waters for a strain of plankton that interests him. When Nim decides not to go her dad doesnt push. From then on its one disaster after another. Jacks boat is damaged in a storm. He loses his satellite connection and can no longer communicate with his daughter who hangs on to the day he said hed return like a talisman. Nim fights off a cruise ship of avid tourists by making the island appear dangerous. Until this Nim has seemed capable of managing everything herself. The mood of the movie shifts when she seeks outside help and we are reminded shes only 12 years old. The directing team of Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett handle this transition very well making it a subtle shift the audience may not get at first. Breslin does a personality makeover on Nim as she suddenly is made to understand her limitations. As she has grown up in a fantasy world Nim first tries to locate a fictional hero Alex Rover to see if he can find her father. Instead she reaches the author Alexandra Rover. At first the writer seems to be of no help. Suffering from agoraphobia Alexandra is afraid to even step outside her San Francisco Victorian. Foster is hilarious as the frightened writer giving herself pep talks to boost her bravery. Her desire to help this ardent fan finally allows her to fly in helicopters swim with a giant whale and ride a zip wire through treetops in the jungle. Theres a lesson here for kids and maybe adults but the filmmakers dont pound it in. ""Nims Island"" mixes magic with reality when the adventurer Alex turns up at key points. Butler plays him differently from Jack more cocky and convinced of his unlimited physical prowess. This lovely movie is about people testing themselves and finding they are more capable than they thought. Thats a good thing to learn at any age. -- Advisory Frightening storms and potentially dangerous situations.

Nims Island. (PG) Fox/Walden (94 min.) Directed by Mark Levin Jennifer Flackett. With Abigail Breslin Jodie Foster Gerard Butler. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO STARS Walden Media is a family-friendly company thats found a smart niche in childrens films. Sometimes the results have been wonderful (""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" ""Bridge to Terabithia"") and sometimes theyve been dreadful (""Around the World in 80 Days"" ""Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium"") but usually theyve had a message. ""Nims Island"" their latest has a fistful. There are old carpe diem nostrums like ""Seize the moment"" There are Oprah-era cheers like ""Take control of your life"" And mostly -- because its repeated so often that even its own characters get sick of it -- theres the all-purpose self-empowering ""Be the hero of your own story"" If only ""Nims"" hero were more original and its story more concise. Based on the childrens book and set mostly on an uncharted desert isle -- sans Gilligan or Tom Hanks -- its the ""Tempest""-tossed tale of a wise but reclusive man who has raised his daughter far from men. Instead of Caliban and Ariel though she has a sea lion and a pelican for company -- and a devotion to the hardcover adventures of Alex Rover. But then one day her father is lost at sea and dear daughter Nim doesnt know what to do. So she throws out a message in a bottle but 21st-century style -- she sends an email to the swashbuckling Rover. And he gets it -- or rather the author of his wholly fictional adventures does -- and decides to go in search of this pubescent damsel in distress. Too bad that the author is a skinny skittish 40-something lady with an intense fear of well everything. Theres a movie in there -- in fact there are three and the one onscreen quickly bogs down as it cuts among them. Theres the lost-at-sea story with Gerard Butler fighting the waves and his Scottish burr. Theres the kiddie ""Romancing the Stone"" knock-off with a bookish Jodie Foster running around in heels and getting nauseous. And mostly theres a ""Home Alone"" tale with perpetually perky Abigail Breslin trying to drive away some tourists by catapulting them with lizards. Alas not one of the three narratives really works. The scenes of Breslin waging war on fat Australian daytrippers are a silly distraction -- particularly since weve already established that her beloved father is on a leaky boat surrounded by sharks. And the Foster sequences only recycle stale gags about treadmills airports and hand sanitizer. Its also a mistake -- and a change from the book -- to cast Butler as both Breslins father and Rover (who keeps popping up to give his author pep talks). With his fedora and leather jacket he only looks like a wannabe Indiana Jones -- and having the same actor play both parts opens up psychological issues the film really isnt ready to deal with. Breslin is reliably game as the adventuresome Nim though and the animals -- some real some CGI -- are fun to watch. Less enjoyable is seeing the great Foster in a movie with a flatulent sea lion. But then after the four-in-a-row lineup of ""Panic Room"" ""Flight Plan"" ""Inside Man"" and ""The Brave One"" its possible she simply finally wanted to make a movie her two kids could see. Even theyd probably prefer the book. Rating note The film contains mild bathroom humor. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Jodie Foster who actually worked for Disney in the 70s plays Alexandra an agoraphobic novelist who reluctantly ventures forth from her San Francisco apartment. Shes received a plea for help from Nim a young fan on a remote South Seas island who somehow has access to a broadband connection. Nims widowed oceanographer father has disappeared in a storm. She doesnt realize however that Alex the dashing hero of Alexandras books and the author are hardly one and the same. Foster indulges in slapstick for the first time in many years - all this while Alexandra trades mild insults with fictional alter ego Alex played by Gerard Butler in a style that might generously be described as cartoonish. The ""300"" star has a dual role also appearing as Nims ever-resourceful temporarily stranded father. But you have to wonder why if a pet pelican is smart enough to fetch his tool belt why cant the same pelican bring back a message to his worried daughter? Breslins almost-as-resourceful Nim fortunately doesnt ham it up as much as the adults even when she has to cope with a monsoon a volcanic eruption and most frighteningly an invasion of her island paradise by a pirate-themed Australian cruise ship. Maybe its the cheesy special effects but it cant have been easy to make a movie shot on Australias Gold Coast look like it was filmed on Catalina Island and the Disney back lot. Even the animals look phony. Credit husband-and-wife co-directors Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett (of the dimly recalled ""Little Manhattan"") who also adapted an ""acclaimed"" childrens book by Wendy Orr. I walked out of ""Nims Island"" with one burning question How much of the budget was provided by Progresso soup and Purell hand sanitizer both of which receive the most extended product placement in any film released so far this year? In addition to several loving close-ups Foster mentions both products in dialogue.

Joe Neumaier Wednesday June 4 2008 344 PM Nims Island. A girl on a Pacific isle enlists a novelist to help save her father. With Abigail Breslin Jodie Foster. Directors Mark Levin Jennifer Flackett (125). PG Comic action. At area theaters.""Nims Island"" tries to be the kind of girls adventure movie Hollywood needs more of. Familiar story elements are dutifully lined up - resourceful kid missing father a mentor who needs lessons in heroism - and it seems like everything will just tumble and click like dominoes.But then it loses its way and just when the movie needs real girl power it leaves its heroine stranded. A cute pre-title sequence shows how 11-year-old Nim (Abigail Breslin) lost her mom to the sea as a toddler. She and her dad (Gerard Butler) then sailed the world until they settled on an unpopulated South Pacific island so that he can continue his marine biology studies and she can frolic with animals. A supply boat gives them everything they need which for Nim is the latest best seller by swashbuckling writer Alex Rover. When her father disappears and the island is besieged by wealthy vacationers spoiling its natural beauty Nime-mails her author-hero and asks for help. Trouble is ""Alex Rover"" is the fictional Indiana Jones-like creation of the reclusive Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster) who cant leave her San Francisco house much less answer a distress call. But the fearful Alexandra is ready to take a chance. ""Nims Island"" is a female version of those 60s and 70s live-action Disney movies that involved treehouses bumbling villains and ingenious contraptions clearly what co-writers/directors Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett were aiming for. In contrast to those early Disney treats nothing really happens on ""Nims Island."" Alexandra needs to overcome the fear of her journey but seeing her do just that isnt rewarding. By the time she should have sand between her toes the script traps her in Expedia-land as Nim thwarts the invaders. The trickiest twist involves a pretend Alex (also Butler in a fedora) interacting with Alexandra urging her to finally live her life. It works but it overtakes Nims story. Levin and Flackett had a great feel for kids POV in 2005s ""Little Manhattan""; they transplant that here. Everything looks bright overpuffed and unreal. Foster seems to be having real fun twitching and skittering around that steel jaw of hers comically tense. But this family movie shouldnt be about a shut-in trying to get from A to B; it needs to be about an unconventional girl growing up and helping an equally unconventional grownup cut loose on a volcanic island. Sadly ""Nims Island"" is a missed opportunity. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its heroine is a dewy 10-year-old girl. Its hero is a handsome swashbuckler. Its backdrop is a sunny Pacific isle. Its villains arrive on a pirate ship (in a manner of speaking). But theres one component just one little twist that adds a tingle of rattled urban idiosyncrasy to this idyllic setting the arrival of a chronically delusional obsessive-compulsive-agoraphobic germophobe from San Francisco. Im pretty sure thats not a standard character in most childhood fables. Her name is Alexandra Frost. Jodie Foster plays her and if you think the presence of a stern-jawed Oscar winner lends the film some artsy cred youre wrong. She seems to understand her purpose here to go altogether crackers in service to the plot which is best described as the aforesaid agoraphobes prolonged intervention by one of her own delusions. That would be ``Alex Rover (Gerard Butler) the Indiana Jonesy alter-ego who ``narrates Alexandras best-selling adventure yarns. He is intrepid ill-shaven opinionated and yummy. Chief among his fans is young Nim (Abigail Breslin an Oscar nominee in her own right for Little Miss Sunshine) who lives on a remote South Pacific island with her marine-biologist dad Jack (also Butler) and abundant friendly wildlife. Nims life is perfect until Jack heads off alone in his sailboat in search of plankton. While hes gone Nim gets an e-mail from Alexandra asking about the islands volcano - she wants to know if it actually bubbles with lava - and the girl injures herself rappelling down its side. The wound gets icky; she gets scared. But she cant reach her father whos been side-swiped by a monsoon and instead asks Alexandra to come to the rescue. Except Nim thinks shes addressing ``Alex not Alexandra. And Alexandra hasnt left her apartment in months. And her only hope is a gabby hallucination in leather half-gloves. ``Be the hero of your own life story. . . Come on a road trip with me he urges. She finally complies armed with bottles of hand sanitizer. So it goes. There are boats planes a helicopter a turtle a sea lion a lizard called Fred and a solicitous plot-ministering pelican named Galileo. There are overweight tourists and invading porta-potties. There are many scenes in which Alexandra unaccustomed to the cumulative indignities of travel freaks out on public transit. And through it all there is the disarming and valiant Nim who puts on a brave face but clearly misses her daddy. Based on the childrens book by Wendy Orr and Kerry Millard the film was co-directed by Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin who last collaborated (she as writer he as director) on the 2005 grade-school romance Little Manhattan. That was a smaller more winning film about a big-hearted kid on a different lonely island. Their new movie veers from Little Manhattans prepubescent cityscape to Nims sun-kissed paradise but both films are dotted with brief animations and other imaginary fugues exploring the minds and hearts of children (and the agitated mental state of one neurotic grown-up). An undefined mysticism pervades the story including a hint of Lost-like gibbering that suggests a sentient land mass. And of course the premise is absurd Globe-trotting father-daughter teams dont often lay claim to abandoned tropical islands and I cant imagine a blissed-out childhood (or adulthood) resulting when they do. But the films chief problem isnt its fantasy elements; its the lack of real magic in their telling. Nims Island is a pleasant-enough jaunt for a family outing but it never fully arrives at that ``perfect secret world. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mainstays No Tools 6-Cube Storage Shelf for 20 + pickup at...

"Nims Island Implausible voyage | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsNims Island Implausible voyage Since Nims Island revolves around the adventures of an 11-year-old girl named Nim who lives on an island in the South Pacific and plays with her animal friends such as Fred the iguana Selkie the sea lion and Galileo the pelican it falls under the category of ""childrens movie.""Nim (Abigail Breslin) and Selkie the sea lion go for a swim in the Sea of Suspended Disbelief.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. April 4 2008 Nims Island (out of 4)Starring Jodie Foster Abigail Breslin and Gerard Butler. Directed by Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin. 96 minutes. At major theatres. PG Since Nims Island revolves around the adventures of an 11-year-old girl named Nim who lives on an island in the South Pacific and plays with her animal friends such as Fred the iguana Selkie the sea lion and Galileo the pelican it falls under the category of ""childrens movie.""Children may well find it absorbing with its fast-paced action and lush travel-poster cinematography. Parents may also be assured there is nothing off-putting in the movie beyond a Fear Factor-like scene in which Jodie Foster forces herself to eat fried worms. She finds them ""chewy."" That said the movie is not particularly rewarding for adults or children who believe that even a tale of fantastic events should be governed by plausibility. The action opens with Nim played by Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) who also stars in this years Definitely Maybe and who seems to have acquired the patent on precocious movie children who make adults look like klutzes.Shes living on her island with her scientist and widower dad (Gerard Butler). These two enjoy an idyllic life on their ""own secret world"" although its not entirely secret since they periodically receive supplies from a visiting boat and it is not entirely isolated since they use email regularly.One fine day the father sails off to study some plankton promising to be back in two days. Unfortunately he runs into a monsoon which leaves his boat crippled and adrift. Meanwhile to the horror of Nim the captain of a cruise ship lands with his mates and decides to convert this supposedly uninhabited island into a tourist paradise. Nim whose characteristic look is one of bright-eyed triumph decides to scare off the cruise ship invaders with the help of Fred and Selkie. Finding her father is another matter.Fearing the worst from his absence she emails Alex Rover an Indiana Jones figure who is the adventurer hero of a series of novels unrivalled in his ability to wriggle out of the most hopeless fictional situations. Nim does not know that Alex is actually Alexandra (Foster) an agoraphobic writer who refuses to venture outside her apartment and panics in the face of a harmless spider. This is where the movie gets complicated. Butler doubles in the film as the spirit of Alex Rover continually hectoring his creator Foster to try a little of the derring-do of her creation. Moved by Nims email and taking to heart the advice of her imaginary friend Rover finally ventures out of her apartment. Not only that she flies to the South Pacific and takes a boat to Nims island spreading havoc around her through her ceaseless agitation and pratfalls. Apparently this is how agoraphobics who finally get out of doors behave. The movie is as confused as she is. Is it a fantasy or a realistic drama? Fred Selkie and Galileo are creatures of fantasy but the movie also insists on the primacy of good old earth-bound science and technology. Neither the fantasy animals nor the mechanical devices rigged by humans seem realistic. Nothing seems realistic. At one point Nim manages to nudge a huge boulder into the mouth of a volcano releasing huge clouds of gas and ash. Somehow Nim remains unscathed by these belching clouds. The movie wants to deliver a message of some sort. ""Come on Mother Nature"" hollers Nims father when a favourable wind wafts him temporarily homeward - the same Mother Nature that shortly before did her best to kill him. Does he really think Mother Nature is kindly? Only people who have computers and satellite telephones believe that. And by the way who is financing his research into plankton? Not that I want to get picky. The insistence on delivering a message however makes pointing out its makeshift contrivances irresistible.

The movie is a slapdash amalgam of competing visual and storytelling styles bizarre acting egregious product placement (particularly for National Geographic) and negative stereotypes. Nim (Abigail Breslin) is a young girl who lives on a remote South Pacific island with her widowed scientist father (Gerard Butler) and her animal friends -- an iguana a sea lion and a pelican. Dads boat is caught in a storm leaving Nim to defend herself against tourists volcanoes and another monsoon all in the course of a few days. Nims favorite books are a series of adventures starring Alex Rider (Butler again) an Indiana Jones type who is always in peril. Like the Spielberg movies theyre aping these tales (and consequently this film) feature the usual hidebound villains -- snarling Arabs or half-naked natives eager to sacrifice our hero. Alone and worried Nim sends an e-mail to Alexandra Rider (Jodie Foster) the series reclusive author who flies out to save the girl despite suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and agoraphobia. Foster has an eagerness that borders on mania acting like someone uncomfortable with children but who is forced to entertain them for an afternoon. As in ""300"" Butler roars or grins maniacally at times oozing what is supposed to be charm but comes closer to menace. ""Nims Island"" begins with the promise of some educational dialogue with interesting people but quickly devolves into pseudoscience and stereotype. Her pets are at once beloved and then casually used as weapons; hurling her iguana across the treetops and into the faces of the evil tourists cant be healthy for the poor beast. The film also suggests that white scientists and their self-absorbed children are the best stewards of these remote islands not the Micronesians who live nearby (and who are themselves stereotyped). And the overweight cruise-ship tourists who visit Nims home are horrible caricatures. NIMS ISLAND  out of 4 stars Rated PG for mild adventure action and brief language. Ultimately ""Nims Island"" with its myriad nonprofit tie-ins (which include National Wildlife Federation and Marine Sanctuaries among many others) is nothing more than a bunch of poor ideas tossed together to create the illusion of imagination and environmental concern but possessing precious little of both.

Ask Movie Mom Click here Trailer Ace the Case with Susan Sarandon Posted by Nell Minow 10-year old Olivia and her 17-year old brother are left home alone when their Mom goes on a business trip for the weekend. Olivia sees a young woman being kidnapped on the empty New York City streets. Her brother doesnt believe her and neither do the cops. So Olivia starts investigating on her own trying to persuade a cynical detective (Susan Sarandon) that she is telling the truth.

If we dont know where we are there may be jokes but it is not truly comedy. Writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are not people with a lot of ideas. Their ""21 and Over"" was pretty much the same movie as their ""Hangover."" And the big innovation here is that this time its girls-gone-wild instead of boys. But it plays like it was inspired by a couple of womens magazine articles about the impossibility of ""having it all."" The movie says it comes down on the side of not judging other mothers those who seem to be losing it and those who seem to be holding it together. The message is that its good to forgive yourself for not being able to be perfect all the time. And its important to understand that loving your children means letting them learn to be responsible and not doing everything for them. But those good thoughts are undercut by the unexpectedly sour triumph of the main characters with antagonists who must be shown as spineless or pitiful. The reality of womens lives is a target-rich environment for comedy and the reality of mothers lives is especially so. But this script is so lazy that it does not meet the level of basic cable sitcoms for originality and wit. They have more in 22 minutes than ""Bad Moms"" does in 101. This is a movie that is supposed to be about female empowerment. There are two specific instances that involve women telling their cartoonishly awful husbands that they need to take more responsibility for their children and their households. And yet this is a movie that consistently shows the PTA as apparently entirely made up of women with the exception of one man who is shown at a PTA meeting specifically so he can be humiliated in public by his wife. Funny. amiright? And this is a school that apparently includes elementary middle and possibly high school students does not notice when a mother does a childs homework and has a pot-smoking principal who cant stand up to the President of the PTA. What? ""Hangover"" worked because most of the movie was about dealing with the horrible consequences of a major sort-of-accidental bender. ""Bad Moms"" tries to persuade us that a bender and attendant irresponsible behavior are signs of liberation. The bender is a mild one no tigers or tooth extractions. On the other hand the issue of money is raised but in the kind of fairy tale way that suggests no one connected with the movie has had to think about how to pay for groceries -- or damage inflicted on a grocery store -- in a very long time. Were supposed to believe them when they talk about how much they love their kids and would do anything for them but they dont really seem to enjoy or support them. And newsflash -- jokes about foreskins butt stuff and girl-on-girl kisses as a sign of rebellion and edginess are so 1998. The one-dimensional characters are as follows Mila Kunis plays Amy the exhausted mom of two who boots out her childish cheating husband. Shes had no sex in years. Kristen Bell is Kiki the exhausted mom of four whose husband treats her like Cinderella. They have sex once a week (""After ""Blue Bloods"") but he is not very uh excited or exciting. And Kathryn Hahn is Carla the happy unreliable slut who does not even know what a standardized test is much less whether her son has to take and pass them. She talks about sex all the time but does not seem to be having any either. Christina Applegate is Gwendolyn the Mean Girl (with henchmen played by Jada Pinkett-Smith and ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo (who should have done a major rewrite here). One thing Lucas and Moore get right is the combination of the humblebrag and the insult-wrapped in a compliment handed out by the ladies who run the school. Yes when they flutter their eyelashes and say ""I dont know how you do it"" to Amy she understands that they mean ""Youre doing it badly."" And there is a lot to be said about impossible standards and judgey people especially when it comes to parenting. But that requires actually saying something not just pointing it out. Amy blows her top decides not to try to be everything to everyone any more and then when Gwendolyn lashes back involving Amys daughter (in the Bizarro world of this movie the head of the PTA is in charge of everything in the school) Amy decides to run against her on a platform similar to but less authentic than that of Tammy in ""Election."" Even in a PTA election someone has to propose something more than ""lets do less and not judge each other."" All four women are brilliant actors and comedians and make as much of this material as they can but they all deserve much better. Jay Hernandez transcends the thankless role of the hot guy making him the only male in the film who is not completely infantilized. Someone needs to put him in a leading man role. And someone needs to start putting women in the leading role of writing and directing stories about women or at least men who can do better than this. NOTE The highlight of the movie is the series of conversations over the credits with the actresses and their real-life mothers filled with exactly the wit and heart missing from most of the film. Parents should know that this film is crude and explicit language throughout including very strong and crude language drinking drugs sexual references and explicit nudity and comic peril and violence. Family discussion Who is responsible for the standard the moms felt they had to live up to? How would this be different if it was about dads?

During the boring parts of this movie I played a game I made up that I called ""Same or Different."" For example in one of the earlier Bourne movies our hero the once-amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) grabbed a limited-use anonymous cell phone for a particularly clever maneuver. In this one he grabs a small tracking device handily left out in a bowl like peanuts at a bar for happy hour. Same or different? Different because the first one was plausible and this one was ridiculous. The earlier films had exceptionally well-staged fight scenes that felt like real people who get out of breath and hurt each other and jockey for advantage. In the first moments of this film in addition to completely unnecessary jumps between five different locations around the world for no purpose he knocks out an enormous professional fighter with one punch. Same or different? Same answer as above.  And if we distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys by how much collateral damage they inflict on the world -- how many innocent bystanders get killed the answer here is more same than different. There are franchise films made for fan service and then there are those that do not even service the fans are merely a cash grab and retroactively devalue the franchise. This is a movie that asks us to believe that the head of the CIA and a Mark Zuckerberg-young titan of the worlds coolest social media company a sort of cross between Google and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat decide to have a conversation of the utmost secrecy in a posh Washington DC restaurant the kind where everyone eavesdrops on the big shots at the next table especially reporters politicians and Hill staffers. The first three Bourne films transcended the action/spy genre with a gritty almost intimate feel far from the glossiness of James Bond and with an expanding deepening storyline that as the then-LA Times critic Manohla Dargis said began with the existential in ""Identity"" (Who am I?) extended to the moral in ""Supremacy"" (What did I do?). With the third film the question of culpability extended to the larger ""I"" of the government Who are we and what have we done? We will put aside for the moment the non-Bourne ""Bourne"" which mistakenly went in the direction of a secret government program that was more ""Captain America"" than Bourne with a mysterious ability-enhancing drug that removed the somber reality that resonated with the era of waterboarding and Abu Ghraib. There is plenty to explore and attempt to expiate now and the movie tries to touch on contemporary issues explored in far more compelling -- and terrifying -- terms in documentaries like Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"" and ""Zero Days."" It just doesnt do anything interesting with them while it is piling improbable motivations and preposterous situations almost as high as the carnage and wrecked cars. Parents should know that this film has constant spy-related action-style peril and violence many characters injured and killed including many innocent bystanders themes of government corruption and some strong language. Family discussion Who should decide the balance between privacy and security and how much information about those decisions should be public? What real-life events inspired this story?

Fields advice about not working with children and animals Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett follow up their appealing tween romance Little Manhattan with the anemic tween action-adventure Nims Island. Abigail Breslin is Nim a resourceful 11-year-old Robin Crusoe who flourishes on a remote South Pacific isle with her father Jack (Gerard Butler) a marine biologist. Lonely? Not Nim whose menagerie includes a cuddly sea lion a chatty bearded dragon and an ESP-gifted pelican. Equipped with satellite dishes her island has full wireless Internet and Skype capabilities. The film scores points for its enticing scenery - waves lapping at the shore of Australias verdant Gold Coast - which is storybook-lush. It scores again as a family-friendly tale that focuses not on a young girls body but rather on her strength and spirit. And its magic when it shows how reading transports the reader inspiring her to be her own hero. The story though - more accurately the three parallel stories - has the unfortunate effect of diluting its assets. For much of the film Nim is alone on the island with her father marooned at sea. During this stretch Nims only human connection is via e-mail with agoraphobic adventure novelist Alex Rover (Jodie Foster). Thus we have Nim confiding in her animals Jack beseeching the weather gods and Alex talking to her computer screen. While this might be an accurate representation of how modern technology isolates us as it connects us it is near-fatal to the film. Here are three fine actors each performing in a vacuum. Breslin so memorable in Little Miss Sunshine suffers the most. Skilled and reactive with humans she doesnt quite muster the same engagement with her finned and flippered costars here. Nor does she have the nimble physicality of AnnaSophia Robb (or the young Jodie Foster) that might have anchored her performance. The adult Foster is many things but slapstick comedian is not one of them. Give her this As an adventure writer too frightened to leave her house she gamely pratfalls splatfalls and slipsides all the while with a rictus grin. Of Butler who stole hearts as the Phantom of the Opera and made them race as King Leonidas in 300 I confess that his charms elude me. To those in his legion of female fans who have e-mailed asking whether he takes his shirt off (he plays both Nims father and the Indy Jones-ish fiction hero she longs for) I didnt notice. Keep your shirts on ladies. You dont need to rent a child to see this mildly diverting if middling adventure. Nims Island 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett. Distributed by 20th Century Fox. With Abigail Breslin Jodie Foster and Gerard Butler. Running time 1 hour 35 mins.

Like a lush tropical getaway that promises paradise and delivers something closer to purgatory ""Nims Island"" is a picturesque adventure-comedy that quickly capsizes under the weight of its obnoxious slapstick pedestrian dialogue and general unwillingness to rise above stock ideas and situations. Recasting Robinson Crusoe as a young 21st-century heroine and confirming Walden Medias rep as a maker of slick professional family entertainments of highly variable quality this strictly-for-kids Fox release should ride the significant appeal of stars Abigail Breslin and Jodie Foster to make midsize B.O. waves. Theres a difference between skewing toward young audiences and targeting dimwits of all ages and too often this adaptation of Wendy Orrs 1999 novel veers toward the latter. As directed by the husband-and-wife team of Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett (""Little Manhattan"") who share scripting chores with Joseph Kwong and producer Paula Mazur ""Nims Island"" is much easier on the eyes than it is on the ears. Its the sort of movie that compels its characters to recap plot points that werent exactly mind-bending the first time read messages aloud even when the words are perfectly legible onscreen and never miss an opportunity to overstate the obvious. Breslin plays plucky prepubescent tyke Nim Rusoe (get it?) who for as long as she can recall has lived happily with her scientist-writer dad Jack (Gerard Butler) in a large treehouse -- handily outfitted with electricity and high-speed Internet -- on an uncharted Pacific island. But when a violent storm hits and Jack is lost at sea Nim seeks help through a chance correspondence with a person she thinks is the great explorer Alex Rover. Trouble is shes actually exchanging emails with Alexandra Rover (Foster) a severely agoraphobic San Francisco author who couldnt be more different from the Indiana Jones-style hero she writes about in her bestselling adventure novels. But Alexandra touched by the girls pleas and spurred on by visions of Alex (also played by Butler) only she can see decides to break out of her shut-in existence find her way to the island and inevitably become the mother Nim never knew. (Latter was apparently swallowed by a whale shortly after Nims birth as recounted in a five-minute prologue and cloyingly referenced throughout.) Even the journey to this halfway mark seems to tax the films resources to the point of exhaustion as the story bogs down in an excess of dialogue (some of it expository most of it just embarrassing) half-hearted action-adventure mayhem the usual supporting cast of friendly wildlife and hyperactive cross-cutting among the principal characters. While Nim attempts to contact her father and ward off some opportunistic island crashers Alexandra trips bumbles and vomits her way across the Pacific affording Foster a rare opportunity to flex her physical-comedy muscles. But bearing the brunt of the pics increasingly tiresome pratfalls she flexes rather too hard and too often. Breslin is appealing and sparky as always but not much more in this lackluster addition to her resume and her characters tilt toward bratty self-entitlement in the second act underscores the reality that Nims wilderness existence is too cushy by half a spoiled Girl Scouts castaway fantasy. Butler for his part is both figuratively and literally at sea as his Jack is forced to spend a ridiculous length of screen time hanging on for dear life. Lenser Stuart Dryburgh takes full advantage of the widescreen to frame the gorgeous sunsets and beaches of Australias Gold Coast and Hinchinbrook Island. Production designer Barry Robison created the paper puppets and miniatures used in the lovely opening and end-credits sequences although the latter wouldve benefited from a more imaginative song choice than U2s ""Beautiful Day."" Pics souped-up high-tech ""Swiss Family Robinson"" aesthetic is borne out by an alarming number of product placements When Nim and Alexandra exchange emails the Apple logos on their computers seem to glow in unison as clear a sign as any that theyre destined to live happily ever after.

Nims Island is different. The story of a spunky young girl alone on an island who enlists the help of a woman (whos less emotionally mature than the girl) offers girl power in heavy doses. Thats a good thing. Nim isnt Indiana Jones exactly and she doesnt have to be. Shes a little girl growing up in unusual circumstances who hits a rough patch and relies on her wits and skills to ride it out. Huh. Maybe she is Indiana Jones. OK not really. But Alex Rover is almost. Hes the fictional hero in the books loved by Nim Rusoe (Abigail Breslin) the precocious daughter of Jack (Gerard Butler who also plays Alex in fantasy sequences). They live on an off-the-map island where Jack studies amoebas and whatnot and Nim grows up amid tropical flora and fauna. Its while Nim is reading the latest Alex Rover adventure that Jack whos searching for a new species or some such gets stranded at sea. Nim becomes understandably worried and must face severe storms while tending to a nasty cut on her leg. So she e-mails Alex Rover - who unbeknownst to her is actually Alexandra Rover (Jodie Foster) the novelist who created Alex. The author can offer only so much help. Shes agoraphobic and can barely bring herself to get her mail. But Nims troubles worsen and Rover realizes shes going to have to step outside her closed-off world and into Nims wide-open one. (She does this with the help of her hero creation whos always ready with a lacerating quip to keep her on her toes.) At this point Nims Island becomes a sort of cut-rate travel comedy with Foster milking the stranger-in-a-strange-land bit for all its worth. Meanwhile Nim must cope not just with the elements and her injury but with a boatload of ugly tourists who want to turn her island into a port-a-potty-studded stopover. And Jack with the help of some of Nims animal friends works to repair his boat so that he can get back home. Nims Island is a bit of a throwback. Although Internet access play a role setting the film on a remote island takes us back to simpler times and simpler films. The story is a little silly and a lot far-fetched but its innocence goes a long way toward overcoming all that. If youre a young girl in fact you wont mind the leaps of logic and faith a bit. Why would you? Nims Island is an old-fashioned kids movie. Parents might find flaws but the 12-and-younger set will find characters and a movie worth rooting for.
