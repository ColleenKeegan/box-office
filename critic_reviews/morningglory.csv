Her policy meant that she didnt get the chance to see how the passing years and age can change ones perceptions and deepen ones appreciation for some movies on repeat viewings -- or the reverse. For example re-watching ""Gone With the Wind"" a few years back I was struck by how Mammy (Hattie McDaniel in her Oscar-winning performance) is so clearly the dramas moral center. This was not something my 13-year-old self picked up on the first time -- then it was all about Scarlett and Rhett. Similarly when I viewed ""The Graduate"" as a 17-year-old in a revival house I found myself identifying with Dustin Hoffmans baffled Benjamin.  Seeing it again 25 years later it was all about Anne Bancrofts Mrs. Robinson. Rather than seeming predatory she now struck me as a tragic figure stuck in a life and marriage she rued. But memory can also give a burnished glow to films that may not deserve it. How many movies about kooks and crazy people who are -- wait for it -- really the sane ones fail to charm upon repeat viewing? Im thinking specifically of two films from the 1960s ""A Thousand Clowns"" and ""King of Hearts"" but its a formula Hollywood never tires of revisiting. Or consider ""Five Easy Pieces"" in which Jack Nicholson played one of the 70s seminal anti-heroes and was perceived as admirable at the time for rejecting a life of privilege. Viewed now he seems like an aimless spoiled rich kid whos a nasty misogynist to boot. (Though the chicken salad sandwich scene in the coffee shop is still a favorite.) A movie that was of the moment but has stood the test of time is 1987s ""Broadcast News."" Director-writer James L. Brooks captured the adrenaline rush of producing TV news but also the ethical and monetary conflicts that were roiling the industry at the time. And Holly Hunters breakout performance as an ambitious talented producer was a revelation marking her as a comer the same way as Tom Cruise in ""Risky Business"" or Angela Bassett in ""Whats Love Got to Do With It?"" I especially bring up ""Broadcast News"" because this weeks new ""Morning Glory"" in which a young female TV producer tries to rescue a networks ratings-anemic morning show bumps headlong against memories of ""Broadcast News"" with its focus on the merits of soft versus hard news. Its ""Morning Glory"" that comes out wanting. Rachel McAdams plays Becky Fuller a spunky workaholic TV producer who is given the unenviable job of trying to goose the ratings of a perennially cellar-dwelling morning news show. After finding a loophole in his contract she presses Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) a respected ex-primetime anchorman into service as co-host with the shows long-suffering Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) a former Miss Arizona. The two hosts bicker endlessly both on-air and off (offering several of the movies best scenes) while Becky and Mike whos proudly and cantankerously old school debate the merits of investigative news versus cooking segments. The more Becky resorts to outrageous stunts (having the weatherman ride a roller coaster live and sky dive) the higher the shows ratings climb. The comedy directed by Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") and written by Aline Brosh McKenna (""The Devil Wears Prada"") starts off well but then mostly just spins its wheels. Theres a couldnt-care-less romance between Becky and another producer (Patrick Wilson) which is superfluous since the movies real romance while strictly platonic is between Becky and Mike as each comes grudgingly to respect the others point of view. The movie makes good use of its New York locations and the cast are all likable pros. Its just that unlike ""Broadcast News"" nothing seems especially fresh here and little is at stake. If anything ""Glory"" seems to endorse what Fords character early on dismisses as ""fluffy news."" And thats the difference between the two movies ""Glory"" is essentially a fluffy movie. ""Broadcast News"" while entertaining had real bite. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Talk about well-kept-- and welcome--surprises. Tony Scotts latest thriller turns out to be pure cinema in the classic sense of the term. Its a motion picture about motion an action symphony that gives new meaning to the notion of a one-track mind. Denzel Washington and and Chris Pine race to stop a locamotive loaded with toxic cargo in this action movie directed by Tony Scott. The premise is simple to the point of primal--a runaway freight train hurtling through Pennsylvania with a load of lethal chemicals and no one in the locomotive. On the same track heading toward it is another freight train pulled by a locomotive with the movies co-stars at the controls Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the rookie conductor. (Oh yes the runaway freight train which weighs a million tons also threatens to collide with a passenger train full of children on a school outing.) Sure the details seem absurd and the premise sounds familiar; there was even a film--an impressive achievement in its own right--called ""Runaway Train"" 25 years ago. But youve got to see this new one to appreciate how full fresh smart terse funny genuinely thrilling and ultimately original it is. More Speakeasy Interview with Unstoppable Director Tony Scott And how beautiful. One stunning image outdoes another in the hurtling circling swooping cinematography of Ben Seresin a New Zealander whose palette is restrained but never suppressed. (The imagery as a whole evokes the railroad photography of the 1930s and 1940s even though the story is set in the present or Margaret Bourke-Whites industrial photos for Life magazine.) ENLARGE Denzel Washington in the middle of the action in Unstoppable. Twentieth Century Fox And how loud. Much of the movies thunderous effect depends on subwoofers those enormously powerful speakers that can shake a theater from its floor to its rafters. Ive been a chronic complainer about assaultive sound levels in multiplex auditoriums. Action directors--including Mr. Scott--have become subwoofer junkies. They have used and abused audio technology in order to elevate countless car crashes and other collisions to pseudo-epic status. The difference here is that the films sonic underpinnings--basso signatures of gigantic machines--are justified by a drama that truly does have an epic feel. One of the movies many distinctions is an almost uncanny combination of pounding pace and carefully regulated narrative development. The catastrophe-to-be is quickly set in motion by a succession of small screw-ups each depicted concisely. Its Murphys law playing out at breathtaking speed; the only certainty is that more things will go wrong and thats the essence of suspenseful uncertainty. While the pace of events accelerates the movie keeps turning to unhurried vignettes of its main characters Mr. Pines cocky newcomer Will Colson and Mr. Washingtons vastly knowledgeable Frank Barnes. (Nearly half of the 100-minute running time flies by before they tackle their fateful task of averting catastrophe.) Here again the rookie-veteran formula is familiar yet the script a work of minimalist art by Mark Bomback turns it into something new. ""Unstoppable"" is not only a prodigy of kinetic energy but an eloquently understated tribute to working men and women who do their jobs well despite callous or incompetent managers and to older workers with irreplaceable experience--Frank Barnes being a perfect example--who face the corporate lunacy of forced retirement. The film is a celebration of expertise and in more ways than one given the example of its director. Mr. Scott has been making movies for four decades (this is his fifth with Mr. Washington) though his commercial breakthrough didnt come until ""Top Gun"" in 1986. I have long admired his technical skill and his gift for working with actors but have often recoiled from what Ive seen as frenetic style in the service of shamelessly manipulative substance. He ""holds his audience hostage to runaway technique"" I wrote last year on the occasion of his previous film which was oddly enough a hyperactive remake of ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Its odd because ""Pelham"" was also a train movie--a hijacked-subway train movie with Mr. Washington as a Transit Authority dispatcher rather than an engineer. Yet its also fascinating because many of the same techniques that Mr. Scott has wielded with such flamboyance in the past--and with such hollow results in ""Pelham""-- come together as never before in ""Unstoppable."" His new movie has it all--a compelling idea on a par with the premise of ""Speed""; a screenplay that will resonate just as deeply as those subwoofers with a wide range of moviegoers; the romance of old-fashioned transportation; the excitement of older-fashioned special effects (live action and meticulous model work have reduced computer-generated trickery to an invisible minimum) a canvas as big as all outdoors (in contrast to the claustrophobic ""Pelham"") and a steadfast sense of reality including over-the-top TV news coverage portrayed with under-the-top authenticity--even though the movies zestful spirit leads to ever more extravagant action. (In a single dazzling scene the screen is filled with an onrushing train scores of emergency vehicles a flock of TV choppers in an azure sky and in the foreground the gyrating bodies of terrified horses.) Mr. Washington has never been more likable or convincingly heroic. Sometimes hes simultaneously intense and self-effacing proof of his own expertise in the tricky profession of being a star. ""Unstoppable"" will be a turning point in Mr. Pines career; he gives a star performance that is notable for its subtlety simplicity and unforced strength. Thanks to the bond between them the movie more than gets away with conversational interludes in which Will and Frank discuss life and love. In an exceptional cast Rosario Dawson is Connie a yardmaster who knows her stuff and has the courage to insist on it; Kevin Corrigan is an intelligent and intuitive federal safety inspector; Ethan Suplee is a dim-bulb threat to safety in the marshaling yard; Kevin Dunn is an invincibly dense manager and Lew Temple is a welder who seizes the limelight. The production was designed by Chris Seagers. Harry Gregson-Williams did the original music. The film was edited--brilliantly--by Robert Duffy and Chris Lebenzon. Client 9 The Rise And Fall of Eliot Spitzer This documentary explores the rise and fall of former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. Say what you will about Eliot Spitzer hes a marvelous subject for a documentary and Alex Gibney has made a film worthy of him; it goes into national release Friday. The first part of the title explains itself although it may be news to you as it was to me that the high-end hookers of the Emperors Club VIP were ranked by diamonds instead of stars and just like any consumer product on Amazon.com rated by user reviews. (The client number was revealed by a federal affidavit in the case against the club.) The titles second part is obvious too though no rise in contemporary politics was ever swifter and no fall more ignominious. The surprises in Mr. Gibneys movie are its subjects candor limited mainly by the rigidity of his personality and the strength of its contention that Mr. Spitzer was brought down not only by his sexual follies but by the formidable enemies he made on the way up. ENLARGE Silda Spitzer and her embattled husband Eliot in Client 9. Magnolia Pictures For anyone interested in those follies--that means pretty much everyone doesnt it?--""Client 9"" offers a dramatized reading of an account provided by the hooker he favored not Ashley Dupre who has made a media career out of a one-night stand but a woman who called herself Angelina during the time the former Sheriff of Wall Street was governor of New York. Since Angelina declined to be on camera her words are performed by a bright and attractive actress (Wrenn Schmidt) who may have made her real-life character a bit too bright though maybe not; Angelinas physical allure is never at issue. For those interested in high-end politics a sport that makes professional football look polite the film offers an incomparable gallery of rogues knaves and self-styled knights. At center stage is Mr. Spitzer of course managing to be marginally less off-putting than you might imagine. We also meet Joe Bruno a former majority leader of the New York State Senate; Hank Greenberg the former head of AIG; Ken Langone a billionaire businessman and a former director of the New York Stock Exchange and the political consultant and dirty trickster Roger Stone. Men like these the movie shows must not be taken on lightly. Morning Glory Rachel McAdams Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford star in ""Morning Glory"" a comedy about the cast of a struggling television morning show. In this silly comedy which was directed by Roger Michell from a scatterbrained script by Aline Brosh McKenna a spunky young TV producer persuades a grumpy living legend to co-anchor an early-morning talk show. The producer Becky is played by Rachel McAdams whos perfectly lovely when shes allowed to be calm. Unfortunately she doesnt get her allowance until the very end when all is lost. The living legend a cross between Edward R. Murrow and Mike Wallace is played by Harrison Ford whose grumpiness seems hermetic and complete; did no one tell him it was OK to be a tiny bit likable? (Jeff Goldblum as an executive at Beckys failing network plays morose by looking morose.) This production is a mess for many reasons most of them having to do with its frantic efforts to be funny. And Ms. McAdams isnt the only offender on this count Diane Keatons longtime morning host is frantic too. The most basic of the movies problems though is its confusion about who Becky is. The heroine as presented is an entry-level monster a younger version of the network executive played by Faye Dunaway in ""Network."" Beckys ambition knows no bounds; neither does her appetite for trivial programming. Yet the writer and director seem to think that shes mostly adorable and pull her back from the brink of self-knowledge. ""Morning Glory"" turns the dubious trick of trivializing trivialization. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com. DVD FOCUS Man on Fire (2004) ENLARGE Tony Scott directed this revenge fantasy from a sharp-witted script by Brian Helgeland. Denzel Washington is Creasy a has-been assassin who hires on in Mexico City as the bodyguard of a precocious 9-year-old named Pita (Dakota Fanning). The first part deals affectingly with a growing bond between the child and her protector. The second sparked by Pitas kidnapping and apparent death at the hands of her abductors is a long blast of brutal energy. Mr. Scotts game here is high-intensity manipulation. You may not like it but you know youve seen action after hes finished working you over. Star Trek (2009) Chris Pine plays the young James Kirk in J.J. Abramss elegant return to the legends beginnings. Each of the now-iconic members of the USS Enterprises crew gets rising-star treatment but in the best of the productions bold strokes Leonard Nimoy closes the circle by giving a lovely layered performance in the role he said hed never play again. Thanks to the intricate manipulation of time (which is as always barely fathomable) the elder Spock dubbed Spock Prime does not merely come on board but serves as the movies heart and soul. The Notebook (2004) Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are passionate young lovers Allie and Noah while Gena Rowlands and James Garner are the elders they become. (Theyre near the end of their days and her memory is almost gone.) Ripe with feeling and lush with physical beauty this love story swings confidently between age and youth--though youth is its main focus--and avoids every trap along the way. Nick Cassavetes directed impeccably from an adaptation by Jeremy Leven and Jan Sardi of a novel by Nicholas Sparks. Robert Fraisse was the cinematographer. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Comments Morning Glory Rated PG-13  102 minutes  2010 Canned from her job in New Jersey a plucky TV producer (Rachel McAdams) lands a gig at the fourth-rated morning show in New York; as supervising producer she fires the news anchor and coerces a grouchy journalism legend (Harrison Ford) into joining the lightweight talent roster. McAdams is typically effervescent here but she cant rescue this weak comedy from a wooden Ford whose stick-up-the-ass character is unimaginatively goosed by screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (27 Dresses The Devil Wears Prada). Diane Keaton costars as Fords partner on the broadcast but not even the pairing of these eminently cranky old actors does much to enliven the movies familiar TV-production gags. Roger Michell directed; with Jeff Goldblum as the heroines boss and Patrick Wilson as the ill-defined love interest. By J.R. Jones Director Roger MichellProducer J.J.

McAdams is every bit as endearing though and pulls fewer faces. Chasing after TV divas with outsize egos she can look like a klutz without looking like a moron as if only an unconflicted opportunist could handle so absurd a job with aplomb as if her clumsiness were a sign of integrity. She plays Becky Fuller the new producer of the lowest-rated network morning show Daybreak. (The network is called IBS but the studio is supposedly in the same building in which CBSs The Early Show shoots next to F.A.O. Schwartz and the Apple Store.) Instead of serving a wicked queen as in Prada our heroine must soothe and inspire a fallen king whom she needs to save her show and career. Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) is the Dan Rather-like eminence grise whom the network has fired but who still has time left on his contract. Thats the high concept What if Rather -- with his outsize ego and serious-newsman pretensions -- were forced to co-host (with Diane Keatons Colleen Peck) a chirpy 7 to 9 a.m. show featuring lifestyle celebs and cooking demonstrations? Wouldnt you hate to be his producer? Its a fine premise and Ford taps into his apparently bottomless well of bile to take Pomeroy out of the lovable curmudgeon category and make him truly unpleasant. Hes clenched tight-faced his voice so gruff that its a wonder he has the moisture to keep his vocal cords lubricated; his inner world is cacti and barbed wire. Ford is very funny but its a one-joke character. He needs another sparring partner. There happens to be one handy Diane Keaton maybe the most gifted comic actress of her generation is smartly dressed and coiffed and ready to fly. But the movie barely uses her. Keaton looms large on the posters and is all over the promos but this is one step away from being a bit part -- her scenes end before they get going. All fake cheerfulness on-camera Colleen breaks character and complains when the show goes to a commercial -- but then with little transition shes suddenly pitching in and clowning around. In montages. Then its back to McAdams doing her Mary Tyler Moore-by-way-of-the-Disney Channel shtick and Ford staring daggers at her. Brit director Roger Michell is better known for movies of high seriousness with writers like Hanif Kureshi (The Buddha of Suburbia) and Ian McEwan (Enduring Love) and it wouldnt surprise me if he over-identified with Mike Pomeroy. His work is brisk and businesslike less obvious than David Frankels in Prada but nowhere near as warm and affectionate. Neither he nor Aileen Brosh McKenna thinks enough of the audience to develop or even sustain their ideas. At one point it looks as if the answer to the shows rating woes is to exploit Pomeroys disdain for the morning-show genre to make ratings hay out of his prickliness. But then the idea is dropped -- it goes nowhere. It turns out that Pomeroys idea of hard news -- the linchpin of his argument that there is a place for reporting and analysis even on Daybreak -- is confronting the governor of the state at home when hes about to be arrested in a hooker-and-corruption scandal. Thats some idea of seriousness Dan Rather turns out to be Geraldo Rivera. Morning Glory is full of gaps and off notes from major (Beckys elided relationship with Patrick Wilsons hard-news rich-boy dreamboat) to minor but niggling (the live feed from an amusement park thats fully operational at 8 a.m.). When NBC wants to interview Becky -- now a star for turning around Daybreak -- for a job at the Today show they call her IBS boss (Jeff Goldblum who gives believe it or not the least dithery performance). Then the NBC bigwigs meet with her at 820 a.m. while her own show is on the air -- in front of a TV monitor so she can be distracted by her dysfunctional-but-lovable surrogate family. Morning Glory isnt terrible. It has a lot of craft a lot of star power and a fair number of laughs. What irks me is that the filmmakers settle for so little. They poke fun at Daybreak at the whole artificial shallow self-satisfied genre of TV morning shows yet they approach their own genre -- the comic chick flick -- with no more inspiration than the people who make those shows. They follow the formula no matter how insipid and predictable because they know their core audience wont have anything else to do and its better if theyre only half awake.

Which is better? The first kind gets you Academy Award nominations; the second maybe a star career. With her performance as Becky Potter the network TV producer in the new workplace comedy Morning Glory Rachel McAdams just landed in Column B. For most of the past decade McAdams 32 has been an attractive movie ornament supporting roles in Mean Girls Wedding Crashers State of Play Sherlock Holmes leads in the popular mystico-weepies The Notebook and The Time Travelers Wife. If she may never graduate to the super-serious category of Oscar bait its because her persona is free of neurosis; with the least provocation her face can detonate into a dimple festival; critics writing about McAdams find their fingers irresistibly typing the word ""perky."" She infuses her monologues with a musical fervor as if she were channeling Julie Andrews. (In Morning Glory more than one person interrupts her mid-speech to ask her ""Are you gonna sing?"") Im saying her Adorability Quotient is off the charts. If being ingratiating is a crime shed be shot at sunrise. But this good nature doesnt seem forced; her gifts as an actress complement her appeal as an all-American (actually all-Canadian) girl. The character of Becky is an ideal fit for these qualities and good thing too since McAdams has to carry the film nearly solo. (See TIMEs review of The Time Travelers Wife.) Morning Glory is a cut above most other recent light fare but not a prime cut. The director Roger Michell has made a couple of excellent indie films (Persuasion The Mother) and two charmingly soft-centered comedies about improbable friendships (Notting Hill Venus) but this time his work is confined to guiding McAdams finely calibrated performance and the broader work of her colleagues. The writer Aline Brosh McKenna previously confected the dismal romantic comedies 27 Dresses and Laws of Attraction plus the OK adaptation of The Devil Wears Prada. This might be her solidest job if only because shes borrowing from two towering James L. Brooks projects about women who produce news shows the wonderful workplace sitcom Mary Tyler Moore and the 1987 film Broadcast News. A pale genial knockoff of the two McKennas script posits Becky as having the sunniness of the Moore character and the drive of Holly Hunter in Broadcast News. (See the top 10 things todays kids will never experience.) Since she was a kid watching Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel Becky has wanted to produce the Today Show. Shes on that road as the film begins supervising a local talk-fest called Good Morning New Jersey. Abruptly dismissed from that gig shes hired at a lower salary (impossible) to run a national show IBCs Daybreak whose ratings are mired below Today ABCs Good Morning America and even ""that thing on CBS."" No question Daybreak is in trouble. No stars will come on the show. The weatherman is a sad goof the lifestyle specialist is functionally illiterate. The passable female host Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) is saddled with a sex addict for a desk partner (Modern Familys Ty Burrell); he likes websites devoted to sexy feet and half-clad grannies. The shows viewership isnt much to brag about either. ""Half the people watching have lost their remote"" IBCs news boss (Jeff Goldblum) tells Becky. ""The other half are waiting for their nurses to turn them over."" If Daybreaks audience is in its dotage then Becky after she fires the perv has the perfect replacement Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) who matches Colette in advanced years but lacks her telegenic temperament. A hardened hard-news veteran he boasts that in his long career hes survived both Bosnian shrapnel and lunch with Dick Cheney. What he refuses to do is the fluffy banter mandatory for A.M. fare. Mostly he grouses and glowers at the indignity of it all; think CBSs Bob Simon but with a sociopaths edge. Bizarrely Becky never urges Mike to use his lifetime of contacts to corral important guests; nor does she order him to change the ludicrous striped socks he flashes each morning. When Becky visits Mikes apartment the night before the first show she finds out hes an accomplished chef but doesnt ask him to cook up something on camera. Thats a strand the movie takes another full hour yanking into the plot -- while Becky concentrates on saving the show and realizing her dream. (Watch TIMEs 10 questions for Harrison Ford.) Ages ago in the 1930s and 40s romantic comedies proposed a battle of equals the woman was likely to be at least as smart successful resourceful and resilient as the man. ( The Lady Eve I rest my case.) Now that women have nearly achieved parity in the workplace theyve lost it at the movies; the rom-com has misplaced its edge along with most of its wit. Unlike other entries in this damaged genre -- every picture with Katherine Heigl and most of those starring Sandra Bullock Amy Adams Kate Hudson Anne Hathaway you name her -- Morning Glory stops short of saying that its main character is a loser because shes in love with her career and not at the moment marriage. Indeed Beckys designated romance with a guy (Patrick Wilson) in the networks real news division serves a perfunctory subplot subordinate to her determination to get a good job and do a great one. Watch Becky in her first-day brainstorm session with the staff. Shes bombarded with a dozen simultaneous suggestions that no mortal could filter let alone rule on. Yet Becky does spitting out a sensible answer for each idea. Turns out shes the perfect boss efficient uncowable decisive friendly. If Morning Glory is nothing special it does manage something rare in movies to capture the pressure-cooker energy of office life. When Becky aced her first challenge at the staff meeting a couple of people in my audience applauded her achievement as if shed just flattened the villain or won the big game. (William Hurt to Holly Hunter in Broadcast News after they team successfully on a spot news report ""That was like great sex"") Heres a woman for whom fulfillment is defined by her success at work. (Plus she gets the guy.) Is that so bad? Morning Glory says it doesnt make her a freak; it makes her a heroine. Smitten moviegoers may have the same response to McAdamss Becky as they did to Emma Stones Olive in the recent Easy A. Both are bright sensible young women who think they cant attract a guy -- except for every male in the audience. Im tempted to go further and compare McAdams performance in its effortless seductiveness against all odds to Katharine Hepburns star-making turn in a 1933 comedy about a beguiling young actress. Actually Hepburn won her first Oscar for that movie. It was called Morning Glory. See Katharine Hepburn in TIMEs gallery of Hollywood covers. See the 100 best movies of all time.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 10 2010 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Diane Keaton left and Harrison Ford are shown in a scene from "" Morning Glory."" Macall Polay/Paramount Pictures/AP           View Caption About video ads View Caption of Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) is a plucky newly hired workaholic producer for ""Daybreak"" the lowest-rated national morning TV show. The show is so bad that its a punch line in TV land - a sick joke. ""Morning Glory"" is about how Rachel pulls the show out of the basement by you guessed it dumbing it down ever further into imbecility. This might be an acceptable premise for a comedy except for one thing The filmmakers endorse the imbecility. ""Morning Glory"" is a tribute to low standards and high ratings - just the sort of thing Hollywood can get firmly behind.I realize this movie is essentially cotton candy but it has an acrid aftertaste. Becky a human whirligig epoxied to her BlackBerry is portrayed as a vivacious sprite. Her anything-for-ratings ambition is supposed to be well cute. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Her big move comes when she pairs the morning shows longtime long-suffering host Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) with curmudgeonly blowhard Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) the networks resident hard-news legend who has been sitting out his contract after being shifted out of his evening anchor spot. These cohosts despise each other. While Colleen is willing to don a fat suit and tussle on air with a sumo wrestler the grave-faced Mike who has won every journalism award known to man wont even do one of those obligatory cooking-class segments. (He wont even utter the word ""fluffy."") Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Instead of standing up for the type of journalism that Mike represents director Roger Michell and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (""The Devil Wears Prada"") denigrate him as a scowly relic from a distant era. The films payoff arrives on cue when grudgingly inevitably he comes around.Keaton at least looks as if shes having fun as the alternately daffy and hard-edged former Miss Arizona whos seen it all. Ford however keeps himself in a constant state of humorless high dudgeon and his Scrooge routine gets very old very fast. He acts like someone who never told a joke - or heard one.""Broadcast News"" of course is the template for this movie but a bit of ""Network"" might have been welcome too. The dismal dumbing-down that Paddy Chayefskys ""Network"" predicted for the future of TV has been more than fulfilled but whereas Chayefsky was mad as hell about it the folks behind ""Morning Glory"" are just fine with it.Is it fair to judge a dippy romantic comedy by its ideas - or lack of them? I think it is if as is the case here the ideas such as they are are central to the comedy. ""Morning Glory"" isnt targeting the dumbing down of TV news. Its pandering to the audience that craves the dumbness. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for some sexual content including dialogue language and brief drug references.)

Photo Credit Macall Polay Photo/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Eager-beaver TV producer tries to turn around a failing morning show dragging well-paid on-air ""talent"" behind her. BOTTOM LINE The magnetic McAdams redeems much of this inept comedy. CAST Rachel McAdams Harrison Ford Diane Keaton Patrick Wilson LENGTH 142 Shes never been arrested never gone to rehab and obviously never tried to conceal a firearm outside of ""Sherlock Holmes."" But Rachel McAdams is a movie star nonetheless and ""Morning Glory"" is proof positive When the Canadian-born redhead appears - as she has in ""The Notebook"" and ""The Time-Travelers Wife"" - shes all you see. And its a very good thing for this generally woeful comedy which delivers only inadvertently a dark commentary on the state of the young and unemployed. If director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") had tossed out the emo songs and used the music from say ""Psycho"" McAdams frenetic Becky Fuller might have come across as a nascent serial killer. Her obsession with work - shes the producer of the early a.m. ""Good Morning New Jersey"" until shes fired - is funny sort of but also disturbingly desperate. She has no life outside work; shes defined by her job; her neediness borders on the pathological. advertisement | advertise on newsday Whatever drives her - and fear of unemployment is certainly a factor - her own mother (Patti DArbanville) calls it ""embarrassing."" That painful scene echoes through the film. Becky finds a job of course - the low-paying unrewarding job of turning a fourth-ranked network morning show called ""Daybreak"" into a success. The network is financially crippled by its richly compensated but profoundly unproductive senior citizens. Most notable among them the embittered ex-anchor Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) a combination of Dan Rather and Ted Baxter. Beckys brainstorm Mike in the morning. Contractually he cant say no. But he can make her life miserable. VideoTrailer Morning Glory with Rachel McAdams McAdams energy (and yes her looks) keep Michells movie rolling through inexplicable behavior bad wardrobe the waste of Diane Keaton as Mikes on-air antagonist and the incessant music that serves as sloppily applied mortar between lumpy narrative stones. advertisement | advertise on newsday Oh and its confused message Beckys solution is turning ""Daybreak"" into the cheesiest of newspop. This is apparently a good thing. The argument between entertainment and news she tells Mike the hard-news dinosaur has been going on forever and ""your side lost"" So has the argument that Hollywood can make a coherent comedy if ""Morning Glory"" is any indication Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Morning Glory | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; morning-glory ) Morning Glory (United States 2010) November 10 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Like the occasionally dark Broadcast News and the considerably bleaker Network Morning Glory takes a peek behind the curtain of television newscasts and reveals that all is not as clean and ordered as it appears over-the-air. The film is at its best when it is at its most goofy at times coming close to the laugh-aloud outrageousness of Will Ferrells Anchorman. The central character a cartoonishly cheerful career-minded woman by the name of Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) is endearing enough to make viewers forgive the half-hearted clichA(c)d ventures into her sit-com inspired life. Morning Glory succeeds when it captures the antics rivalries and petty acts of rebellion unseen by the cameras. Becky is on a fast track to the top as a producer for a New Jersey morning TV show. Called into her boss office with the expectation of a promotion she instead learns shes being fired. His calling her ""the best producer Ive had to fire"" is scant comfort. She sends out resumes everywhere without a bite until Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum) an executive for a fictitious ""fourth network"" (not ABC NBC or CBS) comes calling. His morning show Daybreak is on life support and hes looking for an unconventional executive producer to shake things up. Despite her youth and inexperience - or perhaps because of it - Becky is his choice. She gets off to an unpromising start failing to hit it off with Daybreaks popular female anchor Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) and generating a palpable sense of animosity when she pegs out-to-pasture serious newsman Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to provide the testosterone balance to Colleens estrogen. Ratings take a nosedive and Becky learns she has six weeks to perform a miracle or face cancellation. So she pulls out the stops and thats when Morning Glory starts to become fun. Becky isnt hard to like but thats almost entirely as a result of the effervescence evident in Rachel McAdams performance not because the characters back story which is a minefield of familiar sit-com situations has any resonance. In fact Morning Glory is at its worst when it follows Becky away from the studio. Her romance with evening news producer Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson) is dull and lifeless. Poor Patrick Wilson serves no higher purpose than providing a good-looking love interest; the term ""underused"" doesnt do justice for this sort of role. Jeff Goldblum makes a lot more out of an even less meaty appearance. Then again Goldblum can arrest attention by merely standing around in the background. Meanwhile Harrison Ford recycles his performance from the Sabrina remake right down to the predictable arc in which the icy sheath encasing his heart melts. Ford it must be admitted does pomposity exceedingly well. Diane Keaton is so good at her part that one can see her sliding effortlessly into an anchors chair on a real morning show. (That would be a clever way to promote the movie.) Nevertheless despite the conventional manner in which the story is resolved Morning Glory generates enough entertainment good will and genuine laughs to make it hard to dislike. Beckys enthusiasm is at times infectious and its fun to watch the things she does to give some life to her dying show. Would that any actual morning program would be this spontaneous and lively... Despite maintaining its jovial tone Morning Glory makes a serious point although it does so with a lightness of touch that makes one wonder whether its present as an afterthought. Like the aforementioned Network this production wonders aloud about where television news is going and whether theres any place for hard news in a medium where reality shows and live-action tabloids rule. Ultimately Morning Glory sidesteps the issue perhaps recognizing that an honest answer to the question might kill any meager box office potential the movie has. Better not to dis a key demographic. Finding a release date for Morning Glory created problems for Paramount. Its not the kind of high-minded production that appeals to Oscar nominators nor does it have the sound and fury necessary to capture a teen crowd trolling for action. And although it contains a lukewarm romance the fitful chemistry between McAdams and Patrick Wilson doesnt tip this into romantic comedy territory. Morning Glory fits into a shrinking category the old-fashioned not-too-raunchy character-based comedy. Its gentle unforced and despite its flaws likeable. It doesnt blaze new trails or astound with its wit but more likely than not youll leave the theater with a smile and thats certainly worth a recommendation.

""Your side lost"" a young hotshot TV producer (Rachel McAdams) informs a grumpy veteran anchor (Harrison Ford) forced to trade in serious journalism for the info-tainment he despises in Roger Michells entertaining ""Morning Glory."" It may lack the edge of ""Broadcast News"" but this unofficial update on the news-vs.-fluff wars does get in some good shots at the wacky world of morning television (admittedly an easy target). It includes more than a few clever lines and boasts a stellar cast including the underutilized Diane Keaton. PHOTOS MORNING GLORY FILMING IN NEW YORK McAdams who has hovered on the edge of stardom since ""Mean Girls"" six years ago may have finally found the right vehicle in this script by Aline Brosh McKenna who bounces back from the reprehensible ""27 Dresses"" with this variation on her more famous ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Its also more than a little reminiscent of ""Working Girl"" and of course ""Broadcast News."" The actress is delightful as Becky a 28-year-old junior producer downsized by a local station in New Jersey. Her chutzpah impresses an executive (Jeff Goldblum) at the fictional IBS network whos desperate for the latest victim to run his morning show a longtime embarrassment and ratings also-ran (think CBSs ""The Early Show""). Becky may be a klutz -- McAdams has a gift for physical comedy -- but shes also some kind of genius. After firing the shows obnoxious male anchor she discovers a loophole that gets her the services of Mike (Ford) a highly respected but grumpy pompous Dan Rather-esque 40-year veteran of the network. Mike is outraged at the idea of doing celebrity interviews (50 Cent among others has a cameo) and especially working with the longtime co-anchor Colleen (Keaton) a long-ago beauty-contest winner he considers an airhead. But he wants to continue collecting his lavish salary. Becky gooses the anemic ratings with stunts -- Colleen sumo-wrestles and kisses a frog while the weatherman (Matt Malloy) goes skydiving. What moves the needle most is when Mike who has resisted all of Beckys efforts to lighten up finally launches into an on-air fight with Colleen. ""Morning Glory"" could use more scenes like this one. Perhaps theyll be on the DVD -- cut to make room for an insipid romantic subplot involving Becky and another producer (Patrick Wilson) in a movie thats still overlong. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Rachel Bilson and Hayden Christensen dating again after br...

(Paramount) Joe Neumaier Wednesday November 10 2010 400 AM Title Morning Glory A young TV news producer takes on a failing show and warring co-anchors. With Rachel McAdams Harrison Ford Diane Keaton. Director Roger Michell. (142) PG-13 Language sexuality. At area theaters.Theres so much manic mainstream energy in ""Morning Glory"" that audiences immune to its brand of workplace comedy may respond the way Harrison Fords crotchety anchorman does when he witnesses a TV weather-clowns shenanigans His face still as a stone he droops one eyelid pursing his lips in irritation.The movie hits so many stock sitcom beats that the reaction is understandable. But this often-witty baby-of-""Broadcast News"" tries hard to be liked like the TV fluff its built around. The news is that often it succeeds.Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) is a newly-fired New Jersey morning-show producer re-evaluating her career when she gets a call from a network bigwig (Jeff Goldblum in a supporting turn so perfect he floats). Becky talks her way into an executive producers gig on the last-place ""Daybreak"" program where her first move is to pair the a.m. doyenne Colleen Peck (a silvery slick Diane Keaton) with Mike Pomeroy (Ford) a tough Mike Wallace-like reporting legend on the verge of retirement.The match-up of course isnt welcomed by anyone and Pomeroy who Becky nabbed by pointing out a contract loophole does all he can to undermine the young go-getters plans. When the show gets more eyeballs by resorting to outrageous on-air stunts Becky is given a time limit to make it shine.The set-up places Becky between Pomeroy and Pecks differing approaches but screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna gets distracted by more interesting ideas about entertainment vs. news. Since Becky is thinly drawn -- she tells us she bungles and rambles but we only see her being hyper-efficient -- we cant exactly sympathize with her.Still director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") manages to bump the story segments together smoothly including the chick-flick throwaway bits like Beckys romance with a handsome network coworker (Patrick Wilson).McAdams ever charming plays it endearingly with a smile wide enough to span the Hudson and a spunky Everygirl energy. Shes a fun counterbalance to Ford who succeeds by growling scowling and being Harrison Ford-like. The irony is that while Pomeroy is a pill Ford is the most casual hes been since ""Working Girl."" When he and McAdams spar you cant help but tune in.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 10 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Morning Glory is a working-girl comedy one of those cheerful movies in which the plucky heroine lands a man as she conquers her career. Its part of a grand Hollywood tradition that goes back at least as far as 1940 when Rosalind Russell played a scoop-hungry journalist in His Girl Friday. In the 1980s Melanie Griffith took the role into the post-feminist era playing a secretary masquerading as her female boss in a film actually entitled Working Girl. More recently Meryl Streep took over the part of the wicked she-boss in The Devil Wears Prada playing a controlling magazine editor to Anne Hathaways put-upon assistant. Movies Morning Glory The official trailer Now Rachel McAdams plays an ambitious young TV producer trying to convince a grumpy old Emmy-winning news correspondent (Harrison Ford) to reinvent himself as a chipper morning-show host. And at this point the working girls family tree gets tangled in a spot of incestuous procreation. Morning Glory was written by Aline Brosh McKenna the screenwriter who adapted The Devil Wears Prada from a novel and its tempting to stack the two movies beside each other and pronounce Morning Glory a paler imitation. Naive journalism intern is blocked by egotistical magazine editor; keener TV producer is blocked by embittered correspondent. All I have to do is tell you that Harrison Ford is no Meryl Streep and we are out of here. Tempting but not entirely fair. Ford is rapidly moving into the grouchy old man demographic but he really outshines himself as veteran broadcast journalist Mike Pomeroy with a grumpiness so life-sucking it proves paradoxically riveting. While he does deadpan Diane Keaton takes the more obvious route as his co-anchor Colleen all smiles on screen all snarls off hamming up her part with aplomb. Meanwhile the winsome McAdams proves a worthy heir of the screwball-comedy queens. Plus the movie does show some welcome wit as it satirizes the idiocies of morning TV - until it starts repeating itself in the second half. Workaholic morning show producer Becky Fuller figures shes made it to the big time when she is hired to run Daybreak by a network in New York. Except that Daybreak is number-four in the ratings and is co-hosted by a foot fetishist. Becky promptly fires him and cleverly figures out that Pomeroy recently dismissed from the evening news due to excessive gravitas and now busy duck-shooting in the country has months to run on his multi-million-dollar contract. She makes him an offer he cannot legally refuse. But he doesnt play ball refusing to do the cooking segments or say the word fluffy on air annoying co-host Colleen. The already appalling ratings plummet and the big guy upstairs a delightfully distracted Jeff Goldblum tells Becky the show has only six weeks to live. What follows is a tale of mutual seduction as an obstructionist Mike and a determined Becky set out to save Daybreak with a coincidental combination of outrageous stunts and good journalism. Oh the romantically challenged Becky is also engaged in mutual seduction with the handsome producer of a magazine show (Patrick Wilson) but thats almost a footnote. When she describes having sex with this ""smokin guy"" in the presence of an open mike both the boyfriend himself and director Roger Michell just melt into the background. Michell once made an entire movie of such humiliation when he directed Notting Hill so he knows there is no need to track it here. Thats smart. And when the boyfriend phones Becky in the middle of her coveted job interview with The Today Show to point out that Mike is on air doing a cooking segment for her and utters the words ""He is not going to ask you twice"" you have to acknowledge some clever writing. On the other hand when poor Ford has to deliver a work-life balance speech to Becky (and thus save her actual romance) without sounding sentimental you have to cringe at both writing and direction. Unfortunately Fords work becomes less interesting to watch as Mike becomes less grumpy. And when Michell shoots an extended sequence of Becky running in a fluffy dress across Rockefeller Plaza against a soaring soundtrack you know you are in a movie that is simply marking time until its obvious denouement. Yes its The Devil Wears Prada redux.

"Morning Glory (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Morning Glory (PG-13) Harrison Ford needs to lighten up. Seriously. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/9/2010 Editor rating 2 Someone apparently forgot to tell Harrison Ford he was starring in a comedy when he was cast in Morning Glory. As Mike Pomeroy a legendary TV newsman and cantankerous crab who hates being told what to do Ford doesnt give the character any humor or shading of humanity. He plays him straight like a misanthropic Dan Rather so he barely gets any laughs (imagine what Jack Nicholson or Harvey Keitel would have done with this part). Ford was funnier in Extraordinary Measures than he is here and that was a movie about terminally ill children. Fortunately Morning Glory isnt really about him This is the story of Becky (Rachel McAdams) a plucky TV news producer (is there ever any other kind in movies?) who gets her big break when shes handed the reins of a flailing network morning show and assigned to boost its ratings. Becky gets the idea to pair Pomeroy who is under contract with the network and cant say no with the chirpy co-host Colleen (Diane Keaton). The two anchors immediately loathe each other He cant stand her ""soft"" stories about trendy recipes and cute animals; she hates his gruff demeanor and condescending manner. But after a rocky start - and in the films funniest montage some daring new ideas from Becky involving the shows weatherman - the ratings begin to pick up. Morning Glory which was directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill) from a script by Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada) isnt really interested in the inner workings of the television news industry the way Broadcast News was. This is a softer more generic picture about a young woman rising to the challenge placed before her with some time made along the way for an utterly superfluous completely unnecessary romantic subplot (with Patrick Wilson) to prove that shes not a) asexual or b) a lesbian. McAdams remains the most talented and promising of the current crop of inheritors to the Julia Roberts crown (watch the underrated Red Eye for proof of how good she can be). But even she isnt enough to save this mild bland picture for sinking into a swamp of blahs. The only thing that could have really kickstarted Morning Glory which even wastes Keatons comedic talents was a home run from Ford. This was a perfect opportunity for him to loosen up and have some much needed fun but the actor seems to have grown listless and more reticent to emote with age. Like Pomeroy he simply cant be bothered. Theres no Han Solo left in him; theres just grumpy old man. Cast Rachel McAdams Harrison Ford Diane Keaton Patrick Wilson Jeff Goldblum John Pankow.

"All the news thats fit to wince | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAll the news thats fit to winceHarrison Ford Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams serve mostly decaffeinated yuks in the fitfully funny satire Morning Glory.Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford in Morning Glory.  (MACALL POLAY / PARAMOUNT PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Nov. 9 2010Morning Glory (out of 4)Starring Harrison Ford Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Roger Michell. At theatres throughout the GTA. 110 minutes.It doesnt pay to have a good memory or high standards when appraising Morning Glory a fitfully amusing broadcast satire that unfortunately invites comparisons to sharper times and pens.Youll think of Broadcast News and Network watching it and possibly lament how the film ducks the tough issues of media accountability and culpability that those films dealt with decades ago.Article Continued BelowYoull also likely recall The Mary Tyler Moore Show a groundbreaking 1970s TV comedy with razor laughs Morning Glory can only approximate -- although Rachel McAdams would make an excellent Mary Richards Harrison Ford a decent Lou Grant and Diane Keaton an intriguing hybrid of Ted Baxter and Sue Ann Nivens. Director Roger Michell (Notting Hill) and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada) have the comic tension (hard news vs. soft fluff) and they have the cast.What they lack is any sense of purpose. Are they trying to say anything meaningful about television and the media? If so theyve failed.Are they content to just amuse viewers with sitcom-level yuks? If so they succeed only moderately.Their dilemma is not unlike that of McAdams Becky Fuller a 28-year-old workaholic with a jumbo coffee in one hand and a BlackBerry in the other. Unceremoniously dumped from her producer job at a New Jersey morning show -- shes replaced by a younger and more driven male -- she lands at a gig at a failing New York morning program called Daybreak carried by the fictional IBS network. The man who hires her played with insouciant smarm by Jeff Goldblum (this years funniest third banana) acts as if hes handing her the keys to a rusted Edsel. She has little time and less money to get the heap moving until the network permanently parks it. Should Becky go soft or hard in her approach? With nothing to lose but her job (again) she tries both. She cajoles the crabby Daybreak anchor Colleen Peck (Keaton) into doing more human interest stories like kissing frogs and dancing with rappers (the real 50 Cent obliges).Becky bullies shelved IBS star journalist Mike Pomeroy (Ford) into being co-anchor to Peck with the idea that hell deliver the days top scoops while also occasionally kissing amphibians and hoe-downing with hip-hoppers.Interesting concept except Pomeroy is having none of it. Channelling a cross between Dan Rather and Foghorn Leghorn Pomeroy pompously informs everyone within earshot that journalism has gone all to hell and hes not going to assist with the burial. He cant forget the good ol days when TV newsmen did important and dangerous things ""I pulled Colin Powell from a burning jeep . . . I had lunch with Dick Cheney""We can sympathize with Pomeroys frustrations even if he really is an obnoxious windbag. And you have to wonder if Fords constant grimacing isnt partly due to the dull script and lacklustre direction hes dealing with.Morning Glory has a few zingers none of them lethal. A joke about Pomeroy being ""the third-worst person in the world"" is tediously set up and then delivered with a resounding thud. The annoying soundtrack consists of achingly on-the-nose pop tunes that have been chosen to mirror exactly what the characters are doing.And what would Networks Paddy Chayefsky have made of a plot that revolves around a characters ability to make life-affirming frittatas? At least the romance doesnt encourage the eyes to roll. Ford is 68 and Adams is 31 and thankfully no attempt is made to bridge that gap. (Instead Adams is paired with Patrick Wilson a good actor given the thankless job of being the films passionless straight man.)The Ford/McAdams matchup does give Morning Glory the caffeine jolt it so badly requires but its largely due to the acting gifts of McAdams who elevates every movie shes in. You have to wonder though how this picture might have played if more attention had been paid to the tensions between Keaton and Ford which the trailer sells but the movie doesnt really deliver. It would be a whole other movie one that the director and screenwriter still probably wouldnt understand.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Rachel McAdams watches the magic happen in Morning Glory (Macall Polay) B- Morning Glory Starring Harrison Ford Diane Keaton Rachel McAdams; Starring Jeff Goldblum; Author Aline Brosh McKenna; Release Date Wide 11/10/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted November 12 2010 -- 1200 AM EST The end of the year tends to bring about the release of a new James L. Brooks movie or more often than not an imitation James L. Brooks movie -- usually directed by Nancy Meyers who I would say now makes them better than Brooks does. Morning Glory might be described as a fake imitation James L. Brooks movie. Its trying for the same mixture of romance and repartee and social observation but its pretty light on all three. Directed by Roger Michell (Notting Hill) from a script by Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada) the movie would like to be the Broadcast News of happy-talk morning shows but it isnt just the setting thats sillier and more superficial; the whole film is really just a chintzy work-family sitcom. Yet I suspect that Morning Glory will find an audience if only because as mediocre as the picture often is it features the sort of tasty ham-on-cheese movie-star overacting thats undeniable lowbrow fun. You know a movie isnt aiming high when it serves up the clash of values between sturdy responsible old-school news reporting and dumbed-down coffee-time froth -- and the movie favors the froth. Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) is an aspiring TV producer who loses her job at a New Jersey station and then through a blend of desperation and overactive charm talks her way into a position as executive producer of Daybreak a notoriously bad fourth-ranked morning show on which the coanchors have been grinning at each other for so long that their teeth look ready to fall out. McAdams all googly doe eyes and nervous dimpled grins infuses this go-getter with enough schoolgirl vivacity enough spunk to terrify Mary Tyler Moore. Shes perfectly appealing provided you dont mind that she plays every scene on the exact same level of perky eager-to-please caffeinated energy. Her opposite number is Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) a bombastic nightly-news legend whos been put out to pasture by IBS the same network that produces Daybreak. Unluckily for him hes idolized by Becky who forces him to finish out his contract by recruiting him as the shows new cohost. Hes supposed to sit beside Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) the longtime chatty diva of a coanchor and engage her in smiley chitchat between kitschy-koo segments about kittens and meatball recipes. But Mike a beady-eyed stentorian grouch who is terminally serious about TV news and his own fame and importance is so wrong for the role that he wont stoop to smile let alone banter. Some actors get mellower as they get older. Harrison Ford has gotten slower -- a lot slower -- and angrier too. In his movies he now ""converses"" in a voice thats halfway between a growl and a mumble. Its as though he were reading every line off a rusty TelePrompTer in his brain. At 68 however Ford is still a magnetic hunk of gray-granite movie star and in Morning Glory he finds a way to trick up his deadly somber shifting-quicksand delivery into a shrewd and amusing acting style. As Mike hes an outrageously stone-faced comedian who basically plays a surlier Lou Grant to McAdams MTM-ish Becky. We expect that Mike with his furrowed handsome frown his utter lack of humor and his perpetual you-want-me-to-do-WHAT? attitude will thaw as the movie goes on but Ford never wavers. For just about all of Morning Glory he plays Mike with a sullen rasp and a lugubrious hostility that make him seem like Clint Eastwood with a touch of Bela Lugosi. Forget that Mike doesnt want to be on the show; Ford looks like he barely wants to be in the movie. And thats why hes easily the best thing in it. Morning Glory when its not stuck in boringly generic romantic scenes with McAdams and Patrick Wilson is of course about how Becky turns Daybreak into a huge success -- not by improving its quality but by filling it with shameless pandering stunts. Where Broadcast News mourned the trivialization of the nightly news Morning Glory asks you to learn to stop worrying and love the trivia. Thats the big lesson Mike has to learn; its a lesson the movie peddles to its audience as well. I wasnt buying it not for a moment. But at least its a lesson that Harrison Ford acts out through clenched teeth.

Rachel McAdams appears in a scene in ""Morning Glory."" Photo Macall Polay Paramount Pictures Morning Glory review charm but weak characters 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Morning Glory Comedy. Starring Rachel McAdams Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton. Directed by Roger Michell. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Morning Glory"" is as fresh as new laundry or Rachel McAdams but theres something wrong with it too and whats wrong is in the performances. Roger Michell directs it as though it were an uproarious comedy but the laughs are light and the storys real appeal lies in its behind-the-scenes look at the manners and politics of morning television. Its a portrait of a young woman and her world but both are undercut by one-note heavy-handed comic acting. Its odd. Michell directed ""Notting Hill"" which was a delight and ""Changing Lanes"" (with Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck) one of the most underrated films of the last decade. He knows how to control tone and he knows actors. Yet he either allowed or encouraged Harrison Ford to act as though mumbling through a coma. And he either allowed or encouraged McAdams in the opposite extreme to play virtually every scene bouncing off walls and talking nonstop. This is too bad because theres more than a kernel of truth to what McAdams does here even if its obscured by mannerism and overplaying. McAdams as Becky is an ambitious career monster but in the nicest way - there are such people likable and engaging and basically nice but so focused on external achievement that the rest of life has no meaning for her. McAdams has fire in her eyes. She makes Beckys ambition intelligence and drive easy to believe. Likewise her ruthlessness. A low-level TV operative who becomes the executive producer of a struggling morning show young Becky turns around and fires a worthless anchorman 20 minutes into her first day on the job. We look at McAdams and know Yes she would do that. But the motor-mouthed stuff the super-energized playing the constant nervous energy - that seems more like an actress first draft at a character or some nutty attempt to be likable or some strenuous response to the pressures of comedy. Whatever it was Michell should have rescued her. That this problem in ""Morning Glory"" is systemic is apparent from an early scene in which Becky meets the shows longtime anchorwoman (Diane Keaton). Keaton flails and rails trying to drive home nonexistent laughs. But ultimately Keaton takes control of her performance holds back and locates her character in quieter and more real place. Keaton is important in ""Morning Glory"" - shes the one principal player who completely knows what shes doing. The movies big relationship is between McAdams and Ford who plays a former network anchor forced to do the morning show because of a clause in his contract. And so he does it talking in a monotone and never taking the scowl off his face. The anchorman wears the same scowl off camera as well. Perhaps Ford should be congratulated for finally achieving something he has been working toward for years - a performance in which he doesnt smile once. So McAdams plays her role as though shes drunk two pots of coffee and Ford plays it as though hes consumed 8 pints of embalming fluid. Consequently it becomes a matter of indifference whether their characters ever reach an understanding. At least McAdams is giving not just the actress but the character she plays. Ford is just a slab like something that could fall face first out of a closet. George Romero wouldnt allow his zombies to act this dead. And yet ... the whole atmosphere of ""Morning Glory"" is rather pleasant. Its interesting to lurk behind the scenes of a morning show to get an idea (albeit an exaggerated one) of what an executive producer does and how segments come about; to see the jockeying for interviews and the planning of stories and the glamour and the harshness of working in that environment. ""Morning Glory"" isnt ""Broadcast News."" It never could have been ""Broadcast News"" though well never know how close it could have come. But there are worse things than to linger in this world. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations. Also Harrison Ford may spook some children at least ones who havent seen ""Dawn of the Dead.""

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Morning Glory"" is full of beans and I mean that in the best possible way. Its perky its peppy it tootles along with a grinning gaiety not many movies can manage. The film honors the conventions of workplace comedy without allowing them to sag into cliche. It showcases rising star Rachel McAdams in a career-making performance and flanks her with old pros Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton at the top of their form. Its got a snappy pace glamorous Manhattan locations and a gaggle of great characters in roles major and small. Its formula entertainment admittedly but theres real pleasure in seeing the equation worked out so cleverly. McAdams plays Becky a plucky idealistic highly caffeinated minor-league TV producer hired to save ""Daybreak"" a floundering national morning news show. Well to slow its death spiral would be more accurate. Pessimistic programming chief Jeff Goldblum asks only that she let the show expire quietly; his apathetic last-place network cant keep the newsroom door handles from falling off. Theres a package of game shows and syndicated fluff that would fill the time slot just fine. Becky having lucked into her dream job aims to give the show a life-saving makeover. Step one recruit legendary broadcaster Mike Pomeroy (Ford) out of semi-retirement to man the anchor desk. Unless he accepts the new assignment hell lose 6 million remaining on his contract. Fords gravitas and comedic irritability are in perfect balance here. His expression when this infant uses legal jiujitsu to force him to cohost with ""former Miss Arizona"" Colleen Peck (Keaton) is sidesplitting. As in screenwriter Aline Brosh McKennas ""The Devil Wears Prada"" the clash of wills between the newcomer and the beyond-demanding veteran drives the story. And as before a Mr. Perfect boyfriend (newsmagazine producer Patrick Wilson) provides romantic window dressing. MORNING GLORY  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some sexual content including dialog language and a brief drug reference. This time though the fearful/worshipful young newcomer is in charge and the hard-as-nails professional fights back with sulfurous sarcasm. Fords old-school newsman is a fierce and fascinating creation cranky integrity and entitled ego with a human core. His verbal duels with the overmatched but stubborn McAdams have the snap of a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn duet. Even scenes where they walk and talk side by side are slyly comic her perky shoulder-switching little prance contrasting against Fords bearlike galumph. The side trips into her love affair with Wilson where she dithers and gazes calf-eyed at him dont have the same spark. Aloof and difficult as he is Ford is much more alive. As Becky engineers a series of ratings-boosting stunts (the hapless weatherman becomes the star of ""Jackass""-style skits) ""Morning Glory"" lays out predictable lessons about the tug of war between entertainment and news. To its credit the film admits that the battle for substance was lost some time ago. Director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") moves things along so briskly that the obvious bits race by; he wrote the book on timing. Michell can take a preposterous moment (would Becky really fly out the door to deal with an emergency in her skivvies?) and transform it with snappy editing. Whenever drift sets in its Ford to the rescue alternately seething and exploding about asinine human-interest stories and vacuous cooking segments. Stomach acid has rarely been so delicious.

Morning Glory McAdams shines in Morning Glory BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Nov 9 2010 (...) AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Macall Polay Rachel McAdams is shown in a scene from ""Morning Glory."" Usually I greet a movie about a gruff old boss and a spunky young assistant the way Lou Grant greeted Mary Richards ""I hate spunk.""But Hollywood has survived for more than a century by offering the occasional bright exception to the dull rule. ""Morning Glory"" which opens Wednesday is mainstream moviemaking at its most proficient with a zippy script comfort-food casting and a breakout performance by a deserving star.The star is Rachel McAdams who is executing the difficult ""inverse Anne Hathaway"" maneuver. Hathaway was a teen star who graduated to serious roles after serving an apprenticeship in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" McAdams has been touted as a serious actress for years but is now stooping to sow popcorn in a script by the same writer as ""Prada."" Call it ""The Devil Reads a TelePrompTer."" McAdams plays Becky an aspiring TV news journalist who is hired to produce a struggling morning show in Manhattan. Her boss (Jeff Goldblum) warns her that the show and her career are both in danger of cancellation but Becky hurls herself into the task with you-go-girl gusto. Her first decision is to replace a sexist co-anchor with veteran newsman Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford).Although hes legally obliged to take the job Pomeroy refuses to exchange pleasantries with co-anchor Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) a long-ago beauty queen who specializes in fluff reporting. Pomeroy wont even say the word ""fluffy"" on air and thanks to the accumulated star power of the two actors the hostilities between the characters yields some ripe juice. The movie which is briskly directed by Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") is also reasonably accurate about the dynamics of a newsroom albeit not on the level of ""Broadcast News.""Because this is popular entertainment we have to endure a romantic subplot involving news-division dreamboat Patrick Wilson (with whom McAdams has no chemistry) and the inevitable pop-song montages of how career-girl Becky can turn the world on with a smile. Yet McAdams is handling her own career transition so nimbly were convinced shes gonna make it after all. Movie reviews Morning Glory Nov 9 2010 (...)

ABOUT THE MOVIEMorning Glory  out of fourStars Rachel McAdams Harrison Ford Diane KeatonDirector Roger MichellDistributor ParamountRating PG-13 for some sexual content including dialogue language and brief drug referencesRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesOpens Wednesday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY This just in Morning Glory cant decide whether to skewer the morning news or wallow in its pap. TRAILER Should you get up for Morning Glory? So this ill-fated comedy pollinated by Broadcast News and Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy tries to do both. Thats a shame because the script by The Devil Wears Prada screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna spreads its plot awfully thin and wastes the best performance in years by Harrison Ford. And when Glory does settle on a headline its a troubling one. Looking to buck struggling ratings the morning show Daybreak struggles against bigger names and better stories served up by Good Morning America Today and the CBS morning program (""whatever its called"" Jeff Goldblum muses). Enter Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) a go-getter executive producer forced to revitalize the limping program freighted with two ornery anchors puff queen Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) and Mike Pomeroy (Ford) a journalist drawn more to political scandal than crepe baking at the top of the hour. Given the glut of morning babble this could have been fertile ground for director Roger Michell (Notting Hill) to update BroadcastNews with new-media realities such as political blogs and the 24-hour news cycle. Or to lampoon the shrill personalities who rule the morning landscape. Instead Morning Glory endorses no candidate. It tries to force-feed a romance between McAdams and station stud Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson) and ultimately takes a strange journalistic stand. Lighten up it tells hard-news junkies. Mornings are for smiles and frittata recipes. The entertainment-vs.-news debate has been going on for years McAdams tells a resigned Ford ""and your side lost"" If the film is any indication we all did. Wheres the pompous goofiness of Daybreaks anchors a la Will Ferrells Burgundy or the hot-tempered newsroom personalities so deftly captured by Broadcast? Glory isnt silly or scathing and can play as if it doesnt want to offend a core demographic. For his part Ford is dandy as a beleaguered newsman watching his profession circle the drain. Hes an actor who has lost range over the years but his sneer and grimace work here. He manages three smiles and one laugh through the entirety of the film. But given his new boss the irritation is reasonable. Keaton too seems comfortable as the harried matron of pablum and Morning Glory finds its groove when it plays Ford off Keaton or chucks its weatherman (the plucky Steve Park) onto roller coasters or into raging seas in pursuit of the story. Neither Ford nor Keaton sound much like anchors but theyve clearly had experience with bright-eyed entertainment executives fresh off the turnip truck. Those moments though are too fleeting to keep the film afloat. For all its on-air talent and parody-rich subject matter Glorys approach is too broad and facile to save it from a brief run.

"Movie review Morning Glory - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Morning GloryRachel McAdams is up to the task even if Roger Michells romantic comedy set in the world of morning talk shows falls a bit short.November 10 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Rachel McAdams in a scene from ""Morning Glory."" (AP Photo / Paramount Pictures...)In ""Morning Glory"" Rachel McAdams gives the kind of performance we go to the movies for. The rest of the film isnt always up to her level but it does provide genial entertainment until it runs out of steam. A ""Broadcast News""-type saga of life behind the camera on a struggling national morning news show based in Manhattan ""Morning Glory"" starts beautifully and though it doesnt quite go the distance it certainly has the credentials to do so. The films script is by Aline Brosh McKenna who charted a similar young-woman-on-the-rise trajectory in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" The director is the under-appreciated Roger Michell responsible for ""Notting Hill"" ""Venus"" and the best of the Jane Austen films 1995s ""Persuasion."" And McAdams costars Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton are not in need of further introduction. Though the films advertising gives the impression that McAdams is one among equals the reality is that this is her show. An actress whos brought the great gift of coming completely alive on screen to films like ""The Notebook"" ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Time Travelers Wife"" shes never carried an entire film as completely and as easily as she does here. McAdams plays Becky Fuller a young woman of endless and effortless energy liveliness and passion. Nothing but nothing gets her down for long and her funny endearing spirit is a breath of tonic air. While go-getter characters can be an irritant if not handled properly McAdams has such a great take on Fuller that she is all but irresistible. Fullers great passion in life is being a morning news producer a job that pretty much eats her alive. She is up at 130 a.m. to get to the station for ""Good Morning New Jersey"" a situation she hopes will lead to her lifelong dream of working for ""Today."" Instead of moving up however the workaholic Fuller is fired for budgetary reasons but she then catches the eye of Jerry Barnes (a swell Jeff Goldblum) who runs a network called IBS. He is looking for an executive producer for ""Daybreak"" a morning show that is so perennially in last place that other networks mock it unmercifully. After telling Barnes that ""Daybreak"" needs what I need someone to believe in them"" she gets the job. Though we soon see that Fuller is quite good at what she does ""Daybreak"" which has had 14 executive producers in 11 years turns out to be more of a challenge than even she anticipates. The mainstay of the show is Colleen Peck expertly played by Keaton. In classic morning show form she is game for anything (at one point we see her wearing a fat suit and facing a sumo wrestler) but she is tired of being stuck in the cellar of having to ""pull the train up the hill with my teeth."" Her advice to her new young boss ""Enjoy the pain Gidget."" Adding to her problems Fuller has to replace Pecks male co-host sooner than she anticipates. Then she gets a brainstorm. IBS has a world-class anchor under contract the winner of 16 Emmys eight Peabodys and a Pulitzer. Thats right the legendary Mike Pomeroy a man Fuller reveres is in the house. Occasionally mistaken for Dan Rather the egotistical Pomeroy turns out to be a real piece of work. Yes hes won a ton of awards but as played with fine Mr. Cranky conviction by Ford hes allowed that to go to his head. Not shy about reminding people that he ""pulled Colin Powell from a burning jeep and put a cool washcloth on Mother Teresas forehead during a cholera epidemic"" Pomeroy has real contempt for morning news and is not afraid to show it. So rather than be part of the team Pomeroy makes life impossible for everybody referring to Peck as ""Miss Pacoima"" rejecting typical morning news assignments and even refusing to say the word ""fluffy"" on the air. Naturally this makes Fuller crazy. And it also hurts a possible romance with Adam Bennett a hunky newsmagazine producer played by Patrick Wilson (formerly of ""Little Children"" and now doing the best he can in the male version of the girlfriend role). This is certainly an excellent setup and its aided by how accurate ""Morning Glory"" feels to the nuts and bolts realities of the a.m. TV world. But having gotten this far the film proceeds to stumble and lose its way giving itself up to formulaic plot elements that are not as engaging as the stuff thats come before. McAdams performance is worth the price of admission but a resolution as satisfying as her work is not to be found. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe actors Jeff Goldblum is in it for the Glory if not...October 31 2010Hollywoods new movie mathJanuary 20 2009Joel Siegel 63; film critic on ABC morning news showJune 30 2007Morning Glory Will Come Cbs Team SaysJanuary 19 1987MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentRachel McadamsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-morning-glory-20101110,0,1981133.story",200,morningglory26,morningglory,latimes

This is the kind of dress a screen heroine wears when a slow-building love plot is coming to a head; it is the perfect costume for say leaving one suitor to run across Manhattan to another. Which McAdamss Becky ultimately does although the competitors for her attention are professional rather than personal. Becky is wearing this get-up--the modern-day equivalent of something Kim Novak might have worn in Picnic--to an interview for what is referred to multiple times as ""the biggest job in broadcasting."" However absurd the outfits also appropriate The only love Morning Glory truly cares about is the passionate but sexless amour fou between a girl and her work.Becky is toiling away on a small-time show in Jersey--turning off prospective dates by not turning off her constantly ringing phone; waking up for tomorrows editorial meetings before tonights last call--when her position is suddenly eliminated leaving her with not a whole lot to occupy her time and overactive mind. Unemployed for roughly 90 seconds of screen time (which includes a nicely modulated exchange with her passive-aggressively overcritical mom played by Patti DArbanville who dismisses Beckys ambition as ""embarrassing"") she jumps at an offer to take a job nobody wants executive producing the failing morning show Daybreak.Facing hostile skepticism from her network boss (Jeff Goldblum stealing scenes on autopilot) and a pill-popping anchor diva (Diane Keaton gamely making the most of a role that mocks her for being old) Becky swiftly proves her worth by firing Daybreaks pervy male co-host and replacing him with Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford). A grizzled evening-news vet who only takes the gig to satisfy a contractual loophole Mike feels daytime TV is beneath him and refuses to participate in the cutesy segments that are the shows bread and butter.And so the films major conflict is set ""The world has been debating news vs. entertainment for years and guess what? You lost"" Becky chides former war correspondent Mike. In need of a ratings boost in order to secure the shows future Becky starts scripting stunts for maximum YouTube potential while Mikes fuck-this attitude increasingly seeps onto air. Ultimately the two push-and-pull toward a compromise between ""bran and doughnuts"" (or the newsertainment equivalent). You could call their snappy back-and-forth ""banter""--at one point Mike defines banter as ""from the Latin word for jibber like a moron ""--but this is hardly high screwball McAdams is mostly a perky and patient pitcher setting Ford up for all the best lines.And still McAdams who has rarely lived up to the ingenue potential evident six years ago in The Notebook gives a real star turn here which is all the more remarkable considering the apparent effort director Roger Michell took to avoid the visual shorthand (beaming beauty-filtered close-ups dowdy-to-dazzling post-makeover toe-to-head pans etc.) that the Katherine Heigls of the world use as crutches. Becky is designed as a kind of live-action comic-strip character--a hot-bodied Cathy with the defeated hunch of Charlie Brown and Betty Coopers shaggy-sensible bangs and ponytail--whose haplessness is oft patronizingly branded as ""adorable."" Michell favors wide tracking shots that more often than not frame McAdams from afar the better to show her full body in graceful near-slapstick action. He saves the close-ups for when McAdams can make the most of them In one particularly striking scene the realization of Beckys place in the dating evolutionary order washes over her face and completely changes the tenor of the characters ambition. But after a moment like that Michell usually launches a montage set to a truly terrible pop-rock ""classic.""Such stock tricks of the genre do little to make up for the fact that Glorys central non-professional romance is cursory and unconvincing. The love interest here is a hunky Patrick Wilson who forces Becky to put her BlackBerry in the freezer before hell have sex with her. That theres no sexual charge between McAdams and Wilson might be a chemical problem between the actors but it could also be intentional Work is what turns on Morning Glorys most charismatic characters to the point that outside relationships seem dull in comparison. That idea and Michells occasional counterintuitive stylistic choices sometimes make you forget that youre watching a generic product.

Shes sharp sexy and funny. Too bad the script does not permit her to be all three at the same time. More about Morning Glory >> After Becky Fuller (McAdams) is fired as assistant producer of ""Good Morning New Jersey"" she gets hired as producer/ringmaster of ""Daybreak"" a morning show with ratings in the cellar and staff morale in the sub-basement. Can Becky revive the moribund show? Can the gal who rises at 330 am and is all in by 7 pm find romance? Can this cookie forge a workplace alliance with crusty Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) a newsman old enough to be her father? The script from Aline Brosh McKenna (screenwriter of The Devil Wears Prada) juggles the balls of workplace comedy job-versus-love conflict and displaced daddy/daughter romance. In the hands of director Roger Michell (Notting Hill) they do not stay up in the air but drop thud dribble. When Becky fires the sleazy foot fetishist who is one of Daybreaks co-anchors she is left with Colleen (Diane Keaton) who chirpily predicts that the newbie will fail ""like everyone before you."" To give the show some tough to complement Colleens fluff Becky taps Mike a hard-news legend running out the clock on his contract. You would think that with two deft Hollywood veterans at his disposal Michell would let Keaton do her airy and Ford his wary thing. You would be wrong. Unaccountably Keaton is underutilizeed if funny. A subplot involving Becky and TV executive played by Patrick Wilson scored to adult-alternative rock likewise goes nowhere. What Morning Glory has going for it is McAdams who has the motormouth delivery ideal for comedy and who nails the micromanager mentality of kindred McKenna heroines in Prada and 27 Dresses. These are women who are lovely could run empires and we are led to believe have trouble getting dates. An antecedent of this type of Type A female professional is the Holly Hunter character in Broadcast News. But though their milieus and personal problems are similar Becky couldnt be further from News Jane Craig. Jane sets the bar high and fights to keep the news fluff-free. What a difference 20-odd years makes Beckys all about lowering the bar and chasing those ratings. (Some of the funniest involve the weatherman nicely played by Mtt Malloy). When Mike complains that doing soft-news segments would dull his hard-news edge Becky snaps ""That battle is over. You lost."" In rhythm humor and performance Morning Glory is at best sporadic.

Instead he shows up in the morning when the questions are cuddlier and the tone less confrontational. The day-night news divide has defined infotainment intake for years even if the new romantic comedy and Broadcast News shadow Morning Glory treats it as a new development. Peppy executive producer Becky (Rachel McAdams) takes the helm of a foundering network morning show and gets a pithy welcome from a new colleague ""Were like The Today Show except without the money viewers and respect."" But Becky has a plan. In need of a new co-anchor to pair with former beauty queen Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton doing a softer and blander variation on Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada) she reaches out to a grizzled newshound left in the journalism wilderness. Cue Harrison Ford trying out a Clint Eastwood growl and a series of eye-rolling grimaces that get genuine laughs the first dozen times or so.Morning Glory has its charms including a gift of gab that keeps you on your toes for the first third of the movie and a willingness to poke shallow reportage in the eye. It asks the not-so-tough questions ""On psychic animals would you rather have a parakeet or an iguana?"" McAdams shows a spark that burns brightest when Becky anxiously faces her programs absence of standards. Director Roger Michell (Notting Hill Changing Lanes) knows his way around a tracking shot and he imbues Morning Glory with an exaggerated antic energy familiar to anyone who has spent time in a pressurized newsroom.But unless youve never seen Broadcast News or Prada the whole thing feels like a copy of a copy. Beckys romance with newsmagazine producer (Patrick Wilson who has a talent for simultaneously acknowledging and mocking his good looks) feels shoehorned in a distraction meant for the many who dont want to see a movie about journalists trying to commit journalism. Keaton and Ford old pros cast here in a Hepburn-and-Tracy mold have some fine moments as individuals but the movie is too boilerplate to make their relationship anything but symbolic. Their characters are mere sketches. Hes the crusty Pulitzer winner. Shes the mistress of fluff. We get it. What else ya got?Not a whole lot. Morning Glory hints tepidly at a truce or compromise between the merchants of fluff and the hard-core newshounds. Its third alternative however is a diluted contrivance that comes off as a convenient way to end the story not an organic extension of the plot. No a Hollywood movie doesnt need to serve as media criticism. But dont serve yesterdays news pretend to treat it as vital and then turn it into a mere bauble. Thats the path of least resistance.

Its a losing battle ""Morning Glory is itself a work of extreme fluff a lightweight bauble about the morning-show wars that floats on the updrafts of character comedy until it charmingly self-destructs in the final act.Rachel McAdams has the lead role of Becky Fuller New Jersey girl and workaholic news producer who gets her big shot when she is hired to executive produce the IBS networks ""Daybreak out of the ratings basement. Becky can turn the world on with her smile; she can take a nothing day and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile. Thats right shes Mary Tyler Moore down to the jig in the streets.McAdams is actually quite endearing as she tailors a Katherine Heigl role to her smarter specifications but anyone who knows anything about the media business also knows that endearing is served for lunch and that those who succeed have to be powerful and/or pirates. Especially the women. So fine its a fairy tale complete with a prince (Patrick Wilson as a swoony producer for a magazine show) whom the movie beds down with Becky early on so we know its not really about winning the guy.The ""Daybreak the heroine inherits is a squabbling family headed by Colleen (Diane Keaton) a onetime beauty queen turned acid-tongued anchorwoman. In desperation Becky blackmails the networks idled news god Pomeroy into serving as Colleens cohost. The grizzled veteran of Bosnia the reporter who pulled Colin Powell out of a burning jeep is now forced to introduce segments on Easter eggs and reincarnation and his horror is palpable. Keaton is fun but Ford gives a character performance that is positively inspired his voice sinking to a sub-Clint Eastwood growl as the moral disgust rolls off Pomeroy in waves. In the stars hands a throwaway line like ""And when we come back well tell you new ways to cope with . . . menopause becomes a marvelous exercise in comic self-loathing.In another scene the newsman accuses Becky of ""wanting me to pander so you can sell erectile dysfunction medication hinting at a struggle between morning-show style and hard news substance that ""Morning Glory doesnt really intend to engage. ""Broadcast News this aint and forget about ""Network -- by the final scenes screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and director Roger Michell appear to have come down squarely on the side of pandering. No wonder Ford looks so grumpy.Still the movies a pleasant and occasionally hilarious ride even if theres a bait-and-switch at its core. The central relationship is between Becky and Pomeroy but because the actors playing them are too far apart in years the filmmakers have to introduce Wilsons character as a love interest. Hes a beard pure and simple and ""Morning Glory is in fact structured as a professional romance between the naive TV producer and the aging news lion. The movie cannily sells a multigenerational cast but cross-generational amour remains the love that dare not speak its name.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"""Morning Glory"" 1/2 - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs ""Morning Glory"" 1/2Morning Glory a 2 1/2 starsNovember 09 2010|By Michael Phillips | Tribune movie criticMen like her. Women like her. Dentists adore her. When she was bratting around the edges of ""Mean Girls"" Rachel McAdams had yet to ease into her true qualities. But now the performer blessed with the major-league toothsome smile has far far more than dewy youth in her favor. There are plenty of nice faces in the movies. Some are even worth 11 12 bucks for a couple of stargazing hours. McAdams though can act. Shes genuinely versatile. She has an honest penetrating way of conveying a characters delight even when we may not believe the circumstances (""Wedding Crashers""). She brings a shrewd urgency and presence to genre pieces such as ""Red Eye"" and can elevate romance-novelistic hooey along the lines of ""The Notebook"" to the point where it becomes a hit. If the romantic comedy ""Morning Glory"" clicks with audiences the McAdams factor surely will be the reason why. She plays a variant on Mary Tyler Moores Mary Richards whose spunk was so memorably derided by Ed Asners Lou Grant. Here that salient quality is characterized as ""repellent moxie"" by the female protagonists primary adversary an old-school Murrow-esque legend played by Harrison Ford. Plot After being downsized out of a job on ""Good Morning New Jersey"" Becky Fuller (McAdams) convinces the producer ( Jeff Goldblum) of a low-rated Manhattan-based morning show to give her a shot. Her show-runner mission is to turn the low-rated ""Daybreak"" (""just like The Today Show wihtout the money viewers or respect"") into something more than a sinkhole. Becky arm-twists Mike Pomeroy (Ford) to co-anchor against his will opposite an ex-beauty pagaent flibbertigibbet ( Diane Keaton without enough to do). Romance blooms for Becky in the form of the Ivy league dreamboat played by Patrick Wilson. Each complication in Aline Brosh McKennas script does its clinically prescribed job and makes way for the next. Director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") makes New York and environs look very pretty. I do wish though that Ford had found a more interesting attack on his bull-headed character. His performance is built entirely on discomfort -- the characters own as well as the unease it generates in others. Ford lays it on so thickly he keeps grinding the scenes to a halt. Thats the great thing about Keaton (though youd hardly know it here the way her character is marginalized) She knows rhythm and has her ear tuned to the overall scene not just her measures within it. Same goes for McAdams who pours on the can-do optimism and pep and yes spunk without exhausting the audience. Too much of the script makes too little sense When the heroines mother (Patti DArbanville) urges Becky to flush her dreams and do something practical you think Wait. This kids been out of work for like 10 minutes and youre saying nix on broadcast journalism? Not that it was striving to be ""Broadcast News"" but ""Morning Glory"" comes a lot closer in its sensibility to ""That Girl."" Which Marlo Thomas sold quite well. McAdams does likewise here. Clearly shes jazzed about proving herself up against pros as disparate as Keaton Goldblum and -- despite his stridency -- Ford. It pays off with the rom-com equivalent of a glass half-full. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for some sexual content including dialogue language and brief drug references) Cast Rachel McAdams (Becky Fuller); Harrison Ford (Mike Pomeroy); Diane Keaton (Colleen Peck); Patrick Wilson (Adam Bennett); Jeff Goldblum (Jerry Barnes) Credits Directed by Roger Michell; written by Aline Brosh McKenna; produced by J.J.

"Morning Glory review Pleasant Morning doesnt win the day |       NJ.com comments Morning Glory review Pleasant Morning doesnt win the day Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 09 2010 at 808 AM View/Post Comments Macall Polay/Courtesy Paramount Pictures/MCTThe morning national news program ""Daybreak"" has a new producer Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams left) who must contend with the shows gruff host Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) in the comedy ""Morning Glory."" Sometimes a movie is such easy fun you wish it had pushed itself just a little harder. Pictures like these are pleasant enough. But like some middle-school underachiever theyre content to coast -- turning in B work when with some extra effort they could pull down an A. ""Morning Glory"" for example is a good little movie. But it could have been a great little movie. It stars Rachel McAdams as one of Hollywoods favorite cliches -- the career woman who can micromanage everything except her own life. When the film opens shes working hard in a dead-end job in local TV producing ""Good Morning New Jersey."" Then she gets her big chance sort of -- a suicide mission to revamp a bottom-rated New York morning show. Where she decides to pair the flops grinning matron with a legendarily grumpy old newsman. After this break cute clashes conflict and romance. Movie Review MORNING GLORY (PG-13) Paramount (95 min.) Directed by Roger Michell. With Rachel McAdams Harrison Ford Diane Keaton. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations substance abuse strong language. Stephen Whittys review THREE STARS Yes it sounds dangerously like a Katherine Heigl picture. But Rachel McAdams is very winning in the lead mixing an innocent motor-mouth with ambition that if not naked is at least sexily PG-13. Harrison Ford overdoes the grumpiness a bit but he gets the journalists self-serious gravitas right. And Diane Keaton playing against type as a quick-tempered diva is a genuine delight. Yet even as youre having a good time at ""Morning Glory"" -- an easy thing for starved fans of grown-up romantic comedies -- its hard not to wish the film were even better or that beyond the jokes there was something slightly serious at stake. McAdams sole purpose as the shows producer is to drive up ratings. She doesnt care how -- and the film doesnt care that she doesnt care. Send the nervous weatherman off on death-defying stunt? Broadcast a Pap smear? Sounds great Well no it doesnt. Particularly when you compare this to ""Broadcast News."" That picture had romance live-TV comedy and a type-A heroine too. But it was also about something -- the conflict between faked telegenic ""moments"" and hard-news reality. It stood for certain values and so did heroine Holly Hunter. And thats what made it not just a fun film but a classic. Rachel McAdams stars as Becky Fuller in Paramount Pictures comedy ""Morning Glory."" The attack of the warm and fuzzies in ""Morning Glory"" is a bit of a surprise coming from director Roger Michell who in the smart ""Changing Lanes"" and excellent ""The Mother"" previously showed an ease with prickly moral questions. It is not a surprise however coming from scripter Aline Brosh McKenna whose adaptation for ""The Devil Wears Prada"" similarly pandered to its presumed audience. Its heroine was never judged too harshly; female ambition however was. Still ""Morning Glory"" has attractive stars and a good soundtrack. Garden Stater McKenna sticks in a Jersey joke or two (McAdams alma mater is mocked as ""Fairleigh Ridiculous University"") and the New York locations sparkle. Its a good enough movie. But it came this close to being great.

Were there not a good 35 years between them Rachel McAdams and Harrison Ford would make an excellent onscreen couple. Shame then that their considerable chemistry is harnessed for purely professional purposes in ""Morning Glory"" a genially midrange if overlong romantic comedy from director Roger Michell. Updating ""Broadcast News"" for a more journalistically toxic era the Paramount release has precious little edge though it does manage a decent enough laughs-to-duds ratio and its highly compatible cast should be attraction enough to land some solid returns when it opens wide on Nov. 10. When devising lead characters few modern romantic comedies seem to grasp the fine-line distinction between likably eccentric and exhaustingly neurotic but McAdams fortunately lands on the right side of the equation here. As Becky Fuller a driven 28-year-old morning news producer she believably creates a woman who can micromanage several dozen demanding tasks at once yet nods ""yes"" when talking on the phone; who is surgically attached to her BlackBerry yet sometimes leaves her apartment with no pants. While the character could have easily edged into cartoonish territory McAdams keeps her wits about her exhibiting a flustery physicality that is delightful to watch. As written by ""The Devil Wears Prada"" scribe Aline Brosh McKenna McAdams character faces a dilemma virtually identical to Anne Hathaways in ""Prada"" Both are idealistic young news junkies subservient to respected yet abusive mentors and pressured by script contrivances into anemic romantic subplots. A lover of that distinctly American hodgepodge of actual news cooking segments and time-killing human interest stories Becky gets her big break into the morning news world when shes hired by a fatalistic exec (Jeff Goldblum) at fictional net IBS (zing) to produce the channels ""Daybreak."" Routinely last in the ratings and cursed with a revolving cast of male counterparts for anchor Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) the show is soon threatened with cancellation unless Becky can reverse its fortunes. Enter Fords Mike Pomeroy a fatuous semi-retired Dan Rather-style newsman Becky unwillingly recruits through a contractual loophole. Pomeroy makes no secret of his disgust for the shows soft-focus approach while Becky begins exploring ever more ""Jackass""-style stunts to attract attention. The expected showdown between hard journalism and fluffy entertainment never quite materializes -- in fact a number of hinted-at subplots simply disappear -- but the bickering between Ford and McAdams (and to a lesser degree Ford and Keaton) throws off some great sparks. Theres none of that fire between Becky and her studly young beau (Patrick Wilson) however as the two seem destined for conflict-free coupledom from first meeting. Pics technical pedigree is solid though director Michell (""Notting Hill"") plays a number of plot points with eye-rolling obviousness and lays it on a bit thick at times. With a performer as energetic as McAdams surely theres no need to play two montages in fast-forward. Keaton is fine but marginal here though she gamely kisses frogs and does an extremely square dance with 50 Cent. Fords character is a bit one-note and his gravelly intonation suggests a drunken poet more than a respected newsman yet he makes a meal of the role all the same and his pronunciation of the word ""frittata"" may well be the films high point.

Daily Edition Login to download Morning Glory Film Review 907 PM PDT 11/1/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An opportunity to update ""Broadcast News"" falls flat with too much sitcom and not enough sting. TWITTER In Morning Glory a highly caffeinated young producer of a national morning TV show urges her two aging and cranky co-hosts to get outside their comfort zone to reverse their dismal ratings. Too bad this comedy fails to take its heroines advice because the movie never sneaks away from a comfy sitcom mode. Turning points and character reveals arrive on cue a romance blooms fades and resuscitates as expected and never once does the movie dare to confront its actual subject the fate of news in the age of YouTube and TMZ. It merely recycles 1987s Broadcast News with only a single reference to YouTube. Writer Aline Brosh McKenna who penned the fashion-world hit comedy The Devil Wears Prada again explores how a working girl must learn to navigate a volatile environment. But this time the scribe seems like shes out of her element. The film is as manufactured as ... well a cheerful morning-news show. Notting Hill director Roger Michell manages a few laughs and a chuckle here and there and he certainly has a stellar cast. Rachel McAdams playing the plucky producer should attract younger women and Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton as the contentious co-hosts will appeal to older women. Paramount might see midrange numbers opening week; after that though Morning Glory might be as downward-trending as its fictional show Daybreak. Its telling that the film gets many of its best laughs not in behavior or action but from characters flip descriptions of Daybreaks sorry reputation. Another networks softball team says the producers boss (Jeff Goldblum) wears hats that declare ""At Least Were Not Daybreak."" Fords Mike Pomeroy once a superlative news broadcaster and reporter is according to a newsmagazine producer (Patrick Wilson) ""the third-worst person in the world."" McAdams Becky Fuller later promotes him to No. 1. Meanwhile Keatons ColleenPeck is ""a former Miss Arizona."" So Beckys mission impossible is to revive a fourth-place morning show or face cancellation. Host Colleen welcomes sharing a desk and couch with the bitter disgraced -- you never learn why -- newsman Pomeroy the way she might welcome a social disease. Its toxic between them from Day 1 as themes of style-vs.-substance and entertainment-vs.-news play out. But as even Becky notes the news department lost that one long ago. So why isnt this movie focusing on what youd really have to do to get out of a ratings basement? Oh sure Becky finally puts the shows hapless weatherman (Matt Malloy quite wonderful) on a roller coaster and then a terrifying skydive and Colleen mixes it up with a sumo wrestler. But would that really be outrageous enough? The Ford-Keaton pairing offers all sorts of possibilities as a latter-day Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn duo. Their acidic quarrels with a dash of love/hate might have been the very thing that would lure viewers from Today. But the film never considers this possibility. Only in one instance does their rancor make it on the air. Pity for in that fleeting moment the movie finally has some bite. The movie never gets as deliciously bitchy as Prada. It has the divas harried staffers and a tenacious failure-is-not-an-option heroine. But it runs away from true shocks. McAdams Ford and Keaton are all good as far as it goes but these are mostly one-note performances.
