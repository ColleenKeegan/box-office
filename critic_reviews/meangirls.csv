Once there she immediately grasps that the pitiless laws of the jungle apply equally readily to the various sharp-toothed species of American teendom. A scowly artiste (Caplan) and a zinger-zapping gay guy (Franzese) adopt comely Cady as one of their own and just for laughs set her on an undercover mission to infiltrate the a consortium of high priestesses led by terrifying alpha girl Regina (McAdams). Tina Feys deft precisely detailed script dramatises Rosalind Wisemans bestseller Queen Bees and Wannabes. Happily Fey and Waters gently tweak the studios usual high-gloss caricature of adolescence and aim for acutely hilarious and surprisingly empathic sociology.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Comedy That Cliques washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Comedy That Cliques Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 30 2004 ""Mean Girls"" boasts a one-two-three punch in star Lindsay Lohan screenwriter Tina Fey and director Mark Waters and indeed it delivers a knockout. Smart funny well-acted and visually lively this movie by rights should become a certified teen-comedy hit well before the usual season for that genre begins. And if reactions at a recent preview showing are any indication ""Mean Girls"" will appeal not only to those adolescents with whom its cliques catfights and other mortifications of high school will painfully -- and amusingly -- resonate. Their parents may want to catch this pitch-perfect satire too -- provided of course that they see it at another time in another theater and preferably in another Zip code than their offspring. Lohan plays Cady Heron who has lived most of her life in Africa but whose parents have moved back to the States for her junior year in high school. As Cady is initiated into the tribal customs of adolescence replete with its kill-or-be-killed fights for alpha status she cant help being reminded of life in the state of nature. The difference she quickly learns is that even the biggest strongest and meanest wildebeest has nothing on a spoiled 16-year-old popularity queen with blond hair and perfect skin. That latter form of wildlife is represented in ""Mean Girls"" by Regina George (Rachel McAdams) who runs her clique known to its victims as the Plastics with the imperiousness her name implies. Ruling her high school on the North Side of Chicago with a combination of ersatz kindness and breathtaking cruelty Regina inspires awe and rank fear in her fellow students who testify to her powers in a funny montage. (""She punched me in the face once"" says one chubby girl. ""It was awesome."") Nonplussed by the signs and signifiers of what she comes to call Girl World Cady gives the Plastics wide berth gravitating instead to the class bohemians and math nerds. But Cady cant avoid Reginas all-encompassing grasp forever and soon the two are the best of frenemies enmeshed in an ever-widening web of mutual manipulation and deceit. Things are complicated by the fact that Cady has a crush on Reginas ex-boyfriend. And as one of the Plastics solemnly informs her ""ex-boyfriends are off-limits to friends -- thats just a rule of feminism"" Adapted by Fey from the self-help bestseller ""Queen Bees and Wannabes"" ""Mean Girls"" has its Jungle Red-painted finger firmly on the pulse of contemporary high school life in which humiliation and terror seem to have increased as exponentially as skin-coverage has decreased. The putdowns have become more stinging the rumors more lethal the sexual stakes vertiginously high; to compare an affluent American high school to the African veld does a disservice to the civility of the common hyena. With her natural beauty and direct unaffected demeanor Cady at first seems to be no match for the knowing alarmingly precocious Regina but whats scary is how quickly she adapts to her new habitat. ""Mean Girls"" zips along propelled by Feys steady stream of funny one-liners and Waterss spirited visual style. (Many viewers will remember that he directed Lohan in last years terrific remake of ""Freaky Friday."") For example occasionally during Cadys voiceovers pondering the similarities of high school to the jungle the actors will suddenly start acting like wild animals a gambit that particularly pays off when a fountain in a shopping mall turns into an African watering hole. Lohan makes an enormously appealing young heroine who even when she seems in danger of going completely native manages to retain the audiences sympathy. The supporting cast is equally on its game here especially Lizzy Caplan and Daniel Franzese as Cadys boho friends and Tim Meadows and Fey as respectively the school principal and a teacher who becomes a Plastics victim. Fey brings her signature brand of wry humor to the role but her script betrays a heartening humanist streak underneath the supposed cynicism. For all its raunchy humor and the occasional gross gag ""Mean Girls"" tells some brave truths not just about high school but also about life. Like all good satires theres a message worth heeding even when its wit goes for the jugular. Just dont tell the kids. That would spoil everything. Mean Girls (93 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content language and some teenage drinking.

Lindsay Lohan Amanda Seyfried and Lacey Chabert star in Mean Girls. By Michael Gibson Paramount Pictures Grind these shrews down play on their insecurities and make them suffer spinal injuries. But wait -- were getting ahead of a story inspired by Rosalind Wisemans non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence (which pretty well hits the key plot elements). Then again how much help are parents giving when our heroines dad (like his wife an Africa-based zoologist) is so unattuned to American mores that he doesnt know that ""grounded"" means not being allowed to leave home? ABOUT THE MOVIE Mean Girls    (out of four) Stars Lindsay Lohan Rachel McAdams Tina Fey Director Mark Waters Distributor Paramount Rating PG-13 for sexual content language and some teen partying Opens Friday nationwide This is OK because new girl Cady (Lindsay Lohan) proves resourceful enough to deal with instant adversaries with assistance from two outcast pals (gay male freak female) she meets on Day 1 of school. But attractive Cady is co-opted by the school-ruling ""Plastics"" whom she had set out to combat once they allow her into a social circle whose own members backbite each other. Funniest of the Plastics is the queen bee (Regina) played by Rachel McAdams who has past credits like Shotgun Love Dolls and The Hot Chick on her resume. McAdams has both the blond looks and comic flair to make a direct hit as a high school villainess who on Cadys recommendation starts munching miracle diet pills. Too bad that in reality theyre what the schools football players ingest to beef themselves up. Girls gets a key boost from the supporting characterizations which include prize turns from current and former Saturday Night Live players Tina Fey (the movies screenwriter) as a recently divorced and now sexually frustrated teacher; Tim Meadows as a school principal with carpal tunnel syndrome; and Amy Poehler as Reginas ditzy mother who still dresses and acts like the 18-year-old she longs to be. And although producer Lorne Michaels big-screen filmography is enough to get every cinephile on a Great Books program (remember Tommy Boy and A Night at the Roxbury?) this time his movie and SNL-caliber laughs arent mutually exclusive. Girls which gets funnier as it goes is his best since 1992s Waynes World and a sparky follow-up for Lohan and director Mark Waters to last years PG-rated Freaky Friday. But this time the tone is a long way from Disney even if both movies are alike in having titles that quickly sum up their comic sensibilities and suggest promise thats delivered.

And 15-year-old Cady (Lindsay Lohan) a fresh-faced teen making her debut in public school after years of home-schooling is like a mouse in a den full of satisfied-looking lions. Which clique will devour her -- the art freaks? The band geeks? The math team? Or the Plastics a trio of miniskirted girls whose faces have the perfect sheen of a cellophane-wrapped fashion magazine and who soon fix Cady in their mascara-rimmed gaze? ""Mean Girls"" directed by Mark Waters (""Freaky Friday"") and written by Tina Fey (""Saturday Night Live"") resembles Amy Heckerlings terrific 1995 ""Clueless"" in its zingy wit and glossy look -- and like that movie it holds many pleasures for those well out of their teens. (Note the melancholy character named Janis Ian.) But its got an appealing nastiness of its own. High-school hallways are scary turf and Fey (who also plays the hip math teacher Ms. Norbury) knows it. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Mean Girls"" with Lindsay Lohan Rachel McAdams Tim Meadows Ana Gasteyer Amy Poehler Tina Fey. Directed by Mark Waters from a screenplay by Fey based on a book by Rosalind Wiseman. 95 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content language and some teen partying. Several theaters. The Plastics for example smoothly spell out the rules for inclusion in their elite group. You must wear pink on Wednesdays and you can only wear your hair in a ponytail once a week. (Eyeing Cadys hair with concern a Plastic chirps helpfully ""um so I guess todays your day"") You may not date ex-boyfriends of group members and you need to understand the primal importance of being a Plastic. ""All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends"" says one dismissing a boys name from conversation with a roll of her eyes. Feys screenplay bubbles over with shrewd mini-characterizations like the disgruntled sex-ed teacher who spews advice like ""If you touch each other you will get chlamydia and die"" or the desperate-to-be-young mother of an ultra-popular girl bopping around in chic sweatpants and pretending to be her daughters best friend. And while lessons are most definitely learned -- Cady finds herself becoming a Mean Girl and must shake up Girl World to escape this fate -- theres a bracingly chilly tone throughout. As befits its title ""Mean Girls"" never gets gooey. Waters cast which includes a number of Feys ""Saturday Night Live"" compatriots (Tim Meadows in particular is wonderfully nervous as a school principal who looks like hed really rather be doing something else) hits all the right notes and Lohan remains an immensely appealing teen star. Amanda Seyfried makes a hilarious movie debut as the most dimwitted Plastic Karen who has special powers. (""My breasts can tell when its going to rain"" she confides wide-eyed. Then in the interest of full disclosure she elaborates ""Well they can tell when its raining."") Its really the dialogue sharp as a perfectly manicured fingernail that deserves top billing here. (That and perhaps the dirtiest bump-and-grind rendition of ""Jingle Bell Rock"" that youll ever see.) And within those funny lines are a few nonpreachy thoughts about self-acceptance that teenage girls would do well to heed. Tart and refreshing ""Mean Girls"" is the kind of high-school movie that really feels as if its for grown-ups -- but hey the teens can come too.

(AP Photo/ Michael Gibson) (Left to right) Lindsay Lohan as Cady Amanda Seyfried as Karen Rachel McAdams as Regina and Lacey Chabert as Gretchen in Mean Girls. (AP Photo/ Michael Gibson) Photo MICHAEL GIBSON Its yet another high school comedy but Mean Girls has a talented cast and a wickedly intelligent script 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Mean Girls Comedy. Starring Lindsay Lohan Rachel McAdams Tina Fey and Lacey Chabert. Directed by Mark Waters. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Mean Girls"" is a smart little comedy that tries within the limits of the teen-movie form to say some real things about high school girls and the struggle for popularity. Screenwriter Tina Fey writes with wit and observation and she has a strong advantage in Mark Waters a director who knows comedy and knows how to build performances. Here Waters puts together a talented ensemble of young actors and then directs them in a way that emphasizes comic fluidity flexibility and scale. Its no coincidence or lucky accident of casting that all the supporting performances go right to the edge of absurdity without crossing the line into random zaniness. As in ""The House of Yes"" and ""Freaky Friday"" Waters keeps it wild but real and the result is not only a series of lively scenes but lively close-ups The big-eyed expressive performances are just fun to watch. It could have been generic. Lindsay Lohan plays Cady who moves with her former hippie parents from Africa to Illinois having been home-schooled all her life. She immediately falls in with two kids from the art crowd Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and her gay friend Damian (Daniel Franzese) who are both intelligent and humane. But when the schools reigning social divas known as ""the Plastics"" take an interest in her Cady decides with the encouragement of her arty friends to hang out with them. Supposedly shes doing it in a spirit of investigation but shes also being seduced. Related Stories Mean Girls succeeds where other teen comedy films fail High school is confusing and treacherous but its also training for real life. Spending time with the chief Plastic Regina (Rachel McAdams) Cady finds herself both hating her and wanting her approval -- a new feeling for her but actually a common human situation. Rachel McAdams brings glamour and magnetism to Regina but also the right hint of comic distance. McAdams nails the laugh for example when Regina offers up this supposedly damning description of a former boyfriend ""All he cares about is school and his Mom and his friends."" Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfield as Reginas lieutenants are also adroit. Seyfield has a great deadpan as the monumentally stupid Karen and Chabert in the more substantial role of Gretchen -- sly but insecure a born follower -- shows lots of skill and nuance. Typically in such films the lead character is the most bland the normal person whos there to respond to everybody elses eccentricities. Thats pretty much the case here but Lohan is sensitive and appealing a solid locus for audience sympathy. Feys script is full of funny schoolgirl slang (""Shut up"") and caustic riffs on various high school types -- the long-suffering principal (Tim Meadows) the obtuse jocks and best of all the hygiene teacher who keeps telling the kids that if they have sex theyll die. Fey also includes that rare specimen the cool teacher and assigns that role to herself. She plays it well with the amused rueful aura many of the best high school teachers have -- an aura that comes of being young and thought old and of being lost and thought wise. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

"The nasty brilliance of Mean Girls. Slate Sign In Sign Up The nasty brilliance of Mean Girls. The nasty brilliance of Mean Girls. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 29 2004 707 PM Female Trouble Mean Girls dissects the high-school cafeteria. By David Edelstein Delightfully mean As one who passed through adolescence when ""geek"" meant someone who bit the heads off chickens and the social-caste system of American juvenile culture was rarely acknowledged much less made sport of Ive wondered what its like to grow up with movies and TV shows that relentlessly deconstruct the high-school experience--not to mention with best sellers that carry titles like Rosalind Wisemans Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence. Does seeing it and reading about it help or is high school just such a social and hormonal chamber of horrors that no amount of knowledge--or irony--can mitigate the agony? Advertisement Lets see what the culture makes of Mean Girls (Paramount) a funny and good-natured hybrid of pop psychology and Saturday Night Live satire written by the 33-year-old head writer of SNL Tina Fey. She began with Wisemans nonfiction best seller a scattershot analysis of roles--girls are identified as ""Queen Bee"" ""Sidekick"" ""Floater"" ""Pleaser/Wannabe/Messenger"" etc.--broken up by tables maps exhortations and lots of anecdotes about females getting called sluts by other females. Thats followed by tips on how to empower ones daughter--I hate that word but nothing else really fits--to transcend her peer-designated persona and navigate successfully through that scary place that Wiseman calls ""Girl World."" The good thing about using Wisemans how-to manual as the basis for her screenplay is that it grounds Feys work in observed human behavior rather than like most SaturdayNight Live-affiliated movies produced by Lorne Michaels a limited performers limitless ego. Fey is not even the star She plays a frazzled but good-natured math teacher who turns into a Wiseman-like counselor. The protagonist is 16-year-old Cady (Lindsay Lohan from last years Freaky Friday) a newcomer to American high school after years of being taught by her parents in Africa--i.e. a clean slate. Fey has said it was a Paramount executive who asked her to make Cady the daughter of research zoologists instead of a home-schooled American--because home schooling is thought to be a little you know creepy. That might represent a kind of commercial gutlessness but it turns out to be a great idea because now Cady can look at teen rituals from an anthropological--or really zoological--perspective. Those kids around the fountain at the local mall Theyre like the beasts mating by the water hole. The subtle one-upmanship and sabotage It would happen on the veldt with claws and fangs. The early part of Mean Girls is like a mixture of Heathers (1989) and Goodfellas (1990) complete with breezy journalistic narration The nonconforming outcast Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan)--not the singer-songwriter but maybe a tribute to her--lays out the schools sundry cliques and draws a map of the segregated cafeteria. Its at lunch that Cady meets the popular and exclusive ""Plastics""--two blondes and a brunette led by the so-called fount of all evil Regina George (Rachel McAdams). Unexpectedly the Plastics glom onto Cady They think shes pretty and exotic and their inbred culture has made them desperate for fresh blood. Its in Cadys scenes with the Plastics that Feys comic gifts mesh with Wisemans first-hand research and the wit becomes dazzling. The director Mark Waters (FreakyFriday) dotes on his long-limbed actresses McAdams as the tigress Queen Bee Amanda Seyfried as the apotheosis of all dumb blonde jokes and the dark one Lacey Chabert as Gretchen Wieners the low girl on the Plastic totem pole and the one who labors almost hysterically to maintain her position. (She spends the movie trying to coin a slangy new phrase--""Its so fetch""--only to be incinerated by her Queen in a single line.) As the girls take turns posing in the mirror and critiquing their own calves shoulders and chests Lohans Cady gazes on them with zoological wonderment; and the actress has a natural redheaded Irish-American prettiness thats a nice contrast to these wiggly Barbie dolls. Yet the Plastics magnetize Cady who seeks their affirmation even as she ridicules them and tries (with Janis and another outcast the ""too gay to live"" Damien [playedby Daniel Franzese]) to bring them down. Actually I found these Plastics surprisingly likable compared to the ones I knew in junior high and high school who were less cliquey but more mean--or maybe they just seemed more mean because I was so horribly vulnerable to them. The danger they pose in MeanGirls is to Cadys soul Will she become the new Queen Bee and abandon her outcast pals? Or will she recover her ironic distance and transcend these absurd classifications? Theres not a lot of suspense--and in truth Mean Girls is more premise than plot. It runs out of comic steam toward the end when Cady and her dull hunk (Jonathan Bennett)--Reginas ex-boyfriend--actually get to you know talking. And it turns very peculiar indeed when Feys teacher gathers the girls together in the gym and tries to get them to recognize the patterns of envy and aggression that rule their lives--in effect to reprogram them. Yet even at its squarest the movies mixture of parody and therapy feels kind of ... hip. Maybe its that Fey--who has triumphed in the male-dominated (to put it mildly) world of TV comedy--wants to lampoon her female subjects without drawing too much blood. Male SNL style comedy is traditionally about one-upmanship and often nasty displays of comic potency but Fey really seems to want to make this a movie thats both scathing and healing. I can think of a few lissome high-school acquaintances Id love to watch it with--if they can fit their expanded fortysomething backsides into the seats. Whoops maybe I might need some of that healing therapy myself. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

I dont know whether such cheerful maidens stay up or at home for Saturday Night Live or if they noticed that the picture is infested with SNL luminaries on both sides of the camera -- notably Weekend Updates Tina Fey who wrote the nimble script from a nonfiction best-seller by Rosalind Wiseman with the concise title Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence and who also plays a tart-tongued teacher in the movie. Or whether they were as surprised as I was by how faithful the movie is to the basic tenets of the high school girlie movies currently proliferating like viruses on studio-release schedules. Namely that adolescent girls are every bit as mean as if not meaner than their male counterparts -- that their meanness manifests as passive aggression and verbal bitchery on a scale no pimply boy could aspire to. That the currency of status and barter among the clique elite includes Gucci and Prada preferably in shades of manic pink. And that the existential dilemma of every girl with an ounce of integrity is whether to succumb to the threats and blandishments of the airheaded in-crowd or stick with the dweeby outcasts. How the stakes have risen -- at least in the kind of high schools likely to make it into Hollywood movies -- since my day (girls high school London early 60s) when we all wore gym slips with ties and lace-up shoes and God help the girl who showed up in lipstick. In the pop culture of that period the nice girl was a straight-talking straight-As tomboy in crappy jeans the dweebs were bespectacled maidens in faded frocks hand-sewn by their mothers and the clique-y gorgons were underachieving ultrafemme Goldilocks in frilly frocks by Macys.Also in this issue Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm ELLA TAYLOR isnt above enjoying a good bar fight Moore versus Brosnan in Laws of Attraction. Today the song remains the same but the accessories have scaled up to the point of hysteria -- and why not given that parents nowadays (not just in Beverly Hills) give their daughters breast jobs as high school graduation presents? In Mean Girls Lindsay Lohan radiantly freckled but hardly nerdy in T-shirt and jeans plays Cady Heron a math wizard newly arrived in a Chicago suburb with her zoologist parents after years of homeschooling in Africa. Shes bright and personable and abysmally unprepared for the stab-as-stab-can feminine culture of North Shore High School. At first her education is supervised by the class rejects Janis Ian (Lizzy Caplan) an encouragingly foul-mouthed wench garbed in child-of-Elvira noir and named after the folk-rock star famous for ""At Seventeen"" one of the most lugubrious songs of teen angst ever written; and her buddy Damian (played with brio by Daniel Franzese who gets all the best lines) a chubby lad whos ""too gay to function."" Janis and Damian whose capacity for survival has been sharpened by routine persecution have the schools pernicious culture nailed. Still their warnings to Cady go unheeded when shes wooed by the weight-obsessed Gucci-clad Queen Bee Regina George (played with kittenish menace by Rachel McAdams) and her two stoolie sycophants (Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried).   Mean Girls is directed by Mark Waters who also made the hit teen comedy Freaky Friday. Watching his new film one sees how dependent that delightful movie was on its wicked premise -- a mother and daughter forced to switch bodies and lives -- and on the antic chemistry between Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis. In Mean Girls the dreadful Regina has an amusing mother too one of those awful women (deliciously rendered by SNLs Amy Poehler) who longs to be her daughters best friend and wears clothes that make her look like mutton dressed up as lamb. Shes no more than a brief sideshow though and one yearns for more of the cruel comedy of her relationship with her entertainingly unspeakable offspring. Lohan is a warm and engaging presence but shes completely outshone by the bad girls and when theyre offscreen Mean Girls is an oddly restrained barely plotted movie. Its only unifying premise is Cadys romance with Reginas amiable boyfriend (Jonathan Bennett) an afterthought with no visible personality and her dilemma over whether to lead the Math Club to victory in the championships. Its as if Waters assembled a bunch of performers -- including the wonderful Tim Meadows who plays the schools hapless principal -- who were born to be thorns in the flesh of the status quo and instructed them to remain calm at all times and pursue the happy morally uplifting ending. Thats what you get I guess for hitching Saturday Night Live to a faux self-help manual.

Waters; Author Tina Fey; Release Date Wide 04/30/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 97; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted April 29 2004 -- 1200 AM EDT Mean Girls is the second big-studio comedy released in as many weeks to be engineered from 1980s teen-movie DNA The ancestry of ""Heathers"" is evident in this sweet-tart comedy about female bitchiness in the high school jungle just as ""Big"" leaves its genetic fingerprints on ""13 Going on 30."" But ""Mean Girls"" is the first feature made from the stuff of Tina Fey a head writer at ""Saturday Night Live"" and exemplary Head Girl when it comes to sexy-smart. Hers is a feminine comedic sensibility in a mixed-message age of ""The Man Show"" leers and Britney Spears wiggles snark from The Onion and soap-bubble simpers from Jessica Simpson. And as such the movie - a vinegary fable with a Splenda aftertaste - is a harbinger of hope not only for future feminist comedies of any grit but also for ""SNL""-staffed feature films that dont disproportionately suck. ""Mean Girls"" written by Fey and directed by Mark Waters with the same gangly energy he brought to ""Freaky Friday"" marches along for good stretches of time to the toot of its own saxophone. (If only those damn mellow violins of lessons learned didnt sough in the end.) The story builds from the sociological foundations of ""Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence"" Rosalind Wisemans sharp-edged dissection of teen hierarchies. But for marquee purposes Wisemans brutal thesis - that adolescent girls are regularly cruel to one another in ways that would embarrass jackals - has been softened into a photogenic fictional narrative suitable for in-demand teen actress (and ""Freaky Friday"" star) Lindsay Lohan and shaped to include a clutch of ""SNL"" performers in cameos as teachers and parents. And for Feys own pleasure the script now includes excellent clique IDs straight out of an ""SNL"" sketch. (My favorite lunchroom table ""unfriendly black hotties."") Cady Heron (Lohan) enters high school in the suburbs of Chicago fresh from Africa where she grew up homeschooled by her researcher parents. In other words Cadys isolation in nature away from the trappings of American civilization makes her the perfect blank slate on which to record the evil that girls do. (Shes a tasty bit of fresh meat too; Cady may have grown up in the bush but embodied by the mascaraed Lohan in cleavage-busting little tops the child clearly wasnt deprived of a subscription to Lucky magazine.) The new student is easily adopted by a duo of arty outsiders. The math nerds want her in their club too. But Cady is also courted in a primate-smart way by a trio of vixens known as the Plastics led by Regina the schools imperiously blond queen bee (""The Hot Chick""s indistinct Rachel McAdams) with vacuous yes-girls Gretchen (""Party of Five""s Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried) trailing in her wake. And egged on by her arty prankster pals who urge her to infiltrate enemy territory as an undercover agent Cady finds herself turning more and more into a backstabbing Plastic bitch herself. (The comedic downside of Lohans rapid rise into a polished 17-year-old star is her increasing discomfort with playing goofy the flaw of precocious sophistication that marred her performance in ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen."") Cadys reversion from smart young woman to savage cat is observed by Fey playing the sardonic math teacher Ms. Norbury. And in the movies lesson plan of a moral climax Norbury - signature ""Weekend Update"" eyeglasses happily in place - lectures the entire female student population as well as those sitting in movie-theater seats on the hurts they inflict so casually when they play feline games. ""Calling somebody else fat will not make you any thinner"" she proclaims. ""Calling somebody stupid will not make you any smarter. And youve got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it all right for guys to call you that."" The movie is full of good ideas like that - ideas that parents or at least adult viewers may appreciate more than the target audience. But its not the speeches that matter in this activist comedy; its the light-touch vignettes that carry the most meaning in ""Mean Girls"" Look behind the glasses to Feys invaluable expressions of womanly deadpan dismay for advice on all things modern-girl.

Reteaming of Lindsay Lohan with her ""Freaky Friday"" director Mark Waters has enough spark to connect with the female-teen target demographic. Fans who found teen star Lindsay Lohans last outing ""Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen"" a little toothless may find the bite of ""Mean Girls"" more to their taste. Penned by ""Saturday Night Live"" writer/performer Tina Fey this sassy if wildly uneven comedy navigates the treacherous high school jungle that separates cool cliques from wannabes wading through some nasty behavior before delivering its moral message. Reteaming of Lohan with her ""Freaky Friday"" director Mark Waters doesnt conjure the same antic spirit but has enough irreverent spark to connect with the female-teen target demographic and perhaps beyond. The model here clearly is ""Clueless"" -- still the high water mark for post-John Hughes high school comedies -- with a nod to ""Heathers."" But the result feels perhaps closest to 1999 Drew Barrymore vehicle ""Never Been Kissed"" both in the awkwardness of its plotting and in the basic thread of an unhip girl going undercover to achieve popularity hurting her friends in the process and then emerging from hiding to dole out humanity lessons. Witty setup skips over the early life of Cady Heron (Lohan) whos been home-schooled through childhood by her zoologist parents in Africa and is experiencing her first day of real school at age 16. Constantly returning to the animal kingdom as her frame of reference Cady soon gets a sense of the complex subculture network of a Midwestern public high school. Desperate for friends she hooks up with outsider freaks Janis (Lizzy Caplan) a cynical punk and Damian (Daniel Franzese) whos ""almost too gay to function."" Determinedly aloof from the fray the duo warns Cady to steer clear of The Plastics an evil trio of Barbie dolls led by the school Queen Bee Regina (Rachel McAdams). But when Regina and her vacuous handmaidens Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and Karen (Amanda Seyfried) decide -- initially for sport -- to admit Cady to their circle she gets caught in the vicious game-playing of ""Girl World."" When Cady reveals she has a crush on resident hunk Aaron (Jonathan Bennett) Reginas treacherous nature emerges. This sets Cady off on a retaliation sabotage plan to strip the queen of her crown. Bouncing between her true friends Janis and Damian and the faux gal pals she attempts to bring down Cady shimmies up the popularity ladder but gets so giddy with the thrill of her sudden cool status that she momentarily loses sight of her real self. The fallout brings out the beast in the entire school population. Based on Rosalind Wisemans non-fiction book ""Queen Bees and Wannabes Helping Your Daughter Survive Cliques Gossip Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence"" the film amusingly delineates the minefield environment and ruthless caste system of high school. Fey succeeds in fleshing out the study of adolescent social dynamics into a comedy whose characters are both sufficiently stereotypical to be recognizable yet have enough fresh kinks to make them fun. The ""SNL"" fixtures scripting hand brings significant gains through her facility with wicked barbs and clever dialogue and her propensity for far more edgy humor than is usually found in this type of material. But Feys inexperience with extended narrative shows in the messy structure the inconsistent grasp of Cadys shifts between camps an occasional disregard for logic and a general lack of clean lines especially in the chaotic stretch after the girls duplicity is exposed to the school. Waters who showed an affection for cruel comedy in his debut ""The House of Yes"" clearly relishes the bitchy banter and fierce one-upmanship of the girls. And while the films erratic engine often runs low on steam after an effervescent start the director writer and cast give even the most reprehensible of the characters enough heart and vulnerability to keep the audience invested in them. As she did in ""Freaky Friday"" Lohan displays plenty of charm verve and deft comic timing as she switches between innocence and craftiness. The actress has a confidence strength of character and unforced feistiness that make her an empowering mascot for young girls. McAdams Chabert and Seyfried are funny as spectacularly groomed self-absorbed dolts while Caplan and Franzese score all the best lines and deliver them with panache. In her first feature role Fey has some winning moments as a math teacher trying to keep Cady on the right path. Pic was produced by ""SNL"" creator Lorne Michaels and includes other alumni from the show in its cast among them Tim Meadows as the school principal Amy Poehler as Reginas trussed-up airhead mother and Ana Gasteyer as Cadys more down-to-earth mom. Pic has the standard glossy visual energy of good teen pics plus plenty of snappy wardrobe and a song collection that sets the tone of girl-on-girl warfare with a cover of Blondies ""Rip Her to Shreds."" Also featured is teen-femme angst anthem ""At Seventeen"" by Janis Ian the name given to Caplans character. Rolfe Kents African-themed score plays up the animal kingdom parallel.

"Mean Girls | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mean-girls ) Mean Girls (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Although Mean Girls is likely to be frequently compared to Heathers and perhaps occasionally to Election the movie it most strongly reminds me of is 1999s Jawbreaker. All four of these films offer a darkly satirical perspective of high school and popularity but while Heathers and Election follow things through to the bitter end Mean Girls like Jawbreaker loses its comic momentum before the closing credits roll. In this case the ending is more sappy than happy and gives us the sense that the screenplay betrays its origins in order to avoid an unsettling denouement. As a result Mean Girls works for its first three-quarters then implodes as it approaches the finish line. In high school more than at any other time in life you are judged by your friends. Theres a clique for almost every type of student - even the loners have their exclusive group. In the lunchroom you are where you sit and if you dont fit in youre not invited. The high school pecking order which favors good looks and brawn over brains and glasses dictates that jocks cheerleaders and would-be models are royalty while members of the chess club are to be avoided as if they carry a social plague. Most students eventually happily settle into their niche but even the most anti-establishment would be lying if they claimed never to toy with thoughts of what it might like to be popular. Because popularity means power friends dates and favors and when youre a teenager what could be better? Mean Girls introduces us to Cady Heron (Linday Lohan) a 16-year old girl who is going to high school for the first time. After being home schooled for most of her life by parents who traveled all around the world Cady is finally getting a chance to enter a suburban Illinois hell of peer pressure and hormones. Her first day is a disaster - the only one to pay any attention to her is her math teacher Ms. Norbury (Tina Fey). But on day two a couple of outsiders befriend her. One is a goth girl named Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and the other is an overweight gay guy named Damian (Daniel Franzese). They teach her the ways of the school jungle which as it turns out isnt that different from the African jungle where Cady spent some of her life. Then unexpectedly Cady is invited to sit at the table of the three ""plastics"" - the high schools queen and two princesses. Their leader Regina (Rachel McAdams) isnt only the prettiest and most popular girl in school shes also the biggest bitch on campus. She is served by her two handmaidens shallow Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) and dumb Karen (Amanda Seyfried). For reasons of their own the plastics decide to induct Cady into their small group. Shes not interested but at the urging of Janis and Damian she goes along with it so she can sew the seeds of dissention from within. Meanwhile Cady falls for tall dark and handsome Aaron (Jonathan Bennett) one of Reginas exes. This along with Cadys growing popularity around school creates friction within the plastics and eventually pits Cady against Regina. The ensuing battle includes numerous dirty tricks. Although it may not initially look like one this is at least to some degree a Saturday Night Live movie. Mean Girls was written by (and co-stars) Tina Fey who adapted the screenplay from Queen Bees and Wannabees by Rosalind Wiseman. SNL alum Anna Gasteyer has a part (as Cadys mom) and SNL creator Lorne Michaels owns a producer credit. The director is Mark S. Waters who brought Lindsay Lohan with him from Freaky Friday. This role represents something more edgy than the teen idol is used to; it may prove to be the stepping-stone she is looking for to introduce her to more sophisticated parts. Shes very good here developing Cady into a likable individual without losing the characters edge. It helps that Rachel McAdams (The Hot Chick) is in full-on bitch mode as her adversary Regina. Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried are also effective playing types. And in a supporting part as the schools principal Tim Meadows steals scenes with his perfect comic timing. I would have liked Mean Girls more if it had followed the Heathers/Election mold and not gone into compromise mode during the final fifteen minutes. Somewhere in the closing half-hour Mean Girls gives up on being a comedy and decides to morph into a traditional teen movie complete with a moral about the value of true friendship and the need to be oneself. The limp climax doesnt undo the solid humor wicked social commentary and delicious satire that precedes it but it leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. In the end Mean Girls isnt mean enough.
