They end the day by catching a movie that was then known as ""Return of the Jedi"" and debating it on the way home. One thing they can all agree on one of them observes (I think its super-psychic Jean Grey played by Sophie Turner) is that the third movie of a trilogy always sucks.Ha Thats kind of funny because see ... OK you get it. People around me at the New York press screening of ""X-Men Apocalypse"" which is the third film of Bryan Singers X-Men prequel trilogy chuckled a little but not all that enthusiastically. It wouldnt be quite fair to say that ""X-Men Apocalypse"" sucks. For deeply steeped Marvel Comics aficionados it will probably be fairly satisfying and theres no reason on earth why anyone else should even bother. Anyway I am determined to fend off the usual raft of comments announcing that I hate all comic-book movies along with chocolate ice cream small sticky dogs and all other forms of fun and that Salon is doing the world a disservice by not assigning someone who loves all comic-book movies indiscriminately to love them in pixellated prose for your enjoyment.So let me come out boldly and say no I didnt hate this movie. Its just kind of minor and miscellaneous with a cluttered cast of random and largely unfamiliar minor X-men and affiliated characters (OK not unfamiliar to you maybe) and Oscar Isaac wasted in the role of an invulnerable ancient supervillain who becomes vulnerable just in time for the final showdown. (Like Trump No I promise I wont make this review about the election or not much anyway.) Its basically a closing chapter to a feeble trilogy that started out pretty well and then ran out of gas and now must serve as a prequel to shadowy X-related endeavors yet to come.Wait that sounds like Im saying it kind of sucks. Lets back that up This movie doesnt suck all that much and Brutus is an honorable man. If we can rate this years big summer popcorn tentpole pictures so far (noting with exhaustion that it wont actually be summer for three more weeks) ""X-Men Apocalypse"" does not have the proto-fascist pretentiousness of ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" and while its a lot less ambitious its also far more agreeable. Its nowhere near as vigorous or as disturbing as ""Captain America Civil War"" which pretty much sets the 2016 cotton-candy gold standard for Movies That Go Boom especially in a year with no known Michael Bay works on the near horizon. (Bay keeps on promising that hes done with the ""Transformers"" franchise and keeps allowing himself to be sucked back in for more. Its his own kind of integrity.)There are some bits and pieces in ""X-Men Apocalypse"" that are genuinely terrific and show off Singers gift for dense plotting and character development. If youve been following this series -- and as I say there is zero reason to see this movie if you havent -- you know that Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto the mutant Auschwitz survivor played by Ian McKellen in the original ""X-Men"" franchise keeps switching from good to evil and back again like a quantum particle of superhero-ness. Now played by the ever-excellent Michael Fassbender Erik is in hiding a decade after his failed attempt to conquer the world in 1973 living a somewhat normal life as a steelworker in Communist-ruled Poland. There are way too many settings early in this movie Cairo Berlin Westchester a suburban American high school that looks more 1963 than 83. But the dark Polish saga of dread and death that flips Eriks switch back to the ""Exterminate all the brutes"" setting really sticks out. Its like a miniature Andrzej Wajda film stuck in the middle of a Marvel Comics summer movie. (And if you actually understand that reference why the hell are you reading this?) You Might Also Like There are somewhat valid storytelling reasons why Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg dont just spin out the tale of Magnetos struggle but most of the other stories simply cant compete. Theyre just methods by and large of introducing us to new characters and reintroducing us to old ones which is one of the main reasons why hardcore fans will probably enjoy this movie pretty well and other people will be all like ""Why am I supposed to care?"" At one point the screening audience started clapping for a new arrival when all we could see of him was his bare feet. So we meet the lizard-like guy who can vanish and rematerialize Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) a normal American teen who has high-voltage beams shooting out of his eyes and Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who lives in his moms basement but can stop time and move at the speed of light or some Einsteinian approximation thereof.That stuff is all moderately entertaining and both Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven and/or Mystique) and James McAvoy (as Xavier) are back in somewhat limited roles. Rose Byrnes character FBI agent Moira MacTaggert has forgotten her previous connection to Xavier and the X-Men -- and guess what so had I Even the flashback scenes from ""X-Men First Class"" didnt help much except by reminding me that that movie overstuffed as it was was a lot less boring than this one. Theres some guy with metallic angel wings (Ben Hardy) and a faintly kinky dominatrix-type with an electronic whip (Olivia Munn) and plenty more besides. But the real problem with ""Apocalypse"" is less the laundry list of characters than the dull gray vacuum in its center in the form of the evil entity played by Isaac who was apparently ancient and deeply tedious by the time of the ancient Egyptians. I understand that theres some deep X-Men lore at work in the legend of En Sabah Nur first of the mutants but at least in this screen telling it simply doesnt work. Some enterprising dudes from the Pharaohs palace guard succeed in walling him up inside one of the pyramids for a few thousand years so hes obviously not as all-powerful as he thinks. Once His Leathery Eminence wakes up (thanks to what looks like a giant circuit board left behind by aliens) and starts entombing people alive in walls or floors or any other surface available the Baked Enchilada briefly seems like he might make a truly terrifying villain. But as good as Oscar Isaac is he never identifies a character here because like most of those guys the Hungry Desert Popsicle is all big talk and angry bluster and a super-obvious blind spot We will disarm these paltry humans and wipe away their so-called civilization mwoo-ha-ha-ha Whoops except for the part I forgot about.So he is kind of like Trump then except honestly not as scary.

The group must battle villain Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) an Egyptian god.

Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Mutants galore infest ""X-Men Apocalypse"" but the pile-on quickly becomes wearying. Bryan Singers latest installment in the Twentieth Century Fox franchise is chockablock with the old standbys - even Hugh Jackmans Wolverine makes an uncredited appearance - but the storyline such as it is would have benefited from major pruning. It seems that Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) an Egyptian god newly awakened after 5300 years in slumberland wants to wipe away the world and all its awfulness and start afresh. This god definitely has a God complex.With supermutant powers beyond the paltry abilities of his X-Men combatants he proceeds to wreak havoc. He does however teleport all the worlds nuclear missiles into outer space out of harms way so you have to give him that. Recommended Superhero movies How well do you know them? Hes aided by some handpicked mutant recruits not that he needs help. Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is his biggest catch. In a particularly distasteful scene Apocalpyse brings Magneto to Auschwitz to seethe over the hellhole that wiped out his parents. Using Auschwitz as pulp fodder is remarkably clueless. Test your knowledge Superhero movies How well do you know them? Monitor Movie Guide Some of the franchise stalwarts such as Jennifer Lawrences Mystique are given too little to do.

Instead of Ewoks this movie has Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac sadly buried under makeup costuming and voice effects) the first mutant roused from a lengthy nap beneath the pyramids and eager to make up for lost time. He wants to destroy weak humanity and everything it has made and he wants his fellow mutants to help out. That much is clear. Whats much less clear is why a humanity-free world would be any better or even desirable -- you gotta rule somebody no? Or why he can turn most people into dust with but a thought but cant seem to do it to his adversaries. Etc. Its a shame this installment brings in some interesting new blood with teleporting blue devil Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and troubled telepath Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). (For once the baddies including weather-witch Storm (Alexandra Shipp) and psychic-swordster Psyclocke (Olivia Munn) are the more boring bunch.) Then it turns them into gears in the Big Final Fight Machine. Familial drama and big special effects come via fast-guy Quicksilver (Evan Peters) and metal-mover Magneto (Michael Fassbender). But without a compelling villain its hard to resist feeling like its just more of the (mutated) same. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona This movie is not currently in theaters.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 26 2016 132PM EDT Last updated Thursday May 26 2016 148PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Bryan Singer Written by Simon Kinberg Starring James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Lawrence Classification PG Genre action Year 2016 Country USA Language English Even in a movie season known for its abundance of overconfidence Bryan Singers X-Men Apocalypse arrives with an impressively cocky attitude.First the film has one character randomly decry Return of the Jedi because ""everyone knows the third movie is always the worst"" - a knowing wink to those who loathed X-Men The Last Stand the franchises third film and one of two X-movies to be made by someone not named Bryan Singer. Second it hired The Force Awakenss sex bomb Oscar Isaac owner of the worlds most charismatic smile but only so it could bury the actor underneath layers of grim blue makeup. And finally studio Twentieth Century Fox lifted the embargo on X-Men Apocalypse reviews almost a full month before its release a strangely long lead time when it comes to such fussed-over tentpoles. Brash execs must have assumed the new film was so amazing that theyd be drowned by a wave of positive press perhaps enough to rival the films chief comic-book competitor the universally loved Captain America Civil War. Mystique is back Jennifer Lawrence talks X-Men Apocalypse (AP Video) Well just like Icarus - or perhaps the X-universes own winged braggart Angel - Apocalypse has flown too close to the sun. Singers fourth X-Men film wants to be clever it wants to make a moral statement and it wants to be the most epic X-movie ever. Instead its a goofy confusing mess of a sequel a cautionary tale of what happens when a filmmaker lives too long inside his own franchise to realize that no one takes it nearly as seriously as he does.Simply trying to summarize the plot of Apocalypse takes the strength of Colossus (the mutant if not the Rhodes statue) as Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg zigzag across the globe to catch up with characters both known (Magneto Professor X Mystique) unknown (Isaacs ancient titular blue baddie the worlds first mutant) and rebooted (new versions of Jean Grey Cyclops Nightcrawler and Storm). They all end up smashing against each other in Egypt with the usual high stakes (the world itself) and higher levels of camp (God that skin-tight purple outfit Olivia Munn is forced to wear as Psylocke).And dont think that having watched any of the previous X-films will help you figure things out. By this point in the series - after the time-travel shenanigans in the fourth film wiped out the plot from the third and the second standalone Wolverine movie ignored events of the first - there is not so much a cohesive narrative structure to Singers universe as there is a madcap choose-your-own continuity misadventure. Comic fans will be mystified. Movie fans will be confused. Everyone will leave disappointed.Still X-Men Apocalypse cannot be written off as a complete waste of time (and talent and millions upon millions of dollars). What other blockbuster for instance can boast a CGI-enhanced destruction of Auschwitz? Thats where Holocaust survivor Magneto (a pained Michael Fassbender doing lots with little) is transported by the films dopey villain and urged to rip apart the infamous site from the ground up. Its a stunningly tasteless exploitation of an unspeakable tragedy but also a unique moment of poor judgment that must be seen to be believed.Couple that bewildering scene with a wealth of similarly bad-but-fascinating choices - lets have Rose Byrnes character remember nothing from her previous outing Lets set the film in the eighties for no real aesthetic or narrative purpose Oh and heres a cameo that retroactively cancels the ending of X-Men Days of Future Past - and Singers film becomes nothing less than a stunning act of cinematic hubris.Toward the end of the movie Apocalypse bellows to his fellow mutants-in-arms ""Everything theyve built will fall And from the ashes of their world well build a better one"" Naturally it doesnt work out that way. But its also just that kind of overconfidence that Singer himself should have recognized while making the film. Relax take it easy - its not the end of the world.

How many more times can you watch a bunch of too-good-for-this actors suit up to save the world?""X-Men Apocalypse"" is particularly egregious in this category casting Jennifer Lawrence Oscar Isaac and Michael Fassbender in the latest entry in this time-bending series that is in the slow process of rebooting itself (and making up its own rules regarding continuity as it goes). A cast with that level of talent -- Rose Byrne and James McAvoy too -- belongs in a prestige fall drama not in some second-rate superhero claptrap.But here they are in various levels of engagement (Lawrence who has hinted this may be her final ""X-Men"" movie already seems checked out) ushering the ""X-Men"" story through the 80s. Isaac unrecognizable underneath several layers of makeup is Apocalypse the worlds first mutant whose reign of terror dates back to 3600 B.C. and who wakes up from a long nap ready to destroy the universe.The X-Men assemble though it takes some time to get them all on the same page and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) shows up for about 45 seconds to fulfill his contractual obligations. Thats what ""X-Men Apocalypse"" is a contract fulfillment. Theres no spark and everyone lumbers through the motions.

Director Bryan Singer who started the whole thing in high style with 2000s X-Men returns for a fourth time. Singer shows a lot of energy but he and screenwriter Simon Kinberg (Fantastic Four yuck) let the movie get way overcrowded. Besides the above-mentioned returnees including Beast (Nicholas Hoult) whos teaching at the professors school theres the students. Say hello to Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) Jean Grey (Game of Thrones Sophie Turner) Quicksilver (Evan Peters) and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan). And just when were getting into watching the kids try to control their powers come other arrivals. On the dark side theres Storm (Alexandra Shipp) Angel (Ben Hardy) and the admittedly cool Psylocke (Oliva Munn). Theres even a cameo from Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) because well Wolfie is kind of the franchise mascot. And CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) is back this time with amnesia. Enough already. Singer throws so much at us that nothing sticks. I was almost rooting for Trump to impose a quota. The saving grace is Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) the villain named in the films title. Isaac is such a focused centered actor that he eradicates the FX noise around him. A prologue reveals the rebirth of Apocalypse in ancient Egypt. The baddie is now intent on kidnapping Professor X so he can absorb his powers and mindfuck the planet. Even covered in makeup and headgear Isaac -- like Tom Hardy in The Dark Knight Rises -- shows what a virtuoso actor can do with his hands metaphorically tied behind his back. Hes the life of the party. Everyones favorite mutants are back for the latest installment of the superhero franchise X-Men Apocalypse. Watch here.

But compared to the sleek and often thrilling X-Men Days of Future Past (2014) the movie seems dull and bloated.

Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Twentieth Century Fox They promise us thats Oscar Isaac under there playing Apocalypse in X-Men Apocalypse. Twentieth Century Fox X-Men Apocalypse the sixth X-movie in 16 years (give or take a couple of Wolverine solo flicks and the breakout spinoff Deadpool) begins and ends with wearying campaigns of computer-animated mayhem. Pyramids then skyscrapers dissolve. The body count must be high but the stakes feel low. Bummer. Because the 85 minutes in between those dreary poles? Amusing enough and true to the clunky hyperbolic spirit of The Uncanny X-Men comics circa 1983 when this entry is set. The signposts are obvious (teleporting X-Man Nightcrawler spends most of the movie in Michael Jacksons red leather jacket from the ""Thriller"" video) and less so (a cameo by WarGames star Ally Sheedy). Here is a movie that gets the details right while getting the big stuff -- pacing emotional investment dialogue -- largely wrong. Its not the first deflating X-Men picture but its the first from director Bryan Singer who now has four of these under his belt including the original. I miss the thrifty midnight-movie quality that initial colon-free X-Men had. Its competitors at the Y2K summer box office were Gladiator The Patriot What Lies Beneath The Perfect Storm -- the kinds of splashy star vehicles that superhero films have all but displaced. X-Men was cheaper and weirder (and not for nothing shorter) than its peers. It couldnt afford the kind of digital city-stomping thats become the genres least appealing trope. Like the first Men in Black (another comic book adaptation) it was an expensive movie that still felt low-rent in the best possible way. Even Hugh Jackman the one player who has X-Men to thank for his film career was a replacement for an actor who dropped out. Thats how rickety it was. In 2011s X-Men First Class Marvels Strangest Super-Heroes of All (sic) defused the Cuban Missile Crisis while JFK took the credit and so the X-flicks were reborn as period films. Ironically pulling these characters back in time was just the trick to make the aging franchise feel fresh. 2014s Days of Future Past restored Singer to the helm for a era-straddling willfully continuity-scrambling romp that mostly took place in 1973. Apocalypse suggests the DeLorean may at last run out of plutonium despite the fizz Singer amp; Co. wring from its Reagan-era setting. Thats when the long-slumbering Egyptian proto-mutant En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac though his giant blue banana costume makes him tough to pick out) awakens determined to gather a mutant flock to cleanse the planet of homo sapien vermin. ""From the ashes of their world well build a better one"" he declares several times. Heckuva campaign slogan guy. Its intimated he may have inspired some of the Bibles gnarlier chapters so hes unburdened by the pursuit of ""relatability"" that confounds so many leaders now. Like every X-Men adventure Apocalypse is superficially about how far its moderate assimilationist heroes -- organized by benign telepath Prof. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) -- are willing to go to stop their more militant brethren from declaring war on their human oppressors. The series grand subject has always been the politics of alienation v. inclusion though this installment expresses that idea via the clumsiest of its available tools Words. A decade of story-time has passed since the X-Men movie of just two summers ago and Singer amp; Co. spend nearly the whole film putting the band back together. Tye Sheridan Sophie Turner Alexandra Shipp and Kodi Smit-McPhee make their debuts as the younger versions of Scott ""Cyclops"" Summers Jean ""Marvel Girl"" Grey Ororo ""Storm"" Munroe and Kurt ""Nightcrawler"" Wagner. Only McPhee evinces much personality playing the X-Man who least resembles a person. (Like a lot of characters in this series Nightcrawler has blue skin. And a tail.) When he meet him hes being forced to fight the winged mutant Angel for the amusement of his captors in some unholy German circus. Meanwhile Michael Fassbenders Erik ""Magneto"" Lensherr has become a family man living quietly in Poland under an alias after levitating a stadium on global television in the last movie. We know his idyll must be doomed but the scene where it all goes south on him is still the films most affecting one. Jennifer Lawrence is now much more famous than she was when she signed her multi-picture deal; her screen time as the conflicted shapeshifter Mystique has been beefed up to reflect her increased stature. Mystique has become a folk hero among mutants and shes the true believer who whips this lineup of greenhorn X-Men into a fighting unit. Because even casual fans know by now that Magneto and Mystique are destined to rebuff Xaviers entreaties and become violent separatists their ethical struggles here should resonate more than they do. Will it bother you that Fassbender McAvoy Lawrence Nicholas Hoult and Rose Byrne have aged only five years since First Class which was set more than 20 years before this film? A Not as much as the fact that Oscar ""Poe Llewyn Dameron Davis"" Isaacs face and voice are both buried though his eyelids remain recognizable somehow. (Good luck mining anything he does in this movie for a hilarious GIF.) As his evil henchwoman Psylocke a near-silent Olivia Munn sports a purple dominatrix getup thats both true to the comics and laughably unsuited to combat but at least she looks cool. The cinematography is by Singers usual cameraman Newton Thomas Sigel who also shot the similarly 80s-fixated thriller Drive. Here he manages a breathtaking otherworldly tableau just often enough to underline the movies stasis. Even at two-and-a-half hours -- a serving-size that has become as inflexible for superhero movies as 22 pages once was for single-issue comic books -- Apocalypse barely shifts out of setup mode. Thats peculiar problem for a sixth installment that also seems to be intended as a second trilogy-capper to have. But then deja vu abounds Apocalypses best bit is a reprise of superfast mutant Quicksilvers (Evan Peters) lightspeed routine from the prior movie. Again the gag is set to a period-appropriate pop song but its not as canny a selection as before. This pervasive sense of ""more of the same but less"" wouldnt be nearly so disheartening coming from a filmmaker whose career began with less promise than Singers. He made his name with 1995s The Usual Suspects a crime picture that was unique enough to spawn a cottage industry of parodies. Hes worked steadily on a variety of material since but still Four of these now. Theres nothing cheap or weird or Heaven forfend short about an X-Men movie anymore. Hes just going where the work is.

Credit 20th Century Fox Film Corporation ""Mutants are born with extraordinary abilities"" James McAvoy says as this movie begins in darkness. He pronounces ""extraordinary"" in the same plummy way that British actors have been doing since oh ""Lawrence of Arabia"" at least. The darkness gives way to the largely C.G.I.-generated landscape of ""Egypt 3600 B.C."" Inside a pyramid a peculiar ritual is taking place. Stone-faced royals and functionaries partaking in it sport jewelry makeup and scars that once again inspire a viewer to ponder why contemporary Hollywood insistently looks to Burning Man to inform its vision of the ancient world.

Watch in Times Video >> embed The ritual involves transportation of souls and is accompanied by the glowing and throbbing of what looks like large-scale electronic circuitry embedded in the pyramids interiors. Mutant business we are meant to infer existed well before the X-Men.The bombast of the opening sequence -- which ends with the pyramid sabotaged into collapse obliging the movies eventual mutant villain to cool his heels for about five millenniums -- leaves no doubt that the viewer is in for more of the superhero same old same old. Directed by Bryan Singer ""X-Men Apocalypse"" the ninth film in the X-Men franchise indeed hews hard to all the genre verities. Including as its title more than implies an end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it threat. Photo Michael Fassbender as Magneto in ""X-Men Apocalypse"" the ninth film in the X-Men franchise. Credit 20th Century Fox Film Corporation The sequel to ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" which was a mutant-origins time-travel saga ""Apocalypse"" begins -- after beginning in ancient Egypt that is -- in 1983 10 years after most of the events of ""Past."" Those had resulted in an uneasy detente between boring regular humanity and the superpowered mutants who walked among them.Much of the first hour is devoted to getting-the-band-back-together mechanics which also lets the scenarists -- Mr. Singer Michael Dougherty Dan Harris and Simon Kinberg -- give the characters some new emotional scars. Michael Fassbenders Magneto for instance has found peaceful anonymity in Poland and has started a family. As adepts know however Magneto is destined for major supervillainy and in the logic of supervillain character development a mere tragic separation from ones family just doesnt cut it. Photo Jennifer Lawrence returns in ""X-Men Apocalypse."" Credit 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Because Mr. Singer has the technical chops to be a near-distinctive filmmaker (remember ""The Usual Suspects""?) his X-Men movies have always delivered what could be called a higher class of superhero entertainment. It is no accident that no character in this movie appears wearing a costume until nearly a whole hour has passed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Its also pertinent that the X-Men movies have always been anchored by great actors. In the early ones the roles of rival frenemy mutants Dr. Charles Xavier (he of the ""live and let live"" school regarding ordinary humans) and Magneto (of the ""take care of them before they wipe us out"" school) were played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Mr. McAvoy as the younger Xavier and Mr. Fassbender as Magneto are in their way just as convincing and this film also of course boasts Jennifer Lawrence as the morphable mutant called either Raven or Mystique depending on whos doing the calling. Photo From left Jennifer Lawrence Rose Byrne James McAvoy Lucas Till and Nicholas Hoult in ""X-Men Apocalypse."" Credit Alan Markfield/20th Century Fox Film Corporation As for the potential bringer of apocalypse En Sabah Nur is played by Oscar Isaac who fares poorly through no fault of his own. Buried under makeup that leaves him looking like a renegade member of Blue Man Group he has no chance to display the charisma that made him such a vital component of ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" last year. Perhaps as a sort of private joke he delivers many of his lines in the same kind of portent-laden stage whisper that Marlon Brando used as Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now.""After laying waste to what looks like a deserted Cairo (En Sabah Nur has a real problem with post-Bronze Age architecture) the mutant villain and his handpicked four horsemen (dont look at me that reference is in the script) face off against Xavier and varied seasoned and unseasoned good mutants. The battle is more interesting for being played out on fields both physical and psychic. The wit of the moviemakers is displayed effectively here and even more so in a rescue sequence showcasing the impossibly fast moves of the young Quicksilver. Video Movie Review X-Men Apocalypse The Times critic Glenn Kenny reviews ""X-Men Apocalypse"" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER on Publish Date May 26 2016. Photo by Twentieth Century Fox/Twentieth Century Fox via Associated Press. But for every lively moment theres a reminder that the franchise is tiring. The genres emphasis on potential mass death is obsessive and unimaginative. At one point in ""Apocalypse"" En Sabah Nur takes Magneto on a visit to Auschwitz where Mr. Singer placed that characters back story in ""X-Men"" (2000) the first film in the series. This narrative element seemed in extremely questionable taste at the time although Mr. Singer presented it in a way that could also be seen as laudably ambitious. In this movie the use of Auschwitz feels utterly cavalier.""X-Men Apocalypse"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and apocalypse. Running time 2 hours 23 minutes.

The previous episode ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" was as fresh and enjoyable as this one is semicoherent and dispiriting and both films were directed by Bryan Singer from screenplays written by Simon Kinberg.

""The world is broken"" he said. ""Well"" I replied ""then lets pick someone who knows how to fix it."" ""Nah"" he sighed. ""Time to burn it all down."" We sat in the darkness of the theater and our conversation continued without us. There was Michael Fassbenders Magneto wanting to blow civilization to hell -- three films in since X-Men First Class the concentration camp survivors anger has become quiet resolution; hes less shouty and more scary. There was bureaucrat Professor X (James McAvoy) struggling to sway him with the idea that small steps -- one more new student one more civil CIA interaction -- make big strides. And there was Jennifer Lawrences Mystique on an inspirational poster blue chin tilted like Obama giving people hope. All comic book stories have political shadows. The difference is how much theyre lit bright and blown out like The Avengers which hammers jokes onto one thesis or dark and subconscious like Batman where real fears become bogeymen. But this latest X-Men series doesnt take place in a parallel world; it takes places in ours and its heroes and antiheroes dont fight symbols -- they battle the truth. In the first two films Magneto was accused of trying to assassinate JFK and Nixon. Here in 1983 with Reagans little smile hanging everywhere like the Mona Lisa he flattens Auschwitz. Yet while Apocalypse sounds like this weeks election think piece the Bernie/Hillary allusions are coincidental -- or really foreordained. The disgruntled have wanted to destroy the system since Noah boarded his ark. Thats almost as old as Apocalypse villain En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac not that youd know it under his gooey makeup and peeled-grape eyeballs) an immortal mutant whos been stockpiling powers for millennia like an angry squirrel. As the film hints he may have even invented the idea of God a concept that in its extreme form continues to get people killed. So it makes us shudder when director Bryan Singer awakens him in Egypt site of some of todays bitterest struggles and flanks him with devotees eager to help him behead and bomb whomever he deems morally corrupt. If Magneto who has legitimate grievances is Bernie En Sabah Nur is Trump Hes always been on top yet he still wants the world ""cleansed"" a decision hes made just from skimming scraps of infotainment on TV. Sucking data from a set he flicks through channels and speaks his first English words ""Learning"" he stutters. And then ""Weapons."" Apocalypse is bone-crackingly violent. People are bent into pretzels burned smashed and slashed across the jugular with everything from lockets to sand. Singer has one favorite camera move -- a breakneck wormhole zoom -- which he finds an excuse to use three times. Otherwise he doesnt seem to have any idea what to do with the lens. He sort of plops it wherever as though hes worried his actors will collapse under the weight of their costumes and greasepaint. Twentieth Century FoxAnd yet I found myself loving this strange straight-faced operetta that embraces everything from Gregorian chanting to East German punk to Flock of Seagulls. The year 1983 is a daffily perfect setting for a superhero flick somehow managing to feel both familiar and fresh Jean Gray (Sophie Turner) is in mom jeans Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) sports a red Thriller jacket Professor X favors feathered Hall and Oates hair and lavender V-neck sweaters and Quicksilver (Evan Peters once again stealing every scene) wears of course a Rush T-shirt. Though Lawrences numb eyes plead to escape yet another franchise we at least get a kick out of her video-vixen wardrobe of metallic dresses slashed to her ribs. Give her a guitar and shell be the Lita Ford of early MTV. Fassbender however remains totally committed to the series -- speech for speech hes a better sad tyrant as Magneto than he was in last years Macbeth. Of the new kids Tye Sheridan is an expressive 16-year-old Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops a feat given that he has to spend most of the film hiding his eyes. (Thank god for his vulnerable quivering mouth.) Turners Jean Grey has the sensibleness of a Jane Austen heroine. Thanks to their CGI powers she and Sheridan have to spend big action scenes er staring intensely at stuff. They manage not to giggle which is its own super stunt. The catch is aging down Summers and Grey back to high schoolers makes their love triangle with Wolverine bizarre They get younger but Hugh Jackman stays the same age. In Apocalypse he cameos just to skewer three dozen men and let the young girl inhale his musk. She blinks at him with fear and awe and just a spark of heat -- she wouldnt know what to do with the hairy manimal if she caught him. For now she needs a boy who could pose with balloons in Teen Beat. As for their enemies all newbie zealots under the sway of En Sabah Nurs revolution Ben Hardys Angel and Alexandra Shipps Storm get one good scene each. We want more. Theres just no room. But at least they fare better than Olivia Munns Psylocke who must have been given only two directions stand with your legs so far apart it doesnt make sense and glare at the camera. Hey you cant focus on everything when youre trying to tear down one world in order to build another. En Sabah Nur doesnt even seem to know how he wants it rebuilt. And so X-Men Apocalypse makes one more bridge to our present Its just much more fun to smash em up than to do the dull work of planning whats next.

In 2000 director Bryan Singer established the model for the modern super-team movie with ""X-Men"" followed by an even better sequel. Yet the weight of all that has transpired in between bogs down ""X-Men Apocalypse"" which yields good moments but juggles too many characters and callbacks to earlier movies. Its not that Marvels superhero parade has passed Singer by; rather the director and writer Simon Kinberg (penning his third ""X-Men"" film) have sacrificed some of the wit and fun associated with the franchise by aping the gigantism of ""The Avengers."" In addition the plot flits around so promiscuously even die-hard fans might need a scorecard to keep up. The villain Apocalypse played by Oscar Isaac is also uninspired. Rising to seek world conquest after lying dormant and entombed for thousands of years he feels too much like a rehash of world-imperiling threats seen elsewhere -- complete with a high disregard for human life and hellacious amount of property damage. Related Captain America Civil War battles to fifth biggest box office opening ever ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" partly dealt with events in 1973 and ""Apocalypse"" leaps ahead another decade. So while Professor Xavier and Magneto are again played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively (looking distractingly young given the passage of time) characters like Jean Grey (""Game of Thrones"" Sophie Turner) and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) are high-school kids meeting for the first time and wrestling with their developing powers. Dating back to the comics the ""X-Men"" have always excelled at capturing feelings of being an outcast as a youth. That sense of being different and seeking acceptance has taken on greater relevance as a gay-rights metaphor. Still this latest movie spends too much time setting up its showdown as Apocalypse enlists several mutants to his cause. Meanwhile Xavier initially resists turning his young proteges into warriors which proves merely an extended prologue to the inevitable battle royale. Related Spider-Man doing what he can to boost box office That fight chaotically plays out both physically and psychically. And while there are a few stirring visuals as various characters square off its not nearly as clever as ""Captain America Civil War"" while becoming mired in building-shattering effects that make ""Man of Steels"" carnage-filled climax seem positively restrained. Its become a given that fine actors now populate these franchises. The sprawling cast however leaves too many of them feeling wasted from Jennifer Lawrence to Olivia Munn the latter handling a way-cool glowing sword but precious little dialogue. Once again Evan Peters provides a dose of comic relief as the speedy Quicksilver although even that gag is essentially just a reprise from ""Days of Future Past."" Related Review Captain America Civil War sets standard for superhero team-ups Whats left then are plenty of references that evoke previous movies from Jean Greys dark fate to a cameo that shouldnt be spoiled. But thats as much a triumph of logistics as anything else and almost a distraction for those trying to keep track if everything really holds together within the ""X-Men"" timeline. Those who have seen the previous ""X-Men"" movies will likely feel motivated to keep their run complete and over 2 hours and 23 minutes they mostly get their moneys worth. But nor will anyone miss much by waiting to catch this prequel on cable or another secondary platform as opposed to rushing out to see ""Apocalypse"" now.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox. MOVIE REVIEW X-MEN APOCALYPSE 143 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence language). Meet the latest supervillain Hes an ancient power-hungry being whos declared that the world needs to be destroyed. And saved. And cleansed. Make up your mind dude There is very little to distinguish En Sabah Nur (Oscar Isaac) from all of the other baddies in all of the other comic book movies. This is especially depressing in a franchise that at its core is all about celebrating differences. But ""X-Men Apocalypse"" the third installation in the series reboot gets in the first word about its own shortcomings ""At least we can all agree the third one is always the worst"" says Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) as a gang of X-youths leave a showing of ""Return of the Jedi."" Yes this ones set in the 80s a decade after the last film ""Days of Future Past."" Just catching up with the whole mutant gang takes a good chunk of time but its the most entertaining this overlong movies going to get so enjoy it while it lasts. Heres Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) old laser eyes himself using his newfound powers on a bully then enrolling at Xaviers school and flirting with Jean his future spouse. Heres Eric Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) living a normal life with a wife and daughter and working as . . . a welder? Youd think the guy might have gone with woodworking but no. James McAvoy as telepathic leader Professor Charles Xavier radiates charm as always but hes hamstrung by a screenplay that relies more on CGI than dialogue. The issue at hand A terrifying Egyptian mutant (Isaac) has awoken from millennia of slumber under pyramid ruins (apparently it doesnt take much to bring them down; a BC-set preface sees renegades yanking out a couple columns and bringing the whole place down) with designs on world domination. Among En Sabah Nurs new flunkies are Storm (Alexandra Shipp) who never gets to stir up really any weather at all and Psylocke (Olivia Munn) whose main power seems to be her magic purple whip. Both are tricked out like dominatrixes while their male counterparts wear actual protective armor. Meanwhile Magnetos having a breakdown after having been brutally outed as a mutant and Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence soldiering through yet another past its prime series) is determined to get to him before he breaks bad as he does in every single ""X-Men"" movie. Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira Mactaggert and Nicholas Hoult as Hank ""Beast"" McCoy have little to do other than be resourceful. Director Bryan Singer gets in a few satisfying set pieces including speed demon Quicksilver (Evan Peters) lackadaisically rescuing students from a fiery explosion and a feral Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) making a memorable entrance. Mostly though its the same old story Bad mutants versus good mutants with the fate of us humans -- mostly off-screen disturbingly expendable -- hanging in the balance.

If they were all in the same skies at the same time wed have the costumed equivalent of 530 p.m. rush hour on the outbound Eisenhower. As it is the 2016 superhero slate is all about the All-Star matchups. Batman took on Superman the Avengers split up for a nasty intramural skirmish that included even more new characters -- and now the X-Men are back on the big screen for a sequel/prequel/stand-alone adventure featuring at least eight characters with dual identities giving these lucky actors IMDB resume credits such as ""Scott Summers/Cyclops"" ""Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver"" and of course ""Hank McCoy/Beast."" And the invaluable Oscar Isaac as ""En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse"" SWEET However this is a decidedly mixed bag just barely meriting a recommendation. Some 16 years after the original ""X-Men"" helped usher in the new and greatly improved era of superhero movies ""X-Men Apocalypse"" breaks no fresh ground and veers in so many directions I could have used a handy reference guide with categories such as ""Familiar Characters From Previous Films Now Played by Younger Actors"" ""Introduction of Some New Characters"" and the all-important ""Why So Many Comic Book Villains Want to Destroy the World When It Seems Like It Would be More Fun to RULE the World."" This isnt A-level ""X-Men"" but its a visual feast it doesnt take itself too seriously its brimming with stellar performances it has some legitimately moving teamwork segments -- and it contains perhaps my favorite scene of any movie this year. (More on that in a moment.) ""Apocalypse"" is set in 1983 some 10 years after the events of ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" (Before we get to the 1980s we have to endure yet another action movie prologue set in ancient Egypt. Boy oh boy was ancient Egypt a busy place) Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender in a superb performance) is living in Poland under an assumed name laboring as an ironworker in what appears to be the most unsafe factory in the world and coming home each night to his loving wife and adoring daughter. For the tormented Erik its as close to paradise as hell ever come -- as long as nobody finds out hes a mutant. Its hardly a spoiler alert to reveal Erik does not spend the entire movie reading bedtime stories to his little girl. What IS surprising is the quietly powerful and even realistic tone of this story line. It could have made for a fine short film on its own. An unrecognizable Oscar Isaac is Apocalypse who awakens from the slumber of many thousand years and is appalled by the corrupt hedonistic state of the world. Apocalypse goes on a recruiting trip lining up the Four Horseman (as in ""The Four Horseman of..."") who will help him destroy the world and remake it in his own image or some such thing. Sounds like a real treat of a world. Meanwhile back at Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters in beautiful Westchester County N.Y. (can you imagine the tuition if one didnt get a full scholarship?) Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy excellent once again in the role) mentors a class that includes young Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) who has yet to learn how to control the deadly beams that shoot from his eyes and the telepathic Jean Grey (Sophie Turner from ""Game of Thrones""). Those two are starting to develop a thing for one another. Talk about sparks flying. The signature scene in ""Apocalypse"" As an explosion rocks Xaviers school Quicksilver (Evan Peters) uses his super-duper-duper-duper speed to save dozens of students all to the tune of ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" by the Eurythmics. Its a beautiful funny exciting altogether magical sequence -- as entertaining as anything Ive seen at the movies in a long time. Directed by ""X-Men"" stalwart Bryan Singer ""Apocalypse"" pops onscreen and has more dramatic reach than many a superhero movie from Professor Xs bittersweet reunion with CIA operative Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) whose memories of their earlier time together have been wiped clean to the young Storm (Alexandre Shipp) reassessing her loyalties to that ever-complex relationship between the professor and Magneto. Oddly enough the worst performance in the film comes from Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence who alternately barks out her lines or delivers them in flat tones. Either shes bored playing this character or she simply misfired. Its not good. After the recent releases of ""Deadpool"" ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Captain America Civil War"" the timing isnt the best for ""X-Men Apocalypse."" Even the hardcore geeks who like to get their Comic-Con on might be feeling a little superhero fatigue right about now. Still. You owe it to yourself to see Quicksilver do his thing.  20th Century Fox presents a film directed by Bryan Singer and written by Simon Kinberg. Running time 135 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of violence action and destruction brief strong language and some suggestive images). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac in grayish blue makeup) has judged the world and found it lacking. And as the worlds first mutant with powers beyond measure hes capable of bringing this thing we call existence to an end.So its a bit puzzling that instead of just getting on with it he decides to recruit four mutant underlings whose help he doesnt really seem to need the stormy Ororo (Alexandra Shipp) the winged Angel (Ben Hardy) the formidable Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and the conflicted Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Its not long before the mayhem they generate comes to the attention of Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) -- leader of the X-Men advocate for peaceful relations between humans and mutants and sometime ally of Magneto whose take on humanity is significantly less charitable.Among the other mutants in the mix are the shapeshifting Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) whose sympathies lean toward Magneto but whom Xavier can usually count on in a pinch; the brainy Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) aka the brawny Beast; and the telekinetic Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) whos even more conflicted than Magneto.Together the X-Men have what it takes to stop Apocalypse. But is time on their side?Set in the 1980s""X-Men Apocalypse"" -- the latest offering in the long-running superhero franchise -- is intermittently thrilling but mostly exhausting. Even by comic-book movie standards theres an emptiness to the proceedings that could motivate some folks to seek out the nearest art film. Working from a screenplay by Simon Kinberg director Bryan Singer -- who helmed ""X-Men"" (2000) and two of its previous sequels -- keeps things moving but has too many things to move. And the computer-generated imagery comes across as cheap and cheesy particularly compared to similar work in ""Captain America Civil War.""McAvoy and Fassbender appealingly reprise their frenemy chemistry. But Lawrence has little to do but look perplexed.""X-Men Apocalypse"" isnt a catastrophe but you may find it lacking.What ""X-Men Apocalypse""  Two stars out of four  Run time 220  Rating PG-13  Content Violence destruction language suggestive images Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com More information For movies venture beyond the multiplex this summer Summer offers lots of opportunities to see movies -- and not just in the multiplexes.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan May 26 Bryan Singers ""X-Men Apocalypse"" opens this week. (20th Century Fox) X -Men Apocalypse"" is a veritable pinata of mutants a picturesque eruption of the world as we know it -- or at least as comic book fans do -- scattering trails of smoke rubble dead bodies and genetically enhanced superheroes every which way. With a main cast of 20 including four unnamed mutants who are quickly dispatched during a prologue in ancient Egypt the latest sequel in the beloved Marvel Comics movie saga about freaks of nature is even by todays bloated standards of the genre a bit overstuffed. Its as if ""Captain America Civil War"" ate ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" swallowing everything except the most indigestible bits of social commentary. At times ""Apocalypse"" can be great fun even if it doesnt know when to hand its car keys to a friend and ask to be taken home. The super-destructive film boasts some eye-popping special effects a cameo appearance by a beloved character and even a bit of self-deprecating humor at the expense of ""X-Men The Last Stand"" which is widely held to be the worst film of the original trilogy. But its also about 20 minutes too long -- and 10 characters too large. [Summer Movie Guide Reboots mutants sequels and more] The party gets underway after that opening prologue with the resurrection of the titular Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) a superannuated mother-of-all-mutants who has been buried in the ruins of a pyramid since the 37th century B.C. Shaking off his cobwebs and emerging into the light of 1983 -- 10 years after the action of ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" -- the now understandably grouchy supervillain wastes no time replacing his dead acolytes known naturally as the Four Horsemen War Death Famine and Pestilence. Luckily for him the world is full of fresh recruits for his long-shelved plan dismantling the old world order in favor of a one overseen by mutants. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) the original and most powerful mutant embarks on a path of global destruction in ""X-Men Apocalypse."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Is that not what these things are always about? This time theres a vague whiff of the current zeitgeist of anti-establishment political fervor due more to an accident of timing no doubt than any prescience by director Bryan Singer reuniting with his ""Days of Future Past"" screenwriter Simon Kinberg. Eagerly stepping into the role of the Four Horsemen are characters who will be familiar from earlier installments of the franchise even if their allegiance is not as it has always been weather-controlling Storm (Alexandra Shipp); winged Angel (Ben Hardy); Psylocke (Olivia Munn) who has the ability to generate psychic weaponry; and Magneto (Michael Fassbender). Traditionally known as the seriess metal-controlling arch-villain Magneto has always wrestled with morality as a result of his parents deaths at Auschwitz. Here his somewhat grudging embrace of the dark side is precipitated by a second tragedy which takes place early in the film adding an unnecessary layer of psychological nuance to an already fraught character. On the other side of the battle line is the mentalist Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and a slew of his X-Men protegees most prominently shape-shifting Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence); feral Beast (Nicholas Hoult); lightning-fast Quicksilver (Evan Peters); Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) who shoots beams out of his eyes; and the telekinetic telepath Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). Professor X (James McAvoy seated) and his students -- from left Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) Alex Summers (Lukas Till) and Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) -- face a new supervillain in ""X-Men Apocalypse."" (Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox Film) Did I mention that there are a lot of characters? And that this is one of the most violent ""X-Men"" films yet? The brutality may be a mere warm-up for next years as-yet-untitled sequel about Wolverine which reportedly is courting an R rating. Ole Mutton Chops (Hugh Jackman) even makes an appearance here. It cant be called brief although it adds virtually nothing except five minutes to the film. [X-Men Apocalypse may be the worst-reviewed film in the franchise] As in ""Days of Future Past"" the film also contains a piece of special-effects wizardry involving Quicksilvers ability to move faster than the eye can perceive. Here however the protracted ""bullet time"" sequence comes across as pandering and overlong. Theres a lot for an ""X-Men"" fan to like about ""Apocalypse"" in addition to all the eye candy and familiar faces themes of tolerance and togetherness for example. (Not especially new but there you have it.) The difference between Good and Evil as Xavier articulates it is that the bad guy -- despite his Four Horsemen -- is alone whereas Xavier who has the ability to mind-meld with the entire world is not. Thats an inspiring pep talk. For this apocalyptic showdown however the coach could easily have benched a few players without affecting the outcome of the game. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence action and destruction brief strong language and some suggestive images. 140 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Professor X (James McAvoy) still has his hair at this point and is dreaming of a full campus to educate and train mutants. Another new arrival is Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) who shoots fire rays out of his eyes at a school bully which finally convinces him to let his brother Alex or Havok (Lucas Till) enroll him with Professor X.

(Photo Twentieth Century Fox)In case it hasnt sunk in there are far too many characters to keep up with in the movie. In fact theres far too much movie period -- clocking in at two hours and 24 minutes it takes a while to get through. Obviously a big showdown is brewing but it all seems familiar. So much so in fact that Quicksilver (Evan Peters) again gets to use his super speed in another set piece set to a pop song as the action slows down around him -- pretty much just like he did in the superior ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" (That said its still one of the more-entertaining scenes in the movie and Peters one of the more intriguing actors.)RELATED The big guide to summer moviesAnd once again Magneto will float in the air and do his Magneto thing looking exactly like he did in the last film.

Maybe this is just an off movie for him. Or maybe its just getting harder to come up with something truly exciting by now. This is after all another spoke in the franchise wheel one that keeps rolling along. It feels flat disjointed with too many moving parts. Slow things down maybe.

(Credit 20th Century Fox) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The mutant superheroes battle an ancient being who wants to destroy mankind.CAST James McAvoy Jennifer Lawrence Oscar Isaac Michael FassbenderRATED PG-13 Intense action some bloody violenceLENGTH 223BOTTOM LINE Dont believe the negative hype. Though sluggish and overlong the ninth film in the franchise has some entertaining moments. Superheroes are coming under fire these days sometimes from each other sometimes from their previously adoring public. Batman turned against Superman Iron Man turned against Captain America and now unexpectedly critics are turning against the X-Men. Early reviews of ""X-Men Apocalypse"" the ninth film in an otherwise well-regarded franchise have been not just negative but downright hostile. The movie has been called ""weightless"" ""lifeless"" ""a bloated snoozing bore."" What gives? Could any film starring Americas sweetheart Jennifer Lawrence and directed by the acclaimed Bryan Singer (now on his fourth ""X-Men"" installment) really be that bad? advertisement | advertise on newsday ""X-Men Apocalypse"" is definitely one of the series weakest entries but its far from a total disaster. Is it sluggish and overlong? Does it contain roughly 100 more characters than it needs? Does the roaring climax have the ring of the familiar? In other words Is this a superhero movie? The answer to all of the above is yes. That said ""X-Men Apocalypse"" written by series regular Simon Kinberg has a few things to recommend it. For starters the movies topical theme -- its always topical -- isnt alien invasion government overreach or the moral quandaries of fighting terrorism. This time the villain is an ancient Egyptian god nicknamed Apocalypse (an enjoyably condescending Oscar Isaac) who wakes up in the early 1980s and begins amassing followers to help him ""cleanse"" the Earth. Insane religious zealotry -- now theres an idea. Whats more nearly every mutant gets his or her moment. Michael Fassbenders Magneto goes mostly for pathos (how much personal loss can one guy suffer anyway?) but Sophie Turners Jean Grey makes a grand showing as does -- spoiler alert -- Hugh Jackmans Wolverine. As in 2014s ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" the fast-moving Quicksilver (Evan Peters) all but steals the show. James McAvoy is dependably elegant as the mutant guru Charles Xavier. Movies10 best superhero movies of all time Critics have generally regarded the ""X-Men"" films as superhero fare for the thinking man and its true that this movie isnt thinking too much. Maybe ""X-Men Apocalypse"" has fallen short of high expectations or maybe this forward-looking franchise is being outpaced by the Avengers. At any rate the spring of 2016 seems like an awfully late date to start complaining of superhero fatigue.

Photo Credit Alan Markfield. Photo Alan Markfield/TM/Marvel Its fascinating to see X Men Apocalypse get lambasted by critics who -- emboldened by fanboy cavils with Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice and perhaps a bit ashamed for wilting so uncritically before the juggernaut that was Captain America Civil War -- have finally announced that weve hit the group-superhero saturation point. Big news eh? Beating up on director Bryan Singer isnt especially risky either. Although not indicted for statutory rape he has been sullied by accounts of orgiastic pool parties and employees who spend much of their time supplying him with very young (though legal and consenting) sexual partners. Private behavior doesnt invalidate the noble ""It Gets Better"" subtext of the X-Men films but it does raise prurient thoughts about the seemingly wholesome goings-on behind the gates of Professor Xaviers mansion. I keeed. The point is that X-Men Apocalypse is ripe for the taking down. But I liked it a lot. The defense admits that its choppy and the effects are variable. But the charge of too many characters and subplots is unusually dull-witted even for our duller critical wits. Characters have always flitted -- or whooshed or roared -- in and out of X-Men movies. Whereas Iron Man and Captain America and the rest of the superheroes in that other (Disney) Marvel Comics universe are more interesting when they work alone (their tag-team stuff is getting old fast) the mutants who show up at Xaviers manse to be schooled and trained and guidance-counseled havent been able to make it by themselves. Watching Apocalypse you dont feel as if every character is being set up for his or her own spinoff. They complement one another. They need one another. The overflowing ensemble nature of the enterprise is the whole point. And while you might miss Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen the younger-generation ""reboot"" has been handled with unusual grace. Many of these mutants are more engaging than their older incarnations. Now that their ""origin stories"" have been sketched out its more clear than ever that these mutants have had good reason to hate a world that has rejected and/or injured them. Thats how the super-villain Apocalypse (boomingly voiced by Oscar Isaac) gets under their skin -- by preying on their resentments. Introduced in a cheesy but stirring dawn-of-time prologue Apocalypse mixes vigilantism with Old Testament fervor. Hes like the Travis Bickle who tells a presidential candidate Senator Palantine ""This city here is like an open sewer. ... Its full of filth and scum. ... I think that the President should just clean up this whole mess here. You should just flush it right down the fuckin toilet."" Apocalypse wants to flush the world right down the fuckin toilet and he recruits ""four horsemen""-- among them Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) -- to help raze the planet. Where Professor Xavier (James McEvoy) exhorts his students to control their supernatural powers and use them more selectively the Anti-Xavier turns his disciples into weapons of mass destruction. On a lighter note Do you love watching Jennifer Lawrence stride around looking sexy determined and sometimes an increasingly violet shade of blue? I do -- even though Mystique/Raven has gone the Katniss Everdeen route and become an ""inspiration"" to young female mutants. She needs to reclaim her punk rebelliousness. There are however a couple of female punks in Apocalypses mini-armada. As Psylocke Olivia Munn shows up in killer dominatrix garb and is whip-cracklingly good. Alexandra Shipp is the new bad girl version of storm and shes refreshingly expressive after her predecessor Halle Berry -- who Oscar be damned has never met a line she cant make sound tinny. Singer feels in his loins the fetishistic nature of the superhero genre. He goes as far away from Disney-style Marvel as his corporate masters will allow. On the new Team X redheaded Sophie Turner makes a tremulous Jean Grey and is a distinct improvement on her rather blank predecessor. I loved watching her though I admit it had as much to do with her other famous role The House of Stark has been so hideously abused that its great to see one of its members finally kick ass. Meanwhile characters seen fleetingly in other X-Men films have begun to acquire dramatic stature. Nicholas Hoults blue Beast is a melancholy sweetheart with fangs at the ready. As Cyclops Tye Sheridans incendiary impulses are an extension of his high-school alienation. Kodi Smit-McPhees Nightcrawler is pitifully ill at ease in a body that defies understanding--which makes his first experiences of teamwork that much more affecting. Evan Peterss Quicksilver is in a class by himself. Moving so fast that the only way to depict his heroism is in ultra-slow motion he saves his fellow mutants in a slo-mo slapstick ballet that would bring salutes from a couple of silent-movie clowns I can think of. Theres another comic action set-piece that isnt in the same league but has its charms -- a prison break thats a howl in more ways than one and boasts a roaringly good cameo. You say that Rose Byrne is wasted as the vanilla CIA agent Moira Mactaggert? I say that Rose Byrne in any form can class up any joint. Which leaves the stars McAvoy and Fassbender. The stickiest narrative problem is how McEvoys Xavier will lose his hair in the complete absence of conventional male-pattern baldness. Fortunately the filmmakers accomplish this in a way that makes thematic (if no other) sense Xaviers empathic link with the body-swapping Apocalypse would burn out most peoples brains so his hair seems a small price to pay. Hail empathy Fassbenders Magneto is of course the dramatic linchpin and you could argue that its a drag watching him drift to the dark side yet again and get pulled back by his old friend Xavier yet again and drift to the dark side yet again. But X-Men Apocalypse pushes the formula to another level. The films most heartbreaking scene is a face-off with hapless confused soldiers in which Erik living in remote Poland with his wife and daughter under an assumed identity learns the impossibility of passing for normal. The ghastly spectacle haunts the rest of the movie. Am I grading on a curve in praising X-Men Apocalypse? Of course. Films of its ilk are compromised at every level by the demands of studios -- which have now structured their entire existence on building ""franchises"" ""tent-poles"" and ""universes."" If you go into this movie with no investment in its mythos you will be indifferent to much (though not all) of it. But in many scenes Singer captures both the pain of being an outsider and the potentially ruinous temptations that come with newfound power. He can hold his head high in regards to this film if little else.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims May 26 2016 Culture One of the few memorable moments in X-Men Apocalypse the latest gaudiest and certainly laziest entry in the long-running franchise is centered around its best character Magneto. Often a villain sometimes a grudging hero Magneto has literally been through wars surviving the Holocaust as a child suffering persecution for his mutant powers and even weathering a change in the actor portraying him (from Ian McKellen to Michael Fassbender). Apocalypse brings him back to Auschwitz to have him tear it apart in fury turning the most solemn site of human suffering imaginable into yet another CGI miasma. Amid the tonal confusion the only thing left to really admire about the sequence is its chutzpah. Related Story X-Men A Blast From the Past (and Future) Its just too bad that chutzpah is lacking in almost every other moment of X-Men Apocalypse a frantic spectacle that seems to be trying to keep up with the ever-widening scope of superhero movies while still vaguely keeping a finger on the pulse of the earlier films broad allegory. The heroes are still mutants super-powered people who are largely societal outcasts and can be used to stand in for a range of oppressed minorities often in a ham-fisted manner. But the villain of the latest film isnt the hatred of mankind as it was in the eight other X-Men films and spinoffs released since 2000. Its the titular Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) a big blue dude from ancient Egypt who wants to wipe the earth clean and start anew. Why? The film answers with a shrug. Considering the flimsy storytelling and characterization on display here maybe a fresh start wouldnt be such a bad idea.I like so many other viewers am fatigued by the franchise at this point. When the first X-Men film was released 16 years ago directed (as this entry is) by Bryan Singer it laid out an exciting blueprint for the comic-book movie that went beyond the simple hero-villain dynamics of Batman or Superman. Its heroes were weird sometimes violent often strange-looking and their internal tensions were as interesting as those with their adversaries. X-Men opened with a scene of a young Magneto first displaying his powers of magnetism at a concentration camp and it felt audacious--the moment gave the whole silly affair a little more weight. Most importantly that films action scenes were relatively small and the conflicts had stakes that were easy to understand.How times have changed. Franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and big-budget efforts like Batman v Superman have blown the narrative out as wide as possible and set a new formula. More characters Story arcs that go on for years As many CGI-laden set-pieces as possible within a colossal budget The X-Men franchise now feels desperately behind the times with the last entry Days of Future Past largely devoted to saying goodbye to the films older cast (including McKellen Halle Berry Patrick Stewart and others). Apocalypse is an effort to catch up to that grander mode of comic-book storytelling but its epic scope is a mile wide and an inch deep.Considering the flimsy storytelling and characterization maybe a fresh start wouldnt be such a bad idea.The film begins in ancient Egypt naturally where the life force of the godlike mutant Apocalypse is being transferred into the body of a new host (the process is complicated but seems to involve solar-powered prehistoric USB cables). Hes then buried under a landslide so it takes thousands of years before he wakes up and starts going about his mission. To destroy the Earth all he needs is four followers some booming commands and a little bit of elbow grease. Isaac tries his best to enjoy the bland villainy of the role but hes covered in layers of absurd blue makeup and his voice is modulated beyond recognition so its impossible for him to make a strong impression.Apocalypse gathers up a force of mutants including the energy-sword-wielding martial artist Psylocke (Olivia Munn) the winged teen Archangel (Ben Hardy) and a young Storm (Alexandra Shipp) one of the greatest heroes in the X-Men comics catalog whos given embarrassingly short shrift by the writing here. Magneto is Apocalypses fourth ""horseman"" and his initiation is the destruction of Auschwitz an moment of incredible impressive tastelessness thats unfortunately aiming for utter self-seriousness.X-Men Apocalypse could have worked if it had been aiming for fun like the similarly bombastic Gods of Egypt. Instead its mostly just a pitched battle between the X-Men led by the telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and the rebel shapeshifter Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). The film introduces younger versions of Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) but both are lost in the crowd. Meanwhile the films legacy players range from Fassbenders usual devoted intensity to Lawrences absolute detachment--clearly doing her third X-Men film through contractual obligation she reads lines as if a car is waiting to collect her outside once shes done.There are some moments of levity where the movie does shine--the return of the speedster Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who gets a long slow-motion rescue sequence in the middle of the movie is a particular highlight. But as Apocalypses world-destroying plans spring into action things get very stupid very quickly and the final action sequences are cacophonies of energy rays and lightning bolts crashing into each other for no particular purpose. In an effort to rise to the spectacle of the superhero movies around him Singer has forgotten what made his earlier work on this series so winning--if the X-Men franchise is here to stay (and by its box-office numbers it probably is) it at least needs a fresh creative direction to follow in the future. I wont spoil whether Apocalypse completes his dastardly plan but viewers shouldnt be surprised if they find themselves rooting for him by the end.

But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches.

""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

We understand (FOX) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 26 2016 at 835 AM updated May 26 2016 at 855 AM comments Theres used to be a raw raucous Tex-Mex club in New York called the Lone Star with a giant statue of an iguana on the roof. Its Texas-sized motto? ""Too Much Aint Enough."" Too many superhero films agree. Things were crowded enough in the first ""X-Men."" But after 16 years two trilogies and several spinoffs the series has introduced literally dozens of different superheroes --several of them played by multiple actors in separate or even parallel timeframes. Like the bar bragged Too much aint enough. Because the ""X-Men"" movies have so many characters though theres little room left for story. Although the last two films offered some enjoyable retro-topicality (the first was set during the Cold War 60s the second during the 70s Paris peace talks) the plotlines have become so mechanical theyre practically schematic. New mutants are introduced. Old feuds/flirtations are rekindled. Magneto does something vengeful that pushes everyone except Prof. Xavier and Mystique to give up on him. Then in the end Magneto feels guilty and does something heroic after all. Prof. Xavier begs him to stay and work for peace. Magneto grumbles and walks away again. Oh and at some point Wolverine shows up. Obviously this plotline works; if it didnt the franchise wouldnt have made a few billion dollars. But compared to the emotion in something like ""The Dark Knight"" or ""Captain America Winter Soldier"" (or even the humor in the first ""Iron Man"" or ""Avengers"") its a little thin. And this film recycles the same old elements again. This go-round brings back most of the stars from the last sequel ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" while moving into the 80s and adding some new actors. As Prof. Xavier James McAvoy remains passionately committed; as Magneto Michael Fassbender either yells at the heavens or floats in them looking contemplative while chaos swirls around. Both actors are fine and bring some gravitas. Its also good to have Evan Peters back as a sarcastic teen Quicksilver too while Kodi-Smit McPhee joins the cast as a younger and if possible even bluer Nightcrawler. They provide the films lighter moments. Yet most of the other performances just drag things down. Its understandable that Jennifer Lawrence is bored with Mystique by now - but cant she try to hide it? And Ben Hardys pretty Angel merely pouts and poses while as Jean Grey and Cyclops Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan are wan substitutes for Famke Janssen and James Marsden. Nor is the plot much help. Typically it follows the usual template merely giving us a new villain in Apocalypse an ancient Egyptian mutant who wakes up and wants to destroy the world because weve made such a terrible mess of it. MORE A few words with Stan Lee No argument there - although the idea feels a little more Book of Genesis than Book of the Dead - but visually hes just a big grey guy in clunky boots and Oscar Isaacs slightly stilted voiceover seems based more on reverb than drama. Theres also one scene which just feels grotesque when Apocalypse brings Magneto to the empty ruins of Auschwitz -- while Olivia Munns sexy Psylocke strides around in a crotch-grabbing leotard and thigh-high boots. Admitted its only a set - but using even the idea of Auschwitz as a backdrop for superbabe cheesecake is appalling. Nothing in the rest of the movie rises to that level of bad taste. But then nothing in the rest of the movie really rises to any level. Why is Bryan Singer even making this? Does he remember? Theres an epic opening sequence and the boy-toy eyecandy of Angel. But any political metaphor the story had (for African-American rights in the original comics; for gay rights in the first film) has long since been buried under CGI merchandizing strategies and brand building. After nearly two-and-a-half hours of mass destruction fiery explosions and half-forgotten characters (wait who was Moira McTaggert again?) the result isnt so much exhilaration as exhaustion. Like Jennifer Lawrence were getting a little bored. And coming to realize that No. Sometimes too much is more than enough. Ratings note The film contains violence and some brief strong language. X-Men Apocalypse (PG-13) Fox (144 min.) Directed by Bryan Singer. With James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Oscar Isaac Jennifer Lawrence. Now playing in New Jersey.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its hard to know whether to welcome ""X-Men Apocalypse"" with melancholic disappointment or testy annoyance. Bryan Singer a more than capable director once again returns to the Marvel mutant saga he began in 2000. He launched the first two films in the series with a level of craftsmanship and intelligence that turned the comic-book genre into big serious business. Without those game-changing hits Christopher Nolans dark Batman trilogy and Disneys witty irreverent Marvel Cinematic Universe might not have arrived. And now theres this hollow unfocused mess. Singers fourth X-Men film is not just a step down its a fall down the stairs. This time the story is action all the way. There are a dozen sequences where the camera tumbles down some rabbit hole of doom or looks on while immense boulders crush casualties. They feel like visual diagrams of the movies collapse. Its big in scope and scale and tiny in originality. Using the new term ""drop"" for a movies release was invented for tailspin declines like this. The X-Men films have bounced across various timelines springing from the Holocaust to Hiroshima to the 1970s to the recent past as if the superpowered characters were on trampolines. This episode deposits them in the 80s but opens with a dismal prologue in Egypt 3600 B.C. Flattening landmarks is an action film staple and here the destruction hits a gargantuan pyramid. Inside that structure is En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac unrecognizable in steely blue makeup) a ruthless entity absorbing eternal life through ornate enchanted technology. His immortality is halted when guards betray the ""false god"" crashing the sloping walls atop him like dominoes. Millennia later he returns to the surface like a really cross mummy raising an army of evil mutant allies and making magic-wavy-hand gestures against humans. Twentieth Century Fox Michael Fassbender reprises his role as Magneto. Apocalypse also seems to be juggling the films convoluted plot lines and character back stories which scarcely fit together. A large cast of 16 comic book characters returns here eight of them recast since their last appearance none of them holding center stage. James McAvoys schoolmaster for young mutants Professor X delivers another serving of his signature charm moving into new anguished territory only when Apocalypse grows to Paul Bunyan size and pounds him with giant fists. Michael Fassbender reprises his role as the antihero Magneto levitating himself while pinching his face into a constipated scowl. Jennifer Lawrence as the chameleon Raven/Mystique propels her scenes through sheer force of personality. Her dialogue and character arc are so creatively malnourished that Scarlett Johanssons walk-by role as Black Widow in ""Captain America Civil War"" pushes her aside in its wake. Hugh Jackmans speechless cameo as Wolverine works; 16 years since he created the role hes still a remarkable roughneck. But his minor presence here is sheer fan service. The bedrock virtues of Singers earlier work from ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Apt Pupil"" through his superhero crowd-pleasers were his commitment to surprising and challenging audiences. His characters had unexpected dimensions and his stories had a meaning or two that he would not allow to fall out of focus. Never for a moment does this X-Men revisit the issues of tribal prejudice minority rights and alienation that made his earlier films so compelling. Here we have a team of characters in high-tech battle gear combating a rival squad of bad guys as Dr. Evil aims to wipe out our world for no clearly defined purpose. Even die-hard Comic-Con fans can take only so much of this but the films attention to international marketing seems likely to deliver a hit. Olivia Munns villainess Psylocke swings a samurai sword that should delight fans in Asia where 70 percent of film profits are mined today. The film would be a success if the only thing that mattered about producing movies was making a profit. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Dawn Burkes Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Some fans are excited about X-Men Apocalypse. Some are nervous.Both camps are right to be. And theyall probably add a soupASSon of disappointment a and anticipation of whatas still to come for the franchise.All of the expected thrills of a superhero movie are in place. Mass destruction of recognizable landmarks? Check. Easter eggs for longtime fans that wonat lose first-time watchers? Check. Reinvention of key characters in the canon? Sigh a| check.But audiences have been there and seen that. Apocalypse is absolutely fine except for the feeling that weave seen it all before. Just like audiencesa emotions the film is all over the place. There are just too many moving pieces. Thatas been true of all the X-Men movies come to think of it. And that can be OK because it comes with the territory the movies have always been completely about the team with hardly a supporting player in the bunch. Thatas quite unlike the world- and character-building thatas gone on with that other Marvel team-up franchise. Back to the story at hand The not-quite-yet X-Men face a mutant who many believe was the worldas first. We meet En Sabah Nur during a grand ceremony of an opening scene set in the Nile Valley in 3600 B.C. After a train ride through history all the way to 1983 the students at Charles Xavieras School for Gifted Youngsters are (re)introduced.Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is an ageless all-powerful mutant. When a body gets too old for his uses he transfers to another and absorbs whatever power happens to be within it. When he awakens from a forced slumber in 1983 he does not like what he sees. In his mind only the strong should survive and he wants to make it so.He starts gathering powerful mutants a four horsemen natch a to help him with his plan. Once aware of his presence our nascent team realizes that the stakes are high. Theyare fighting for everyoneas world mutant and human alike. This is serious so much so that even the cameos are glum. Some of the set pieces are wonders. So too is Michael Fassbender back as Erik Lehnsherr. And as usual the best story is that of Magneto. He always has the right reasons for doing the wrong thing. In this movie things are no different. Magneto always comes with a dose of sadness. But there are many moments of levity especially any time Quicksilver (Evan Peters who has a way with stealing scenes) runs through. Jennifer Lawrence is very comfortable in the blue skin of Mystique and James McAvoy (Professor X) is having great fun. What should you see in movie theaters this summer? In more than a nod to the source material enthralled horsemen Storm (Alexandra Shipp) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn) look uncomfortable but glorious as if they stepped right off the comic pages. True believers will get a thrill every time Psylocke unleashes her psychic blade. (Youall be able to play a good game of Spot the Mutant as our heroes a and our villains a gather their forces.)Pay close attention to the dialogue as it will foreshadow what is to come. Jean Grey (Sophie Turner with sorrow in her eyes) and Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) are children here; you know the story. And after the events of Apocalypse thereas plenty of room to tell it.The X-Men have always existed in a high-flying world-beating universe quite unlike that of other superhero properties which can seem much more grounded even with tights and flights. In Fantastic Four they worried about paying bills. In Captain America Civil War Cap did his own laundry. In The Dark Knight Rises Batman is broken. So it may be wrong to expect a film titled Apocalypse to be mindful of mundane things. The franchise reinvigorated by the stellar underappreciated First Class stumbles a bit at the reset after Days of Future Past. Moviegoers would do well to adjust their expectations accordingly. Director Bryan Singer who started the franchise in 2000 has always had a vision when it comes to these movies. Remember the anticipation we talked about? His Apocalypse may be noisy but one thing is clear Itas a setup. And thatas worth watching. Goes Well With...

A wrathful god (Oscar Isaac) rises from a multimillennial coma takes one look at the world circa 1983 and decides it must be ""cleansed."" Magneto (Michael Fassbender) Holocaust survivor and longtime X-Men antagonist has taken refuge in Poland where hes betrayed by his countrymen and engages in the highly ritualized destruction of Auschwitz. Righteously embittered Magneto allies himself with Isaacs mutant deity-unsurprisingly named Apocalypse-and his ""four horsemen"" a concept taken from the Bible someone notes. ""Or the Bible got it from him"" warns Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) suggesting that the Book of Revelation might have been inspired by Marvel Comics. If all this sounds wildly entertaining its not. Bryan Singer directing his third X sequel since 2000s X-Men has devoted his care and attention (and that of his effects team) to a great deal of 3-D destruction. CGI wrath-of-God-type stuff has become a reflex at Marvel but its precisely not what made the franchises previous installment-the highly profitable highly praised Days of Future Past-such an entertaining movie. Picking up 10 years later Apocalypse cedes supremacy to computers and the humans are phoning it in presumably on Reagan-era landlines. Which is a shame because the X-Men series with its constant tug-of-war between tortured heroism and neurotic whining is fertile ground for exploring intolerance exclusion tribalism and a frequent neofascist impulse among Xers born of a well-founded paranoia regarding the worlds view of mutants. The opposing arguments are generally made by the antihuman Magneto and his longtime frenemy Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) founder of Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters. Played rather breathlessly by McAvoy Xavier views his nascent X-Men as potential protectors and benefactors of humanity. His faith is regularly tested. So is our patience by a movie with several things awry besides wooden acting portentous dialogue and the virtual vandalism of that Auschwitz scene. For example theres Singers penchant for gory violence with none of the gore. You want to revel in bloodshed? Show the blood. Otherwise what you have is Wolverine porn. (Yes Hugh Jackman shows up late in the game.) Theres also a tendency toward overkill the high-speed Quicksilver (Evan Peters) whose ability to change the trajectory of fired bullets made for one of the previous movies best scenes does the same kind of thing here only more. Much more. Too much more. The movies top-flight cast is left in ridiculous positions. Fassbender for instance floats about in the air Magneto-izing all of earths metal and dismantling such architectural icons as the Manhattan Bridge and the Sydney Opera House. (Why doesnt a supervillain ever destroy the MetLife Building? That wed like to watch.) Isaac a really gifted actor lumbers through the film clad in what looks like a Tiffany hot-water heater adorned with silverware patterns and black bath mats. What exactly is Apocalypses problem? Its unclear. Sure the world of 1983 is a mess-there are superpower politics a nuclear-arms race and a culture that might especially to one accustomed to the aesthetic of the Babylonian-Sumerian-Egyptian epoch seem polluted at best. ""For this I was betrayed?"" he bellows harking back to his entombment in 3600 B.C. Egypt and feigning some kind of personal philosophy. He has none. He has no objective other than power no policy other than wholesale destruction. Singer who will undoubtedly be making X-Men movies till the blue mutant cows come home has said he wanted a real actor playing Apocalypse. But Isaac is wasted in a role with little emotional energy. A major household appliance would have delivered more heat. This appears in the June 06 2016 issue of TIME. Tap to read full story Order a Reprint Read Next Your browser is out of date.

EntertainmentMovies X-Men Apocalypse stale but not quite a disaster Originally published May 26 2016 at 1200 am Updated May 26 2016 at 146 pm Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) has the power to manipulate magnetic fields in ""X-Men Apocalypse."" (Photo Credit Courtesy Twentieth) Review of ""X-Men Apocalypse"" Action scenes look impressive but the franchise used to be more fun. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic OK lets get this straight The new ""X-Men"" movie is the sixth in the franchise not counting origin stories/spinoffs and the third in the current younger-generation trilogy. It takes place mostly though not entirely in the 1980s where the events of the earlier ""X-Men"" movies are taught in school as a handy way of catching audiences up. And once again some ghastly mutant is hellbent on destroying the world This time its Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) who at least has an informative X-name. In other words things are getting a little stale in the X-world and ""X-Men Apocalypse"" while a perfectly competent superhero installment doesnt do much to stir up excitement. How many times can the mutants save the world? How many times can we hear someone solemnly intone ""A gift can be a curse""? How many times do I need to point out that 3D action movies are blurry and dark and probably better in 2D? (Can someone please appoint a mutant -- surely theres someone in this universe who can fix the special effects in Hollywood movies by breathing hard or something -- to look into this problem?) The strength of this franchise has long been its impressive acting roster -- think in the early films of the absolutely electric faceoffs between Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart -- and the current cast has some good moments Michael Fassbenders moody Magneto James McAvoys idealistic Xavier Evan Peters quick-witted Quicksilver. And a favorite from the earlier trilogy pops by for a funny cameo. (""Thats the last well see of that guy"" someone deadpans. Maybe.) Movie Review 1/2   X-Men Apocalypse with James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Oscar Isaac Nicholas Hoult Rose Byrne Tye Sheridan Sophie Turner Olivia Munn Evan Peters Lucas Till Kodi Smit-McPhee. Directed by Bryan Singer from a screenplay by Simon Kinberg. 147 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence action and destruction brief strong language and some suggestive images. Several theaters. But the population has gotten so crowded all but the most ardent fans of the comic might find themselves wishing for explanatory footnotes on the characters. And Simon Kinbergs screenplay tends to overexplain things -- which is why the film checks in at a bloated two and a half hours. ""It will end with some kind of ... apocalypse"" says Rose Byrnes Moira McTaggert dramatically of the havoc being wreaked. ""The end of the world"" chimes in Xavier helpfully.

Its not clear whats happening next for the X-universe; early versions of ""Apocalypse"" screened for press did not include a post-credits bonus scene though I hear there might be one in the released version (somebody tell me). Perhaps the franchise is due for a well-deserved rest. Moira Macdonald mmacdonaldseattletimes.com or 206-464-2725.

At least not En Sabah Nur the mad despot who ruled the throne in 3600 BC and who is busy making plans to rule the world for all eternity at the beginning of the too serious too long X-Men Apocalypse. As the super-mutant nemesis of the latest and perhaps loudest X-Men installment Sabah Nur has a fixed grim countenance and a sickly blue hue a low rumbling bellow and a clunky armored cybersuit - all of which makes the casting of the talented Oscar Isaac in the role pretty much a complete waste. Ohio governor John Kasich could have served just as well. Speaking of Ohio thats where director Bryan Singer opts to drop down following his movies 4th millennium BC prologue (a coup in Sabar Nurs pyramid - angry citizens warning of the ""false god""). Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) is a Buckeye high schooler in need of an optician - his eyes emit deadly blasts of fire and he doesnt know what to do about it. Luckily he has an older brother with his own mutant powers who brings his troubled sib to Professor Charles Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters - an ivy-ed estate outside New York City where kids with freakish powers learn to harness them and hopefully assimilate into society. The year is 1983 and Xavier as he was in 2011s prequel X-Men First Class and 2014s companion piece X-Men Days of Future Past is played by James McAvoy presiding over his institute with a sad-eyed but sanguine look safe in the knowledge that he will grow old to look more and more like Patrick Stewart. It is here in Westchester County - and then in East Berlin and the forests of Poland among other fave tourist spots - that the X-Men are introduced (or reintroduced if youve been keeping up). Jennifer Lawrence is back as Mystique with her spray-on glittery blue skin and her shapeshifting skill sets. Nicholas Hoult is Hank McCoy a.k.a. Beast a blue wolf-y guy. (Alternative title for X-Men Apocalypse - Blue Is the Weirdest Color?) Lucas Till is Alex Summers a.k.a. Havok a guy who is literally full of energy. Sophie Turner is Jean Grey Xaviers telekinetic soulmate. Kodi Smit-McPhee is Nightcrawler a teleporting teen. And Evan Peters is Peter Maximoff a.k.a. Quicksilver whose ability to stop time comes in handy at a most critical juncture. (He gets the best musical accompaniment too dashing around in hyperspeed to Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams Are Made of This."") And then there is the troubled Magneto whose real name is Erik Lehnsherr and who again is played by a stern and somber Michael Fassbender. It is in the aforementioned Polish woods that Erik has carved out a new anonymous life working in a factory and coming home to his loving wife and lovely child. Its a modest meaningful existence so you know it will soon come to a sorry end which it does leading to Magnetos ill-advised alliance with the eons-old Egyptian tyrant. Magneto and Xavier mutant comrades are now at odds just like the warring superheroes of Captain America Civil War and Batman v. Superman Dawn of Justice. Cant we all just get along? Also figuring prominently in X-Men Apocalypse is Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert. She has a love-thing going with Professor Xavier although she doesnt know it because hes erased their romance from her memory. And prominently displaying her figure is Olivia Munn clad in saucy warrior garb and striking sexy poses as Psylocke a mutant who aligns herself with Mr. Apocalypse. Yes its quite a crowd and thats not the half of it. This ninth installment in the Marvel mutant superhero franchise is rife with urgent and (dare we say?) apocalyptic comings and goings with characters and confrontations that seem at once familiar and befuddling. Its the end of the world as we know it - because weve seen it in a dozen other superhero movies by now. sreaphillynews.com215-854-5629 MOVIE REVIEW X-Men Apocalypse 2 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Bryan Singer.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1103am on Friday May. 27 2016 Friday May. 27 2016 Tuesday May. 24 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The last two ""X-Men"" movies -- Days of Future Past(2014) and First Class (2011) -- were wonderful surprises that didnt conform to the notion that sequels are more than likely woefully inferior to the original. Rejuvenating the Marvel franchise with a strong alternate cast playing youthful versions of the characters turned out to be a stroke of blockbuster inspiration.But it may be too much to ask for cinematic lightning to strike three times as X-Men Apocalypse which has some exhilarating scenes ultimately turns into the kind of lumbering special-effects-laden spectacle that the previous films mostly avoided. Savvy moments where our mutant heroes become relatable as human beings are outweighed by pyrotechnics especially in the second half.While First Class was set in the early 60s and the time-traveling Future Past partially took place in 1973 this one has the early 80s as a backdrop a time when humanity is still uncertain about how to deal with the revelation that mutants with special powers walk among us.After the near-tragic events at the end of Future Past Erik (Michael Fassbender) aka Magneto has fled to rural Poland where he lives a quiet life as a metal worker with a wife and daughter. Raven ( Jennifer Lawrence) aka Mystique has gone underground in Germany helping fellow mutants forced into elaborate cage-fight matches escape. One of those she frees is Kurt (Kodi Smit-McPhee) aka Nightcrawler.Meanwhile back in the U.S. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) continues to run his School for Gifted Youngsters (sort of a magnet school for mutants) with an able assist from Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) aka Beast. Teenage Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) aka Cyclops is brought to the school because he has no clue how to keep his mutant power -- deadly beams from his eyes -- under control. The whole mutant thing runs in the family as hes brought to Xaviers attention by his brother Alex (Lucas Till) whose superhero name is Havok.When he doesnt have death rays clouding his vision Cyclops is able to see an attraction with another student Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) who coincidentally has trouble controlling her telekinetic powers.The individual stories intersect when humanity falls under threat from Apocalypse (an underutilized Oscar Isaac) an ancient powerful mutant from Egypt who is awakened from a long slumber. Unsurprisingly hes not a big fan of the modern world and seeks to destroy all of civilization and make himself the supreme ruler of whatevers left.He has a few power-hungry mutant underlings on his side including Storm (Alexandra Shipp) Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and Angel (Ben Hardy). He even recruits the emotionally wounded Magneto. Of course our good mutants have to save the day.There are flashes of brilliance. The scene where Magnetos cover is blown and he and his family are confronted by local Polish police in a forest is a strikingly staged and surprisingly emotional moment in a movie that could use more of them. Its nice to see that Fassbender McAvoy and Sheridan dont look as if theyre slumming just because theyre in a superhero movie. As with the previous two films there are some sly nods to the eras pop culture.But the problem with this latest incarnation once again directed by Bryan Singer can be summed up in one character Quicksilver (Evan Peters). In Future Past his ability to move so fast that everything around him turns to dreamlike slow motion was a highlight. His big scene set to the Jim Croce song Time in a Bottle remains a masterpiece of tongue-in-cheek humor and effects.In Apocalypse he does a similar feat except this time its to the Eurythmics Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This). While its still impressive you may feel as if youve seen it all before.Data curated by PrettyFamousData curated by PrettyFamousData curated by PrettyFamous Cary Darling 817-390-7571 carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

"Review Theres a lot to like in X-Men Apocalypse even if plot echoes Captain America and Batman v Superman - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Theres a lot to like in X-Men Apocalypse even if plot echoes Captain America and Batman v SupermanBy Sandy Cohen Associated PressPosted 05/24/2016 114720 AM PDTUpdated 05/25/2016 081037 PM PDT Its a bit of bad timing for ""X-Men Apocalypse"" to arrive third in this summers superhero lineup. While battles between heroes are an X-Men tradition warring among the ranks is also at the heart of both ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice"" and ""Captain America Civil War.""Like similarly dressed beauties in celebrity magazines it becomes a case of who wears the plot to better effect even though thats an unfair burden on a film that ultimately brings a satisfying conclusion to the rebooted X-Men trilogy.And though its ensemble includes Jennifer Lawrence Michael Fassbender and an unrecognizable Oscar Isaac (Poe from ""Star Wars"") the new ""X-Men"" cant match the magic of the latest Avengers movie with its multiple characters carefully developed over a dozen films. ""Apocalypse"" is also a prequel so we already know who survives. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in X-Men Apocalypse. (Twentieth Century Fox) ( Twentieth Century Fox ) Still director Bryan Singer invigorates the new film with vintage 1980s charm in an origin story about how the mutant supergroup unites and divides in response to the awakening of Apocalypse. And the film is fun in its own right with its grand scope and great special effects and it doesnt require a viewers knowledge of its predecessors to be enjoyed even if those who already know the characters get an even bigger payoff. As hinted at during the credits for 2014s ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" Apocalypse is a super-powered mutant who can transfer his essence from one being to another. He was revered as a god in a prior existence millennia ago.Advertisement Resurrected from dormancy in 1983 Apocalypse is disgusted at the state of the world. He wants to wipe out greedy intolerant humans and restore the mutants to deified status. And he magnifies the power of any mutant who sides with him. Meanwhile Professor X (James McAvoy) has renewed his focus on his School for Gifted Children where Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) are among the students learning to control their powers. The professors friend and rival Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Fassbender) has put aside his mutant powers to live as a family man in Poland. But when personal tragedy strikes he goes on a destructive binge.Magneto and other disillusioned mutants -- including Storm (Alexandra Shipp) Angel (Ben Hardy) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn) -- join forces with Apocalypse. Professor X and his proteges -- including Raven/Mystique (Lawrence) and fellow blue person Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) -- unite to try to stop them. A muscular mutton-chopped X-Man here referred to as Weapon X isnt part of the fight but provides some thrills in a brief shirtless cameo. McAvoy is all charm as Professor X. Fassbender brings gravitas to Magneto. Lawrence though comes across as if she might be tired of big franchise fare.The standouts in both character and performance are Jean Gray and Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver (Evan Peters). Gray seems even more confident and powerful here than when Famke Janssen played her in the previous and subsequent chapters in the ""X-Men"" chronology and she utters the movies best self-referential barb. In speaking of trilogies she says ""At least we can all agree the third ones always the worst."" Peters shines as Quicksilver a dorky-cool ultra-80s Marty McFly who provides playful comedy as well as zippy action sequences. Magneto also inspires awesome special-effects action imploding and pulverizing historic sites.Simon Kinbergs screenplay includes some lame lines at key moments (""He thought that you were going to make a difference in this world maybe even change it""). But otherwise his script keeps the storys movement brisk and its back stories clear. Even if the Avengers wore their plot a tad better the X-Men are doing just fine.

"X-Men Apocalypse | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x-men-apocalypse ) X-Men Apocalypse (United States 2016) May 23 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli If theres an obstacle to the potential box office success of X-Men Apocalypse its the growing sense of superhero movie fatigue. Counting Deadpool this is the fourth superhero movie to reach screens in the last three-plus months. With the market saturated like that its not hard to envision a scenario in which non-fans dont bother. After all there are only so many times one can watch massive battle scenes and cutting edge special effects without experiencing twinges of boredom.  X-Men Apocalypse is a competently made superhero action film but its not a game-changer and its brand of action seems a little too familiar. The ending in particular has a ""been there done that"" feel. Superhero movies are struggling to up their game. Weve gone from single-hero adventures to multi-hero teams to...what? It now appears that the next frontier is to pit the good guys against nearly omnipotent adversaries. While this allows for a greater spectacle its a narrative dead-end. Its almost impossible to pit any group against a godlike entity and not have the resolution feel like a contrived cheat. It doesnt matter whether the villain is Galactus Thanos Darkseid or Apocalypse. The Ultimate Nullifier might have worked in a comic book in 1966 but it would never work (at least as initially conceived) in a 2016 movie. The problem remains how to credibly defeat a being of almost limitless power. Its a riddle X-Men Apocalypse isnt fully able to solve. When it comes to superhero movies the X-Men are near the bottom of the A-list. This is partially the result of inconsistent filmmaking and partially because of Foxs inability to keep up with changing trends. If the Avengers represent the gold standard the X-Men despite being the silver screens first comic book-to-movie team are playing catch-up. And because Hugh Jackmans Wolverine is without question the most popular of the X-Men director Bryan Singer finds a way to shoehorn him into Apocalypse. Theres no purpose for him to be there. Yes his scene (and its really little more than an extended cameo) is cool but its as much a marketing ploy as having Wonder Woman in Batman v. Superman or Spider-Man in Captain America Civil War. Concerns aside its a fun movie. The first two-thirds are well-done with the backstory of Magneto (Michael Fassbender) post- Days of Future Past adding a layer of poignancy to proceedings. The conflicted character is played like a Shakespearean tragic hero and Fassbender invests himself in this interpretation. Magneto has never been more compelling or complex - and thats saying a lot since the series has gone to great lengths to make him more than a garden variety megalomaniac. The film begins about a decade after the universe reboot accomplished in the fifth X-Men movie Days of Future Past. Professor X (James McAvoy) has established his School for Gifted Children as a place where mutants can come to learn to control their abilities in a safe and nurturing environment. New students include Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) and Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) who (as Cyclops and Phoenix) will become core members of the X-Men team. Meanwhile in Poland Magnetos idyllic life with a wife and young daughter comes to an end when in moment of careless compassion he gives himself away. And in Egypt CIA agent Moira Mactaggert (Rose Byrne) inadvertently starts a chain reaction that results in the awakening of the first most dangerous mutant of all Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) whose return may mean an end to civilization. Many of the early action sequences are well-conceived and executed. Of special note is a sequence in which lightning fast-moving Quicksilver (Evan Peters) rescues dozens of people from a burning crumbling mansion. The mini-battles between various X-Men and the four heralds of Apocalypse - Magneto Angel (Ben Hardy) Storm (Alexandre Shipp) and Psylocke (Olivia Munn) - are more exciting than the climactic struggle between Professor X and the title villain. The resolution could have been worse but at best it can be described as anticlimactic. As indicated above thats the problem with pitting mortal characters against a god. Its tough to engineer an upset without top-notch writing and as solid as Simon Kinbergs screenplay is its not on the level where it would need to be to make this a classic superhero tale. X-Men Apocalypse introduces many new mutants in an attempt to set up a future that (likely) wont feature Hugh Jackman or Jennifer Lawrence the two highest wattage stars of the franchise. Tye Sheridans Cyclops is a more relatable less egotistical version of the character played by James Madsen in the original trilogy. Sophie Turners Jean Grey is softer and more sympathetic than Famke Janssen.  Add Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Quicksilver and theres no lack of mutant protagonists. Introducing them all in one movie however results in an overload. One of the problems with the recent X-Men trilogy (staring with First Class) is that we seem to be stuck in a never-ending origin story. Visually Apocalypse is a mixed bag. Perhaps the most unimpressive aspect is the Apocalypse costume design. Buried under so much latex that he looks like a toad peering out of the mud Oscar Isaac isnt given an opportunity to display the charismatic energy he radiated so forcefully in Ex Machina. The Big Villain often looks more constipated than fearsome. And although the pyrotechnics would make Michael Bay proud the computer-generated special effects are uneven. Some exhibit flair in both conception and execution while others are unpolished and appear unfinished. One final note... Past X-Men movies have generally done a good job of depicting the friction resulting from a ""superhero class"" co-existing with normal human beings. This has been part and parcel of the X-Men series DNA from the start with the government seeking to restrict and persecute leading to an allegorical aspect. Sadly even as other franchises (Batman v. Superman Captain America Civil War) have started to address this X-Men Apocalypse backs away from it. Perhaps its because the film is juggling too many other subplots but the uneasy relationship between mutants and humans is addressed in only a few perfunctory scenes. It feels like a step backward from a milieu that was carefully constructed over the previous five features. As a superhero movie in general and an X-Men movie in particular Apocalypse delivers everything a viewer could reasonably expect from it. If it disappoints thats because unlike Christopher Nolans Batman movies and this years Deadpool (which features a couple of X-Men) it fails to transcend the genre. Its a safe bet for early summer entertainment - a loud colorful fast-moving spectacle. It should satisfy fans - both die-hard and casual - but theres nothing special about this production and many will (rightly) see it as ""just another comic book movie."" However for those who love this brand of wild escapist fare thats a badge to be worn proudly.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its 1983 in the X-Men movie multiverse and that means more Cold War threats more period fashions that skirt parody and more barking about the future of super-human-mutant-kind. Ever since X-Men First Class set the series clock back a few decades and installed Michael Fassbenders moody Magneto and James McAvoys louche Charles Xavier as replacements for Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewarts chess-playing pappies the big-screen X-Mens central conflict--Xaviers Booker T. Washington-esque School For Gifted Youngsters vs. a rogues gallery of evil mutants crew cuts and politicos--has gotten a lot murkier. For the franchises ballooning unmanageable cast of mutants picking sides now seems to have less to do with choosing between cooperation (which the recent movies implicitly distrust) and resistance and more with whichever flashback-prone white dudes overbearing savior complex works for you. X-Men Apocalypse directed by series mainstay Bryan Singer gives Magneto the Holocaust survivor who can control magnetic fields and Xavier the paraplegic telepath who tends to come off as really smug next-to-zero shared screen time. Alternate-timeline Earth may be under threat from the nuclear theatrics of the Reagan administration and the return of blue-skinned ancient Egyptian mutant Apocalypse (a bizarrely cast Oscar Isaac) but its nominal poles of right and wrong are bubbled away. At the start the two are leading idyllic dream lives. Magneto has returned to his native Poland where he lives quietly as an ironworker and family man in the last months of Solidarity. Xavier has his mansion full of young-people-in-need where he plays the part of the undergrad crush object shaggy hair English accent blazer hiked up to the elbow Miami Vice-style. Then everything goes to shit. Both perfect homes are destroyed--and yet the two men remain effectively passive locked in hang-ups while assorted proteges and allies do all the duking out and legwork. Even Isaac his face pinned in a look of hemorrhoidal discomfort by make-up and prosthetics plays the would-be destroyer of humanity as insecure. When he finally goes mano a mano with Xavier at the climax its in a psychic battle staged inside the latters dreamspace which happens to look exactly like his mansion. In recent months both Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice and Captain America Civil War have offered up big flashy superhero standoffs as feuds of ideology and stubborn will. Apocalypse which looks and moves more like a comic book than either of those movies says ""no thanks"" to all that and instead delivers borderline-psychedelic displays of super-powered insecurity. The X-Men films have made an explicit connection between the mutants powers and pubescent self-discovery but perhaps its necessary to address the last few movies psychosexual subtext. The Xavier-Magneto conflict ostensibly ideological basically comes down to worries about inadequacy and masculine ego. Magneto virile has fathered more children than he even knows about in the Apocalypse timeline; he wears a purple helmet that is--lets face it-- kind of phallic and his signature move is to rise slowly into the air. Xavier--first seen as an adult in First Class trying to pick up a woman in a bar--is impotent at least metaphorically and will eventually see all of his luxuriant hair fall out. He fills his mansion with surrogate children. He is also a voyeur using his supercomputer Cerebro to peer around the globe. (The good professor does all this out of a wheelchair for maximum Rear Window effect.) These two men compete by reproducing--both literally and figuratively as with so much in the movie--and by trying to win over a figure of all things feminine straight out of the dank recesses of the misogynist imagination an unpredictable ageless shape-shifter named Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Occasionally they cross paths with the ideal of pure hirsute manhood that is Hugh Jackmans Wolverine. Here they are confronted with the threat of ICBMs being launched by the United States and the USSR and with Apocalypse who reproduces asexually moving his consciousness into a new body when necessary. Apocalypse also happens to be a Fagin figure shuffling around the back alleys of Cairo where he makes the weather-controlling pickpocket Storm (Alexandra Shipp) his first follower by offering her baubles. Just to make it clear what Singer and his team are going for John Ottmans opening credits march is arranged to sound exactly like the theme music from Tobe Hoopers 1985 space-sex-vampire flick Lifeforce. The key ingredient of Singers X-Men movies (X-Men X2 X-Men United X-Men Days Of Future Past) is that they approach super-powers as power fantasies; theres no moment in the cultural-conversation-saturating Marvel Cinematic Universe that comes close to Days Of Future Pasts ""Time In A Bottle"" slow-motion sequence or even the older Magnetos escape from a plastic prison in X2. In Apocalypse extravagant effects cross lines of reality to express fears and desires Magneto tears apart Auschwitz using the bricks of the concentration camp to build an impossible futuristic cityscape of archways; Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) dressed in a red-and-black Thriller jacket teleports away as every awkward teenager wishes they could; Quicksilver (Evan Peters) still living at his own slacker-ish pace in his moms basement stops time to save bystanders eat pizza and listen to the Eurythmics. In the comics Apocalypse has the power to change size. Here he can only do so in Xaviers dreams.But much of what makes X-Men Apocalypse legitimately interesting also makes it frustrating and lopsided since Singer and screenwriter-producer Simon Kinberg remain committed to the structure of an overlong comic-book blockbuster complete with a climax in which the world has to be saved using as many different colors of energy beam as possible. That means handing over much of business of moving the plot to Mystique and to a group of youngsters that includes Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and the aforementioned Nightcrawler. Its here that the movie series longstanding inability to create female characters as fleshed-out and conflicted as its men gets thrown into stark relief. However the globe-trotting--which takes the movie from suburban malls to Eastern German underground clubs--gives Singer and Kinberg a chance to indulge their taste for period references be it a well-timed Ms. Pac-Man sound effect or a discussion of Return Of The Jedi that lets the series take yet another kick at Brett Ratners little-loved X-Men The Last Stand.

Technically this is co-writer and director Bryan Singers sequel to his own time-travelling X-Men Days of Future Past from 2014. That also makes it the last instalment in the X-Men reboot trilogy that began with Matthew Vaughns X-Men First Class from 2011 a title which Singer co-wrote and co-produced. Intellectually the film introduces the god-like ""Apocalypse"" as the worlds most ancient mutant in a sequence that takes place in 3600 BCE resurrects him in modern times and pits him against Charles Xavier and his mutant students and friends in 1983. The complex cut-and-thrust reminds us why mutant and ""normal"" human beings have difficulty trusting one another and co-existing. Emotionally the film features a great story that survives despite an overwrought running time of 144 minutes some substandard special effects that degrade the overall visual impact and overplayed fight scenes that get too repetitive. Finally using Singers own word this is the ""true"" origins of the X-Men as a cohesive fighting unit that possesses more collective power than the Avengers. The film chronicles how many of the most familiar X-Men enhance and harness their powers from Jean Grey to Cyclops Storm Nightcrawler Quicksilver and even Wolverine (although his participation in this new-old story is incidental if pivotal for other mutants). The basis for this film and the entire X-Men franchise is of course the Marvel comic book series launched by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in September of 1963. Lee makes his usual cameo this time as an American suburbanite showing shock-and-awe when the sky fills with nuclear missiles. Core actors reprise their roles from First Class and Days of Future Past among them the excellent James McAvoy as Charles Xavier/Professor X. I personally believe that McAvoys humanity as well as his considerable skill as an actor makes the supernatural nonsense palatable and even real. The same mindtrick applies to the appearance of Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto whom Michael Fassbender again plays as a superhuman man tortured by his very human past in the Holocaust by a fresh new tragedy and by his confusion about his place in the world. His relationship to McAvoys Professor X remains in turmoil and humanitys fate hangs in the balance. Everyone else does his or her job well creating a solid ensemble of returning actors and fresh faces. The roster includes Jennifer Lawrence as Raven Darkholme/Mystique; Nicholas Hoult as Hank McCoy/Beast; Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers/Cyclops; Alexandra Shipp as Ororo Munroe/Storm; Evan Peters as Peter Maximoff/Quicksilver; Kodi Smit-McPhee as Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler; Olivia Munn as Elizabeth Braddock/Psylocke; Ben Hardy as Warren Worthington III/Archangel; Josh Helman as the still-stubborn U.S. military moron William Stryker; Rose Bryne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert plus assorted other support players. Special attention goes to Sophie Turner as Jean Grey in her coming-out party as a powerhouse; Hugh Jackman as Wolverine in his bloody emergence as a feral beast; and Oscar Isaac who forsakes the Rebellion in Star Wars The Force Awakens to embrace his Dark Side as the uber-villain from X-Men mythology. Isaac gives this rather routine ""monster"" so much human personality that the terror increases tenfold while Apocalypse tries to live up to his name. That brings us back to Singer who directed the first X-Men in 2000. Piece by piece Singer fits this ninth film in the franchise (which includes Deadpool) into the X-Men universe like a master puzzle maker. He does it so well at least in terms of storytelling that the X-Men franchise still has a vigorous future. X-Men Apocalypse opens May 27.

Entertainment New ""X-Men"" Movie Is Its Own Apocalypse The very crowded new X-Men installment wastes last years breakout actor in a terminally silly role. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jennifer Lawrence and Oscar Isaac in X-Men Apocalypse. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 8637166 X-Men Apocalypse gives you a glimpse of Oscar Isaac bare-chested bald and beautiful in its opening flashback in Egypt in 3600 BCE.Its a tease. A minute later the blue powers of its title villain ne En Sabah Nur seep inside of him and take him over as part of a consciousness-transferring body-snatching procedure and Isaac spends the rest of the movie encased in blue makeup and bewildering motivations as he seeks to remake the world and reappoint himself as its god.Isaac isnt the only big name to have been woven into the franchise -- Apocalypse like the two previous movies flounders at giving Jennifer Lawrence (way more famous now than when she appeared in 2011s X-Men First Class) more non-blue screen time and a place of prominence. But Isaacs appearance in the film seems a particular waste after he proved himself so resoundingly last year as both an actor and a heartthrob. Its not just that you can barely see Isaac; its that Apocalypse is such an incredible letdown as a foe with his fixation on being worshipped the amount of time he spends recruiting an entourage and frankly the micromanaging attention he gives his henchmens various new looks. View this image > Michael Fassbender Alan Markfield / 20th Century Fox ID 8637209 For an ancient antagonist reaching back to the dawn of time -- the first mutant The baddest bad to have ever badded -- Apocalypse is neither frightening nor memorable aside from the way he personally applies the facial decal on one of his four followers. After emerging in 1983 following millennia of being buried underground Apocalypse catches up on the current status of the planet by absorbing it through a television. ""Learrrning"" he groans like a very drunk Leeloo from The Fifth Element. Getting to the ""war part"" he likes it and he decides unworthy humans have been in charge for too long and its time for him to put mutants back on top. He turns people into sand. Hes camp but the rest of the movie isnt -- the rest of the movie tries to parcel out earnest angst to its many many characters leaning on recognition from past X-Men installments to give them a wholeness that the film doesnt have time to fill out itself.The biggest recipient is Magneto (Michael Fassbender) whos gone to ground since Days of Future Past hiding in Eastern Europe married with a daughter and a factory job. That life is taken from him abruptly and awfully in what is essentially a police shooting after he outs himself as a mutant by saving someone at work. Its one of the few instances of regular ol humanity in the movie and its only in the context of a character careening back to wanting to destroy it. Fassbender is the tormented heart of the X-Men prequels imbuing his character with soulful tragedy (and still giving the best ""Im using my superpowers"" grimace in the business) but he struggles to bring freshness to Magnetos latest cycle of destroy/remorse in this sequel even when he levels Auschwitz with new Apocalypse-issued strength. Its a scene that should be audacious but instead is a shrug the wreckage spiraling prettily into the air -- his powers are bigger but not more meaningful. View this image > Sophie Turner Kodi Smit-McPhee and Tye Sheridan. 20th Century Fox ID 8637219 Apocalypse director Bryan Singers always had a way with the beats between the action the ones that made mutantism such an all-purpose stand-in for the targets of intolerance -- Icemans ""coming out"" to his parents in X2; Rogues fear that her own body and sexuality were deadly in the X-Men world when her first kiss sent someone into a coma; Mystique spitting about how ""people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child""; Magnetos powers rumbling to life in that Nazi concentration camp. But in Apocalypse the ""youre with us or against us"" of it all is as abstract as that scene of Magneto vowing a new genocide while obliterating the site of a past one. The baby mutants -- like Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) -- have little interaction with the outside world after their introductions. In the big finish were given flashes of some worried faces in a war room to provide a reminder of the mostly offscreen stakes of the battle.Apocalypse focuses on mutant-on-mutant action with Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Quicksilver (Evan Peters once again getting the best scene in the movie) Mystique (Lawrence looking uncharacteristically at sea) and Xavier (James McAvoy) on one side and Apocalypse and his horsemen Angel (Ben Hardy) Storm (Alexandra Shipp) Psylocke (Olivia Munn weakest of the bunch) and Magneto on the other. But Apocalypse is so silly and his actions are so lacking the pained resonance of past movies clashes -- that fundamental schism over whats best for mutantkind -- that it hardly matters. They fight and some change their mind and for some it wasnt clear why they were fighting in the first place. Like Oscar Isaac in that first scene Apocalypse loses its humanity early on and never figures out what to replace it with.

Photo Twentieth Century Fox Associated Press Image 14 of 14 X-Men Apocalypse a thinking persons action movie 1 / 14 Back to Gallery This is turning into the season of superheroes battling other superheroes but ""X-Men Apocalypse"" is the first one to do it right. One of the best of the ""X-Men"" films the new entry is full of finely crafted action all of it in the service of interesting and well-thought-out ideas. Resting on neither formula nor audience goodwill the ""X-Men"" series is going deeper and getting better as it goes along. The first title card -- 3600 B.C.E. -- brings a mild feeling of oh-no-must-we-go-there but this evaporates virtually from the first shot as we realize that director Bryan Singer intends to do this for real. For a little pre-credits sequence he re-creates ancient Egypt -- not just a little room somewhere in Egypt. He shows us a parade where we can see the opulence of the era and the pyramids when they were new and the faces of the slaves. The idea at work here is that the Egyptian rulers were actually the first mutants and that the top ruler -- known as Apocalypse so you know hes not nice -- had the ultimate power. By inhabiting the bodies of a series of mutants he has maintained his youth and acquired multiple abilities. But then theres a mishap and Apocalypse is rendered unconscious which is a very good thing for the course of civilization. Singer illustrates the passage of time from ancient days through the late 20th century by catapulting the viewer through a twisting corridor in which we see glimpses of the crucifixion Renaissance art the rise of Nazism and the emergence of the Cold War. Finally we arrive in the promising era of the 1980s. Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has all his hair as well as a school for mutants. And Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is living happily and anonymously as a family man and factory worker in Poland. So everything is going along swimmingly ... and then Apocalypse wakes up. Every action movie needs a villain but not just any old villain with a vague desire to take over the world or cause destruction or take revenge. A villain needs a rationale a philosophy a highly developed conviction that hes right as well some twisted logic that lets us understand how hes thinking. He also needs some personal magnetism so that we can understand why others might follow him. Through the script and through Oscar Isaacs performance we get that in Apocalypse. Apocalypse has an idea which was something like Hitlers idea that the strong should dominate. So when he puts on his hood and steps out of his cave he is repulsed. Instead of a world in which the strong are in control he sees systems in place that protect the weak. To his eyes the weak are dominating the strong to him the ultimate perversity. So he has only one logical course to figure out a way to destroy absolutely everything and start all over. More reviews Captain America Civil War When the good guys cant get along High-Rise is weird imaginative and almost good Binoche gives a great performance in LAttesa Apocalypse recruits mutants but theyre best left to be discovered. Its how Apocalypse does it thats worth noting. He tells the mutants he chooses that he wants to make them stronger and then he does. In the case of Psylocke a quasi-dominatrix mutant played by Olivia Munn he tells her ""Unlike others who seek to control you I seek to set you free."" Hes going to make her great again and its a beautiful thing. As in ""Captain America Civil War"" we soon have two teams of individuals each with what could be called super powers fighting each other. But ""Civil War"" gave us a weak situation in which no one was wrong little was at stake and the consequences were mild. ""X-Men Apocalypse"" by contrast goes for broke. Civilization is at stake and both sides are trying to kill each other. In most superhero movies trying to kill each other would mean scenes of characters throwing each other around. But ""X-Men Apocalypse"" is smarter than that with the most important battles taking place inside the minds of Apocalypse and Charles Xavier. Xaviers mental capacity to communicate with everyone on the planet seems almost like a metaphor for the Internet here. To succeed tyrants need that final piece complete control over communications. Jennifer Lawrence is such a strong presence that its only when the movie is over that one realizes that her character Mystique serves a secondary function here. The movies focus is mainly fixed on Charles and Magneto and the evolution of their worldview. Their stories echo and reverberate. They seem to mean more than whats simply on the surface. They are the best argument for ""X-Men Apocalypse"" as a thinking persons action movie. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

VPCCyclops (Tye Sheridan) and Jean (Sophie Turner) battle bad guys in X-Men Apocalypse.(Photo 20th Century Fox)The latest in the X-Men movie franchise is just X-meh.An end-of-the-world scenario makes for big-budget action/adventure but a lackluster story in X-Men Apocalypse ( out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters nationwide May 27). Director Bryan Singer made more hay with Marvels mighty mutant menagerie in the early 2000s but the new film comes undone with too many characters and not enough nuance or freshness. (Deadpool is the best X-Men effort this year. Who saw that coming?)Apocalypse continues the story started in X-Men First Class (2011) and X-Men Days of Future Past (2014). The title villain -- the worlds first mutant played in over-the-top fashion by Oscar Isaac -- has risen from his pyramid tomb in 1983 to scorch the Earth and rule a new world. To do so hes rounded up his Four Horsemen including the tragic antihero Magneto (Michael Fassbender).Magnetos old friend Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is running a school for gifted young mutants but the main protagonist seems to be the shape-shifting blue-skinned Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who pretty much looks like Jennifer Lawrence most of the time and rarely appears in her mutant guise.USA TODAYHow to get in X-Men movie shape like Jennifer LawrenceThe movie is scattered in whether it wants to focus on the old kids like Xavier and Mystique or go all-in with the rookie class led by Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) whose eyes shoot some serious laser blasts and the telekinetic Jean Grey (Sophie Turner). When Apocalypse enacts the final phase of his nefarious plans and nabs Xavier the new crew plays an integral role in the explosive though way-too-long end battle.No doubt 2016 will go down as The Year Superheroes Beat Each Other to a Pulp and Apocalypse pits pals against pals too though only the complicated relationship between Magneto and Xavier gives the movie any gravitas (credit to Fassbender and McAvoy) amid the eye-candy destruction.The symbolic civil-rights struggle that marked the other movies is mostly thrown to the side and instead theres much more attention paid to fan service such as figuring out ways to make Xavier his well-known bald self or get Weapon X into the picture. (Hint The role is played by an A-lister with impressive sets of claws and mutton chops.)USA TODAYHow Olivia Munn mastered swordplay for X-Men ApocalypseEven at two and a half hours theres not enough screen time for the jam-packed ensemble so Apocalypses minions Storm (Alexandra Shipp) Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and Angel (Ben Hardy) unfortunately get shorted.Yet Evan Peters speedster Quicksilver -- the highlight of Future Past -- gets ample time to strut his super-stuff. A visual-effects treat just with his retro wardrobe the fleet-footed guy saves dozens from a burning school and even has the time for Tab during a superbly crafted sequence set to Eurythmics.Turner best known as Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones also has a strong turn as Jean. She shows personality as well as an unbridled power thats seeded for later cinematic episodes.""We can all agree that the third one is usually the worst"" says Jean coming out of a showing of Return of the Jedi and when it comes to this recent trio of X-Men movies shes not wrong. 570 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 39 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/279npl1",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/09/review-x-men-apocalypse-movie/84163328/,200,x-men35,x-men,usatoday

It involves a raid by some Polish officers in the remote forest where Erik Lehnsherr a/k/a Magneto (Michael Fassbender) -- the powerful mutant antihero and sometimes villain of this series -- has been living incognito with his wife and young daughter. Magneto can control metal so the men wear no badges and carry no guns. They come under cover of night carrying bows and arrows and the resulting subdued face-off -- full of silent glances hesitant actions and ultimately tragic consequences -- serves as a reminder that the makers of comic-book blockbusters dont have to abandon subtlety character performance and film grammar completely. After the Everythings-a-Metaphor sledgehammering of Batman v. Superman and the jokey flab of Captain America Civil War Singers film feels like something somewhat rare an actual superhero movie. EXPAND Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox Film Details X-Men Apocalypse RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time145 min. More Info Trailer Its not that X-Men Apocalypse is itself a quiet film. In some ways its brasher louder and more cartoonish than any comic-book flick in recent memory. The success of the first X-Men back in 2000 helped kick off the current craze and this new one still carries some of those earlier films embrace of colorful weirdness grand gestures and melodramatic dialogue. (Just think while everyone else tries to make their heroes costumes darker more au courant more bad-ass Apocalypse set in the 1980s has the gall to let one character sport a Michael Jackson ""Thriller"" jacket throughout.) EXPAND Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox The film even starts off with a nutty elaborate Egyptian prologue involving human sacrifice levitating sarcophagi gravity-defying spurts of gold and collapsing pyramids before plunging headlong into a credits sequence in which notable symbols of world history -- Jesus on the cross The Twin Towers A Swastika - come flying at us in 3-D. The plot involves the awakening of a villain called Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac his soulful face caked in thick makeup and ornate headgear) an ancient all-powerful Egyptian being who can by transferring his consciousness absorb the abilities of all other mutants. Having discovered that humanity has become soft and weak during the 6000 years that hes been asleep Apocalypse decides to do away with the world and start anew. (""Where did you come from?"" ""A time before man lost his way."" ""Well welcome to the Eighties."") His first victims a group of Cairo hoodlums that he beheads softly with a handful of dust and another man he just as gently turns into a wall; the offhandedness of his villainy is both ridiculous and chilling. EXPAND Alan Markfield Apocalypse nabs X-Men leader Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and seizes his fancy global mutant-tracking system. The bad guys aim is to use Xaviers technology to transfer his consciousness all over the world and to control the other mutants -- particularly the uniquely powerful Magneto who as usual is torn between good and evil between his wounded psyche and desire for justice. A group of Xaviers students -- including shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) teleporting Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) telepath Jean Grey (Sophie Turner) and powerful-eye-beam-thingamabob-shooter Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) -- join forces to rescue their leader. On Apocalypses side at least for now are another cadre of young mutants including the weather-controlling Storm (Alexandra Shipp) the high-flying Angel (Ben Hardy) and the slicing dicing Psylocke (Oliva Munn). Thats a lot of individuals and superpowers -- theres even a non-mutant Xaviers former flame and now-amnesiac CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) thrown into the mix -- but the scripts focus on teamwork and its clear delineation of characters makes it easy to keep up. Even though Apocalypse is filled with cities being destroyed much of the action reminded me of nothing so much as a classic Mission Impossible episode where each member of the team gets a chance to do their thing. EXPAND Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox This makes emotional sense too The particular genius of the X-Men films has always been the way they followed their characters journeys of self-acceptance. (Its no great secret that while the original comics were inspired partly by the civil rights struggle of the 1960s the earlier films have made clear nods to the gay rights movement.) But here these young characters in part because theyve spent childhoods living in shame and in part because theyre still often unable to control their abilities are sometimes torn over whether to use their powers. That lends even the most basic action sequence surprising levels of both suspense and (gasp) humanity so much so that even the films dated-looking and occasionally tacky special effects -- complete with awkwardly-floating-dudes and magic light-shows -- arent particularly distracting. Its further proof that movies like these work better when theyre about people instead of pyrotechnics. EXPAND Courtesy of Twentieth Century Fox What makes X-Men Apocalypse so exciting isnt really any one thing but rather its cohesion its storytelling verve. Where other recent superhero films have struggled to jam-pack their unwieldy plots with characters and incident and meaning this film nimbly mixes narrative exuberance and emotional depth flamboyant displays of power with quietly terrifying exchanges. It zips along combining the highs and lows of a real comic book -- all the feeling color and wonder even some of the dopiness -- with gloriously cinematic storytelling.

If youve seen one cinematic apocalypse youve seen them all. At least thats the feeling conjured by ""X-Men Apocalypse"" the latest entry in one of the more reliable comic-book franchises around this time disappointingly succumbing to an exhausting case of been-there-done-that-itis. Director Bryan Singer pioneered the contemporary wave of superhero movies with 2000s ""X-Men"" and made a welcome return to the series just two years ago with the time-jumping ""Days of Future Past."" Perhaps he shouldve quit while he was ahead. Even though ""Apocalypse"" hardly reps the franchise nadir (an in-joke midway through this 80s-set pic throws deserved shade at Brett Ratners woeful ""X-Men The Last Stand"" as one character exits ""Return of the Jedi"" and laments ""the third ones always the worst"") this is easily the least compelling surprising and satisfying of Singers entries. While the best ""X-Men"" movies are defined by their keen intelligence casual wit and deep reserves of emotion (with an affinity for social commentary bordering on Very Special Episode territory) ""Apocalypse"" serves those virtues up in minimal doses settling for an extravagant display of visual effects that would have scarcely been possible 16 years ago. That should be enough to secure robust box office overseas but domestic results could fall notably short of ""Future Pasts"" sterling 234 million gross. The wildcard in audience acceptance (and the box office ceiling) for this latest outing is the lack of fan favorite character Wolverine (at least as far as viewers know). The genetically-modified man of wars absence from Matthew Vaughns well-reviewed prequel ""X-Men First Class"" was blamed for that films relatively underwhelming performance. Follow-up ""Future Past"" mixed cast members from both ""First Class"" and the original ""X-Men"" trilogy including Hugh Jackmans hirsute hero but ""Apocalypse"" returns to the core ""Class"" ensemble of James McAvoy (as Professor Charles Xavier) Michael Fassbender (as his frenemy Erik Lensherr a.k.a. Magneto) Jennifer Lawrence (as shapeshifter Raven/Mystique) Nicholas Hoult (as brainy and brawny Hank McCoy) and Rose Byrne (as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert). Related Bryan Singer on Deadpool in the X-Men Universe Competing with Marvel and DC That lineup isnt short on talent or charisma and the addition of series newcomers Oscar Isaac (as titular mega-mutant baddie Apocalypse) Tye Sheridan Sophie Turner and Kodi Smit-McPhee (as younger incarnations of the original trilogy characters Cyclops Jean Grey and Nightcrawler respectively) only bolsters the ensembles appeal. Except this time Singer and scribe Simon Kinberg give the players precious little to sink their teeth into. From the opening prologue set in the Nile Valley circa 3600 BC its clear that Singer aims to take audiences on an eye-popping roller-coaster ride though in doing so he leaves behind any pretense of coherent storytelling or character development as an aging Apocalypse prepares to transfer into a younger body with the help of four devoted minions. The character narrowly pulls it off as the massive pyramid he had constructed crumbles spectacularly around him killing his followers and entombing him for the next several thousand years. The film skips ahead to an Ohio high school classroom in 1983 where life is literally a blur for young Scott Summers (a.k.a. Cyclops winningly played by Terrence Malick discovery Sheridan). His vision is starting to go and after a rage-fueled encounter with a class bully unleashes a powerful laser beam from his peepers Scott is whisked away to Professor Xaviers school for ""gifted"" kids by big brother Alex (Lucas Till another ""First Class"" holdover). Thats where McCoy takes Scott under his wing and (shades of Anna Paquins Rogue in ""X-Men"") the young mutant is introduced to a world where he can finally be himself -- not to mention find a simpatico soul in Turners blossoming telekinetic heroine. Several other key characters -- including Raven Nightcrawler MacTaggert and Evan Peters scene-stealing Quicksilver -- each make their way to the school in due time. A parallel storyline tracks Apocalypses 20th-century resurrection and subsequent recruitment of four new followers African orphan Ororo (Alexandra Shipp) fierce Psylocke (Olivia Munn) winged outcast Angel (Ben Hardy) and Magneto who has been quietly living under an assumed identity in Poland since his failed attempt to assassinate President Nixon in ""Future Past."" Related Jennifer Lawrence Is Dying to Make More X-Men Movies Despite a handful of references to President Reagan and the Cold War ""Apocalypse"" steers clear of 80s politics and instead leans on familiar pop culture references (""Knight Rider"" a Ms. Pac-Man arcade game) and smartly utilized contempo music cues. Metallicas ""The Four Horsemen"" scores a wounded Angels rebirth via Apocalypse and Eurythmics ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"" accompanies an elaborate sequence of Quicksilver slowing down time to rescue Professor Xs students from an explosion. (Its meant to outdo the ""Time in a Bottle"" sequence from ""Future Past"" but only reinforces what an ingenious and singular way Singer found to demonstrate Quicksilvers power the first time around.) Professor Xs school isnt the only thing that blows up in the ruination-happy ""Apocalypse"" but the storytelling never ignites. Apocalypse remains a one-note villain throughout despite Isaacs best efforts to imbue the godlike foe with authoritative menace underneath mountains of prosthetic makeup (whatever new fans the exceptional actor gained from ""Star Wars The Force Awakens"" will hardly recognize him here). The back-and-forth between Xavier (in the ""mutants and humans can live together"" camp) and Magneto (in the ""mutants and humans can never live together"" camp) has grown increasingly tired over six films even if were now witnessing a midpoint in their relationship. Similarly Ravens mixed feelings about becoming a role model for mutants everywhere after saving the president in ""Future Past"" is ho-hum stuff several notches below Lawrences formidable skill level. Although the ""X-Men"" ensembles are usually large there are simply too many characters for the action-heavy ""Apocalypse"" to properly juggle. Its easy to forget even McAvoy or Fassbender when theyre off screen for too long and the film functions best when it lets the fresh young trio of Sheridan Turner and Smit-McPhee take center stage. Still its Peters who emerges as the cast standout in just a handful of scenes by bringing an offbeat sensibility to a production that otherwise plays campy cartoon material a little too straight. ""X-Men Apocalypse"" certainly represents a high level of Hollywood craftsmanship from Grant Majors imposing production design in sequences set across multiple continents to Louise Mingenbachs multifarious costumes (some lifted directly from comic-book pages including Munns skimpy skintight garb). Regular Singer d.p. Newton Thomas Sigels contributions are seemingly enhanced by the work of visual effects designer John Dykstra in nearly every shot but Singers steadfast editor-composer John Ottman once again delivers on his double duty somehow finding a way (with fellow editor Michael Louis Hill) to zip between a multitude of storylines without drawing attention to the cuts and scoring the action in a galvanizing but never overpowering fashion.

Marcus McLean says June 11 2016 at 907 pm What are the name of Professor Xaviers sunglasses he wore when he first met Cyclops in the the beginning of Xmen Apocalypse? I love those frames and i want to get a pair. Reply Ebony-Nicole says June 23 2016 at 919 am Wish I knew. I liked them as well. Reply Jeff Sonnefield says June 5 2016 at 150 pm On the contrary. This was my favorite X-men movie. I will say I am biased because Apocalypse is my favorite character. I think they portrayed Apocalypse perfectly. Granted there were probably too many characters in the movie to fully give adequate time but over all my favorite of the series. Also...quicksilver was hilarious. Reply ntm says May 30 2016 at 1232 am is it me or are you just a hater of every movie you watch and review? are you actually hating for a living? Reply Cedric says May 27 2016 at 1139 am When this reviewer said Quicksilver slowed down time it tells me how qualified they are to do the review. Fans of the comic will love the movie. Reply Daniel says May 26 2016 at 840 pm So far out of all the terrible reviews Ive read about this film this one is the crappiest. This film was amazing and if people are going to write reviews like this one and ignore the time and effort put into this film then read the comics and go make your own version Reply beforeandafter20 says May 25 2016 at 1030 pm If youve seen all the X-Men movies (and its spinoffs) youll prolly get a little confused by some of the things that happened in Apocalypse. Theyre quite minute tho so wont prolly notice most of them. Apocalypse is not a bad movie. It just seems like the studio is trying so hard to make money out of the franchise (lol capitalism lol). Reply Jonny says May 25 2016 at 1212 pm Too many characters for this pea brain movie reviewer. I cant wait till these reviewers are a thing of the past. That way we can enjoy films without people telling us what to watch. Reply Gan Han Sing says May 21 2016 at 708 am Id just watched the movie and I think it was a pretty good movie. The guy who review this movie is obviously one of those guys who did not like superheroes movie... and obviously went into the movie with a vendetta... missing the point of the story and dismissing it as a ""an eye-popping roller-coaster ride"". Stop being a hater man.. Reply samir says May 22 2016 at 1111 pm U Marvel Fanboys are such soore losers this same shiet happened with age of ultron if if was bad it was bad Cant u pple just accept that? The trailer gave us more action than the actual movie did plus half of the movie was basically mystique recruiting. it was a good movie yes but there was nothing special or amazing about it. Reply Corey Ebadat says May 20 2016 at 1017 am X-man without Wolverine is like superman without Kent clark. Reply Navi7 says May 20 2016 at 303 am Apocalypse has happened because people are spending time on writing and reading reviews than actually having a real experience -_- Reply Martyn french says May 19 2016 at 1224 am Are you joking? Marvel is all about characters its about having loads of people and about explaining their story more... I sat next to a couple who brought there kids and they didnt know a few of the characters to see their faces light up when they started to learn more about it was amazing Characters bring the films to life in marvel never to many X men will never die there is too many options to go down critics these days I have no clue what you want when a film is full of action and fun and story you all say "" too much special fxs"" shut up if I wanted to see a film with less special effects id watch the notebook. Need to update critics as lately theyve made shocking comments about many films that have been great to watch and Ive even watched over again Reply Will says May 11 2016 at 115 pm Might want to update the subtitle seeing as Bryan Singer has only done three X-Men films. Reply JP says May 12 2016 at 117 pm it is his fourth movie and should be his last Reply Klein says May 11 2016 at 840 am DoFP has more mutants than this one and this one is ""packed with many characters""? WTF is that.. Charles and Erik has that same hate-love relationship in the comics for like ever and it just shows it here how it is. Reply samuelammons says May 10 2016 at 1129 am ""elaborate sequence of Quicksilver slowing down time to rescue"" Quicksilver doesnt slow down time. Relativity. Hes moving so fast the world seems to stop. Reply Lance says May 10 2016 at 1219 am Not surprised This movie has looked awful from the first trailer. Reply K Liu says May 9 2016 at 1124 pm bla bla bla...dont be a loser u know nothing about X-Men...2 thumbs down for u... Reply stikman32000 says May 10 2016 at 529 am Then they have something in common with Bryan Singer Reply Jimmy says May 9 2016 at 1110 pm All of these points could be leveled at Civil War but some critics are giving it a free pass. Other studios are allowed to make superhero films like Fox and DC. Sometimes they are even better than Marvel films. Civil War was good but it was kind of underwhelming and extreme slow and boring at times. The first 45 minutes dont really work until they go to London. The first action scene was boring and amatur hour. Reply Rex says May 10 2016 at 818 am Listen up everyone. Jimmy has spoken. We can all arrive at the theatre 45 minutes after Civil War actually starts Hooray Horray for Jimmy Reply nathanial says May 9 2016 at 1109 pm So let me get this straight. Everyone has said of previous X-Men films "" there are more mutants and stories than just Wolverine and his happy gang of mutant buddies"" Now we a get a movie that is not Wolverine and those mutants way over there and its a flop because there are too many characters to juggle? LMAO "" its the same ole charles vs magnetos view of mutant kind again..."" Thats exactly what the X-men are. It was a creation to tackle the social struggles of racism and diversity in our world and the views of two powerful leaders at a time of great social strife. Xavier was fashioned after Dr. Martin Luther King and Magneto was fashioned after Malcolm X. Of course the core of the X-men universe is about those twos struggles of inclusion versus radicalism. Ultimately the X-men does not translate well to the silver screen because some of the depth of the real life issues that are tackled in the stories cant just be captured by mouth breathers who dont readthe books and just want to pay their 12 dollars and be entertained for 2 hours. And the ones that love the stories from their childhood will always be disappointed by the lackluster creation that gets forced on the screen and judged by how much money it can make. Reply Klein says May 11 2016 at 843 am Finally someone said it. Reply Marcus Thomas says May 11 2016 at 1201 pm I hear what your saying but X-men movies has only really been done by Brian singer. Of course other directors have been on but only Matthew V has done a good job with an X men movie. Point being. If it was put in the right hangs I think X-men could differently translate well over to the silver screen. Just needs a fresh approach completely different to singers version. Cindy says May 9 2016 at 820 pm Magneto didnt try to assassinate Nixon he was accused and sentenced for killing Kennedy in Future Past. Get the facts right or the whole review is less credible. Just saying Reply Klein says May 11 2016 at 842 am PREACH Reply Cindy says May 9 2016 at 825 pm Oh gosh I forgot about Nixon Disregard my previous comment. I apologize. Reply crossie says May 9 2016 at 648 pm So I dont think the superhero bubble has burst so much as it was actually a balloon all along and were now watching the second year of it deflating. This is going to be another box office ""disappointment"". Its kind of weird to call things that make hundreds of millions of dollars in a couple days ""disappointments"" but its true. ""Avengers 2 Age of Ultron"" will win the summer handily ... oh wait it got beat. ""BvS"" is going to start up yet another cinematic superhero universe; but you know get its butt handed to it by a Disney cartoon not even Disney had any confidence in to the point they were selling it to the freaking furry fandom in the hope someone would watch it but ended up actually being good and unique so the movie going public showed some taste there. Meanwhile this weekend has seen ""Civil War"" go from ""its going to pass 200 million"" to ""well okay just 180 million thats still pretty high"" to ""well Sunday was off because it faced stiffer competition FROM FRICKIN MOTHERS DAY than expected."" So whats the first superhero mega-flop? This? ""Dr. Strange?"" ""Suicide Squad?"" Reply shadowsleuth1989 says May 9 2016 at 635 pm Not surprising. I suspected Singer was going to lean on a lot of pop culture but when it comes down to it the X-Men films are very repetitive. Singer may present the story in different wrapping papers but story-wise you can practically line up the prequel trilogy with the original trilogy piece by piece. Dont know what all this talk is about formidable skills on Lawrences part. Shes playing the same thing she plays in every film. The emotionally lost know-it-all who doesnt want to change and freaks out the minute anyone tells her otherwise. Its just in the X-Men films she plays a character that demands subtly (Sadly the former model was a better Mystique than her) and Lawrence cant do subtly. And no staring off-camera for 20 minutes in every film is not subtly its lazy. But back to the point of the film Singer and Fox dont plan things out. First of all they let us know at the end of Days of Future Past that everyone is alive and well in our time long after ""Apocalypse"" takes place. This removes dramatic heft and almost felt like maybe Singer was trying to end the series but then Fox said ""No no. Leave it open for more."" so they added that end-credits scene. Another is Singer doesnt embrace his characters uniqueness. Hes done the same formula he did in the original trilogy where you have a lead character focused on and the only really character development is a love triangle that is used in the story. Thats disappointing. I remember watching ""The Wolverine"" and hoping they explored his tragedies there. I mean some of the stuff from the comics is so sad and character-defining. And apparently ""Apocalypse"" is getting shredded in reviews. I hope that Fox realizes from stories like ""Deadpool"" that to adapt the comics...embrace the material for crying out loud If youre going to take material from a source then use it Reply Jim says May 9 2016 at 506 pm ANOTHER paid off disney critic what a surprise. I just love how ever Disney/Marvel film is conveniently perfect for critics and all others that are not owned by disney are rated a lot harsher....very interesting how that works what a coincidence. Reply Roose says May 10 2016 at 1028 am This is tracking under 50% on Rotten Tomatoes with 36 reviews counted. This review is not an outlier. The movie appears to be subpar at best. Reply Silas says May 9 2016 at 727 pm Why did critics give Foxs Deadpool such good reviews? Reply Jas says May 9 2016 at 713 pm So youve seen the movie then? Its not out yet. Reply John says May 9 2016 at 505 pm Batman V.S. Superman was an awful movie. AWFUL. AWFUL. AWFUL. Reply JR says May 9 2016 at 640 pm Um...no .. Reply Matt says May 9 2016 at 318 pm Civil War was the most derivative superhero movie of the summer yet it received good reviews. Now it appears critics are becoming just as derivative in their critiques of all superhero movies made by studios other than Disney. The movie critic industry is losing its integrity. I dont trust a word of any of it. Ill make up my own mind. Hopefully Civil War crashes and burns in Week 2 so there arent anymore love fest articles about it. Reply daniel says May 10 2016 at 1211 am Bitter DC fantard alert Batman vs Superman SUCKED Get over it Reply EricJ says May 9 2016 at 329 pm Yeah a sudden flood of good reviews mean more ""Marvel Conspiracy"" right Bat-boy? Look youre GETTING your Justice League movie and your Wonder Woman and Warners finally letting Ben Affleck direct the others instead of Snyder; you can knock off the Trump-rally Cap-bashing now... That said its hard to look at the Apocalypse photos without making the same Peter Boyle/Young Frankenstein jokes every other Marvel fan has been making....Fox does certainly plan to be ""puddin onda riiiizz"" Reply tlsnyder42 says May 9 2016 at 310 pm Wrong Reply Chizz says May 9 2016 at 241 pm Steer clear of politics and lean on pop culture. In a nutshell this is why 97% of Hollywood movies suck. Reply See All 41 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Divorce Marks Sarah Jessica Parkers Return To HBO But...

Daily Edition Login to download X-Men Apocalypse Film Review 200 PM PDT 5/9/2016 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS More is less in this bulging franchise entry. TWITTER 5/27/2016 The X-Men unite to fight the worlds first mutant in the latest Bryan Singer-directed entry in the series starring Michael Fassbender Oscar Isaac and Jennifer Lawrence. Both Captain America Civil War and X-Men Apocalypse are superhero extravaganzas with severe traffic control problems but while the former keeps things flowing reasonably smoothly the latter film set to arrive in theaters just weeks later resembles a bumper-car nightmare. Narratively jumbled and jammed with so many characters that you give up keeping them all straight while simultaneously lamenting not seeing more of those you might actually want around Bryan Singers fourth entry in the enormously profitable series he inaugurated 16 years ago undeniably builds to a cataclysmic dramatic reckoning. But mostly it just feels like a bloated if ambitious attempt to shuffle as many mutants and specially gifted characters as possible into a story of a resurrected god ready to take over the world. Series fans will no doubt have many bones to pick with the choices made here but that wont stop the film from soaring at the box office; Singers last franchise outing X-Men Days of Future Past two years ago was at 748 million worldwide the highest grosser in the bunch to date. X-Men First Class Matthew Vaughns particularly good installment five years back worked actual world history -- the Cuban missile crisis -- into the franchise in arresting ways. Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg continue in that vein here but less advantageously. The opening sequence set in 3600 BCE in the Nile Valley looks like nothing so much as unused footage from the recent unlamented Exodus Gods and Kings and after a giant pyramid comes crashing down the next 40 minutes careen around like a hard-hit pool ball from Poland to Britain and Cairo and CIA headquarters. As most fans will already know before they rush out on opening weekend the point of all the international agitation is the arrival or rebirth of Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac resembling an ornate member of the Blue Man Group) whos been in hibernation for 5600 years and as of his reawakening in 1983 is nothing if not well-rested. His deity complex is out of control and his powers appear so unlimited that its questionable why he needs additional help in order to have his annihilating way with the world. But even the strongest general needs an army and every apocalypse needs its four horsemen so in addition to three lieutenants of limited usefulness he also lures the undeniably talented Pole Magneto (Michael Fassbender) stirring his anger by taking him to Auschwitz and helpfully informing him that ""This is where your people were slaughtered."" You dont need to be Claude Lanzmann to be somewhat appalled by the appropriation of this place and the memories it summons for the purposes of a mutant summit meeting. On the more sedate grounds of the School for Gifted Children telepathic original X-Man Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is surrounded by mutants of great potential and Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) has been at work creating a very advanced combat plane. After considerable time has been given over to shuffling in a whole bunch of characters of dubious ability to help in a street fight much less in one against a villain whose evil has been maturing for several millennia Apocalypse shows whos in charge by launching the worlds entire supply of nuclear missiles and sending them tumbling into outer space. But just when you think the narrative is now set to accelerate on a straight and narrow track toward an exciting climax a really buff wild man with long sharp claws and unkempt hair turns up for no discernable reason other than to make a token appearance. Once Apocalypse begins fulfilling his promise to ""wipe clean this world"" by destroying world cities shown in the usual pornographic detail for this sort of film the X-Men and women go about doing their thing once again. But the weight of so many characters defrays the impact and interest just as it deprives key veterans of the franchise most notably Jennifer Lawrence (more often seen as Raven than Mystique) of much chance to contribute. Despite the undeniable presence of a huge amount of action X-Men Apocalypse is decidedly a case of more is less especially when compared with the surprising action and more interesting personal interactions (including the temporary subtraction of some characters) in other big Marvel franchises.

On screen however it turns out to be about a franchise taking a giant step backwards. After the rejuvenated one-two punch of 2011s First Class and 2014s Days of Future Past there was reason to expect better. A lot better. But Apocalypse feels like a confused kitchen-sink mess with a half dozen too many characters a villain who amounts to a big blue nothing and a narrative thats so choppy and poorly cut together that it feels like youre watching a flipbook instead of a movie. As the X-Men faithful have known since Days of Future Pasts post-end credits sequence two years ago the big baddie this time around would be (and is) Apocalypse--the worlds first mutant who ruled over Ancient Egypt more than 5000 years ago like a Nile god. And thats precisely where Singers film promisingly kicks off with an ominous tableau of gold-tipped pyramids ritual human sacrifice and Young Sherlock Holmes-style chanting. Apocalypse who looks like a cross between Watchmens Doctor Manhattan and the breakfast-cereal specter Booberry (and nothing remotely like the great actor trapped beneath the makeup Oscar Isaac) attempts to transfer his consciousness and myriad mutant abilities into an unwitting victims body when hes foiled by a band of rebels and basically put into hibernation...until hes roused in 1983. Ah the Reagan era. A period when the Cold War battle between good and evil was decidedly more clear-cut than the skirmishes amongst the global fraternity of X-Men. The first-third of the film is spent on introductions to new mutants like Tye Sheridans laser-sighted Cyclops Sophie Turners mindreading misfit Jean Grey Kodi Smit-McPhees Teutonic teleporter Nightcrawler and Olivia Munns Psylocke who has a groovy fuchsia lightsabery-sword hand. Some of these new kids on the block are fighting for good (Team Xavier); others for evil (Team Apocalypse) which will sound very familiar to anyone who just sat through the Marvel Universes other (and infinitely better) recent battle royal Captain America Civil War. The familiar faces are all back too. But for how much longer is anyones guess judging from the general expression of tedium creeping across the faces of Jennifer ""Mystique"" Lawrence and Michael ""Magneto"" Fassbender. James McAvoy at least gets to deliver a few breezy punch lines as Professor Xavier when hes not touching his temples like hes feeling the onset of the worlds worst tension headache. With the arrival of Apocalypse Xaviers good guys and gals snap into action to stop nothing less than the end of the world before its too late. (Yes nothing less than the end of the world And yet it feels like theres bupkis at stake.) Part of the problem I think is how uninteresting Apocalypse is as a foe. With his leathery aqua reptilian skin and cobra-cowl he keeps trying to lure various X-Men over to the Dark Side like a broken-record Darth Vader. The guys kind of a relentless pest. The other part of the problem is that Singer keeps cutting from subplot to subplot and setting to setting with such frequency that he seems hellbent on preventing the audience from getting involved with any one storyline or character. Hugh Jackmans Wolverine does a drive-by for one scene and then splits--apparently so we wouldnt forget about him before his next spin-off. Less tastefully Apocalypse brings Magneto back to Auschwitz (the sacred ground where his tragic backstory began as a child) and it just feels...wrong. You almost want to cheer when Fassbender says ""You shouldnt have brought me here"" Its not all bad though. There are some funny in-jokes like a swipe at the terrible X-Men 3 (aka Last Stand). Turner is promising as Jean Grey and Evan Peters Quicksilver gets another super-slo-mo showstopper scored to Eurythmics period-appropriate synth-jam ""Sweet Dreams."" But all in all Apocalypse is a third-tier X-Men movie that arrives at a time when studios and filmmakers who traffic in spandex need to be at the top of their game. We know all of the cliches and all of the tropes too well at this point to settle for place-holding mediocrity. We know the difference between an instant classic and a dog. Apocalypse isnt quite a dog. But it is a movie with way too much of everything except the things that should matter the most--novelty creativity and fun.

(ScreenPlay) Watch the official trailer for ""X-Men Apocalypse."" (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The stakes in the boringly apocalyptic ""X-Men Apocalypse"" (opening May 26) couldnt be higher.  Its long-entombed ready-to-party mutant god played by Oscar Isaac is both invincible and immortal and he wants to control every single mind in every single human on Earth. The worlds nukes are unleashed willy-nilly though that part works out fine. Its a ""just kidding"" moment of imminent global destruction.Then the movie levels the entire city of Cairo leaving (presumably) many millions dead and injured. Well you cant worry about everyone all the time. The film leaves the grieving and anger about collateral damage to this years major rival superhero franchise installments ""Batman v Superman"" (the bad one) and ""Captain America Civil War"" (the good one). This ones ""the OK one.""RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR I cant recommend much about this latest ""X-Men"" picture without getting into problematic and somewhat embarrassing territory. For example Olivia Munn. Shes barely in it and shes barely wearing much of barely anything yet I spent much of Bryan Singers earnest competently crafted slog texting notes to myself regarding a petition Id like to circulate that launches Munns telepathic ninja warrior mutant Psylocke into her own franchise. Shes one of A-pocks ""four horsemen"" the woman with the devil in her eyes brandishing a digital lightsaber-y lasso. ""X-Men Apocalypse"" invests heavily in the moist-eyed emoting going on in the neighborhood of James McAvoy (Professor X the one with the fancy  boarding school for the specially gifted). The storyline requires Michael Fassbender and Jennifer Lawrence (the conflicted Magneto and the conflicted Raven respectively) to try their damndest not to look as bored as they likely are with these roles better for their income than their craft. Munns a different livelier story. Shes stoked.After an ancient Egyptian prologue were plunked down into 1983. Apocalypse comes back to life looks around and calls for a cleansing of the planets debris and weakness like a mutant villain version of Travis Bickle. Screenwriter Simon Kinberg lumbers through the conflicts pitting McAvoys man of reason and hope against his old pal Magnetos darker impulses. Like ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Civil War"" its superhero vs. superhero in ""Apocalypse""; the ensemble members have no choice but to turn on each other.Director Singer handles the traffic earnestly and well with a modicum of snark and 1.5 teaspoons of levity. Theres a joke at the expense of the long-ago far-away third ""X-Men"" picture the lousy one directed by Brett Ratner.  But this ones no gem. Its simply large and long (two-and-a-half hours the usual length lately with these products). I remain unpersuaded and slightly galled by the attempts to interpolate the history locale and tragic meaning of Auschwitz into what used to be known as popcorn movies. The dialogue has a metallic tinny ring (wheres Magneto when you need him?). At one point Rose Byrnes intelligence agent speculates in her exquisitely underplayed way on the intentions of their chief adversary. This surly pushy Egyptian mutant god routine might well ""end in disaster ... some kind of ... apocalypse."" Pause. Then McAvoy puts on his best Serious Actor face and solemnly adds ""Mmm. The end of the world."" John Dykstra supervised the visual effects which are relentless and routine. Like I said Ive seen worse this year.

""X-Men Apocalypse"" challenges what you know about the past. Take for example the Egyptian pyramids. Once thought to be graves for the pharaohs it turns out that the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were conceived as an instrument for historys very first mutant a quasi-immortal purple guy called En Sabah Nur (a.k.a. ""Apocalypse"") to ritualistically transfer his consciousness from a dying body to a healthy one. Ben Carson was way off the mark. READ MORE X-Men Apocalypse Trailer New Footage Shows Hugh Jackmans Wolverine amp; Oscar Isaac Pre-Apocalypse -- Watch This is Bryan Singers fourth X-Men film -- the third installment in the second trilogy of summer blockbusters about the first generation of super-powered mutants who have outed themselves to the general population -- and it unfolds like hes pouring all of his excess ambitions for the franchise into his last chance at bat. If nothing else the spectacularly goofy and sporadically entertaining ""Apocalypse"" isnt afraid to reimagine human history. As if the prologue werent enough to make that sufficiently clear the opening credits turn our species worst atrocities into an immersive 3D theme park attraction (""Its a Terrible World?"") the camera whooshing through a computer-generated tunnel as swastikas and other universally understood symbols of hatred are hurled towards the lens. For a very cartoonish movie full of latex outfits and boasting a set piece soundtracked by Eurythmics ""Apocalypse"" doesnt hesitate to grapple with some very delicate subjects. The harmony that Singer strikes between the silly and the sacred has been crucial to the success of his previous ""X-Men""  installments and its this ones greatest strength. And then -- in what might be the most striking scene in the modern history of superhero movies -- Magneto single-handedly destroys Auschwitz. Go ahead and read that last bit over again. A Holocaust survivor enraged by the new round of violence that has been visited upon his family uses his mutant abilities to erase the worlds most profound memorial to Jewish suffering. Thanks to Michael Fassbenders steely-eyed commitment to his character this potentially exploitative moment blooms into an powerful example of pop iconography. Obliterating the most infamous of concentration camps is arguably the greatest of all Jewish fantasies but theres a good reason why Auschwitz is a museum Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. Magneto however is actively in a rush to forget. After all Apocalypse is recruiting him to be help lead a new genocide one determined to eradicate the earth of all its weakness. Its hardly a surprise that the character is stuck in neutral for the rest of the movie; how do you top a beat like that? But it doesnt really matter. The message is clear History is as mutable as the people who shape it. This X-Men trilogy has been a bit confused on that point at times fatalistic and at others considerably less so. ""First Class"" argued that you cant change the past while follow-up ""Days of Future Past"" made a case to the contrary. ""Apocalypse"" sets the record straight Its not really about whether or not you can change the past because our brightest hope always lies in the future. And its certainly not about who changes the past because -- Magneto notwithstanding -- the heroes here are almost a complete afterthought and the performances of the actors who play them tend to follow suit (who knew Jennifer Lawrence could be so listless?) The thick of things are set in 1983. Germany is still split in two but Cold War paranoia of an imminent nuclear war has given way to slightly more optimistic thoughts of deterrence. The world is at a tipping point perched between the horror of yesterday and the fear of a mutant tomorrow. Meanwhile Teenagers. Professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is still doing his thing at his School for Gifted Youngers up in Westchester and -- as per usual -- the new students wont get much of a primer before theyre forced into battle. This years class is the least interesting to date as these pubescent versions of franchise staples are hopelessly hollow shades of their future selves. ""Game of Thrones"" star Sophie Turner delivers a dull Jean Grey while Tye Sheridan is equally forgettable as the laser-eyed Scott Summers (Kodi Smit-McPhee playing Nightcrawler as a guileless young Alan Cumming at least gets some fun one-liners). And Jubilee? Shes a costume in search of a character. The bad guys fare a tiny bit better. Apocalypse naturally has four horseman -- horsepeople really -- and theyre interesting enough for roles that exist for no other reason other than to provide some violent white noise during the final battle. Alexandra Shipp is particularly vibrant as a mohawked Storm who rises from street rat to demigod. Olivia Munns Psylocke is like window-dressing on a shuttered storefront her every shot somewhat cringeworthy. None of these poor actors are done any favors by Simon Kinbergs clumsy script which excels in broad strokes but fumbles so many of the character moments that the films emotion slides right off of its ideas. Sure Evan Peters warp-speed Quicksilver has another terrific sequence in which he puts time in a bottle but ""Apocalypse"" is practically the opposite of the movies in the MCU which often feel like a collection of fun exchanges in desperate need of direction. READ MORE Eye in the Sky Director Gavin Hood Talks About the Mistakes of X-Men Origins Wolverine Ironically its Apocalypse himself who saves the day. Played by a mercifully unrecognizable Oscar Isaac this guy might be the most cartoonish superhero movie villain since the Green Goblin in the original ""Spider-Man."" And yet his power is palpable. Capable of absorbing the abilities of the mutants whose bodies he hijacks Apocalypse has attained more skills than the movie has the time to illustrate and has understandably convinced himself that hes a god; imagine if Dr. Manhattan turned against us. While his climactic confrontation with the X-Men is an interminable cacophony of weightless special effects and hollow character moments Apocalypse makes the build-up tremor with doom. Few Hollywood spectacles have so fluently spoken to the anxiety of imbalanced power or the moral imperative that requires those who have it to protect those who dont. Most importantly the character of Apocalypse galvanizes these last three X-Men movies into an actual trilogy rather than a cynical hodgepodge of contractually obligated blockbusters -- the first X-Men series asked who we are and this one deepened that inquiry by asking what we must make of ourselves. ""Apocalypse"" for all its faults has the audacity to make the MCU look small and the conviction to make the DCU -- if there even is such a thing -- look foolish for confusing self-seriousness with gravity. If only these characters were allowed to be as complex as the ideas they fight for ""Apocalypse"" could have represented a new beginning for superhero cinema. Its one thing to show Magneto destroying Auschwitz; it would have been quite another to show him rebuilding it. Grade B- ""X-Men Apocalypse"" opens in theaters on May 27.

His work in the series has been at the very least entertaining and exciting and at its best (2003s ""X2"") representative of the apex of the superhero genre. Singers take on the material has always put character and theme at the center giving us interesting people grappling with issues that felt recognizable in the real world and never at the expense of thrilling action or wildly imaginative set pieces. With ""X-Men Apocalypse"" however Singer seems to have acquired a new mutant power of his own monotony. Whether its the lack of an interesting villain or the fact that the series time-travel element is forcing these mutants to meet each other (and the audience) all over again for the first time this latest entry marks a shocking letdown from Singers earlier contributions; what once soared now slogs. The year is 1983 and cultists have discovered the remains of an all-powerful being known as Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) whom the ancient Egyptians revered as a god even though hes really just mankinds original mutant able to project his consciousness into the bodies of other mutants absorbing their powers and youth each time. Enemies buried him under a pyramid but now hes back and ready to cleanse the world. Also Read X-Men Everything You Need to Know Before Watching Apocalypse (Photos) Meanwhile Magneto/Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) is hiding out in Poland living anonymously (and pseudonymously) as a steel worker with a wife and young child. When he uses his powers to save a co-worker in an industrial accident however his cover is blown which leads to tragic circumstances. The threat of Magnetos vengeful return sends Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) who has just rescued Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee ""Slow West"") from underground mutant fights in Germany back to upstate New York and the school run by Professor Xavier (James McAvoy). Meanwhile -- theres a lot of ""meanwhile"" in this movie -- Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan ""Mud"") comes to the academy to learn to control his eyebeams and he befriends telepath Jean Grey (Sophie Turner ""Game of Thrones"") whos having nightmarish premonitions perhaps about her own powers or about the endgame of Apocalypse whos busy recruiting his Four Horsemen Magneto Storm (Alexandra Shipp ""Straight Outta Compton"") Angel (Ben Hardy ""EastEnders"") and Psylocke (Olivia Munn). And if that summary sounds overstuffed it doesnt even include Hank McCoy/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) whos teaching at Xaviers school while keeping his blue fur at bay or CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) discovering the emergence of Apocalypse while not remembering the events of ""X-Men First Class"" after Xavier wiped her memory or the return of speedster Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who still hasnt told Magneto that hes his dad or the inevitable appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Also Read Bryan Singer Responds to X-Men Apocalypse Criticism Where ""Apocalypse"" falls apart is with its titular villain Hes generically evil setting out essentially to destroy everyone and everything on the planet a plan thats not only difficult to take seriously but also gives screenwriter Simon Kinberg (""Fantastic Four"") no metaphorical meat. Previous ""X-Men"" installments used the mutants and their struggles to comment on everything from the civil rights movement to coming-out in the LGBT community but all we can take from this film is standard-issue superhero battles. Those skirmishes are perfectly fine granted but they dont amount to much since the bad guy is such a blank and since we never feel that Apocalypse is going to succeed; youll find more genuine stakes in ""The Angry Birds Movie."" Even the films action centerpiece -- Quicksilver rescuing everyone from an exploding building in cheeky slo-mo -- feels like an exact copy of a better sequence from ""Days of Future Past."" You have to wonder what kind of extraordinary drama or comedy -- or heck even superhero adventure -- that Singer could make with this impressive ensemble but no one gets much of a chance to make an impression good or bad with the exception of Turner whos overly subdued and Olivia Munn. Also Read Why Olivia Munn Chose X-Men Apocalypse and Not Deadpool Whats Munns reward for three impressive seasons on HBOs ""The Newsroom""? A costume thats more appropriate for a cosplay fetish ball than for combat. Theres that joke about yellow spandex that Wolverine makes in the first ""X-Men"" movie the one that underscores the fact that outfits that work on paper dont necessarily translate to film and one wishes that Psylockes ninja-stripper get-up had received similar consideration. Singers regular composer John Ottman works overtime to make us feel that exciting important things are happening but the movie never delivers them. ""X-Men Apocalypse"" provides a hint at what might one day take down the ubiquitous superhero genre utter dullness. For all its bangs the movie is ultimately a whimper. Email The 25 Greatest Comic Book Movie Roles Ever (Videos) 25.) Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan ""Watchmen"" Some feel Zach Snyders only truly superpowered hero should have had a booming voice but Crudups diminished delivery shows how the characters humanity has faded as his powers increasingly distance him from everyone around him. 24.) Mickey Rourke as Marv ""Sin City"" Marv doesnt start fights but hell finish them. Rourke brought a brutal intensity to Frank Millers violent protagonist while also revealing the softer side that rarely gets a chance to come out in the brutal world Marv lives in. 23.) Ron Perlman as Hellboy Perlmans cigar-chomping swagger made Hellboy one of the most unique protagonists in comic book history. Having a top-notch makeup and costume team didnt hurt either. 22.) Dave Bautista as Drax ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" All of the Guardians were a joy to watch -- Chris Pratt almost made this list -- but Dave Bautista was the most unexpected. The former wrestler turned Drax into a character who was both a hilarious meathead and a lost soul in need of healing. 21.) Gary Oldman as Jim Gordon ""Batman Begins"" Christopher Nolans Gotham City was the most realistic take on Batmans hometown ever thanks in large part to its most famous cop. Oldman portrayed Gordon as an honest lawman trying his hardest to deal with a city out of control and the most unexpected ally he could have ever encountered. 20.) Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool ""Deadpool"" Reynolds breakthrough performance earlier this year gets credit not just for what appears in the movie but for Reynolds advance work in acquainting audiences with the character through viral videos. Thanks to his flawless dark comedy everyone had already bought in to ""Deadpool"" by the time it came out. 19.) Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent ""The Dark Knight"" When he becomes Two-Face Eckhart never turns the district attorney into a deranged villain like the Joker. His Dent starts as a man who truly envisions a better world making it all the more tragic when he succumbs to the Jokers horribly twisted view of it. 18.) Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" Hes not a superhero but Scott Pilgrim is possibly the most accurate satire of the millennial generation committed to film. Cera projects the social awkwardness and immaturity of the character transforming into a responsible and self-aware man by the films climax. 17.) Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach ""Watchmen"" Zach Snyder may have been a bit too obsessed with Rorschachs violent tendencies but Haleys growls and snarls were a perfect match for the uncompromising antihero. 16.) Chloe Grace Moretz as Hit-Girl ""Kick-Ass"" Shes foul-mouthed. Shes violent. Shes 12 years old. Moretzs Hit-Girl was quite possibly the most polarizing piece of child acting in modern cinema and helped establish Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman as populist provocateur filmmakers. 15.) Bradley Cooper as Rocket ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" Cooper successfully dared audiences to take one of the silliest characters in the Marvel canon seriously. Rocket spent his whole life being reviled as a freak show and by the time he meets the Guardians hes begun to internalize it. (Subtitles) Guardians of the Galaxy (022/050... by Guardians_of_the_Galaxy 14.) Scarlet Johannson as Black Widow ""Captain America Civil War"" Everyone in ""Civil War"" knows what side theyre going to take ... except Natasha. ScarJo does a great job showing how conflicted Black Widow is being stuck in the middle of a volatile face-off between two of her closest friends. 13.) Tom Hiddleston as Loki ""Thor"" For all its critical acclaim Marvel Studios isnt known for making memorable villains. Loki is the exception. Desperate to prove himself worthy of being Odins son at any cost Loki is a more engaging character than his heroic brother. 12.) Michael Caine as Alfred Pennyworth ""The Dark Knight Rises"" In Nolans trilogy Batman has spent so much time trying to give Gotham hope that he hasnt left any for himself. Alfred does everything he can to save Bruce from the destructive road hes taking and to show him that he doesnt have to give his life to the cowl and cape. 11.) Hugh Jackman as Wolverine ""X-Men"" No matter how good or bad the ""X-Men"" movies are Wolverine always remains a blast to watch. The roles also great for Hugh Jackman fans as it remains far removed from anything else hes done. 10.) Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America ""Captain America The First Avenger"" This was the moment Marvel proved it could turn anything into gold. Evans made a WWII-era hero relevant to a modern worldwide audience. Through him Cap is a blend of Batmans sense of duty and Supermans ideals. 9.) Patrick Stewart as Professor X ""X-Men"" Gentle heady and compassionate Stewarts Charles Xavier is a perfect foil for Ian McKellens Magneto. He is both a leader and a teacher and X-Men comic book writers have since modeled the character after Stewarts example. 8.) J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson ""Spiderman"" Theres never been a funnier character in a comic book movie. Triple-J is a nightmare boss and a tightwad husband on a caffeine buzz and Simmons brings the jokes at a rapid-fire pace. 7.) Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman ""Batman Returns"" Anne Hathaway was good in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" but Pfeiffers shift from the mousy Selina Kyle to the dangerous Catwoman is extremely unnerving. 6.) Ian McKellen as Magneto ""X-Men"" Like Patrick Stewart Sir Ians classically-trained style brings weight to whatever role he inhabits. So it is with Magneto a character that in this actors hands feels dangerously smart and a worthy opponent for Xavier to engage in a battle of wits. 5.) Jack Nicholson as the Joker ""Batman"" His performance might come across as corny in 2016 but make no mistake In 1989 Nicholson was the definitive Joker blending perfectly with Tim Burtons gritty yet darkly whimsical version of Gotham City. 4.) Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man ""Captain America Civil War"" RDJ and Tony Stark have come a long way in the last eight years and the latest Marvel movie proves it. The Iron Man in this film is cautious emotionally scarred and futilely trying to keep everything from falling apart. And thats before he discovers a horrifying truth about his past in the climax. 3.) Christopher Reeve as Superman ""Superman The Movie"" Nearly 40 years later Reeve remains the definitive Superman the model on which future portrayals of the character have been based. His calm confidence and gentle use of his strength helped establish the Man of Steel as a being of unlimited power who does everything he can to not use it. 2.) Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman ""Spiderman 2"" Maybe one day Tom Holland will become the quintessential Spiderman but Maguires performance as a conflicted Parker showed how human superheroes could be. The Spiderman sequel set a narrative model that Marvel movies are still using to great success 12 years later. 1.) Heath Ledger as the Joker ""The Dark Knight"" There are few villains in all of cinema not just comic book movies as chilling as Ledgers Joker. His performance shows just how nihilistic and destructive the character can be while remaining uncomfortably casual about it. Real-world despots and terrorists notwithstanding this is what pure evil looks like. Previous ; Next 1 of 25 Who from the cast of ""Captain America Civil War"" enters the pantheon of comic book movie greats? 25.) Billy Crudup as Dr. Manhattan ""Watchmen"" Some feel Zach Snyders only truly superpowered hero should have had a booming voice but Crudups diminished delivery shows how the characters humanity has faded as his powers increasingly distance him from everyone around him.

The X-Men face their biggest challenge in the all-powerful Apocalypse. Director Bryan Singer. (Running Time 227) PG-13 Sequences of violence action and destruction brief strong language and some suggestive images. Opens 5/27 in area theaters. With his fourth movie ""X-Men Apocalypse"" director Bryan Singer proves hes still as good as Professor X at handling Marvels mutants. Set ten years after ""Days of Future Past"" Professor Xaviers class of super-powered outcasts has to take on Apocalypse allegedly the worlds first (and most powerful) mutant who ruled the world of ancient Egypt before being trapped under his pyramid for centuries. Played by Oscar Isaac -- unrecognizable as his ""Stars Wars The Force Awakens"" character Poe Dameron under the prosthetic make-up -- Apocalypse awakens in the early 80s at the height of the Cold War and he isnt happy about the state of the world since the end of his rule. X-MEN APOCALYPSE TRAILER BOASTS POWERFUL IMAGERY Yes thats Oscar Isaac under all that makeup as the big bad of ""X-Men Apocalypse."" (Courtesy Twentieth Century Fox) After effectively rebooting the franchise with ""X-Men First Class"" in 2011 Singer brings back the most popular characters from the previous movies -- James McAvoys Professor X Michael Fassbenders Magneto Jennifer Lawrences Mystique and Nicholas Hoults The Beast -- and theyre joined by new and younger versions of the X-Men Singer introduced in his first ""X-Men"" movie. Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) Jean Grey (Sophie Turner from ""Game of Thrones"") Storm (Alexandra Shipp) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee) are all given fresh takes on characters previously played in the franchise by older actors. Fans of the comic books will also thrill to the first appearance by Psylocke (Olivia Munn) and a new and deadlier Archangel (Ben Hardy) who make up one half of Apocalypses ""Four Horsemen"" crew. Granted there are a lot of characters and set-up plus tons of drama but Singer has such a great cast at his disposal including one Oscar winner an Oscar nominee and Oscar Isaac himself who many feel is long overdue for similar awards attention. Fassbender and Lawrence are especially good during their more dramatic moments and Isaac always makes Apocalypse an imposing presence. X Marks the Spot Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique Rose Byrne as Moira MacTaggert James McAvoy as Professor X Lucas Till as Havok and Nicholas Hoult as Beast in ""X-Men Apocalypse."" (Photo Alan Markfield) Once again its Evan Peters Quicksilver who steals the movie whenever we see his powers in action maybe because theyve found a unique way to showcase them. Theres even a fun but unnecessary tangent involving another popular ""X-Men"" character. After sixteen years working with the characters its obvious Singer knows them well enough to mix and match from different eras of the comics and still make it work as a cohesive story. The relationships between the characters also transition well from the comic page even with so many new actors in the roles. At times it feels like Singer is trying to fit as much as humanly possible into this movie just in case its his last. By the time it gets to the climactic showdown against Apocalypse its obvious what an unstoppable force he is and everything leading up to that point does pay off. Jennifer Lawrence is the star but Evan Peters steals his scenes as Quicksilver. (Photo Alan Markfield) This might not be the best superhero movie for the youngest of kids because there are moments that are darker and more violent than other Marvel fare. Otherwise ""X-Men Apocalypse"" offers a lot of entertainment value for your movie-spending buck and its very consistent with the previous two movies in terms of its impressive CG-enhanced action. In the end shifting the focus to the younger characters works well. Unlike some of the cheesier remnants of the 80s well probably want to see more of these new X-Men.

Theres a wince-inducing scene in the middle of X-Men Apocalypse that says just about everything you need to know about this sprawling superheroic mess. Its 1983 and a group of teenage mutants walk out of a screening of Return of the Jedi arguing like middle-aged film critics. One comments ""But third movies are always the worst."" So thats a dig at the third X-Men flick (2006s Brett Ratner-directed X-Men The Last Stand). Its also a self-aware nod to this movies own place as a third prequel and a bitchy reference to another nerdiverse all in one smirking throwaway line. And if you dont get all three levels you may as well get up and leave. The plot is as old as the Pyramids quite literally In ancient Egypt original mutant and marauding rage-smurf Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is betrayed and buried under a thousand feet of rubble. Millennia later hes revived (apparently because someone leaves a door open) to wreak havoc on humanity once again. Its up to Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) Professor X (James McAvoy) and a frankly ludicrous number of supporting characters to put an end to his evil scheme. And thats really it There are no surprises or switcheroos here just a seen-it-before world domination plot carried out by a petulant Pharaoh with a head like a chewed pencil and resisted by a bunch of interchangeable Lycra-clad goody-goodies whose names and superpowers youll quickly stop trying to keep track of. There are standout performances Sophie Turner (a.k.a. Game of Thrones Sansa Stark) works hard as doomed psychic Jean Grey and Michael Fassbenders bristling Magneto is always a pleasure even if his character motivation is crass (a visit to Auschwitz is particularly ill-judged). There are no memorable action scenes--the closest we get is a virtual rerun of the time-freeze sequence from the previous movie. And the script is just nonsense comprised entirely of sarcastic asides portentous gobbledygook (""The dawn of a new age will rise"" cries Isaac) and insider references that only the faithful will appreciate. Unless thats you its best to steer clear.
