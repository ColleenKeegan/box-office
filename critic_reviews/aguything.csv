Bland results will extract stray bucks. Though youth-skewed comedy ""A Guy Thing"" does get slightly better as it goes along the presence of four (credited) scenarists suggests a familiar syndrome at play Whatever creative spark or individuality might have existed in early drafts got ""polished"" into oblivion between rewrites. Bland results will extract stray bucks in the romantic comedy sweepstakes amid the usual January new-release drought but pic should be heading to the rental shelves by the time spring thaw sets in. So old-hat square in its initial reels you might think youre watching ""Barefoot in the Park The Prequel"" -- or at least something perhaps once intended for older lead thesps -- tale commences as Seattle yuppie Paul (Jason Lee) sheepishly confronts his bachelor party at watering hole the Hula Lounge. Hoping to avoid embarrassing situations he lets best bud Jim (Shawn Hatosy) pose as groom when skimpily-clad ""Tiki Girls"" invade the room. Still booze has its effect and the last thing Paul remembers is buying a beer for one such grass-skirted lass. The next morning finds Paul waking next to the very same girl (Julia Stiles) whom he hustles out just in time to avoid incoming fiancee Karen (Selma Blair). One little fib leads to another as do contrived coincidences. It soon emerges that the nameless bedmate is Karens cousin Becky who will be involved in all the coming weeks pre-wedding festivities. Pileup of inconvenient events is worsened by the sniffing around of Beckys still-possessive ex-boyfriend Ray (Lochlyn Munro) a steroid-raging rogue cop who thinks Paul his latest rival. Actually latter is feeling some bothersome mutual romantic vibes with the comely cousin. But mostly hes trying to hold things together so the Big Day can go as planned. Of course it doesnt with a de rigeur change of heart at the altar. Before then ""A Guy Thing"" provides rote slapstick routine situations a few ethnic stereotypes and impersonally competent packaging from TV-trained soph feature helmer Chris Koch (""Snow Day""). Theres also archaic trash-vs.-class contrast between Pauls cheerfully vulgar folks (Julie Hagerty David Koechner) and Karens wealthy-snooty ones (James Brolin Diana Scarwid). Plus a getting-the-oldsters-unknowingly-high-on-grass sequence a tussle with a vicious guard dog and so forth. Original ideas are M.I.A. here though in its later progress pic does pile on more colorful complications hinting at a more absurdist/farcical strain that should have been allowed to run rampant. Perhaps at some developmental point they did. Unfortunately theres very little wildness (or true hilarity) apparent in end product. Becky is meant to be a free spirit but comes off only as mildly flaky. Pauls exulting ""Ive never done anything like that before"" -- several times -- after driving a bit fast is meant to be the cry of gray-flannel-suit liberation. Stiles admirers will find her wasted here while Lee and Blair are as bland as the material seemingly requires. Support perfs are uninspired tech/design aspects routinely slick.

Directed by Chris Koch from a screenplay by Greg Glienna Pete Schwaba Matt Tarses and Bill Wrubel. 101 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language crude humor some sexual content and drug references. Several theaters. Jason Lee looking so sheepish hes practically ready for shearing sits in the middle of his bachelor party at a raucous bar having no fun at all. ""A Guy Thing"" is only two minutes old but weve already learned plenty most notably that Paul (Lee) is engaged to the perfect Karen but his eyes droop just a bit when shes mentioned like shes homework that he hasnt finished. Then when Julia Stiles shimmies into the bar in a bikini top and hula skirt -- shes a semi-exotic dancer hired for the occasion -- Paul perks up and offers her a beer. Hmm where can this be going? And what will Karen think when she arrives at Pauls apartment the next morning and finds the hula girl there? ""A Guy Thing"" gamely trots through the paces of its story Boy meets girl boy already has other girl boy hides first girls underwear from second girl ... oh never mind you can figure it out yourself. Suffice to say that poor perfect Karen is doomed to join cinemas list of roadkill fiancees (actually the fact that shes played by Selma Blair whos making a career out of playing the Preppy Girl in a Turtleneck Who Doesnt Get the Guy is a bit of a tip-off) that Lee and Stiles are cute as a button together and that the movie has a couple of genuine laughs. (The best one is a play on the movies title spoken by an understanding clerk.) Stiles surprisingly is the revelation here -- this seems an awfully lightweight vehicle in which to unleash a star turn but shes got a genuine sparkle minus the too-cool-for-school boredom shes been known to exude. Her character Becky isnt given much personality by the written-by-committee screenplay (other than a tendency toward clumsiness); Stiles gives her a wry self-deprecating humor and airy sweetness and the always-likable Lee is a good match for her. In the hands of a more skilled director (Chris Koch is best known for ""Snow Day"") and a better screenplay this one could have been a charmer but ""A Guy Thing"" gets bogged down by predictable supporting characters and some tasteless humor. (Since when did a diarrhea scene become a staple of romantic comedy? Is it some sort of weird bonding ritual? Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock had a similar scene in ""Two Weeks Notice"" and they couldnt pull it off either.) Add to this Beckys psychotic ex-boyfriend Karens snobbish parents Pauls polyester-clad mom and stepdad an alcoholic aunt who likes to grab mens crotches the disapproving minister next door a would-be caterer with a taste for pharmaceuticals and Pauls best buddy/sidekick who likes to refer to himself in the third person (""Jim is on it""). ""A Guy Thing"" is a very busy movie about very little. The Space Needle and Pike Place Market turn up fleetingly; the film is supposedly set in Seattle but filmed in Vancouver B.C. For a local audience it adds just another level of disorientation to a movie that never quite finds its focus. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

M-459 Becky (JULIA STILES) is a new-to-the-business hula girl at Pauls (JASON LEE) bachelor party in MGM Pictures comedy A GUY THING. Male trouble / A young man strays from his bride-to-be in inane ugly A Guy Thing 1 / 1 Back to Gallery A GUY THING Romantic comedy. Starring Jason Lee Julia Stiles and Selma Blair. Directed by Chris Koch. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Hes fairly funny (Jason Lee) and shes pretty (Julia Stiles). There are a couple of laughs and a handful of chuckles in ""A Guy Thing"" and its never exactly boring. So in a way if using a pretty low threshold -- the standard the filmmakers set for themselves no doubt -- ""A Guy Thing"" could qualify as some kind of a good movie. But what a childish empty effort and what a dispiriting thing to watch or think back on watching. The comedy is cheap not character-driven but arbitrary and despite the title the movie has nothing to say about men boys or things. Worst of all the movie leads to a cringe-inducing climax that contrary to what the filmmakers seem to think shows the lead character in a dreadful light and makes a point thats the complete opposite of what theyre trying to say. The picture was written by Greg Glienna who wrote and directed ""Meet the Parents"" and the new movie shares a family resemblance with the earlier film but only in the way that homely siblings can sometimes resemble beautiful ones. Like ""Meet the Parents"" ""A Guy Thing"" takes place in the frantic days leading up to a wedding and like the earlier picture the new one plays out as a series of escalating embarrassments involving a diffident hapless young man. The young man in question is Paul (Lee) a groom-to-be who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with a pretty stranger named Becky (Stiles) in his bed. He has no idea how she got there but he does know his fiancee (Selma Blair) is about to show up at his door. So he whisks Becky out and hides her underwear in the toilet tank. (The garbage pail would have been too easy.) Thus begins the coverup which as anyone who remembers Watergate knows can often get a fellow into even deeper trouble. As Paul Lee has a smirky charm and decent comic timing but he lacks the bottomless capacity for humiliation and disgrace that makes Ben Stiller so funny in this kind of role. More wise guy than everyman Lee cant help but suggest a self-satisfaction that seems slightly at odds with this bland fellow buried in a safe job (adman for a hunting magazine) and coasting toward a safe marriage with the boss daughter. FUNNY FATHER-IN-LAW As in ""Meet the Parents"" the father-in-law-to-be (James Brolin) is an intimidating mans man who has a picture of himself with the president of the United States in his office. Even working with a watered-down rehash of better material director Chris Koch finds ways to make the father-in-law scenes at least funny with Brolin at one point sitting at the head of a boardroom blowing hot and cold and terrifying his employees. Other comic moments just flat-line. At the rehearsal dinner the cook loads the gravy with marijuana and everybody gets stoned. But why does the cook do it? Theres no reason except to generate a comic scene out of thin air. The operative word here is thin. Theres also an entire subplot involving a lunatic policeman (Lochlyn Munro) Beckys jealous ex-boyfriend thats downright ugly. He keeps threatening and beating up the protagonist. Not only are these scenes unpleasant but they also come out of nowhere having nothing to do with Pauls decision to lie about his night with Becky. Its just a piling on of random bad luck to diminishing comic effect. Stiles looks college age at most and therefore a little young for the role. But her obvious intelligence and her low matter-of-fact voice which sounds like that of a 35-year-old put her in another casting category. It will be interesting to see what she does when her face catches up with her voice. In the meantime all she can do here is stand around and look interesting. ""A Guy Thing"" gives her no room to actually be interesting. A CRUEL COWARD If the movie has a point (it doesnt but it pretends to) its that Paul may be a nice guy but he needs to take a chance in life. That would be an innocuous point except that what the movie postulates as taking a chance -- that Paul should dump his fiancee and take up with Becky -- isnt taking a chance at all. Whats courageous about breaking up with one girl when theres another waiting in the wings and a beautiful one at that? Paul starts off a coward but he doesnt grow into a man. He grows into a cruel coward. Thats not a guy thing; thats just his problem. . This film contains sexual situations.

Julia Stiles plays awisecracking and free-spirited Becky in A Guy Thing. Like last weeks Just Married its premise is hackneyed Nice guy (Jason Lee) wakes up after his bachelor party to find himself in bed not with his fiancee (Selma Blair) but with a beautiful stranger (Julia Stiles). Turns out shes his fiancees cousin and he embarks on a series of lies that spiral out of control. But unlike the witless Just Married theres enough chemistry between the leads a few ludicrous plot twists and a fair amount of laughs to entertain audiences. Lee a veteran of quirky Kevin Smith movies Dogma and Chasing Amy shows his talent for more mainstream comedy. A likable Everyman he tangles with a rage-aholic cop incites the ire of a stern clergyman and rankles his future father-in-law (James Brolin) a powerful crony of George Dubyas. A Guy Thing could signal Lees emergence as a romantic-comedy lead reminiscent of Tom Hanks in his Splash days. Stiles as a wisecracking free spirit has some winning moments especially when she and Lee outwit a snarling watchdog. Blair doesnt fare as well. She struck the right notes as a bitchy law student in Legally Blonde but here she comes off as smarmy and lackluster particularly when contrasted with the charming Lee and Stiles. Review of the movie A Guy Thing ( out of four) Stars Jason Lee Julia Stiles Selma Blair James Brolin Director Chris Koch Distributor MGM Rating PG-13 for language crude humor some sexual content and drug references. Opens Friday nationwide The movies strength lies in taking the standard cliche of romantic comedies and adding a slightly more clever spin. When Blair discovers Stiles panties in Lees apartment Lee concocts a ridiculous story about buying them as a gift for her and a store clerk plays along in an amusing way. Standout comedies are rare and no one could mistake the broad humor in this movie for subtle wit but it is unexpectedly silly fun.

"CNN.com - Review A Guy Thing is a bad thing - Jan. 17 2003 CNN Europe CNN Asia Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese On CNN TV Transcripts Headline News CNN International About CNN.com Preferences Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review A Guy Thing is a bad thing Good cast wasted on terrible script By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Julia Stiles and Jason Lee star in ""A Guy Thing."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com Movie reviews (CNN) -- OK everybody take a deep breath. Now if youre detecting traces of a truly odious aroma the source may very well be the new film ""A Guy Thing."" Starring Jason Lee -- an unfortunate choice for this his first leading role -- Julia Stiles and Selma Blair ""A Guy Thing"" is a classic case of a bad bad movie happening to perfectly good actors. No matter how mightily they tried -- and try they do -- no one could breath life into this aimless inane script. Indeed the script is a perfect example of too many chefs spoiling the broth. ""A Guy Thing"" had four -- count em four -- Hollywood scribes Greg Glienna (who wrote a great very funny movie 2000s ""Meet The Parents"") Pete Schwaba Matt Tarses and Bill Wrubel. Guess it looked like a good idea at the time but something horrible definitely happened between the pitch session and the final product. Lee plays Paul a likable guy whose life is on automatic pilot. Hes doing all the right things at the right time -- career girlfriend getting married -- but he lacks any kind of conviction about anything. Paul never takes chances or entertains any kind of risk. Everything is going according to plan including his fiancee Karen. Far from perfect Said fiancee is played by Blair. Karen is a picture-perfect girl who lives in a picture-perfect house with her picture-perfect upper-class parents played by the far from perfect James Brolin and Diana Scarwid. Now everyone in this flick comes off like a cartoon character but Brolin really ups the ante every time hes on screen. Then in what seems to be an impossible feat Pauls parents played by David Koechner and Julie Hagerty are given even less to work with than the rest of the cast. Its actually painful to watch these actors trying to wring laughs out of dialogue so dense and plastic that they probably cut their tongues trying to spit it out. How anyone kept a straight face or a shred of dignity is beyond me. Selma Blair plays Lees fiancee in ""A Guy Thing."" Stiles is Blairs characters cousin. Shawn Hatosy plays Pauls dimwitted best friend Jim. At Pauls bachelor party the groom fully intends to behave himself so Jim pretends to be the groom when the nights entertainment -- three girls dressed in grass skirts and phony leis doing a very lame hula -- shows up. One of the girls is Becky played by Stiles. Before you know it the film cuts to the next morning where Paul is in bed. In quick succession hes awakened by a phone call from his soon-to-be mother-in-law finds out that Karen is on her way over to his apartment and discovers that Becky is lying naked next to him in bed. He gets her dressed and out of the door seconds before a completely clueless Karen arrives. Karen is clueless throughout the film in fact which helps the plot sputter along. Of course Paul thinks the whole incident is over but at a dinner party at Karens house that night he finds out Becky is Karens cousin. How cute. Couldnt you just die with laughter? OK probably not. The best-laid plans The rest of the film consists of Karen blithely planning her magical wedding day while Paul and Becky get involved in a series of idiotic situations. Naturally theyre thrown together so much that they fall in love. Meanwhile squeezed into this stupid story is a subplot involving Pauls brother Thomas Lennon who is blatantly in love with his brothers soon-to-be-wife. If you cant guess the ending by now youre not paying attention. Not that I blame you. This whole mess was directed by Chris Koch who also brought us the insipid film ""Snow Day"" three years ago. If hes smart hell perform surgery on his resume and cut this puppy out of his list of credits. (He might want to do the same with ""Snow Day."") Koch usually works on TV sitcoms and his pacing and style is in keeping with a half-hour comedy. I kept waiting for a commercial break so I could run to the bathroom or better yet from the theater but the film just keeps going like an annoying wind-up toy. ""A Guy Thing"" lasts only 101 minutes but its so slow its like watching a sundial. This one is going to video so fast it will probably produce skid marks on its way out of the theaters. ""A Guy Thing"" opens nationwide on Friday January 17.

You see the promise of stardom dribbling through his fingers. To begin with this former skate punk looks terrible in sweaters; they turn him into the kind of emasculated dork you dont want to spend 90 minutes watching find his courage. Lees whipped middle-class schlemiel is engaged to control-freak yuppie Selma Blair but he really loves her cousin Julia Stiles. Theres not much more to it. ""A Guy Thing"" is abysmal one of those dumbed-into-the-gutter farces in which the hero keeps having to do things like crawl out a second-story window and onto a tree branch. Each PG-13 version of a ""tasteless"" joke is powered by the laziest of coincidences (in a drugstore Lee buys crotch medicine - and runs into his future mother-in-law). Whats painful is the sight of Lee transforming himself from a hostile rebel into a tame simpering lapdog. In ""A Guy Thing"" he looks as if hes about to get on his knees and start begging and what it feels like hes pleading for is mainstream acceptance. Surely theres a better fate than becoming just this months face.
