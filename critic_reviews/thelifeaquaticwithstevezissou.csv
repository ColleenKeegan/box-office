They discovered the glories of Rome the pleasures of Amsterdam. They reveled in the friendships theyd established during the filming of ""Oceans 11"" partying often and hard. And the proof is right up there on the screen. These people -- the filmmakers as well as the cast -- have brought a rare sense of camaraderie to their work. Unfortunately they forgot to bring a script. They even forgot in the midst of their joyous self-involvement to take good pictures of the places they visited. (Mr. Soderbergh an excellent shooter on other occasions did the slapdash cinematography.) This may not come as a complete surprise. ""Oceans 11"" -- the Soderbergh remake from 2001 not the tacky Rat Pack original from 1960 -- was pretty fluffy stuff though it told its tall tale of a Las Vegas casino heist with verve visual grace and a stream of banter that sounded like wit and sometimes was. Still ""Oceans 12"" makes its predecessor seem like Dostoyevsky. George Noltis script is little more than a few disorganized notions strung together and stretched out to feature length. The film gets a lift from David Holmess zestful score but most of it is sloppy and flat like ""Beat the Devil"" without the whimsy. The engine of the plot -- or the rubber-band motor -- is payback pure and simple. By the end of ""Oceans 11"" Andy Garcias casino owner Terry Benedict had lost 160 million to an odd-fellows-hall of miscreants led by the eponymous Danny Ocean (George Clooney). Now Benedict has tracked everyone down -- Oceans former crew includes Brad Pitt Matt Damon Don Cheadle and Bernie Mac -- and demanded his money back with interest. That means the thieves must find fertile new fields for thievery. Thus the trip to Europe where Mr. Pitts Rusty Ryan has been living in the lap of unlikelihood with an Interpol -- oops Europol -- detective played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. The presence of Ms. Zeta-Jones represents one of the movies few new ideas and a good one since her cheerfulness is exceeded only by her gorgeousness. Another involves The Night Fox (Vincent Cassel) a master thief who competes against Oceans crew in an effort to steal a priceless Faberge egg. A really bad idea involves drafting Dannys wife Tess played as before by Julia Roberts to help in the heist by impersonating Julia Roberts because she looks like Julia Roberts. She does indeed and another prominent celebrity in the picture looks like himself too but that doesnt diminish the sequences fatuousness. On the other hand Ms. Roberts like those around her certainly appears to be enjoying herself. Thats half the battle. The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou Eight years ago Wes Anderson made a gentle but memorable splash with ""Bottle Rocket"" a sweet-spirited debut feature about a quixotic crime team. His next film ""Rushmore"" was the saga of a precocious prep school student. Its become a small classic and no wonder (though I say this as someone whos been slow to appreciate it properly) -- the flamboyant hero Max Fischer personifies the pain grandiosity and promise of adolescence. Now Mr. Anderson has made ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" another quixotic comedy with another Anderson hero a Cousteau-like oceanographer-documentarian played by Bill Murray whos at once funny screwy childish gallant and rueful or downright depressed. Theres a lot to appreciate here especially Mr. Murrays variations on the sad but hopeful soul he played in ""Rushmore"" (and in ""Lost In Translation""). Yet meanings get lost in a clutter of cleverness. By institutionalizing his style so early in his career Mr. Anderson could be walking a plank of his own construction. I hope thats not the case because his films touch on themes that few others even reach for a yearning for childhood innocence; a cockeyed quest for love; existential bewilderment. (""Were all a pack of strays dont you get it?"" Steve says fondly of his motley crew.) The pretext for the plot in ""The Life Aquatic"" which Mr. Anderson wrote with Noah Baumbach is Steves picaresque Melville-esque search for a jaguar shark that ate one of his friends. But the voyage began in ""Rushmore"" with Maxs discovery of an inscription in a Cousteau book and his success in bestowing a lavish aquarium on the school that expelled him. The aquarium in ""The Life Aquatic"" is bigger and more colorful -- a magical ocean populated by charming stop-motion fish. The population above the water line is charming too when it isnt trying too hard to be picturesque Cate Blanchetts Jane a pregnant journalist who reads Proust aloud to enrich the aquatic life of her fetus; Anjelica Hustons Eleanor Steves starless-eyed wife and Owen Wilsons Ned who shows up to announce that he may or may not be Steves son. Steve needs a son needs one last shot at love and redemption. And we want to see him get it although wanting doesnt always equal feeling when the film keeps putting us off with self-irony and self-regard. Like the jaguar shark ""The Life Aquatic"" is hard to get a hook into. Bad Education After two flat-out triumphs in a row ""All About My Mother"" in 1999 and last years breathtaking ""Talk To Her"" Pedro Almodovar hasnt done it again. Yet lesser Almodovar -- in this instance ""Bad Education"" -- is better than most of the movies we see. ""Bad Education"" gets off to an intriguing start with an encounter between a young filmmaker Enrique (Fele Martinez) and an actor who is played complete with Castilian accent by the young Mexican star Gael Garcia Bernal. The actor cant get past the filmmakers protective assistant until he announces that hes Ignacio Enriques closest friend in parochial school. Ignacio wants to show Enrique a short story that hes written about their childhood while Mr. Almodovar wants to tell us a semi-autobiographical story thats longer and much more complex with extravagant fantasy versions of what turns out to be a chilling truth. The complexities are fascinating if confusing -- the film is as beautifully crafted as weve come to expect from the director. Were treated to the spectacle of Mr. Bernal an international heartthrob of recent vintage playing a drag queen in a blonde wig. (The film is rated NC-17 for explicit sex.) As for the flashbacks to the two men as boys they evoke a whole vanished world of pleasure terror and anguish. The boys love each other passionately but Ignacio a choir soloist with an exquisite voice is also loved and fatefully coveted by Father Manolo a predatory priest. This is the films beating heart a story of trust abused and of the terrible consequences of that abuse in later life. The rest is decoration which is well and good -- Pedro Almodovar has no peer as a decorator -- except for a persistent sense of the filmmaker recycling old motifs and sexual preoccupations and for a listlessness beneath the flashiness in Mr. Bernals performance. (He doesnt look like hes having much fun in or out of drag.) An after title tells us that Enrique ""is still making films with the same passion."" May the same prove true of Almodovar next time.

"At the Movies The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou 120804 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the Movies The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou By Christy Lemire| Associated Press Wednesday December 08 2004 With each new movie he makes Wes Anderson drifts further away from the rare gem that was ""Rushmore."" In ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" as in that 1998 film the director has created another meticulously structured intentionally quirky universe. But his largest and most ambitious film yet seems more like an extension of his most recent one ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" from 2001 for its outright absurdity - and unfortunately for its notable lack of heart. Andersons gleeful take-off on undersea adventure movies (and on movies about the making of movies) is never boring and its consistently laugh-out-loud funny. Hes always given his characters a distinctive cadence to their speech and here with writing partner Noah Baumbach he provides his cast of heavyweight actors many of whom are returning from his previous movies an endless amount of material to play with. If youll pardon the water pun though Anderson is drowning in superficial details. Hes too obsessed with minutiae at the expense of substantive character development. Yes the three-story-tall rendering of Steves 70s era hunk of a boat the Belafonte is impressive all sliced open down the middle for us to peer inside as if it were a dollhouse. And its a hoot to watch Bill Murray as the Cousteau-like explorer of the films title running around the boat with a gun in his hand chasing Filipino pirates while wearing nothing more than a light-blue robe a blue Speedo and flip-flops. But too often Anderson seems interested in weirdness for weirdness sake. Theres one guy on the crew (Seu Jorge who played Knockout Ned in ""City of God"") whose entire job consists of sitting on deck and singing Portuguese versions of David Bowie songs while playing the acoustic guitar. And his renditions are lovely but afterward its hard to escape the nagging feeling of what was the point of that? Other members of Team Zissou as theyre called include engineer Klaus (Willem Dafoe whos sort of sweet in an uncharacteristically goofy comedic role); Steves wealthy wife Eleanor (an eccentrically regal Anjelica Huston) whos universally known as the brains of the operation; and the newest member Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson Andersons longtime friend and collaborator) a true Southern gentleman who only recently approached Steve with the news that he might be the famous explorers son. Ned comes aboard after leaving his job as a pilot for Air Kentucky airlines (their hub is Louisville in case youre wondering) and soon falls in love with the pregnant and glowing journalist Jane Winslett Richardson (a pregnant and glowing Cate Blanchett) whos writing a piece on Team Zissous latest mission hunting down the jaguar shark that ate Steves best friend and partner Esteban (Seymour Cassel another Anderson regular). Neds job pretty much is to hold the boom mike during Steves documentary shoots and yell observations like ""Ive never seen so many electric jellyfish in all my life"" (Its a completely different role for Wilson all wide-eyed innocence without a drop of smug irony.) He also helps provide a father-son subplot for Steves films which may or may not be genuine but that doesnt matter. Steve isnt above faking footage or stealing equipment from his slick rival Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) whose shiny white behemoth of a ship looks like an Ian Schrager hotel on the high seas. Steve Zissou is a great showy role written especially for Murray an Anderson favorite since ""Rushmore."" He gets to be cocky and self-serious vulnerable and more than a little childish. Outwardly Steve seems stoic and slightly mad. Inwardly we are to presume that hes at least vaguely interested in the son that Ned offers himself to be and were expected to believe that the feeling is mutual. But we never truly believe that because the films structure and self-consciousness keep us at arms length. We cared about Max Fischer and Margaret Yang in ""Rushmore"" (and Murrays character Herman Blume) because they were allowed to express real emotions. Here so much dialogue is delivered in such deadpan fashion its hard to know whats real and whats part of the gimmick. Like the films fake fish - rainbow-colored creatures with fabricated names which were created using stop-motion animation - ""The Life Aquatic"" is endlessly fascinating to watch but if you look closer theres not much there. ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" a Touchstone Pictures release is rated R for language some drug use violence and partial nudity. Running time 118 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.

What does that mean? That he might be something one day. Anderson partisans may safely argue that the 35-year-old is quite something already an endearingly fussy craftsman of droll melancholy comedies that dissect the vicissitudes of friendship and family ties unfolding within hermetic Cornell-box worlds of vintage pop and meticulously nostalgic art design. Alas Andersons fourth feature (the product of a hard winters shoot in Italy) may do little to correct Thomsons irresolution. Despite its typically painstaking attentions to elaborate set dressings and assignations of quirk The Life Aquatic meanders and stalls in its journeys with ocean explorer Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) a down-at-heel Cousteau-manque pursuing a filmed revenge mission against the jaguar shark who devoured his best friend.Suffused with lush yet faded primary colours like a 30-year-old Kodak snap and spiced with Henry Selicks stop-motion animations and a starry (if often idle) cast of supporting players The Life Aquatic is a beautifully appointed but airless dollhouse-by-the-sea populated by wistful figurines in their matching little red caps and Team Zissou Adidas and scored to Seu Jorges deckside acoustic renditions of Bowie songs in Portuguese. The movie pokes along in a manner at once listless and affable like a series of semi-improvised outtakes that didnt quite gel. And yet the director magically conjures emotional dividends in the films invigorating last moments which wordlessly celebrate an underrated and truly Andersonian virtue solidarity.

Share Tweet Aging never quite suits the characters in the comedies of Wes Anderson the reigning auteur of arrested development Theyre either too precocious for youth like Jason Schwartzman in Rushmore or too old for their youthful precociousness like the Tenenbaum children in The Royal Tenenbaums. And once theyre past middle age like Gene Hackman in Tenenbaums or Bill Murray in Rushmore and the new The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou lifes disappointments have grown so numerous and profound that they dont even bother to shave anymore. With The Life Aquatic a mopey meta-comedy about growing old and making movies the 35-year-old Anderson suggests the melancholia of directors twice his age though hes a mere four films into a bright and promising career. Theres always been an undercurrent of sadness in Andersons work but never has it been more pronounced and never has it served as such a heavy anchor to the delicate whimsical hijinks on the surface. Like its weary hero the film sometimes seems sapped of energy even defeated in spite of moments as vibrant and magical as any movie this year. Still the boy with the snappiest model train set on the block Anderson casts Murray as a long-in-the-tooth Jacques Cousteau surrogate who still manages his devoted crew on an antiquated ship that looks like a scrupulously designed Barbie Dream House. Less devoted to science than to show Murray and the rest of Team Zissou--including his wife Anjelica Huston German deckmate Willem Dafoe bond-company stooge Bud Cort free interns from the University Of Northern Alaska and a guy who sings David Bowie tunes in Portuguese among others--have fallen on hard times as audiences for their documentaries have dwindled. After a ""jaguar shark"" kills his right-hand man on an expedition Murray and his men take to the seas in search of revenge though financiers balk at the mission. The production gets kick-started when Owen Wilson who may or may not be Murrays grown son offers his inheritance money but their adventures meet many obstacles all noted in painful detail by accompanying journalist Cate Blanchett. With its story about a filmmaker nearing the end of his creative life plagued by middling reviews wary backers and the threat of mutiny from the crew The Life Aquatic seems odd coming from the most acclaimed young comedic director of his generation. But Anderson has a strong emo streak which surfaces in Murrays broken relationships--with his wife who was once married to his arch-nemesis (Jeff Goldblum); with his would-be son whom he never knew; with Dafoe who worships him like a spurned lapdog; and with Blanchett who resists his tired advances. For a movie so consumed by colorful and frivolous touches The Life Aquatic breathes a heavy sigh of resignation though the beautiful ending goes a long way toward justifying all that navel-gazing. Mostly the film delights with its scrupulous minor details The pastel animated sea life the onboard dolphin ""scouts"" that have never lived up to their billing and the hilariously second-rate action sequences which look like they were staged by Rushmores Max Fischer Players. Even when caught in a rut Andersons obsessive vision still yields many exhilarating surprises.

With all that money hes chosen to branch out try something new. Filmed in Italy and on the Mediterranean this movie has a broader canvas than Rushmore The Royal Tenenbaums and Bottle Rocket. It also plays at being an adventure tale. It has pirates gun fights chases an explosion and a giant man-eating fish though all of this is staged with a wink. Its still a Wes Anderson movie in all the important ways. The story centers around a father figure/misfit (again played by Bill Murray who starred in Rushmore). Hes surrounded by an unconventional dysfunctional family of sorts -- a recurring theme in Andersons movies. And the Houston-born director has reassembled his own filmmaking family of familiar faces including Owen Wilson who has appeared in all his movies. Why then does The Life Aquatic feel ... off? Andersons films all have quirky characters pacing and a distinctive tone of detached irony. You either get it or you dont. And if you get it you cant help but feel part of an exclusive club -- youre hip. But this take on undersea adventure movies though studded with amusing bits feels smug and self-satisfied as if the quirkiness no longer is merely a by-product of the way Anderson views the world. Hes trying too hard. Perhaps significant this is Andersons first film that Wilson didnt co-write. His collaborator this time is Noah Baumbach (Kicking and Screaming and Mr. Jealousy). Whatever the reason the movie crosses way over the line separating ironic detachment from catalepsy. Murray plays Steve Zissou a Jacques Cousteau-type adventurer whos at a crossroads. Not only does he fear that hes washed up but also a much-loved member of his crew (Seymour Cassell) has been eaten by a shark. Zissou stages one last adventure He will hunt down the shark and kill it. On the eve of his journey hes visited by a young man Ned (Wilson) who may be his son. Zissou makes Ned a member of his crew and gives him his name. Also along for the ride is a pregnant journalist (Cate Blanchett) who draws the interest of both Ned and Zissou. The crew includes Willem Dafoe as a pouty German engineer; Anjelica Huston as Zissous wife the only member with brains; and Brazilian actor Seu Jorge (City of God) whos mostly shown strumming a guitar and singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese. Anderson uses the Brechtian technique of repeatedly calling attention to the fact that what youre watching isnt real. A tour of his ship for instance is clearly filmed on a soundstage with the ship cut in half so that we can see all the chambers. And most of the aquatic life we see is fake -- old-fashioned stop-motion animation done by Henry Selick who directed The Nightmare Before Christmas. Further distancing us from the story is the way it plays with levels of self-awareness and documentary ""realism."" Zissou makes documentaries about his adventures (were first informed of the shark attack in a documentary shown in premiere). While hunting the shark and dealing with personal crisis the characters simultaneously are performing for the documentary cameras. Life Aquatic meanwhile is partly presented as if it is a documentary with titled sections and the bad cuts that used to be common to the genre before documentaries went upscale. Add trademark ironic line deliveries by Murray and Wilson and the chances of actually getting into the story and caring about any character become almost nil.

Hackman all energy and sly menace was the mesmerizing central figure in Andersons last film the brilliant ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" It was a kind of Homeric odyssey of family dysfunction set among a rich twisted clan of New Yorkers. Hackman a father who was both merry and clearly from hell made it snap crackle and pop. Dilute with water Bill Murray plays a dysfunctional oceanographer interviewed here by Cate Blanchetts journalist out for revenge in ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.""

Its not that Murray isnt a great comic actor. He is. But even though hes worked with Anderson before hes weirdly wrong for this role. Somehow his passivity -- his stock in trade his signature usually a beloved asset -- seems to open a hole in the center of the story. He never seems as dynamic or as demonic as Hackman and the cast around him isnt given much to act against. His diffidence hamstrings the movie. He has the weight of smoke or fog; just as you get close to him he seems to separate. He plays Steve Zissou a kind of low-rent shabby would-be Jacques Cousteau (now thats a funny idea). Headquartered on an island somewhere in the Mediterranean he is the star-producer-director of listless scuba-adventure documentaries though it soon becomes clear that he doesnt know or care much about the ocean or what happens under it. If he once had passion hes now lost it and the film opens at a film festival with his latest production a comically lame story of his adventures encountering the never-seen ""jaguar shark"" which kills his best friend. Anderson whos evidently been to a few of these has a wondrous touch with the absurdities of the life festivalistic especially from the losers end. People stream out of the screening and afterward in a mostly empty auditorium at the Q and A there are very few Qs and the As from the ridiculous Steve (his trademark is the French mariners little red knit hat) are unfocused or emotionally blunt. When he announces that his new film will be about his attempt to track down the jaguar shark and kill it hes asked by an offended animal lover What would be the point? Its Murrays best moment -- perhaps thats why its in all the ads -- as his face knits in surprise that such stupidity is allowed and he blurts without thought in a tone of absolute comic-intense moral certainty ""Revenge."" The rest of the film follows that voyage in a more or less loopy fashion bringing in vivid characters and sharp situations that dominate then disappear. With typical Anderson brio the characters never hem or haw They just state their naked desires deadpan so that we always know where they are where they stand what they want. Michael Gambon has a brilliantly funny turn as Zissous moneyman a cosmopolitan charmer of dubious morality who has all the mannerisms of an old Brit theater queen. Then theres Steves estranged wife Eleanor played by Anjelica Huston in a snit of utter disinterest in her hubby; his first mate the pathetic loony Klaus (Willem Dafoe); some much-abused interns; a gal who never puts her blouse on; and finally Cate Blanchett as a journalist who comes aboard the ship -- called ""The Belafonte"" and if you dont see the humor in that maybe this isnt the movie for you -- to do either a puff piece or a rip job depending. But the dramatic crux of the story (well to the extent that it is dramatic and has a crux) is the arrival of Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson Andersons longtime chum and collaborator) who may or may not be Steves son from a one-nighter 29 years earlier. Ned and Steve spar and almost bond compete over Blanchett (pregnant at the time of filming so the pregnancy is built into the character) hunt the giant shark loot a more prosperous oceanographers lab flub around in the water a lot and observe interesting computerized fish specimens whose cartooniness helps establish the not terribly serious tone. Its funny when Zissou snaps ""Intern Campari and ice"" instead of providing the sentimentalized mentoring that internships are officially about. Its funny when the aggrieved Klaus become jealous of Ned and slaps him. Ned retorts by threatening. Then Ned slaps him. Thats not fair Klaus explains huffily Slap equals threat. But another slap throws the whole apparatus out of equilibrium. Then surprisingly the tone shifts somewhat. Pirates attack kidnap somebody theres violence -- Steve kills one in a gunfight -- and suddenly were in life-and-death straits. Still Anderson plays this for laughs -- almost. This development introduces an element of mortality into the film and later when a major character dies its stunning but somehow not unexpected. The pirate sequence essentially is a passage by which the Belafonte sails from comedy to reality. ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" never quite comes together. Its not merely the sudden shift of tone or the star as the man who never was its that the film seems more an accumulation of moments -- many of them hilarious -- than a consciously crafted story. At the end of the zany ""Royal Tenenbaums"" you knew youd seen something. In this one you walk out thinking Now what the hell was that all about? The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity drug use violence and nudity.

By Anthony Lane The new Wes Anderson picture ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" features Bill Murray as Steve Zissou plus a shoal of other stars. It is impossible to imagine an Anderson project with a single refulgent name gleaming above the title. His movies appear to be modelled on theme parties with as many performers as possible invited along. What the theme of ""The Life Aquatic"" might be is still a mystery although I suspect that it concerns the perils of being all at sea. Everybody here seems adrift. First there is Zissou himself who for years has captained a series of adventures both oceanographic and landlocked (how readily one can picture him lost in space) funding them from the documentary films that he shoots en route. His crew which includes a Sikh cameraman and an Australian technician is loyal to a fault with Klaus the German deckhand (Willem Dafoe) being an especially fine study in resentful slavishness. There is also Steves business partner who is an indispensable part of the setup until he meets a giant jaguar shark and becomes for all practical purposes lunch. Steve sets off after the shark to avenge the ingestion of his friend. He already has considerable experience of large luminous man-eaters having been married to one for years. Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) a stately figure with lagoon-blue streaks in her hair has long been the brains behind the Zissou operation. In a fresh twist of the knife she has recently taken up with Steves richer and more oleaginous rival Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) who was once married to her himself. ""Weve never really made great husbands have we?"" he asks Steve adding ""I mean I have a good excuse. Im part gay."" Steve is unfazed. ""Supposedly everyone is"" he replies. Only by raiding one of Hennesseys marine-research facilities (at which point Anderson himself is raiding his memories of James Bond I would guess) can Steve equip himself for the shark hunt--his rusty heartfelt hopelessly compromised exercise in Ahab Lite. A lot goes on in ""The Life Aquatic"" without much really happening. There are pirates and shootouts; there is a mutter of mutiny; above all there is a mournful subplot which may or may not gesture toward the Marina of Shakespeares ""Pericles"" in which a wave-borne father is reacquainted with a lost child. At the launch party for his latest film Steve is approached by Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) a pilot for the scary-sounding Air Kentucky who claims to be the product of a liaison in Steves past. Nonplussed for a moment Steve soon reverts to his state of superplussed cool introducing the new arrival with the words ""Oh and this is probably my son Ned."" After ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" both of them graced by Bill Murray we have grown accustomed to the unassailable claims of deadpan although Andersons detractors might argue that underreaction having begun as a show of hipness has now frozen into a mannerism. What chance remains they would ask for the venting of genuine feeling? What would it take to harry these controlled characters into grief or the silliness of bliss or unconsidered rage? These are fair points. You sense that some stretches of action in ""The Life Aquatic"" are being lightly held within quotation marks; the clash with the pirates say which starts on board and continues on shore may be desperate and bloody yet an unmistakable air of playacting mingles with the gunsmoke. On the other hand nobody could leave ""The Life Aquatic"" without the impression of having nearly drowned in some secret and melancholy game. Why for example do almost all the characters avail themselves of the opportunity to don a uniform? Is Anderson quietly signalling that he is ready and willing to helm a Second World War movie? He would certainly warm to the idea of young men having to team up dress up and grow up in a hurry since one of the more endearing things about him--and this presumably makes him a highly suspect creature in Hollywood waters--is that for a young director he seems increasingly unbothered by the problems of youth. The most representative line in the new picture comes from a rueful Zissou ""I know I havent been at my best this past decade."" Even the hero of ""Rushmore"" though nominally a teen-ager radiated a grave perplexity as if he could not understand why one should have to wait until midlife to enjoy ones crisis. Then came Gene Hackman in ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and now Bill Murray in ""The Life Aquatic"" both of them grizzled and itchy with bewilderment. It is true that Hackman was seen whizzing around on a go-cart and that Murray is most at ease in flippers as if he were part porpoise but there is all the difference in the world between living a happy childhood and the pathos of pretending to replay it. It is heartening to reflect that the best of Bill Murray may be yet to come. These days he is a wiser and a madder man; his ennui has lost any trace of a pose and he sits around (for a tall guy he can look oddly squat verging on the shrunken) as if wearing an invisible T-shirt that says ""I Told You So."" The best thing about ""The Life Aquatic"" is the skill with which it plays off that instinctive disillusion against the verve of Steve who is required by profession to be not just an optimist but a marveller. The character of Zissou has plainly evolved from Jacques Cousteau whose underwater explorations in the nineteen-fifties and sixties now strike us as the last gasp of world-thirsty innocence when the ecosystem was still something to goggle at rather than fret about. Hence the grace notes of unlikely nostalgia that litter Andersons movie the creaky old computers on board ship; the blacktie audience that awaits the premiere of the latest Zissou film; the gorgeous tour of his beloved vessel the Belafonte that is cut away like a toy boat in cross-section for our delight; and the bracing presence of Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) a blond British reporter from another age who for a while cannot quite bring herself to curse. Just to complete the mix there is David Bowie. Not in person--there are limits to this movies weirdness--but in Portuguese. One of the crew Pele dos Santos (Seu Jorge) likes to hang out in the crows nest or wherever doodling on his guitar and crooning relaxed little riffs on ""Space Oddity"" or ""Rebel Rebel."" At one wondrous point Steve walks the length of the boat by night up toward the bow; something has been playing in the background and now it flames into the open--""Life on Mars?"" in its original form a song that has had ample time to grow cheesy but which by the mysterious workings of pop has grown more triumphantly sad with the years. What matters is that Steve is still in aftershock; that first encounter with Ned has barely subsided and all the emotional noise that was tamped down by civilized aplomb is now let loose through Bowies keening interplanetary chorus. Anderson is doing the opposite of what most directors aim for he is using music not for big crunch-time scenes but for small chewy scraps of experience like a stroll on deck--not to lend them an importance they dont deserve but to suggest that they might in retrospect turn out to be big after all. The best way to treat ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" is as half of a double bill matched with Brad Silberlings ""Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events."" Current hearsay states that the latter is some sort of Harry Potter ripoff but as usual hearsay is wrong. True to its title it is the funereal saga of three children orphaned and wizardless striving to flee the clutches of a maleficent uncle and falling into one noxious trap after another. Like ""The Life Aquatic"" it functions on the principle that messed-up families are funny but only by a whisker. Both movies thanks to special effects feature invertebrates and miniature monsters that have never been glimpsed on this earth (I was much taken with Andersons rhinestone bluefin which is basically Dolly Parton with extra gills). What is more both movies slip the moorings of time and place entering dark waters of their own invention; the cars in Silberlings film hail from the nineteen-fifties but his fourteen-year-old heroine--played by the astounding Emily Browning who is easily nonchalant enough and mature enough to wander into a Wes Anderson tale--dresses like a close friend of Edgar Allan Poe. Silberling sets his story in a gothically Europeanized America whereas Anderson closes his with a Jamesian vision of Americans in Europe Bill Murray in a tuxedo on a warm night descending the steps of an Italian town with a child borne aloft on his shoulders. Each work may be wrapped in a stylized gloom but that style unfolds with such intricate wit that you wind up against expectation more heartened than depressed. As Jane Winslett-Richardson would say what an effing good combination.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Starring Bill Murray Owen Wilson and Cate Blanchett. Directed by Wes Anderson. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Onscreen Bill Murray has the deep revolving sadness of a man who expects to be treated like a hero while possessing none of the qualities that would command such a reaction. This incongruity -- this disconnect between self- conception and reality -- has always been at the source of his comedy but its also what makes him more than simply funny. Even as we laugh we recognize the bitterness and disenchantment as genuine. Who could have guessed when Murray was in his 20s that hed grow into the best comic exemplar of middle-aged misery since W.C. Fields? In ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" director Wes Anderson takes Murray -- an emissary from the land of prose -- and drops him into a poetic landscape. ""The Life Aquatic"" is a childrens book of a movie with the interior logic of a dream full of vibrant colors and fantastic visuals. And in the midst of it keeping all of it from flying away is Murray with his sad-sack satiric face playing an undersea documentarian going through a personal and professional crisis. Its almost a great movie. For half of its running time Anderson maintains a distinct and arresting tone of vague absurdity and then he loses control and the film begins to dip into silliness. Individual scenes become labored. Yet even at its worst ""The Life Aquatic"" is always interesting -- theres really nothing else like it. Although its humor is shrewd and arch the world of ""The Life Aquatic"" is so thoroughly imagined that its hard not to feel on the receiving end of a generous act. It seems the product of a uniquely pure impulse. Murray plays Steve Zissou a latter-day Jacques Cousteau who premieres his latest undersea documentary at an Italian film festival. The audience is indifferent. He hasnt had a hit in years and hes having difficulty raising money for his next project a search for a leopard-spotted man-eating shark. Meanwhile his marriage to a former heiress (Anjelica Huston) is falling apart and a young man Ned (Owen Wilson) who may be his son has surfaced. Anderson (""The Royal Tenenbaums"") renders Zissous island compound in meticulous detail. Other directors provide just enough detail so that audiences will buy it. Anderson piles on details so that the audience gets a complete sense of life as its lived. Theres a shot -- it probably doesnt last three seconds -- of Murray feeding fish to a whale in a tank. So Steve has a pet whale. In another shot in which Murray is really doing nothing but walking into a room there are birds flying around him. So birds have gotten loose. Are these details important? Theyre not necessary but in a cumulative sense yes they are important. At the very least to see a movie as textured as ""The Life Aquatic"" is to realize the thinness of the usual fare. The film is often quite funny but there are no bits and no punch lines. Laughing at any point makes about equal sense. ""Sorry I didnt acknowledge your existence all those years"" Steve tells the man who might be his son. ""It wont happen again."" The low-key comic style lets the audience notice the absurdity while allowing the actors to play the emotions straight. Thus Murray and Wilson are able to achieve a father-son poignancy in their interaction even though most of their scenes are intentionally and faintly ridiculous. Murrays scenes with Cate Blanchett work similarly. She plays a virtual parody of a crusading journalist a five-months-pregnant magazine writer interviewing Steve for a ""cover story"" a prospect that fills him with hope and paranoia. Their conversations satirize the tortured dance of celebrities and reporters. Yet ""The Life Aquatic"" also takes us into the pain of a working woman on her own pregnant by a married lover. It was probably too much to expect the film to stay like this hovering in a happy limbo introducing and revealing characters. When the plot kicks in -- specifically when pirates show up -- ""The Life Aquatic"" goes off the rails and never completely recovers. Still until the finish there are white dolphins and animated sea creatures and Murrays face. Theres always something to look at. -- Advisory This film contains nudity cartoonlike violence and sexual situations.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Wes Anderson Bill Murray Movies or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" the fourth film by idiosyncratic filmmaker Wes Anderson is the directors most ambitious film to date.Andersons previous efforts -- ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) ""Rushmore"" (1998) and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001) -- have earned him a reputation as one of Hollywoods most distinctive young voices but havent hit with a broad audience (though his fans are extremely loyal). But this time hes been given 50 million -- a good-sized Hollywood budget -- and no doubt the studio is hoping for a commercial success.Still fear not Anderson fans the 35-year-old filmmaker has not sold out to the studio system. Indeed hes just been given a bigger canvas and makes fine use of it.""The Life Aquatic"" is still full of his many trademark flourishes such as a stiffly framed visual style some highly eccentric characters a flair for absurdity and barely hidden quirky cross-references but its also a good comedy with wider appeal.Deadpan precisionThe story for ""The Life Aquatic"" arose from Andersons longtime fascination with oceanographer Jacques Cousteau who the filmmaker confesses he discovered at a young age while watching National Geographic specials.Like Cousteau Andersons title character Steve Zissou -- played with deadpan precision by Bill Murray -- employs his friends and family as the staff for his explorations and underwater documentaries. The same of course could be said for Anderson whos worked with many of the same actors and crew members from the beginning.Zissou is a weary self-involved yet emotionally needy explorer who loses his longtime friend and partner Esteban (Seymour Cassel) during the filming of a deep-sea documentary. It appears the unfortunate Esteban became lunch for a killer ""jaguar"" shark a mutant creature that may -- or may not -- exist.Now on the verge of being a washed-up has-been Zissou is being helped by his heiress wife Eleanor (Angelica Huston) -- routinely called ""the brains of the operation"" -- in his effort to complete his last epic film while at the same time seeking vengeance by finding the killer shark. Zissous ship the Belafonte is shown in life-sized cross-section like a large dollhouse.His crew of misfits includes a fawning German engineer beautifully portrayed by Willem Dafoe in a rare comic role; his septuagenarian producer Oseary Drakoulias (Michael Gambon); a safety expert (who frequently serenades the crew with Portuguese versions of David Bowie songs) Pele dos Santos (Seu Jorge); and a ""bond company stooge"" Bill Ubell (Bud Cort looking almost unrecognizably different from the young actor who starred in ""Harold and Maude"").Also along for the voyage on Zissous ship the Belafonte -- a vessel lovingly showcased as if it were a life-sized dollhouse -- is a mysterious and pregnant journalist played wonderfully by Cate Blanchett and a young Southern gentleman and pilot named Ned Plimpton portrayed by longtime Anderson friend and collaborator Owen Wilson. Plimpton claims to be the long-lost son Zissou never knew he had.Waiting in the wings to foil all of Zissous plans is archrival oceanographer Alistair Hennessey played with barely restrained glee by Jeff Goldblum.If this sounds like a bizarre group remember this is a Wes Anderson film.A treat to watchRather then using any high-tech digital technology for the action at sea Anderson elected to create the films absurd world by using old fashion stop-action animation. The movie therefore has a handmade look that is perfect for Andersons off-center point-of-view including cleverly animated -- and very colorful -- sea creatures.""The Life Aquatic"" was shot along the Italian coastline and near Rome at the legendary Cinecitta studios. The locations give the film a continental atmosphere that would have been impossible to achieve in California which adds to its off-kilter feel.But with all of Andersons tricks and playthings spinning around is ""Life Aquatic"" a movie? Well the plot may seem a little sluggish for those unfamiliar with the director and the comedy askew. But as with all Anderson movies ""The Life Aquatic"" is character driven and -- though those characters are far from standard -- theyre a treat to watch. Both Murray and Wilson are perfect for Andersons eccentric worldview and play off each other wittily and well. It remains to be seen whether Anderson can appeal to a wider audience while still pleasing his core fans but this sometimes fanciful high-seas action/adventure flick should please both loyalists and newcomers.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Do not open til Christmas - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Do not open til ChristmasLaughs sink under weight of films conceptTHE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU (star)(star)December 24 2004|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.Wes Andersons ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou""--in which Bill Murray plays a shaggy-dog American version of oceanographer-film-maker Jacques-Yves Cousteau--is a comedy that seems to have most everything going for it but the ability to make us laugh. Despite its cast and director its an amazingly unfunny movie drowned in its own conceits half-strangled by the tongue so obtrusively in its cheek.Anderson the writer-director of ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is the master of a special type of American movie comedy--dry deadpan and very smart--and Ive liked all his movies up to now. But something has definitely gone awry with ""Aquatic"" beginning with its clumsy title the Murray characters silly half Cousteauish name and the sillier name of his ship. (Cousteaus boat was the Calypso; Zissous is the Belafonte a weak gag on calypso singer Harry.) ""The Life Aquatic"" is full of action sopo-.rific and jokes anemic.The movie filmed in an odd style with a lot of animation is about a hapless ""Moby Dick-ish"" filmed ocean adventure in which the aging famous but recently flop-ridden underwater documentarian Steve Zissou (Murray) takes his trusted crew and a few newcomers on an obsessive sea hunt.His Ahab-esque goal to avenge on camera the death by jaguar shark attack of his beloved assistant Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassell).Along the way more complications and adventures pile up--including a Filipino pirate attack and kidnapping the appearance of Steves formidable wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) a sea-going rivalry with slimy Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) and Steves weird bonding with courtly Kentuckian Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who claims to be his long-lost son and also becomes Steves rival for the sexual favors of pregnant British magazine journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett).Other characters trapped in the bizarre would-be comic quest include Steves boot-licking German mate Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe) his shady producer Oseary Drakoulias (Michael Gambon) the bond company stooge Bill Ubell (Bud Cort of ""Harold and Maude"") and Steves usual crew of filmmakers musicians and assistants. (Among the elements ""Aquatic"" wastes are a score by Devos Mark Mothersbaugh and original songs by David Bowie mysteriously sung here in Portuguese.)For a would-be comedy-satire-adventure ""Aquatic"" is alarmingly somnolent and unexciting; Murray seems to drag his way through the movie in a state of near torpor that hardly suggests a vengeance-driven maniac. (Even so he gets some laughs.) And Anderson has decided to convey the Belafontes mission on a toylike beehive set mostly avoiding the real ocean and using animated fish by Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"").Its an interesting half-charming idea not unlike the stylized Manhattan of ""Tenenbaums"" and its often realized with skill and imagination. But eventually this artificiality combined with the mostly deadpan acting tends to suggest a 50s TV kiddie show gone horribly wrong. By the time of the pirate attack with glowering villains waving what seem to be toy plastic guns the movie had lost me.In Andersons two best movies ""Rushmore"" and his delightful debut film ""Bottle Rocket"" there was an exhilarating contrast between the stylized deadpan comic performances he got from Wilson and others and the somewhat real backgrounds. Now that hes won bigger budgets and the ability to create his own private worlds he may be getting trapped in them.That doesnt mean ""Aquatic"" doesnt have its moments. It means that were disappointed at their rarity.""Rushmore"" and ""Tenenbaums"" were daringly dark and screwy family comedies. But the humor here seems inbred the jokes so seemingly private and referential (""Plimpton"" suggests the late writer/editor George) that they barely exist as jokes. Most of the actors starting with Murray seem tired and confused--and its hard to blame them.In this enviable cast most of whom have a few grace moments only Blanchett whose spark may be unquenchable manages unfailing effervescence and energy.Most damaging of all is the lack of much sense of real sea air wind and waves to create an arena for Andersons flights of fancy. ""Life Aquatic"" in the end is just too dry.`The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou(star)(star)Directed by Wes Anderson; written by Anderson Noah Baumbach; photographed by Robert Yeoman; edited by David Moritz; production designed by Mark Friedberg; music by Mark Mothersbaugh with songs by David Bowie; animation by Henry Selick; produced by Wes Anderson Barry Mendel Scott Rudin.

"The Life Aquatic is a shallow adventure - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW The Life Aquatic is a shallow adventure By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 24 2004 Theres a man at a party and you know the person Im talking about. Hes always at the center of the room engaging in clever banter. Hes gifted yet self-deprecating; artistic but modest. He wears interesting socks. Some at this party think hes the most spellbinding individual theyve ever met. Others see affectation a mere show; they note that his eyes catch his own in the mirror more than those of anybody hes talking to.If that party is the movies then that man is writer-director Wes Anderson. Some have hailed the maker of ""Rushmore"" (1998) and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001) as the savior of American independent film; others -- myself included -- have wondered where exactly is the beef. Those movies are alternately droll and unwatchable in their calculated whimsy in the secondhand solipsism they lift wholesale from J.D. Salinger (""The Catcher in the Rye"" is a great book but can we finally admit it has been responsible for more privileged adolescent self-pity than a culture deserves?) and in the directors unwillingness to commit to anything as dull as plot.With the exception of his first film ""Bottle Rocket"" (1996) Anderson hasnt made a movie thats more than the sound of a young man talking to himself. With ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" (opening tomorrow) he has run out of things to say.The films meta-fey title alone is an example of why some people adore Anderson and why he drives others absolutely crazy. Its also the name of the underwater-adventure documentary series that oceanographer Zissou (Bill Murray) has been filming for 20 years the latest installment of which is greeted with abject silence at the Santo Loquasto Film Festival in the opening sequences of ""Aquatic."" (And if you get the in-joke that Santo Loquasto is the name of Woody Allens longtime production designer well . . . self-congratulation is its own reward I guess.)Clearly Zissou -- a kind of Jacques Cousteau in the throes of a midlife crisis -- has seen better days. His right-hand man (Seymour Cassell too briefly seen) has been eaten by a rare jaguar shark that may or may not exist. His producer (Michael Gambon) cant get funding for the next ""Life Aquatic"" film. His wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) is the real brains of Team Zissou and has just left him. His scientific rival (Jeff Goldblum) is better funded and better dressed (hes also Eleanors ex-husband). All that keeps Zissous ego fed is the needy faithfulness of his German engineer Klaus (Willem Dafoe) and the appearance of an airline pilot (Owen Wilson) who may or may not be his illegitimate son.The trailers for ""Life Aquatic"" are hilarious and for good reason -- they highlight the films brief inventive spasms of wit and excise the wall-to-wall mopiness. Anderson likes to make movies about entropy about once-heroic lives devolving into stasis and dysfunctional family groups drifting apart. Fine. He also likes characters who are so self-absorbed and prickly as to be hard to warm up to Max Fischer in ""Rushmore"" Royal Tenenbaum certainly Murrays Zissou. Also fine. Less fine is Andersons inability to fashion a movie that doesnt feel insanely fussed over on the surface and listless beneath. Team Zissous ocean-going laboratory ship the Belafonte is visualized in a cutaway set that feels like a kids balsa-wood model; its neat to look at but serves no dramatic purpose other than to showcase the directors flair. Brazilian actor-singer Seu Jorge from ""City of God"" has been hired to sit on the deck and sing David Bowie songs in Portuguese; its cute exactly once. The eccentric animator Henry Selick (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") provides oddball CGI deep-sea creatures that dash around the edges of the film like appetizers for a meal that never comes.When the director turns his attention to narrative -- to things happening -- he trips over his own feet. Theres a plotline about Filipino pirates taking over the Belafonte and kidnapping a crew member (Bud Cort of ""Harold and Maude"" finally the right age for Ruth Gordon) which allows Zissou to stage a mission to rescue both the crew member and his own self-worth. But the rescue sequences are tatty and fumbled not even worthwhile as a parody of action movies. And the central relationship between Zissou and Ned his possible son is so underwritten as to vanish into the mist.Underacted too. For once Wilson lacks his customary slacker charisma and when this actor isnt winking hes helpless. Cate Blanchett as a pregnant reporter who becomes Neds romantic interest does bring focus and vibrancy to the proceedings and Huston and Goldblum are pros in their too-few scenes. Dafoe has a comic role for once and its fun to see him play a Teutonic nerd.But Bill Murray is simply lost. The beloved comedian arches his puppy-dog eyes like he did in ""Lost in Translation"" but where he was playing an actual character in Sofia Coppolas film here he merely assumes the weary hostility for which he has been so well rewarded in the past. This is amusing but not what you would call acting. For starters to be ironically detached you need something to be detached from and the superficial pleasures of ""Life Aquatic"" are far too slippery to offer traction.Wes Anderson is often held up as the litmus test of modern American independent filmmaking. In truth he has become the poster boy for its limitations for an insularity and ""quirkiness"" that allows intelligent filmgoers to feel better about themselves at the risk of real passion and real art. Until Anderson can locate that passion -- for life for movies for anything besides brittle disenchantment -- he will remain a talented miniaturist and the party he plays to will slowly dwindle to one.

Go ahead. Start throwing stuff. Write ""Kick Me"" on a piece of paper and tape it to my back. Its not what you want to hear I know. I liked Wes Andersons latest movie which stars Bill Murray but I wanted to like it more. Theres a lot to enjoy in this seagoing comedy including the Brazilian guy (Seu Jorge from ""City of God"") who throughout the movie sings breathy samba versions of 1970s David Bowie songs. You havent lived until youve heard ""Rebel Rebel"" with a mournful midnight-in-Rio flavor. But for the most part ""Life Aquatic"" hovers frustratingly somewhere between charming and only mildly amusing. Michael Gambon from left Willem Dafoe Bill Murray Anjelica Huston and Waris Ahluwalia take off on an ocean adventure in Wes Andersons ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.""

He sails around the world with a devoted crew (on the Belafonte a ship converted from a submarine) filming his oceanographic endeavors and selling them as documentaries. But lately interest in Steves films seems to be dwindling. He cant get money for the next installment of his series. Steve decides its time to spice up his operation for the cameras. So he decides to take revenge on the elusive jaguar shark that took his friend and top diver Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassel) at the end of Part One. And when Navy man Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) appears in Steves life claiming to be his long-lost son Steve figures thatll put some reality-TV melodrama into the proceedings. Ned shows the kind of emerging leadership a father would hope of a son. And Steves newfound affection for him makes the ships very Germanic engineer Klaus (Willem Dafoe) jealous. Steve is plagued by a rival on the seas Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) who commands a slick vessel complete with uniformed minions and is the ex-husband of Steves wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston). Theres a quirky and pregnant English journalist (Cate Blanchett apparently unable to completely shake off her Katharine Hepburn shtick from ""The Aviator"") who seems to be trying to discredit Steve. And theres a bond company stooge (Bud Cort) aboard who may only be in the movie as a salute to Corts role in the 1971 ""Harold and Maude."" Murray who has now appeared in three Anderson films including the wonderful ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is the movies best hope a deadpan shaggy seadog who watches this oddball world around him with a mixture of world-weariness and detached amusement. But most of the other characters seem to have been implanted arbitrarily -- even for a story thats already about serendipity and arbitrariness. They are single-trait beings one-dimensional quirkos and Murray brushes through them like a kid kicking through leaves. You dont feel much in the way of meaningful character interaction although Wilson comes the closest as the goofy prodigal son. But given Wilsons terrific presence as Dignan in Andersons debut ""Bottle Rocket"" he is a mild disappointment. Ultimately ""Life Aquatic"" is a potboiler that doesnt seem pressed to do more than bubble contentedly. The small-scale gags riffs and motifs that worked so brightly in ""Bottle Rocket"" and the terrific follow-up ""Rushmore"" seem to simmer with less incident here. Its eccentricity for eccentricitys sake. And thats the kind of formula Andersons films are not supposed to be about.

There is a dramatization of Serpico full of terse cop-speak and an Apocalypse Now-influenced Vietnam War saga replete with exploding ammo whirring helicopters and heroic sacrifice.The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou Andersons latest and most fanciful endeavor comes across like an extended theatrical piece by the Max Fischer Players. Starring Bill Murray (Schwartzmans middle-aged mopey foil in Rushmore) the film is full of flatly delivered discourse and elaborately detailed sets and props. The characters to a man - and woman - represent eccentric turns on stock types. Theres even a piracy-on-the-high-seas shootout with bullets flying bodies falling and freak-outs on the poop deck.As Steve Zissou a world-weary oceanographer and nature film producer (think Jacques Cousteau only American not French - rumpled not dapper) Murray moons around in the simultaneous throes of self-doubt and self-absorption. Hes often seen sporting a Team Zissou wetsuit an outfit that makes it hard to take the guy seriously even as he takes himself terribly so.As Life Aquatic begins Zissou is screening his latest oceanographic documentary to an unenthusiastic audience. The crowd perks up a bit when it becomes evident that Zissous old friend and colleague isnt going to reemerge from the depths Zissou reports that hes been eaten - the victim of a deadly ""jaguar shark.""And Zissou against everything he stands for vows that he will hunt down this mysterious killer fish and avenge his colleagues death. As Moby Dick was to Ahab the jaguar shark is to Zissou.Joining the expedition aboard Zissous ship the Belafonte along with the regular crew (Willem Dafoe as an eager-to-please German engineer and Seu Jorge as a guitar-strumming deckhand) are a very British very pregnant journalist (a really pregnant Cate Blanchett raising gum-chewing to an art form) and a young airline pilot (Owen Wilson) who may or may not be the illegitimate son of Captain Zissou.Bud Cort who starred long ago in Harold and Maude - a film thats clearly had an influence on Anderson - also signs on playing a numbers-crunching ""bond-company stooge."" And Anjelica Huston looking wise and winsome appears as Zissous wife supplying counsel and criticism puffing on cigarettes all the while. She also supplies considerable heartache as it appears shes rekindled a relationship with Zissous arch-rival in the underwater exploration game the smirking Alistair Hennessey (the smirking Jeff Goldblum).Like Rushmore and Andersons follow-up The Royal Tenenbaums much of the stuff of Life Aquatic has to do with the relationship between father and son or father figure and son figure; its laden with longing with questions with apology with blame. Ned Plimpton (Wilson) flies for Air Kentucky (hes got the uniform to prove it); as a lad his hero was Zissou. He proudly declares that hes been a member of the Zissou Society since he was 11.The captain escorts his maybe-son on a tour of the Belafonte - a revamped sub-hunter that the audience sees in splendid widescreen cross-section view. (Constructed on the fabled Cinecitta Studio lot in Rome the boat interiors are a network of multilevel dollhouse-like rooms - a lab a kitchen an editing and recording suite a research library an observation bubble.) After a stroll around the ship and a revelatory beachside moment Ned decides to trade in his Air Kentucky hat for a bright-red Team Zissou wool cap.The Life Aquatic doesnt have the charged-up loopiness of Bottle Rocket (Andersons first picture) or Rushmore and Murray - as sublime as he is - is so transcendentally deadpan and melancholic that the performance feels theatrical and remote. In another context this might not be a good thing. But Life Aquatic is all about remoteness (and about ""theater"") so it works. The Life Aquatic is full of moments of strange tranquility and screwball juxtaposition. Like the old and creaky Belafonte the film itself seems forever on the brink of drifting away. But its the kind of drifting thats nothing but enjoyable. In fact its beyond enjoyable - heading into waters full of whimsy mystery and odd psychedelic fish.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Read his recent work at http//go.philly.com/stevenrea.The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou  1/2 (out of four stars)Produced by Wes Anderson Barry Mendel and Scott Rudin directed by Anderson written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach photography by Robert Yeoman music by Mark Mothersbaugh distributed by Touchstone Pictures.Running time 1 hour 58 mins.Steve Zissou. . .

With Bill Murray Cate Blanchett Owen Wilson. Director Wes Anderson (158). R Language nudity. At Lincoln Square. 1.5 Stars. If theres anything more tiresome in film today than hip irony it is forced irony and here comes a boatload with Wes Andersons ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" Make that here comes ""The Life Aquatic"" will Bill Murray the icon of ironic hipsterdom. One needs to be an obsessive Murray fan (and there are many out there) or a true believer in the young genius of Anderson (a growing sect) to find this flat cartoon of a sea adventure even tolerable. Ive been hot and cold on both Anderson whos at his best (""The Royal Tenenbaums"") when he doesnt direct with his tongue in his cheek (""Rushmore"") and Murray whos been brilliant playing off or against his own persona (""Groundhog Day"" ""Lost in Translation""). But Anderson who has switched writing partners from Owen Wilson to Noah Baumbach has set up ""Life Aquatic"" as an elaborate Bill Murray sketch with the star as a Rube Goldberg version of Jacques Cousteau. Murray wears his smugness like a wet suit. Steve Zissou is an undercapitalized ocean explorer who makes mundane egocentric home movies about his adventures. At the opening of ""Life Aquatic"" hes showing his latest film to a black-tie and bored-stiff audience at an Italian film festival. While making that movie Zissous beloved partner was eaten by a rare jaguar shark a moment of bloody drama that his film crew failed to capture. Now hes putting together an expedition to find the shark photograph it and - when no eco-nazis are looking - kill it. Joining the expedition are Zissous regular crew identified by red stocking caps and Z badges plus a pregnant but hard-nosed magazine writer (Cate Blanchett) a bond company overseer (Bud Cort) and Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) a Kentucky pilot who may or may not be Zissous illegitimate son. After you hear Ned speak a few times youll think he may or may not be from Kentucky either. Wilsons accent slips across the border all the way to his native Texas. Zissous guilt-driven relationship with Ned doesnt reach the emotional depths of the father-son team in ""Finding Nemo"" but its as close as Anderson comes to finding a human hook for his seagoing farce. The month-long expedition begins with Zissous robbery of a privately owned sea lab and moves on to absurdly silly run-ins with Filipino pirates and an encounter with a rival explorer (Jeff Goldblum) who happens to be the gay ex-husband of Zissous wife (Anjelica Huston). But most of our time is spent below decks with the crew of Zissous ship the Belafonte. I havent wanted to reach land so badly since ""McHales Navy."" ""Life Aquatics"" sole success is the set design of the Belafonte a full-scale cross section that allows us to see inside every compartment at the same time. From this distance the film looks pretty good.

But is it a movie? Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Wes Andersons ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is like a very elaborate diorama in a shoebox -- which is fine unless you go to it expecting to see a movie. The visuals in ""The Life Aquatic"" are calculated to inspire delight A multicolored candy-striped seahorse hovers placidly in a champagne glass; as a mini-submarine scoots through the water a giant shark decorated with big-cat stripes looms in front of its nose; a ship is glimpsed in a dollhouse-style cross-section so we see the hustle and bustle that goes on in its various rooms and chambers (a visual trick borrowed from the Jerry Lewis picture ""The Ladies Man""). Shot by Robert D. Yeoman (who worked with Anderson on ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and also shot Roman Coppolas sorely underappreciated ""CQ"") with Mark Friedberg as production designer ""The Life Aquatic"" gives us some wowee visuals. But theres no emotional texture to them and the story (written by Anderson and Noah Baumbach) meanders in such a meaningless way that the visual details as carefully wrought as they are come off as mere props. Neither lifelike nor aquatic ""The Life Aquatic"" is static in a weirdly hyperkinetic way. Bill Murray plays the Steve Zissou of the title an aging sea explorer surrounded by a team of researchers (Willem Dafoe and Noah Taylor are two of them) who stick with him through thick and thin. (Zissou outfits them in matching red caps and black turtlenecks; at night they all wear identical pjs.) The world knows Zissou from his Jacques Cousteau-like documentary films (they have titles like ""The Battling Eels of Antibes"") but his fame and influence are on the wane. Worse hes distraught by the recent death of his closest friend and colleague Esteban (Seymour Cassel) who during the making of their last film was bitten in half by a lethal creature with a fanciful name the jaguar shark. Zissou vows revenge on the shark but he has other problems as well A young pilot named Ned (Owen Wilson) shows up on the scene claiming to be Zissous son the product of a long-ago liaison. Plucky pregnant ruddy-faced journalist Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) has become part of his entourage and her questions arent always friendly. And Zissous dismissive blase wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) whom many believe to be the real brains of his operation may have run back to her former husband Zissous chief rival in the undersea-exploration biz spoiled rich guy Alistair Hennessy (Jeff Goldblum). With all those characters crisscrossing one another at every turn youd think thered be a lot going on in ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" But even though the picture does feature a pirate attack (which is surprisingly rough and jostles the tone of the movie) and an island rescue scene in which many of the characters scamper about antically during a shootout very little actually happens in the movie -- its a concept desperately in search of a story. The chief idea I suppose is that Zissou is a cranky loner who pretends to like animals and people but who really cares little for either -- he needs to undergo some sort of transformation. You Might Also Like Its the sort of character Murray always plays superbly (particularly in the 1988 ""Scrooged"") because hes too self-possessed to ever be dopily sentimental. And hes fine here showing threads of grizzled humanity beneath all that deadpan grousing and grumbling. Andersons movies may be self-congratulatory and precociously bratty but hes not a cold director ""The Life Aquatic"" does seem to have been motivated by a generousness of spirit and obviously Anderson is acutely aware of and very interested in tapping whats special about Murray as an actor. And yet the picture just feels too overworked too ""designed"" to resonate emotionally. When Wilsons Ned realizes that Zissou knew of his existence he asks ""Why didnt you contact me?"" Zissou replies ""Because I hated fathers and I never wanted to be one."" Its a snappy line which is precisely the problem At every turn ""The Life Aquatic"" seems far too taken with its own cleverness. Theres no sense of adventure to it nothing in it for us to discover -- everything is handed to us with a well-rehearsed flourish. Thats a shame because the first half-hour or so of ""The Life Aquatic"" seemed to promise something different. The opening sequence shows us archival Zissou footage of Esteban smiling behind his divers mask mugging joyously as a school of hot-pink fish shimmy around him. We like Esteban instantly (He is after all played by Seymour Cassel.) And almost instantly hes dead Somehow looking at that footage we understand exactly what he means to Zissou. And theres something hilarious about the way Hustons Eleanor sidles up to her ex Alistair whos decked out in a jacket encrusted with gaudy medals and purrs ""Hello skinny. Is that a new merit badge?"" Individual instances of Andersons oddball dialogue work very well in ""The Life Aquatic."" Still the picture falls apart scene by scene. The relationships between the characters seem vague and indistinct -- we care about them less instead of more as the picture paddles on. Thats frustrating because its possible that theres a fine idiosyncratically heartfelt little picture buried somewhere in ""The Life Aquatic."" But as young as Anderson is he has already been hailed as an ""original"" which means unfortunately that hes apparently exempt from learning anything about giving his movies some bone structure. Anderson hasnt yet grasped that although novelty is exciting for a time before long it just becomes wearying. ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is overburdened with knowingly charming touches. Its waterlogged with whimsy. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

"The Life Aquatic is shipwrecked. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Life Aquatic is shipwrecked. The Life Aquatic is shipwrecked. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 10 2004 715 PM Capt. Blah Wes Anderson the inert master of The Life Aquatic. By David Edelstein As one of the few cinephiles under age 50 who doesnt drop to his knees at the mention of Wes Anderson I was hoping to like The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou (Touchstone Pictures) if only to prove that Im not wedded to first (or second or third) impressions. But even a lot of Wes-worshippers concede that this one is a mess--a misshapen mawkish tragicomedy bordering on self-parody. Its ambitions deserve respect though. Anderson is attempting to bring his rather precious style to bear on the scope of a great mans life as he stands on the brink of old age and decline. A selfish patriarch losing stature watching his empire break apart was at the heart of The Royal Tenenbaums but this time Anderson wants to be inside his protagonists head and to nudge the usual quaint non-events that make up his plots into something mythic--hilariously deflating (the Anderson reflex) yet at the same time romantic thrilling and heartbreaking. Parodic yet sincere. Thats the design anyway. But as is often the case with Anderson the narrative design is elbowed aside by the production design. A few weeks ago I lauded Pedro Almodovar by citing John Gielguds autobiography to the effect that when an artist learns to do something well he or she must control it and do it more selectively. Anderson is not to put it delicately given to self-control. It would be all too easy to Make Your Own Wes Anderson shot. Put a quirky person dressed in loud but stylish colors in the center of the frame; use a lens that spreads out the image and shortens the distance between foreground and background creating a two-dimensional puppet-stage effect; stick an object or a character off to one side to throw off the symmetry; and voila. Youre in the New York Film Festival. Advertisement At their best Andersons coy frames are moving Theres a tension between the person and the persona as if the character is trapped in the wrong storybook. (Thats whats appealing about the adolescent protagonist of Rushmore--that hes trying to devise a storybook that will do justice to his inner life.) But the framing is a mannerism and often an emotionless one the actors like puppets trying vainly to register inside the overpacked compositions. Its well-known that in The Royal Tenenbaums Gene Hackman chafed at being posed and given line readings; as a result of that lordly resistance (a given with Hackman one of our testier great actors) his performance transcended that frame and held the movie together. As Steve Zissou Bill Murray doesnt pull off the same feat. He tries to underplay soulfully but the lines that Anderson and his brand-new accomplice Noah Baumbach have written him have no soul. Despite his home run in Lost in Translation Murray is a neophyte actor committed only to being noncommittal. He doesnt have the size to play Andersons aging Neptune a Jacques Cousteau-like filmmaker who loses a colleague to a rare ""jaguar shark"" and embarks on a (somewhat embarrassed) Ahab-like quest to track and kill the creature. That you never think of Moby Dick is both a plus and a (postmodern) minus. At the center of The Life Aquatic is a figure who might or might not be Zissous son a young pilot named Ned (Owen Wilson). The father/quasi-son conflict has been an Anderson staple. The kid lost the girl in Rushmore but has had more success ever since. Here he wins the sexual battle but loses the war--in a stupid melodramatic turn that belongs in a different kind of movie. (It gives Anderson a chance to indulge in self pity on both sides of the generation gap.) Father and son fight over Cate Blanchett who certainly does seem worthy of it. In The Aviator she does a seance-worthy Katharine Hepburn; here the voice is an octave higher and shes the soul of a twitty upper class English TV journalist.The Life Aquatic is gorgeous especially if you dig fire-engine red and yellow juxtaposed with aquamarine. Anderson always seems to regard his movies as giant toy chests and for this one he built a marvelous stage a ship with an interior perfectly suited to long tracking shots from compartment to compartment. Its too bad that the characters emerge onto a realistic looking deck beside a realistic coastline. Anderson should have stayed inside that beautiful dollhouse. For better and worse it suits him.

Running time 119 minutes. Rated R (profanity drugs violence partial nudity). At the Lincoln Square Broadway and 68th Street.WES Andersons ""Rush more"" boosted his career as well as Bill Murrays so Anderson wrote a juicy lead part in the in termittently brilliant intermittently hilarious - and occasionally tedious - ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" Murray would seem ideally cast as Zissou a downtrodden American Jacques Cousteau who is drowning in debt after nine years of flop ocean documentaries - and drowning in grief after his closest associate Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassel) is eaten alive by an exotic shark during the filming of his latest epic. After a screening at a film festival in Italy Zissou announces that the upcoming second part of the documentary will cover his hunting down the offending shark and blowing him to bits with dynamite. Money remains a problem but when Zissou meets Ned (Owen Wilson) a young airline pilot from Kentucky who claims to be his son by a recently deceased ex-girlfriend Zissou sees not only a ""relationship subplot"" but an ""equity partner"" willing to pump his 275000 inheritance into Zissous next film. Also along for the ride on Zissous Ahab-like quest is Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) a British journalist for whose favors Zissou and his maybe-son begin vying - despite the fact that shes seven months pregnant with her married editors child. There is no shortage of jealousy on the Belafonte as the ship is known. Zissous growing relationship with Ned upsets engineer Klaus (Willem Dafoe hilariously cast against type) who fancied Zissou as his own father figure. And Zissou himself is seething that his wealthy estranged wife Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) justifiably known as the brains of his operation has lately been hanging out with his well-heeled chief rival Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) who also happens to be her ex-husband. As if that werent distracting enough Zissou is diverted from his mission when pirates board his ship steal Neds money and kidnap the bond company representative (Bud Cort) Zissou was forced to cart along to ensure that he didnt actually kill the shark or commit other illegal acts. While it is undeniably fun watching Murray wield a gun for perhaps the first time in a movie in two action sequences (in one hes wearing Speedos a bathrobe and flip-flops) his benumbed performance here makes his world-weary character in ""Lost in Translation"" look positively manic by comparison. There has always been a fine line between genius and self-indulgence in Andersons movies; while he never crossed it in the brilliant ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" here he repeats jokes endlessly and stops the film ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^dead in the water so we can admire the fastidiously detailed art direction including a full-size cross section of the Belafonte and fantastic fish created by stop-motion animator Henry Selick (""The Nighmare Before Christmas""). This movie has much to admire but it lacks the propulsive pace and emotional investment of Andersons earlier films which were all co-written by Owen Wilson. This one co-scripted instead by Noah Baumbach too often seems like ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zzzzzzzzzissou.""

Even the good-natured spoofing of TV oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in Bill Murrays Steve Zissou is muddled and will disappoint Murray fans leaving pic with little good cheer at the B.O. or later in vid berths. The affectionately confused life that usually pulsates a Wes Anderson film has drifted out to sea in ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou."" Comedy overflows with Andersons signature motifs -- from immature fathers and adult-like children to the storyboard-like arrangement of scenes on screen. But in spite of quasi-action storylines and relatively lavish set pieces project reps a cul-de-sac for the gifted filmmaker. Even the good-natured spoofing of TV oceanographer Jacques Cousteau in Bill Murrays Steve Zissou is muddled and will disappoint Murray fans leaving pic with little good cheer at the Yule B.O. or later in vid berths. Charitable viewers may speculate that the stellar casts half-mast energy and deadpan delivery are all part of Andersons devious strategy to suggest people underwater or to relay Steve Zissous own extremely fatigued sense of himself as man of pop science fame. But the effect is often soporific. Murrays depiction here of the Exhausted Middle-Aged Male is a pale shadow of his over-the-hill actor in ""Lost in Translation."" The energy dip is palpable in the opening sequence set at an Italian film fest devoted to aquatic cinema. In that scene Zissous latest edition to his ongoing series of armchair adventure films titled -- what else? -- ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" preems to an aud dumbfounded by the docus depiction of the bloody death of Steves longtime assistant Esteban du Plantier (Seymour Cassel). Certain that Esteban was swallowed whole by a huge ""Jaguar Shark"" Steve declares that his next project will be filming the hunting and killing of the beast. Anderson loves narrative clutter and piles it on quickly introducing Steves motley international crew including Brazilian singer and ""City of Gods"" Seu Jorge whose only job is to warble a David Bowie song in Portuguese. Also paraded onto Steves exploratory vessel the Belafonte Steves ex-wife and the brains behind Team Zissou Eleanor (Anjelica Huston); Eleanors other ex- and fellow oceanographer Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum); Steves trusted mate Klaus Daimler (Willem Dafoe); and Steves shady producer Oseary Drakoulias (Michael Gambon). In addition Steve encounters air pilot Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) who convinces Steve that hes his long-lost son. Pic is no more interested in real oceanography than Steve is and true to Andersons interest in eccentric families uses the life aquatic as mere background for a poorly conceived comedy about a father and a son trying to know each other and the woman who gets in the way. That would be oceanography reporter Jane Winslett-Richardson (Cate Blanchett) whos determined to get the real stuff on Steve for her magazine. Jane insinuates herself into Steves life and he alternates between giving her prickly interviews and trying to seduce her -- while she and Ned heat it up in her cabin. During one of his trysts with Jane Ned abandons his watch on deck and doesnt see Filipino pirates board the ship and kidnap meek bond company rep Bill (Bud Cort) who speaks Tagalog. Not only does Steve pull off a ridiculously-staged one-man Dirty Harry attack on the fleeing pirates but this bit gets extended into a mission to rescue Bill from a deserted resort island. Pic falls between the put-on and the real -- whether its the characters various relationships the film-within-the-film (which looks too suspiciously directed with Andersons distinctive eye) or the scientific parts. Latter comes closest to a full cartoon care of the handmade work of animator Henry Selick whose usually candy-colored imaginary creatures hint at the wonderful fully post-modern movie this could have been. Murray who has worked deliciously with Anderson before in ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" seeks but never finds a way to make playing tired not appear tired. Cast appears to take its cue from Murray slowing down to the point of stasis. Wilson Huston Dafoe and Gambon do not come close to the comic levels of which they are capable. Where Wilson is actually most missed however is as Andersons usual co-screenwriter -- that task is taken over this time by Noah Baumbach. Blanchett unlike her uninspired cast mates deploys a darling upper-crust Brit accent some verve and a comely manner that could intrigue the most apathetic male. Right in his typecast groove Goldblum swims through his small role as a man of leisure. Insiders may chuckle at film biz jokes galore starting with character names but this also shows how the comedy as a whole operates in a vacuum. Production designer Mark Friedbergs attempts at showing the real and the fake are hit-and-miss while the generally aimless eccentricity infects the music that includes composer Mark Mothersbaughs Casio-type sounds classical cues and Jorges Bowie settings. Andersons regular lenser Robert Yeoman delivers his usual pristine widescreen images. For a studio pic sound is shockingly poor.

It is not these days the good-life aquatic Bill Murray plays an oceanographer whos trying to keep his career afloat. Buena Vista Pictures While David O. Russells I Heart Huckabees may have felt like an Anderson comedy gone terribly wrong Andersons The Life Aquatic goes plenty haywire enough all by itself. Its sporadic droll moments tempt one to view it with a charitable eye until patience is exhausted by the end. Murray is the titles Zissou an oceanographer whose last nine documentaries have glugged which can dry up funding. And something called a jaguar shark has just devoured his longtime associate (Seymour Cassel) which gives him the brainstorm to make pursuit of the creature his next filmed project. If were never going to see Murray play Captain Ahab -- something Id pay to see -- this sounds like OK compensation. But Aquatic gets bogged down in extended-family dysfunction thats not as funny as Andersons The Royal Tenenbaums but has the same tendency toward the precious. About the movie The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou   (out of four) Stars Bill Murray Owen Wilson Cate Blanchett Anjelica Huston Jeff Goldblum Willem Dafoe Michael Gambon Directors Wes Anderson Distributor Touchstone Rated R for language some drug use violence and partial nudity Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles; wide Dec. 25 This time ""family"" doesnt particularly allude to a blood line. This is true even if Zissou does have recruited for the ride Anjelica Huston as a purse-string-pulling wife and Owen Wilson as someone who may or may not be a long-lost son. Other shipmates include Willem Dafoe as a ""Klaus"" who keeps getting his feelings hurt; Cate Blanchett as a single and pregnant journalist; and Bud Cort as a corporate money protector who inspires the kind of line Murray really knows how to read ""Ive never seen a bond company stooge stick his neck out like that."" Its hard to get a bead on just what kind of guy Zissou is. A few homophobic remarks (one or two directed at Hustons first husband played by Jeff Goldblum) suggest he might have some kind of problem. Otherwise the movie is all over the place. It has an almost slapstick pirate attack a belated attempt at poignancy that just doesnt come off and of course the prerequisite volume of Murrays sometimes funny deadpanned zingers. These might elicit more positive response if Lost in Translation wasnt such a recent and far superior cross-reference. In keeping with the oceanic theme the movie is easy on the eye. Its aqua-heavy in costuming and overall color scheming and even the Post-it notes are Easter-egg blue. What looks like a potentially attractive package follows in the dispiriting footsteps of not just Huckabees but also Napoleon Dynamite. It looks as if it is now possible to get a movie bankrolled -- even with major casts -- that is nothing but attitude.

"A really fine kettle of fish - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW A really fine kettle of fishDecember 10 2004|Carina Chocano | Times Staff Writer On the face of it Wes Andersons new movie ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" is an adventure tale about a Jacques Cousteau-on-the-skids-type who decides to pull an Ahab on the shark that ate his buddy. But mostly like all Wes Anderson movies its about being 11 1/2 -- its a recurring motif anyway -- sometime around the late 70s an age-era axis favored by Anderson and at least partly attributable to his current age of 35.But Anderson doesnt make nostalgic movies exactly. He makes movies about the way nostalgia works on people -- which is different. All of his characters have longed for something weirdly ineffable like the present or the adult lives they imagined as kids. Oceanographer documentarian and hubristic tragic hero Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) longs for all of the above -- plus a legacy; a son-figure; the reporter (Cate Blanchett) who has come to write a profile on him; a puff piece to get his career back on track; some money; a little consideration; a little understanding and revenge.An exquisitely evocative movie that elevates rueful melancholia to a superpower ""The Life Aquatic"" co-written with Noah Baumbach is not exactly a plot-lovers pizza. Anderson is all about the resonant image an anachronistic tic he cops to up front. Before the first character is introduced the camera lingers in wide-angle on a large Renaissance tableau serving as a backdrop for a stage. Its a familiar shorthand Frame the vantage point maybe hang drapes in the periphery and wait for someone to meander into the frame. What were about to see is not reality but an artistic interpretation of it -- no more a ""slice of life"" than a slice of pie.""The Life Aquatic"" does that thing movies used to think they were supposed to do paint with light sculpt in time drive you nuts with longing for something hard to pinpoint that you probably never had deliver an emotional experience from which you wont recover. In ""The Life Aquatic"" this is achieved through an ineffable alchemy of red wool caps pale blue Speedos ""Zissou"" Adidas acoustic David Bowie songs sung in Portuguese by a Brazilian crew member named Pele (namesake of the worlds greatest soccer player) the welling (twice) of Bill Murrays tears and Tintin tableaux of the entire ragtag crew -- including a turban-wearing cameraman named Vikram -- crammed into a yellow deep-sea exploration vessel.No doubt this endorsement isnt inspiring fans of Spielberg to leap off the couch and get on the horn with MovieFone -- although Murray does single-handedly take on a band of Philippine pirates in a scene thats a surreal version of somebodys dream about ""Apocalypse Now."" But this shark movie which alludes to the other shark movie which along with ""Star Wars"" is responsible for blockbustering into oblivion the best decade American movies ever saw has something to say about that too. Not for nothing is the dead guy played by 70s icon Seymour Cassel while Bud Cort of ""Harold and Maude"" fame is bound and gagged by pirates.On the other hand if youve already glued a statuette of Bill Murray patron saint of inchoate yearning and exquisite disappointment to your dashboard nothing about ""The Life Aquatic"" will disappoint. Because talk about man against the universe.We meet Steve Zissou at the premiere of his latest deep-sea documentary barely enduring the Q amp; A. As much as its possible for an oceanographers life to do so his has gone off the rails. His last five films have tanked. His marriage to Eleanor (Anjelica Huston) who is widely rumored to be ""the real brains behind Team Zissou"" is on the rocks. His producer Drakoulias (Michael Gambon) is having trouble putting together financing for his next venture. His smarmy ""nemesis"" Alistair Hennessey (Jeff Goldblum) erstwhile roommate and ex-husband of Eleanor is hogging all the grant money. And during the filming of ""Secret of the Leopard Shark Part I"" his best friend and partner Esteban (Cassel) was eaten by the films elusive subject.So for his next film he tells the audience hed like to hunt down the shark and kill it.""What would be the scientific purpose of killing it?"" a woman asks.""Revenge.""But the leopard shark turns out to be a spotted McGuffin. The real story -- or as Steve sells it to Vikram ""the relationship subplot"" -- begins when Steve is approached by young Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson) a diffident pilot for Air Kentucky whom Steve quickly introduces as ""probably my son."" Ned is the second reminder in about as many minutes of Steves many betrayals of Eleanor but as far as Steves concerned his timing couldnt be better. As he tells Eleanor later after his hubris and megalomania has caused the expedition to all but end in disaster ""I believe in the boy.""""Why?""""Because he looks up to me.""1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAs Grand Budapest Hotel opens a look at Wes Andersons...March 7 2014An ideal dive partnerMay 10 2005Hes the other Steve ZissouJanuary 3 2005This strand runs deepNovember 14 2004Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2004/dec/10/entertainment/et-aquatic10,200,thelifeaquaticwithstevezissou30,thelifeaquaticwithstevezissou,latimes

Anderson who captured the loyalty of a similarly disposed demographic with his 1996 debut crime caper Bottle Rocket came of artistic age with a bunch of other youngish filmmakers -- Spike Jonze Charlie Kaufman David O. Russell Alexander Payne and Sofia Coppola prominent among them -- whose movies seem to fly unmediated from their vaguely depressive compulsively associative heads onto the screen. If their adamant refusal of linear narrative psychological coherence and cinematic violence suggests a loose generational sensibility the loony idiosyncrasy with which they stare into their own neurosis and outward into a confounding world refutes all labeling. Collectively they are the freshest thing to hit American cinema in decades but individually their brand of crackpot subjectivity always teeters on the brink of impenetrability. The level of public bafflement and critical dissent over movies like Lost in Translation Adaptation and most recently I  Huckabees (all films I loved) suggests that sometimes its possible to dwell so far inside your own innovative mind that your brains fall out. Such is the case with Wes Andersons new film The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou an overstuffed creature with its head stuck so far up its ass that it left me scratching my own er head. Co-written with his friend Noah Baumbach who made the lively Kicking and Screaming and is currently adapting Roald Dahls Fantastic Mr. Fox with Anderson The Life Aquatic draws its inspiration from the directors long-standing obsession with the cult of French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau a notoriously swollen ego given to feuding with friends colleagues and family alike. In the movie Bill Murray plays Steve Zissou a washed-up oceanographer propelled by equally bloated proportions of self-regard and self-loathing who pulls together a crew of quarrelsome kooks on a boat to make an epic documentary that will chronicle his efforts to settle scores with a jaguar shark (whatever that is) that ate his longtime partner while upstaging a prosperous rival (Jeff Goldblum). When a gentlemanly young Kentucky pilot named Ned Plimpton played by Andersons longtime collaborator Owen Wilson shows up out of the blue claiming to be Steves long-lost illegitimate son Steve sees an opportunity to become the father he has always meant to be. Feuding families swelling paternal egos and oedipal messes run a thick fault line through Andersons work; he carries a cadre of actors with him from one film to the next remodeling them in variations on their earlier roles. In Rushmore Murray played a tycoon trying to redeem poor parenting of his own sons by befriending schoolboy Jason Schwartzman then competing with him for the affections of a pretty young teacher. And in The Royal Tenenbaums while Murray settled for playing husband/father-figure to Gwyneth Paltrow Gene Hackman took up the torch as the hopelessly incompetent patriarch of that family of angry and depressed geniuses. For all their meandering plot lines both those wonderfully weird movies managed to cohere around a recognizable structure and a cast small enough not to overwhelm Andersons underlying themes.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm The Life Aquatic is a potentially great little cult picture shrieking in protest at being bumped up into a 50 million studio movie whose only real pleasure is its happy-color production design. A huge ensemble with little to do but act wacky doesnt help Willem Dafoe as Steves insecure engineer; Anjelica Huston in a variation of her maternal role in Tenenbaums as his brilliant wife; Cate Blanchett in a painfully fake British accent as a pregnant journalist (once again Murray competes for her favors with a son bona fide or otherwise); Bud Cort looking downright ancient as the bond-company stooge who ends up rooting for Steve; and Seu Jorge as a safety expert given to singing David Bowie songs in Portuguese which I suppose must have seemed funny on the drawing board. Crudely rendered fake fish created by the talented animator Henry Selick (James and the Giant Peach) float pointlessly in the background. There are even lurches into action sequences which the director cant seem to control. (Anderson ruefully but accurately told The New York Times that in six-camera shots ""Youre supposed to have six cameras going and I dont know what to do with the other five."") In his other films it was a delight to tarry over Andersons fanciful yet truthful detail. In The Life Aquatic you have to fight your way through his digressive mess to find the story. Somewhere buried beneath all this ballast something is being said again about flawed middle-aged men falling from grace and redeeming themselves. This time Im damned if I know what that something is and I hope that next time around Anderson will return to his greatest creative asset -- a small budget.In the early phase of his career Steven Soderbergh might well have been dubbed the father of the Wes Anderson Spike Jonze et al. school of creative obfuscation. Ive no doubt that Soderbergh can and will again make inscrutably brainy pieces of varying distinction like Schizopolis Kafka and The Underneath. For now though hes the nearest thing we have to a gentleman director and I mean that as an ardent compliment. For sheer urbane elegance coupled with technical mastery and lush old-fashioned elan no one working for the studios today comes close to the versatile Soderbergh who has shown himself as fluent in the language of old-Hollywood romance (Out of Sight) as in the grainy nether regions of the international drug trade (Traffic) or the L.A. crime world (The Limey) or in the plebeian energies of populist agitprop (Erin Brockovich). In his remake of the Rat Pack crime caper Oceans Eleven Soderbergh seemed to reach a stylistic peak. And though its not unusual for him to take a break between big pictures and yield to a personal indulgence this time around hes clearly sticking with what works. If anything Oceans Twelve tops the suave formal daring of its predecessor and Ive no doubt that even in the crush of holiday movies it will work a similar box-office miracle. When last we saw Daniel Ocean (George Clooney) and his ragged crew of petty-crime experts they had penetrated the inaccessible vault of the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas and parted fastidious casino boss Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) from 160 million of his fortune not to mention his girlfriend Tess (Julia Roberts). Now they languish in miserable legitimacy from which in a puckish and very funny reversal of the opening scenes of Oceans Eleven theyre sprung when Benedict dispatches his thugs to round them up and demand they give him back his money. Following a series of increasingly impossible heists around Europe Daniel and his merry band find themselves pitted not only against high-tech security gizmos and the cops spearheaded by art-crime specialist Catherine Zeta-Jones but against the Continents premier playboy and thief the Night Fox (Vincent Cassel) who never saw a Faberge egg he didnt like.Oceans Twelves many twists and turns are intricately fitted together and accessorized with nifty flashback and delirious pauses for nutty banter. The movie which has a crisply witty screenplay by George Nolfi pulls so many fast ones on both its characters and its audience that I can tell you little more about the story that wouldnt ruin it for you. Suffice it to say that the movie starts off flitting between several American states and ends up racing between several trendy European capitals that Roberts gets to impersonate a famous movie star that other Soderbergh pals show up for gallant cameos that Cherry Jones does something surprising for Matt Damons hilariously overambitious pickpocket and that Zeta-Jones gorgeous (despite a duck-bill hairdo) in black leather and red silks discovers that the line between crime and crimefighting is finer than shed thought. The heist scenes are as terrific as they are hilariously abortive. Oceans Twelve may be one of the most glamorous goofy and heartfelt films about failure ever made and as soon as I get out from under Oscar-qualifying weepies about incest child-molesting and paralysis Im going to run out and see it again just to cheer myself up.THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU | Directed by WES ANDERSON | Written by ANDERSON and NOAH BAUMBACH Produced by ANDERSON BARRY MENDEL and SCOTT RUDIN Released by Touchstone Pictures | At the GroveOCEANS TWELVE | Directed by STEVEN SODERBERGH | Written by GEORGE NOLFI | Produced by JERRY WEINTRAUB | Released by Warner Bros.
