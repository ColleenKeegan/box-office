Starring Val Kilmer Ryan Phillipe Kristen Wiig Will Forte Director Jorma Taccone Release Opened May 21 2010  Editorial Review MacGruber defuse this bomb at willBy Ruth McCannFriday May 21 2010Is dressing up a corpse funny? Is 80s music funny? Is blowing up your best friends funny? It depends really on whos involved. You need a great character to make a bad thing good and the action comedy ""MacGruber"" is sadly short on great characters. For all the wacky taboo parodic situations that ""MacGruber"" plunges into the film seems content to simply point at its hero yell ""What a schmuck"" and leave it at that.In the sometimes-grand tradition of ""Saturday Night Live"" skits that morph into movies ""SNL"" cast member Will Forte brings his crime-fighting character MacGruber to the silver screen and takes full advantage of an R rating with potty jokes and grisly throat-slitting (our heros preferred method of dispatch). The cast many of them ""SNL"" regulars ham it up with verve but its the writing (by Forte and other ""SNL""-ers) that brings things down. Theres little evidence here of the fully imagined characters and silly turns of phrase that made say ""Waynes World"" so inspired.In the ""SNL"" skits MacGruber (parodying TV hero MacGyver) established himself as a hapless guy who attempts to use everyday items to defuse bombs. But he invariably gets sidetracked and forgets to jerry-rig a life-saving device. Tick tick boom the bomb explodes but obviously MacGruber lives to die another day. (Oddly this gimmick isnt used in the film.)At the start of ""MacGruber"" we find our hero hiding out in a monastery-type place where he fled after the villainous Dieter blew up MacGrubers wife on their wedding day. MacGruber survived the blast but allowed the world to believe hed perished. Now years later Dieter is in possession of a nuclear warhead and the Pentagon wants MacGruber to go after him. Hungry for revenge he agrees.After MacGruber accidentally blows up his crack team of men hes dismissed from the case but he pleads with a Pentagon newbie Lt. Dixon Piper (Ryan Phillippe) to reinstate him. Piper agrees and the two join up with MacGrubers old associate Vicki St. Elmo (Kristen Wiig) in a bumbling chase after Dieter the warhead sweet vengeance love and sex in a graveyard.Directed by ""SNLs"" Jorma Taccone ""MacGruber"" sets out to parody not only the bad 80s hair and super-suaveness of ""MacGyver"" but also the absurd machismo and melodrama of action flicks at large. The deeply inept MacGruber acquires just enough of a persona to cobble together a feature-length story but not enough to really make an impression.The whole package for all its energy is often lamentably unsubtle. Like a kid banging pots together in a kitchen its a little bit funny until its not.Contains strong crude and sexual content violence language and some nudity Want to go? 0 Been there? 0 Rate it 0 Share Recently Reviewed Creative Control Eye in the Sky Hello My Name Is Doris KTown Cowboys Miracles from Heaven Remember The Bronze The Confirmation The Divergent Series Allegiant The Divergent Series Allegiant The IMAX Experience Embrace of The Serpent (El abrazo de la serpiente) Knight of Cups Top MacGruber Find x Showtimes x Current Location Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by Email Share on Pinterest Share on Google Plus Share on Tumblr Add to Go Out List Print 0 0 Going Out Guide Home Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Movies Trailers In Theaters Coming Soon Critics Picks Top Box Office Events Music Museums Theater amp; Dance Visitors Guide Follow Us Homepage | Sign in | Talk to Us | Newsletters Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Post x Share on Facebook Share your Want to go and Been there lists with Facebook friends.

"MacGruber | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; macgruber ) MacGruber (United States 2010) May 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Saturday Night Live movies generally come in two categories inspired comedies and woefully inept borderline-unwatchable dreck. Unsurprisingly considering the difficulty (not to mention the wisdom) of transforming a five-minute sketch into a 90-minute motion picture the members of the latter group greatly outnumber those of the former. And while it would be unfair to saddle MacGruber with the ""worst SNL movie of all-time"" moniker (I can think of at least two that are more painful to endure) its place on the vaunted 2010 Worst 10 list is assured. MacGruber a parody of the 80s TV series MacGyver never aspired to anything more grand than a one-laugh joke during its limited SNL days (with the highlight being a guest appearance by Richard Dean Anderson) and its transition to the big screen left that one laugh behind. Watching this movie I wished I knew how to use dental floss a paper clip and a crumpled movie ticket to break the projector. The biggest fault attributable to MacGruber is that the writers (SNL scribes Will Forte John Solomon Jorma Taccone) mistake profanity for humor. Tossing around f-bombs like punctuation marks does not transform pedestrian dialogue into guffaw-laden material. Its as if freed from the constraints of NBC the filmmakers elected to use all the blue language they cant get past the TV censors. And while rude raunchy coarse comedy can at times be very funny (recent examples include 2009s The Hangover and 2010s Get Him to the Greek) merely peppering a screenplay with four-letter words guarantees nothing except an R-rating and a red band trailer. In the case of MacGruber it highlights the paucity of humor on display. I chuckled three times but didnt come close to a full-bellied laugh. Sitting through MacGruber is like watching a bad SNL sketch that never ends. You keep praying for the commercial break. MacGruber establishes the title character (reprised by Will Forte) as a retired special ops legend who has been in hiding since being declared dead. Now his old boss Colonel James Faith (Powers Boothe in the Richard Crenna role) wants MacGruber to come back to life for one last mission. The mercenary Dieter Von Cunth (Val Kilmer) has stolen a nuclear missile and the only thing preventing him from using it is that he doesnt possess the safety codes. Faith believes MacGruber can keep those passwords from falling into the wrong hands. Also MacGruber and Cunth have a past - once the best of friends they were divided by a woman. Assembling a team that includes Lt. Dixon Piper (Ryan Philippe)a straitlaced officer under Faiths command and the reliable Vicki St. Elmo (Kristin Wiig) MacGruber sets out to complete the task and save the civilized world. Want an example of what passes for high comedy in MacGruber? Take the villains name ""Cunth."" Say it aloud and assume the final ""h"" is silent. (When doing so you might want to make sure youre alone.) Thats right Val Kilmer is playing a Cunt(h). Are you rolling on the floor laughing? I can imagine Beavis and Butthead snickering in the corner ""He said cunt."" Although the most obvious flaw with MacGruber is the disappointingly low laugh quotient thats not the sole problem. As is the case with many poor action/comedies this one spends too much time on exposition for a plot that no one in the audience cares about. Its boring and tedious but incorporating this extraneous material is how the five-minute skit becomes bloated to elephantine proportions. There are nods to the source material (a couple of halfhearted jabs at MacGyver and Wiig doing her countdown) but the movie seems largely unconcerned about its origins. MacGruber came into being because MacGyvers penchant for invention was ripe to be lampooned; its unclear how anyone thought this could be successfully expanded. MacGruber does little thats interesting daring or surprising - qualities demanded by most good comedy. The target audience would appear to be nine year old boys who find the frequent repetition of profanity to be hilarious in and of its own right. The gags featuring a naked Forte with a stick of celery up his butt pale in comparison to the more envelope-pushing material from Borat. The comedic aspects of the sex scenes wilt when compared to the Jeff Goldblum/Emma Thompson coupling in The Tall Guy. Waynes World and The Blues Brothers worked in large part because they played by a ""no rules"" approach. MacGruber is constrained by conventionality. Take away the stick of celery and the f-bombs and this would be a harmless and boring PG-13 direct-to-video offering. More often than not the attachment of Lorne Michaels name to a motion picture is a warning to move to the next auditorium at the multiplex even if its showing something in 3-D and you dont have the glasses. The average SNL episode is too uneven to watch all the way through making the fast-forward button a mandatory tool. The irony is that if employed for MacGruber it would shrink a 90-minute motion picture into a five-minute blur.

"MacGruber was funny on SNL but falls short on the big screen. Slate Sign In Sign Up MacGruber was funny on SNL but falls short on the big screen. MacGruber was funny on SNL but falls short on the big screen. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 21 2010 309 PM MacGruber Yet another SNL-inspired script flops on the big screen. By Dana Stevens MacGruber My Slate colleague Jonah Weiner published an article in the New York Times Arts amp; Leisure section last weekend on MacGruber (Universal Pictures) an action comedy based on the ongoing Saturday Night Live skit of that name in which the creators speak with sincerity and passion of their desire to break the SNL-inspired movie formula--to do something really different. ""The first thing we thought was the first thing everyone must think How can we possibly pull this off?"" asks Jorma Taccone the films director and an SNL writer who originated the MacGruber character. John Solomon another SNL writer who co-wrote the movie with Taccone and its star Will Forte adds ""I think this movie is going to surprise a lot of people."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Having now seen MacGruber I find these comments both funnier and more touching than anything that happens in the movie. In fact the MacGruber teams firm belief that their movie is going to be awesome recalls nothing so much as the unshakable and completely unfounded self-confidence of MacGruber himself. The character as embodied on big screen and small by Forte is a blustering but incompetent action hero whose supposed expertise in bomb defusing inevitably ends in a giant (stock footage) fireball. Like Wile E. Coyote hes blown up in every episode only to reappear in the next with his self-esteem undented. Its a concept that appeals by virtue of its slightness and absurdity. The likelihood of this one-joke goof surviving the jump to feature-film format is as slim as the chance of MacGruber successfully disabling a bomb. The late-night sketch version of MacGruber lives in a blissfully context-free universe We dont need to know who set the bomb and why only that the timer is ticking. But in a full-length feature MacGruber needs a back story an antagonist a romantic interest--all of which are supplied laboriously in the movies opening act. The back story After serving his nation in countless wars and espionage operations MacGruber has withdrawn to a monastery in Ecuador determined to live as a man of peace. The antagonist Dieter von Cunth (Val Kilmer) a rogue evildoer whos come into possession of a black-market Russian missile and is ready to aim it at Washington D.C. The romantic interest Vicki St. Elmo (Kristen Wiig) an old friend of MacGrubers whos been pining for him since she witnessed his bride-to-be (Maya Rudolph) get blown up at their wedding. MacGrubers former boss Colonel Faith (Powers Boothe) coaxes him to abandon monastic life put together a team and ""pound some Cunth""--a joke that youll get plenty of opportunities to hear again if you miss it the first time. Advertisement MacGruber assembles a band of brawny thugs with names such as Vernon Freedom Tug Phelps and Tanker Lutz (many of them played in cameos by star wrestlers). But in one of the movies better sick jokes the entire team is blown to bits when MacGruber does a poor job of packing explosives in the trunk of their van. After begging the general to keep him on the mission hes forced to proceed with a reduced cohort just himself the reluctant Vicki and lantern-jawed straight man Lt. Dixon Piper (Ryan Philippe). MacGruber has no plan per se--hes ""not a plan guy""--but he just knows that if they can find Cunth and ... get him somehow everything will turn out OK. Taccone takes full advantage of the films R rating cramming in maximal quantities of raunchy absurdity. Some of the sillier gags are so out-there that they actually work like when MacGruber has sex with his dead wifes ghost against her gravestone or parades naked in front of armed guards with a stalk of celery up his butt ""to distract them."" But the script isnt dense enough with jokes good or bad to get the viewer through the longueurs of the plot. The action climax which involves a high body count a lot of realistic-looking gore and at least one desecrated corpse takes the cheerful black humor thats MacGrubers stock in trade to a queasily uncomfortable place. The funniest moments in Magruber arent exactly jokes but stylistic nods to the 80s action genre that this movie intermittently spoofs. Though the story takes place in the present day both MacGruber and Vicki appear to exist in a perpetual Reagan era where mullets puffy vests blue eye shadow and Totos ""Rosanna"" constitute the cutting edge of cool. A sex scene in which the hero and heroine make tasteful backlit love to the strains of Mr. Misters ""Broken Wings"" ends abruptly with an unromantic soundtrack-free shot of MacGruber straining and grunting away. If you dont go in expecting a Tropic Thunder level of joke density you may be fine with MacGrubers one-decent-laugh-per-scene ratio. But theres a conceptual flaw at this movies heart By the very nature of the sketch MacGruber cant succeed on the big screen. The SNL skits get laughs from combining the grandiose scope of an action movie with the cramped bare-bones stage of a live late-night comedy show. Its funny because it looks dinky cheap and fake. By showing real buildings really exploding and real throats--or a believable simulacrum thereof--ripped open by real bare hands MacGruber commits the deeply MacGruber-esque mistake of shooting itself in the foot.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Spoofs these days often bear only a passing resemblance to the genres and films theyre spoofing. To cite a particularly egregious example Epic Movie took on as parody fodder such exemplars of ambitious expansive big-scale filmmaking as Nacho Libre and Borat. Jorma Taccone and Will Fortes MacGruber errs in the opposite direction. Its so obsessed with getting the hair clothes beats cliches music and conventions of cheesy 80s action movies in the Cannon vein right that it sometimes forgets to include jokes. The first Saturday Night Live-derived film in more than a decade casts co-screenwriter Will Forte as the title character a jeans-wearing mullet-sporting 80s throwback/MacGyver parody with the cockiness of an action hero and the problem-solving skills of a bumbling comic sidekick. The film opens with mentor Powers Boothe luring Forte out of retirement to track down arch-nemesis Val Kilmer a sinister tycoon named Dieter Van Cunth who killed Fortes wife on their wedding day. MacGrubers commitment to replicating the look and feel of its satirical subject extends to having supporting players like Boothe (essentially playing Richard Crennas paternalistic mentor from the Rambo films) and Ryan Phillippe (as Fortes by-the-book sidekick) deliver the same performances they would in a straightforward action movie. MacGrubers stone-faced approach to parody makes everyone Fortes straight man; hes an oasis of silliness in a sea of action-movie tropes played straight. Yet its the random silliness that scores whether its Fortes singular manner of distracting adversaries his obsession with the license number of a driver who antagonized him or his offer of sex as a first and last resort. MacGruber alternates quick bursts of laugh-out-loud funniness with long dry stretches. It isnt exactly good but for audiences in search of nothing more than a few silly chuckles it should prove good enough. If nothing else MacGruber proves yet again that its always wise to be wary of films whose supporting characters have crude double entendres for names a principle that perhaps should be known as the Tugginmypudha Rule after Ben Kingsleys ""humorously"" named mystic in The Love Guru.

Comments MacGruber Video Rated R  90 minutes  2010 Constructing a feature-length comedy around a Saturday Night Live character has always been a fools errand but luckily for Will Forte his demented special-ops warrior MacGruber (conceived as a parody of the ultra-resourceful TV hero MacGyver) slots neatly into the formula of the fireball-laden summer action flick. As a result this keeps chugging along even when the vainglorious and profoundly incompetent MacGruber begins to remind you of one too many Will Ferrell characters. The genre-spoof elements are pretty stale (slow-motion shots of the characters crying out in rage or strutting toward the camera with an explosion behind them) but the movie scores a few laughs with its startling use of bloody R-rated violence and there are enjoyable turns by Kristen Wiig (as MacGrubers sidekick) Val Kilmer (as the international bad guy) and Powers Boothe (as the good guys commanding officer). Jorman Taccone directed; with Ryan Philippe and Maya Rudolph. By J.R.

"Movie review MacGruber - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MovieMovie review MacGruberSNLs Will Forte cobbles together a comedy from duct tape and a celery stalk and its not half bad.May 22 2010|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Whipping up a movie based on a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch isnt inherently a bad idea; it just seems that way based on a track record thats well sketchy. Theres ""Waynes World"" and then theres a lot of ""A Night at the Roxburys."" What probably appealed to the makers of ""MacGruber"" a co-writer/star Will Forte and his writing collaborators John Solomon and Jorma Taccone who also directed a was the idea that their mullet-sporting special ops goofball almost cried out for the multiplex-sized mayhem treatment. Hes an action star parody after all and while this jury-rigged exercise may not be an explosion of laughs its no dud either. The original ""SNL"" bits were tips of the hat to the 80s television mainstay ""MacGyver"" in which Richard Dean Andersons crafty agent preferred the resourcefulness of paper clips and duct tape to guns when escaping certain death. Fortes sketches memorably added a maelstrom of focus-sapping personal issues so as to comically defuse the steely resolve of an ingenious hero. The MacGruber for the movies however retreats to a more standard adventure-spoof archetype the delusional total idiot. Drawn out of hiding by a Pentagon colonel (Powers Boothe) to stop a missile-armed archnemesis with a family newspaper-unfriendly name ( Val Kilmer) MacGruber is a good guy swimming in bad traits by turns petulant cowardly egotistical childish jealous homophobic clueless sadistic and desperate. (His default begging tactic is one of the films funnier R-rated gags.) Hes got a feather-haired gal with a crush on him (""SNL"" regular Kristen Wiig committed if underused) yet hes not above indulging in hilariously grunty cemetery sex with the ghost of his dead wife (Maya Rudolph). Hes also quick to use Ryan Phillippes Lt. Piper as a human shield. (A metaphor of sorts for Phillippes straight man amid the silliness.) Perhaps the only thing heroically sweet about him is his sporty Miata and the 80s rock-pop playlist emanating from his removable car stereo what he might just love most in the world. With a role like this creating an anything-goes vibe is half the battle. And Forte a a worthy post- Will Ferrell clown in both deadpan or outburst modes a handily establishes his gonzo comedy cred especially when it comes to a useful celery stalk. Strategically if unsanitarily employed it does the job of distracting MacGrubers targets. The same could be said for the agreeably diverting movie that shares his name. calendarlatimes.com Clicking on Green Links will take you to a third-party e-commerce site.

By Ty Burr Globe Staff / May 21 2010 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + All thing considered ""MacGruber is a lot better than it should be. That still doesnt mean its all that great.Based on a ""Saturday Night Live skit that was funny precisely twice (which in itself is about twice as funny as most ""SNL skits these days) the movie stars Will Forte one of Lorne Michaels antic vaguely anonymous late-night comedy stars. (Is it just me or is Forte virtually interchangeable with Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis?)The original skits were a genial goof on the high-80s TV series ""McGyver with Fortes resourceful dumb action hero trapped in a warehouse and failing to disarm a nuclear warhead time after time -- the man had more lives than Kenny on ""South Park. The movie saves that scene until the very end delivering a long run-up thats mostly a James Bond-style action pastiche with a touch of Rambo-itis. Imagine Austin Powers with a mullet and youre getting close.Actually some of the movies most reliable comedy comes from its straight men specifically Powers Boothe as the Pentagon colonel who brings MacGruber out of Ecuadorean exile to deal with a grave threat to national security and Val Kilmer as that threat. The ubervillains name is Dieter Von Cunth which the script has much merry fun with before moving on to less sophisticated gags.Von Cunth has his hands on a rogue warhead and wants to use it on Washington; MacGruber has his own score to settle having lost his wife (a ghostly Maya Rudolph) to his enemys bomb on their wedding day. The movies one long joke is that the hero is a delusional twit -- wait isnt that the plot of every Will Ferrell movie? -- but the crass dialog is given some decent top-spin by Fortes straight-faced timing.Theres only so much he can do though. A bit where a desperate MacGruber offers to sexually service another character gets a shock-laugh once but not the second time. Same with a sight-gag involving a stick of celery sticking out of someones buttocks. But since when has an ""SNL project been above beating a dirty joke into the ground?MacGrubers team (after a first crew all played by WWE wrestlers has met a preposterously amusing end) is made up of the capable young Lieutenant Dixon Piper (Ryan Phillippe) and Vicki St. Elmo (Fortes ""SNL cast-mate Kristen Wiig). Phillippe is called on to be heroic and wooden and he suffices; Wiig has her best moment when the tremulously naive Vicki is asked to impersonate MacGruber at a coffee shop.Theres also some flickering wit in the way the movie injects Reagan-era pop cheese wherever it can a snippet of Totos ""Rosanna on the soundtrack the Blaupunkt cassette deck the hero carries with him everywhere. MacGruber arriving at a party in a white suit that screams John Oates circa 1985 may be an easy laugh but a laugh it is.The never-ending weenie jokes by contrast are easy without being particularly funny and the smugness that has infected so much ""SNL product of oh the last 25 years -- of reasonably talented comics knowing that if theyre naughty enough they wont have to work too hard to be hilarious -- eventually overtakes ""MacGruber too.Until then I guess we should be thankful the movie hits about half its intended marks a fairly high average for one of these spinoffs. Believe the hype ""MacGruber actually is the best ""SNL movie since ""Waynes World -- but only because the alternatives are ""Its Pat ""A Night at the Roxbury and ""The Ladies Man.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

You cant touch that stupid network TV censors The result is a naughty throwaway in all senses of the word throwaway-90 minutes of talented performers doing and saying dumb crude stuff in pursuit of an elusive laugh in a disposable action-comedy primarily geared to young men and the 11-year-old boys who will want to sneak into the R-rated screening. Lured out of retirement by his former commanding officer (Powers Boothe from Sin City) to bring down an evil arms dealer (Val Kilmer) Fortes MacGruber a decorated Green Beret Navy SEAL and Army Ranger recruits two other associates (Ryan Phillippe and SNLs Kristen Wiig) to help him with wildly uneven results. Even when the evil arms dealer eludes them they enjoy saying his name Dieter Von Cunth especially because the h is all but silent. (You cant touch that either NBC suits) Wiig draws on her special skills at playing women who are somewhere between plucky and damaged; Phillippe is a nice comedy surprise as straight man among the buffoons. Well aware that sometimes all a moviegoer wants is to be entertained by the sight of a guy proudly displaying a stalk of celery inserted between his naked butt cheeks I still hope and dream that such a moviegoer wants more than MacGruber.

How much mileage can a comedy get from a single joke? Quite a bit judging from the guffaws-to-groaners ratio in ""MacGruber"" a raunchy broadly played farce that may amuse -- and almost certainly will surprise -- even non-fans of the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches that inspired it. With Will Forte in top form as a mullet-maned lost-in-the-80s action hero and scads of R-rated dialogue bound to be quoted around water coolers and frat houses pic should generate sufficiently enthusiastic word of mouth to be a more potent B.O. performer than most other recent ""SNL"" spin-offs. Homevid biz could be huge. Fortunately for all parties involved scriptwriters Forte John Solomon and Jorma Taccone (making his feature helming debut) recognized the limitations of their source material an ongoing series of ""SNL"" sketches that spoof -- with at best mixed results -- ""MacGyver"" the 1985-92 TV actioner that toplined Richard Dean Anderson as an unarmed adventure hero who used brainpower rather than firepower. The ""MacGruber"" sketches never last more than a minute and always end with a fiery (but miraculously non-lethal) explosion. The ""MacGruber"" movie lasts 90 minutes -- arguably 20 minutes more than absolutely necessary -- but manages to be much wittier while aiming at more varied targets. Taccone -- part of the Lonely Island troupe that has produced some instant-classic ""Digital Shorts"" for ""SNL"" -- has joined forces with his co-scripters to affectionately parody not just a single Reagan-era TV series but an entire genre of over-the-top blood-and-thunder 80s action pics. With all the gleeful abandon of Ritalin-deficient channel-surfers they fast-forward through everything from obvious A-list titles (Sylvester Stallones ""Rambo"" sagas the ""Lethal Weapon"" series) to made-for-video knockoffs strip-mining the fertile ground for familiar cliches and conventions -- wiseacre heroes testosterone-fueled mayhem belligerently snarky dialogue bad hairdos etc. -- that truth be told were hard to take very seriously in the first place. As MacGruber a free-wheeling trash-talking braggart whose arrogant self-assurance is only occasionally justified Forte cannily distills the essence of Stallone Mel Gibson and a dozen or so other 80s icons while coming across as a sometimes doltish sometimes deadly live-action cartoon whos obsessed with avenging his murdered wife and protecting his removable car radio. The character may be an inconsistent conceit -- a craven coward one minute a skilled martial artist the next -- but Forte keeps him consistently funny. Teamed with a former comrade (a gamely flustered Kristen Wiig) and an inexperienced solider (Ryan Phillippe ably playing straight man) MacGruber sets his sights on capturing -- or preferably killing -- Dieter Von Cunth (splendidly hammy Val Kilmer) an old foe who has gained control of a nuclear weapon and whose name triggers some but by no means all of the pics coarsest dialogue. Thats all the plot a spoof like ""MacGruber"" really needs -- which is a good thing because thats all the plot it has. Although the story obviously unfolds in a contemporary timeframe the coiffures and costume designs have a pronounced period flavor much like the 80s golden oldies that clutter the soundtrack. Powers Boothe provides just a hint of wink-wink humor to his mostly straight-faced portrayal of MacGrubers superior officer. But he is allowed at least one hilarious reaction shot during a scene where the aggressively macho MacGruber gets in touch with his feminine side -- or to be more precise where the unabashedly desperate MacGruber offers to let someone else get in touch with his feminine side.

(Greg Peters/Rogue ) Joe Neumaier Friday May 21 2010 240 AM Title A bumbling special forces agent faces a villain who has a nuclear warhead.To call ""MacGruber"" a total bomb is a bit much but this comedy-action flick sure feels like it was put together with gum shoelaces and a couple of sticky Twizzlers.The first movie in a decade to spring from a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch - though the stench from those previous ones lingers like a conehead ladies man after a night at the Roxbury - ""MacGruber"" does have a novelty feel This spoof of the 1986-1992 ""MacGyver"" TV series wants to actually be an 80s action flick the kind Richard Dean Andersons former MacGyver could have actually been in (using a flashlight and a bonsai tree of course). But it fails in both execution and inventiveness. Oh the irony.As in the assorted ""SNL"" shorts and the Pepsi Super Bowl commercial from which the movie sprang Will Forte plays MacGruber one-time super soldier and special agent-turned-secret operative. Known for his personality crises in control rooms at crucial moments MacGruber has been living in a monastery for 10 years following the murder of his fiancee (Maya Rudolph) at the altar.But now villainous megalomaniac Dieter Von Cunth (Val Kilmer finding his inner late-era Brando) the man responsible for the death of the almost-Mrs. MacGruber has gotten his fat hands on a nuclear warhead. Only MacGruber can defeat him aided by his whiny-but-faithful right-hand woman Vicki St. Elmo (Kristen Wiig) and the efficient Lt. Dixon Piper (Ryan Phillippe).One major problem with ""MacGruber"" - besides the lack of anything actually funny - is ""Naked Gun"" syndrome which isnt as fun as it sounds. Thats when a character who formerly called the shots on the small screen becomes a fool after moving to the big one. So just as Leslie Nielsens Frank Drebin went from silly top dog on TVs ""Police Squad"" to befuddled goofball in the ""Naked Gun"" movies so MacGruber has morphed into a guy that everyone knows is a fool.Thats not a hoot despite Fortes amiable hamming and Wiigs endearing nervously earnest routine; their styles go toe-to-toe in a sex scene that gets a few smirks. Still they give it their all as do Phillippe Kilmer and Powers Boothe as MacGrubers former Green Beret leader. Its just never enough considering the lame script by Forte John Solomon and director Jorma Taccone.And as for that accursed ""SNL""-movie connection that follows this comedy like a long slimy tail Its deserved since those movies were almost uniformly awful with the exception of ""The Blues Brothers"" and ""Waynes World"" - the first because it was on a bigger canvas than anyone expected and the second because it was on a smaller one. You can feel the writers trying to figure out how to shoehorn the skits explosive punch line into the movie. They find a solution but not before . . . well you know.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 21 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday May 20 2010 237PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English MacGruber Directed by Jorma Taccone Written by Jorma Taccone Will Forte and John Solomon Starring Will Forte Kristen Wiig Val Kilmer Classification 18A First the good news The more derivative pop culture gets the more options you have. Consider your choices here. Option A Watch the short Saturday Night Live skit that this movie inflates. Option B Watch the original eighties TV show MacGyver which both the SNL skit and this inflated movie parody. Option C Watch this inflated movie. Now peruse the consequences of each choice A wastes but a few minutes of your precious time and may or may not yield a guffaw; B seen from the smug vantage of campy nostalgia will give you good reason to snicker at stuff that was meant to be serious; C the most pricey and time-consuming option will give you scant reason to laugh at stuff that is meant to be comic. Thus the bad news Every choice in a derivative culture is tainted by the law of diminishing returns. And that aint funny. So MacGruber assembles its SNL team - Will Forte stars Jorma Taccone directs both have a hand in the script - to huff and puff and blow up their MacGyver spoof into something resembling a feature flick. Since doing so requires something resembling a plot theres an arch-villain in possession of a rogue nuke and a volatile surname. By far the more lethal is that name Dieter Von Cunth because the verbal fallout is obvious and incessant. Shouts out the good guy ""Time to go pound some Cunth."" Later in case anyone survived the first blast he shouts it out again. That guy of course is Fortes MacGruber a world-saver who wears his mullet down his neck and his buffoonery on his sleeve. The latter needless to say forms the bulk of his arsenal occasionally brandished like a blunt instrument but more often elevated into bombastic idiocy the WMD of Hollywood humour. Apparently his sole superpower is the ability to transform from macho motor-mouth to crybaby at warp speed. For instance when cornered the baby unzips his pants and mewlingly offers his nemesis the chance to do something unamusing that I cant repeat in these hallowed pages. Yes thats how the SNL boys freed from the niggling censors of network TV have taken advantage of their big-screen adventure - by doing unamusing things that wouldnt be allowed on the small screen. On the bedrock of such artistic liberty movies are made. One more example. On those occasions when the baddies have him surrounded MacGruber doesnt stoop to the unrealistic behaviour of most action heroes shooting and punching and otherwise whacking his way through the entire assemblage. Rather he creates an ingenious distraction by (1) stripping completely naked and (2) sticking a stalk of celery up his butt and (3) strutting about like a plucked ostrich with a green tail. Warning Do not think that come the next wave of baddies such hilarity doesnt bear repeating. My apologies Ive neglected to mention the other performers in this tour de force of movie magic. Val Kilmer Ryan Phillippe and Kristen Wiig all appear - one wears a ponytail another does not yet another is called Vicki St. Elmo. Ill leave you to play mix-and-match along with the further warning that it may soon be ""Time to go tickle some Elmo."" Me Im off to check the critical returns elsewhere on the cultural ledger sheet - your faithful if diminishing accountant on his never-ending quest.

Theres a reason youve never seen the words ""Will Forte"" topping the billing of a major motion picture. After the throbbing flameball of unfunny that is ""MacGruber"" you never will again. This mock actioner based on the ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch spoofing the 80s show ""MacGyver"" is all about TV It features the pacing of C-SPAN the production values of the public-access channel the writing acumen of Home Shopping Network. The chief joke is that the bad guy is named ""Cunth."" How bad is this movie? So bad that critics werent allowed to see it until four hours before it opened. So bad that to play the villain it was forced to hire the lumpy inert remnants of what used to be Val Kilmer. PHOTOS SNL ON THE SILVER SCREEN Fortes MacGruber -- Stallone meets Clouseau -- is a military macho man in a Jon Bon Jovi shag pulled out of retirement by a colonel (Powers Boothe) who needs him to track down the evil Cunth who years ago killed MacGrubers wife and recently stole a nuclear weapon he plans to use to kill the president. Its unclear who that president may be Though everyone is styled like the 80s and theres a giant picture of Reagan on the colonels wall everyone also has up-to-the-minute cellphones. Its also unclear who the main character is For two-thirds of the movie MacGruber annoys his partners -- a young soldier (Ryan Phillippe) and his wifes best friend (Kristen Wiig) -- by being a stooge and a coward who bungles every detail. Yet suddenly in the last act for no reason he becomes an expert assassin who knows how to disable a nuclear missile. Unlike the arrogant but essentially childlike Clouseau MacGruber never makes you root for him nor says anything funny. His jerky remarks wouldnt draw a laugh in the average middle-school boys locker room ""Did I remember to tell you how ugly I think you are?"" ""If you think hes so handsome why dont you marry him?"" Hes not a likable oaf but a loathsome creep who does things that arent amusing over and over (like playing Big 80s power ballads on his car stereo then removing it from the dashboard). ""MacGruber"" never comes close to making even a mildly satiric point -- at the expense of for instance the patriotic mid-80s American he-man flick -- because its so focused on silly clothes and butt jokes. Forte prances naked except for a celery stalk sticking out of his hindquarters a gag so pathetic that you neither laugh with him nor laugh at him. You just want to give his mom a hug. Later in the movie Phillippes character is asked to do the same thing -- but Phillippe obviously refused because the movie awkwardly cuts to a body double. Cant-miss opportunities are missed a montage sequence about assembling tough guys for the team doesnt contain a joke -- except that one of the guys is gay. ""MacGruber"" even wastes the reason for its existence -- the readily spoofable MacGyver trademark of manufacturing lifesaving gizmos out of household items. Almost an hour into the movie MacGruber is shown rounding up some bric-a-brac and then -- nothing. ""I dont know what Im doing and everybody hates me"" cries our hero in the most accurate line of the movie. Comedy just isnt his Forte. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Glee producers eye Susan Boyle for cameo Read Next Glee producers eye Susan Boyle for cameo Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 33242 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 24408 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 18443 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

The calculated solution perfect for these days of The Hangover and other over-the-top humor Work blue forget the plot and throw so many gags at the screen that some of them have to stick.You may have seen the skit. A smirking MacGyver-like action hero (Will Forte) with a knack for low-tech gadgetry is trapped in a room with his loyal sidekick (Kristen Wiig) that weeks guest star and a ticking bomb. Things generally dont end well. This would be difficult to sustain over the course of an entire movie and the MacGruber team wisely doesnt try. Instead they amp up MacGrubers ineptness with a raunchy brand of ""I know you are but what am I?"" schoolyard humor and turn loose a grab bag of straight men led by Powers Boothe and Ryan Phillippe to supply the reaction shots. Movie Information MacGruberRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Jorma TacconeStarring Will Forte Kristen Wiig Ryan Phillippe Val Kilmer and Powers BootheRun time 99 minutesMPAA rating R (strong crude and sexual content violence language and some nudity)Synopsis Possibly the greatest American hero 16 Purple Hearts three congressional Medals of Honor and seven presidential Medals of Bravery figures hes the only one to save the world.More movies from GuideLive.comNecrophilia scatology celery in uncomfortable places These are the tools of MacGrubers comic trade mixed in with generous doses of violence. At its best MacGruber which wasnt screened for the press until the night before opening works as a daffy send-up of 80s action movie and TV conventions right down to the ubiquitous pop-music strains. (Youll never listen to Mr. Misters ""Broken Wings"" in quite the same way). At its worst and there are ample swaths of dead space here MacGruber mistakes the merely outrageous for comic genius without bothering to set up its gags or create recognizably human characters (The Hangover did both of these things which is why its a big cut above its imitators). What you have here is a live-action R-rated cartoon; all it needs is an anvil falling on a coyotes head.Two people make MacGruber better than it needs to be. Wiig who has been one of the only reasons to watch SNL for a few years now has a wonderful talent for keeping a straight face amid all manner of inanity. Shes the perfect self-deprecating straight woman. Val Kilmer who continues to carve out a nice second career as a character actor shows the lack of shame and pretension that comic villains need.MacGruber manages to move beyond sketch comedy dimensions but at 99 minutes its still a reach. The ""tick tick tick"" you hear isnt that pesky bomb.
