Comments Bangkok Dangerous Nicolas Cage stars as a well-paid assassin who travels to Thailand to kill four people in this loose remake by the Pang brothers of their 1999 film. While Cage is appropriately laconic and surly as a loner whose only ties are to the people who hire him his performance is unusually flaccid. The story includes several overused plot devices including the cliched final job with a big payoff that will allow Cages character to retire permanently but when he allows a Thai gofer into his locked-down world and decides to train him things go predictably awry. While the film includes several exciting creatively shot action scenes the drama is otherwise so shopworn that the violent climax is a relief. With Shahkrit Yamnarm and Pamward Hemmanee. R 100 min.

Actually describing it as having ""action"" is charitable. There are indeed shootouts and chases. After all Cage plays an assassin -- thats all part of his gig. But twin Hong Kong directors Danny and Oxide Pang dont bring a whole lot of life to this story of killing which shockingly wasnt screened for critics before opening day. In remaking their own 1999 movie of the same name the Pang brothers have smothered everything in a layer of greenish-gray grit making even the rare daytime shots look like theyre taking place in the wet gloopy dead of night. With ""Bangkok Dangerous"" Cages hangdog demeanor and constant constipated expression dont do much to engage us. He stars as a hit man named Joe -- get it? Like hes your average Joe like you could be an assassin too if you were to explore your darker impulses. Edgy stuff there. The script finds Joe performing that hackneyed one last job when a Bangkok crime boss hires him to take out four enemies. Only the bad guy turns out not to be as trustworthy as Joe initially thought. Thankfully Joe is a creative sort (the drowning in a hotel pool is clever both in its execution and in the way it is shot and edited). But he also finds time to mentor a young pickpocket turning ""Bangkok Dangerous"" into a deadly version of ""The Karate Kid.""

"Return to Bangkok isnt worth the trip - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-BangkokMOVIE REVIEW Return to Bangkok isnt worth the tripSeptember 08 2008|Michael Ordona | Special to The Times For those unfamiliar with the Pang brothers audacious 1999 ""Bangkok Dangerous"" the new version starring Nicolas Cage will seem like any other fast-food bullet ballet. Viewers who recall that original burst of adrenaline however will be left with hunger pangs.The two movies share a title directors character names -- and little else. Even the city in this edition feels less like the seamy gritty you-are-there Bangkok of the first film than some scrubbed polished Vegas notion of the Thai capital. Although the uninitiated might not know what theyre missing theres not much otherwise to hook them in what becomes a standard tired-warrior-finds-meaning-of-life wants-out-of-the-killing-biz yarn.Cage plays Joe a stoic assassin who could use some Zoloft but instead sullenly drifts from murder to murder. In Bangkok to execute a series of tasks he hires Kong a handsome local petty crook (Shahkrit Yamnarm) as an errand boy and inexplicably but inevitably befriends him. Theres a love interest too as Joe becomes bewitched by cute deaf Fon (Charlie Young) (thats a woman; its not that interesting a film). Will Joe connect with his humanity? Will the bad guys inspire a hail of hot lead? Will anything happen that you havent seen before?Yes yes and not really. There is a handful of visual touches that support the Pangs reputation as cinema stylists. Otherwise theres nothing new here. The two most memorable aspects of the original -- a scrappy deaf-mute assassin lead (Kong not Joe in that version) and a seedy visceral visit to the titular city -- survive only in pieces.Jason Richmans mimeographed screenplay offers such assassin-fest gems as ""Dont pull the trigger; squeeze."" Its also telling that in the new film Kong is reduced to the Gunga Din role while the exotic object of affection for the powerful American takes on the original leads muteness. Losing those qualities that made the protagonist unique reduces Cages character to a Frankensteins monster of previous screen killers minus the spark that might have animated it.The virtues of this film -- better called ""Bangkok Dangerous The Vegas Experience"" -- are well spaced. Theres a charming restaurant scene some nifty hand-to-hand combat and the cast is great looking. But pretty much all the things that made the original so original are filtered out of this un-original.--""Bangkok Dangerous."" MPAA rating R for violence language and some sexuality.

Nicolas Cage stars as Joe a paid assassin in Bangkok Dangerous a bleak remake of a 1999 Asian shoot-em-up. With his shaggy hair Cage looks like a refugee from an 80s British pop group. Spandau Ballet anyone? The length of his locks changes dramatically from one shot to the next once disconcertingly during the course of a single meal. And the film contains some of the most obvious uses of stunt doubles you will ever see. In the tough-guy voice-over at the start of the film (""Bangkok Its corrupt dirty and dense"") Joe explains the four inviolable rules he has followed throughout his career. Then on his final assignment - four separate targets in Thailand - he sets about breaking them one by one. Why Joe why? His biggest mistake is letting down his guard with Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) a petty thief he has recruited as his legman. Kong becomes Joes apprentice taking a crash course in the lethal arts of the profession. Were not going to count Joes puppydog infatuation with a deaf-mute pharmacist (Charlie Yeung) as a further lapse in judgment because its just too preposterous to believe. But then none of Joes motives or behavior makes sense in Bangkok Dangerous. No sooner has the film established him as a killer with ice water in his veins than he turns into a big softie melting like a schoolboy for a pretty smile. The Pang brothers who directed this film (and the original) serve up some decent postcard shots of Thailand. But the action scenes are surprisingly mundane. The entire film is shot with a sepia tone that gives it a flat documentary feel. But in any light Bangkok Dangerous is a dark grim film with no emotional traction and little plot. As a cinematic experience its like being locked in a coffin for an hour and a half.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at dhiltbrand phillynews.com or 215-854-4552.

Joe Neumaier Friday September 5 2008 111 PM In the torpid barely-awake voiceover that opens ""Bangkok Dangerous"" Nicolas Cages world-weary assassin sleepily intones his credo which includes this rationalization ""The work is steady the moneys good ... but its not for everyone.""That sums up Cages current career alright. And ""Bangkok Dangerous"" -- a remake of a 1999 Thai thriller directed as this new one is by Hong Kong filmmakers the Pang brothers -- adds to the sad realization that this once-vibrant and witty actor is completely controlled now by his inner teenager. Now thats not the teenager whose starring debut in 1983s ""Valley Girl"" still amuses. No the teenager Cage seems to want to be is a metal-head videogame addict with dyed-black hair and a love for fast cars easy thrills and cardboard heroes. If only this kid could crawl back into his parents basement wed all be better off.Cages killer -- ""Joe"" were told his name is -- roams the world from job to job never interacting with others and getting paid loads to do his job fast efficiently and anonymously. But arriving in Thailand Joe incongruously takes a street grifter Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) and turns him into his protege. Then he falls in love with a deaf salesgirl (Charlie Young) and sure enough his days as the guy who can wipe out strangers while cruising by on a motorbike or in a boat begin to end.To its credit ""Bangkok Dangerous"" does have an over-familiar but still eye-catching color scheme (gun-metal blue with a candy-apple red final shoot-out) a luxurious score by Brian Tyler and between bursts of violence a contemplative mood. The problem is theres really nothing to contemplate. Except perhaps that Joe and the deaf salesgirl are like a modern-day version of ""City Lights"" if the flower girl was an empty vessel of desire and Chaplin had chopped off guys hands.Actually there are two other things to consider Cages embarrassing Alice Cooper hair and the trajectory of his fame. Of the former all that can be said is it looks like it was ripped off a mannequin with the waxen scalp still attached. As for the latter complaints have already been made many times so heres a smattering of Cages credits before his Oscar win for 1995s ""Leaving Las Vegas"" ""The Cotton Club"" ""Birdy"" ""Raising Arizona"" ""Moonstruck"" ""Red Rock West"" ""It Could Happen to You."" And heres a sampler of what came after ""The Rock"" ""Con Air"" ""Snake Eyes"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" ""Ghost Rider"" ""Next."" And now of course this thing.Wow. Talk about a face/off.

Mister Foe Wednesday September 3 2008 at 542 p.m. By LA Weekly 1 A Girl Cut in TwoAliceleo Cinema A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - BABYLON A.D. Hardly the utter fiasco promised by its lengthy delay and no-press dumping on Labor Day weekend Mathieu Kassovitzs Babylon A.D. arrives shorn of 10 minutes of its European running time and God knows what else cut before the film ever made it into any theater. In a vague post-apocalyptic future mercenary Toorop (Vin Diesel) hides out in Russia until mobster Gorsky (Gerard Depardieu) hires him to smuggle Aurora (Melanie Thierry) into the U.S. Unsurprisingly two factions led by cult actors -- Lambert Wilson as Auroras father on one side and the ever-freaky Charlotte Rampling as mom a.k.a. High Priestess the CEO of the Neolite sect on the other -- attempt to kill them along every step of their journey. Whats missing here are the seeds that would explain what Kassovitz increasingly seems to be angling for in the back half a dystopian vision of a society in which organized religion is the exclusive pretext for global corporate dominance. Without whatever strident critique Kassovitz intends its a typical B action movie -- the inevitable pseudowarm bonding scenes deadly the fights largely incoherent -- with the occasional pleasing set piece. If nothing else its nice to see an action movie that takes Europe not America as its grounding point. And depicting Russia as the worlds future dominant power suddenly seems oddly prescient. (Citywide) (Vadim Rizov)BANGKOK DANGEROUS By way of introduction globetrotting assassin Joe (Nicolas Cage) tells us the rules for survival as a hitman the most important being Dont get emotionally attached to anyone. As soon as he breathes those words during his cold-as-ice voiceover alert moviegoers will instantly peg Bangkok Dangerous as another of those dopey crime thrillers where the hardcore bad-ass antihero inexplicably decides one day to lower his guard and open his heart causing all kinds of hell to break loose. Adapting their 1999 Thai film Hong Kong directors/brothers Oxide and Danny Pang (The Eye) start things off promisingly draping the Bangkok locations in a sleek neon sleaze that suggests lowdown B-movie pleasure. But soon Joe whos in town to kill four targets takes in troublemaker Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm) as his apprentice and falls for the deaf-mute shopkeeper Fon (Charlie Yeung) and the sinking realization kicks in These people are taking this nonsense seriously. What follows is a series of ponderous training montages -- shoot those melons Kong -- and painfully precious courtship scenes between Joe and Fon stranding an audience that just came to see some cool shoot-em-ups. They do happen eventually but not before Joe reveals his soft side by bonding with an elephant. You heard me. (Citywide) (Tim Grierson)COLLEGE Film critics never come home stinking of their honest labor but the nearest equivalent is reviewing something like College which leaves its stain on ones very humanity. Three high school bros on a college visit -- a dork a gelatinous loudmouth and a faintly sympathetic straight man with anime-character hair -- run afoul of a frat marshaled by a smug Van Wilder/that-Sugar-Ray-guy amalgam who subjects the boys to Sadean hazing. (He also has the one funny line ""What the fuck do you know about welfare reform?"") And so begins a morally numbing gauntlet run through mechanical decadence surpassing even the straight-to-DVD soul-gangbanging American Pie Presents The Naked Mile. ""Queef"" ""tossed salad"" Verne Troyer and the ol fist-pump open-mouth tongue-in-cheek blowjob pantomime are utilized just as though they were jokes (what kids -- no ""donkey punch""?). The overall mood is limply obligatory as if everyone involved had been court-ordered to make a raunch-fest party flick (director Deb Hagan only tunes in during her one tracking shot). One cant imagine theres an actual screenplay behind this -- somebody seems to think Fatty is so good you can just let him riff. Nearly justifies traveling back in time to preemptively kill Edison Muybridge and the Lumiere brothers. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)DISASTER MOVIE In the Adam Sandler vehicle Little Nicky Hitler spends eternity in Hell in a frilly smock getting pineapples shoved up his butt. Compared to anyone watching Disaster Movie he got off light. Rushed into production with no better drape for its thread-bare gags than Cloverfield -- unless you count such proud upholders of the Irwin Allen tradition as Juno Enchanted and High School Musical -- this carpet-fouling mongrel of a movie no more deserves release than do anthrax spores. Visually an eyesore comically a much-lower-seated pain its the same as writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzers other (fill in the blank) movie parodies only somehow uglier and lazier. Ugliness and laziness can sometimes work to comedys advantage but not here -- not when the level of inspiration is someone answering a Get Smart shoe phone only to smear his face with dog crap.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  A GIRL CUT IN TWO Claude Chabrol who should soon be shooting his 70th feature is at once wildly prolific and utterly faithful -- at least to the conventions of the commercial thriller. Darkly droll his A Girl Cut in Two updates the scandalous case of the celebrated fin de siecle architect Stanford White -- shot dead by the jealous young millionaire who married Whites teenage mistress a showgirl. An old-fashioned cineaste Chabrol came to the story by way of its 1955 Hollywood version The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing though he transposes it to contemporary Lyons. Charles a successful novelist and practiced libertine (played with seasoned suavity by Francois Berleand) vies with Paul the young unstable heir to a pharmaceutical fortune (given a memorable foppish swagger by Benoit Magimel) for the favors of an innocent TV weather girl Gabrielle (wide-eyed luscious Ludivine Sagnier). Confident yet vulnerable Gabrielle falls for the (much) older guy and in love for the first time allows herself to be debauched by this veteran roue. Then after a nasty breakup and an ensuing breakdown on the rebound she marries the preening young fool -- thus effectively incinerating them all. A Girl Cut in Two is a spry piece of work and although directed for mordant comedy the spectacle of a naive lower-middle-class womans misadventures in a nest of wealthy vipers is initially unsettling and ultimately gut-wrenching. (Nuart) (J. Hoberman)LOVE AND HONOR At 76 Japanese writer-director Yoji Yamada is still best known in his homeland for a one-time Guinness Book record-holding series of four-dozen films (the Tora-san series) all with the same plot about a traveling salesman who is unlucky in love. That resolute consistency carries over to Love and Honor the third leg in Yamadas melodramatic samurai trilogy (following the Oscar-nominated The Twilight Samurai and The Hidden Blade). Here again are the familiar feudal class themes and low-ranking samurai protagonist Newly appointed to be a food tester for a local lord Shinnojo (Takuya Kimura) eats an out-of-season shellfish and goes blind. He falls into suicidal despair until a chance to exact revenge upon a head clerk who has bedded his wife leads to the trilogys third mano-a-mano showdown. If youve seen the others youll know not to expect Zatoichi action in this blind mans duel; Yamadas refined Merchant-Ivory approach to the Edo era (slow pace genteel storytelling restraint) produces more yawning than fawning. At least the guys dependable. (Music Hall; One Colorado) (Aaron Hillis)GO  MISTER FOE Young Hallam Foe (Jamie Bell) is convinced that his stepmother (Claire Forlani) accelerated her upward trajectory from Dads secretary to Dads wife by offing his mom but the coroner says it was suicide. An unswayed Hallam channels his grief and loathing into spying on couples going at it Dad (Ciaran Hinds) and Stepmom primarily. After sleeping with the latter he runs off to Glasgow finds a doppelganger for his deceased parent in Kate (Sophia Myles) and sets about spying on her in the bedroom. These are unlikely components for a comedy -- which Mister Foe against the odds definitely is. Co-writer/director David Mackenzie has jokingly claimed this as the capstone of his ""sex trilogy"" (2003s mostly celebrated Young Adam and 2005s mostly ignored Asylum preceded it) a threesome (har) of films extrapolating a single idea In Mackenzies world wholesome sex is a possibility for other people but never for the (anti-)hero whose couplings are always the sublimated expression of something else. What makes Mister Foe such unlikely fun though is Bells accomplished smart-ass routine and Mackenzies blithe attitude toward taboos. Every possible voyeuristic/incestuous kink gets a workout. ""I like creepy guys"" Kate declares but she doesnt know the half of it. (The Landmark) (Vadim Rizov)GO  PING PONG PLAYA Documentary filmmaker Jessica Yu takes a breather from chronicling heavy-duty outsider artists (In the Realms of the Unreal) and extremists (Protagonist) to try her hand at a popcorn send-up of identity politics you can take the kids to -- and its not half-bad. Burdened with a perfect older brother and marooned in disdain for his ping-pong-obsessed suburban Chinese-American family Chris ""C-Dub"" Wang (a character worked up from a sportswear commercial by Ping Pong Playas production accountant/co-writer Jimmy Tsai who also plays him with dumb-ass brio) succumbs to a severe case of homeboy envy talking ghetto and shooting baskets with little kids while stewing in a dead-end job and blaming his failure to make the NBA on his short stature. Chris is a good if rather too long-running joke and its fun that Yu and Tsai who know their Asian-American bourgeoisie through and through skewer the hypersensitivity of minorities with the same acuity that they take down white condescension. Frantically paced littered with cute kids and overstuffed with split screens and a rap score Ping Pong Playa angles a little too hard for tween attention but theres no resisting the movies antic affability or its irreverence even with Chris unavoidable progression toward the mature appreciation of his roots.

""And this is what I do."" Hes making reference to being a hitman but the actor might as well be talking about himself His name is Nicolas Cage and this is what he does -- take the big bucks to star in slovenly inert pulp of the sort no actor of his magnitude should be stooping to. In Bangkok Dangerous the Pang brothers remaking their 1999 Thai thriller turn Cage into a scruffy blank-eyed cipher of an assassin who has been hired to kill four men; we learn so little about them that they flash by like the bad guys in a trailer. The filmmakers even manage to turn seamy Bangkok into the least exotic setting imaginable.

A remake of an Asian actioner the film follows Nicolas Cages taciturn hitman as he struggles to get out of the assassination game. The surprise is that its really not that bad its punchy and efficiently directed and in those brief moments where Cage drops the grimace and stops shooting people he reminds us what a likeable actor he was before action heroism beckoned. None of this compensates for the overfamiliar plotline the underdeveloped side characters the breakbeat soundtrack the boring shootouts and a general air of overbaked silliness. But it helps.

By Anthony Lane Nicolas Cage is an assassin on holiday in ""Bangkok Dangerous.""   Credit ROBERT RISKO Movies are a brotherhood. Wherever you look there are siblings fighting for space behind the camera. The heyday of the Taviani brothers may I fear be over but we still have the Coens who are on a roll. In the agonized corner we have the Dardenne boys of Belgium and facing them those naughty Wachowski kids from Matrixland. Soon you wont be able to approach a studio without a blood relation in tow; look out for the long-lost Peregrine Eastwood and a delicate new project from Ang and Chuck Lee. In the meantime here come the Pangs. Danny Pang and the rousingly named Oxide Pang are twins from Hong Kong best known for their 1999 hit ""Bangkok Dangerous."" This they have now remade for the English-speaking market titling it after a lengthy period of reflection ""Bangkok Dangerous."" The city is described in voice-over as ""corrupt dirty and dense"" in contrast to the characters who are uniformly fair-minded well scrubbed and partial to quantum mechanics. Nicolas Cage plays Joe London which I strongly suspect of being an alias. He has a sheaf of passports at his disposal together with explosive devices a high-powered rifle and other appurtenances of the discerning man-about-town. Joe is an assassin by trade but then these days who isnt? Assassins are to the movies what plumbers are to ordinary life theyre trained theyre overpriced they never call back but sometimes theyre just what you need. ""Holiday"" Joe says when asked by Thai customs what he is doing in Bangkok and his vacation plans include the murder of four men. To match that he has four instructions for any aspiring killer dont ask questions dont take an interest in people outside the job erase every trace of your presence and get out when you can. I can think of American Presidents who have followed these rules to the letter whereas Joe proceeds to break them all. The last twenty minutes of the film for instance are taken up with an entirely superfluous diversion to a factory yard where he takes the opportunity rather than leaving the country to waste as many of its citizens as he reasonably can. Earlier he makes nice to the assistant in a local pharmacy and in an unprecedented breach of homicidal protocol invites her out to dinner. This is intended to demonstrate his softer side just when we were getting used to the idea that he doesnt have one yet his choice of date is a giveaway she cant speak. Much the same goes for Aom (Panward Hemmanee) the dancer who acts as a link to Joes employer and who communicates mostly through her hips. In short we are back in the territory of ""The Departed."" Martin Scorseses Oscar winner adapted from a Hong Kong original was far superior to ""Bangkok Dangerous"" but it too tamped down the presence of women as if they were a threat to its manly postures. In both cases we are left with the unpalatable sense of females being welcome to join in so long as they dont open their mouths. There was a time when Nicolas Cage with his hangdog barks of irony could have shouldered some of the womens work mocking his own penchant for excess. Now however the more ridiculous his films become the more seriously he takes them--and the more presumably he is paid to do so. The Cage of ""Wild at Heart"" and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" found life to be engrossingly weird and treated it accordingly whereas the Cage of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" intones a line like ""Theres a beer in the refrigerator"" as if he were reading from the Book of Micah. He appears sunken throughout understandably depressed by his long ropy mane of black hair; from a certain angle hes a ringer for Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders. Only once does the Cage of yore flicker into view. It happens when Joe enlists the services of a resourceful thief who introduces himself as Kong (Shahkrit Yamnarm). ""Kong?"" Joe repeats with a smile and a drawl as though wondering when the guy is going to stop fingering wallets and start climbing the nearest tower. It would be heartening to report that the Pangs inject new blood into the action movie a noble genre now verging on the anemic. But Hollywood and the television industry have long since sucked what they require from the tropes and rhythms of Asian films and parts of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" far from seeming unfamiliar or freshly stylized offer nothing that you couldnt catch in an episode of ""CSI."" Traffic lights aside the color scheme ranges all the way from dirty white to steely gray-blue reinforcing the solemnity of the tale. Gunplay is intercut with closeups of bangled feet and floating lotus blooms subtly indicating that it takes all sorts. And so the movie grinds on diligently skirting every chance to surprise. As the brothers Pang export their brand of busy gloom around the world following ""Bangkok Dangerous"" with ""Moscow Expensive"" and ""Geneva Pleasantly Safe"" is this what we can expect from the globalization of cinema? Will movies wherever they hail from end up looking the same? The original title of ""Mister Foe"" when it opened in Europe was ""Hallam Foe"" and that was a better fit. Its the name of the central character played by Jamie Bell and one thing he never feels like is a Mister. First he doesnt turn eighteen until halfway through the movie; and second he hardly slots into society with the assurance--either the ease of body or the confidence of spirit--that would lead anyone to call him Mr. Foe. On the one occasion when a friend at work does use that term of address it is said with a sour snarl as if to caution Hallam not to grow up too fast. If Master Foe has a foot in childhood its because he is half an orphan. His father Julius (Ciaran Hinds) is still alive but his mother committed suicide not long ago and Hallam is wrapped in a wrathful grief. The Foes inhabit a large and lonely house by a loch in the wilds of Scotland and the isolation chimes with Hallams mood; he crouches in a tree house on the grounds and daubs his face with makeup as if it were war paint. His prized possessions include a badgers pelt which he drapes over himself so that his head is crowned by that of the beast and one of his mothers dresses into which he occasionally slips for dead times sake. Most vital of all are his binoculars; Hallam has forfeited his place in the world for a chance to spy on it. His chief victim is the brisk and beautiful Verity (Claire Forlani) who has usurped his mother in Juliuss affections. Hallam flees to Edinburgh and goes into a kind of upward free fall seeking refuge not on the citys streets but on its empty roofs. He takes a job washing dishes in a fancy hotel largely because the head of personnel Kate (Sophia Myles) reminds him of his mother. Not content with that he finds a perch behind the giant face of the clock in the hotels eaves camping out there at night and gazing across through his trusty binoculars at Kates apartment where she entertains her lover Alasdair (Jamie Sives). From this vantage Hallam creeps into her presence and eventually into her bed she being--luckily for him and for the plots progress--one of those women who are able to declare with a straight face ""I like creepy guys."" The director David Mackenzie (who also wrote the script with Ed Whitmore) doesnt slide around the contrivances of the story; he greets them head on hailing it as perfectly natural that women far from being repelled by the Oedipal itches of his hero should feel the urge to soothe them. That is true not just of Kate who at one point sits with legs crossed like Lorraine Bracco in ""The Sopranos"" and interrogates a naked cowering Hallam about his desires but of Verity who reappears in his life and sums up its guiding goal ""How is it with your look-alike? Do you feel like youre fucking Mummy?"" Behind ""Mister Foe"" lies a bundle of Hitchcock highlights ""Psycho"" is here of course in the sons contorted longings; ""Rear Window"" remains the template for all voyeurs; and there are whispers of ""Rebecca"" in the mysterious death by water of a first wife. Mackenzie is wise enough however not to try to ape the manners of the Master as well as his themes; ""Mister Foe"" is shifty and jolting to look at immune to the charms of urbanity and sprinkled with a rash of plaintive songs courtesy of bands such as Franz Ferdinand and drums that knock like heartbeats. Some of the best things in the movie zip by as if to offset the earnestness of its main conceit blink and youll miss the blink of Kates eyelid framed in extreme closeup as she fends off Hallams question ""Is Alasdair your boyfriend?"" with the lying rebuff ""God no hes got a wife and a kid."" The vigor and saltiness of her couplings with Alasdair like the dirty talk between her and Hallam show that Mackenzie the creator of ""Young Adam"" (2003) has lost none of his taste for the explicit. ""Mister Foe"" flirts too often with the unlikely and the foolish yet there is something to admire in the nerve of its reckless characters so uneasy in their skins. If you cant take sex or violence be warned theres no violence here but the sex looks like violence and that makes it doubly difficult to forget.

Heavy on the spice and cheap on the meat ""Bangkok Dangerous"" adds plenty of Thai seasoning to the Hollywood lone-assassin recipe but the result is only mildly pungent. Rehashing certain elements -- including striking location shooting -- that marked their much grittier 1999 feature of the same title Hong Kongs Pang brothers increase the decibel level of the gunshots and the schmaltz level of the scenario but such embellishments not to mention a Nicolas Cage doused with Clairol make this hefty remake seem less dangerous than incongruous. Low September B.O. body count should be surpassed by acceptable ancillary returns. Twins Danny and Oxide Pang made their dual-directorial debut with the Thai-language version of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" whose effective lowlife atmosphere and wide-ranging stylistic palette propelled them onto the international scene. They followed with the original 2002 ""The Eye"" and its two local sequels before debuting Stateside with last years moody horror tale ""The Messengers."" Working here with a script by Jason Richman (""Swing Vote"") the helmers reshape their rough Bangkok underworld-set story into a cleaner tourists take on crime and corruption. Yet without the technical nastiness and fatal realism that made the initial film so compelling the remake feels like a hollow excuse to present the myriad ways in which a bullet can pierce a cranium rather than an edgy portrait of Third World violence. As in the original pic follows the gloomy itinerary of solitary gun-for-hire Joe (Cage) who in the opening scene takes out a high-profile target in Prague then coldly eliminates his assistant via lethal injection. With no hints as to what exactly pushed Joe into such a dirty business were left to work with the few personal guidelines he repeats in a voiceover used sparingly throughout. Arriving in Bangkok to execute four contracts he hopes to be his last Joe quickly finds himself immersed in the citys ""corrupt dirty and dense"" lifestyle which the filmmakers effectively (albeit hastily) render through neon-lit street shots and strobing nightclub scenes. Hiring local henchman Kong (Thai actor Shahkrit Yamnarm who delivers the films most endearing turn) to serve as a middleman he successfully knocks off the first three targets in more or less professional fashion. Exterior-based assassination sequences highlighted by a lengthy boat chase set inside a picturesque floating market make the first half easier to digest. But Joes sudden and unexplained character change midway through marked by his growing teacher-student relationship with Kong and his altogether platonic affair with an attractive pharmacist (H.K. pop singer and ""New Police Story"" star Charlie Young) is never fully fleshed out and adds little resonance to the multiple killings that follow. Lively Bangkok locales offer up a colorful urban portrait that winds up being much more complex than the scripts underdeveloped characters. Working with usual cinematographer Decha Srimantra (who lensed their three ""Eye"" productions) and production designer James Newport (""Brokedown Palace"") the Pangs manage to bring back some of the exotic grit of the first film although the imagery here is more postcard-like. Cage gives a mostly laconic perf yet at times cant seem to hide his joy at shooting in so many cool locations which adds a befitting sense of wonder to his humdrum persona. Co-stars Young and Yamnarm are both solid actors who unfortunately disappear in the films final stages. Kinetic score by Brian Tyler is mixed with several cheesy pop tunes played at a racy Bangkok dance club which in this U.S.-friendly version features only scantily clad but no nude entertainment.
