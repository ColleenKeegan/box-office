(Sept. 3 2011) Photo Credit Getty Images advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW BOTTOM LINE A one-joke comedy that overcompensates with smutty icky humor. CAST Nick Swardson Christina Ricci Don Johnson LENGTH 136 The story of a budding porn actor undeterred by his ahem shortcomings ""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star"" aims to be the grossest comedy of the year and may well succeed. Unfortunately this inverse version of ""Boogie Nights"" is also icky and repellent in ways it probably did not intend. Nick Swardson a Comedy Central regular transitioning to the big screen (he also appeared in ""30 Minutes or Less) plays Bucky a low-IQ Iowan with Bugs Bunny teeth and a Mason Reese bowl-cut -- a man-child straight from the playbook of Adam Sandler who co-wrote and co-produced. While watching a nudie flick at a friends house Bucky realizes that the writhing bodies are his parents (Miriam Flynn and Edward Herrmann) who apparently once specialized in aroma-fetish films (thankfully never explained). Thrilled by this discovery Bucky decides to follow in their footsteps and heads to Hollywood. advertisement | advertise on newsday Although Buckys anatomy turns out to be lacking the filmmakers cant stop there; they also give Bucky a carpet of body-hair and the lovemaking skills of a caged chimp. When a video of this repulsive creature begins burning up Internet bandwidth porn director Miles Deep (Don Johnson oddly endearing) realizes that Bucky makes inadequate guys feel like bedroom heroes. Soon Buckys growing fame threatens to unseat porns reigning king (Stephen Dorff). Aside from Johnson the only other actor who escapes this mess with dignity is Christina Ricci expertly balancing earnestness and silliness as Cathy McGee a kindly waitress who falls for Bucky. Swardsons sweeter nature occasionally peeks out but the film ploddingly directed by Tom Brady (no relation to the far more graceful pro quarterback) is overly obsessed with smut vulgarity and excretion. It opens with a joke about two goats and a grinning farmer and only gets worse from there.

Growing up in Iowa hes never seen sushi or convertibles and he doesnt understand complex concepts like birth control or English language slang. Nevertheless when Bucky (Swardson) learns his parents were porn stars he heads to Hollywood to enter the family business. Born to Be a Star isnt funny but maybe thats the point. After all its hero becomes an adult film icon despite his big buck teeth and a little problem with premature ejaculation. So perhaps the inept humor is just one facet of a larger tribute to ineptitude---a cinematic celebration of inadequacy. Oh who am I kidding? This movie is dire soul-crushing stuff.Follow Matt Singer on Twitter mattsingerWatch the trailer See more in Film Posted Tuesday September 13 2011 Details Release details Rated R Release date Friday September 9 2011 Duration 96 mins Cast and crew Users say LiveReviews|01 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out worldwide Follow us Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out Chicago Site map },http://timeoutchicago.com/arts-culture/film/14942015/bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-film-review,200,buckylarsonborntobeastar1,buckylarsonborntobeastar,com/arts-culture/film/14942015/bucky-larson-born-to-be-a-star-film-review

The movie was made by people who have succeeded in the comedy industry despite not being funny. Write what you know I guess. This awful thing awful even by the usual standards of awful things is the first starring vehicle for Nick Swardson a once-promising stand-up comedian who has cast his lot with the Adam Sandler posse. After co-writing Grandmas Boy and The Benchwarmers he has written this awful thing with Sandler and Allen Covert and it has been for want of a better word ""directed"" by Tom Brady. This is the Tom Brady who made The Hot Chick and The Comebacks not the Tom Brady who plays football although whos to say which of them is better at making movies? The football Tom Brady would probably have the good sense NOT to include a scene where a farmer applies peanut butter to his crotch and has goats lick it off so he might have the advantage over filmmaker Tom Brady who lacks such discretion. Swardson plays the title character a naive sexless Iowa man-child with buck teeth and a pageboy haircut. I mention his teeth and hair because the movie also mentions them -- constantly in the form of other characters mocking them. (They teach that on the first day of Lazy Comedy Writing 101 for easy laughs give a character an abnormality and just have everybody make jokes about it) One night Buckys friends introduce him to pornography which Bucky has never heard of and masturbation which Bucky has also never heard of. He is instantly a fan of both even after also discovering in the worst possible way that his own square nerdy parents (Edward Herrmann and Miriam Flynn) used to be popular porn stars. Now that the cats out of the bag the Larsons share with Bucky their fond memories of making porn and he is inspired to go to Los Angeles to follow in their footsteps. I think were supposed to find it automatically funny that the conservative Iowans are proud of their work rather than embarrassed by it and while that is indeed the germ of a good comedy premise (remember the Mr. Show sketch about a mom-and-pop sex store?) the movie doesnt do anything to cultivate it. Thats typical of the whole awful thing actually. You can spot individual moments or situations that could have been developed into funny scenes only nobody bothered to develop them. So Bucky leaves Iowa -- a weird part of Iowa where everyone speaks in thick exaggerated Minnesota accents by the way -- and sets out to find his destiny. The non-joke once he arrives in L.A. is that he is so clueless and borderline retarded (several people ask if he is) that he has no idea how life works. He sees a flier for an open audition and assumes its for a nudie film because he apparently thinks thats the only kind of film there is? I guess? Hes never seen a regular movie before? Or something? Anyway he goes to the audition which is for a macaroni-and-cheese TV commercial and takes off his pants. Again great potential in the idea of an actor going into the wrong audition with the wrong thing in mind. But WHY does he have the wrong idea? What led to his misinterpretation? He does eventually find his way into the actual porn industry where the non-jokes are that he has a tiny penis and that he climaxes immediately simply by being in the same room as a naked woman. A third-tier porn director Miles (Don Johnson) thinks there might be a niche market for this kind of incompetent sexuality and he turns out to be right and Bucky is a star. His one L.A. friend a sweet waitress named Kathy (Christina Ricci) with a dumb dream of her own encourages him while the industrys leading porn actor (Stephen Dorff) seethes with jealousy. You might expect a film like this to makes jokes about porn stars the porn industry or show business in general. Youd expect it to at least make jokes about sexuality and its place in society. But you would be wrong. Swardson and his associates show no interest in ... well in anything really. They give Bucky an L.A. roommate played by Kevin Nealon whos mean to him but no reason for the meanness or any direction for it to go. That failure is repeated constantly resulting in a movie that isnt even a series of skits but a series of vague ideas for skits that nobody fleshed out.

Adam Sandlers Happy Madison production shingle often alternates between the stars own bigger-budgeted vehicles and decidedly downmarket pics featuring his buddies. The latter category reaches an almost impossibly low nadir with the Nick Swardson-starring porn-industry comedy ""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star"" one of the most astonishingly unfunny films of this or any other year. Judging from the pics dismal opening-day numbers (it was not screened for critics) this may be one of those rare cases in which the general public decides there are certain cinematic troughs to which it simply will not descend. Aside from its failures on the technical narrative and humanitarian levels ""Bucky Larson"" applies a brain-dead kidpic mentality to hard-R subject matter. For a film centered entirely around the sex trade the pic is terrified of anything resembling actual human sexuality and hardly features any nudity. (Pity the poor 12-year-olds who bother theater-hopping into this one.) Several dozen euphemisms for intercourse and genitals are heard throughout and few were likely previously uttered outside a grade-school playground. Directed by Tom Brady and scripted by Sandler Swardson and Allen Covert the pic starts out in rural Iowa a slower simpler place where families gather for nightly Yahtzee matches and old men casually smear peanut butter on their penises for roaming goats to lick off. Bucky (Swardson) a creepily virginal man-child with a pageboy haircut and protruding prosthetic beaver teeth still lives here happily with his parents (Miriam Flynn Edward Herrmann) until discovering in the worst possible way that they had a prolific past as fringe 70s porn stars. Somehow untraumatized by this experience he decides its his destiny to follow in the family business. Hopping on a Greyhound to L.A. he falls into the good graces of a golden-hearted diner waitress (Christina Ricci) who sets him up with a psychotic roommate (Kevin Nealon) and against all basic biological instincts becomes his girlfriend. Buckys stud aspirations seem doomed by the little matter of his microscopic endowment and tendency to violently ejaculate in response to anything more titillating than a slight breeze but a down-on-his-luck porn director (Don Johnson) sees potential in a performer who will make male viewers feel more confident about their own abilities by comparison. Through all this one feels nothing more strongly than an acute sympathy for all involved -- in particular Ricci who gives her role more than it deserves and Herrmann a classy character actor who once won a Tony. Swardson has been a dutiful team player in Sandlers bullpen for years but seems unlikely to break out of supporting status with this as his first starring role. Stephen Dorff is alone in generally seeming to have fun with his part as a preening rival woodman but thats not to say that hes ever actually funny. Production values are uniformly hideous but theyre the least of the films problems.

(John Ales) Joe Neumaier Friday September 9 2011 849 PM Title Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star A Iowa goofball becomes an adult film star. With Nick Swardson Christina Ricci. Director Tom Brady. (136) R Language nudity sexual situations. At area theaters.There are movie atrocities there are I-just-dont-get-it comedies and then theres ""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star."" This god-awful unfunny stinkingly putrid sketch-comic movie has exactly one snicker-worthy moment involving Kevin Nealon and a stolen grape. But watching the rest of it will make you whine.Co-written and produced by Adam Sandler - the movie resembles the worst Xeroxes of Xeroxes of some of the stars higher-concept lowbrow efforts - ""Bucky Larson"" features Nick Swardson (""30 Minutes or Less"") as the title man-child a buck-toothed Sandler-sounding loser living with his parents in Iowa in what looks like the 1980s but is apparently just an attempt to be witty.When Bucky discovers his small-town yah-hey-there parents were porn stars in the 70s the former grocery-store bagger goes to Hollywood to follow in their footsteps. Laughed at by a porn mogul (Stephen Dorff so far away from the minimal career he had) Bucky first finds solace with a sympathetic waitress (Christina Ricci looking forward to those ""Pan Am"" checks) then porn success after meeting up with a washed-up XXX director (Don Johnson earning a little credit for dialing the movie down).The secret to Buckys success? Its the kind of punchline drunken college boys would bust a gut over while crank-dialing pharmacies (the nature of which was seen earlier this summer in ""The Hangover Part II"" if you were paying attention). But to see Swardson with his ""Dumb amp; Dumber"" haircut and Halloween-store gopher teeth flail about as he does his ""thing"" repeatedly over the course of the movie is enough to make your head explode.Director Tom Brady (""The Hot Chick"" - hey look hes got a new low point) uses Sandlers corny underdog-makes-good formula and fleshes it out with adult-film star jokes that were old when Tracy Lords was young. Goofy side characters abound including Nealon as an unhinged wanna-businessman who takes the nai ve Bucky in as a roommate and yells at him of taking his food including that grape we mentioned.That snicker is the loneliest sound throughout all of ""Bucky Larson"" which stands alone as the most moronic comedy in ages.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Share Tweet In the dire new Happy Madison movie Bucky Larson Born To Be A Star obligatory love interest Christina Ricci describes herself as ""banished"" to a chintzy little diner where her dreams of being a big-time waitress died an unmourned death. Its easy to see the actress behind the role Riccis part here represents a seemingly permanent banishment from the A-list. Its less a performance than an enduring embarrassment. Bucky Larson cant even get the ""arbitrary"" part of the ""arbitrary love interest"" right; to its detriment the film takes Riccis dreams of being a glamorous waitress so seriously that it throws off the storys balance. Ditto her romantic relationship with a gawky overgrown child (Nick Swardson who also co-wrote) with grotesquely small genitalia. Apparently no one told Ricci she was acting in a comedy not a touching drama about a young woman overcoming a formative trauma to achieve her dreams. In a lead performance that answers questions of his viability as a cinematic leading man with a resounding ""Oh hell no"" Nick Swardson stars as a big-hearted Iowa misfit with buck teeth a bowl haircut and little ambition. His life is turned upside down when he discovers that his seemingly wholesome parents have a secret history as major porn stars of the 1970s. Filled with a delusional sense of destiny Swardson attempts to make it in the porn industry in spite of his microscopic cock complete lack of sexual experience and inability to understand movies sex life the entertainment industry the world around him and language Hes essentially a child in a mans body which lends an element of symbolic pedophilia to a romance that would already be creepy under the best of circumstances. Is there a staler target for satire than the porn industry? Is there any humor left to be gleaned from describing X-rated acts in G-rated language? Bucky Larson suggests there isnt yet it plunges ahead all the same powered by little more than co-writer and Happy Madison capo Adam Sandler who stubbornly insists that silly accents and stupid haircuts are inherently funny. (See also Little Nicky.) In true Happy Madison tradition Bucky Larson undercuts the scatological slapstick shenanigans with a heaping helping of corn. It isnt enough for us to laugh at Swardson Were asked to feel for him as well without being given any reason to do so.

Daily Edition Login to download Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star Film Review 228 PM PDT 9/9/2011 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Columbia Pictures More likely to be a footnote to Adam Sandlers producing career. TWITTER Nick Swardson Christina Ricci and Don Johnson star in the Adam Sandler-produced comedy about a man who yearns to be a porn star. Its telling when Adam Sandler produces a movie but doesnt cast himself in the leading role. The latest effort from the comedy auteur stars his frequent cohort Nick Swardson as a buck-toothed under-endowed Iowan farm boy who journeys to Hollywood to become a porn star. Unfortunately the R rating will prohibit the target audience -- namely teenage boys who find penis jokes endlessly hilarious -- from seeing this relentlessly unfunny and vulgar effort until it shows up on video and cable. Not surprisingly the distributor declined to screen the film in advance for critics. Bucky is a hapless grocery store bag boy who discovers during a masturbation lesson conducted by his helpful friends that his loving parents (Edward Herrmann Miriam Flynn) are actually former porn stars from the 70s. Determined to follow in their footsteps he boards a bus for Los Angeles and eventually finds his way to the Valley where he manages to land an audition with washed-up adult film director Miles Deep (Don Johnson doing a relaxed comic riff on Burt Reynolds character in Boogie Nights). Although Bucky is as one character puts it ""hung like a ladybug"" he displays a singular talent for immediate and explosive uh appreciation for his female co-stars who he never gets close to actually touching. That along with his ability to make average-sized men feel better about themselves by comparison soon makes him an Internet sensation and the hottest if certainly not the biggest porn star in the business. Featuring endless jokes about the lead characters humungous molars and enough spraying semen on display to make the famous ""hair gel"" scene from Theres Something About Mary seem quaint the film -- co-written by Sandler Swardson and Allen Covert -- is about as funny as the typical scribbling on a public bathroom stall. Although Swardson certainly commits himself to the proceedings its unlikely that his performance here will make the films title prophetic. Among the supporting players whose talents are wasted are Christina Ricci highly appealing as a sweet waitress who takes an unaccountable shine to Bucky; Kevin Nealon trapped in a one-note role as Buckys perpetually aggrieved roommate; and Stephen Dorff as a rival porn star. The latter at least gets to deliver the films single memorable line when he declares that ""nothing grows in my cock shadow.""

Like a bad movie adaptation of a recurring Saturday Night Live character that never existed Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star has Nick Swardsons naive Iowan move to Los Angeles in order to break into the adult-film industry despite possessing a microscopically small penis. If you snickered just now when you read ""penis"" then this is probably the movie for you. But if you managed to get all of that out of your system in middle school health class then the endless unfunny sex gags offered by the script (written by Swardson Adam Sandler and Allen Covert probably over the course of a single giggly weekend) will leave you cold. A better-deserving Christina Ricci plays Larsons doe-eyed love interest and Don Johnson is amusing in the Burt Reynolds-in-Boogie-Nights role of a sleazy pill-popping director. They are bright spots in a movie thats otherwise pretty hard to watch. Heh-heh ""hard."" D Movie Links Official Site Bucky Larson Born To Be a Star on Facebook Movies Like This Whats Your Number?

"Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Bucky Larson Born to Be a StarNick Swardson plays a rube from Iowa trying to become a porn star. Unfunny sexual euphemisms abound making for a lazy R-rated comedy.September 10 2011|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Nick Swardson and Christina Ricci star in ""Bucky Larson Born to Be... (John Ales Columbia TriStar )""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star"" is another dispiriting batch of comedy runoff from Adam Sandlers busy second- and third-banana factory at his Happy Madison shingle. This time the sputtering spotlight gets thrown on chipmunk-cheeked comedian Nick Swardson last seen doing his signature naughty-cherub thing for Sandler in the romantic comedy ""Just Go With It."" Here hes a weirdo rube from Iowa with a bowl cut buckteeth and a dream of becoming a porn star in Hollywood. For Swardson and co-writers Sandler and Allen Covert the scenario makes for an inept lazy R-rated movie whose sole purpose is as a glossary of euphemisms for genitalia and sexual acts. As is usually the case with Sandler-universe output the (attempts at) humor stem from extremes of naivetA(c) or hostility sweetness or filth. So for every instance in which Edward Herrmann and Miriam Flynn give aw-shucks performances as Buckys parents a 70s-era adult film icons whose stardom Bucky accidentally discovers and becomes inspired by a there are crass loud and resolutely unfunny figures like Don Johnsons aging bitter porn director Stephen Dorffs angry threatened porn star or Kevin Nealons mean petty roommate. The central conceit meanwhile is a goof on ""Boogie Nights"" in that Bucky hits it big in spite of his micro-endowment because he makes average Joes feel good about their own sex lives with size-obsessed wives and girlfriends. Thats about as charitable as ""Bucky Larson"" gets toward women incidentally and that includes the notion that a friendly attractive coffee shop waitress (Christina Ricci) would have anything to do in her off-hours with Swardsons abrasively awkward loon. Funny raunch is hard work a deceptive mixture of ingenious situations and well-timed shock. That puts ""Bucky Larson"" a in which cutaways to biological fluids are the height of raucousness a on the labor scale somewhere between disinterested wage slave and do-nothing temp. Swardson seems to believe his laugh-getting duties ended at the wig-and-denture stage save the occasional spasmodic mugging while director Tom Brady a once part of the Rob Schneider Tolerance Project (""The Animal"") a shows little interest in bringing any more comic verve or visual appeal than a homemade YouTube video would.

Bucky Larson Has No Idea By    Alonso Duralde on September 9 2011  918 am Follow aduralde Email Print Someone seems to have turned Nick Swardsons comedy setting to ""Obnoxious Birthday Clown"" and then yanked off the knob Bucky Larson has buck teeth. Bucky. Larson. Has. Buck. Teeth. BUCKY LARSON HAS BUCK TEETH. ucky-Bay arson-Lay as-hay uck-bay eeth-tay. Notice how that doesnt get any funnier with repetition. Too bad no one informed the people behind ""Bucky Larson Born to Be a Star"" who think protuberant malocclusion is the most hilarious thing ever particularly when its referred to over and over and over again. The bearer of that prominent overbite is Bucky Larson (Nick Swardson) a hapless goofus with a bowl haircut and an unconvincing ""Fargo"" accent. After Bucky loses his job as a grocery bagger his friends try to cheer him up with a porn movie which turns out to star Buckys parents billed as ""Jim Spraysium"" (Edward Herrmann whose dignity will surely survive this misfire) and ""Rosie Bush"" (Miriam Flynn). Bucky decides that hes a porn-star legacy and makes his way to California to make it in ""nude movies."" His screen test for washed-up director Miles Deep (Don Johnson) is a disaster -- Bucky is shall we say underequipped for the part and hes so inexperienced with women that just the sight of a bra makes his as he puts it ""brain go sparkly."" But after Buckys audition becomes an online sensation with underendowed men whose girlfriends suddenly find their guys attractive by comparison Bucky becomes a big star beating out rival Dick Shadow (Stephen Dorff) at the adult film awards. And thats pretty much all that happens except for an innocuous romance with waitress Kathy (Christina Ricci) and conflicts with an obnoxious roommate (Kevin Nealon). The script -- by enemies of comedy Adam Sandler Allen Covert and Swardson -- feels light on incident but even lighter on jokes. Bucky needs an orthodontist and he has microphallus and thats pretty much all this film has to offer in the chuckles department making it something of a chore for anyone above the age of 12. The entire premise of ""Bucky Larson"" feels like a concept thats about 35 to 40 years out of date and while the porn business is a supremely easy target for comedy this movie doesnt have any idea of what might be funny about it besides perhaps ""tee-hee -- boobies."" Swardson like earlier Sandler co-conspirator Rob Schneider has been funny on TV in small doses. (In Swardsons case he had a hilarious recurring role as a low-rent hustler on ""Reno 911"" and was the best thing about Sandlers unaired pilot ""Gay Robot."") But in feature films Swardsons more-is-more approach becomes thoroughly grating; its as though someone turned his internal comedy meter to ""Obnoxious Birthday Clown"" and then yanked off the knob. If anyone in ""Bucky Larson"" deserves credit its casting directors Lisa London and Catherine Stroud who bring their best silk-purse-making skills to the project by giving work to veterans like Flynn Ricci (if this is the best the movie biz is offering her heres hoping ""Pan Am"" takes off) Dorff Curtis Armstrong Mary Pat Gleason Nicholas Turturro and especially Johnson who makes a perfect surrogate for Burt Reynolds porn auteur from ""Boogie Nights."" This talented cast cant really do anything with the non-screenplay theyve been handed but at least they got a paycheck out of it. Although come to think of it doing actual porn might have been a more fulfilling career choice. Breaking News To Your Inbox. Sign up >> http//twitter.com/share?text=Review Whats So Funny About Porn?
