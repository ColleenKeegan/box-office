Williams High School in Alexandria Va. was integrated and the usual ugly protests ensued. Perhaps the bitterest blow to the schools racist spirit was that its popular football coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton) was demoted to defensive coordinator and replaced by a black man Herman Boone (Denzel Washington). How Boone a tough-love sort of guy got his racially mixed team playing so well that it went on to an undefeated season and the state championship is the substance of Remember the Titans. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer says the screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard first heard this story in a Virginia barbershop many years after the Titans famous victories and instantly decided that latter-day America needed to contemplate it. The producer who is normally associated with high-tech action movies is inordinately proud of the result despite the bruising direction of Boaz Yakin. Bruckheimer seems to think theyve made an art film. The films heart is surely in the right place though its hard to think how you could misplace its ticker and still have a releasable movie. In its way it beats solidly too following the rhythms of well-established cliches. First the team is ridden with mutual prejudice; then it starts to pull together. The two coaches relationship is first gnarly then affectionate. Theres a goofy kid who learns to play a star who is grievously yet inspirationally hurt in an accident and of course a kid who comes off the bench to help win the big game. Maybe its all true. But one is always a little discomfited when life or a movie imitates weary melodramatic patterns this slavishly.

Comments (1) Remember the Titans Set in the early 1970s before all men became brothers this self-congratulatory saga of a Virginia town facing integration on the gridiron is said to be based on actual events. It might be fun to guess what they were. Did the square-jawed white coach obliged to subordinate himself to a black interloper actually have a sports-loving daughter? No doubt. Was she the lippy little bundle of attitude on display in this film? No--children like her exist only in movies. Was a top white player truly laid low by a car crash? Must have been--the end credits generously tell us how many years later he died. Did the car crash occur just before the big game and anneal black and white athletes into a force equal to the occasion? Who knows? Certainly producer Jerry Bruckheimer if not God would have it no other way. The leads Denzel Washington and particularly Will Patton are so good they occasionally make you forget the material is shameless. Directed by Boaz Yakin from a script by Gregory Allen Howard.

"Remember the Titans | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; remember-the-titans ) Remember the Titans (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli With a movie like Remember the Titans your overall opinion will be largely dependent upon how you look at the finished product. If viewed as a crowd-pleasing feel-good sports movie the film is an unqualified success following the accepted formula to the expected conclusion while delivering some nice moments along the way. However if seen as a socially conscious retrospective on race relations in the South during the early 1970s Remember the Titans can best be described as timid and unexceptional. In soft-peddling the theme of intolerance the picture refuses to take even the smallest chance. From the beginning we are meant to know that the events portrayed in Remember the Titans have their roots in historical fact as if the ""based on a true story"" caption lends added credibility to the story. In reality theres probably more truth in an entirely fictional account like The War Zone than there is in a movie like this where events have been massaged to make for a compelling two hours in a theater. Aside from documentaries and docu-dramas (such as Gettysburg) it is not the duty of a motion picture to offer an unbiased and unaltered version of history. For that there are text books. This wouldnt even be an issue however if the filmmakers hadnt insisted upon linking their characters and events to their real-life counterparts of 30 years ago. Remember the Titans might have worked better if not encumbered by the words ""based on a true story"" and all that they imply. This is the second consecutive film Denzel Washington has participated in to use a fact-based narrative as a jumping-off point for making a social statement. Unlike The Hurricane (which became the target of numerous slings and arrows from those who were offended by its frequent - and justifiable - re-writing of history) Remember the Titans is not hard-hitting in its depiction of bigotry. The kinds of things endured by the characters in this film would have been minor irritants to Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter who was railroaded and falsely convicted of a murder because of his race. In Remember the Titans the worst we are exposed to is some taunting and mild name calling a brick hurled through a window and a brawl or two. In a way this underplaying of racism misrepresents it as something less pervasive and poisonous than it was (and to an extent still is). Of course the argument can be made that a serious examination of intolerance in 1971 Virginia would clash with the get-up-and-cheer tone promoted by the main storyline - that of an underdog football team banding together to defy the odds. Its a valid point - a more hard-hitting approach towards bigotry would have curdled the formula and made the film feel disjointed and out-of-focus. Given the constraints he is working under director Boaz Yakin does what he can to imply that the interaction between black and white team members represents a microcosm of society as a whole. Its a problematic solution at best but it at least gives Remember the Titans a socially relevant underpinning - even if it is contrived and at times preachy. That complaint aside I must admit to having enjoyed the film albeit largely on a visceral level. Like all sports movies Remember the Titans is relentlessly manipulative and hopelessly predictable but Yakin displays skill in the way he choreographs the expected ups and downs. And even though nearly every individual is pretty much a cut-and-dried type those whom we get to know on a first-name basis are likable. Of course the presence of an accomplished actor like Washington doesnt hurt nor does the fact that some attention is paid to giving his character depth and complexity. With the exception of a pair of bookend scenes transpiring in 1981 the film takes place a decade earlier in the town of Alexandria Virginia where the T.C. Williams High School has just been integrated. This means that not only will whites and blacks be mingling in the halls but on the football field as well. And in a place like Alexandria where every resident lives and dies with each game the composition of the T.C. Williams Titans is a serious matter as is the identity of the coach. So when the eminently qualified local choice Bill Yoast (Will Patton) is passed over in favor of an out-of-towner named Herman Boone (Washington) the citizens are in an uproar especially since they believe Boone has been selected based not on his qualifications but because of his race. The commonly held opinion is that school board hopes the presence of a black coach might be able to calm the tensions that are threatening to turn Alexandria into another Watts. Boone is initially uncomfortable with his reasons for getting the job but he vows to be color-blind in his treatment of his players. He invites Yoast to be his defensive coordinator - an offer that is reluctantly accepted. Then over the course of a grueling late-summer boot camp for would-be football players he concentrates on destroying the preconceptions of all of his charges both black and white. In the process some of the players become fast friends and Boone and Yoast develop a bond. But the teams new-found internal harmony does not necessarily reflect that of the outside world which regards the racially integrated team with mistrust and at times disdain. Washington isnt the only one to give a strong performance. He is ably supported by the underrated Will Patton who uses his baggage as a bad guy to toy with the audiences expectations. Equally convincing are Wood Harris and Ryan Hurst who play Julius and Bertier a militant black and white who become close friends. Then theres young Hayden Panettiere who steals nearly every scene shes in as Yoasts nine year-old daughter Cheryl who would rather watch football films and help the coaches than play with dolls. The movie comes from uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer whose last non-action outing was the ill conceived Coyote Ugly (he was also behind this summers Gone In 60 Seconds as well as past blockbusters like Armageddon and Crimson Tide). Bruckheimer is not one to court controversy. His trademark is to make glitzy accessible movies for wide audiences. So by toning down the racial epithets (the word ""nigger"" is not uttered once) and the violence in Remember the Titans he garners a flaccid PG for material that could easily have been a PG-13 or an R. The wisdom of this approach is questionable since it gives the impression that the films integrity may have fallen victim to a desire for commercial success. Remember the Titans is careful to avoid areas that could disturb or offend large groups of viewers. Bruckheimers director Boaz Yakin is attempting to rebound from the critical and box-office disaster A Price Above Rubies (which in turn was his follow-up to his much-lauded debut Fresh). As sports films go Remember the Titans is a notch above the average entry in part because its social message (even if it is soft-peddled) creates a richer fabric than the usual cloth from which this kind of movie is cut. The films racial slant gives the football games a little more meaning and energy and the characters come across as more sincere and less self-centered. Its a better picture than its most recent kin The Replacements which had the formula but not much else. Still when compared to a high school sports classic like Hoosiers which contained many of the same elements (albeit as applied to basketball not football) Remember the Titans shows a few flaws. Fortunately they arent serious enough to lower the films broad-based appeal or to diminish its quotient of feel-good moments.

As earnest and well-intentioned as any Stanley Kramer movie ""Remember the Titans"" grapples with the civil rights struggle with an almost cartoonlike simplicity and naivete. Using the true story of the forced integration of a 1971 Virginia high school football team to show how we can all get along if race and background are put aside for the sake of the common goal of scoring touchdowns this high-minded sports drama attempts to merge the bold-faced thematic seriousness of something like Kramers ""The Defiant Ones"" with the macho swagger of ""Top Gun."" Disneys marketing muscle placed at the service of the films reductive heart-in-the-right-place appeal and Denzel Washingtons charisma should put solid numbers on the board through the fall season. While looking like a titan indeed in comparison to the producers previous releases this year ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and ""Coyote Ugly"" this one will have pundits pondering the question Whither Jerry Bruckheimer? Has he gone socially conscious? Having earned untold zillions does he now crave artistic respectability? Is this his idea of a profound picture or is it just an appetizer for ""Pearl Harbor?"" Whatever the case the impulse to turn onto the high road after many years on the low road has certainly been seen in Hollywood many times before. To be fair Bruckheimer with his late partner Don Simpson waded into socially turbulent waters once before in ""Dangerous Minds"" but not with the inspirational intent that underlines this new film which reps the first major studio outing for helmer Boaz Yakin. As simplistic and drained of complexity as the picture is it may well appeal to mainstream audiences as an ""if only it could be like this"" fantasy as well as on the elemental level of a boot camp training film albeit a PG-rated one with all the cuss words removed. Framed by the funeral service for one Titan player 10 years later first-produced feature script by TV scribe Gregory Allen Howard zeroes in on how it went down at T.C. Williams High in Alexandria Va. when blacks were introduced to the previously all-white school. Because training begins in the summer the football program is integrated well before any black student sets foot in a classroom and the whole process gets off to a poor start as far as the community is concerned when a black coach from South Carolina Herman Boone (Washington) is brought in to replace a revered and successful white coach Bill Yoast (Will Patton). Although Yoast initially refuses to consider working in a subordinate capacity and his players come close to sitting out the season they shortly show up for practice with Yoast in charge of the defense. A self-described ""race man"" who walked with Dr. King Boone is also a born drill sergeant who makes his attitude perfectly clear at the outset ""This is no democracy. This is a dictatorship. I am the law."" Faced with aggressive competitive muscular young men of both races whose mutual mistrust erupts into sporadic racial brawls Boone forces them to deal with one another by assigning opposite-race roommates and adopting other measures. He also demands not just excellence but perfection from his players which adds to the pressure. Among those brought to the fore among the dozens of hopefuls are hardcase black quarterback Julius ""Big Ju"" Campbell (Wood Harris) who initially wont give any white kid the time of day; the hostile white All-American team captain Gerry Bertier (Ryan Hurst); upbeat fleet-footed receiver Petey Jones (Donald Faison); the gigantic and gregarious Lewis Lastik (Ethan Suplee) the only player who couldnt give a damn if someones black or white until the arrival from California of Ronnie Bass (Kip Pardue) whose long blond hair earns him the nickname ""Sunshine."" With his powerful left arm Bass poses a threat to Big Ju at QB and his carefree attitude about racial matters makes him seem like an alien to those raised south of the Mason-Dixon line. In training at a rural facility at a safe remove from society at large the guys are put through brutal drills including forced runs in the middle of the night one of which ends up at Gettysburg enabling Boone to make an inspiring speech about history and sacrifice. By the time they return to Alexandria the kids are in fighting trim and so purged of their old suspicions and biases that they seem genuinely shocked by the protests and uproar that greet the first day of school; thrown together in the front lines of racial strife the footballers have survived the first battle and should they be able to forge a winning season are in a position to lead the way for the rest of the community. Yarns second half charts the teams path to the state finals with the series of briefly re-enacted games embellished by illustrative details of the unsavory racial climate a brick is thrown through Coach Boones living room window Bertiers blond girlfriend leaves him since he seems to prefer the company of his black teammates one white player avoids making blocks so that black players stand a better chance of getting hurt Boone is led to believe that hell be fired if he loses so much as one game and biased officiating becomes more common the closer the Titans get to the championship. But no matter how many times a racist foot is stuck out to trip Boone and his right-minded men virtue triumphs to the predictable accompaniment of swelling music and recycled pop tunes plenty of hugging and backslapping and applause all around. Were all brothers under the skin and all that especially when theres music playing and our team is winning. Aside from its message-waving pic dedicates itself to entertaining the audience via its military-style whip-em-into-shape training antics the sort of thing that always goes down very easily. Although hes denied the salty dialogue that ordinarily comes with the territory (just as the countless racist characters on view are never allowed to say the n-word in this decidedly family-oriented film) Washington seems to greatly relish playing such a kick-butt authoritarian figure; pic depicts his tough medicine as just what it takes to cleanse these young men of their mutual suspicions and boiling blood. Its an engaging performance even if half of his lines are platitudes and the rest orders and instructions. Patton and Hurst effectively play the two white characters whose gradual coming-around symbolizes the dawning of understanding that the film posits everyone will need to experience if society is to improve. Harris and Faison register nicely as the most prominently featured black athletes Pardue and Suplee stand out as the two wild cards in the bunch and Hayden Panettiere is almost frighteningly precocious as Yoasts daughter a 9-year-old who knows more about football than do most of the guys. Shot in Georgia rather than Virginia pic is technically sound except for the coverage of all the nighttime football action; the lighting is garishly unattractive and excessively tight framing emphasizes the games physical impact at the expense of play-making clarity.

The picture produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and based on a true story is set in 1971 just after the Alexandria Va. school board has been forced to integrate a local black school with a local white one. The role of Herman Boone a football coach assigned to head up the new racially mixed squad at T.C. Williams High School allows Washington to be a morally righteous crusader and at the same time to have fun with the role of an equal-opportunity drill sergeant who treats each team member regardless of race with a blend of relentlessness and respect. Boone like all great coaches may be a bit of an SOB but hes an SOB who cares. Boones appointment displaces Bill Yoast (Will Patton) a white coach with Hall of Fame credentials who is suddenly working under him. Washington has to deliver a few too many lines like ""Youre overcookin my grits coach"" but his interplay with Patton a saucy actor whose aint-I-charming defensive smirk lends him a disquieting resemblance to George W. Bush is the best thing in the movie. Boone carts the black and white players off to a special training camp and as their wills get smelted and remolded by his hammering three-a-day workouts so do their prejudices. Except that the film can hardly wait to get all corny and back-slappy. The players become instant best buddies engaging at one point in a locker-room sing-along of ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"" (a great song that should be banned from movies as a feel-good soul tonic). The jock-lite camaraderie is like something out of a telephone commercial Its reach out and touch your fellow linebacker. Back in town the Titans new solidarity is tested by a society still mired in racism -- and by a script thats willing to trot out the cheapest tricks in the inspirational hacks playbook (the white girlfriend whos a cartoon bigot a crucially timed auto accident). In a movie this treacly and glib you can bet the team that plays together -- racially that is -- slays together. Denzel Washington by now could do this sort of role in his sleep. To his credit he gives a wide-awake performance but its time that he took on a character with a few more startling dimensions.

Remember The Titans Movie Review (2000) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/remember-the-titans-2000,200,rememberthetitans8,rememberthetitans,rogerebert
"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Home | Register               Web Search Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Ham-Fisted Titans By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 29 2000 Denzel Washington plays a football coach in an unrecognizable Alexandria. (Walt Disney) Out on the sidewalk after a recent screening of ""Remember the Titans"" a new ""fact-based"" football melodrama set in Alexandrias T.C. Williams High School in 1971 an audience member was overheard to say ""Alexandrias going to be real [ticked] off about this"" With good reason. Set during the dawn of the Northern Virginia citys attempt to integrate its school system the film purportedly tells the story of Herman Boone in real life the T.C. Williams Titans first black football coach and his heroic efforts to forge a championship team by forcing detente down the throats of the warring white and African American players. Cutting to the chase the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced Boaz Yakin-directed white guilt trip wastes no time presenting a picture of 1971 Alexandria as a racist backwater with a population of country music-lovin yall-drawlin crackers so virulently anti-black it will make the D.C. suburb virtually unrecognizable to those who live there today. Im not saying there wasnt racial tension but to this D.C. native (whose vision of his across-the-river neighbor may have been clouded by the ivory tower of his integrated private high school in Northeast Washington) Alexandria looks like the Deep South. ""Our boys arent playin for some Coach Coon"" sputters a vein-popping apoplectic cousin of Bull Connor in this Birmingham-on-the-Potomac upon learning that politely stoic new arrival Boone (the always dignified Denzel Washington) has been hired over the longtime Coach Yoast (Will Patton set on a low boil) an angry but basically fair-minded Caucasian whos ready to walk rather than suffer the indignity of the assistant coaching slot that is until his white players tell him they wont hit the field without him. Yoast stays of course in the subordinate position and the mutual respect friendship and yadda yadda yadda that over the course of the season evolve out of his and Boones initial mistrust is a wondrous thing to behold. In reality Boone and Yoast remain fast friends to this day even if the Disney-fied over-simplification of their assuredly complex relationship is enough to make you gag. Now I dont mean to sound like Im against peace love and understanding happy endings male bonding or tales of uplift and personal redemption but I get a bad taste in my mouth when Im force-fed the pap in a broth of swelling strings stirring martial rat-a-tat-tats and dubious pseudo-sociologizing about the ability of sport to bring races and nations together. I get enough of that propaganda from the Olympics. Furthermore the Boone-Yoast rapprochement isnt even the main point of the story-heck it would have been a better movie if it were. ""Titans"" is less concerned with that fairly grown-up sub-plot than it is with showing us a surly bunch of black and white teenage jocks learning to open cans of whup-ass not on each other as it turns out but on their opponents a perennial favorite of Hollywood storytellers regardless of their heroes skin colors. The young actors who play the Titans are all fine by the way particularly Ryan Hurst and Wood Harris as sworn enemies-turned-best friends Gerry Bertier and Julius Campbell (otherwise known as the main white kid and the main black kid). So are Washington and Patton for that matter given what they have to work with in the bathos of Gregory Allen Howards mawkish script which never met a moral it couldnt club you over the head with. The long-suffering heroic black players are all portrayed as decent (if understandably angry given the atmosphere of overt hostility) but with few flaws that might flesh out or sully their characters purity as symbols in the civil rights struggle. The white players on the other hand range from the villainous to the buffoonish to the saintly. ""Remember the Titans"" is a feel-good movie only in the sense that it wants to reassure todays white people about our own enlightenment and how far weve come in the evolution of our attitudes about race. If the bigoted pigs (and I have no doubt there were many both white and black) inhabiting this mythical Alexandria of three decades ago were more contradictory more real instead of some hick caricatures the message of the story might have become too complicated. As it is its a fairy tale. Deep down however ""Titans"" just wants to win-our hearts and our self-congratulatory tears-without consideration as to how the game (or the film) is played. In that sense its just another manipulative football movie with balletic slo-mo of athletes slamming into one another over the sounds of beef being sledge-hammered and all of this as a metaphor for spiritual growth. Toss it in the bin along with ""The Replacements"" but give it bonus points at least for having a social conscience. Remember the Titans (PG 113 minutes) - Contains a fistfight and racial hostility.

Poitier Wood Harris Donald Faison Alan Bosley Craig Kirkwood Ethan Suplee and Kip Pardue in Remember the Titans. Gaining Ground / Sport bridges racial divide with a minimum of cliches in `Remember the Titans 1 / 2 Back to Gallery REMEMBER THE TITANS Drama. Starring Denzel Washington and Will Patton. Directed by Boaz Yakin. (PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Remember the Titans"" shows that its possible to make a sentimental drama that isnt sickening -- and a sports movie that transcends cliches. Based on a real-life drama that played out in Virginia it uses football to tell a bigger story about the American South going through the growing pains of desegregation. The subject is handled with sensitivity and the characters even those on the wrong side of history are treated with humanity and respect. The year is 1971 and two high schools in Arlington Va. -- one white one black -- have been combined. This means bringing together the two football teams. These guys dont just have to tolerate each other. They have to play together. Denzel Washington plays Coach Boone who is brought in from out of town to become the head coach of the Titans. This is a blow to the schools current coach Bill Yoast a kindly revered figure who by no means deserves to lose his job. Eventually Boone and Yoast decide to get along just as the team must decide to get along just as the school and community must decide to get along. Yoast takes a job as defensive coach under Boone and the men grow into a working relationship. ""Remember the Titans"" makes a compelling case that the behavior of these men had a lasting effect on race relations in Arlington. Refreshingly the movie doesnt go in the usual directions. Coach Boone is not the typical easygoing Denzel Washington character but a rigorous taskmaster who according to Yoast flirts with the ""line between tough and crazy."" The white guy in this case is the softie and yet both men stand to learn a lot from each other. As played by Washington Boone is more than tough. He is a man of keen observation and restraint and some of the films best moments provide a glimpse into his inner world. In one scene he points out that Yoast without realizing it tends to coddle the black players. ""Dont patronize them"" Boone tells him. Most movies have trouble portraying teams whether theyre football players companies of soldiers or merry bands of computer whizzes. ""Remember the Titans"" has its share of walking cliches. Theres the obligatory enormous defensive tackle for example and another character whose only personality note is that he likes to sing. Yet for the most part the film succeeds where other movies have failed finding ways to personalize its characters. Ryan Hurst is particularly memorable as Bertier a white All-America player who starts off the film loyal to Yoast and hostile toward Boone. Bertiers inner growth is rendered by Hurst largely without dialogue. Its all in his face. At first resentful of the black players he becomes increasingly disgusted at the prejudice around him. Hurst gives us the beautiful spectacle of a very young man slowly but definitely coming into his humanity. These high school kids supposedly 16 and 17 years old are played by grown men some of whom look to be pushing 30. One wonders how the film might have been with actual teenagers playing teenagers. Perhaps the loss in acting values would have been a bad trade for authenticity. One would hate to do without Wood Harris for example as Ju a black player whose friendship with Bertier sets an example for the rest of the team. In its last 40 minutes ""Remember the Titans"" gets a little schmaltzy with a succession of scenes in which one character tells another all the wonderful things hes feeling inside. But the film earns its emotional moments and it takes the audience along. The good news is that whenever the tear-and-a-smile stuff threatens to go overboard the film pulls back and gives us another scene on the football field and all the football scenes are strong. ..
