The answer two Tyrannosaurus rexes. They arrive in the night in the middle of a muddy rainstorm to rescue the infant thats been stolen from their nest by mercenary hunters. Were on Isla Sorna a mountainous tropical paradise in Costa Rica where happy packs of dinosaurs roam the forests in ecological harmony. Our heroes Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and his paleontologist girlfriend Sarah (Julianne Moore) have come to photograph and study the creatures but leave them otherwise undisturbed. Theyve freed the baby T. rex from captivity and taken it back to their techno-trailer where theyre desperately trying to put a splint on its broken leg. (File that one under ""Easier said than done."") Its then that Mommy and Daddy show up -- two giant scaly reptile heads complete with epic yellow incisors peering into the windows on either side of the trailer. This is the first time in the movie weve set eyes on the grandest of all reptiles and we expect some good old-fashioned primitive mayhem. But the T. rexes frankly dont seem all that upset. Rather than say making a hungry play for Dr. Malcolms thigh they decide after retrieving their baby to knock the trailer halfway off a nearby cliff an act that results in much hanging-in-the-air suspense but not much in the way of wrathful-dinosaur spectacle. I dont know about you but restraint is not something I expect -- or particularly want -- in a T. rex. Then again perhaps these two specimens are just reflecting the caution of their creator. In The Lost World Steven Spielberg gives us many many dinosaurs -- T. rexes velociraptors stegosauruses some nifty little green bronto-beasties that leap all over you like leeches -- and he choreographs their movements with a magicians sense of play. The movie at its best is good fun deft scary engrossing. Yet its never great fun. In the original Jurassic Park we had the thrill of seeing dinosaurs rendered for the first time with jaw-dropping realism on screen. Apart from the sheer novelty of the computer-generated effects Spielberg seemed enraptured right along with his audience by the primal wonder and terror of dinosaurs by these beasts so mammoth and ancient they seem less prehistoric than pre-earthly animal gods of a mythical kingdom. As a movie Jurassic Park was fairly clunky (when youre Steven Spielberg it may be hard to look at a theme park with irony) yet it had a wide-eyed supernatural zeal. The director brought off a variation on what hed done in Jaws He got us exhilarated by our own fear. Now working with a more supple version of the computer technology employed in the first film (as well as with animatronic models) Spielberg sends his dinosaurs scurrying through a fantasy island full of redwoods and vines and mist. This lost paradise which were told is where John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) bred and kept his dinosaurs is like an echo of the primeval fairy-tale jungle in the 1933 King Kong. When a herd of stegosauruses lope across a stream you feel you could reach out and caress their stubby hides. The T. rexes eventually do get angry clomping after people with the same comically fast horizontal waddle they had in the first film. (At one point two of them bite into a man as if sharing a piece of taffy.) The raptors jump gnash and smash things with their iron-hard heads -- their intelligence is there in the speed of those ominous directed leaps. In almost every scene Spielberg is working to give us more. Yet what he doesnt give us is more imagination. The raptor scene is nicely done with some vivid funny moments (like one raptors slide down a Spanish-tile roof onto the head of another) yet its less ingenious than the first films choreographed kitchen showdown. The Lost World is like a busier less joyful remake of Jurassic Park. Spielberg sets up two packs of rival explorers Dr. Malcolm and his team of eco-friendly ruffians and the corporate raiders who want to take the dinosaurs back to civilization for profit. The movie though is too jittery to develop its characters. As a demonic big-game hunter a kind of Ahab/John Huston figure who wants to look a male T. rex in the eye and shoot it dead Pete Postlethwaite with a shaved head and a lurid glower is meant to be an update of Robert Shaw in Jaws yet his obsessive quest isnt allowed to reach a climax. All thats really at stake in The Lost World is abstract action -- i.e. whether Steven Spielberg can hold on to our attention for one more scene. When one of the mammoth T. rexes finally does make it to civilization (downtown San Diego to be precise) were suddenly in the realm of Gorgo and The Beast From 20000 Fathoms. Except that Spielberg offering a camp gloss on the giant-reptile-on-the-loose genre doesnt have his heart in it. He forgets that we come to a movie like The Lost World not to wink at our giddy childhood fantasies but to lose ourselves in them.

The good news about ""The Lost World Jurassic Park"" is that the dinosaur creations are even better than those in the first film --- credible breathtaking and frightening. As for the rest every department pales by comparison. Still the film provides sufficient visceral thrills and visual delights to engage audiences and rack up bronto grosses. It remains the picture most likely to succeed this summer even if Universal and Amblin may have to settle for somewhat diminished returns. Following up on the highest-grossing film of all time was bound to be a daunting task. The good news about ""The Lost World Jurassic Park"" is that the dinosaur creations are even better than those in the first film -- credible breathtaking and frightening. As for the rest every department pales by comparison. Still the film provides sufficient visceral thrills and visual delights to engage audiences and rack up bronto grosses. It remains the picture most likely to succeed this summer even if Universal and Amblin may have to settle for somewhat diminished returns. The premise is that 80 miles from the original ""Jurassic Park"" there was Site B the island locale where the prehistoric animals were engineered and shipped off to the failed theme park. And as the amusement attraction was being undone by man the scientific base was destroyed by a hurricane. Though it was presumed the dinos died for want of a life-giving chemical they found the element in nature and have been thriving unmonitored ever since. In the words of mastermind John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) ""life will find a way."" The idea now is to send in a small expedition to chronicle the progress. The quartet is composed of documentarian Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) operations specialist Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) paleontologist Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) and reluctant returnee Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). Malcolm agrees only because he recognizes the lurking danger and hopes to get girlfriend Harding off the island as quickly as possible. The arrival at Site B is a reminder of what made ""Jurassic Park"" so memorable. The seamless interplay between modern man and extinct creatures is pure magic. But as with the first picture any sense of serenity is short-lived. First Malcolms daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) is discovered having stowed away on the expedition. A short time later a second much larger team descends from the skies for less honorable pursuits. Led by Hammond nephew and corporate chief Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) this crew of mercenaries is on a mission to capture a selection of bygone species for display in a new San Diego park. It doesnt take long for the tables to turn. Soon the hunters become the prey and both groups have to join forces and wiles to ensure their return to civilization. Along the way their ranks are seriously depleted by the likes of Velociraptors and Tyrannosaurus Rexes. David Koepps script from the Michael Crichton novel is schematic and largely predictable. Theres an obvious threat and not too many ways to quell it. Underneath the technical virtuosity is a standard chase film and director Steven Spielberg does little to elevate it dramatically. His skill at making the audience jump at the appropriate moment is nonetheless intact and in the absence of a strong story and well-delineated characters thats a mighty important asset. The cast mostly founders with sketchily written parts. Goldblum elevated from foil to leading man is given double duty as hero and comic relief. He simply isnt provided with the ammunition to anchor the film. Moore and Howard are also saddled with thankless archetypal roles. Only Vaughn and Pete Postlethwaite -- as a big-game hunter with a passion to go toe-to-toe with a T-Rex -- rise above the materials limitations. The most textured performance may indeed come from a matriarchal carnivore wholl stop at nothing to protect her youngster. While pic is slickly produced Janusz Kaminskis photography seems rather self-consciously arty for the genre. Its rife with back-lighting to accentuate the eeriness of night and fog. Otherwise the film moves at a breathless clip that almost makes one forget the thinness of the plot. Few filmmakers have been able to replicate the success and artistry of an all-time popular hit in a sequel. Theres simply too much baggage and anticipation. Whats surprising about ""The Lost World"" is an almost slavish duplication of horror conventions of the past including many from the Spielberg canon. An unquestionably potent formula it nonetheless evaporates quickly because of its reliance on manipulation. One gets a queasy feeling for instance about making Malcolms daughter a mulatto. Is it a sincere statement or demographically inspired? In the rear-view mirror the picture is calculation at the expense of inspiration. Theres no question that all the right buttons are hit by a master craftsman. Like popcorn its a tasty fun ride without a great deal of nutritional value.

Starring Jeff Goldblum and Julianne Moore. Directed by Stephen Spielberg. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area Theaters.) The dinner bell rings loud and clear in ""The Lost World Jurassic Park"" which comes stomping into theaters today. T. rexes loom over the trees looking to split some human snack in half like a piece of beef jerky. And velociraptors leap and gambol in the grass like psycho kangaroos just itching to take a chunk out of Jeff Goldblum. The biggest sequel of the summer has more dinosaurs better special effects and more action than the original ""Jurassic Park"" the 1993 film that went on to become the biggest money-maker in history. But the inspiration is gone and with it most of the fun. ""The Lost World"" has the vibe of ""obligatory sequel"" exactly what director Steven Spielberg presumably wanted to avoid. Four years ago people went home after ""Jurassic Park"" and looked at their pets differently. The family dog or cat seemed dangerously carnivorous. ""The Lost World"" lacks that impact and not just because its the sequel. The film loosely based on Michael Crichtons novel takes the premise of a terrific monster movie and does something very silly It mucks it up with fake environmentalist sentiment. Here the dinosaurs are no longer cruel crazed creatures from a time beyond our imagining. Theyre just misunderstood. They need our help. A promising opening sequence creates the false hope that Spielberg has developed a sense of humor about the material. A scene in which a little girl is attacked by a pack of itty-bitty cute dinosaurs ends on a comic note with mom looking on in wonder and horror. But after playing the wonder and horror card for laughs Spielberg starts playing it in earnest and he keeps playing it. Its the movies signature cliche. Someone looks off and we see the astonishment before we see its cause. Goldblum whose dry wit was a delight in ""Jurassic Park"" is back as Ian Malcolm an expert in chaos theory. But here his humor seems self- conscious and forced like the relentless wisecracking in a bad Bob Hope movie. In a series of clumsy expository scenes we get the setup. Theres another island with dinosaurs on it -- an island without cages -- and Malcolms scientist/sweetie (Julianne Moore) is already there. Hoping to lure her back to civilization he joins an expedition made up of a technician with beef jerky written all over him (Richard Schiff) and a nice-guy environmentalist (Vince Vaughn). What makes the effects in ""The Lost World"" more extraordinary than in ""Jurassic Park"" is that here its harder to know where the blue screen ends. While in the earlier film the dinosaurs were usually consigned to the background in ""The Lost World"" theyre everywhere -- left and right background and foreground. Our amazement is muted by the fact that weve seen a lot in the last four years. Now that anything is possible the act of just doing something because its possible seems no more than a vulgar use of resources. TO LESSER EFFECT The slap-happy paleontologist played by Moore may look on with awestruck giddiness at a family of stegosauruses but the audience just wonders why she thinks this is such a big deal. Hasnt she seen the tornado effects in ""Twister""? Or the White House blowing up in ""Independence Day""? ""The Lost World"" presents a clash between the nice scientists who want to study the dinosaurs and the evil corporate types who want to exploit them for profit. Their scheme amounts to nothing worse than capturing a handful of dinosaurs and bringing them to the San Diego Zoo. But in ""The Lost World"" thats positively diabolical. The most egregious Spielbergian moment comes in the scene in which the corporate types ensnare some brute dinosaur with ropes. The camera slowly pans to the faces of the kind scientists looking on in sympathy and horror at mans inhumanity to dinosaur. It doesnt help an action movie when the heroes are imbeciles. Here the good guys bring every misfortune upon themselves. They deserve to be lunch. In one scene the paleontologist and the environmentalist set the leg of a baby T- Rex who lies on the operating table blinking like a baby bird. Guess who shows up next? Mommy. GOING DOWNHILL From there ""The Lost World"" reduces itself to a series of loosely linked set-pieces Theres the one with the scientists van about to go off a cliff -- a literal cliff-hanger made more suspenseful by a nifty cracking-glass effect. The scene goes on for about 15 minutes before resolving suddenly and unconvincingly to the triumphant strains of John Williams soundtrack. Theres a lot of triumphant mu sic in ""The Lost World"" but no triumph. There is however a pretty good velociraptor sequence with the merry green creatures terrorizing the good guys in a shed. From there the action moves to San Diego with a T-Rex thundering through Spielberg country -- glistening suburban neighborhoods -- and stopping traffic on city streets. The last half-hour back in civilization is intermittently entertaining. Even then the pseudo-environmentalism of the conclusion is hard to take. From what weve seen human kindness wont solve the dinosaur problem on that island. Whats clearly called for is a nice fat neutron bomb.

"Lost World The Jurassic Park 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lost-world-the-jurassic-park-2 ) Lost World The Jurassic Park 2 (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli When Jurassic Park was released in 1993 it set a new standard for state-of-the-art visual and audio effects. It was suddenly possible to see humans and dinosaurs interacting in a way that had never before been possible and to feel the entire theater shake with the approach of a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Four years later not a whole lot has changed. Effects houses like Industrial Lights and Magic have tackled bigger more imposing objects such as tornadoes and volcanoes but its still basically the same technology that Jurassic Park ushered in. And because The Lost World doesnt offer anything especially innovative it seems rather familiar and almost (but not quite) disappointing. Like its predecessor The Lost World is basically a big-budget monster movie of the sort that has been popular ever since the dawn of motion pictures. Unfortunately like many entries into the genre it falls into expected patterns. As a result much of this movie seems like a retread of Jurassic Park (with a little King Kong thrown in at the end) not because director Steven Spielberg is intentionally copying himself but because theres really not much more that he can do with the premise. If theres a third movie in the series it will probably follow pretty much the same storyline as the first and second installments. Still repetitiveness notwithstanding The Lost World boasts several edge-of-the-seat moments. The dinosaurs arent nearly as awe-inspiring but they remain formidable adversaries for a group of plucky overmatched humans. The standout sequence in this film features two T-Rexs a lot of rain spiderweb fissures in glass and a literal cliffhanger. The ending which takes place in San Diego rather than on a tropical island (where most of the film transpires) is a little anticlimactic. Next years Godzilla will hopefully do a more impressive job with the ""dinosaur loose in a city"" concept. Returning from the first film is Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm a mathematician with an analytical mind and a wry sense of humor. This time he has an adolescent daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) and a paleontologist girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore). Ian gets pulled back into the dinosaur game when Sarah joins an expedition to the island of Isla Sorna which is populated by a wide variety of genetically-engineered extinct species. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) older and wiser after his Jurassic Park experience no longer intends to open an amusement park; he simply wants to study dinosaurs in a natural environment. So a reluctant Ian along with Sarah a nature photographer named Nick Van Owen (Vince Vaughn) and a gadgets expert Eddie Carr (Richard Schiff) begins a ""look-but-dont-touch"" foray. Little do they know however that Hammonds nephew (Arliss Howard) is on his way to the island with far less benevolent intentions. He wants to bring dinosaurs back to San Diego for a prehistoric zoo. Accompanying him is big game hunter Roland Tembo (Pete Postlethwaite) whose goal is to bag a male T-Rex. The differences between Jurassic Park and The Lost World can be summed up relatively simply more dinosaurs fewer legitimate thrills. In this case familiarity doesnt breed contempt but it results in a movie thats unlikely to keep viewers going back time-after-time the way they did for the original. The Lost World is solid entertainment the first time; its not something I have any great desire to sit through again. One could argue that giving Ian a daughter and a girlfriend is an attempt to broaden his character. If so it really doesnt work. The self-deprecating scientist is likable exclusively because of Jeff Goldblum; even after two films hes still relatively one-dimensional. The rest of the characters are pretty much interchangeable from their counterparts in Jurassic Park (different names; similar functions). Vanessa Lee Chester is this films child in danger; Julianne Moore replaces Laura Dern; and Swingers Vince Vaughn takes over for Sam Neill. Meanwhile Arliss Howard represents the obligatory nasty corporate villain type. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about The Lost World is how perfunctory and unimaginative Steven Spielbergs direction often is. In his more than two decades of film making Spielberg has been responsible for a variety of innovative action/adventure movies -- Jaws Raiders of the Lost Ark and Jurassic Park to name a few. On this occasion he seems content to turn things over to the gurus at ILM. The magical spark that characterizes so many Spielberg films is largely absent. The Lost World ends up being what a British acquaintance of mine calls ""a jolly good romp."" It is to this year what Independence Day was to last year -- the summers single ""cant miss"" motion picture (or so the advertisers would have us believe). It also comes early enough in the season so that were not already sick to death of this kind of effects-oriented action/adventure. So although The Lost World has its share of problems chief of which is the familiarity factor it still offers a couple hours of glitzy hi-tech fun. And thats just about all that anyone can reasonably expect from this kind of blockbuster.

The Lost World Jurassic Park Movie Review (1997) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-lost-world-jurassic-park-1997,200,thelostworldjurassicpark8,thelostworldjurassicpark,rogerebert
The Lost World Jurassic Park May 23 1997 The Lost World Jurassic Park By STEPHEN HOLDEN t isnt the giant carnivorous dinosaurs thundering through the jungle and pulling people apart like spaghetti that provide the scariest chills in The Lost World Jurassic Park. It is their adorable miniature relatives known as compies (Procompsognathus triassicus) who scamper through the underbrush like a gang of famished street urchins playing cute bloodthirsty games of hide-and-seek and follow-the-leader with their prey. In the films stunningly creepy opening scene a young girl wanders away from a British yachting party picnicking on the misty beach of a remote jungle island off the coast of Costa Rica. As she peers into the fringe of the forest a bony little creature skitters out of the woods and gives her a pleading look. No sooner has she allowed her strange new friend to nibble on her roast beef sandwich than it is joined by a crowd of companions chattering and leaping around her their sharp-toothed mouths gaping for treats. We dont see their attack; we only hear her as she screams. It is not the last time these squeally leapfrogging little predators swarm over a vulnerable human figure. Nobody is more adept than Steven Spielberg who directed this sequel to the 900-million-grossing Jurassic Park at teasing a movie audience by finding the grotesque in the cute and the cute in the grotesque. E.T.s ugliness made him more plaintively lovable but it also kept him slightly scary. The Lost World unlike Jurassic Park humanizes its monsters in a way that E.T. would understand. Two of the movies most destructive creatures are a mommy and daddy Tyrannosaurus rex who want only to rescue their child from human captivity. But the new movies endowing of its prehistoric monsters with feelings cuts both ways. While it yields some emotional dividends it compromises the original films notion of an unbridgeable mystical gap between the modern world and Earth as it existed 65 million years ago. The Lost World which like its predecessor has a screenplay adapted by David Koepp from a novel by Michael Crichton (much more loosely adapted in the case of the sequel) involves many of the same hands but it has an entirely different atmosphere. Where the original film was a cut-and-dried Pop-Art-flavored allegory pitting scientific hubris against the unpredictable ungovernable forces of nature the sequel is an all-stops-pulled edge-of-your-seat adventure film whose messages are not so neatly packaged. Where Jurassic Park could be seen as Mr. Spielbergs follow-up to Jaws The Lost World feels more like a variant of the Indiana Jones series lightly seasoned with E.T. The exotic fauna inhabiting the new film are noticeably more versatile and lifelike than those in Jurassic Park and there are many more moments when the lines between computer imaging and reality are all but erased. The scenes of the creatures leaping charging and flapping while emitting eerie shrieking roars are triumphs of technological ingenuity that set new standards in movie special effects. But The Lost World while terrifically entertaining is also structurally out of kilter. Shortly after the two-thirds point the movie comes to a complete halt. And once it revs up its engines again it never regains full power. The first hunk of the movie is a rip-roaring chase-crammed safari adventure that peaks with one of the most suspenseful cliffhanging sequences ever filmed. In this scene Julianne Moore who over the course of the movie survives more perils than Pauline narrowly escapes death in a dinosaur-menaced trailer that dangles over a precipice during a drenching cloudburst. In its second smaller hunk the movie turns into a more conventional echo of Godzilla as a giant Tyrannosaurus rex captured and transported by boat to San Diego runs wild in the comfy suburbs of extreme Southern California. If this dinosaurs-arrive-on-our-shores postscript has its amusing moments (in a clever nod to E.T. a wide-eyed little boy wakes up to see a dinosaur leering into his bedroom window then rushes to tell his disbelieving parents) it is a letdown compared with what came before. The spectacle of a monster stomping through a modern city and batting around buses and chewing on traffic lights has lost enough of its novelty to seem redundant even in hands as masterly as Mr. Spielbergs. Like Jurassic Park The Lost World is much better at pop myth-making and spectacle than it is at character or plot development. Propelled by an elaborate fuzzily elucidated good guys versus bad guys scenario it carries a stronger ecological message than Jurassic Park. At the center of the movie looking more ominously owl-like than ever is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm the skeptical chaos-theory expert who was a minor character in the earlier film. Here he and his fearless girlfriend Sarah (Ms. Moore) a paleontologist studying nurturing among carnivores represent the voices of reason and compassion in a world gone mad with greed. The chief villain is Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard) the rapacious nerdy nephew of Jurassic Parks eccentric mastermind John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) who reappears briefly and ineffectually. Peter is determined to resurrect his uncles nearly bankrupt corporation by exploiting the dinosaurs that were secretly bred on an island not far from the site of the original Jurassic Park. His master plan involves creating a prehistoric zoo in San Diego. Ian who after his Jurassic Park experience had vowed to give dinosaurs a wide berth is reluctantly drawn back to the area when he learns that Sarah is already there conducting research and he is determined to bring her back safely. His rescue operation turns into a survival battle when he and an adolescent stowaway his daughter Kelly (Vanessa Lee Chester) are stranded after the wildlife starts acting up. The trouble begins when Peters zoological army descends from a fleet of helicopters and sets about capturing specimens. The evilest of the new arrivals is a sadistic hunter named Dieter (Peter Stormare) who amuses himself by torturing cornered dinosaurs with an electric cattle prod. The movie is kinder to Roland (Pete Postlethwaite) a seasoned big-game hunter who dreams of bagging a single Tyrannosaurus rex but who also has a healthy respect for wildlife. The Lost World never takes itself too seriously. Yes it can be seen as a fiendish millennial fantasy of our prehistoric past catching up with us. But it also doesnt pretend to be much more than a messy full-blooded adventure yarn with cardboard characters and a story that doesnt track. It winkingly acknowledges as much in a throwaway moment when the escaped Tyrannosaurus rex is shown rampaging through a video store. On one wall is a gaudy poster for a nonexistent movie of King Lear starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Lost World knows its coming from roughly the same place. The Lost World Jurassic Park is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Although the actual gore is minimal it is scarier than Jurassic Park the body count is higher and the overall mood dark. Young children are likely to be terrified.
