Yet it is undeniably tougher more ambitious and less tongue-in-cheek stealing its nightmarish tone and anti-heroic stance from movies such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch. But Zombies glorification of the feral Firefly familys murderous cross-country rampage is undermined by a myopic adolescent amorality he sees them as symbols of a rebellious individualist American spirit.  It doesnt help that the brutalising redneck trio - clown-faced pater familias Captain Spaulding son Otis and daughter Baby - are played by bad actors Sid Haig Bill Moseley and Zombies wife Sheri Moon. All three are eclipsed by veteran genre favourites Geoffrey Lewis Ken Foree and William Forsythe the last of whom plays a sheriff unhinged by his lust for Old Testament-style vengeance. This is the kind of unedifying spectacle likely to appeal to brain-dead sickos who think Charles Manson was a misunderstood messiah rather than a degenerate manipulative psychopath.

"Rob Zombies Devils Rejects Oh the Horror The Horror washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Rob Zombies Devils Rejects Oh the Horror The Horror Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) go on a murderous and pointless rampage in ""Devils Rejects."" (Photos By Gene Page -- Lions Gate Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 22 2005 To Department of Homeland Security From S. Hunter armed citizen and patriot As you have requested I report suspicious activity to 800-492-TIPS. I am more than willing to do my duty. Therefore I inform you of a motion picture titled ""The Devils Rejects."" Sirs if this doesnt qualify as ""suspicious activity"" I dont know what would This film the chronicle of a depraved southwestern family called Firefly is replete with violence gore sadism cool guns greasy hair sexual innuendo a law officer of compromised morality more energy than a hydroelectric dam and the devil music rock-and-roll played so loudly it takes your soul. Why it even features a segment in which a banjo-playing country and western group is massacred As I understand it the film is the progeny of another suspicious document called ""House of 1000 Corpses"" as written and directed by a musician named Rob Zombie with an imagination for miscreants mutants mutiny and mutilation. It is uncertain whether this man is an actual zombie or whether the name is mere affectation; further investigation should be made. As Zombie has it the law has at last closed in on the Firefly clan headquartered in a shabby farmhouse decorated in a style that might be called Classical Honeycomb hanks of hair and pieces of bone. For fun and excitement they murder people. Why? No reason is ever given no motive suggested no psychology implied. The raid is led by Sheriff Wydell played by longtime motion picture personality William Forsythe the pictures Ahab with a six-gun. Its a fairly impressive piece of mayhem with lots of guns going off lots of people falling and dying lots of blur and dust and the upshot is that two of the Fireflys -- Otis (Bill Moseley) and Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie -- theres that last name again) -- escape and soon link up with Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) a third member of the clan and begin a murderous pointless rampage. Meanwhile one Firefly the queen bee of the brood is captured. This unfortunate is played by Leslie Easterbrook of the ""Police Academy"" stories who probably ruined her chances at a big Hollywood career by continued attendance at the Charlton Heston Hollywood Celebrity Shoot a hootenanny put on by the NRA. Not a good career move. However she seems to be the only one in ""The Devils Rejects"" who is actually acting as opposed to camping vamping posing and declaiming and shes very very good Shes very scary. In any event the movie turns quickly into a somewhat clumsily handled chase structure with no clear point or end. It would help I think if the Fireflys had some career goal in mind They were robbers they were trying to get somewhere by a certain time. As it is they seem to merely be hobbyists pursuing their avocation merrily without any sense of direction. In perhaps inevitable ways it evolves that the true villain is the sheriff because he puts moral vanity ahead of professionalism and pines to punish the Fireflys out of vengeance rather than justice. Forsythe has always been an intense presence in films and one cant watch his work here without wondering why he never got bigger as he seemed poised on the brink of That Big Role particularly after ""Once Upon a Time in America"" in 1984. Instead . . . smaller roles in smaller and smaller movies. The movies signal flaw -- that is other than its degeneracy its sloppiness its love of dark things and pretty stains and arterial spray patterns -- is Moseley as the demonic Otis. He seems rather ordinary. I mean if youre going to do this sort of thing then you should do it boldly proudly loudly prancingly. Moseley somehow comes up a few bricks shy in ye olde charisma department and thus his frequent atrocities lack the evil frisson they should demonstrate. Meanwhile Haig is excellent as Captain Spaulding -- the names for all PhD candidates and such are derived from the canon of the Marx Brothers -- who is represented as a rodeo clown with the appetites of a maniac. Loved the wonderful touch of his chalked-white face in contrast to his rancid yellow teeth bared too frequently in his leering smirky grins. He is a one-man insane clown posse. What is most suspicious about the movie dear sirs is its somewhat sloppy grip on its central conceit which is the life force the charisma the charm of its renegade trio. They are what they are as opposed to Sheriff Wydell who commits the bigger sin (according to the Zombie moral order) of being a hypocrite. Now if thats not suspicious what is? As a great man once said Watch the skies The Devils Rejects (101 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme violence sexual innuendo and aggression.

Directed and written by Rob Zombie. 101 minutes. Rated R for sadistic violence strong sexual content language and drug use. Several theaters. Say this much for gonzo-rocker-turned-horror-director Rob Zombie The guy wouldnt know shame if it kicked him in the groin with steel-toed boots. Theres something refreshingly brazen about Zombies embrace of the 70s horror aesthetic. He honors ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and other films with an unapologetic pursuit of gruesome extremes. With his cult-hit debut ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and now his spinoff second film ""The Devils Rejects"" Zombie has established brand-name credentials as a connoisseur of carnage. Both films suffer from paper-thin plots and cardboard characters but theres no denying Zombies Tarantino-like zeal for grindhouse depravity. With its 70s B-movie title credits ""The Devils Rejects"" is freak-show fodder for the drive-in from hell best appreciated by hardcore horror buffs and criminal outcasts. The aptly named title characters are the fiendish Firefly family (they take their names from Marx Brothers comedies) a band of serial killers led by Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) the maniacal clown from ""House of 1000 Corpses."" His daughter Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie the directors wife) and son Otis (Bill Moseley) have taken hostages in a fleabag motel after police ambushed their isolated desert homestead and hauled Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) away for interrogation. Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe all sneers and sotto voce sarcasm) seeks revenge for the death of his brother and the body count rises exponentially. Zombie has an obvious fetish for shocking death and torture -- including a nearly naked woman splattered by a speeding tractor-trailer (""Scoop up some o that skull matter for the coroner"" orders the sheriff) -- and that makes ""The Devils Rejects"" a morbid ordeal like a white-trash episode of ""Cops"" gone horribly awry. Despite some giddy humor and a soundtrack of 70s Top-40 hits this is ""entertainment"" for sociopaths occasionally effective but impossible to recommend with a clear conscience.

Starring Sid Haig Sheri Moon Bill MoseleyWilliam Forsythe and Danny Trejo. Directed by Rob Zombie. (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) A tough internal struggle must take place before one can come forward and admit enjoying ""The Devils Rejects"" a movie so fundamentally horrible that even its creator has to admit hes basically made a 101-minute snuff film. But Rob Zombies sequel to ""House of 1000 Corpses"" is not a bad movie and the director has made more progress from his last exercise in gratuitous carnage than anyone could hope for. After a decent first 10 minutes the stunningly violent ""House"" was a complete waste. In Zombies new film the first 15 minutes and last half hour are terrific and the stunningly violent middle part is only a partial waste. The third paragraph is as far as we should go before pointing out that there is an unusual amount of torture of the undeserving in this film and even well-adjusted children who balance their own checkbooks and watch ""The Sopranos"" on HBO should avoid it. ""The Devils Rejects"" has a small fraction of the body count of its predecessor (call it ""House of 15 or 20 Corpses"") but still manages an equal amount of gore. ""Rejects"" avoided an NC-17 rating but that doesnt mean it doesnt deserve one and its unlikely that there will be a more violent film in the multiplexes this year. Still not sure if you should let your 13-year-old see it? On an inappropriate movie scale of 1 to 10 where the R-rated ""Wedding Crashers"" rates a 7 ""The Devils Rejects"" gets about a 194. The film opens with a naked bruised woman being dragged through the forest by a guy with burn scars for a face -- and thats one of the easier scenes to watch. Some dude in front of me brought what looked like a 3-year-old boy to the critics screening and the 30 he saved on a baby sitter will one day cost 30000 in therapy bills. The mayhem in ""The Devils Rejects"" begins where ""House of 1000 Corpses"" left off with a family of serial killers holed up in a ranch house and a bunch of backwoods cops outside. Leading the law enforcement is Sheriff Wydell played by the underrated William Forsythe as a perfect combination of the Harvey Keitel character in ""Bad Lieutenant"" and the principal in ""The Breakfast Club."" The killers are sort of a homicidal ""Dukes of Hazzard"" clan including smart-mouthed son Otis (Bill Moseley) hottie-in-short-shorts Baby (Sheri Moon) and demented grandfather figure Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) a repulsive bad ol boy prone to clown makeup atrocious hygiene and creative murders. Victims arent just killed in ""The Devils Rejects"" -- theyre tortured forced to torture other victims teased a little and then tortured some more. The inevitable slaughter is usually a relief. But even though Zombie appears to be using his directorial powers for evil hes really taking the hard way out. The horrors onscreen distract from the fact that his dialogue is very clever and his filmmaking is never boring. The director constantly changes the rules freezing frames or playing with the lighting to jolt viewers back into the film. While other modern horror directors paint by the numbers Zombie uses his camera to create the feeling that youre on a carnival ride that wont stop. As with ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and other 70s slashers this filmmaker loves the audience becomes part of the torture. In a good way. Sort of. Zombies music was always interesting and its no surprise that sound plays a large and effective part in his movies. The scenes of maximum mayhem are accompanied only by popular songs from the 1970s -- Zombies ""Midnight Rider"" interlude has to be the best use of the song since ""The Electric Horseman."" The director is good at capturing the moment but he once again fails to grasp the big picture treating each scene so lovingly that the movie suffers. This is a land where the killers are stupid and the cops are stupider. (The getaway car has the names of the people Baby and Otis just killed printed on the sides but the handful of bumbling county sheriffs still have trouble catching up.) The freeze-frame-happy Zombie creates a very interesting visual style but it gets in the way of his story. Take out the slow motion in ""The Devils Rejects"" and its a 20-minute film. When the film split during the final reel many at the screening assumed it was part of Zombies cinematic plan. There seemed to be a sense of relief during the five minutes it took to fix the problem but also a horrifying realization that everyone wanted to see the films last 15 minutes. At that point people must have been offended by the movie. But no one walked out. -- Advisory Oh geez where to start. ...

"Devils Rejects The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; devil-s-rejects-the ) Devils Rejects The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli When a movie is this bad its hard to adequately describe its awfulness in words. The temptation exists to write something along the lines of ""Something this horrible has to be seen to be believed."" Of course that kind of advice would lead to e-mail death threats and other assorted nasty comments from those who spend money on The Devils Rejects. And Im sure AMC wont be making the same rebate offer they made for Cinderella Man. The reason is understandable about 95% of their customers would be demanding their money back. As for the other 5%... it is said that Rob Zombie is an acquired taste (as his awful debut House of 1000 Corpses indicated). If thats the case then I hope its not contagious and I dont become infected. This is a vile and reprehensible motion picture. Critic Scott Weinberg with whom I endured the screening made the following comment when it was over ""I have to go home and take a shower to wash away the filth."" Amen. What occurs on screen is more formula than plot. The verses are a little different but the refrain is always the same a bloody conflict that results in multiple deaths and/or maimings. There are three categories of people in the movie the killers the gung-ho lawmen and the victims. In the first camp are Captain Spaulding the clown (Sid Haig); his daughter Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) and son Otis (Bill Moseley); and their mother (Leslie Easterbrook). In the second is Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) who crosses the line from law enforcement to vigilantism. And in the third are the unfortunates Roy (Geoffrey Lewis) Gloria (Priscilla Barnes) and a bunch of others. The Devils Rejects has the killers methodically slaughtering the victims while the law closes in. Once theres no one left to butcher it becomes killers against the lawmen. Every character is repugnant yet writer/director Zombies sympathies seem to lie with the killers - a group whose abominations make the Manson Familys acts appear tame. Zombie views Captain Spaulding and his group like a Bonnie and Clyde or Butch and Sundance yet theres not a human characteristic in any of them. Sitting through a movie centered on these individuals becomes a chore. (It takes a director with greater skill than Zombie to keep an audience interested when there isnt a likeable character on screen.) And it doesnt help that the lone ""good guy"" is as unhinged as the ones hes pursuing. It might be possible to feel something about the victims if their life spans werent so short. They are on hand to be beaten up eviscerated shot and/or filleted. Zombies goal is to pay homage to a genre that was born (and probably should have died) in the 1970s outcasts who defy society by destroying it. Of course that sentiment was socially acceptable during a time of cultural upheaval; few will find it to be relevant or engaging today. I doubt however that the writer/director considered this. He was probably intrigued by the gruesomeness and bloodletting. The dialogue is a pastiche (at least I think thats the intention) of the kind of bloodthirsty overripe lines found in this sort of film with clichA(c)s sprinkled in as liberally as profanity. Theres plenty of nudity - nearly every female with more than a token speaking part bares her breasts (or more) - usually just before being gutted like a stuck pig. Zombie has elected to shoot The Devils Rejects as if he was making the movie during the 70s. Cheesy freeze-frames and hand-held shots abound. Its worth noting that most of the directors being emulated were hacks and that pretty much says all that needs to be said about the films look. I suppose on some level Zombie thought he was rousing the spirit of Sam Peckinpah but if that was his intention the ghost continues to sleep. The acting makes the performances in a typical high-school play look impressive. Theres more wood here than in the walls of a log cabin and finding the occasional acceptable instance of acting is like rooting through a pile of turds to discover a chunk of glass. The cast is littered with 70s bit players. Sid Haig was all over the place in the late 1960s and early 1970s but hasnt done much since. Geoffrey Lewis survived the 70s by becoming a character actor. Priscilla Barnes is best-known for being Suzanne Somers replacement on ""Threes Company."" Even P.J. Soles has a small part. Aside from its poor production values horrendous acting and ignoble morality The Devils Rejects isnt engaging cinema. Even if the simple act of sitting in a movie theater watching people get hacked up for 90 minutes doesnt bother you the dullness and repetition is likely to. The ending is a cataclysmic misfire - not only is it drawn out and self-indulgent (cut down on the slow-motion) but it robs viewers of a chance at a catharsis and re-enforces the argument that Zombies lone point was to create mayhem. The Devils Rejects doesnt just deserve to be rejected but to be buried in a hole so dank that no one will discover it. Only there will it be at home.

Its also a whitesploitation classic from its menacing sideburns to its demented laughter. Three backroads demons devote themselves to slaughtering everything in their path. No explanation is sought or given because were here for killin and lots of it. Elmore Leonards pulp credo AC/a,!aEUR skip the boring parts AC/a,!aEUR is enforced by writer-director Rob Zombie who works with a palette of screaming half- or all-nekkid chicks homicidal maniacs and deranged cops. Plus he treats us to virtually all of ""Freebird."" To get more white-trash than this movie youd have to fix yourself a Fluffernutter and wash it down with Southern Comfort while sitting in the Dodge Charger thats been your lawn ornament for 20 years. Zombie of the metal band White Zombie uses some of the same characters from his uneven previous film ""House of 10000 Corpses"" but this time the dirt is much purer. Quentin Tarantino will wish he had made this one; ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Kill Bill"" are flawed A-movies. This is a perfect B-movie full of wicked dread. Its far scarier than ""Friday the 13th"" and not far short of the industry standard the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" The actors AC/a,!aEUR Sid Haig as an evil clown; Bill Moseley as a chatty nut who looks like the lost Allman Brother; Zombies wife Sheri Moon Zombie as their blond wench Baby; and William Forsythe as the sadistic cop chasing them AC/a,!aEUR expertly convey the cackling freeze-frame-loving soul of the 70s midnight movie. The wit Zombie brings to this horror show AC/a,!aEUR watch for the clowns loony exchange with a roadside chicken merchant AC/a,!aEUR is all the funnier when it bounces off the fourth wall. The sheriff told that the killers have named themselves after Marx Brothers characters seeks further clues by growling ""Get that movie critic over here.""

It is a proudly sick film of no social value whatsoever and all right-thinking moviegoers will properly shun it as a pox upon their multiplex.Everyone else might want to check it out.Steeped deeply and knowledgeably in the trash aesthetic of Roger Corman B-films and Combat Zone grindhouse fare like I Spit on Your Grave"" Devils Rejects"" is a blood-smeared and almost completely scurrilous love letter to anyone who ever appeared in the junk movies of the 60s through 80s. This extends to the casting of anyone who ever appeared in the junk movies of the 60s through 80s.True of the psychotic central trio only Sid Haig as the clown-faced Captain Spaulding has bona fide psychotronic street cred (he costarred in the 1968 cult classic Spider Baby""). Sheri Moon as his pneumatic daughter Baby is better known as Mrs. Rob Zombie and Bill Moseley as their testy Manson-esque partner in crime Otis B. Driftwood has only been around since the late 80s.(Yes theyre named after Groucho Marx characters. Rob Zombie it turns out has a thing for Marx Brothers movies as well and he really loves cheesy mid-70s rock songs such as Elvin Bishops Fooled Around and Fell in Love"" and David Essexs Rock On."" No one has ever combined drive-in sleaze references to classic comedy teams and the oeuvre of Lynyrd Skynyrd before in large part because no one has considered it a remotely good idea.)As the Spauldings tear across the desert with Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe) the designated hellhound on their trail each of their gore-spattered encounters contains a cameo designed to make late-night cable aficionados sit bolt upright in disbelief.

True its refreshing to find a director who doesnt pull punches and ostensibly this is to make us loathe the Captain and his confreres all the more softening us up for the sheriffs climactic vigilante vengeance.But thats just a shell game. Zombie loves his drive-in killers and he wants us to love them too -- theyre uninhibited uber-slobs following their homicidal whims without acknowledging other people as anything besides targets or playthings. Theyre free -- in a cretinous sort of way -- and Devils Rejects"" lets them go out in a blaze of glory that echoes both Bonnie and Clyde"" and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.""Sorry doesnt wash even with Free Bird"" yowling triumphantly on the soundtrack. With The Devils Rejects"" Rob Zombie proves hes a filmmaker to be taken seriously -- or at least not to be considered a total joke -- but he still hasnt figured out how to fashion something more than the sum of his enthusiasms.

Thats pretty close to the tone of writer/director Rob Zombies The Devils Rejects. Everyone having a good time? Sid Haig and Bill Moseley are road-tripping killers in Rob Zombies The Devils Rejects. Lions Gate Films This ""road"" sequel to Mr. Zombies more interior House of 1000 Corpses (2003) marks the return of Sid Haigs Captain Spaulding character who looks like one of those guys you see in dentist-office publications warning about gum disease. Along with a blond daughter in tattered cut-offs (Sheri Moon Zombie) and a son who apparently gets his hair done at Manson Cuts (Bill Moseley) he is responsible for enough serial killings to well fill a house. (Related video Watch the Devils Rejects trailer) About the movie The Devils Rejects   Stars Sid Haig Sheri Moon Zombie Rob Moseley William Forsythe Geoffrey Lewis Priscilla Barnes Director Rob Zombie Distributor Lions Gate Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Rated R for sadistic violence strong sexual content language and drug use Opens Friday nationwide This inflames the law (William Forsythe) who to crack his case hires an obnoxious film prof whos all too aware that the real Spaulding was played by Groucho Marx in Animal Crackers. The movie is full of these winks which are supposed to make Zombies sometimes-stylish carnage palatable. The movie even tosses in a fantasy sex sequence between Haig and onetime porn queen Ginger Lynn Allen. A little of this will go a long way and besides who wants to see someone torturing Threes Companys Priscilla Barnes in a roach motel? Some people do obviously or there wouldnt be this sequel. For all its ugliness Rejects is fairly tight. Zombies perceived panache enabled him to break bread last week on an IFC Channel Dinner for Five rerun -- across the table from Roger Corman no less. Thats because this movie is hardly the worst of its drive-in ilk even if it is tough to get over that ptomaine aftertaste.

"Giving the Devil Its Due washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Giving the Devil Its Due The family that slays together Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) and Otis (Bill Moseley) in ""The Devils Rejects."" (By Gene Page) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 22 2005 MEET THE Firefly family a southern fried version of Charles Mansons murderous clan that kills people with giddy abandon as its members trade endless graphic obscenities. In ""The Devils Rejects"" Rob Zombies follow-up to the gruesome ""House of 1000 Corpses"" these gleeful psychotics find themselves on the run. It seems Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) is all bent out of shape because his brother was one of the Fireflys 1000-plus victims. So he has set up camp outside their farmhouse with a small force of Texas Rangers ordering the family to surrender. Well you can imagine what the Fireflys have to say about that. One bloody shootout and conflagration later Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook) is caught and arrested and Otis Firefly (Bill Moseley) and his sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie) are burning rubber and hitting the old blacktop. Busting into a motel room they torment and massacre a few more innocents while they wait for their father Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) to join them. All in a days work ya know? Captain Spaulding incidentally is made up like a clown from hell. And he never met a passerby he didnt like to terrify and slaughter. Finally all together the Fireflys take refuge in a dilapidated amusement park run by Captain Spauldings half-brother Charlie Altamont (Ken Foree). But the demented sheriff is always moments away. Things aint gonna end up good thats for sure. But you know the cackling nihilistic Fireflys are going to enjoy every minute. Abandon hope all who enter this movie thinking its supposed to mean anything or redeem itself. But thats the point of ""Rejects"" which is a sentimental (if thats the right word) return to the cold-slab murderousness of such flicks as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the anything-goes mayhem of midnight movies in general. For the right audience this movie is the butt-kicking dirt-talking blood-spurting equivalent of beautiful music. Speaking of which the soundtrack is a stomping kick of its own with songs from Joe Walsh the Allman Brothers and other hard-drivers. One climactic scene uses Lynyrd Skynyrds ""Free Bird"" to invoke the collective spirit of Sam Peckinpah Butch amp; Sundance and Thelma amp; Louise for a death-or-glory shoot-em-up with the cops. Love him or hate him you have to hand it to writer-director Zombie whos a midnight movie unto himself with his dreadlocks his fascination for Manson and the Marx brothers and his former life as lead singer for the metal band White Zombie. He never wavers from his purist task of shocking (or thrilling) viewers down to their hard-core boots. THE DEVILS REJECTS (R 101 minutes) -- Contains gruesome violence pervasive obscenity drug use and nudity. Area theaters.

In The Devils Rejects Zombies second effort as a grade-Z-and-lovin-it auteur (the first was 2003s House of 1000 Corpses) he directs like someone who has spent far too much time soaking up the most psychotic images of violence he can find Chainsaw (natch) and Cannibal Holocaust Manson docs and Faces of Death videos Natural Born Killers and I Spit on Your Grave. The Devils Rejects a wild-ass road movie of down-home slaughter recalls many other tales of homicidal sadists in the rocky American Southwest. The difference is that Zombie doesnt pretend to be on the side of the victims. He makes no bones about his identification with the sexy outlaw serial killers a brother and sister played by the hippieish Bill Moseley and the Marilyn Chambers-like Sheri Moon Zombie (the directors wife) who commit many squalid and hideous acts terrorizing their victims with knives axes and shotguns all in the name of sociopathic cool. Theyre the movies ""rock stars"" incarnate. Zombies characters are to put it mildly undeveloped (he features two kinds of women sexy young sluts and beat-up old whores) but theres no denying the leeringly grotesque egghead-devil charisma of Sid Haig who returns from House of 1000 Corpses as Captain Spaulding the clown so ugly you forgot to laugh.

Recycling the trio of butchers from his 2003 surprise hit ""House of 1000 Corpses"" pic is a brutal punishing yet mordantly amusing work that far outpaces its predecessor in its grisly single-mindedness of vision. Heavy-metal rocker-turned-cult filmmaker Rob Zombie has fashioned another bloody grind house valentine in ""The Devils Rejects."" Recycling the trio of butchers from his 2003 surprise hit ""House of 1000 Corpses"" pic is a brutal punishing yet mordantly amusing work that far outpaces its predecessor in its grisly single-mindedness of vision. If you can stomach the violence -- and despite the R rating thats a big if -- its hard to deny that Zombie has made exactly the movie he set out to make guaranteed to satiate his considerable fan base and sicken just about everyone else. Where ""House"" came across as little more than a ghoulish curio set in an outre Texas deathtrap and steeped in arcane serial-killer mythology ""Rejects"" takes a less self-conscious romp through 1970s backwoods Alabama. Shot on desaturated Super-16 stock that gives it a fittingly rough-hewn look this is lean mean exploitation fare that proceeds with a menacing clarity of purpose. That homicidal brother-sister duo -- Otis Driftwood (chillingly stoic Bill Moseley) and impish blond Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie the scribe-directors wife) -- is back as well as Mother Firefly (albeit played by a new actress the spectacularly screechy Leslie Easterbrook). Wanted for a horrific series of satanic ritual murders involving organs and refrigerators the family is ambushed by police in pics tense opening shootout which sends Otis and Baby on the run while Mother Firefly winds up in police custody. The siblings eventually reunite with wayward pop Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig) a grinning clown-faced sadist whose mugging in ""House"" suggested a cross between P.T. Barnum and Ed Gein. (Clown-phobic auds should by and large avoid Zombies movies.) Meanwhile the police operation tracking them down is headed by Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe) who has his own personal agenda His brother was one of the familys victims. Transplanting the action to the road turns out to be Zombies most inspired decision excavating the film from the hoary funhouse cliches that bogged down its predecessor. It also lends a genuinely sad unpredictability to the quintet of innocents Captain Spaulding Otis and Baby eventually terrorize While the idiot thrill-seekers who stumbled into ""House"" more or less asked for their fate the group here is simply in the wrong place (a rundown motel) at the wrong time. What follows is at once the films most gratuitous objectionable sequence and its gripping raison detre The victims holed up in a motel room are dispatched in all kinds of sickeningly creative ways the most inventive (and hilarious to judge by the howling applause at premiere screening) involving a mask made from a human face and a giant truck. The women in particular Gloria (Priscilla Barnes) and Wendy (Kate Norby) are forcibly disrobed and reduced to the cruelest of physical spectacles. On a basic narrative level sequence serves no purpose other than to supply the requisite sadistic kicks and it will be the likely walkout point for moviegoers not on Zombies particularly heartless wavelength. Those who stick around will find the story shifting gears and losing some momentum as the increasingly unhinged Sheriff Wydell fancying himself the smiting hand of God decides to take vengeance into his own hands. Hes aided in this by two bounty hunters (Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page) and an unwilling accomplice in the form of Captain Spauldings old pal Charlie (a solid Ken Foree). The violent climax could amount to a critique of vigilante justice if pic did not take such obvious relish (which auds may very well share) at the sight of its predators turned into prey. What rescues ""Rejects"" from puerility aside from the indelibly raw perfs (especially from Moseley and Forsythe) is the sharp undistracted focus of Zombies direction. Every scene feels stripped down to its bare bones with deft handheld camerawork and editing by Phil Parmet and Glenn Garland respectively (although print screened featured a few unintended jump cuts that will be removed before theatrical release). The tasty soundtrack is pure 70s heaven -- not a word that can applied to this film in any other context -- and makes memorably ironic use of Lynyrd Skynyrds ""Free Bird.""
