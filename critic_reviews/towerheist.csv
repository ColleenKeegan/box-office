As mainstream Hollywood studio movies go Tower Heist isnt bad and it will probably fulfill most audiences desire for escapist fare. But despite some good laughs here and there and a couple of neat plot twists its just not as clever as it seems to think it is. Even a recurring cat-and-mouse exchange about chess between the bad guy (billionaire-investor Alan Alda) and the good guy (Robin Hood-ish thief Ben Stiller) doesnt pay off with a really satisfying punchline. On the plus side Tower Heist has a well-cast ensemble and makes great use of its mid-Manhattan location including an incursion into the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. (I was more absorbed in those scenes--and trying to figure out how they were filmed--than I was in the ""thrill"" footage set many stories up in the sky. Now that computer imagery has made the impossible possible its hard to be invested in those kind of stunts because we know-- --theyre not real and no one is at risk.) Ben Stiller is right at home in the role of a hard-working multi-tasking building manager for the swankiest apartment house in New York City. Alda is his highest-profile tenant who turns out to be a swindler. When it turns out that hes pilfered the pension funds of the building staff Stiller recruits a handful of allies to break into Aldas apartment and find his hidden safe. His secret ingredient a thief he knows from his neighborhood in Queens. Eddie Murphy is a natural for this role which should have been the comic showcase some of us have been waiting for. Instead hes on cruise control as if to acknowledge that with material like this it isnt worth breaking a sweat. Director Brett Ratner does capture the atmosphere of a bustling New York building with a multicultural staff. But the script credited to Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson (from a story by Adam Cooper Bill Collage and Griffin) never goes the distance in terms of interesting character development...and leaves several story threads loose during the third act. I know its just a caper movie. But why shouldnt a big-budget film with A-list talent provide a great entertainment experience? Tower Heist is just good enough to get by.

I agree it is great to see Eddie Murphy back on the Hollywood scene. Sickwititsaid on Saturday February 18 2012 102108 AMThis movie was great for what it was its not suppose to have a lot of intellectual pressence to it its suppose to be goofy and no it doesnt compare to oceans 11 but it hits home with normal life situations especially how the rich are getting richer and everyone else is just working their ass off everyday but still dont feel like you got anything in the end bottom line people expect way to much from movies but if you can do it so much better then make one Robsaid on Sunday November 20 2011 33807 PMI cant totally disagree with him since he opened with ""it will probably score fairly high with audiences just looking for some fun escapism."" And thats me. But my tastes are not just totally pedestrian. Having said that I disagree with him and it was the most entertaining film I had seen in quite a while. I go to to many movies with great reviews and leave not having had a great time. This time I did and I laughed a lot. Greg Vachonsaid on Sunday November 20 2011 83102 AMC minus for sure. Its complete idiocy (huge plot holes) that is a big fat F if not for great actors giving it just a bit of substance. I wish I hadnt wasted even the time seeing it. hh423said on Thursday November 03 2011 72526 PMDisagree big time great film enjoyed it a lot.

Both specialize in frat-boy-oriented movies full of noise explosions and references to testicles. But while Bay wants to make GIGANTIC movies that often wind up being awful Ratner just wants to make BIG movies that usually end up mediocre. If you have a lot of resources but maybe not a ton of talent Ratners path might is the one to take. People will tend to ignore your films rather than hate them and every now and then youll come up with something modestly enjoyable like Tower Heist. Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy are billed as the stars but dont be misled Stiller has the lead role followed by an ensemble that includes Murphy. Stiller plays Josh Kovacs the dedicated building manager of a luxury Manhattan apartment building called the Tower (modeled after Trump Tower where the exteriors were filmed) home to wealthy people who rely on people like Josh to open doors for them run their errands and bring them room service. The residents are friendly to ""the help"" though one should not mistake them for actual friends. In the penthouse is Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) a congenial Wall Street type who it turns out is also a Bernie Madoff type being investigated for securities fraud. Among the people he allegedly bilked are Josh and the other Tower employees as a favor to the Tower Shaw had agreed to handle their pension funds. Now Shaw is under house arrest his penthouse treated like a prison guarded by FBI agents while the agent in charge of the case Claire Denham (Tea Leoni) tries to figure out where all the money went. Josh thinks a significant chunk of it might be hidden in Shaws apartment so to reclaim what is rightfully theirs he and some of his fellow Tower employees plan a heist. Nobody knows the buildings nooks and crannies and lapses in security like they do. As Josh puts it ""Weve been casing the place for a decade we just didnt know it"" Among his cohorts are the buildings concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck) whos also his brother-in-law; Enrique (Michael Pena) the new elevator operator; Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe) the maid; and a resident Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) who worked for Merrill Lynch up until the crash and is now penniless. Since none of them have ever committed a burglary before they enlist the aid of Slide (Eddie Murphy) a petty criminal from Joshs neighborhood. Looking at the skeleton of the story you must admit its not a bad idea for an action comedy and though the movie has been in various stages of development since 2005 it couldnt have been released at a better time than now when anger toward the unscrupulous segment of the 1 percent is at a fever pitch. Leave it to a goofball like Ratner to accidentally stumble into relevance. Not that the movie has a lot of Big Ideas to express of course; its a story about scrappy underdogs getting revenge first a commentary on our current economic woes second (maybe even third). Stiller Affleck Broderick and Pena have a lively rapport alternating between fussing over the Oceans Eleven-ish details of the heist and being afraid of it. Tea Leoni has some funny moments as the FBI agent including a fine bit of drunkenness. Sidibe in her first role since the astonishing Precious gets to have some fun for once though the less said about her Jamaican accent the better. And what about Eddie Murphy? There are a few scenes where his fast-talking hoodlum character is funny sharp and interesting enough that you think ""Wow Eddie Murphy is back"" The story doesnt give Slide enough of the focus to allow Murphy to really stretch his atrophied comedy muscles -- the character basically becomes expendable -- but its a relief just to get a taste of the old magic again. All of this being said we cant overlook the many many things wrong with the film most of which probably stem from its convoluted path into production. Written first by Adam Cooper and Bill Collage reworked by almost a dozen others and ultimately credited to Ted Griffin (Best Laid Plans) and Ratner regular Jeff Nathanson the screenplay bears all the scars and bruises that such a process would suggest. You can see the remnants of discarded plot devices. The fact that Josh Slide and Shaw all grew up in Astoria Queens is mentioned as if something is being set up but theres no pay off. A romance between Josh and the FBI agent is hinted at and disregarded. There are clearly scenes missing like the one that would have explained how a particular ruse involving a rescheduled court date was perpetrated. Thats not to mention the huge holes in the details of the story the things that just dont make sense or are literally impossible. Without giving anything away Im talking about heavy things that must be moved and which are surely much heavier than the movie would have us believe and whose very existence opens a whole new range of questions. The movie goes through the paces of a twisty heist caper often letting us think something has gone awry only to reveal it was all part of the plan. What it misses though is the part where it goes back and explains how it was part of the plan and how Thing X got moved to Location Y while the cops were chasing Person Z. Ill go ahead and blame Ratner for that just because. But I also have to give him credit for overseeing a film that made me laugh and held my interest more than it should have given how sloppy it is. Call it an acceptable bit of B- work from a C student.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 4 2011 Save for later Saved From left Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy Matthew Broderick and Gabourey Sidibe are shown in a scene from the film Tower Heist. David Lee/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The so-so ""Tower Heist"" is a caper comedy for our times. Employees of a fancy Manhattan high-rise plot to steal back the pension money stolen by its penthouse-occupying Bernie Madoff-style fat cat. Building manager Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) heads up a posse including the concierge (Casey Affleck) doorman (Stephen McKinley Henderson) bellhop (Michael Pena) bankrupt trader resident (Matthew Broderick) and Jamaican maid (""Precious"" star Gabourey Sidibe). Alan Alda plays the billionaire and his oleaginous smarm is so good that you almost wish Alda were starring in a hard-edged movie about Madoff instead of this goofy heist picture that takes way too long getting to the heist.Director and co-writer Brett Ratner also takes an unconscionably long time bringing costar Eddie Murphy playing a two-bit crook named Slide into the fold. Murphy is occasionally at his loudmouth best here; the film could have used a lot more of his street-smart braying. (Reportedly he originally initiated the project as an all-black ""Oceans Eleven"" before it got turned around.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Ratner stages some effective vertigo-inducing scenes atop the high rise but the best sequence is the simplest Slide demands that each of the potential crooks demonstrate their toughness by stealing an item worth at least 50 from the local mall. If this film turns out to be a big success malls everywhere may want to hire more security. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for language and sexual content.)

But its not a bill The camera pulls back to reveal that Ben Franklins visage occupies the middle of a giant swimming pool perched atop a New York skyscraper. Its a fitting opening salvo for a film thats been pitted as Hollywoods grand show of support for the 99 percenters. The pool belongs to Wall Street billionaire Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) a Madoff-like figure who gets arrested for a Madoff-like fraud that evaporates his employees pensions. Those employees include Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) director of operations at Shaws New York City high rise a thinly disguised version of the iconic Trump International Hotel amp; Tower. Soon a revenge plot is hatched with Kovacs con neighbor Slide (Eddie Murphy) enlisted to turn him his brother-in-law (Casey Affleck) a former resident (Matthew Broderick) and a fired employee (Michael Pena) into a capable criminal team. This might be the closest well get to mass entertainment with a conscience This is of course Hollywood schlock directed by shlock-master Brett Ratner (Rush Hour). But its also a surprisingly effective social drama. Ratner keeps the action rooted to the here-and-now offering a recession-times revenge fantasy where the motivations never feel fantastical even if the heist itself does. From the start the movie lays the groundwork for a cathartic payoff. Rather than hurrying into a barrage of plot developments Ratner spends spends considerable time showing the regular-guy protagonists on the job. Coming from diverse backgrounds that reflect the melting pot realities of modern New York theyre seen earning their paychecks by holding doors for the residents cleaning their apartments and making sure that precise individual needs are met. One of the characters studies for the bar exam during her downtime. They ride the subway back to comfortable modest outer-borough apartments. In short these arent archetypes exaggerated for comic effect but rather hard workers earning their ephemeral shot at a small part of the American Dream. The protagonists arent embellished here; the villains and secondary characters though are. Theres the smarmy Shaw owner of one of Steve McQueens hot-red Ferraris whose sympathetic facade turns into haughty indifference when his duplicity is shown to have robbed the employees of their pensions. Scam artist Slide meanwhile is played by Eddie Murphy in all his 80s-style fast-talking glory. The reasoning behind the titual caper is sensible enough These people want their pensions back. And so in contrast to a lot of big-screen heists theres an aura of disbelief surrounding the planning and execution of the robbery and fewer of the usual flashy thrills. With the exception of Slide the characters arent out to get rich or grab an adrenaline high. Though Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) takes a golf club to Shaws prized car the tone is less angry than resigned to the desperate situation. Tower Heist aims effectively for the tear ducts when Josh visits doorman Lester (Stephen McKinley Henderson) in his hospital room after the kindly veteran tries to kill himself when upon learning his savings have vanished. Given the proliferation of stories about lost 401Ks not unlike Lesters its easy to be infected by the urgency that propels Josh on the quest for revenge. Within its generic exterior the film celebrates these sorts of relationships instead of the materialistic ideals so often promoted by Hollywood. Its successful in revealing the human cost of economic malfeasance from the ground up. In its appreciation for the basic dignity and inherent rights of all hard workers the picture comes in the tradition of grand social dramas such as Norma Rae or On the Waterfront.

Stiller is the obsequious manager of a Manhattan luxury hotel who has entrusted his employee pension fund to slimy investment broker and hotel resident Alan Alda; after the latter is charged with securities fraud and the hotel workers discover theyve lost their retirement savings the manager assembles a crew of down-and-outers (Casey Affleck Matthew Broderick Michael Pena Gabourey Sidibe) and recruits two-bit criminal Murphy to help them burglarize Aldas unit for hidden cash.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 04 2011 600AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English An unofficial kick-off of the 2011 holiday movie season Tower Heist is as over-inflated as those Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade balloons that are featured in the movies climax. Also similarly its entertaining in its own predictable way. The latest comedy-action film from director Brad Ratner (the Rush Hour trilogy X-Men The Last Stand) is a shaggy affair but its intermittently inspired in its action sequences and the comic business of its sprawling cast. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new comedy ""Trailer Heist"" starring Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy Movies Tower Heist The official trailer Eddie Murphy attends the world premiere of ""Tower Heist"" at the Ziegfeld Theatre on Oct. 24 2011 in New York City. Getty Images Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? Ben Stiller stars as Josh Kovacs in a role not terribly different from his Night at the Museum character - hes a dedicated subaltern in this case the building manager of a high-end apartment hotel in New York (its shot in the Trump Tower). When Josh discovers that his boss smug Wall Street tycoon Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who lives in the hotels penthouse has swindled the hotel employees out of their pensions he organizes a team of disgruntled hotel workers to break into Shaws suite to steal back their lost money. Josh learns of the swindle when the FBI arrests Shaw. When he confronts his boss he gets fired along with two other employees bumbling concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck) and the recently hired Enrique (Michael Pena). A sympathetic FBI agent (Tea Leoni) tips Josh off that Shaw probably has a substantial emergency fund stashed somewhere. Knowing the building as well as he does Josh guesses where the money may be and decides to organize a team to get into the penthouse now guarded by FBI agents to steal the money back. In addition to his aggrieved hotel pals the conspirators include bankrupt former Wall Street investor Chase Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) Joshs childhood acquaintance-turned-criminal Slide (Eddie Murphy) soon-to-retire doorman Lester (Stephen Henderson) and Jamaican housemaid Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe) who conveniently is an ace safe cracker. The planning sessions are low on detail and big on collective riffing mostly thanks to Murphy back being funny after more than a decade as the rude motor-mouthed Slide. Also strong is Broderick as the nebbish investor playing Slides polite hangdog opposite. But the most welcome performance here comes from Leoni as a blunt unorthodox federal agent. A scene where she gets drunk with Josh is a reminder of her superb off-beat comic timing which has not really been properly showcased since she co-starred with Stiller in Flirting with Disaster back in the nineties. Tower Heist moves in fits and starts and theres far too much slack between the planning and the execution of the robbery. The actual heist though has some highly effective vertigo-inducing scenes as the crooks are required to take their surprising booty down the outside of the building overlooking the Macys parade. On the walls of Shaws luxurious pad are a number of famous-looking paintings including Andy Warhols portrait of Chairman Mao the icon of a different kind of revolution. In contrast Tower Heists topical theme of Wall Street payback reflects a more American philosophy of class warfare Steal from the rich and keep it for yourself.

David Lee/Universal Pictures Tower Heist Director Brett Ratner Genre Action Comedy Crime Running Time 104 minutes Rated PG-13; for some language and sexual content With Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller and Casey Affleck Watch Clips From Tower Heist - Its My Baby Its My Baby Credit Universal Pictures From Tower Heist - Its Just Shoplifting Its Just Shoplifting Credit Universal Pictures From Tower Heist - No Guns No Guns Credit Universal Pictures Its hard to remember that Eddie Murphy was once a dangerous talent -- flashy charismatic hyperverbal and surprisingly volatile far from the ingratiating goof of kid-friendly franchises like The Nutty Professor Dr. Doolittle and Shrek. How hard to remember? Audiences today are as far removed from his breakthrough performance as a small-time hustler in 1982s 48 Hrs. as audiences then were removed from Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr smooching on the beach in From Here To Eternity. Those who grew up with the Murphy of old are out of Hollywoods key demographic and into their second mortgage. In Tower Heist his otherwise forgettable Oceans Eleven clone director Brett Ratner smartly resurrects 48 Hrs.-era Murphy -- first by paying homage to his famous jailhouse introduction (no a cappella ""Roxanne"" this time though) then by setting the actor loose as another fast-talking crook. And while Murphys character seems conspicuously out of place -- less contemporary than thawed out after 30 years in cold storage -- his scenes bristle with a comic tension that mostly dissipates when hes not around. It doesnt help that it takes nearly 40 minutes to get him involved. In the meantime Ben Stiller slips into a familiar Everyman role as Josh Kovacs the devoted manager of New York Citys most exclusive high-rise apartment building. When the man on the top floor a Wall Street fat cat named Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) turns out to be a Madoff-style Ponzi schemer the consequences for Josh and his staff are severe. Ever trusting and deferential Josh had invested the workers pension plan in Arthurs fraudulent fund and hes told that Arthur tried to flee with just 600 left in his bank account. When an FBI agent (Tea Leoni) suggests that dirty dealers like Arthur usually keep millions tucked away in cash Josh decides to play Robin Hood by breaking into the building cracking Arthurs hidden safe and giving everyones pensions back with interest. He recruits a motley team of amateurs for the job a Wall Street washout (Matthew Broderick) the bungling concierge (Casey Affleck) the enthusiastic new elevator operator (Michael Pena) and a Jamaican maid (Precious Gabourey Sidibe) who knows how to crack safes. Murphy plays Slide a petty hoodlum from Joshs Arcadia neighborhood and the closest thing they have to an expert. i Seeing Red Alan Alda (center with Tea Leoni) and the Ferrari he keeps in his luxury-high-rise living room are the targets of both the payback plot and an FBI investigation. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Seeing Red Alan Alda (center with Tea Leoni) and the Ferrari he keeps in his luxury-high-rise living room are the targets of both the payback plot and an FBI investigation. Universal Pictures Tower Heist connects to -- or is it exploits? -- the current wave of populist frustration over high-finance chicanery and theres something inherently winning about a robbery plan where the thieves are motivated by outrage rather than by greed. Yet the plan takes far too long to germinate and once its executed in the third act so much has to be improvised on the fly that its all rendered moot anyway. Theres a germ of a great idea in thieves whove cased the joint simply by working there for years but the scope of the job becomes too big for anyone to handle much less amateurs. (The payoff works only if you believe the laws of physics dont always apply.) Between the protracted setup and the fizzled execution however Tower Heist finds a nice comic groove in the jobs planning stages when Murphy finally bursts onto the scene and pings jokes off his timid counterparts. A sequence where he tasks the amateurs each to steal 50 worth of merchandise at a mall is particularly funny but really its just a pleasure to see the Eddie Murphy of Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop again. Time will tell whether this is a rebirth or merely a throwback but he picks this generic crime comedy clean.

"Tower Heist review Tower of power |       NJ.com comments Tower Heist review Tower of power Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 04 2011 at 722 AM View/Post Comments Ben Stiller left and Eddie Murphy star in ""Tower Heist"" an action-comedy about working stiffs who seek revenge on the Wall Street swindler who stiffed them. Tower Heist"" is a movie full of swindles shoplifting lies deceptions and fraud. There are also two perilous car chases a bit of blackmailing and an assault on a federal agent. Its also one of the biggest feel-good comedies in years. Perhaps thats due to the years weve been living through. Because in this movie the real criminal is a Madoff-type billionaire. And our heroes are working folks only trying to steal their own money back. Who isnt going to cheer them on? Its a nice comeback for director Brett Ratner who stunk up the ""X-Men"" franchise and drove his own ""Rush Hour"" films into the ground. And its an enormous return for Eddie Murphy who hasnt been funny in a long time -- at least not in the flesh. Oh Murphys gotten laughs as the voice of Donkey in the ""Shrek"" series. But hes squandered so much of his comedy capital on crummy films that -- in terms of audience good will -- hes about as bankrupt as the characters in this movie. Luckily his work here should help him make a sizable deposit into his old account. Murphys surrounded by a large cast -- a smart thing as his co-star is Ben Stiller a lead whose charms can wear thin. But Michael Pena is charmingly goofy as a not-too-bright elevator operator. And good-sport Gabourey Sidibe is funny -- and clearly having great fun herself -- as a randy Jamaican-born maid. The plot has them all working in a condo building ""The Tower"" -- the renamed but still gaudy Trump monstrosity off Central Park -- with fat cat Alan Alda as their prize penthouse tenant. Except one day they discover that Alda is a swindler who as their pension-fund manager helped himself to their small savings. So convinced he has a secret stash of cash somewhere in his apartment they decide to steal it back. To do that though they need a real thief -- which is why Stiller recruits his neighbor Murphy who falls right back into the streetwise comedy he unleashed in his early days on ""Saturday Night Live"" in which he played gentlemen of leisure and poetry-spouting cons. In fact he always seems just about to go into his ""Kill My Landlord"" poem here -- and when he unleashes that familiar huge gap-toothed smile you cant help but smile back. Good as Murphy is you do wish the film gave the other actors a little more to do -- or just provided more jokes in general. There isnt a character or line here that couldnt have used some punching up. And although things pick up quickly once the actual heist is under way the lead-up -- the recruiting of the team the rehearsal of the plans -- is a bit tame. (Compare this film to a classic comedy caper like ""The Hot Rock"" and ... well it doesnt compare at all.) But Murphy is consistently good and the movies characters are naturally sympathetic. You really want these poor schlubs to get their very justified revenge -- just like you want to like this movie. It co-opts you from the very start. Which might be the films neatest nicest confidence game of all. Ratings note The film contains some strong language sexual innuendo and alcohol abuse. Tower Heist (PG-13) Universal (104 min.) Directed by Brett Ratner. With Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy Alan Alda. Now playing in New Jersey.

As occasionally convincing as co-stars Ben Stiller and Casey Affleck can be as blue-collar workers bilked of their pensions Murphys role seems to be a criminal Yoda a wisecracking ex-con with street smarts staccato delivery and quick grin.But that good-cop/good-criminal act has been rehashed for years thanks in part to Murphys terrific malefactor in 1982s 48 Hours with Nick Nolte. That raw exchange between the law and the lawless seemed a revelation then; in Heist its a repetition.About the movieTower Heist  out of fourStars Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy Casey Affleck Director Brett RatnerDistributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for language and sexual content Running time 1 hour 39 minutes Opens Friday nationwideStiller plays Josh a longtime manager of a luxury New York high-rise known simply as The Tower. He caters a tight ship for his well-heeled residents embodied by Bernie Madoff clone Arthur Shaw whose fraudulence in the securities market secured him a penthouse rooftop pool and FBI attention. Hes arrested after the feds uncover his scam -- and that Tower employees are broke.Briefly the movie hums particularly when doorman Lester (Stephen Henderson) grapples with hurtling toward retirement age with no retirement options.Ratner though is less interested in the foibles of the working class than in unleashing the inner-thief in Josh who enlists his brother-in-law Charlie (Affleck) and Slide (Murphy) to rip off Shaw for millions.That proves a road way too traveled for Heist whose finale suggests itself around the opening credits. Murphys lines play as conventionally humorous as Aldas are conventionally loathsome.Heist also stumbles over some simple logic issues. The film says Shaw has 600 in his checking account when hes arrested yet he posts 10 million bail. Attorneys work on Thanksgiving. The scheme to reimburse victimized employees? Give them stolen merchandise and let them sell it.None of the offenses are cinematic felonies. At a little more than 90 minutes Heist moves quickly enough and is good-natured. Its anti-corporate credo doesnt come off like a Michael Moore screed. Gabourey Sidibe is a nice addition though her Jamaican accent makes her sound like a 900-number clairvoyant. Michael Pena gets real laughs.Still given its cast and the days political climate what a job Heist could have pulled. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Starring Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy Matthew Broderick Tea Leoni Director Brett Ratner Running time 144 Release Opened Nov 4 2011  Editorial Review Wall Street caper not so preposterousBy Ann HornadayFriday Nov 04 2011""Tower Heist"" is an improbably satisfying action comedy the kind of wax-on-wax-off slickly machined Hollywood widget that meets its audiences expectations without once aspiring to exceed them. Ben Stiller plays Josh Kovacs the general manager of the Tower a posh apartment complex that is so similar to Manhattans Trump Tower it was filmed there. Overseeing a motley staff that includes his brother-in-law Charlie (Casey Affleck) a generously built maid named Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe) and a dunder-headed newbie named Enrique (Michael Pena) Josh proudly caters to every passing whim of his elite clientele the richest of whom is the penthouse dweller Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda). If Shaw is the Towers most demanding denizen hes also the warmest and for a while ""Tower Heist"" looks as if it might be more of a scurrying backstage drama a la ""Grand Hotel"" than a caper flick. But when the staff pensions Josh invested with Shaw disappear like the dregs of last nights single malt - and Christophe Becks retro musical score kicks in with ""Thomas Crown""-era horns - the game is afoot. If the story seems cobbled together from rejected ""Oceans Eleven"" plot points - directed with no discernible degree of finesse by Brett Ratner - ""Tower Heist"" nonetheless benefits from some terrific performances especially Eddie Murphy returning to signature form as a street criminal Josh enlists to help get the lost pension money back. Matthew Broderick as a down-on-his-luck executive whos now squatting in his former Tower apartment plays the milquetoast with a quivering air of defeat and Pena steals every scene hes in as the class dumb bunny. As enjoyable as these individual performances are they dont always emulsify into a smoothly integrated whole and there are long stretches when one or two characters seem to disappear. But that matters little in a movie that like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and ""The China Syndrome"" before it derives most of its cachet - not to mention its most cathartic laughs - from how uncannily it chimes with the times. With its Madoff-like villain radicalized ""working stiffs"" and setting of post-boom apocalypse ""Tower Heist"" may be the first-ever action comedy that could have been conceived pitched and written in Zuccotti Park. In 1956 Judy Holiday starred in one of the all-time great take-downs of greedy corporations ""The Solid Gold Cadillac""; while ""Tower Heist"" will never approach the sublime satirical heights of that classic it bears more than a few whiffs of its well-aimed indignation. And to the filmmakers credit they never make Josh and his team simply out for money and revenge; instead they ground them in a real and sympathetic community whose invisible labor supports an entire ecosystem of obscene wealth and conspicuous consumption. In another era Tower staff members would be scheming to get their own deluxe apartment in the sky; today when they go after the entire structure in an outlandish stunt orchestrated above the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade the symbolism suggests that their subversion would find favor not just with Occupy Wall Street but with icons as true-blue as Snoopy and SpongeBob SquarePants. The ""Tower Heist"" heroes often seem lifted directly from the Central Casting handbook their antics preposterous enough to beggar belief but they arrive at just the right moment. Theyre the 99 percent.Contains profanity and sexual content.

But the Bernie Madoff saga as a smart caper comedy? Impossible I would have said. ""Tower Heist"" proves me wrong. Its a cunningly engineered movie thats as much fun as ""Oceans 11"" a tale of a Renoir of ripoff whomatches skills with freewheeling improvisational rivals--the Jackson Pollocks of plunder. At a luxury Columbus Circle residential building simply called the Tower (though its actual name the Trump International Hotel and Tower is clearly visible in one scene) a dutiful building manager (Ben Stiller) has won the friendship of one of the wealthiest residents -- an investor (Alan Alda) who swims on the top of the building in a pool decorated with the image of a giant 100 bill. PHOTOS TOWER HEIST FILMING IN NEW YORK Arthur Shaw (Alda) isnt quite as genial as he seems though Hes been running a fraudulent investment scheme so under the all-seeing eye of an FBI agent (Tea Leoni) he is forced to stay home under (pent)house arrest. Josh (Stiller) is inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt until he learns that Shaw has been spending the life savings of all of the building servants gofers doormen and cleaning ladies. As Bugs Bunny would say Of course you know this means war. Josh decides to find Shaws secret stash of 20 million or so and give it to his victims. He recruits several inept amateurs including a bankrupt Wall Streeter (Matthew Broderick) whose apartment in the Tower is in foreclosure a cheerful elevator operator (the always amusing Michael Pena) and a slightly clueless concierge (Casey Affleck) married to Joshs sister. A Jamaican maid (a very funny Gabourey Sidibe the ""Precious"" star) turns out to be an expert safecracker because her dad was in the trade. Also shes a quick thinker under pressure. Getting a guard out of the way by poisoning his cake doesnt work which yields her brilliant line ""He was allergic to chocolate so I had to beat him."" No one in this band of ""Robin Hood and his merry doormen"" as someone describes them has any heist experience so Josh turns to his neighbor and former childhood playmate Slide (Eddie Murphy) who vaguely remembers the nervous 6-year-old Josh as ""seizure boy"" to direct the break-in. Murphys jailbird is the only one who edges close to cliche but it seems unfair to charge him with ripping off his own 1980s archetype in his 1980s movies. Anyway this edition of Eddie is meaner and angrier almost as if he just figured out he did ""Norbit."" The movie is a little slow to get started but the care it invests in all these character introductions pays off with interest and once we know everyone they play brilliantly off one another. The maids flirtation with Slide leads to one weirdly funny scene the guys discussion of the charms of lesbians is another and still another comes when Slide assigns each of his new co-conspirators the warm-up task of stealing 50 worth of stuff at a mall. (Josh shoplifts some panties and a scented candle.) Normally caper movies fall apart as they go along but this one gets stronger and stronger on the way to a perfect ending laying out each step of the robbery while mixing in many reversals of fortune and fresh inventive stunts. When a classic car dangles 60 stories above the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade on Central Park West its almost as much fun as the preppy Broderick characters line when he gets to point a gun for the very first time ""On the ground you punk-ass bitch"" And when a newly minted lawyer decides to blackmail the US government as her first case she shrugs and says ""Sharks are born swimming."" Director Brett Ratners movie is first-rate populist pop a film of the moment that resists the urge to belabor us with editorializing. There are no pompous speeches about greed or tendentious denunciations of capitalism just slick precision-built entertainment. This movie doesnt get huffy it gets laughs.

"Tower Heist reviewed Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller attempt to steal 20 million from Alan Alda. Slate Sign In Sign Up Tower Heist Reviewed Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller Attempt To Steal 20 Million From Alan Alda Tower Heist Reviewed Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller Attempt To Steal 20 Million From Alan Alda Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 3 2011 556 PM Tower Heist Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller attempt to steal 20 million from Alan Alda. By Dana Stevens Ben Stiller Matthew Broderick Michael Pena Casey Affleck and Eddie Murphy round out the ensemble cast in Tower Heist David Lee/(c) 2011 Universal Studios. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on Brett Ratners Tower Heist after youve seen the movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The most that can be said for Tower Heist (Universal) the new action comedy from Brett Ratner is that its a middlingly well-done evocation of the big-budget caper you remember with vague fondness from long-ago matinees at the mall. Its a mass-produced diversion to be enjoyed between a Chick-Fil-A sandwich and a visit to Spencer Gifts to caress the fiber-optic lamp. Its no Rush Hour but then neither was Rush Hour 2 or Rush Hour 3. Even at its late-90s apogee Ratners work was hardly a summit of the cinematic craft. But if the idea of Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller teaming up to steal 20 million from Alan Alda lights up any part of your movie hindbrain (as I confess it sort of does mine) you probably wont flee the theater during Tower Heist. (Does that count as a ""fresh"" or a ""rotten"" on Rotten Tomatoes?) Advertisement Ratner may be consciously paying homage to the kind of movies he used to make or he just may not know how to make any other kind. Either way Tower Heist feels retro in pacing and scale. It runs a refreshingly unbloated 104 minutes and the action scenes are less frequent and less destructive than were used to in our late-Michael Bay era. Not that this movie skimps on the spectacular stunts--one pivotal scene involves a Ferrari being lowered from a skyscraper window by a winch while a man dangles from the front fender--but in comparison with say the last Fast Five movie this is a miniaturist character study. Tower Heist does have one plot element that ties it not only to the present day but to current events. By making Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) the victim of the titular heist a Bernie Madoff-like shyster the film gives its conventional gang-who-couldnt-shoot-straight story a cathartic populist charge. As social commentary goes this may be pretty toothless but who doesnt need a Madoff voodoo doll to abuse? Aldas Shaw owns the penthouse apartment in a hyperexclusive Manhattan building called ""The Tower"" (played at least in some exterior shots by Trump Tower). Its clear to the audience from the first shot--Shaw does laps in his own private rooftop swimming pool painted to look like a 100 bill--that this man is a contemptible snake but to the staff at the Tower headed up by general manager Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) Shaw has always been a favorite resident friendly generous and relatively undemanding. When Shaw is arrested on charges of securities fraud Joshs first instinct is to believe in his claims of innocence even to defend him to the Tower staff. But when Josh learns that Shaw has gambled away the employees retirement fund in a Ponzi scheme he commits an unwise act that gets him fired from the Tower along with his concierge brother-in-law (Casey Affleck) and an affable but dimwitted elevator operator (Michael Pena). Together with a laid-off Wall Streeter whos been evicted from the building (Matthew Broderick) they scheme to steal Shaws secret 20 million stash which according to the FBI agent assigned to the case (Tea Leoni) may be somewhere inside his apartment. But these three law-abiding white guys--well two white guys and one self-proclaimed ""Puerto Rican Mohican""--dont know the first thing about robbery so they decide to bring Joshs neighbor a small-time criminal called Slide (Eddie Murphy) in on their plans. In the movies funniest scenes Slide attempts to tutor the bumbling conspirators while the detail-oriented Josh builds Lego scale models of the Towers lobby to map out his sub-Oceans 11 infiltration scheme. Eventually this crew is joined by Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe) a Jamaican housekeeper at the hotel whos a whiz at safecracking (and double-entendre wisecracking). The combined efforts of this fine ensemble cast make Tower Heist go down easier than it otherwise might but the films potential as a buddy comedy is sadly wasted. Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy strike plenty of sparks off one another--Stiller is a master at communicating stifled resentment and Murphy in fine fettle can get laughs with the tilt of an eyebrow--but the arcs of both characters as well as the arc of their relationship remain half-drawn. Stillers Josh goes ballistic way too early in the film and after his big meltdown scene in the crooked bankers apartment the character has no room left to grow. Murphys Slide never quite comes into focus in the screenplay by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson--is he an amoral double-crosser or does he come to identify with Stillers Robin Hood mission? Without giving too much away about the ending I can say that Slide disappears much too abruptly from the story--unless I blinked and missed it hes entirely absent from the epilogue montage. Its probably a losers game to ask for better craftsmanship from a movie like Tower Heist but even crowd-pleasing big-budget comedies would seem to owe both of their top-billed actors a final scene. And giving Murphy and Stiller one last emotional beat together--whether it was a warm buddy-buddy moment or an uneasy truce--would also have allowed Ratner to explore some of the race and class issues his movie only begins to touch on. In one of the movies best lines the black maid Odessa told that her retirement savings have been lost in a risky investment scheme icily tells her white boss ""For the record I never asked anyone to triple my portfolio."" But when the two of them join forces to rob the really bad guy on the top floor all labor-vs.-capital conflict is forgotten. Similarly Tower Heist offers its viewers a matinee-length dose of enjoyable catharsis as long as they dont ask too many questions.

Whippet thin and lightning quick Murphy finds a fountain of youth in this role a smalltime thief who helps a band of bilked workingmen seek revenge on a white-collar crook (Alan Alda oozing unctuousness like an old pro).Tower Heist starts off like an amiable workplace sitcom as the manager of a luxury Upper West Side housing tower (Ben Stiller taking a welcome break from the comedy of humiliation) walks us through the joint and smoothly introduces us to his colleagues and one downtrodden resident a ruined Wall Street veteran played by Matthew Broderick. The supporting cast is among the movies strengths from Michael Pena Casey Affleck and Gabourey Sidibe as high-rise workers to Tea Leoni flashing vintage comic timing as a raspy-voiced FBI agent who delivers the bad news Everyones pension has been embezzled by the rich crook in the penthouse apartment upstairs.Enter Murphy who reminds us that he once reinvented the role of the fast-thinking loudmouth hustler. If you dont quite get the point theres even a quick jailhouse homage to 48 Hours (followed for some reason by a nod to the famous French Connection chase scene). The mechanics of his enlistment in the revenge scheme are ridiculous but Tower Heist is still at its best in the planning stages when the actors are allowed to riff and the characters gain a little bit of definition.Murphys role here bears more than a passing resemblance to Jamie Foxxs in Horrible Bosses. It seems all a group of bumbling white would-be felons needs to do the job is a fast-talking black guy lending advice. Still the tutelage scenes are the funniest in the movie. The veteran thief tests his charges by having each steal something from the mall and the gag works by making shoplifting look like the easiest thing in the world. In the same sequence a bit of inspired movie banter flows from The Doberman Gang to The Boys From Brazil to Boys Dont Cry without missing a beat. (Pena is particularly good here; hes turning into a fine comic actor.)Then the actual job commences the sloppy plot ellipses start adding up and the wheels spin and spin away. Director Brett Ratner has proudly conceded that he makes populist action-comedy schlock and thats exactly what he ends up with here. Very little makes sense about the second half of Tower Heist which seems to wear its increasingly empty spectacle and incoherence as a badge of honor. Dangle a vintage sports car high over the streets of Manhattan? Why not weve got the budget.Steven Soderberghs carefully plotted Oceans heist movies eventually got a little tedious in their minutiae. Tower Heist doesnt have such problems. Its content to turn the job into a series of goofs. You can get away with that when you have a Murphy-size personality onboard but it still kind of feels like a con.Tower HeistB- Starring Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller Michael Pena Tea Leoni Alan Alda Mathew Broderick Casey Affleck Gabourey Sidibe and Stephen Henderson.

"""Tower Heist"" an amusing revenge-on-Wall Street tale - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Ben StillerMovie review Tower HeistA comic revenge tale about taking on Wall Street uses the talents of Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller and Alan Alda to score some au courant laughs.November 04 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Josh (Ben Stiller from left) Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) DevReaux... (David Lee / Universal Pictures )""Tower Heist"" is a modern comic fable about working stiffs (the serving class of a cushy NYC high-rise) stung by Wall Street excesses (the penthouse billionaire the lost pension fund) trying to stick it to ""the man"" in some soul-satisfying ways. So a downer that is an upper in an ""Upstairs Downstairs"" kind of way. But hey well take the laughs where we can get them in these bleak times right? And with Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy top-lining this high-gloss house of cards sometimes it works. Or at least that seems to be what director Brett Ratner and screenwriters Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson are counting on. But just in case Ratner is in more of a rush than he ever was for the ""Rush Hour"" trilogy with Jackie Chan trying to zoom right past all the gaping holes in the completely implausible plot. I guess the hope is that no one will noticea|. You will but then you may not care (see ""bleak times"" above). It is present-day Manhattan and the Tower is a tightly run high-class condo managed by a tightly wound attention-to-every-little-detail Josh Kovaks (Stiller). Josh has gotten so comfortable rubbing shoulders with the resident elites a particularly the top dog at the top of his game and the owner of the Towers top suite Wall Street guru Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) a that he sometimes forgets hes ""not one of them."" The big be-careful-who-you-trust takedown comes when an FBI sting led by Agent Claire Denham (TA(c)a Leoni) reveals Arthurs billion-dollar fraud a which includes the Tower employee pension fund. In very short order Josh goes from disbelief to plotting revenge. Like all of these failed money guys Josh figures Arthur must have hidden assets and he is determined to get his hands on them. Thus is this ""Im mad as hell and Im not going to take it anymore"" caper born. But it takes a thief. For that there is the questionable criminal mind of a local thug named Slide (Murphy). Murphy and Stiller are a good pair with Murphy once again mainlining his ghetto-comedy crazy and Stiller suited up for another straight-man gig. These are the kinds of roles they both do best and their face-off in the front seat of an out-of-control car is worth the price of admission. There is also some help from the help because a caper needs its share of misfits. Among them Joshs very dense brother-in-law/concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck hit-and-miss amusing) new elevator operator Enrique (Michael PeA+-a snap crackle and popping) and Odessa a Jamaican maid (Gabourey Sidibe struggling with the accent mon) with a recently evicted former broker Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick bedeviled and bewildered) brought in for some money-skimming tips. Before its over everything from Steve McQueens classic red roadster to Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade will factor into the ""never-forget-its-a-high-rise"" high jinks. Think dizzying rooftops floor-to-ceiling windows long elevator shafts and lots of reasons to look down. The film even when it slips into fiasco has considerable polish with cinematographer Dante Spinottis (""L.A. Confidential"") clever eye and a crack creative crew that includes Kristi Zea (""Revolutionary Road"") on production design and Mark Russell (""The Adjustment Bureau"") responsible for some major palm-sweating visual effects. But what the movie does best is the unintentional stuff. ""Tower Heist"" reminds you of the raw comic brilliance Murphy brought to ""Saturday Night Live"" all those years ago. With the exception of his hee-hee-haw Donkey in ""Shrek"" Murphy hasnt been this funny since ""Beverly Hills Cop"" the first edition. You come away wishing he had more screen time (especially since the movie albeit in a very different form was apparently his idea in the first place). Then there is Brodericks ability to get lost inside his own neurosis which he does to charming effect with his failed stockbroker so broken you actually feel a flicker of empathy for the guy. And for Arthur Alda resurrects some of the slick sarcasm that served him so well in ""MASH"" adding a lot more mean for his well-played bit of well-heeled scum a any resemblance to Bernie Madoff is surely intentional. The movie also reminds just how many filmmakers misuse Leonis comic talents. Her tantalizing cross between Katharine Hepburns ""Bringing Up Baby"" smarts and Lucille Balls fearless ""I Love Lucy"" physicality is totally misused here. Will somebody please get it right? What the filmmakers do get right is using our collective economic angst for some comic relief. ""Tower Heist"" might not be a classic (its not) but at least for a little while it will make you laugh instead of cry about the current state of affairs which is more than you can say about a lot of things. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew on DVDFebruary 19 2012The Sunday Conversation Alan AldaNovember 11 2011A long-planned HeistNovember 3 2011The Directors Brett Ratner Tower HeistSeptember 4 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTBen StillerPension FundAlan AldaCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-tower-heist-20111104,0,5492512.story?track=rss",200,towerheist15,towerheist,latimes

Universal Studios By John Anderson November 4 2011 Any resemblance between the crime comedy ""Tower Heist"" and say ""The Anderson Tapes"" ""The Hot Rock"" or ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"" are solely in the mind of Brett Ratner. The director whose fame rests almost entirely on the lucrative ""Rush Hour"" franchise has claimed the aforementioned 1970s New York City caper films as an inspiration for his own. But the more obvious muse behind ""Tower Heist"" was Bernie Madoff which is apt--the movie is redolent with the aroma of con artistry and vanished money. The movies Madoff manque is a shifty financier named Arthur Shaw (a perfectly unctuous Alan Alda) who occupies the penthouse of ""The Tower""--a building that in keeping with the films fidelity to understatement is actually the Trump International Hotel amp; Tower on Manhattans Columbus Circle a luxury dwelling where a staff led by chief lickspittle Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) pampers a plush population. Shaw has taken a liking to Josh. And why not? Josh lives to serve. A smile from someone like Shaw is precisely what he lives for. Its also why he has handed over to Shaw the building staffs retirement account so the moneyman can work his magic. And he has Hes made the whole fund disappear. Mr. Alda is a wonderful actor one who never seems to get his due probably thanks to the enormous success he had early on in television. His performance here makes one think of his equally obnoxious performance in Woody Allens ""Crimes and Misdemeanors""--not because the roles are similar but because theyre so different yet comparably despicable. Being synonymous with likeability is something any decent actor would use to his advantage with a role like Arthur Shaw. But Mr. Alda really seems to relish the perversity of the situation. And works it like a scalpel. Far more ham-handed are the rest of the cast notably Mr. Stiller and his principal co-star Eddie Murphy playing a street thief named Slide who Josh enlists to help rob Shaws apartment and get the money back. At this point in the process of plot summary the implausibilities begin to mount and explanation begins to sound like apology. How do they know Shaw has the money in the safe in his wall? Im sorry I dont know. How do they even know Shaw is guilty as hes only been indicted? Again no clue. How do they possibly convince Shaw his team of high-priced lawyers and even our intrepid FBI agent Claire Denham (Tea Leoni an unsung comedy genius) that his court hearing is on Thanksgiving Day? Even the guard at 100 Centre Street looks confused. This gambit does of course allow Mr. Ratner to stage the big heist during the Macys parade. But come on. There is also little explanation for why a talented and well-established actor such as Matthew Broderick would bring his nuanced sense of comedic timing to a movie so lacking in nuance comedy or timing. One can understand why a newcomer like Gabourey Sidibe (""Precious"") would allow herself to be as cruelly misused as she is here by Mr. Ratner. And why Eddie Murphy who needs a hit would sign on too. (Mr. Ratner who is directing next years Oscar show has already cast Mr. Murphy as its host). But the type of film with which Mr. Ratner has claimed to be infatuated is itself like a caper--it requires precise execution. ""Tower Heist"" is more like that 10-story Snoopy as he drunkenly bobs along Central Park West. Young Goethe in Love Try not to giggle The original European title of this soapy reduction was ""Goethe"" As in ""Oliver"" Or even better ""Airplane"" Theres nothing inherently hilarious about this story directed by Philipp Stolzl (of the respected ""North Face""). Doesnt the reigning genius of the German language deserve his own ""Shakespeare in Love""? Sure. But as Goethe scampers about Leipzig comically failing his doctoral exam spilling his books and looking bemused young Johann might as well be auditioning for his own Disney Channel program. It doesnt help that hes being played by Alexander Fehling (""Inglourious Basterds"") who suggests a Teutonic Matthew McConaughey. What has all this to do with Goethe the man who wrote ""Faust"" and with the possible exception of Friedrich Schiller towers over the entirety of German literature? Not much at least in terms of tone gravity or poetry snippets of which might have been composed by Johann von Hallmark. But as a dramatic prelude to the writing of Goethes breakthrough work ""The Sorrows of Young Werther"" the film follows the facts While living in the smallish burg of Wetzlar Goethe was indeed involved with Charlotte Buff (played by the ravishing Miriam Stein); her fiance was Goethes fellow counselor-at-law Albert Kestner (the ubiquitous Moritz Bleibtreu); their mutual friend Wilhelm Jerusalem (Volker Bruch) did in fact kill himself for love. At the age of 23 Goethe reimagined the entire episode--""wrought"" might be the better term--into the passion play of ""Werther."" With ""Goethe"" Mr. Stolzl takes the writers artistic achievement and synthesis of real-life experience and turns it back on itself while imposing upon it dramatic conventions that Goethe himself would have greeted with a resounding ""Nein"" Oh well. Viewers should perhaps be grateful that Goethes poetry isnt being attributed to the Earl of Oxford. The story Having failed his Ph.D. exam the budding poet is banished to Wetzlar by his disapproving father (Henry Hubchen) to study law under the rigorous oversight of Kestner an intelligent but unattractive martinet who has his eye on a local girl Lotte. Flame-haired sexily disheveled Lotte is the eldest of eight motherless children whose father is all but helpless and dependent on his daughter to make an advantageous match. Lotte who is in love with Johann naturally--and predictably--rebels. As per the dictates of our current culture all ages preceding our own are merely prelude Lotte is a liberated woman albeit one held hostage by the age of Weimar Classicism. The situation resolves itself correctly Goethe did not in the end marry Lotte. But the films generally myopic approach to history is epidemic; for proof one need look no further than the early-1960s revisionism taking place on screens large and small (""Mad Men"" ""Pan Am"" ""The Help"" etc.). Its also unworthy of Mr. Stolzl who amid all the facile antics does manage to show his directorial mettle if only in a single and critical scene Johann and Kestner who have already exchanged the intimate details of their respective love lives suddenly realize that the ""women"" theyve been talking about are both Lotte. Its a moment that might have been played for farce--and considering the rest of the film thats what you would expect. Instead what we get is a more delicately handled and dramatically honest scene than can be seen anywhere else this season. Or for that matter anywhere else in ""Young Goethe in Love."" The Last Rites of Joe May ENLARGE Dennis Farina as Joe May Tribeca Films I have to confess an undying fondness for Dennis Farina that dates back to TVs ""Crime Story"" and includes all the seedy oily dubiously charming characters hes played in some of the oddest of independent movies (""You Kill Me"" for instance or ""Bottle Shock""). Having all that Mr. Farina in ones head--including his too-short stint on ""Law amp; Order""--might put a valedictory spin on ""The Last Rites of Joe May"" director Joe Maggios gritty atmospheric Chicago crime drama. But Mr. Farina has never been more in control of his ""instrument"" as actors like to say or more convincing. The title character a petty criminal with an inflated sense of his own importance checks out of a county hospital after a seven-week stay with no one there to meet him or as he soon learns anywhere to go. Assuming Joe had died his landlord has rented out his apartment to single-mother Jenny (Jamie Anne Allman) and her daughter Angelina (a terrific Meredith Droeger). Jenny is hard-up enough to let Joe stay; hes desperate enough to pay the rent. The relationship that builds among them especially between Joe and Angelina is thoroughly real. And though it smacks of a ""Will Penny""-style western Joes confrontation with Jennys abusive boyfriend a Chicago cop named Stanley (Ian Barford) is both honest and exhilarating. The truth is Mr. Farina would be considered Oscar material if ""Joe May"" were a bigger film. As it is hell have to settle for being great. The Son of No One ENLARGE Channing Tatum and James Ransone in The Son of No One Anchor Bay Films Its understandable that Dito Montiel being a filmmaker would have an affinity for pre-Giuliani New York The chaos crime and desiccation of a place consuming itself is far more cinematic than a well-ordered metropolis. But part of the hang-up with Mr. Montiels new film is that he cant let go of the past In telling the story of Jonathan White (Channing Tatum) a police officer who got away with killing two predatory junkies during his boyhood in a decrepit Queens housing project Mr. Montiel cant let flashbacks be flashbacks and move his story along the contemporary track where it belongs. Hes stuck in the aesthetic mire of a vanished city. Jonathan who was known as a kid as ""Milk"" is the son of a slain policeman whose partner (Al Pacino) buried the evidence of the two killings. Years later a reporter at a local Queens paper (Juliette Binoche) is getting mysterious letters referring to the unsolved deaths. Those who were involved including Jonathans superior officer (Ray Liotta) are getting panicky. But despite all the nervous tension the central drama is flawed--Jonathan isnt trying to find a killer. He is the killer. Something is lacking in the dramatic equation. Mr. Montiel used his Queens boyhood as a backdrop for his debut film ""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"" which featured Robert Downey Jr. Rosario Dawson Shia LaBeouf and then-newcomer Channing Tatum. Mr. Tatum starred in Mr. Montiels followup ""Fighting"" and now does yeoman duty in ""The Son of No One."" Mr. Montiel knows what he likes. Mr. Tatum unlike bygone New York repays the compliment. --Mr. Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is off this week. DVD Focus Shakespeare in Love (1998) This Elizabethan souffle somewhat infamously snatched away the presumptive Best Picture Academy Award of ""Saving Private Ryan"" while disproving the old assumptions about Oscars aversion to comedy. It stars Joseph Fiennes as a somewhat dithering Bard and Gwyneth Paltrow as the woman who inspires him while occasionally dressing in drag. Although the current ""Anonymous"" plays much greater havoc with the sanctity of Shakespeare this John Madden-directed costume comedy which co-starred Tom Wilkinson Geoffrey Rush and Oscar-winner Judi Dench doth take its share of indecent liberties. ENLARGE Amadeus Warner Bros./Everett Collection Amadeus (1984) The problem with movies about genius is that they are so infrequently made by geniuses--which is one of the many exceptional things about this eight-time Oscar winner. Milos Formans Mozart (played by Tom Hulce) is a frolicking flatulent infant who just happens to have been touched by Gods tuning fork. The discordant counterpoint is provided by F. Murray Abrahams dyspeptic Salieri who remembers ""Wolfie"" in all his awfulness. Whether the real Mozart was quite so inebriated with himself is where Mozart scholars take exception but a great movie can be forgiven its historical lapses. ENLARGE Pollock Sony Pictures/Everett Collection Pollock (2000) Faithful affectionate and ultimately grief-stricken this biography of Jackson Pollock starred Ed Harris (who also directed) as the tragic giant of Abstract Expressionism whose artistic breakthroughs contentious relationship with wife Lee Krasner (Marcia Gay Harden) and losing battle with alcohol are the crux of what became an art-house hit. Among its rather adventurous supporting cast Jeffrey Tambor plays critic Clement Greenberg Jennifer Connelly is Pollocks mistress Ruth Kligman and Amy Madigan does an outrageous turn as heiress Peggy Guggenheim. Both Mr. Harris and Ms. Harden received Academy Award nominations. Ms. Harden won. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Botanists Sniff at Mystery of Smelly Plants Flowering Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Their target in this jovial but lazy economy comedy (Can we call it an econ com? Ok lets call it an econ com.) is a smooth talking Bernie Madoff-like character named Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who is under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. The staff at The Tower has been fiercely loyal to Arthur particularly building manager Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) who is so devoted that he listens to cooking shows for ideas on which cheese and wine pairings Arthur should serve at dinner parties. Josh even doubts that Arthur could really be guilty of the Ponzi scheme that he has been accused of perpetrating. But everyone from Charlie the concierge (Casey Affleck) to Odessa the Jamaican maid (Gabourey Sidibe) turn on the mogul when they discover that he not only lost the staffs entire pension fund but whats more doesnt feel any remorse. Even news that his buildings bereft elderly doorman tried to throw himself in front of a subway train doesnt ruffle this 1 percenters feathers. (MORE How close are Madoffs Victims to Getting Their Money Back?) Of course Tower Heist isnt dark enough to actually kill off the doorman. This is after all a film from Brett Ratner the director behind the cheerfully mindless Rush Hour franchise. Despite its ripped from the headlines topic Ratner and a quartet of writers keep it light. Plotting for the heist itself -- which Josh dreams up after an indiscreet FBI agent (Tea Leoni) tips him off about a missing 20 million that might be in Arthurs apartment -- is entirely lackadaisical. Not even the perpetrators including Charlie Odessa and elevator man Enrique (Michael Pena) know whats going on. Theyre smarter than the Stooges but not by much. Imagine the Oceans Eleven caper being planned by the hotel staff from Maid in Manhattan. Stiller steers the movie like an expert concierge making sure that everything runs smoothly without drawing much attention to himself. Instead the best comic moments come from the outsiders that Josh invites to join his crew. Sad sack Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) is a former 1 percenter having worked at Merrill Lynch and has the distinction of having been the first ever Tower resident to be foreclosed on and subsequently evicted. Hes good with numbers but better at deadpan jokes. Josh also brings in Slide (Eddie Murphy) his loudmouthed neighbor from Queens as a criminal consultant. Murphys is a funnier version of a similar part played by Jamie Foxx played in this summers Horrible Bosses. (Who says that black actors and actresses have fewer opportunities in Hollywood?) Slide talks tough -- the scene where he makes the crew prove their mettle by shoplifting at the mall is fun - but doesnt have real experience with break ins preferring to thieve from balconies. ""What do you steal potted plants?"" asks Mr. Fitzhugh half in wonder half in sarcasm. (MORE Top Ten Post-SNL Careers) Its hard to go completely wrong when youve got Broderick shuffling around in a bathrobe and Murphy scampering in black leather. They both look notably aged Broderick in a puffy way while Murphy seems to only be getting leaner. Yet both bring a kick to the movie. So do Alda who expertly navigates Arthurs turn from benevolent to nasty and Sidibe even though her lines are fairly deplorable. No actress of size should be required to spin a joke from the line ""lets talk about the elephant in the room"" but Sidibe manages it without losing her dignity. She got noticed (and Oscar-nominated) for the uber-serious Precious but its clear she relishes the chance to make people laugh. Theres a little scene where Odessa flirts with Slide and Murphy actually looks daunted by the force of her. These two deserve their own movie. But certainly not one helmed by Ratner. Hes a grab bag director who understands how to string big elements (like actors and scenarios) together but doesnt seem interested in the small details that make a movie gel like timelines and continuity. Tower Heist culminates with some slapstick involving a red Ferrari dangling from The Tower. Its a cool stunt and my stomach did a few back flips as various actors dangled off it high above the streets. But Ratner is in such a rush to score his money shot that he doesnt bother to to justify it or for that matter make the haphazard plot fit together. I have to give him credit though; hes got his finger on the pulse. Though Tower Heist doesnt reach any great heights its very existence speaks volumes about how mainstream the class war has become.

Otherwise more movies like Tower Heist are going to be made. More about Tower Heist >> A big-star caper about a disgruntled gang of sad sacks plotting to rob a Madoff-style fat cat whos lit off with their savings Tower Heist comes from Brett Ratner (one of Hollywoods fattest cats) applying a polished populist sheen to an Oceans Eleven-ish split-second-timing safecracking vehicle. The setting is ""the most expensive apartment building in North America"" a Trumpian condo on Central Park West where manager Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) oversees a crack crew of maids maintenance guys doormen elevator operators and concierges. When the Towers richest resident Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is arrested by the feds for fraud Kovacs has to tell his staff that the penthouse-dwelling investor had been handling their pensions. Whats left? Nothing. The veteran doorman (Stephen McKinley Henderson) is so bummed he tries to throw himself in front of a subway. And so a plot born of revenge - and the certitude that Shaw has millions stashed in his apartment - is born. But how are Kovacs concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck) new employee Enrique (Michael Pena) and a failed foreclosed investment banker (a doughy Matthew Broderick) going to pull off this job? Not a one has a clue on the ins and outs of B and E. So Kovacs seeks the guidance of Slide a fast-talking street mug from Queens with an impressive arrest record. Eddie Murphy wearing a do-rag and a comically contemptuous scowl plays the guy with more fire and flair than weve seen from the star in quite a while. A scene with Slide ordering his motley gang of amateurs to prove their mettle by lifting 50 worth of merchandise from retailers in a mall is amusing and his exchanges with Precious Gabourey Sidibe (shes a maid with a Jamaican accent and safecracking chops) are charged with comic innuendo. Devoting more time to the setup than to the follow-through Tower Heist doesnt really build suspense so much as it builds impatience - for the thing to be over. Tea Leoni trying out some quasi-New York intonations is an FBI agent assigned to the Shaw case who then finds herself in a romantic assignation with Stillers character. The heist itself is set for Thanksgiving Day with the Macys Parade and its giant balloons providing distraction. In fact a sign of the level of sophistication that Stiller and company - and Ratner and company - are operating on The timing of the break-in hinges on the assumption that the Towers security team will drop everything when the big Snoopy float trundles down Central Park and stops at their door.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Comedy is funnier when it rebounds off a hard reality and the money woes underpinning ""Tower Heist"" give the caper a solid bounce. Its a stunt-heavy comedy but its world resembles ours more than most movies do. A working-class ""Oceans Eleven"" reflecting our economic mess is a vision a lot more relevant -- and funnier -- than comedies about men in drag competitive bird watchers or talking zoo animals. Ben Stiller plays the manager of a luxury high-rise who leads the employees in a raid on penthouse owner Alan Alda a scheming financier who vaporized their pensions while keeping a golden parachute for himself. Eddie Murphy comes aboard as a cool back-talking crime consultant. Not only do we vicariously participate in their coup and revel as wit and grit triumph over financial power we have the bonus of seeing two top comic actors escape their long imprisonment in flaccid family movies. This is surely the comedy cast of the year. Stiller is the vulnerable understated balance to Murphys high-wire exuberance. Alda is wonderful as the slick tycoon glad-handing the residential towers employees with an oily layer of fraternal bonhomie. Matthew Broderick is priceless as a melancholy ex-Wall Streeter whose bankruptcy also wiped out his self-confidence. Casey Affleck is droll and sleepy-eyed as the quietly ambitious desk clerk and Michael Pena is gallon-of-Red-Bull hyper as the newly hired elevator operator. Gabourey Sibide is an immigrant maid in need of a marriage visa and Tea Leoni plays an FBI agent who is first on Aldas tail then on the penthouse raiders. The cast is a jabber of Jews and Koreans Jamaicans and WASPs Russians and Italians bantering and snapping and flirting at each other. Without straining to deliver a message the diversely entertaining personalities say something optimistic about America. The mechanics of the heist are far-fetched even for a Brett Ratner action comedy and the plot leaves enough unresolved lines dangling to knit a fringed afghan. Still why gripe? The script has some fine original scenes including a sequence in which Murphy assigns his untested co-conspirators to prove their determination by shoplifting something. Universal Pictures Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy in ""Tower Heist."" Its full of well-timed impediments to the robbery and peppered with sly references to the featured actors earlier efforts from ""Trading Places"" to ""Ferris Bueller"" to the ""Ocean"" movies. I left the movie happy but wishing that the womens roles were as fleshed out as the mens. At the end of a barroom scene with Stiller Leoni does a funny half-drunk stumble-step that momentarily reminds you what a fine physical comedian she is. Maybe well see more of them in the sequel thats likely to follow.

"Tower Heist (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Tower Heist (PG-13) Eddie Murphy returns to form in this ensemble comedy but the rest of the movie cant keep up. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/3/2011 Editor rating 2 There are several stretches in Tower Heist in which the movie achieves the plate-spinning energy that every caper comedy strives for. In one of them a gang of amateur robbers tries to steal a cherry-red Ferrari -- yes an entire car -- from the living room of a huge penthouse on the top floor of a luxury Manhattan apartment building without being spotted (oh and the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade is marching past the building at the same time). The premise is preposterous and absurd but thats exactly the point and the long set piece is so well directed that you cant even spot the special-effects work. The sequence plays to the strengths of director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour X-Men The Last Stand) who is adept at choreographing large-scale action and mayhem His movies all have physical heft and a strong sense of place. But characters - people - trip him up. Ratner has rounded up an impressive ensemble cast (Ben Stiller Matthew Broderick Casey Affleck Gabourey Sibide and an invigorated Eddie Murphy) to play the staff members of the eponymous condo tower who plot an elaborate robbery to steal back the pensions that a Bernie Madoff-ish crook (Alan Alda) took from them. The script is by Ted Griffin (Oceans Eleven) and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can) who have proven themselves more than capable of writing brisk smart entertainments. But Ratner lets the seams show. You can practically diagram every scene in the film The ones that slip in the backstories of the characters (Afflecks wife is eight months pregnant; Sibides work visa is about to expire) the ones that reveal important information in-between the laughs (Tea Leonis excellent moment as an FBI agent whos had too much to drink) the ones intended to inject some emotion into the picture (an attempted suicide) and the ones where the actors were allowed to riff and improvise (practically any scene in which Murphy appears). Ratner understands the primary appeal of ensemble comedies is to cram as many of his stars as possible into each scene and Broderick is fun to watch as a ruined stock market analyst riffing opposite Murphy whos back in 48 HRS./Beverly Hills Cop form as a small-time criminal. Pena reveals some fine comedic chops as the towers newly-hired elevator operator and even Stiller as the buildings manager fares OK as the straight-laced guy who is the butt of everyones jokes. What should have felt effortless and light though often comes off as laborious. Tower Heist constantly makes you aware of the buttons and levers the movie is pushing and pulling Theres something artificial and plastic about the film that keeps you from ever truly getting lost into it. Ratner was originally offered the opportunity to direct Oceans Eleven but he passed to make a Rush Hour sequel instead and Steven Soderbergh stepped in and delivered a polished pop entertainment that spawned two sequels. With Tower Heist Ratner wants to find out how his Oceans Eleven might have turned out but I can pretty much guarantee you there will never be a Tower Heist 2 (the ending of the film is particularly flat and sloppy.) The best thing about this mildly diverting but instantly forgettable comedy is that it seems to have awakened something in Murphy that had laid dormant for much of the past two decades. Practically every scene hes in crackles with energy and spunk (including a hilarious riff about a ""gauntlet of lesbians"" that sounds like it was ad-libbed on the set with everyone following Murphys lead.) If Tower Heist marks the beginning of Murphys comeback as an adult comedian -- his hosting of next years Oscars will be the next step -- then the film will have been worth it. But surely this expensive grand-looking movie was intended to be something more than just a footnote in an actors career.

The character winds up being a walking metaphor for the movie itself which boasts a terrific cast gorgeous cinematography and a caper-flick score that drives the action. Too bad that when its over you realize that the characters arent interesting and the titular heist wasnt all that thrilling. Arthur Shaw (Alda) lives atop the Tower New Yorks priciest and most exclusive high-rise where a devoted staff sees to the needs of its demanding tenants. Running that staff is Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) whos so devoted to his job that he seems to have little time for any fun apart from the online chess games hes always losing to Shaw. Shaw gets arrested for fraud and Josh is forced to tell the staff that hed given their pension fund over to Shaw to invest for them. FBI special agent Claire (Tea Leoni) tells Josh that they didnt find any money in Shaws apartment but Josh remembers that Shaw had installed a hidden wall safe years earlier. With blind faith that Shaws emergency nest egg is locked in that safe Josh decides to plan a robbery using the knowledge that he and his brother-in-law building concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck) have of the Tower to get the money out under the nose of Shaw and the FBI agents watching over him while hes under house arrest. On paper this has all the makings of a great caper comedy from a timely revenge-on-the-rich-guy plotline to terrific New York locations shot by Dante Spinotti to a jazzy Lalo Schifrin-esque score by Christophe Beck to a snappy comic ensemble (which also includes Eddie Murphy as Joshs childhood-acquaintance-turned-petty-thief Judd Hirsch as a humorless building manager and Gabourey Sidibe as a maid with a talent for safe-cracking). Where ""Tower Heist"" goes asunder is in Brett Ratners direction and the script by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson -- the greatest caper movies give us intricately planned break-ins where each element of the scheme falls into place like the tumblers of a lock but this one gets shamelessly sloppy. Were told for instance that Thanksgiving (when the robbery is taking place) is the busiest day of the year at The Tower with multiple dinner parties going on and catering trucks coming and going all day; why then are the hallways and lobby so empty of anyone besides building staff? Security guards are diverted not by the thieves planning but by sheer coincidence. And why would Matthew Brodericks sad-sack financial analyst who just got evicted from the building be recruited for the heist when he brings no special skills to the table? ""Tower Heist"" promises far more than it delivers; the movie executes a car chase through the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade (NBCUniversal synergy at work no doubt) and works the hubbub of the event into the plot but then all it does with the parade is give Stiller and company a moment to sneak into a door while everyones watching Snoopy. Not that the script does any better with the human element -- sure everyone involved in the crime has a motivation but who are they? Murphys and Sidibes characters flirt for five seconds for instance but then its never mentioned again. It takes a cast this talented to flesh out such meager characterizations. The MVP here would have to be Michael Pena who brings his uniquely screwball comic skills (the ones that made him the only thing worth seeing ""30 Minutes or Less"" for) as a newly hired elevator operator who becomes integral to the robbery. The hope was that ""Tower Heist"" would mark Murphys return to form putting him in the kind of action-comedy role that originally brought him fame in films like ""48 HRS."" and ""Beverly Hills Cop."" And while he doesnt embarrass himself here it just all feels a little rote and familiar by this time just like Stillers tightly wound Type-A guy. The top-quality ingredients of ""Tower Heist"" make it at least painless to sit through and the movie does pull off a few action set pieces that are vertiginously exciting. Its just too bad that Ratner isnt craftsman enough to keep this souffle from collapsing. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Indeed when you consider the breathtaking mendacity of American public life in which competing tribes of millionaires claim to speak for the common man people like Brett Ratner and Eddie Murphy and Ben Stiller look as pure as the driven snow. Still its pretty rich in the current context to see class war brought to the big screen with Stiller and Murphy two of Tinseltowns wealthiest imperialists as the exploited working stiffs who seek criminal revenge against an abusive tycoon in ""Tower Heist."" I suppose weve always wanted our celebrities and potentates to seem authentic and relatable on one level but also to lead lives of unimaginable excess. To put it another way Dont cry for me Argentina.""Tower Heist"" doesnt have half the agenda of say Andrew Niccols futuristic Justin Timberlake thriller ""In Time"" which already has about half an agenda. This is a heist caper flick for viewers who found ""Oceans Eleven"" and its sequels too boring. (Actually the original concept here was purportedly an African-American ""Oceans""-type movie starring Murphy and Chris Rock and Im sort of sorry that didnt get made.) The screenplay -- which is by the now-customary five-headed Hollywood hydra; go look em up -- bounces off a few real-world events like Bernie Madoffs Ponzi scheme and the career of Donald Trump but the plot is 110 percent nonsense and an excuse for lots of genial goofballing and vulgar bling which is what we all came for.We actually get one of Stillers more likable roles and Murphys funniest in several years which is definitely damning with faint praise in both cases. Their inept criminal gang also features modestly amusing turns from Casey Affleck Michael Pena and Gabourey Sidibe along with Matthew Broderick as a depressed Wall Street dude whose 5 million apartment has been repossessed. Alan Alda nearly steals the show as evil but folksy zillionaire Arthur Shaw who regales his luxury condo towers staff with tales of his days shoveling horseshit at Aqueduct racetrack. (He reminds me of Jimmy Breslins description of Ronald Reagan as a guy who would give you the shirt off his back and then go sign a law that repossessed it.) But its the underutilized Tea Leoni who really does steal it in a brief but juicy role as an FBI agent with a healthy extracurricular appetite. ""You have Steve McQueens Ferrari in your living room?"" she tells Shaw in disbelief. ""And here I thought you were an asshole""Ratner a producer-director best known for the hugely successful ""Rush Hour"" trilogy takes consistent abuse from comics fans for his near-destruction of a beloved franchise with ""X-Men The Last Stand"" and Im struggling to find something contrarian to say in response. I suspect that Ratners substantial personal fortune and no-doubt-beautiful Beverly Hills home help to soften the pain. Lets try this Hes a highly capable showman who knows how to balance action and comedy in ways that gratify an enormous audience. ""Tower Heist"" goes down pretty smooth if you absolutely positively dont think about it. Were supposed to believe that Stillers character Josh Kovacs still lives in his old Queens neighborhood despite managing a luxurious condo tower on Manhattans Columbus Circle (yeah it actually is Trump Tower although the filmmakers have deleted the name) a job that would easily pay 150000 or more. This way he still knows the cheerfully disreputable Slide a local hustler who favors do rags and gold chains played by Murphy with plenty of attitude and minimal redeeming characteristics. You Might Also Like Its nice to see Murphy come fairly close to cutting loose in a movie again even if Slide is kind of a generic hoodlum who rates about a B-minus on the scale of funny Murphy characters. At his best hes never hesitated to walk the knife-edge of racial stereotype playing black people who exemplify all kinds of socially undesirable characteristics and making them seem real. Slide is neither a moral nor an ethical guy but hes a genuine crackup and hes looking out for No. 1 which is the prime directive of American life handed down by our forefathers. Most of the time of course Murphy doesnt appear to give a damn and hasnt for years. Here are his non-""Shrek"" roles of the 21st century ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" ""Showtime"" (opposite Robert De Niro) ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" ""I Spy"" ""Daddy Day Care"" ""The Haunted Mansion"" ""Dreamgirls"" ""Norbit"" ""Meet Dave"" and ""Imagine That."" It isnt just that theres maybe 1.4 worthwhile movies and a whole bunch of rock-sucking on that list; I had to look them up to confirm that they existed (and to remind myself that in many cases I personally saw them and cant remember them).I went into this thinking that Ben Stiller was in a similar position of Focker-tized middle-aged stardom but while hes made many terrible movies theres really no comparison. I didnt personally find the ""Night at the Museum"" series all that hysterical but the marketplace disagrees with me as it does on the vastly more awful Focker franchise. But Stiller understands the value of mixing it up; he was very good (in a teeth-grating way) in Noah Baumbachs ""Greenberg"" and is making another film with Baumbach now. He also seems devoted to mocking his own celebrity in a way that obviously doesnt work for the more introverted Murphy appearing as ""Ben Stiller"" in numerous films and TV series all the way back to a 1998 episode of ""Dr. Katz Professional Therapist."" He clearly works all the damn time which is pretty much the opposite problem from Eddie Murphy and makes dismal memories like ""Starsky amp; Hutch"" or ""The Heartbreak Kid"" fade away much more easily. (I do regret the fact that Stiller seems to have visited Ray Liottas cosmetic surgeon.) ""Tower Heist"" is funny in the way of so many Hollywood comedies meaning that individual scenes are often crisply written and played but the whole doesnt add up to anything. Shaw is a schmuck whos going to get away with massive fraud so Josh and his co-workers with Slides so-called help launch a crack-brained scheme to rip him off despite their evident unsuitability for such a task. You dont want me to deliver a lecture about how the only kind of redress a movie like this can imagine for injustice is individual and material in nature rather than social or collective do you? Didnt think so. Theres a deliciously silly conversation about movies and another one about ""running a gauntlet of lesbians"" and some nice stunt work involving the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade (which Ratner actually restaged for the film balloons and all). ""Tower Heist"" will stick in your mind much better than any other recent Eddie Murphy film which is to say that a month from now youll still sort of remember it. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Like the scheming protagonists in the slick caper Tower Heist the films creators had some big plans that didnt exactly work out. The film was first pitched as a black Oceans Eleven that would pair producer/star Eddie Murphy with a whos-who of black comic talent and climax with a heist involving Donald Trump and the Trump Tower. Then Ben Stiller came onboard the Trump element was abandoned and the film became a crowd-pleasing multiracial heist comedy co-starring Murphy. Then Universal announced it would make the film available on demand in two cities for 59.99 three weeks after its theatrical release only to nix those plans after outcry from theater owners. Alas the only thing revolutionary about Tower Heist is its botched pay-per-view distribution scheme; the film is otherwise defined by a puppyish eagerness to give viewers exactly what it imagines they want. Ben Stiller stars as the frighteningly efficient manager of an upscale high-rise building in the heart of Manhattan. Hes single-mindedly focused on his job until he discovers that the Bernie Madoff-like resident (Alan Alda) of the buildings penthouse suite has looted its employees pensions. He then sets about stealing some of the money back with the help of milquetoast businessman Matthew Broderick Jamaican maid/safecracker Gabourey Sidibe and a smartass career criminal played by Murphy. It would be a mistake to call Murphys performance a stretch since he played so many hustlers early in his career but the break from playing fathers and the morbidly obese invigorates him; he hasnt been this lively since Dreamgirls. Tower Heist gets off to a poky exposition-riddled start burdened with having to introduce a sprawling ensemble cast and their one defining characteristic apiece. It picks up for good once Murphy enters the picture halfway through and it benefits from some nice ensemble work but no thought or care seems to have gone into the heist at the movies core its a big dumb blunt instrument of a plan. In the end Tower Heist isnt a black Oceans Eleven or a bold leap forward for feature-film distribution just a passable piece of commercial entertainment that falls closer to product than art.

"Tower Heist | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; tower-heist ) Tower Heist (United States 2011) November 03 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Whether suffused with tension or laced with humor the heist movie has enjoyed enduring appeal since the heyday of film noir. Good heist movies proceed according to an established template that includes meticulous attention to the details of the scheme both in the planning stage and in its execution. The twists - there are often many but always at least one - are ingenious and the screenplay is often referred to as ""smart"" and ""cunning."" Unfortunately few (if any) of these characteristics apply to Brett Ratners Tower Heist as sloppy a heist movie as I can remember. It is redeemed at least to a degree by the comedic performances of lead actor Ben Stiller and supporting player Eddie Murphy. The pace emphasized by Christophe Becks relentless score is so fast that viewers might miss some of the king-sized plot holes (although not all of them). But the caper is a dud - so stupid and implausible from beginning to end that its impossible to take it seriously for even the briefest of moments. Ratners reputation is built primarily on the Rush Hour trilogy a series that overexposed the limited chemistry between Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. With Tower Heist Ratner attempts to mine a similar buddy film vein with Stiller and Murphy. However with everything else going on its impossible for this relationship to get off the ground - the two dont share enough screen time for it to work. The same can be said of the non-starter romance between Stiller and Tea Leoni. Ratner doesnt care about his characters - he just throws them on screen mixes them up and hopes something works. For the most part it doesnt. The action centers around The Tower an exclusive high rise Manhattan residence building where apartments start at 5 million. Occupying the penthouse with its tremendous view and rooftop swimming pool is multi-millionaire Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) a crook cast in the mold of Bernie Madoff. Shaws every whim is catered to by The Towers staff including the concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck); the elevator operator Enrique (Michael Pena); the doorman Lester (Stephen McKinley Henderson); and their boss Josh (Ben Stiller). Then the bombshell lands dropped by FBI Special Agent Claire Denham (Tea Leoni) Shaw has been indicted on multiple counts of fraud. His entire portfolio was a scam and all the money invested with him - including the pension fund of The Towers workers - is gone. Joshs solution with the help of a small-time thief named Slide (Eddie Murphy) theyll break into Shaws hidden safe and recover the money he has stolen from them. To do so requires that they circumvent The Towers high-tech security systems elude the FBI and find and crack the safe. Things become more difficult when Josh Enrique and Charlie are fired and barred entrance to the building. The biggest disappointment with Tower Heist is how dumb the screenplay is. The big ""twist"" is pedestrian and the centerpiece sequence involving a Ferarri dangling from a cable hundreds of feet in the air is neither ingenious nor exciting. The caper as a whole is not well designed and the specifics are so threadbare that much of what happens toward the end makes little sense. This is a sadly common example of a filmmaker designing his production for inattentive lazy audiences who dont really care about story coherence or consistency. Its a ""turn off the brain"" movie. Stiller and Murphy have been funnier in other movies but they bring a badly needed sense of levity to the proceedings and each is good for at least a few good laughs. Alan Alda is particularly good as the silver-tongued bad guy. Hes like grandpa with a bad attitude and one gets the sense he spent some time studying video of Madoff before embarking upon the portrayal. No one else makes much of an impression existing as they do more as background decoration than genuine characters. Tower Heist was originally intended to be the first of a ""great experiment"" embarked upon by Universal Pictures. The plan was to open the movie theatrically on November 4 2011 then make it available for pay-per-view three weeks later (Thanksgiving weekend) at the astounding price of about 60. When multiplexes mutinied Universal scrapped the idea which is a good thing for potential movie-goers. At 10 per ticket this movie represents robbery. At 60 per purchase the title would be richly deserved.

With Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy. Director Brett Ratner (144). PG-13 language sexuality violence. At area theaters. Isnt it time for some enterprising studio publicist to set up a movie screen at Zuccotti Park? First ""Margin Call"" exposed the dark night of a financiers soul and now ""Tower Heist"" offers wish fulfillment for anyone outraged by the evil greed of Bernie Madoff. In other words for anyone who isnt Bernie Madoff. Brett Ratners caper comedy is shameless in its pandering setting a selfishly elitist businessman against ""the help"" who work in his fancy upper West Side condo. From left Matthew Broderick Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy in Tower Heist (Credit Universal Pictures/) But ""Tower Heist"" also boasts an unusually strong cast of actors who boost the slick screenplay into a satisfying popcorn picture. Our not-quite-fearless leader is Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) the meticulous manager of New Yorks toniest building The Tower (actually Columbus Circles Trump International Hotel and Tower). When billionaire penthouse resident Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is arrested for massive fraud Josh has to tell his staff the bad news their pensions disappeared in Shaws Ponzi scheme. From left Matthew Broderick Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy in Tower Heist (Credit Universal Pictures/) But at the unwitting suggestion of the arresting FBI agent (Tea Leoni) Josh believes he can get everyones money back. He knows where Shaw installed a hidden safe which a few accomplished thieves might be able to open. Unfortunately Joshs backup team consists of his dopey brother-in-law (Casey Affleck) an attitudinal housekeeper (Gabourey Sidibe) the clueless elevator operator (Michael Pena) and an uptight banker (Matthew Broderick). On the bright side a professional crook (Eddie Murphy) is also willing to offer his services given sufficient motivation. From left Matthew Broderick Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy in Tower Heist (Credit David Lee/) Ratners filmmaking choices -- unnecessary exposition shoddy edits dangling plot points -- often come across as arrogant. Its as if he knows well be entertained so he doesnt have to worry about the details. The script by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson isnt strong enough to cover the careless direction. But the crackerjack cast is. Alda balances Ratners broader tendencies making Shaw a human rather than cartoonish villain. Stillers generous performance as the straight man holds the film together while allowing his castmates to grab most of the laughs. All earn their share. But its really Murphy finally fully engaged who makes this adventure worth our while. Lit with the same comic energy that propelled the star through ""48 Hrs."" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" his fast-talking grifter doesnt just steal scenes; he walks off with the entire movie.

Eric Kohn Nov 3 2011 213 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Its harder to imagine a meatier -- and more wasted -- ensemble than what Brett Ratner has at his disposal in ""Tower Heist."" In theory what we have here is a potentially entertaining payback story about blue-collar New Yorkers who unite against the affluent resident (Alan Alda) of a Manhattan high-rise plotting to steal his riches back after he destroys their earnings with a Ponzi scheme. Its only a mild spoiler to mention that they get the job done. But the real theft involves moviegoers wallets which are bound to open up this weekend in hopes of it being a better movie. The release of ""Tower Heist"" on Friday puts Ratners Hollywood domination in focus and creates the opportunity to consider some alternatives. Led by committed building manager Josh (Ben Stiller) the staff in ""Tower Heist"" includes several generations of name talent Michael Pena Casey Affleck and Gabourey Sidibe bring the youth contingency Stiller and Matthew Broderick round out the fortysomethings and Eddie Murphy (who turned 50 in April) looms just above them as the shifty thief Josh hires to help with the heist. Tea Leoni plays an aggressive FBI agent simultaneously committed to taking down Aldas character while inexplicably falling for Joshs off-putting charms. Among the grey-haired veterans Alda has company from Judd Hirsch in a minor role. These are actors who could take a glass of water and make it funny charming or profound at will if the material allows. ""Tower Heist"" mostly holds down such possibilities with a plot lifted from ""Oceans Eleven"" and only occasionally enlivened by the build-up to the big finale. There is a certain large-scale Hollywood charm mainly in the cockamamie action sequences; among these a climax set during Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade features the same goofy slapstick and daring stuntwork that made Ratners ""Rush Hour"" franchise a blockbuster hit. Still ""Tower Heist"" fails to become anything more than a mild guilty pleasure -- the modus operandi of Ratners oeuvre. Ratner supposedly chose Murphy to host the Oscars after making this film but the movie feels like an audition for the job. To be fair Ratner has made worse movies equally poised for major box office returns but nothing matches the smugness on display here. While mildly funny at times the plot is wildly inconsistent at first treasuring the workers struggles and then just celebrating the art of the steal. In theory and for some parts of its solid first act ""Tower Heist"" taps into the zeitgeist by channeling the rage currently epitomized by the Occupy Wall Street. Those seeking a more perceptive look at the battles of less fortunate and unemployed members of society should look no further than ""Take Shelter"" Jeff Nichols startling parable in which Michael Shannon plays a broke family man plagued by visions of the apocalypse. Shannons phenomenal performance perfectly evokes the sense of confusion that accompanies any personal crisis economic or otherwise -- although unlike ""Tower Heist"" its not remotely funny. For that outlet however theres another cure Finnish director Aki Kaurismakis deadpan near-masterpiece ""Le Havre"" also out now harkens back to his 1980s-era ""Proletariat Trilogy"" with an alternately poignant and cheery adventure about an aging shoe shiner committed to helping a young illegal immigrant evade the police. Kaurismakis sympathy for sad alienated men and women from working-class backgrounds makes his filmmaking more relevant than ever before. Of course some audiences would rather go to the movies to forget about these things and ""Tower Heist"" gives them the option of pretending that a happy ending is around every corner. Ratners film enables that delusion but theres a superior ensemble piece currently in theaters that dismantles it. ""Margin Call"" is a chronicle of the financial collapse almost entirely set in a single office. The cast features a half dozen first-rate performances from a similarly broad spectrum from Zachary Quinto to Kevin Spacey. With its morbid portrayal of a corrupt investment bank on the brink of screwing over its clients ""Margin Call"" puts a chilling face on corporate greed. Its not a whole lot better than ""Tower Heist"" but at least somewhat closer to the truth.

Not only are the spectacles so unnecessarily dull who cares that a big object is dangling from a tall object (spoilers avoided) especially when theres no fun in explaining how no one noticed said big object. Ditto with everything involving said big object. That someone many people got paid oodles to craft such a bland story -- lazy jokes written by commmittee does not entertainment make. I hope too that audiences notice the self-serving ending -- others the audience for instance are not saved by the heroes; only those with wit to outwit and their friends are saved.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures David Lee) Between them Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy and director Brett Ratner have generated about 6 billion in box-office revenue -- and about six cents worth of critical acclaim. Stiller is still bankable barely but Murphy has spent a decade in daddy day care and Ratner has been stalled in traffic since ""Rush Hour."" Yet even by the declining standards of these repeat offenders ""Tower Heist"" is a rip-off.Back when it was planned as an African-American ""Oceans Eleven"" this project might have been edgy but the script has been whitewashed into a generic caper comedy with pretensions of timeliness.Stiller (in the role presumably intended for Chris Rock) plays Josh Kovacs the multitasking manager of a luxury high-rise in Manhattan. After mogul Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) is arrested for a Madoff-style investment scam that drains the pensions of the employees Josh vows to get even. No not by occupying Wall Street but by staging a heist of the millions that FBI agent Claire Denham (Tea Leoni) believes that Shaw stashed in his penthouse apartment. But after Josh concierge/brother-in-law Charlie (Casey Affleck) and elevator operator Enrique (Michael Pena) are fired for going ballistic on Shaws priceless Ferrari the gang must recruit some new blood. At opposite ends of the criminality spectrum are bankrupt broker Mr. Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) and a streetwise thief called Slide (Murphy). Somewhere in the middle is Jamaican housemaid Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe) who just happens to be a safecracker.On the most basic level of plot mechanics ""Tower Heist"" is dull and nonsensical as the gang must smuggle some hidden treasure down an elevator shaft while two members of the motley crew go rogue. And its not very funny even with a slapstick springboard like the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade waiting to be leveraged. The surprising exception is Murphy who produced the movie and made sure he had some motor-mouth monologues to remind us of ""48 Hours.""

"Tower Heist movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Tower Heist Comedy of comeuppanceCast that includes Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller and Matthew Broderick cashes in via 70s-style crime caper -- 3 starsNovember 03 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticBen Stiller and Eddie Murphy star in ""Tower Heist.""Forty-five minutes or so into ""Tower Heist"" the question arises Is this movie with the title of purest generica -- was ""Stealing Money"" taken? -- truly good or simply less bad than most of what director Brett Ratner has done previously? The improbable answer is A. For what it is -- recessionary wish-fulfillment escapism with a lot of highly skilled familiar faces in its amply qualified cast -- its fun. The humors not subtle; a lot of its misogynous and fairly coarse. But the script by Ted Griffin (""Oceans Eleven"") and Jeff Nathanson (""Catch Me If You Can"") doesnt make the usual action comedy mistake of piling on the action at the expense of the comedy. Recently tapped as producer of the Academy Awards telecast to be hosted by ""Tower Heist"" co-star Eddie Murphy Ratner made his pile on the ""Rush Hour"" franchise and by directing the third (and drecky) ""X-Men"" film. With ""Tower Heist"" he takes his cue from the atmosphere and vibe of various beloved 1970s heist pictures among them the original ""The Taking of Pelham 123."" Certainly Ratners composer Christophe Beck has studied that films David Shire score The funky bass lines and trumpet blasts here keep announcing big bad doings in Manhattan. Played by the Trump Tower just off Columbus Circle across from Central Park the luxe high-rise of ""Tower Heist"" is home to a Wall Street tycoon (Alan Alda) whose ethics recall Bernie Madoffs. Hes entrusted by building manager Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) to handle the employees pensions. Poof Pensions be gone. Political connections favor the tycoon getting away with his 2 billion crime spree a portion of which represents the staffs life savings. Its up to Kovacs with the aid of semi-pro burglar and fellow Queens resident Slide (Murphy) to locate and swipe a missing 20 million hidden somewhere in the tycoons penthouse the centerpiece of which is a beautifully maintained classic Ferrari once owned by Steve McQueen. The promotional imagery for ""Tower Heist"" does not hide the sequences involving the Ferrari dangling from a cable outside the building while down below the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade proceeds along Central Park West. Compared with the outsized chaos of the ""Rush Hour"" sequels though Ratners latest has a pleasing sense of scale. The film actors such as Matthew Broderick (as a sad-sack Wall Street victim) Michael Pena (as a newly hired bellhop) Casey Affleck (whose droll line readings as the concierge are consistently surprising) and Gabourey ""Precious"" Sidibe (as a safecracking maid). I wouldnt say that producer and co-star Murphy is slumming here exactly but it is too bad the superstar who ruled the world with such savvy commercial entertainments as the first ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and the first ""48 HRS"" doesnt get a little more elbow room. Likewise the splendid Tea Leoni in the role of an FBI agent is allowed just enough screen time to remind you shes not getting the screen time she deserves. Murphys key early byplay with Stiller -- when the building manager explains the heist plan -- ends with a simple quick ""Lets go get something to eat"" Note Thats not a funny line. But Murphys delivery is hugely so. The sleek and efficient ""Tower Heist"" was made for one reason only Its all about the Benjamins. No doubt producer Murphy will arrange for co-star Murphy to have more to do in ""Tower Heist 2."" mjphillipstribune.com Tower Heist -- 3 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for language and sexual content) Cast Ben Stiller (Josh Kovacs); Eddie Murphy (Slide); Casey Affleck (Charlie); Alan Alda (Arthur Shaw); Matthew Broderick (Fitzhugh); Stephen McKinley Henderson (Lester); Judd Hirsch (Simon); Tea Leoni (Claire Denham); Michael Pena (Enrique DevReaux); Gabourey Sidibe (Odessa) Credits Directed by Brett Ratner; written by Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson; produced by Brian Grazer Eddie Murphy and Kim Roth.

The aesthetic pairing of The Donald and director Brett Ratner is a natural. This brassy production an imitation Oceans 131/2 features the name-brand talents of Ben Stiller (as an honorable Tower manager named Josh) and Eddie Murphy (as a con man called Slide) leading rookie thieves in an elaborate Robin Hood-style heist. Their target? The oversize penthouse of one Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) a shady billionaire who keeps a rare 1963 Ferrari in his living room. In other words Tower Heist is the cinematic version of a Trump property overblinged eye-catching and essentially tacky. For a movie that claims its heart is with the masses -- the 99 percent -- theres an awful lot of production-design admiration lavished on the trappings of the effing-rich 1 percent. (Ratner had specific ideas about which pedigreed modern-art reproductions he wanted on the walls.) Shaw is a fictional variation on Bernie Madoff Entrusted with the retirement savings of the multicultural low-wage employees who keep the Tower running he takes their money and ruins their lives. And so rallied by egalitarian friend-to-all Josh -- the guy takes the subway to work from Queens so you know hes a mensch -- and hastily educated in criminal technique by Joshs less honorable Queens neighbor Slide these blue-collar little people rise up in triumph to steal their money back. By the moral standards of Occupy Hollywood the crime earns an ethical thumbs-up. You may think I am picking too much on whats built to be a fun diverting New York-state-of-mind caper comedy -- a joke-filled cavalcade that marks 50-year-old Eddie Murphys welcome return to the edgier stuff that made him famous. Alrighty lets talk about Murphy Hes nowhere to be found in the first half of the movie And hes only there to illuminate selected scenes in the second Hes like the spot lighting supplied by a big-ass chandelier in an ostentatious Trump lobby. Thats too bad because when Murphy is on screen his comedic vigor -- reminiscent of Chris Tuckers jive-talk mania in Ratners Rush Hour movies but with a blast of Murphy-specific danger -- gooses the movies energy level. Ive missed that guy. But whenever Murphy wanders off the movies pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies One belongs to Murphy the other to the rest of the cast. Joshs drippy in-house recruits include Matthew Broderick as a broke ex-Wall Streeter and Tower resident (and the kind of fretful nebbish he perfected on Broadway in The Producers); Michael Pena as an uncouth rookie bellhop; and Oceans alumnus Casey Affleck as an unreliable concierge who happens to be Joshs stressed-out brother-in-law. (The band of gentlemen credited with the story and screenplay includes Ted Griffin who worked on Steven Soderberghs 2001 Oceans Eleven.) Two female characters also join the increasingly frantic male-driven mayhem. (Heres where I mention with an eye roll that in what I hope is a quickly passing trend in male- as well as female-driven comedies vaginas are briefly discussed this time by Affleck.) Tea Leoni who worked with the director 11 years ago in The Family Man gamely plays a no-nonsense FBI agent with cute rough edges. And Gabourey Sidibe the striking plus-size Oscar-nominated star of Precious makes her Hollywood leap as a feisty Jamaican chambermaid who gets in on the heist action. (The girls got mad safecracking skills.) I dont know why Ratner and cinematographer Dante Spinotti felt compelled to push the camera in close as if gawking at Sidibes dramatic coloring and size. But then I also dont know why she wasnt used more Murphy never looks more alive and excited by a fellow actor -- challenged to peak performance -- than during ribald flirtatious banter with Sidibes self-possessed working girl. Shes something new; Murphy in Tower Heist is something rebooted. Together they build something with more visual interest than any Trump Tower on any tourist map.

Tower Heist Fair to good Director Brett Ratner Starring Eddie Murphy Ben Stiller and Casey Affleck Rating PG-13 for language and sexual content. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Ben Stiller Spotlight Eddie Murphy Heist movies That may seem like a strange thing to say about ""Tower Heist"" a ridiculous fun and funny caper film that is very much an ensemble piece with Ben Stiller Casey Affleck Matthew Broderick Michael Pena Gabourey Sidibe and Tea Leoni sharing in the comedic spoils. Its a ludicrous story somewhat grounded in the raw feelings about the state of the economy in which workers at an exclusive New York apartment high-rise seek to steal back at least some of the money from a Bernie Madoff-like figure (Alan Alda) who swindled them. Theyre all good but you cant help leaving the film with the following thought Man its good to see Murphy being funny again. Murphy the one-time ""Saturday Night Live"" golden child (pun intended) who was so terrific in movies like ""48 Hours"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop"" whose preening confidence was such an essential ingredient in his comedy has been lying fallow for years now in kid movies and ridiculous fare like ""Norbit."" Here in a Brett Ratner movie of all things -- the director responsible for the ""Rush Hour"" movies -- Murphy makes a welcome return to form. Honestly its nice just to hear him curse again. Josh Kovacs (Stiller) is the manager of The Tower an exclusive Manhattan address for the likes of its owner Arthur Shaw (Alda) who opens the movie swimming in his pool -- with a giant 100 bill painted on its floor -- atop the high-rise. Shaw is charming but lethal chummy with people like Enrique (Pena) who seeks a job as an elevator operator yet never letting anyone forget who runs the joint. But the Feds swoop in on Shaw and charge him with securities fraud. It seems he has been defrauding his clients which include most of the employees of The Tower whose pensions hes raided. When even the loyal Josh is convinced of his boss guilt he first takes a golf club to Shaws beloved sports car -- Steve McQueens Ferrari parked in the middle of the living room -- managing to get himself Enrique and Charlie (Affleck) the concierge fired in the process although his anger does impress FBI agent Claire Denham (Leoni). Then Josh devises a plan for the newly unemployed trio plus former stockbroker and evicted Tower resident Mr. Fitzhugh (Broderick) to steal the 20 million the FBI thinks Shaw has stashed away somewhere. The problem is this isnt exactly Danny Ocean and his cohorts so Josh brings in former childhood friend and current low-level criminal Slide (Murphy) to help. Slide may not be the top-flight criminal mind he purports to be -- they have to call in Tower employee Odessa (Sidibe) because he cant crack a safe -- but as played by Murphy he is reliably hilarious. Why has it taken so long for this to happen again? Maybe ""Dr. Doolittle"" checks are sizable who knows? Whatever the case Slide and Josh work out a plan that involves French Playboy a fake court date and the Snoopy float in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. Its absurd and no one pretends any differently. The fun is in the interaction between the characters. A scene when Denham and Josh get drunk for instance -- Leoni is pretty swell (if underused). And Broderick is an unexpected delight as the utterly defeated Mr. Fitzhugh; nearly everything he says (""Im thinking of becoming a male prostitute"") is kind of pathetic but laugh-out-loud funny. With the Occupy Wall Street movement maintaining strength bad times are a good time for ""Tower Heist."" Its social commentary is superficial and its chops as a real caper film are suspect. But thanks to the cast especially Murphy and Broderick it is funny. And who couldnt use a laugh these days?

E-mail| Print| Text size - + ""Tower Heist"" is an ensemble and a strong one at that led by Ben Stiller Alan Alda Matthew Broderick Casey Affleck and Tea Leoni. But Brett Ratners blast of an action comedy truly brings out the best in Eddie Murphy something many of us may have forgotten even existed.Fast-talking flummoxed and full of false bravado Murphy gives a performance as a low-level thief that recalls his signature work in the movies that made him a superstar in the mid-1980s -- like ""48 Hours"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop."" When Murphys on screen in his classic comic mode its hard to focus on anyone or anything else. Its as if weve turned back time and erased all those family-friendly duds and lame laughers that required him to climb into yet another fat suit or talk to even more animals.""Tower Heist"" deflates a bit when Murphys not around but for the most part Ratners movie is slick and crowd-pleasing -- even more successfully so than his ""Rush Hour"" films -- and it couldnt be more relevant in exploring the disparity between the haves and have-nots. Following ""In Time"" this is the second week in a row with a new release that plays like ""Robin Hood"" for the Occupy Wall Street crowd.Stiller stars as Josh the longtime manager of a luxury high-rise in Manhattan; its actually the Trump International Hotel and Tower at Columbus Circle. When the financial guru who lives in the penthouse is charged with stealing billions from his investors -- including the hardworking tower staff -- Josh comes up with a plan to steal their money back. Alan Alda plays this Bernard Madoff figure with just the right mix of affability and sleaze.But Joshs accomplices a posse consisting of residents and employees played by Broderick Affleck Michael Pena and Gabourey Sidibe arent exactly up to the task. Theyve never stolen anything in their lives. The fact that Shaw is under house arrest complicates their plan further.So Josh enlists Murphys character Slide whom hes known since they were kids to give them some tips. Slide isnt nearly the criminal mastermind he professes himself to be but these guys dont know that; in one amusing montage he sends them out to shoplift random items at the mall just to prove they can rip off something.One of the genius elements of the script -- credited to Ted Griffin (""Oceans Eleven"") and Jeff Nathanson (""Catch Me If You Can"") -- is that it actually fleshes these characters out which makes you care about whether they can pull this thing off. And the vivid childhood memories Josh and Slide have of each other is a running joke that adds to the movies absurdity; Stiller is solid and hits just the right tone as the righteously indignant anchor at the center of this increasing mayhem.At the same time Josh strikes up an unlikely flirtation with the tough-as-nails FBI agent on the case played by Tea Leoni. She grew up in working-class Queens like Shaw and shes disgusted by the flashy swindler hes become. Leoni has one great scene in which her character gets drunk with Stillers and turns a little too forthcoming; its a great reminder of what a natural comedienne she is and it makes you want to see more of her.The heist itself is of course completely ridiculous but thats part of the point -- and part of the fun. Ratner keeps things moving so fluidly that youll probably just roll with it. And his film is lighted and shot so beautifully (the work of two-time Oscar-nominated cinematographer Dante Spinotti) and it feels so substantial in terms of production values you cant help but be drawn in. These feel like actual people doing actual stunts -- especially during the crime itself which takes place during the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade -- which sadly seems like a rarity in this age of computer-generated extravaganzas.""Tower Heist"" a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 for language and sexual content.

Make a Funny Movie Wednesday November 2 2011 at 4 a.m. By Nick Pinkerton A revenge of the have-nots playing on the clear class stratification of the luxury high-rise Tower Heist pits lobby against penthouse. Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) is the manager of The Tower an exclusive apartment building on Columbus Circle (the Trump International in fact). Joshs job is to know every peccadillo and predict every whim of his buildings pampered residents none of whose happiness is more important than that of the man on the top floor number 138 on the Forbes 400 investor Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who keeps Steve McQueens Ferrari in his living room. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - One day bringing charges of financial malfeasance the FBI comes for Shaw. The staffs astonishment turns to horror when Josh tells them that Shaw a board member at The Tower was managing all of their pensions which have now evaporated along with his fortune. Outraged and guilty Josh confronts Shaw only to get himself canned along with two co-workers the unqualified concierge Charlie (Casey Affleck) and a new hire Devreaux (Michael Pena). Joshs guts impress one of the agents assigned to Shaws case (Tea Leoni) who gives Josh the idea that Shaw must have an emergency flight fund stashed somewhere. So with his newly unemployed friends as well as Chase Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) a depressed ex-financier recently evicted from The Tower and Slide (Eddie Murphy) a thug childhood acquaintance whom Josh bails out of Rikers to act as a kind of criminal consultant Josh outlines a plan to break into the penthouse where Shaw has been put on house arrest and liberate the cash.The ripped-from-the-headlines service economy payback aspect of Tower Heist doesnt warrant too much thought. Director Brett Ratner is a student of 80s action-comedy blockbusters with their easy abandonment of plausible character whenever it stands in the way of a big scene--there is a bit here where a kindly old man plows a truck into the Macys Day Parade that makes no sense whatsoever--and their topically hiss-worthy villainy. The Russians are out of season; Wall Street will do just as nicely.As a heist movie Tower Heist is as amateur as its crooks The audience isnt even fully aware of whos in on the job when it kicks off while other threads are left dangling--the intimate knowledge that Josh boasts of The Towers residents never actually comes into play. (There is however a well-handled process-oriented sequence that occurs during the heist which involves improvising a way to get a large crazy-unwieldy piece of loot from the penthouse to the street which makes striking use of the buildings vertiginous height.) The heist film is traditionally the most craftsmanlike directors-movie genre much given to blueprints precise planning and stopwatch-timed rehearsal coaching the viewer on whats to be done at every stage. Here the scenes where youd usually be getting drilled on the plan of action are all about round-table riffing not architectural filmmaking. This slapdash gang cant even stay on topic--Joshs PowerPoint slideshow digresses into a bull session about female anatomy with inspired contributions from Murphy.More than the marquee names the second bananas keep the movie bobbing along Brodericks pharmaceutically vague hangdog act is perfect (""If you need me Ill be living in this box"") while Pena turns out to be a fine comedian an enthusiastically yipping dumb puppy here. Scene-for-scene though Leoni is the best thing going Her blue-collar deadpan rings truer than Stillers; they have a boozing scene together that she ends by flipping a spray of bills onto the tabletop straightening from a drunken totter to do a neat little girlish hop over a step-down on her way toward the door. Tower Heist earns a viewers goodwill with these little comic flicks of the wrist when signing out of scenes accents that tend to go over bigger than the bolded punchlines. (The script credited to Ted Griffin and frequent Ratner collaborator Jeff Nathanson has lived through a hundred rewrites including an alleged Noah Baumbach polish.)An affable crowd-pleasing director with his hugely successful Rush Hour franchise Ratner is at times near to crowd-pandering here. But Tower Heist deserves credit as a clean well-turned job fleet and funny and inconsequential. It gets in and gets out quickly. . . . and leaves no trace once its gone.1 Stiller and Murphy bringing 80s action-comedy to the 21st century.David Lee Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

The tower in question overlooks New Yorks Central Park and hosts serviced apartments where uniformed staff tend to super-wealthy residents - among them deliciously slippery Alan Alda as an investment kingpin whose arrest on fraud charges brings the shock that hes lost the staff pension fund entrusted to him by likeably harrassed manager Ben Stiller. As the title suggests the workers strike back not by pitching tents in the lobby but attempting to nab Aldas stash from his penthouse pad. Hence theres mild underdogs-on-a-mission japery a cliched assist from career-crook Eddie Murphy and a finale which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously. Still thats the price of unashamed escapism and though its hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations its equally hard to dislike.

Further evidence that the working class is sharpening its pitchforks to storm Wall Streets castle ""Tower Heist"" serves up an old-fashioned comedy caper in which employees in a tony residential high-rise scheme to steal back the millions embezzled by the Bernie Madoff-style fat cat living in the buildings penthouse. But the big-budget pic goes wonky on the way to the bank due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks -- namely laughs. Still their involvement should help protect Universals investment ensuring decent returns into the holidays. In a heist movie the less time spent on setup the better. But helmer Brett Ratner whose unapologetically broad yet super-slick entertainments have previously demonstrated a keen sense of what auds want instead draws out the setup. Smitten with the building (Trump Tower but never identified as such) he deliberately establishes each of the characters from smug billionaire Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda perfectly cast) to dutiful building manager Josh Kovaks (Stiller) who admires Shaw and takes his job incredibly seriously -- until he learns that the Towers top-floor tenant pocketed the staffs retirement savings. The script credited to five writers patiently waits for disillusion to sink in trickling down through the building and its personnel which include a clueless expectant-father concierge (Casey Affleck) a bankrupt investor (Matthew Broderick) and a devastated old doorman (Stephen McKinley Henderson) who tries to step in front of a subway train when he learns what became of his nest egg. The film also supplies a first-day-on-the-job bellhop (Michael Pena) whose arrival allows for a remedial tour of the Towers security operations which sound complicated but dont really impact the heist in any way. For the first 40 minutes or so the pic plays like a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes none more outrageous than Murphy who appears on Joshs way to and from work wearing a do-rag and shouting at his girlfriend in the street -- a welcome return to the comics irreverent 80s-era persona. Sadly Murphy who reportedly hatched the project as an all-black answer to the ""Oceans Eleven"" series isnt in the movie much. By the time his idea reached the screen it had been rethought to such a degree that Murphy now finds himself the only black character in the initial crew enlisted because ""hes been arrested a bunch of times."" The gang later recruits a Jamaican safe-cracking maid played by ""Precious"" star Gabourey Sidibe who gives Murphy a chance to squirm under her sexual advances (hilarious) and fend off fat jokes (not so much). Once the wheels finally start to turn on Joshs plan to steal back the money Shaw embezzled ""Tower Heist"" picks up some much-needed momentum. Ratner finds himself on firmer ground in such familiar genre territory having previously done some of his best work on little-seen heist movie ""After the Sunset"" which recognized that the only thing more entertaining than actually nabbing a multimillion-dollar prize is trying to get away with it. ""Tower Heist"" spends the rest of its running time tracking the crew as they try to infiltrate Shaws penthouse locate his hidden millions and when that fails make off with the prized 1963 Ferrari he keeps parked in his living room. But the consequences get short shrift -- a strange choice after having introduced Tea Leoni as a sympathetic FBI agent who agrees to go out with Josh the Saturday after the heist is planned. The resolution feels rushed especially as concerns Stillers character; the actor so good at playing annoyed might have been better used trying to thwart the heist from within rather than leading it. A subplot in which Josh and Shaw play computer chess suggests theres a battle-of-the-wits aspect to the caper though the most entertaining bits showcase the ensemble at their most clueless as when Murphy tests his amateur cohorts by daring them to steal 50 worth of merchandise from the mall -- the scene that best fosters genuine identification with these buffoons. During the heist itself the suspense is palpable if only because Christophe Becks funky score blares its horns so insistently one cant help but feel anxious. But the laughs dont follow squandering such set pieces as Broderick dangling from the bumper of a sports car suspended 50-odd stories above New Yorks annual Thanksgiving Day Parade without the madcap hilarity -- or gimme golden-parachute jokes -- they so richly deserve.

TWITTER Brett Ratners comic caper about coworkers who turn the tables on a Bernie Madoff type is a smoothly engineered crowd pleaser. Tower Heist spins on a crackerjack premise thats played for broad entertainment value rather than real interest in the contemporary economic issues at its core. Brett Ratners comic caper about a bunch of co-workers who turn the tables on a Bernie Madoff type who has swindled them out of their pensions is snappy well cast and streetwise in a well-upholstered New York sort of way and it is peppered with smart-mouthed sass much of it supplied by Eddie Murphy. This smoothly engineered crowd-pleaser should fulfill its function just fine through Thanksgiving and beyond. A whole different film with the same plot and cast of characters could have been made that would have mined the raw grievances of people who have been cheated or otherwise lost their jobs or life savings in the wake of the money troubles of the past three years. It could still even have been a comedy. But Ratner and screenwriters Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson use the financial mayhem as a plot trigger for an elaborate scheme that however far-fetched is all but irresistible in its criminal legitimacy and its promise for just desserts. The opening shot is a stunner a view straight down at Ben Franklins 100 face gracing the bottom of the swimming pool atop the Tower Manhattans most expensive residential spire (played by Trump Tower Columbus Circle formerly the Gulf + Western Building). Out of it emerges Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) the self-satisfied Tower owner and investment king known for the handsome returns he always delivers to his clientele. THR COVER STORY Ben Stiller Reveals What He Thinks of Tower Heist Co-Star Eddie Murphy Hosting the Oscars The melting pot of supporting characters swings into view with the speed of passengers bounding off a carousel. Building GM Josh Kovacs (Ben Stiller) who enjoys complicity with Shaw based on their shared Astoria working-class roots runs the facility like a cool ships captain monitoring the innumerable employees catering to the privileged residents and keeping an eye on comings and goings via a battery of video screens. During the course of a few minutes hes obliged to hire enthusiastic job applicant Enrique (Michael Pena) and to try to evict once-successful stockbroker Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) whose condo is in foreclosure. Then theres front-desk clerk Charlie (Casey Affleck) whose wife is about to give birth and Lester (Stephen McKinley Henderson) the beloved veteran doorman who announces hell be hanging up his cap in a years time. But his retirement is contingent on his ship coming in; Lester like many others has given his life savings to the venerable Shaw who this day is nailed by the Feds led by Special Agent Claire Denham (Tea Leoni) and charged with securities fraud. It falls to Josh to inform the staff that their pensions have been wiped out. After he Enrique and Charlie go to Shaws penthouse and Josh takes a golf club to Shaws cherry-red Ferrari -- parked where a grand piano normally might be -- the three musketeers are fired. STORY Universal Backs Off Tower Heist Premium VOD Test Heist threatens to become serious only for a minute when Lester despairing he has worked his whole life for nothing appears ready to throw himself under a subway train. But thats no fun so instead attention turns to the FBI agent drunkenly revealing to Josh in a bar that Shaw has 20 million stashed away. Intimately acquainted as he is with the Tower Josh thinks he knows precisely where the loot is so after he reconvenes his trusted crew he feels the need to recruit a real criminal Slide (Murphy) to help pull off the job. With Murphys full entrance at the 40-minute mark the films energy and amusement level kick up a few notches at least for a while. This is the rude confrontational wiseass Murphy audiences have nearly forgotten after all the silly kid comedies and heavy-makeup outings of recent years. Sprung from prison to teach the neophytes a thing or two about crime Slide takes charge in one funny scene forcing each to shoplift something to prove their own worth. But he must admit he cant crack the relevant safe a job that then goes to another screwed-over Tower worker the Jamaican Odessa (Gabourey Sidibe). During the middle stretch when Murphy rules the roost the film is in good hands. Once the break-in is underway -- during the Macys Thanksgiving Day parade no less -- the enjoyment slips for several reasons Murphy becomes neutered the comedy ebbs and the logistics of the heist become too far-fetched and laborious. Without becoming utterly serious if the filmmakers had been able to embody in the climax the sense of outrage and injustice inherent in the films premise they really would have had something. As it is theres inevitable satisfaction with the result but its glib more connected to genre expectations than to anything real. But Heist shot sharply by Dante Spinotti and goosed by a zippy score from Christophe Beck does remind that it has been a long time -- since the 1970s really -- that this sort of star-laden caper film was in fashion the Oceansmovies being notable exceptions. Ratner pulls it off with relish and amiable levity even if a greater sense of BSing among the actors would have lifted things higher; when big girl Sidibe (Precious) begins coming on to Murphy after she joins the crew one hopes for more of this as hes great in comic-panic mode. Broderick has some effective low-key humorous moments but Pena and Affleck dont operate on the same comic plane as Stiller and Murphy creating a minor imbalance. As the financial titan Alda perfectly hits the desired note of brazen confidence in the mans untouchability. For Stillers part he effectively plays the straight man the organizer whose sense of justice and righting a huge wrong drives the operation. Just a bit more layering in the writing of his character giving Josh a bottom might have provided the heft to give the film weight. But a good time it is all the same.

By Anthony Lane Payback Eddie Murphy Alan Alda and Ben Stiller.   Credit Illustration by Kirsten Ulve At the risk of invoking Freud you have to wonder why movie stars are attracted to big long films about towers. ""The Towering Inferno"" had Steve McQueen Paul Newman Faye Dunaway and William Holden; it also had Fred Astaire and O. J. Simpson a pairing so exquisite that Luis Bunuel must have wished hed thought of it first. Now we have ""Tower Heist"" which features Ben Stiller Eddie Murphy Alan Alda Casey Affleck Tea Leoni Matthew Broderick and Judd Hirsch. None of these I concede are up there with Fred Astaire but then who is? What counts is safety in numbers--actors mustering together to lend bulk and momentum to a tale that they know to be dumb. The difference is that in 1974 they got away with it. The director of the new film is Brett Ratner previously responsible for the ""Rush Hour"" trilogy. The origins of his style are unclear but the influence of say early Fellini is less easy to detect than that of Cuisinart. Toss everything you can find starting with roughly diced plots into the blender press ""Pulse"" and pray such appears to be the method behind ""Tower Heist."" Stiller plays Josh Kovacs the building manager of the Tower a Trump-flavored pile of high-end apartments on Central Park West. The wise guy in the penthouse is Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda) who helps the Towers staff members invest their savings in a pension fund scrupulously following the edicts of a philosopher named Ponzi. When Kovacs and his colleagues discover that Shaw has swindled them they plan their revenge. If you can call it a plan. Few things are more foolishly satisfying than a good heist movie but unless the heisters are seen to devise their great day with precision everything slumps and so it proves with Ratner on the case. The climax of the crime shows a luscious old Ferrari being dangled from the Towers roof while down below a giant Snoopy floats by in the Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade. Although its a pleasingly brazen image you can imagine Ratners command to his team of writers (three of them are credited with the story and two with the screenplay) ""Get me to the car-dangle. I dont care how. Just get me there."" No audience objects to suspending its disbelief but we do expect something in return and the films refusal of all known logic has the tang of both indolence and insult. How can our heroes be sure of sneaking past security? Because everyone in security will rush outside to gaze up at Snoopy thats how. Good grief Charlie Brown. None of this is fair to the director of photography Dante Spinotti who shot ""The Last of the Mohicans"" ""Heat"" and ""L.A. Confidential"" and who kicks off ""Tower Heist"" with a dazzling shot of the eyes of Benjamin Franklin. Pull back and it turns into a vast hundred-dollar bill painted on the bottom of Shaws swimming pool atop the Tower. Nothing else is as loaded as that image which makes you ask what Spinotti might have delivered in tandem with a wiser or angrier director. The notion of a theft from the thieves--from those who are lapped in lofty screw-you wealth--is a tempting one right now but ""Tower Heist"" passes the buck. Only one character seems burned by the shame of the system and that is Fitzhugh (Matthew Broderick) who lost his job at Merrill Lynch and now faces eviction from the Tower. Broderick has always found flecks of exasperation and near-despair even in his cheeriest roles and this cruddy movie has one perfect moment in which Fitzhugh having moved out to a motel room is asked what hes up to. ""Im thinking of becoming a male prostitute"" he says instantly and without complaint. It gets a laugh because Broderick underplays it so well and because you fear it could be true. Strange to report ""Tower Heist"" might nonetheless become a footnote in the history of cinema as might Lars von Triers ""Melancholia"" another new release. The two works have almost nothing in common except that both show clumps of unlikable people behaving implausibly in confined spaces. More important both are enmeshed in the squabble over video on demand or VOD which allows customers to view a new or barely used film in the nest of their own home. On October 5th Universal Pictures announced a trial project whereby ""Tower Heist"" would be available to half a million households in Atlanta and Portland Oregon three weeks after its appearance in movie theatres at a cost of 59.99. Ones immediate reaction to this news was sixty bucks For a Brett Ratner movie Its like one of those cafes in Weimar Germany where a glass of beer cost you four billion marks. The stakes were raised considerably by reports that NATO was incensed by this latest move in the battle of VOD. For one heady morning I was under the impression that air strikes would be launched on Universal. Only then was it explained to me that NATO stands for the National Association of Theatre Owners who regard the ""Tower Heist"" experiment and similar ventures as the thin end of a deadening wedge. Download a Ben Stiller movie in Atlanta and you wind up a few years later with a nation of vacant auditoriums. Moviegoers will still watch movies; they just wont go. ""Can you blame us?"" they will cry. ""Who wants to pay for a sitter drive twenty miles in the rain and sit in a fug of vaporized popcorn butter next to people who are either auditioning for Contagion 2 or texting the Mahabharata to their second-best friends?"" And the answer is me. Im with NATO on this all the more tenaciously because we will in the final reckoning lose. Universal actually backed down in the scrap over ""Tower Heist"" and cancelled the VOD release but like other studios it will surely return to the fray. And the outcome? Showmen like James Cameron I suspect will continue to haul us off our couches for the grand marquee events but smaller fare may be streamed to us direct and new films whittled down into just another channel on TV. Theres only one problem with home cinema it doesnt exist. The very phrase is an oxymoron. As you pause your film to answer the door or fetch a Coke the experience ceases to be cinema. Even the act of choosing when to watch means you are no longer at the movies. Choice--preferably an exhaustive menu of it--pretty much defines our status as consumers and has long been an unquestioned tenet of the capitalist feast but in fact carte blanche is no way to run a cultural life (or any kind of life for that matter) and one thing that has nourished the theatrical experience from the Athens of Aeschylus to the multiplex is the element of compulsion. Someone else decides when the show will start; we may decide whether to attend but once we take our seats we join the ride and surrender our will. The same goes for the folks around us whom we do not know and whom we resemble only in our private desire to know more of what will unfold in public on the stage or screen. We are strangers in communion and once that pact of the intimate and the populous is snapped the charm is gone. Our revels now are ended. ""Melancholia"" is a prime exhibit in the argument because although it hits movie screens on November 11th it has been available via VOD since October 7th. So is it out or isnt it? And can anyone think of a more unsuitable film to watch in a living room? Von Triers latest fable is nothing without its blaze of majesty--or as his detractors would say its bombast. The middle of the film is an itchy and tremulous account of a wedding party at a Swedish country house in which the bride Justine (Kirsten Dunst) keeps wandering off to take a bath or to have sex on the golf course with someone other than the groom while maintaining frayed relations with her foul-tempered mother (Charlotte Rampling) her feckless father (John Hurt) and her anxiety-ridden sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who looks nothing whatever like her. Fun for everyone Meanwhile the earth is about to die. Justine steeped in chronic depression feels that her world is caving in and as if in sympathy our world does the same--bracing itself to be swallowed by a vast blue planet that has till now been ""hiding behind the sun."" Few astronomers will vouch for this game of cosmic peekaboo yet when we see the swallowing in action at the preemptive start of the film its quite a spectacle--gusted along by the prelude to ""Tristan and Isolde"" and intercut with slow-motion shots of Justine in her wedding dress dragging skeins of heavy gray yarn like a convict in chains and of Claire bearing a child in her arms her feet sinking deep into soft turf with every step. These sights are wondrous to behold and in their embodiment of Stygian souls they leave the rest of the movie looking superfluous. Even if you loathe von Trier then and whatever the weather please resist the lure of video on demand and go see ""Melancholia"" where it belongs. As Justines mother says of marriage and as the movie tries to say of mortal life so we should say of cinema ""Enjoy it while it lasts.""

(Photo Peter Mountain/Courtesy of Film District) We Hunter S. Thompson freaks never stop hoping for a filmmaker to come along and re-create the buzz of reading him in that short-but-so-sweet era when his prose was as exhilarating as rock and roll and a damn sight funnier before the drugs and booze made him not just batty but incapable of stringing together two coherent thoughts. And what a time this would be for that great Thompson movie what with Occupy Wall Street gleefully settled in and driving our mayor to splutter more than ever like a high-school principal with Nixonian notions of civil liberties. But The Rum Diary has no mighty gonzo wind. Even with a push from its Thompson-worshipping star Johnny Depp it leaves our freak flag limp. Writer-director Bruce Robinson was smart to throw out a lot of his source material a listless autobiographical novel that Thompson began in 1959 at age 22 and didnt publish until 1998 when he was too far gone to make it better. Robinsons idea is conventional but good to introduce Thompson (here called Paul Kemp and played by Depp) as a drunk and a failed writer with no particular political convictions and dramatize how he found his outrageand with it his voice his gonzo. The setting is San Juan Puerto Rico where Kemp has just taken a job with a failing English-language newspaper. The Caribbean is changing fast Cuba has fallen to Castro and developers have their eyes on other rum-soaked islands with beachfront property. The gap between the wealthy and the working class is widening. Kemp wakes up on his first full day in town with a vicious hangover stumbles past a tumultuous picket line into the office (run by Richard Jenkins in a garish toupee) and instantly attracts the attention of a wealthy slickster named Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) whos looking for a skilled writer to plant favorable stories about a proposed development. Theres a lot of money to be made from other peoples resources. The puzzler is why on Earth Sanderson and his cronies would think Kemp is the man to carry their water. Depp is playing a hybrid of the young and old Thompson and looks bleary and apatheticand hes too busy ogling Sandersons fiancee (Amber Heard whos like an android fashioned to resemble Scarlett Johansson) even to make eye contact with anyone else. Around this central nonstorymeant to account for Kemps rebirth as a journalist committed to afflicting the powerfulRobinson stages various drug-and-alcohol-fueled misadventures with Michael Rispoli as a cruddy photographer and Giovanni Ribisi as the human embodiment of the D.T.s a blotchy cadaverous creature dispensing hallucinogenics and squeaky non sequiturs. Rollicking car chases colorful carousing in tropical settings psychedelics jags with outlandish special effects It should be just what the Doctor of Gonzo ordered. But Robinson doesnt have the gonzo touch. Even if his Withnail amp; I featured a spectacularly dissolute antihero it was soaked through with cold rain and the melancholy specter of alcoholism and failure. To work The Rum Diary would need to make the case for all the excesses that killed Thompson and Robinsons heart (or talent) isnt in it. The movie builds to a cockfight the winnings from which will allow Kemp to publish a final excoriating issue of the newspaperexcept that you cant stage cockfights in movies nowadays so the shots are brief and Animal Welfare was reportedly on hand to ensure that the birds never actually touched. No Im not calling for the return of cockfighting but a cockfight without cockfighting is a better metaphor for the filmmakers impotence than any I could dream up. The Occupy Wall Street people will get a bigger populist boost from Tower Heist a shameless but exuberantly well-done caper comedy about employees of an apartment building for the super-wealthy who band together to rob the smug Madoffian billionaire (Alan Alda) who gobbled up among other things their pension fund. Ben Stiller as a micromanager with a chip on his shoulder and Eddie Murphy as a calculating street thief show off two of the best fastballs in comedy and Tea Leonis best scene as an FBI agentdrunk both sloppy and bluntmakes you wish she had more. The screenplay (credited to Ted Griffin and Jeff Nathanson) is packed with nifty gags and director Brett Ratner stages a sequence involving a sports car dangling from the top of a skyscraper that makes us all Scottie Ferguson in Vertigo our eyes making like yo-yos.
