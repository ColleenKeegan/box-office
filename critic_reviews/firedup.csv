A long extended cheer full of chirpy athletic acting plus acrobatic word play and ready-made catch phrases a la Juno or Superbad. The plot like the film is cover cinema. Or you might say the movies cheerleader stars serve as a cover performing a medley of other quirky teen comedy triumphs. Beginning with the girl crazed duos Bueller-esque dash through backyards and over fences as they flee the aforementioned angry pops only to land in a pool brimming with bikini-clad babes. Shawn is the ""smart"" one and Nick the ""funny"" (or funnier) one. Theyre a bit like Ferris Bueller split in two with Shawn representing his softer seemingly sweet sincere side and Nick his relentless humor and devilish desire for fun (and ladies). (And a hes also a little Homer Simpson ""Mmm ... cheerleaders rolled together."") As summer arrives horndog and horndoggier decide that rather than attend all-bro football camp in the fiery hell of El Paso theyd prefer a booty-full two weeks at a nearly all-gal cheerleading camp. Luckily their high schools all-boob and no-brawn cheer team the Tigers are in need of some strong helping male hands. Once the bustkateers land on hottie island they plow their way through paradise one woman at a time until true love throws them off course -- mainly when Shawn becomes smitten with Carla (Sarah Roemer in Disturbia) a feisty yet goofy Elliot Reid (from Scrubs) type who appears at first immune to his mojo. To further mix up matters Carly is dating the ""douchy"" Dr. Rick who adores scrambling his girlfriends name -- ""Carls Barkley Carly Fries etc."" (And for anyone old enough to recall he is reminiscent of the also douchy big brother in Weird Science.) Fired Up definitely isnt bashful about its borrowing. References and odes to ancestors abound. Including an outdoor cinema scene with cheerleaders reverently reciting dialogue as they watch Bring it On. As cover cinema its cleverly composed and flawlessly delivered by a well-synced ensemble. Embellished with comic stunts and skits such as Shawn and Nick staging a treed Frisbee rescue to demonstrate their cheerleader capabilities the growling hand-sign sign off of the Tigers nemesis the Panthers or a mid-movie Austin Powers-y pompom cheer in the buff. Plus my fave and the single standout performance Shawns sis Poppy. A young Joan Cusack with the soul and hard-hitting humor of Groucho Marx who supplies the boys with whatever they need wherever they need it -- from advice to black market candy. Fired Up is a likable film and you may want to like it even more than you do but you probably wont. Its likable but unlike other teen cult classics not as memorable. As well orchestrated an ode as it is you still somehow know that its not the real thing. Theres something Stepford-esque about the acting (minus Poppy and especially the bosom buddies). A dead-inside soulless cheer similar to what you might get from minimum-wage workers that deal with the public. No spontaneity and singular personality. All spunk and no spark make for a mediocre movie. Like the Tigers 19th-place performance at the camp competition Fired Up fails to bring it on enough to make the cheerleader (or teen) cinema A-list.

"Fired Up | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fired-up ) Fired Up (United States 2009) February 20 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli They might as well have called this Cheer Movie. About the only thing to differentiate this dud of a comedy from the likes of Date Movie Epic Movie and Disaster Movie is the absence of the names Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg on the credits. Instead the director is a first-timer named Will Gluck. Based on the evidence here one hopes he will do what Seltzer and Friedberg didnt and stop making movies. Regardless of how low your expectations are regarding Fired Up it will still surprise you and not in a good way. I dont approach a movie like this with a greater hope than that it will make me laugh a few times. Even with the bar set so low Fired Up cant deliver. This a morass of failed humor. Every joke is tired obvious and telegraphed. Its like going to a family reunion and hearing Uncle Bob tell the same gags he has told at every family reunion for the past twenty years. At one point they might have been worth a chuckle or two but now youll do just about anything including actions that would be considered illegal in all 50 states to get him to shut up. I suppose this is intended to be a parody of Bring It On although thats by no means certain. The concept of parody implies humor and theres nothing resembling that here. To make matters worse Fired Up is obviously an R-rated movie masquerading as a PG-13. The emasculation is so painfully evident that it calls attention to itself skinny-dipping scenes in which women are in their underwear or where their breasts are below the water line (the nudity as is almost always the case in PG-13 comedies refers to bare male buttocks) euphemisms for ""fuck"" and softening of the most extreme sexual innuendo. I dont know if a raunchier balls-to-the-wall approach would have made Fired Up a better movie (probably not) but it at least would have seemed more honest. Undoubtedly there will be an ""unrated"" DVD that will restore some of the R-rated content that was clipped in the editing room. The story is a typical example of the one-line so-called ""high concept."" Two high school football players Shawn (Nicholas DAgosoto) and Nick (Eric Christian Olsen) attend cheerleading camp to get girls. Toss in a competition at the end ""quirky"" supporting characters and a few subplots like Shawn falling for Carly (Sarah Roemer) the captain of the squad and Nick getting the hots for the ""much older"" Diora (Molly Sims) one of the camps directors. Perhaps the saddest thing of all is seeing respected actor Philip Baker Hall ""shitting"" his way through the movie. (The financial crisis must really be hitting home for him - I guess Holiday Inn isnt paying enough these days.) There may be a restriction to the number of times ""fuck"" can be used to achieve the PG-13 Holy Grail but Fired Up proves that shit has no limit. The most amusing aspect of the film is either (a) unintentional or (b) so subversive that I may be guilty of underestimating the filmmakers. (The smart money is on (a).) The characters in Fired Up are supposed to be 17 or 18. In general that means the actors would typically be in their early 20s with perhaps Sarah Roemers 24 being on the high end. But noa| Nicholas DAgosoto is 28 Danneel Harris is 29 and Eric Christian Olsen is 31. (He still falls three years short of the all-time record for oldest movie teenager 34-year old Stockard Channing in Grease.) Olsen by the way is in the unenviable position of not being able to claim that Fired Up is the worst film on his resume. He played the young Jim Carrey role in Dumb and Dumberer. I can think of no reason why anyone would want to see Fired Up and the movie-going public seems to agree with that assessment - I was one of only three people in the theater where it was showing. The film relies on the clichA(c)d outtakes-during-the-closing-credits approach to generate a few cheap late laughs. But even these arent funny. How bad does a movie have to be that even the bloopers are duds? About halfway through the proceedings the temptation to slip into the next-door theater arose - until I remembered that the movie playing there was Confessions of a Shopaholic. At that moment I began to contemplate the similarities between film critics and garbage men. Both deal with a lot of crap but the trash collectors get better pay.

"Fired Up Gets tired out fast | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentFired Up Gets tired out fastIf youre going to make a cheerleader comedy you might as well be obvious about what youre ripping off. So its oddly endearing when the attendees at the cheer camp in Fired Up can be seen watching Bring It On at an outdoor screening especially when they all parrot the dialogue as if it were The Rocky Horror Picture Show .Nicholas DAgosto left and Eric Christian Olsen try to score in Fired Up.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Feb. 20 2009Starring Nicholas DAgosto Eric Christian Olsen and John Michael Higgins. Directed by Will Gluck. 89 minutes. At major theatres. PG If youre going to make a cheerleader comedy you might as well be obvious about what youre ripping off. So its oddly endearing when the attendees at the cheer camp in Fired Up can be seen watching Bring It On at an outdoor screening especially when they all parrot the dialogue as if it were The Rocky Horror Picture Show. That counts as one of the better moments in this sloppy but moderately amusing attempt to cross the 2000 Kirsten Dunst hit with the raunchier brand of teen comedy that came in the wake of American Pie. The opening scenes definitely lean more toward the latter as two Steve Stifler stand-ins named Shawn (Nicholas DAgosto) and Nick (Eric Christian Olsen) scheme to skip out on summer practice with their Illinois high school football team to ""hook up like maniacs"" at a camp for cheerleaders. The only catch is that they have to join their school squad.The fact the actors playing the teenaged Lotharios are clearly too old for their roles - DAgosto is 28 while Olsen is a positively geriatric 31 - adds a distinct level of creepiness to the proceedings. The ease with which these sleazebags cut a swath through the camps female population may also have you worrying about the spread of STDs in southeastern Illinois. Article Continued BelowThe slim excuse for a plot line in Fired Up consists largely of Shawns efforts to woo their squad captain Carly (Sarah Roemer) whom the duo originally dismissed as a potential conquest because ""she respects herself too much."" Nick has his eye on Diora (Molly Sims) a camp counsellor he finds alluring because shes like 30 years old - ""Just the way I like em"" he says ""ancient and regretful.""Even though the camera takes every opportunity to ogle the ""fresh produce"" on display the PG rating means that theres a definite cap on just how raunchy Fired Up can be. Maybe thats why the movies humour turns out to be more inventive than the repellently chauvinistic premise would otherwise demand. (The not-entirely-hostile attitude toward the gay and lesbian characters qualifies as relatively progressive-minded for the genre too.)A reliably hilarious regular in Christopher Guests company of players John Michael Higgins raises the bar with a spirited turn as the camps director. Matters also perk up with the arrival of Carlys college boyfriend Rick (David Walton) a less charming variety of cad who insists on being referred to as ""doctor"" despite being only in pre-med and sings along to desperately uncool songs (""Mambo No. 5"" included) on his car stereo. Lazy and crude as the movie may be Fired Ups cast members have some fun as they hit their marks in a routine that even they recognize as tired and familiar.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Fired Up. (PG-13) Screen Gems (94 min.). Directed by Will Gluck. With Nicholas DAgosto Eric Christian Olsen Sarah Roemer. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE STAR. ""Fired Up"" is a movie full of disgusting slang (how about ""meatloafs"" for breasts?) made-up dirty words (""snootch"" ""padonkadonk"") explicit discussions of sexual acts (dont ask) and about 300 teenagers searching frantically for liquor or intercourse. It is rated PG-13. You know ""Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13."" You think? Every decade or so we get a new all-out dirty-joke comedy about randy teenagers -- ""Porkys"" ""American Pie"" ""Superbad."" Some like ""Animal House"" are actually well-made; others are well ""Zapped."" But all have R ratings and deliver the gratuitous dirty-joke thrills they promise. ""Fired Up"" does neither. It may have an okay-for-middle-school PG-13 but this is an R movie with all the ""adult"" material only slightly obscured. So kids get drunk but not our heroes; there are jokes about every kind of sex but nothing is actually shown. Its all cheap hypocrisy a stripper with pasties. Worse its not even funny. Or sexy. That shouldnt be too surprising as its the product of Maxim magazine a publication that briefly made a name for itself as a slightly cleaned-up mostly dumbed-down Playboy offering cheesecake (but no explicit nudity) and dirty jokes (but no real erotica). The story follows Nicholas DAgosto and Eric Christian Olsen two way-past-school-age high schoolers as they enroll themselves in cheerleader camp so they can chase girls in short skirts. This they do for the next 90 minutes while mugging furiously for the camera. The script actually has a couple of good lines and bits of inventive dialogue but nothing here really works no matter how loud the cast screams at us to laugh. DAgosto is merely pleasant as the less raunchy of the two boys. As his oversexed partner Olsen is aggressively offensive -- and at nearly 32 not only way too old for this but also only four years younger than Molly Sims insultingly cast as the ""older woman."" (Sarah Roemer escapes mostly unscathed as the lone ""nice girl."") The script is credited to a mysterious off-the-grid character called ""Freedom Jones"" which Im assuming is a pseudonym. The direction is courtesy of Will Gluck who should have used a pseudonym. The production company is Gross Entertainment -- pretty appropriate considering the sleazy parade of sex toys sexist assumptions and snickering homophobia. And the ratings folks think this ""may"" be inappropriate for children? Excuse me I hear someone at the gates. Must be the barbarians here at last. Ratings note The film contains sexually explicit content and substance abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

If this movie were a teenager youd put it on Ritalin right away. Directed with blowtorch subtlety by veteran TV producer Will Gluck in his big-screen debut ""Fired Up"" is an occasionally amusing sometimes horrifying misogynistic homophobic and half-heartedly satiric mash-up of ""American Pie"" ""Porkys"" and ""Bring It On"" among many others. In the movies funniest scene the girls at cheerleading camp recite dialogue out loud at a screening of the latter film. Less intentional laughs derive from strenuous efforts to suggest R-rated smuttiness within the box-office-friendly confines of a PG-13 rating. Theres a lot less on-screen action than there is talk about it more male nudity than female and some of the biggest laughs derive from the filmmakers extreme inventiveness in sexual euphemisms. A sample ""You can winky tinky on my face just dont tell me its raining."" Although all of the actors make rather elderly teens coming off best here is Nicholas DAgosto as Shawn the more sincere of our horn-dog heroes. Sarah Roemer who resembles a younger Cate Blanchett is also not bad as Carly the squad leader Shawn falls for in spite of her suspicions about the guys motives - and despite a jerk of a college boyfriend who calls himself ""Dr. Rick"" (the appalling unfunny David Walton). Shawns way-stupider bud is played by the tow-headed Eric Christian Olsen whose crassness conceals a secret poetic spirit that wins him the heart of a 30-year-old hottie (Molly Sims whose character he charmingly describes as ""ancient and desperate"") married to the camps not-so-closeted leader. The latter is played by John Michael Higgins a regular in Christopher Guests movies who fares far better than the distinguished Philip Baker Hall (of Paul Thomas Andersons rep comedy) desperately miscast as the football coach. ""Fired Up"" is the kind of movie that can sincerely quote John Lennon one minute then have a character proclaim that ""we can take a dump in our pants and do better than last year."" Make that a double dose of Ritalin. lou.lumenicknypost.com FIRED UP Bring it off. Running time 89 minutes. Rated PG-13 (crude sexual humor partial nudity profanity).

(Kock Lorber Films) BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS FILM CRITICS Thursday February 19 2009 825 PM ""Must Read After My Death"" 4 stars Portrait of a 1960s housewife. At the Quad (115). Not rated. The title of Morgan Dews intensely compelling documentary refers to a stash of journals that his grandmother Allis made throughout the 1960s. And while its more of a request than a demand the ""must"" feels apt. It would have been a terrible shame if no one had known how tragic her seemingly ordinary life actually was. A reluctant housewife Allis was required to raise her fractured family as her angry husband and patronizing doctors saw fit despite her superior instincts. Dews wisely realizes that he needs nothing more than his grandparents writings recordings and home movies to portray the stark emptiness of Allis life as well as the sexist neurotically conformist culture that smothered her.  - Elizabeth Weitzman ""Fired Up"" 1 star Two high school jocks go to cheerleader camp to score chicks. At area theaters (129). PG-13 Language sexuality. Like a lost raunch comedy from the 80s this medium-concept flick about two football-playing wise guys who go cheerleader camp for the hot-girl nookie tries waaay too hard just like its motormouth jock-snark heroes (Nicholas DAgosto and Eric Christian Olsen). And spending time with these guys is the longest 89 minutes ever. Still it does have an amusing jackass villain turn by David Walton and preteen boys may love it for the obvious reasons.  - Joe Neumaier Katyn 3 stars Drama about mass killings by the Soviet Army of Polish officers during World War II. At Film Forum (201). Not rated Violence. Director Andrzej Wajdas quiet film about an atrocity long hidden in his homeland -- the murder of thousands of Polish officers by Stalins army following the annexation of Poland -- is a pensive and searching drama that explores how deep into the national psyche these murders in the Katyn forest went. A serious contemplative antidote to the many Hollywood-ized WWII movies of the last few months. - J.N. Eleven Minutes 3 stars A ""Project Runway"" winner prepares for his first fashion show. At the Quad (143). Not rated Language. Reality TV has its moments but the most interesting stuff always happens after the cameras stop rolling. If you watched ""Project Runways"" first season and wondered what happened to winner Jay McCarroll heres your chance to find out. Fashion fanatics will appreciate the behind-thescenes perspective as McCarroll plans his first show but others wont care much since he spends so much time complaining about opportunities other struggling designers would kill for. He is at least clearly talented and if nothing else the movie proves that he did earn the title he treats as a burden. - E.W.

"Review Fired Up - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Review Fired Up Fired Up Screen Gems Screen Gems Mark Olsen The teen romp comedy ""Fired Up"" can be viewed much like a Wal-Mart in that its consumers pretty much know exactly what quality of product theyre going to get -- serviceable and sturdy nothing flashy or unique. ""Fired Up"" is a distraction of limited appeal with no desire to be anything more.In it a pair of football players -- played by Nicholas DAgosto and Eric Christian Olsen both actors closer to 30 than the high schoolers they portray -- are interested more in girls and sexual conquest than football camp so they decide to attend summer cheerleader camp to swim in a sea of better percentages. Subsequent lessons are learned. The film tries desperately to have it both ways to linger a little too long on lithe young female bodies in skimpy tight-fitting exercise gear while also maintaining a thin veneer of sensitivity so as to not alienate any potential female audience members. The makers of ""Fired Up"" are self-aware enough to directly reference ""Bring It On"" the ""Godfather"" of modern cheerleader movies but not competent enough to match its wit verve or sharp visual grammar. The clunky cheerleading sequences prove that having filmmaking equipment and knowing what to do with it are two very distinct things.The film does raise the question Just when did John Michael Higgins become one of the funniest people in America? He can be glimpsed as far back as ""Vampires Kiss"" more recently in such films as ""A Mighty Wind"" and ""The Break-Up"" and is the most watchable thing on TVs ""Kath amp; Kim."" He effortlessly pulls off the getting-it/not getting-it mix that the rest of the cast here gropes toward and the movie perks up whenever he is on screen as the sexually ambiguous head of the cheerleading camp. Passable in its efficiency ""Fired Up"" is less offensive than it might have been while also managing to be staggeringly uninspired. It tries to put its loutish behavior in ironic quotation marks but being smart enough to know when youre being an idiot still doesnt make the behavior welcome.calendarlatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Fired Up (movie) Movies Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Comedies about the maturing of arrested adolescents--or just adolescents period--are rampant in the Judd Apatow age but theres a trick to doing the ""likeable jerk"" character right. The actors have to be charismatic enough to make their horndog-slob routines forgivable or even charming and the script should stop well short of the line separating the comically boorish from the irredeemably smug. Like a grotesque hybrid between the straight-to-DVD American Pie and Bring It On sequels Fired Up asks the audience to root for a skirt-chasing Seacrest-and-Dunkleman pair who operate like a hive-minded Van Wilder. Yes theyre given some room to grow over the course of the film--and given an even douchier villain for contrast--but its hard to wish them the best while also wishing at all times for the opportunity to punch them square in their smirking little faces. The opening scene finds our ostensible heroes played by Nicholas DAgosto and Eric Christian Olsen trying to talk two naive girls out of their underwear like those de-virginizing cretins in Kids. When the girls roided-up dads come home early DAgosto and Olsen hightail it through the neighborhood only to splash right into a bikini party. Thats pretty much what lifes like for them especially since theyre also stars on their high-school football team which seems to give them all the action they could ever want. Faced with the prospect of sweating it out with other guys at a football training camp in El Paso they hatch a scheme to get even more girls by attending cheerleading camp instead. The schools head cheerleader (Sarah Roemer) stays dubious but the other 299 girls at camp are all portrayed as open for business--at least those who arent lipstick lesbians. Problem is Fired Up seriously miscalculates DAgosto and Olsens frat-guy magnetism. Their rapid-fire banter trades heavily in snarky pop-culture references homo jokes and catchphrases like ""You have to risk it to get the biscuit."" On the off chance that anyone out there would want to spend time with guys like this--and would appreciate a bonus plug for Staples recycled paper products too--this movie has been made just for them.

ABOUT THE MOVIEFired Up  (out of four) Stars Nicholas DAgosto Eric Christian Olsen Sarah Roemer Molly SimsDirector Will GluckDistributor Sony Pictures EntertainmentRating PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout partial nudity language and some teen partyingRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens today nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Though we wouldnt advise getting fired up and ready to go stand in line for it this much can definitely be said about Fired Up Its funnier than Paul Blart Mall Cop. Where Mall Cop is so far the years most inane comedy -- and also mystifyingly the most successful at the box office --Fired Up offers certifiably silly humor surrounding the antics of a pair of high school football jocks who go to cheerleading camp. You will laugh though not uproariously and not often enough. You also will occasionally cringe and know exactly how things will turn out. SEE A CLIP Get Fired Up Still Nicholas DAgosto is likeable as Shawn the slightly more sensitive and sweet of the testosterone-overloaded lotharios. Eric Christian Olsen as the slick-talking Nick has some appealingly comic moments. Together they are a reasonably funny duo. One repeated joke is an example of the movies infectious silliness. As the bus full of enthusiastic cheerleaders heads off to camp they chant ""We are driving We we are driving"" And it grows more ridiculous with each ensuing antic. Its certainly not high wit but it does elicit a chuckle or two. The plot is simple Shawn and Nick decide to forego football camp for cheerleading camp in a bald effort to hook up with dozens of hotties. John Michael Higgins whose performances are always a highlight of the Christopher Guest movies plays Coach Keith. He runs the cheer camp with his wife Diora (Molly Sims) whom Nick tries doggedly to seduce. Shawn falls for his schools head cheerleader Carly (a bland Sarah Roemer). And despite their ulterior motives Nick and Shawn help the faltering squad improve by leaps and bounds. Fired Up is an energetic comic romp but the plot is weighed down by formula. Jokes are predictable. Theres a nude cheering scene with strategically placed pom-poms that seems particularly by the book. The movie also pays excessive homage to Bring it On and borrows from such teen sex comedies as American Pie. But at least it allows characters some dimension and dignity even the ditziest members of both genders and of all sexual orientations. And to its credit its not nearly as raunchy as some teen comedies. Though not nearly as raucously funny as the leads in Wedding Crashers Nick and Shawn resemble junior versions of the one-track-minded womanizers played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. As long as you dont expect too much Fired Ups aim is true enough. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Fired Up falls flat as cheerleading farce - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies MOVIE REVIEW Fired Up Cheerleading farce falls flat Sitting (from left) Danneel Harris Nicholas DAgosto and Eric Christian Olsen in Fired Up (Suzanne tenner) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / February 20 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Its worth noting that the movie about two dudes who ditch football camp to crash an Illinois camp for competitive cheerleading knows its dumb. It just doesnt know how dumb it wants to be.An incomplete sendup of sports movies a half-hearted spoof of teen hormones a straight (though not thoroughly heterosexual) romantic comedy ""Fired Up"" sends Shawn and Nick to ogle and seduce as many nubile tumblers as they can handle (everybody talks nasty but no nasty ever gets done).The jokes arent all terrible. They build over the basic premise like mildew; after a while only a good bathroom cleaner can cut through all the bad gags. The dialogue feels piped in from a Twitter proverb feed (""To win the biscuit you have to risk it"") and the succession of broad slack scenes suggests yet another movie made of bloopers and outtakes. Anyone whos seen a good cheer routine should wonder how these teams would ever make it to nationals. ""Fired Up"" feels like everybodys first time doing anything - writing acting directing cheerleading.A sports farce like ""Caddy-shack"" - eons ago I know but whats there been since? ""Caddyshack 2""? - knew what it found funny about golf and country clubs. Whats ""Fired Up"" laughing at? Its actually not cheerleading. Sexuality is the target for most of the gags. But those never come into any comedic focus. Gay panic for instance always appears on the verge of breaking out. (Men hit on Shawn about three times.) But the movie doesnt have the fortitude to flip this tired plot over. What didnt work in the cheerleading comedy ""Bring It On"" (low-key social commentary) or the gymnastics melodramedy ""Stick It"" (emotional sincerity) doesnt work here either.Truly entertaining vulgarity never happens. The movie has no comic or hormonal sensibility of its own - every feeling in ""Fired Up"" feels borrowed from another comedy television show or pop song. At best its a movie with the generic arc and canned personalities of MTVs self-help reality (""I Want to Be a Cheerleader""). What it needs is a devilish director - a recent graduate from the John Waters Outlandishness Academy. Or it needs the devil himself to put some camp in this camp.

Starring Nicholas DAgosto Eric Christian Olsen Sarah Roemer Molly Sims AnnaLynne McCord Director Will Gluck Running time 129  Editorial Review Hollywood has a silly habit of casting old for teen comedies. (Stockard Channing as Betty Rizzo hel-lo) Even by ""Grease"" standards however the pushing-30 Nicholas DAgosto and 31-year-old Eric Christian Olsen seem a bit long in the tooth to be donning the antic mask of the sexually irrepressible high school jock.Which may explain the ever-so-slightly paternalistic edge that creeps into their characters Shawn and Nick in ""Fired Up"" an arduous cheerleader comedy geared toward those too green to know that cheerleader comedies went out long before the last pompom shake of ""Bring It On.""That cunning Kirsten Dunst frolic is watched with reverence by the cheerleaders-in-training at Southern Illinois University where ex-footballers Shawn and Nick have insinuated themselves in hopes of fulfilling their wildest carnal dreams. The bodacious babes who make up the camps majority know just what the guys are up to but they inevitably give in because the fellas are single-minded straight and cute in that cookie-cutter Ashton Kutcher-y way that ensures an actor steady employment on network television shows like ""Heroes"" and ""Brothers amp; Sisters.""""Fired Up"" is the debut writing effort of one Freedom Jones who is shackled by an oppressive penchant for snark and a film students glib tendency to reference older and infinitely better movies. It is no more homophobic or cluttered with potty-mouthed braggadocio than your garden-variety post-""American Pie"" teen farce. Will Gluck directs with frantic go-for-broke pacing which is what you do when your reserves of wit are bankrupt.-- Jan Stuart (Feb. 20 2009)Contains crude and sexual content partial nudity language and teen partying.

""It is cra-zeeee that people think youre the smart one.""Nick and Sean are Gerald R. Ford Highs one-two punch on the gridiron -- a quarterback and his favorite tight end. (Make your own snappy joke about that.) Off the field theyre high school hounds in tandem chasing the ladies.""Sweet Mary in a D-cup""But theyre not into another blistering summer football camp with their crazy cussing coach (Philip Baker Hall). When they hear that cheer camp has ""300 hotties"" who dont know them the player-playas switch teams. ""Dude were athletes. We can do anything.""Will the lads learn some respect for the dangerous difficult sport of cheerleading? Is it all just ""kiss kiss bang bang"" to our heroes or will Sean lose his heart to Carly (Sarah Roemer) the no-nonsense head cheerleader? Can he steal her from her pre-med doofus Rick (David Walton a stitch)? Does Nick have a shot with cheer-coach Diora (Molly Sims)? Or is her hubby Coach Keith (John Michael Higgins hysterical as always) more his speed?Can the Tigers beat beat BEAT the hated Panthers in the big ""cheer off?""Guess.Fired Up is more a collection of zingers laugh-out-loud bits and punchy performances than a coherent movie. But the acting the dialogue and the cutting -- quick graceful never stepping on a funny line or sight gag -- sell it. Supporting players such as Adhir Kalyan (Paul Blart Mall Cop) drop in get their giggle and pop back out. The running gags sprint by as first-time feature director Will Gluck working from a wisecracking Freedom Jones script tracks his camera through cheer-camp hijinks with a generally light touch.We see a montage of the lads pick up lines (""This is weird. I never open up like this.""). All the kids in cheer camp watch Bring It On on the lawn and every kid mouths the dialogue which they all know by heart.Olsen and DAgosto are an Adam Sandlerproduced comedy waiting to happen. You can tell when players genuinely like each other and they click from the first time they treat an escape from the angry dads of a couple of almost conquered girls as a football play (""Button hook through the window keys-reverse on two ready? BREAK"") to their riff on ""Here I Go Again"" by Whitesnake in the closing-credit outtakes.It may be cheese and the cheese may be predictably bland cheddar but theres something to be said for casting commitment and craftsmanship. It may be as dumb as youd expect from this team but Fired Up is still the best ""dumb cheerleader"" comedy since Bring It On.

Posted February 18 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Two piggish high school football jocks pack themselves off to cheerleader camp where they cut a swath through the hardbodied gymnastic lovelies. The teensploitation premise is like something a porn filmmaker from the 70s might have come up with. But Fired Up has one added quirk The script credited to Freedom Jones is a riot of tongue-twisting ironic sleaze -- it sounds like the first (and last) collaboration between Diablo Cody and Artie Lange. Olsen whos like a blond Jim Morrison and DAgosto as scampish as he was glum ?in Rocket Science establish an interplay thats halfway amusing and terminally smug. B?

Mindful of its PG-13 rating ""Fired Up"" never quite does making it unsatisfying on both the comedic and prurient fronts; its ""American Pie"" light. Mix in bad performances a stupid story and actors practically old enough to be the parents of the characters theyre playing and you get a pretty stupid movie. Which isnt to say there arent a few laughs. Blind pig acorn all that. And any time John Michael Higgins and Philip Baker Hall are around even a little it elevates things somewhat. But mostly its hard to tell whats funnier watching 31-year-old Eric Christian Olsen play a high-school student or watching him try to act. Olsen plays Nick Brady the quarterback of the football team and best friend of Shawn Colfax (Nicholas DAgosto) the star wide receiver and resident smart guy. (DAgosto isnt exactly Laurence Olivier himself but hes so much better than the other ""young"" actors here he might as well be.) Together theyve cut a swath through the female half of the student body but are naturally unsatisfied. Thats when they learn about cheerleading camp. Figuring it will provide an endless supply of beautiful young women they sign up once they skip out of football camp. Carly (Sarah Roemer) the captain of the squad sees through their plans but cant stop them from going. Once there things play out about as youd expect. Higgins is funny as the camps leader who is married to the beautiful Diora (Molly Sims). Nick has the hots for her. Meanwhile adversaries Shawn and Carly begin to enjoy each others company more than they expected. But her ""pre-fiance"" a drip who calls himself Dr. Rick (David Walton) keeps interfering. Walton is funny as the obliviously self-centered Dr. Rick; a wretched 80s mix tape he keeps going in his car is as he puts it the soundtrack of his life. Fitting. Its the kind of role thats most effective in small doses and director Will Gluck is wise not to overuse him. Also funny is a scene in which the campers watch ""Bring It On"" together and know the lines by heart. Ultimately though ""Fired Up"" just isnt funny enough. Its not offensive really and maybe thats part of the problem. The success of films like ""Old School"" and the entries in the Judd Apatow stable is their willingness to do almost anything for a laugh. If that means full-frontal Jason Segel nudity so be it. ""Fired Up"" is by contrast tepid. Yes its aimed at a younger audience but its not as if kids wont be expecting more. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Not content to be just another dumb high school flick its actually teaching young virginal viewers to treat women like stupid submissive slut-cattle for the rest of their lives. Bored of banging every last chick in school horny football studs Shawn (Nicholas DAgosto) and Nick (Eric Christian Olsen) ditch their team for a couple weeks of cheer camp where they will be the only straight dudes in a sea of 600 tits er . . . 300 cheerleaders. Theyre basically the same insipid conquistador except Nick is the more officious schemer and Shawn is the science whiz who helps all the (brainless) girls with their homework. Learning a few cheers but never punished for their piggish insolence (the third-act inspirational speech literally ""Be a cocky asshole"") Nick eventually wins over an older coach (Molly Sims) with his secret poetry and Shawn falls in love with squad leader Carly (Sarah Roemer) because shes the only girl who didnt want to whore around on first sight. Were light years away from Animal House sure but who ever thought we would long for the richer funnier dignity of American Pie?

"Fired Up | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Fired Up Robert Koehler 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 10 2009 | 1104PM PT ""Fired Up"" is just a sad cheapo bid to be the ""Bring It On"" of the 00s. If the sorry state of Hollywood comedy could use a boost from a pep squad its let down by the droopy ""Fired Up"" in which a pair of high school football-playing lotharios man up for the cheerleading team. The guys view the cheerleading field as new sexual turf to plow -- and plow they do -- but the pic is just a sad cheapo bid to be the ""Bring It On"" of the 00s. Opening weekend will stick the landing with target teen and college crowds with overtime action in vid. Deep in southeastern Illinois which suspiciously looks a lot like the Southern California suburbs Shawn (Nicholas DAgosto) and Nick (Eric Christian Olsen) are inseparable buddies and the go-to offensive combo for the Gerald Ford High School Tigers varsity football team led by beyond-foul-mouthed Coach Byrnes (Philip Baker Hall in an embarrassing role). Byrnes utters ""shit"" so many times in one minute that Shawn and Nick actually keep count making one wonder what the MPAAs quota for a PG-13 rating actually is. Looking dimly on the prospect of summer football camp in sizzling El Paso Texas and bored with the local babes the pair overhear the Tiger cheerleaders -- captained by Carly (Sarah Roemer) -- strategizing for their own summer camps competitive tourney; the guys figure theyll try out and bag some new hotties. With their verbal skills and supreme grasp of science along with a knack for the right seductive tone Shawn and Nick are ESPN-ized versions of Valmont from ""Les Liaisons dangereuses"" mixed with Hope and Crosby. The moment Carly (rightly) suspects these dudes intentions its as clear as a refs flag that Shawn will conquer her in the end. Of course there are obstacles along the way starting with Carlys current obnoxious (is there any other kind?) beau self-named Dr. Rick (the unfunny David Walton); followed by a nasty rival cheer squad (and perennial champs) the Panthers dressed in black and led by snarly Gwyneth (Annalynne McCord) whos determined to keep the customarily cellar-dwelling Tigers in their place. In a sign that Shawn and Nick can have their way with any woman -- within 24 hours after arriving at camp they have sex with at least a dozen -- Nick even manages to seduce thirtysomething camp co-head Diora (Molly Sims) married to heavily closeted Coach Keith (played by John Michael Higgins with his characteristically ironic vigor). Pics sideline action involving several gay and lesbian students and teachers is out for all to see a sign of greater sexual openness for a mainstream teen comedy. Nevertheless ""Fired Up"" settles for being little more than a rehash of formulas with nothing to pep things up. A scene in which the camp teams watch an alfresco screening of ""Bring It On"" gives the game away and incorrectly assumes that the earlier cheerleading comedy is universally considered a classic. DAgosto and Olsen pump up Freedom Jones lame script with a verbal rat-a-tat-tat call-and-response energy that gives off the impression of being at least partly improvised. Roemer survives with her dignity intact while petite smart-mouthed Juliette Goglia works to steal her scenes. Director Will Gluck gets a possessory credit even though the films production standard is the impersonally bland glossy norm for studio comedies.
