BOTTOM LINE How do you spoof a self-parody? This is merely dumber and more crass than the actual franchise. CAST Jenn Proske Matt Lanter Christopher N. Riggi LENGTH 116 Why does ""Vampires Suck"" a spoof of the ""Twilight"" franchise feel undead on arrival? Probably because it has no heart. The best satires actually love their victims. Mel Brooks ""Young Frankenstein"" paid tribute to classic horror films. ""Airplane"" showed a near-scholarly grasp on disaster movies. Even the merciless Mad magazine parodies of the 1970s - ""The Ecchorcist"" comes to mind - were drawn and written with great admiration for the originals. Granted the ""Twilight"" films are difficult to love. For starters they feel like soulless marketing ploys (though millions of preteen girls might beg to differ). Whats more they are already self-parodies. At any ""Twilight"" screening where grown-ups are present Kristen Stewarts sulking Bella Swan and Robert Pattinsons tortured Edward Cullen will be greeted with more than a few laughs. advertisement | advertise on newsday The writer-directors of ""Vampires Suck"" Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are veterans of the ""Scary Movie"" and ""Date Movie"" spoofs. Those covered genres; here were limited to one film series and the jokes run out fast. Matt Lanter preens as the vampire Edward Sullen a well-oiled Christopher N. Riggi takes the hunky Taylor Lautner role and Jenn Proske as Becca Crane does a dead-on Stewart sigh for sigh snort for snort. Ken Jeong of ""The Hangover"" slums it in a small role. ""Vampires Suck"" frequently mistakes hostility for humor. Characters insult themselves (""Im a sourpuss"" Becca says) carp about the story line (""its the ultimate pre-pubescent fantasy"") and when all else fails hit each other or pass gas. Its almost as cynical as the actual ""Twilight"" and not nearly as funny.

BY Elizabeth Weitzman Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS FILM CRITICS Friday August 20 2010 400 AM SOUL KITCHEN Comedy about a failing restaurant. At the IFC Lincoln Plaza (139). Not rated Sex violence. In German with English subtitles.Food-oriented movies have become trendy but theyre often so carefully shot that they feel remote. (See each perfect Parmesan curl in ""Eat Pray Love."") Fatih Akin takes a more casual approach and the results have an edgy amusing charm.His hero Zinos (co-writer Adam Bousdoukos) is a flailing restaurant owner in Hamburg Germany. His girlfriend is fed up with the long hours the health inspectors trying to shut him down and his criminal brother (Moritz Bleibtreu) is determined to cause trouble. As a last resort Zinos hires a gifted new chef (Birol Unel) -- but the locals just want their familiar burgers and frozen pizza.Akin (""Head-On"") dilutes his characteristic acidity but thats okay. His respectable goal is no different from Zinos to please a crowd while gently expanding some palates. Elizabeth WeitzmanVAMPIRES SUCK Spoof of the ""Twilight"" films. At area theaters (127). PG-13 Sexuality violencelanguage.All but the most die-hard fans can agree that the ""Twilight"" movies are spoof-worthy. So its too bad they dont get a worthy spoof.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer -- who also churned out ""Epic Movie"" and ""Disaster Movie"" -- are mostly content to condense and rehash the beloved vamp romance trilogy with obvious gags punctuating the story line.What they do get right is Kristen Stewarts mannered portrayal of Bella (satirized nicely by a sullen Jenn Proske). Chris Riggi does a good job as the ab-fab Jacob too. Unfortunately though for every decent laugh there are twice as many groans. ""Vampires"" doesnt suck exactly but the laziness and lack of imagination kinda bites. E.W.MAOS LAST DANCER Drama about a Chinese ballet stars life in Beijing and America. At the Paris and Sunshine Cinema (157). PG Language.This noble but dull biopic about Chinese dissident ballet star Li Cunxin adapted from his autobiography falters as a drama but nonetheless puts sumptuous dance performances center stage. Born into poverty Li (played by Birmingham Royal Ballet principal dancer Chi Cao) is chosen at age 11 to study at the Beijing Dance Academy. He becomes one of that esteemed schools first students to visit the U.S.But while in Houston the teenage Li falls in love with young American dancer Elizabeth MacKay (Amanda Schull) and rushes into marriage forcing an international incident when he tries to visit his family in China.Soapy proceedings but director Bruce Beresford who made the classics ""Breaker Morant"" and ""Tender Mercies"" and the Oscar-winning ""Driving Miss Daisy"" never goes over the top sometimes to a fault. Joe NeumaierA FILM UNFINISHED Documentary about rediscovered film of the Warsaw ghetto in 1942. At Film Forum and Lincoln Plaza (130). Not rated Holocaust images. In German with English subtitles.This ghostly gripping documentary about raw film footage taken from SS propaganda projects made in the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 found at the end of the war then rediscovered in the 1960s is a chronicle of fear and bravery in the face of annihilation.Journal entries voiceovers and reconstructions pull together the mostly black-and-white scenes of daily life and disturbingly staged ""rehearsals"" of Jews living under Nazi rule. Director Yael Hersonskis film is a kind of historical detective story made up of haunting montages including a theater performance featuring a heartbroken musician thats absolutely chilling. J.N.

But when the film has an actual name (Meet the Spartans the new Vampires Suck) audiences should expect a pretty straightforward pastiche of a single currently hot title in this case Twilight. A shame because a few broader references (Dracula Buffy True Blood) might have made this punishing one-note trawl through the eminently spoofable tween-vamp saga slightly more watchable. Audiences know what to expect from Friedberg and Seltzer by now - pratfalls fart gags gay jokes blunt sexual innuendo an almost uncanny absence of wit style or intelligence - and Vampires Suck follows the formula to the letter. But lets try to focus on the positives theres a faintly amusing whinge-rock pisstake over the opening titles and six of those 82 minutes are taken up by the closing credits.

"Vampires Suck has some comic bite - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesVampires Suck has some comic biteThe parody of the first two Twilight movies mostly delivers.August 19 2010 Surprise ""Vampires Suck"" actually doesnt. The parody of the first two ""Twilight"" movies is the usual mixed bag of hits and misses but with more hits than expected. For those who cant get enough of photogenic teen vampires and werewolves consider this another helping albeit basted in mockery. For those who were dragged to those movies at least here the two are compressed into one 82-minute sulk-and-bite fest.Plenty of gags fall flat but writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer due credit or blame for many recent spoofs (""Date Movie"" ""Epic Movie"" etc.) have tapped the vein more effectively than their norm with enjoyable details and on-the-mark senseless brutality. Even its slack pacing a it often feels as if its holding for laughs a recalls its sources. Moody teen Becca (newcomer Jenn Proske) drives into Sporks Wash. listening to anguished emo ""Nobody gets me a|"" The filmmakers ape the series style and even skewer its protagonists lack of personality Becca declares shes ""humorless"" and a jock pops up with ""Damn girl you seem really boring and frigid; you want to go to the prom?"" Then she meets Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter) and its all fangs and angst.Proske nails her Kristen Stewart mimicry down to the lower-lip bite and throws a fine forest-floor tantrum. She may be the films strongest suit but its trump card is Ken Jeong in Volturi drag; the ""Hangover"" and ""Community"" star has reached the level of getting laughs just for showing up. The hair and makeup departments do yeomans work a ""Twilight"" star Robert Pattinson has quipped that most of his performance is the hair; the effectiveness of Lanters gloomy parody makes that seem less of a joke.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFast amp; Furious parody SuperFast sticks close to homeOctober 30 2013A witless sampler is `Epic MovieJanuary 29 2007Another sequel?

Vikram Jayantis BBC production is culled from 50 hours of interviews made during the reclusive Spectors first trial -- he was accused of sticking one of his many guns in actress Lana Clarksons mouth and blowing out her brains -- but its less a documentary than a Top 40 opera. The Agony begins with Spector bitching about the jury and the judge (not fair that he keeps reminding the court that somebody died). Then Jayanti segues -- bang -- to a vintage kinescope of the Ronettes performing songwriter Spectors infectiously plaintive ""Be My Baby."" Pure ecstasy And so it goes for the next 100 minutes as Spectors discourse is interwoven with his greatest hits often played in their glorious entirety. Spectors rage is constant his grudges are boundless (Tony Bennett seems to be a particular bete noire) and his paranoia (persecuted because he created the 60s) is indistinguishable from his self-importance. The artist refers to his early-60s hits as ""little symphonies for the kids"" -- hardly an exaggeration. To have been in junior high school when rhapsodic fugues of yearning like ""Uptown"" or ""Be My Baby"" first poured from the radio is to have a sensibility if not a fantasy life in some way molded by this monster of self-absorption. To see The Agony and the Ecstasy is to be haunted by the specter of that long-ago innocence. (J. Hoberman) (Egyptian Theater) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  BROTHERHOOD The Dutch film Brotherhood which won last years Rome International Film Festival arrives with a scenario that makes it easy to dismiss Two young men both members of a neo-Nazi street gang fall in love. Sounds trashy sounds silly but first-time director Nicolo Donato who wrote the screenplay with Rasmus Birch and a superb ensemble refuse to wink resulting in a film that constantly subverts expectation. Recently dismissed from the Dutch army 22-year-old Lars (Thure Lindhardt) falls in with a small gang of ultranationalist thugs whose leader (Nicolas Bro) sees potential in the smart literate Lars. Eventually Lars is sent to live with Jimmy (David Dencik) the leaders brooding second-in-command in a small house hes remodeling for one of the groups rich patrons. And there as promised the two men slowly fall in love. This still sounds like a potboiler but heres the thing What lingers in the mind about Brotherhood isnt the details of plot but the soulful tension between Lars and Jimmy whose merest glance at one another is a complex mix of passion need and fear. These guys are bigoted and violent and dont in any way deserve redemption but you may find yourself hoping that they find it anyway. (Chuck Wilson) (Sunset 5)GO  A FILM UNFINISHED Does it matter that a young Israeli filmmakers imaginative reconstruction of an abandoned Nazi propaganda film about the Warsaw ghetto is not strictly speaking a documentary? Not if it sets a crucial historical record straight. Discovered by East German archivists after World War II and accepted for decades as one of the few visual documents of life inside the ghetto the 1942 film -- in which rich Jews lived the high life in the ghetto while ignoring or exploiting the suffering of the poor Jews -- was revealed as manipulative distortion once a British film researcher uncovered a fifth reel of outtakes in 1998. Mixing staged scenes with documentary footage of starving or dying Jews the new footage made clear that the Nazis forced more prosperous-looking Jews into service as actors in order to portray the ghetto as a place of unpalatable extremes they created themselves. Filmmaker Yael Hersonski herself the granddaughter of a Warsaw ghetto survivor rebuilt the rough cuts into A Film Unfinished adding commentary from nine survivors as they watch as well as excerpts from ghetto documents and testimony from the only identified Nazi cameraman on the project. The most wrenching testimony comes from an elderly Israeli survivor of the ghetto who watching the film covers her eyes then finds solace in the fact that she has recovered enough humanity to find her past unbearable. (Ella Taylor) (Royal Town Center)GO  JEAN-MICHEL BASQUIAT THE RADIANT CHILD An international art star by 23 and dead from a heroin overdose at 27 Jean-Michel Basquiat was drawn in the words of one curator to ""the romance of the person whose life is so intense its more than he can bear."" In her elegiac tribute Jean-Michel Basquiat The Radiant Child Tamra Davis who became friends with the painter in 1983 mercifully avoids much of the gassy nostalgia that typifies documentaries made about artists in New York in the late 70s and 80s; only one interviewee gushes that ""everybody did everything then."" Instead of the platitudes and fatuous art-world rhetoric that defined the 1996 biopic Basquiat by Julian Schnabel (a blustery talking head here) Davis focuses on fascinating specifics to illuminate the life and work of the man who took in the words of Yale professor Robert Farris Thompson ""all the street energies and translated them into high art."" Centering her film around an interview she shot of the then-25-year-old Basquiat -- beautiful slightly bemused -- in 1985 Davis uses that footage to provide emotional heft. Though marred by erratic production values (the audio is especially crummy) Davis homage -- tender never hagiographic -- also contains some biting analysis of the racism both overt and insidious that Basquiat was up against.

The holder of a 370 million lottery ticket that he cant cash in until after the July 4 holiday Kevin accepts a 100000 loan from a local gangster and proceeds to spend it all in one night. Because Kevin is played by the rapper Bow Wow (nee Lil Bow Wow) its tempting to view this section of the film as aspirational autobiography. This is basically how Bow Wow lives most of the time right? The kids at my screening cheered wildly for every scene of Kevins cash frenzy. It would be pretty sweet to have that much money Credit Lottery Ticket for honesty I guess in never making an argument against being fabulously wealthy. The theme of this formulaic but vibrant comedy could best be described as a paraphrase of Biggies well-worn credo. Mo money mo problems -- but mo money yeah definitely. Lottery Ticket works best when it uses the housing project to orchestrate zany collisions of broad comic types all played by familiar faces the neighborhood gossip (Charlie Murphy); the hysterical granny (Loretta Devine); the avaricious preacher (Mike Epps). Ice Cube plays a retired ex-boxer named Thump and watching him putter around telling stories of bygone days is a sorry reminder of just how very very long its been since Friday the movie that perfected the template from which Lottery Ticket was drawn. (Dan Kois) (Citywide)MAOS LAST DANCER Good films about ballet can be numbered on one hand. And about Chinese dissidents? Ive still got enough fingers to type this review. Based on the memoirs of Li Cunxin Maos Last Dancer means well but it stumbles between genres. Li is played by three actors as he grows from plucky peasant lad in the 70s to grim-faced trainee at a Beijing dance academy to visiting student at the Houston Ballet. (By then 1981 hes portrayed by Chi Cao a Chinese-born dancer with the Birmingham Royal Ballet who can act a little.) Confounded by our cowboy hats materialism and discotheques Li feels more comfortable onstage. And there -- so corny its true -- he gets his big break when a soloist is injured. Don Quixote earns him raves and a convenient blond girlfriend provides the chance for a green-card marriage. Should he stay or should he go? And how will the Chinese government respond if Li defects? Director Bruce Beresford employs many flashbacks in this predictable sentimental tale but has no feel for the dance sequences which lurch into slo-mo for each triumphant jete. There are bits of humor at the margins chiefly from Bruce Greenwood as Lis arch gay ballet master. (Kyle MacLachlans attorney seems like a guest star on Dallas.) The melodrama of a divided family is reliably squeezed for tears but the movies best scene is one that awestruck young Li watches with us There is Baryshnikov dancing on grainy samizdat VHS -- free glorious yet far from home. (Brian Miller) (ArcLight Hollywood Landmark Playhouse Town Center)NANNY MCPHEE RETURNS Disneys dictum that external appearances reflect internal character is promoted by Universals Nanny McPhee Returns. In director Susanna Whites sequel to the 2005 Nanny McPhee the titular ugly nanny (played under unsightly makeup by star/writer Emma Thompson) appears in wartime on the doorstep of Maggie Gyllenhaals harried mother. Gyllenhaals efforts to control three unruly kids and their snooty visiting cousins are complicated by her soldier husbands absence as well as by her sniveling brother-in-laws (Rhys Ifans) attempts to make her sell the poo-covered family farm. Imparting life lessons with a bang from her magic cane Thompsons intimidating caregiver is a charmless snooze. As the childrens bad habits disappear so too do McPhees hairy moles and snaggletooth and just as every book can be judged by its cover in this English countryside-set fable every source that the film futilely strives to emulate proves transparent. Awash in CG pandemonium involving synchronized-swimming pigs and burping birds McPhees latest saga neither conjures the humanistic heart of Babe nor addresses father-son separation issues with the sobriety of The Water Horse. Instead its merely a compendium of photocopied elements cartoonish special effects and easy-bake happily-ever-afters. (Nick Schager) (Citywide) PIRANHA 3-D An earthquake has opened an undersea chasm unleashing a gazillion piranha fish near an Arizona resort town that just happens to be jammed with spring-break partiers anxious to frolic in the pretty blue lake. Horny horror-movie revelers tend to deserve whats coming to them a sentiment French-born director Alexandre Aja embraces with maniacal glee in a third-act massacre thats downright ruthless (as was Ajas debut feature High Tension and his remake of The Hills Have Eyes). The human prey get filleted in 3-D no less a technology thats deployed effectively--as when one piranha or another is plucked from the computer-animated horde and paraded past the moviegoers nose--but also shamelessly as when a naked woman points her breasts directly at the camera and shimmies. Irredeemable and yet the movie written by Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg is too funny and the filmmaking too self-aware to be truly offensive. Some wonder why the Oscar-nominated Elisabeth Shue agreed to star in such obvious trash but maybe when she read the part in the script where the piranha deliver a riotously gruesome but poetically just comeuppance to the storys most egregiously misogynist she laughed her way to saying ""Yes."" (Chuck Wilson)THE SCENESTERS Movies about moviemaking no matter how scathing theyre meant to be often end up simply stroking the machine which in turn transforms barbs into love taps. Writer-director Todd Berger tries to short-circuit that circuitous process The Scenesters also takes aim at the poses and pretensions of L.A.s Eastside (specifically Silver Lake) while satirizing the efforts of an asshole producer and pretentious director to make a documentary about a serial killer. Unfortunately Bergers satire is often toothless rarely pushing beyond the obvious even as his plot becomes more convoluted. The film plays like an in-joke home movie of the very folks it means to send up. When struggling director Wallace Cotton (Berger) is hired as a crime-scene videographer by the L.A.P.D. he meets CSI wannabe Charlie Newton (Blaise Miller) who works for Aftershocks a company that cleans up crime scenes. After Charlie realizes that a series of Eastside murders are related Wallace and his producer talk him into withholding information from the cops while they film a documentary and the body count rises. (In one of the movies best lines Wallace woos Charlie by telling him ""People from all over the world -- from Venice to Berlin to Toronto -- will get to know you"" name-checking locales of three of the worlds largest film festivals.) A love story the history of the dismantling of L.A.s public transit system by the auto industry and a huge red herring are thrown in the mix (as well as John Landis as a judge) but cant charge the films listless pulse. (Ernest Hardy) (Downtown Independent)GO  THE TILLMAN STORY Amir Bar-Levs assiduous furious documentary on the Armys craven cover-up of the death by friendly fire of former NFL player Pat Tillman in Afghanistan in 2004 -- and the exploitation of his corpse for recruitment purposes -- is a withering assessment of U.S. military culture. Unlike recent Afghan war doc Restrepo Bar-Levs film feigns no pretense of ""neutrality."" War is hell the former documentary relentlessly (if unhelpfully) reminds us. But The Tillman Story goes deeper exposing a system of arrogance and duplicity that no WikiLeak could ever fully capture. While members of Tillmans immediate family and his widow Marie are powerful riveting talking heads his mother Mary emerges as the tireless moral compass aided by a former special-ops soldier in decoding 3000 pages of heavily redacted documents about her sons death. Bar-Lev portrays Tillman who read Chomsky and Emerson and shunned professional-athlete megalomania as a fiercely private principled person. For his sacrifice leadership and character his body was hatefully used as propaganda his family lied to and gravely let down by Congress which ultimately let Donald Rumsfeld and several four-star generals off the hook. (Melissa Anderson) (Landmark)VAMPIRES SUCK Writer-director team Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer continue to act as the drain trap to our pop culture toilet. The Date Movie and Meet the Spartans collaborators have made a career of low-overhead channel-surf bricolages catering to ninth-graders with nothing else to do on a Friday night movies not meant to be watched so much as texted during. (Smart money says Friedberg and Seltzer never sit through these movies in entirety.) Their Vampires Suck isnt a spoof of vampire movies as a genre which would demand an audience whose collective memory reached beyond 2008 but of the first two Twilight movies specifically with iconic scenes re-enacted and laced with gags. Many of the films jokes such as they are consist of mentioning the titles of contemporary reality-TV shows which should be a riot for viewers who think that their cable-channel guide is the soul of wit. Jenn Proske provides a reasonable facsimile of Kristen Stewarts soulful lip-gnashing and eyebrow-fluttering and theres a giggle-worthy bit with a Segway but SNLs ""The Franks"" parody had more laughs and the distinct advantage of being only two minutes long. If youve ever read a single book -- well include Stephenie Meyer -- youre probably better than this. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Last summer an enterprising YouTube artist cut together clips from the classic TV show ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer and the first ""Twilight film to create a relationship between Edward Cullen and Buffy. Theres far more creativity in that six-minute video than in all 88 minutes of ""Vampires Suck.It was only a matter of time until Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer the writing-directing duo responsible for a parade of genre film parodies from ""Date Movie to ""Meet the Spartans turned their attention to the ""Twilight franchise. With ""Vampires Suck the film is just as guilty as the vampires.The plot is more like a series of sketches loosely based on scenes from the first two ""Twilight films which lend themselves to pratfalls jokes about Canadians and awkward dance numbers. We follow Becca (Jenn Proske) as she moves to Sporks Wash. with her single father (Diedrich Bader) and there meets sparkly vampire Edward Sullen (""90210 hunk Matt Lanter) and sweet shirtless werewolf Jacob (Chris Riggi). Her time is spent fending off ravenous bloodsuckers and one-dimensional classmates in a quest to find a date to her vampire-themed prom.Most of the jokes involve people getting punched in the face or dated pop-culture references (does anyone care about the Kardashians any more?). The most clever visual gag is a giant cactus that Becca brings to Sporks (""Twilight heroine Bella is from Phoenix). And despite constant jabs at the pro-abstinence theme of the original series ""Vampires Suck is just as buttoned-up. Only one character gets naked -- presumably to maintain the PG-13 rating necessary to attract the ""Twilight crowd.Proske pulls off an amusingly accurate impression of Kristen Stewarts somnambulant Bella complete with flat voiceover and bad posture but shes handicapped by her ability to demonstrate more than one facial expression. Lanter fares better as Edward -- his main responsibilities involve staring and keeping his hair in place. The most fun comes from Ken Jeong who appears near the end. But even in a scarlet cape and ridiculous wig he cant salvage the preceding 80 minutes.The film provides enough recognizable references that Twi-hards with a sense of humor should feel included in the jokes or inspired to make up their own.

This isnt it. In Vampires Suck writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer (Disaster Movie) tackle the material with their usual scattershot aim roping in references to everything from the Jonas Brothers to Jersey Shore for gags that barely even try for humor; most just settle for a momentary jolt of recognition. The exception is newcomer Jenn Proske who spoofs Twilight star Kristen Stewarts flustered hair-tugging angst with hilarious precision.

Starring Ken Jeong Matt Lanter Charlie Weber Marcelle Baer Chris Riggi Wanetah Walmsley Michelle Lang Bradley Dodds Parker Dash Nedal Yousef Director Jason Friedberg Aaron Seltzer Running time 120 Release Opened Aug 18 2010  Editorial Review Vampires Suck does just thatBy Jen ChaneyWednesday Aug. 18 2010Vampires suck? Thats a matter of opinion. But heres what inarguably unequivocally does suck ""Vampires Suck"" a painfully unfunny ""Twilight"" spoof that arrives in theaters Wednesday at least a year too late to seem even semi-culturally relevant. (""This Twilight phenomenon has gotten out of control Vampire movies and TV shows are everywhere"" Hey thanks for the news flash from 2008.) Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer -- the writer-directors that have participated in an ongoing parade of movie-genre parodies including ""Scary Movie"" ""Date Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" -- have set their comedic crosshairs on the most obvious of targets the hugely successful film franchise based on the equally successful novels by Stephenie Meyer all of which have already been dissected debated and yes satirized ad nauseum. Before it even makes its first Team Edward/Team Jacob joke -- a gag that for the record involves a bunch of tween girls bashing each other in the head with shovels -- ""Vampires Suck"" already feels burdened by the weight of the numerous ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" and MTV Movie Awards send-ups that have preceded it. The plot for lack of a better word is based on a pastiche of moments from the first two ""Twilight"" films ""Twilight"" and ""The Twilight Saga New Moon."" Becca (Jenn Proske) -- the ""Vampires Suck"" version of Bella -- moves to a glum little Pacific Northwest town called Sporks -- the ""Vampires Suck"" version of Forks Wash. -- where she listens to teen angst mixes on her iPod engages in desperately awkward conversations with her single father (Diedrich Bader of ""The Drew Carey Show"") and eventually finds herself torn between Edward (Matt Lanter) a vampire who ""looks like hes constipated"" and sparkles improbably in the sunlight and Jacob (Chris Riggi) a kindhearted werewolf who brings her balloon bouquets and is contractually obligated to remove his shirt every 10 minutes. Twi-hards will immediately get all the in-jokes from the riff on Edwards ability to swoosh speedily through the forest (an effort assisted here by the use of a Segway) to the ridiculous performance of ""Its Raining Men"" by the members of Jacobs cut-off-jean-shorts-wearing wolf pack. But they still probably wont laugh much. As for non-""Twilight"" fans ""Vampires Suck"" does its due diligence by tossing in a few more general pop culture gags busting predictably on everyone from the Kardashians to Chris Brown. Again nothing worth busting a gut over here although perhaps the filmmakers deserve credit for their one show of restraint No jokes in this movie have been made at the expense of Justin Bieber. Another somewhat bright note Proskes turn as Becca in which the newcomer absolutely nails the nervous pauses frequent lip-biting and generally twitchy behavior that characterizes Kristen Stewarts portrayal of the perpetually conflicted Bella. Proske has clearly done her homework. She deserves better material to work with and so do a couple of the talented actors who (wisely) appear briefly in ""Vampires Suck"" Ken Jeong of ""The Hangover"" and Dave Foley of ""The Kids in the Hall."" These individuals know funny. And they should have known better than to spend time in a flick that wouldnt recognize funny if it came up and sank both of its fangs into its uninspired neck.Contains sexual content comic violence language and teen partying.

"Vampires Suck Spoof bites and not in a good way | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesVampires Suck Spoof bites and not in a good wayTo the creators of ""Twilight"" spoof ""Vampire Sucks"" fangs but no fangs.Vampires Suck the latest satire from writer/directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer lampoons the Twilight movies.  (HANDOUT)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterWed. Aug. 18 2010Vampires Suck (out of 4)Starring Jenn Proske Matt Lanter. Directed by Jason Friedberg Aaron Seltzer. 85 minutes. At major theatres. PGTo the creative team behind Vampires Suck we have a simple message fangs but no fangs.Writer/directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer the brain trust behind such spoofs as Date Movie Epic Movie and Disaster Movie have come up with another drearily pointless parody this time lampooning the Twilight series of movies (actually just the first two Twilight and New Moon).Article Continued BelowThe movie opened Wednesday without prescreening for critics.In the Friedberg/Seltzer parallel universe of ripping off other peoples movies Bella um rather Becca (Jenn Proske) arrives in the permanently overcast town of Sporks Wash. where the local dentist advertises ""Brighter Bites"" and a derelict holds up a sign ""Will Work for Blood."" She soon meets up with Edward Cullen oops sorry Sullen (Matt Lanter) and soon theyre both deeply in the throes of unrequited love.Proske as Bella oops Becca actually has some fun with the role constantly tucking her hair behind her ears looking moody and projecting existential teenage angst throughout. Lanters pompadoured Edward isnt quite as successful though he has an impressive six-pack.Friedberg and Seltzer use the same dreamy aerial shots slow-mo action sequences and overwrought adolescent emotions -- pretty much the same everything from the original Twilight -- which makes one wonder why they bothered in the first place. Oh right to be funny.Along the way they get in digs at Tiger Woods rapper Chris Brown Lady Gaga George Clooney and the Jonas Brothers. Throw in some buff and shirtless werewolf dudes and jokes related to farts blow-up sex dolls constipation Canadians a juggling routine involving an apple a bowling ball and a baby and some salty language and youve got something that if it was a board game would have a notice on the side of the box saying ""appropriate for ages 6 to 10.""Parodies can be hilarious.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download Vampires Suck -- Film Review 1002 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Frank Scheck  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS ""Vampires Suck"" Empty TWITTER Empty Parody specialists Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have found their formula and are sticking with it despite what any of the rest of us might think. The duo responsible for such stinkers as ""Date Movie"" ""Epic Movie"" and ""Disaster Movie"" now have turned their puny sights on the rabid pop culture phenomenon of sexy vampires. Or rather just the ""Twilight"" series as this effort would be more accurately titled ""Twilight Sucks."" Ignoring such contemporary bloodsucker-themed hits as HBOs ""True Blood"" and the CWs ""The Vampire Diaries"" not to mention stalwarts like Dracula or the works of Anne Rice this witless spoof instead merely provides an unfunny scene-by-scene retread of the first two movies in the hugely successful franchise.Thus it dutifully trots out slightly renamed versions of the iconic ""Twilight"" characters including the romantically torn Becca (Jenn Proske) and her dueling suitors the taciturn vampire Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter) and hunky werewolf Jacob White (Chris Riggi).If you think Jacob peeing on a tree or Becca farting in Edwards face when he attempts to climb into bed with her are the height of comic wit then youre clearly of the adolescent mind-set to which these films cater. The director-screenwriters clearly aware of their target audiences lack of sophistication are not even ashamed to trot out such hoary gags as when a horde of vampires hungrily devour Chinese food and Edward observes that theyll be hungry again in a half-hour.As theyve done with all their efforts they also inject an endless amount of current pop-culture references as possible in this case with gags devoted to ""Jersey Shore"" the Kardashians Lindsay Lohan Tiger Woods Chris Brown and Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland."" (To their credit they also bite the hand that feeds them in the form of a dig directed at Fox News).Theres a joke or broad sight gag every 15 seconds or so but the ratio of hits to misses is nearly nonexistent. The sole truly funny bit riffing on the homoerotic subtext of the werewolves penchant for constantly exposing their chiseled torsos features Jacob and his fellow lycanthropes bursting into an exuberant dance routine to the song ""Its Raining Men."" The main performers do a reasonably good job of parodying the ""Twilight"" leads with Proske particularly effective in subtly lampooning Kristen Stewarts moody mannerisms.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Praising the reviled filmmaking team of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer creators of the Scary/Date/Epic/Disaster Movie spoofs is something like doling out encouragement to small children. Just as tykes are regularly praised for tying their own shoes picking out clothes and going to the potty all by themselves the Friedberg/Seltzer juggernaut of awfulness that is Vampires Suck merits commendation for such non-triumphs as telling a relatively coherent story settling on one genre as a satirical target and conveying a knowledge of its source material that goes beyond stumbling across it while channel-surfing or seeing it turn up under ""Trending"" on Twitter. The boys similarly deserve very minor props for choosing a satirical target that lends itself to satire the glum self-important Twilight novels and movies. Sadly thats where the filmmakers mild accomplishments end and the groaningly predictable hackwork begins. Newcomer Jenn Proske nails Kristen Stewarts trademark look of sullen dead-eyed self-pity as a moody teenager who moves to a small town where a sizable percentage of the high-school students appear to be undead ghouls. Proske is instantly infatuated with pale big-haired Robert Pattinson proxy Matt Lanter but shes also attracted to Chris Riggi a lovesick werewolf whose dog-like qualities grow more pronounced as the film progresses. Friedberg/Seltzer capture Twilights trembling earnestness and its recurring narrative and visual motifs (endless helicopter shots of lush forests for example) only to use them as a crude framework for the same old lowest-common-denominator wackiness. The films most ambitious jokes find the cast foregrounding the subtext of the Twilight mythology in dialogue (like the central romance providing the ultimate safe fantasy for virginal girls) but mostly the filmmakers fall back on ineptly executed pratfalls gags involving violence against women (Proske in particular takes a beating) and clumsily integrated references to such already-dated pop-culture ephemera as Chris Brown and Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The filmmakers capture the Twilight aesthetic to such an extent that the films dour tone robs it of any energy or comic momentum. Vampires Suck finds Friedberg-Seltzer evolving ever so slightly but adequacy remains out of their grasp and mediocrity might just be an impossible goal. Oh well at least the quest for non-terribleness gives them something to shoot for.

Photo Alan Markfield Twentieth Century Fox Review Vampires Suck 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Vampires Suck Comedy. Starring Jenn Proske Diedrich Bader and Matt Lanter. Directed by Adam Seltzer and Jacob Friedberg. (PG-13. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The makers of ""Epic Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" have a new film out and its probably their best work to date. Thats most definitely a backhanded compliment but the fact that ""Vampires Suck"" is a step above god-awful is something of a miracle. Its like watching the kid who always turns in nothing but a blank paper suddenly score a C-minus on his chemistry final. One has to wonder if he was looking at someone elses paper ... For those who have missed this recent string of ""Airplane""-without-the-funny spoof movies the formula is very simple Writer-directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg take a movie genre that is popular with young people cast inexpensive actors then insert a ton of slapstick gross-out scenes and apropos-of-nothing jokes involving whatever celebrities are trending the highest on Twitter. ""Vampires Suck"" has all of this and more passing off as humor a baby getting hit by a bowling ball and threats of bodily harm against a man in a wheelchair. A compound fracture is used as a punch line then shown again and again as if the sight of someones spine sticking out of their neck can only get funnier. Whats most disappointing isnt the obviousness of the humor but how dated some of it is. The Segway scooter was a decent sight gag - the first 10000 times it was used in film and television. ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" should have been the official retirement. ""Vampires Suck"" looks as if it cost less than the typical Bon Jovi video to make mines gay stereotypes (werewolves in cut-off jeans singing ""Its Raining Men"") and manages not a single memorable joke at the expense of the easiest target in the world Stephenie Meyer fans. And yet ... there are small signs of progress here. Maybe its the ""Twilight"" movies source material which has long since become self-parody making it easier to lampoon. ""Vampires Suck"" is more focused than this teams other efforts spending at least 65 percent of the screen time making fun of one movie. Several of the actors have decent comic timing even when theres very little material to work with. (Diedrich Bader does the most with the least playing the town sheriff Frank.) The high points? Theres a semi-funny joke at the expense of the Black-Eyed Peas. Dave Foley keeps his streak alive - hes appeared in every crappy movie of the 21st century for at least two minutes. And the running time is a merciful 80 minutes. Thats the one reliably great thing about reviewing bad movies Almost all of the biggest losers are less than an hour and a half long. -- Advisory This film contains sexual content violence strong language and humor at the expense of your favorite celebrity. (Justin Bieber is somehow spared; presumably those jokes will be a DVD bonus feature.)

Vampires Suck Bomb to bad Director Jason Friedberg Aaron Seltzer. Cast Jenn Proske Matt Lanter Chris Riggi. Rating Rated PG-13 for crude sexual content comic violence language and teen partying. Movie spoofs take aim Vampire movies | Werewolf movies Vampire hunks | Off with their shirts The movie is written and directed by two guys who have dealt in this kind of material before Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer also have ""Date Movie"" ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"" on their resumes so they apparently know what their audience wants. The film operates with lots of Mad magazine-style puns and gags. Bella is Becca; vampire clan the Cullens become the Sullens; and the Washington town of Forks is now Sporks. Its all very silly but only occasionally generates laughs. Newcomer Jenn Proske effectively nails Kristen Stewarts nervous tics and halting speech and the directors have fun poking at the original films overheated moodiness One playlist on Beccas iPod is labeled ""Teen Angst Mix."" Unfortunately thats about the cleverest thing youre going to find here. The rest of it is aggressively dumb which isnt such a sin. But it is mostly unfunny and thats living death in a movie like this. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

"Movie Review Vampires Suck - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Teen Wolf Movie Review Vampires SuckAugust 19 2010|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterIf Kristen Stewart ever saw ""Vampires Suck"" shed be scarred for life. No name newcomer Jenn Proske has K Stew down pat -- from her fluttering downcast eyes to her crooked little lip-biting trick even the mannered way Miss ""Twilight"" fiddles with her hair. Seriously Miss Proske well done. Pity the movie she pulls of this mean uncanny impersonation in bears the too apt title ""Vampires Suck."" Its from the duo who gave us ""Disaster Movie"" and ""Date Movie"" and ""Meet the Spartans"" and a lot of other lame parodies that Fox unleashes whenever theres a dead spot on the cinema calendar. Late August certainly qualifies. ""Suck"" is a straight ""Twilight"" parody a scene-by-scene vamp of the Stephenie Meyer vampire movies with the odd ""True Blood"" ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ""Gossip Girl"" Kardashian and Lady Gaga gag tossed in. Even by the standards of these movies which rely on an onslaught of jokey references -- a couple a minute -- to float ""Suck"" sinks. Edward ( Matt Lanter) and ""Becca"" (Proske) are the ill-fated lovers this time. Edwards family? The ""Sullens."" They all live in ""Sporks"" Washington where the teen girl motto is ""Once you go bat you never go back."" Jacob the teen wolf (Chris Riggi) has been reduced to a shirtless gay joke. Its the sort of movie where ""finger food"" is offered at a party. And its fingers. Haw. A few snarky remarks about ""teen angst"" a funny spoiler scene where characters walk out of a ""Twilight"" movie and give away the plot to the whole series cracks about Edwards ""big hair and constipated look"" thats about it. Winter Park native Arielle Kebel (""Aquamarine"") is one of the fanged fiends. Diedrich Bader and Ken Jeong are the only other faces I recognized. Jeong whose screen appearances were in order ""The Hangover"" "" Role Models "" ""The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard "" ""All About Steve"" ""Couples Retreat"" ""Furry Vengeance"" and now this needs a better agent. Thats not a career tumble thats a plummet. And Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Guys youre making this parody business look awfully hard. So much to work with and this is the best you could come up with? See for Yourself Vampires Suck Cast Matt Lanter Diedrich Bader Ken Jeong. Directors Aaron Seltzer Jason Friedberg Running time 1 hour 25 minutes Industry Rating PG-13 for crude sexual content comic violence language and teen partying.

After the excruciating imbecility of their previous free-form laugh-free genre parodies -- ""Date Movie"" ""Meet the Spartans"" and ""Disaster Movie"" -- the lame mediocrity of ""Vampires Suck"" undeniably reps an advance for writer-directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. By just about any other standard however this instantly forgettable trifle is fairly close to worthless. Brandishing obvious gags uninventive slapstick and stale pop-culture allusions the filmmakers only occasionally hit the bulls-eye while aiming at assorted easy targets provided by the teen angst and supernatural bloodletting of the ongoing ""Twilight"" franchise. Expect a fleeting theatrical run before interment in Redbox kiosks. Set in the Pacific Northwest hamlet of Sporks Wash. -- played in a bold stroke of casting by Shreveport La. -- ""Vampires Suck"" pivots on the odd coupling of Becca Crane (Jenn Proske) the beautiful sourpuss daughter of the local sheriff (Diedrich Bader) and Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter) an equally moody pale-complexioned hunk. They look great together especially during moments of slo-mo staring and have several things in common (insecurities nervous tics severe melancholia borderline-nonexistent social skills). Unfortunately theres a serious impediment to the happily-ever-aftering Hes like sort of a vampire. Not that Becca isnt totally cool with that. But some members of Edwards extended family -- and at least three other bloodsuckers in the vicinity -- would like to tap her like a keg at a frat party. All things considered she might be better off with Jacob White (Chris Riggi) a muscular classmate and budding werewolf who tries to romance Becca when hes not chasing stray cats. Although appreciably more focused than earlier efforts by Friedberg and Seltzer -- this time theyre content to skewer only three or four pics rather than five or six dozen -- ""Vampires Suck"" finds time for jokey references to the usual number of overexposed celebrities (Tiger Woods Kim Kardashian ad nauseam) and TV shows. (Rest assured there is a nod to ""Jersey Shore."") The only real surprise considering this is a Fox release is a modestly clever dig at Fox News. The well-cast lead players struggle mightily to remain at once earnest and over the top with uneven results. Comic actor Ken Jeong is criminally underused in a supporting role as slumming vampire royalty but his exuberant silliness is good for a few giggles. Tech values are marginally better than might be expected. Vampires SuckProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a Regency Enterprises presentation of a New Regency/3 in the Box production.
