"Review Cast brings Role Models home - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Cast brings Role Models homeStory Highlights ""Role Models"" works because of very funny cast Film concerns two men who have to work with at-risk kids Paul Rudd Seann William Scott Jane Lynch rise above formula Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Its probably fair to say that no one goes to a Seann William Scott movie in anticipation of anything more than a few laughs and a quick exit. And on that score ""Role Models"" doesnt disappoint. In ""Role Models"" two men become big brothers to two troubled children. A few of us however cling to higher hopes from Paul Rudd and his ""Wet Hot American Summer"" director David Wain -- at least to add a smidge of irony to the comedy. As far as that goes this is more of a mixed bag but you take your pleasures where you can find them. An off-the-rack buddy movie refitted for the current craze for ""men-will-be-bros"" hijinks Wains comedy has the kind of scenario you could scribble in crayon on the back of a napkin -- and frankly it wouldnt be a surprise if thats exactly how it came to pass even if took half a dozen credited writers to accomplish the task. Enervated energy drink pitchmen Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) get on the wrong side of the law and are faced with a choice of 30 days in jail or 150 hours of community service with the ""Sturdy Wings"" big brother agency. Neither is exactly role model material -- Wheeler is a party animal obsessed with the ladies while Danny is careering head on into full-blown depression after getting his marching orders from long-term girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks making minimal impression in a thankless role albeit her third release in three weeks). Jail doesnt seem out of the question when these ""Bigs"" -- in Sturdy Wings terminology -- meet their ""littles"" Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) is a 10-year-old with a mouth like Eddie Murphy and an attitude like Mike Tyson. Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse -- McLovin from ""Superbad"") is a tongue-tied loner who goes around in a cloak carrying a foam broadsword and who lives for a weekly fantasy role-playing tournament. By now you may be thinking the prospect of hard time in the slammer sounds more enjoyable than 90 minutes watching ""Role Models."" And if were talking about one of those minimum-security facilities reserved for Wall Street embezzlers thats likely true. Dont Miss Paul Rudd Role Model? He doubts it But there are compensations and chief among them is the hilarious Jane Lynch -- who brightened ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" as the store manager and any number of Christopher Guest films -- as the founder and manager of Sturdy Wings. Her character is a deliciously sidelong riff on a familiar kind of reformed drug addict who now proclaims herself ""addicted to helping"" and who stays on the boys case with the disconcertingly earnest insistence that ""you cant BS a bull-sher."" The role is scarcely more than a vignette but Lynch somehow contrives to sneak off with yet another Generation XY male-bonding movie. Other material is familiar Wheeler and Ronnie get on the same page when the subject turns to breasts; Danny and Augie win their princesses through old-fashioned chivalry. Rudd and Scott arent stretching any new muscles but Rudds glum disaffection and Scotts bozo bonhomie do gel with a satisfying stickiness. They handle the gaping innuendo with such delicacy we know that they know theyre better than this. Further down the cast list Ken Jeong comes up with some choice stylings as a haughty role-playing royal. But like it or not I have a feeling the character people are going to be quoting afterwards is young master Thompsons precociously potty-mouthed badass who reserves his worst slur for Rudd ""Reindeer Games."" Take that Ben Affleck This unremittingly juvenile comedy routine may be getting a little old but unlike a tweener like ""Drillbit Taylor"" at least ""Role Models"" has the decency to earn its R rating. And truth be told its cast wrings more juice out of the script than it deserves. If only that were a model for other movies of its type. ""Role Models"" is rated R and runs 99 minutes.

After Knocked Up and Pineapple Express (to name but two) Role Models arrives as yet another tale of directionless thirtysomethings who are forced into awkward situations and stumble across the meaning of life. When this formula is poorly handled (as with the recent Zack and Miri) it can be excruciatingly shallow and crass. But when it works it can make for genuine heartfelt comedy gold. Role Models works.Hauled in by the cops following a rampant energy juice bender Danny (Paul Rudd) and Wheeler (a mercifully restrained Seann William Scott) are sentenced to 150 hours of community service in the company of two troubled kids hyperactive foul-mouthed ten-year-old Ronnie (Bobbe J Thompson) and role-playing Dungeons amp; Dragons nerd Augie (Christopher McLovin Mintz-Plasse). The usual hi-jinks ensue before everyone learns and grows and hugs and Rudd sings a song.So far so predictable. But who cares when the script is tight the jokes clever and numerous the characters rounded and likeable and the soundtrack studded with 70s rock classics? Added value comes in the form of some spectacularly off-the-wall cameo appearances most notably Jane Lynch in another brittle worrying performance as an ex-cokehead turned protector of children.Role Models isnt trying to reinvent the wheel just polish it up a little. What emerges is a memorable slice of modern slapstick with charm to spare and just a touch of soul.

I normally agree with the Timeout reviews but this guy has totally missed the mark... the jokes clever and numerous...rubbish you could barely call it a comedy it was mildly amusing at times but the story was so predictable and dull you wont feel much like laughing. Believe me youve seen this story a million times before... a guy having a mid-life crisis whos girlfriend dumps him and he tries to get her back and a geeky kid trying to gain popularity status. You wont be surprised how the story ends in fact youll predict it half way through the movie while your bored mind starts to wander. This is essentially a kids movie disguised as something different by throwing a shed load of swearing and titty jokes into the mix. Teenagers and dumb people will enjoy it anyone with a brain will see it for what it is... not in the least bit clever or funny.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 24 2009BeejFeaturedDidnt enjoy this film at all.

A prototypical summer release dropped into early November this furiously raunchy occasionally bright and eventually benumbing comedy stars Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott as buddies forced to become mentors in a crackpot version of a Big Brother program run by a not-so-former crack addict. (At one point in its development the film was called ""Mentors"" but the marketing people may have worried that the target audience wouldnt know what mentors do.) The programs director is played by Jane Lynch who was memorably funny as Steve Carells libidinous boss in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin."" Like everyone else in this cast she has been directed by David Wain to sell an attitude -- the gleeful cynicism of a hustler who cant be hustled. Like everyone else she ends up wearing out her welcome by overselling her wares. But then the target audience isnt shopping for understatement. ENLARGE From left to right Christopher Mintz-Plasse Paul Rudd Seann William Scott and Bobbe J. Thompson in a scene from ""Role Models."" Associated Press What it gets at the outset is glib flip and quick -- qualities to be admired in the genre and especially in a movie with a relatively short running time of 99 minutes. Danny played by Paul Rudd (another graduate of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"") and Wheeler played by Seann William Scott (the manic Stifler of the ""American Pie"" films) work as sales reps for a supercharged energy drink called Minotaur. When they overindulge in their product and wreck their company truck their next stop is court-ordered participation in Sturdy Wings the smarmy institution of lower relearning where Wheeler a foulmouthed party animal is assigned to mentor a robotically foulmouthed fifth-grader named Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) while Danny a stickler for language pairs off with Augie a 16-year-old refugee from reality whos obsessed with his role in a flesh-and-blood fantasy variant of Dungeons amp; Dragons. (Hes played unsubtly by Christopher Mintz-Plasse who was the delightfully nerdy Fogell in ""Superbad."") Holiday Movie Preview The buddydom is initially done deftly Mr. Rudd gives Danny an intriguing air of detachment that turns to despair after hes dumped by his gorgeous lawyer girlfriend. (Shes played by still another ""Virgin"" graduate Elizabeth Banks.) But something bizarre starts to happen around the halfway mark perhaps because no one knew how to develop the original premise. The fantasy game a wildly overproduced outdoor free-for-all takes over the film. Some of it is amusing -- the games aesthetic borrows liberally from the rock band Kiss -- but as those 99 minutes threatened to become a mini-eternity I found myself wondering why I was watching a screwy kid doing battle with a fey king and his medieval chain-mailed knights. But then Im not the target audience. ENLARGE Alex the lion (the voice of Ben Stiller) Melman the giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) in ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" DreamWorks Watch a scene from the upcoming animated film ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. (Nov. 6) Madagascar Escape 2 Africa ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa"" continues the saga of the plucky animals who in the 2005 animation hit escaped from the Central Park Zoo and landed in the island nation of Madagascar. This time attempting to return to New York aboard a rickety airplane piloted by penguins they survive a crash landing in Africa. At first they mistake their ancestral cradle for San Diego or possibly New Jersey but theres no mistaking the new film for Pixar. We are once again deep in DreamWorks territory where story and characters serve mainly as pretexts for clever riffs on familiar pop-cultural themes and a visual style that soars beyond prettiness into sustained radiance. ""Its like Roots "" says Marty the zebra as the African adventure unfolds. The roots are shallow but the sequel is good-natured high-spirited and perfectly enjoyable if you take it for what it is. Its less a product of inspiration than accretion. Grown-ups with a memory for movies will tick off the sources and references ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" in which an aircraft was built from salvaged pieces (an apt metaphor for the film as a whole); ""Gladiator"" or the world of professional wrestling as the model for a rite of leonine passage endured by Alex the uncertain lion hero voiced by Ben Stiller. Little kids will be stirred by Alexs reunion with his parents; by his desperate efforts to gain their approval; by the love of Melman the giraffe for Gloria the hippo; and by Sacha Baron Cohens virtuoso performance as once again the voice of Julien the lemur. Juliens colloquy with the gods of a volcano is only the product of his perfervid imagination but its inspired as distinct from accreted. The Boy in the Striped Pajamas ENLARGE Childs Play Jack Scanlon (left) and Asa Butterfield in ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."" Miramax Films Watch a scene from the film ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas."" Video courtesy of Miramax Films. (Nov. 6) ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"" was directed by Mark Herman who adapted the script from a novel by John Boyne. The film succeeds to the degree that it does -- partially but honorably and sometimes affectingly -- because it was made as well as it was. (The cinematographer was Benoit Delhomme.) The central character Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is the eight-year-old son of a Nazi officer in World War II. When the father becomes commandant of a concentration camp the family moves from Berlin to a rather stylish house with Bauhaus lines on the edge of the camp. Soon Brunos explorations lead him to the camps barbed-wire perimeter which he takes to be the fence of some sort of farm where the farmers and their children choose to wear for some odd reason striped pajamas. Then one of those children Shmuel the boy of the title who is played by Jack Scanlon edges close to his side of the fence and becomes Brunos friend. Brunos misunderstanding is a given that you will either reject as cloyingly false naivete or accept as a device for retelling the Holocaust story from a new perspective. Though I wavered between the two I came down more often than not on the side of acceptance at least at the outset; the movie has strengths that often outweigh the contrivance. The main strength is Asa Butterfields fine performance as Bruno. Another is the language spoken by an excellent cast that includes David Thewlis as Brunos father and Vera Farmiga as his mother. The entire movie is in English but matter-of-fact almost prosaic English that paradoxically confers a convincing dailiness on the familys life and on Brunos slow realization of what his father -- and by extension the Nazis -- are doing in the camp. That said the development of Brunos friendship with Shmuel pushes plausibility to the breaking point. For one thing the Jewish boy looks more like a victim of indigestion than malnutrition his ashen face notwithstanding. For another the plot contrivances -- including a betrayal evocative of ""The Kite Runner"" -- cross the line into naked manipulation. When Bruno makes an effort to set things right the film goes powerfully wrong. Find TV listings at LocateTV. DVD Tip ENLARGE Universal/Everett Collection Weve seen lots of Elizabeth Banks lately and thats a good thing even if her recent films -- ""W."" and ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" -- havent deserved her. She deserved to have more screen time in ""Seabiscuit"" (2003) but she made the most of her minor role Marcela Howard (right) the second wife of the horses owner whos played by Jeff Bridges.

Thompson.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 07 2008At some point in the not-too-distant future the whole stupid-guys-doing-stupid-things-before-finding- redemption-and-a-girlfriend comedy is going to implode in a deja vu moment of profound multiplex ennui. But until that time - and that movie - comes along Hollywood isnt about to stop making sex-on-the-brain self-improvement comedies like Role Models. And Paul Rudd (Knocked Up Forgetting Sarah Marshall) and Seann William Scott (Old School the American Pies) arent about to stop starring in them either. Here Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) are Los Angeles buddies who hawk an energy drink called Minotaur to school kids. Presenting it as a healthy alternative to getting high - Wheeler in a minotaur costume Danny the straight guy with the ""Just say no to drugs"" mantra - they tool around town cynically selling this green caffeine/ginseng junk to tweens and teens. Wheelers happy with the gig It gives him plenty of time to pursue the ladies. But Danny in his mid-30s is feeling miserable He hates his job and complains incessantly to lawyer girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks - her third movie in as many weeks after W. and Zack and Miri Make a Porno). A trip to a chain coffee place where Danny goes into a rant about the tall/grande/venti sizing system offers a (funny) illustration of just how sour and curmudgeonly hes become. And then the day it falls apart. Beth breaks up with Danny and Danny and Wheeler crash their Minotaur-mobile destroying public property in the process. In lieu of jail Beth negotiates community service Danny and Wheeler must spend 150 hours in a Big Brothers-like outfit called Sturdy Wings. Danny gets a dweeby fantasy game obsessive Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse Superbads McLovin) as his protege. Wheeler gets Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) a foul-mouthed fatherless 10-year-old. Role Models written by a bunch of folks (including Rudd) is directed by David Wain late of the comedy troupe The State and director of Wet Hot American Summer and The Ten. Its pretty formulaic stuff and earns its R rating with profanity and unapologetically gratuitous female nudity but somehow has a winning knuckleheaded charm. Jane Lynch just about steals the show with her performance as the garrulous head of Sturdy Wings - a woman who wears her own addictions (cocaine) like a badge of honor. (Or like a billboard.) This recovering addict doesnt think much of Danny and Wheeler and the two goof-offs dont behave in a manner to make her think otherwise. At least not at first. A live-action loopy medieval-battle role-playing event is without a doubt where Role Models delivers the most laughs Danny and Wheeler with their two young charges join the nerdy armor-clad throng in a Los Angeles park crossing swords striking down the enemy armies and addressing one another as ""thou"" and ""my liege.""

That Role Models includes all three while still providing a half-decent storyline and characters worth caring about rates as a major achievement.By JASON ANDERSONspecial to the starFri. Nov. 7 2008Starring Paul Rudd Seann William Scott and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Directed by David Wain. 98 minutes. At major theatres. 14AThere are three things that every modern screen comedy needs references to old KISS songs guys dressed as knights whacking each other with foam swords and a potty-mouthed 10-year-old. That Role Models includes all three while still providing a half-decent storyline and characters worth caring about rates as a major achievement.The first mainstream foray by the team behind the 2001 cult fave Wet Hot American Summer - a crew that includes star and co-writer Paul Rudd - Role Models attempts to create the same balance of raunchiness and sweetness that made The 40 Year Old Virgin and Knocked Up so well loved. Though a little too ambling and erratic to match the best efforts of Judd Apatow it still hits the mark more often than not. Role Models is especially appealing as a showcase for Rudds finely tuned sarcasm. He plays Danny Donahue an energy-drink salesman whose dismal outlook on life does not improve when hes dumped by girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks completing a fall-movie trifecta after roles in W. and Zack and Miri Make a Porno). Depressed and wired on his own product he crashes the company truck in an incident that nets him and co-worker Wheeler (Seann William Scott) a court-ordered spell of community service. Article Continued BelowUnder the auspices of a Big Brothers-like organization led by an over-caring ex-addict (Jane Lynch) they are assigned to two kids in need of father figures. A hedonistic slacker whos slightly less obnoxious than Scotts best-known character - Stifler in the American Pie franchise - Wheeler gets more than he can handle when hes assigned Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) a ""boobie""-obsessed 10-year-old hell raiser with a remarkably prodigious capacity for cuss words. As for Danny he must make time for Augie (Superbads Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a dorky teen who only really feels himself when dressed up as a knight and doing battle in live-action role-playing games.The fact that the movie largely resists the temptation to use Augie and his foam-wielding friends as easy targets of ridicule is one indication of Role Models generous spirit toward its characters. Indeed the movie lacks the meanness and misanthropy that mars many comedies of its ilk.And though Role Models surprisingly earnest lessons about responsibility loyalty and friendship hamper the movies momentum in the middle stretch it is not impaired by the same sentimental streak that left Zack and Miri Make a Porno so limp. But the biggest reason that Role Models is so satisfying is that its relentlessly funny. Wheelers monologue to Ronnie about the essential appeal of KISS and the true meaning of ""Love Gun"" is both hilarious and chillingly accurate. Dannys attempt to woo back Beth with movie lines - a roster that includes not just ""You had me at hello"" but ""Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters"" - is equally memorable. Even more impressive is how often director David Wain is able to put a fresh spin on an age-old trope children + swear words = comedy gold. Parents may be grateful that their own progeny dont talk the same blue streak as Ronnie does but even they might wish that every Hollywood comedy had a kid with that kind of mouth.

"Role Models reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Role Models reviewed. Role Models reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 6 2008 455 PM Role Models Paul Rudd + cult sketch director = funny movie. By Dana Stevens Elizabeth Banks and Paul Rudd in Role Models Role Models (Universal) is funnier than it has any right to be. Its the first mainstream movie from David Wain a veteran of the comedy troupe the State who previously directed two sketch-based cult films Wet Hot American Summer and The Ten. Perhaps in an attempt to avoid making another collection of randomly stitched-together skits Wain has Role Models neatly following the classic arc of the buddy comedy Two guys trapped together by fate execute one stupid decision after another before finally realizing that hey maybe they could actually accomplish something if they stopped being such schmucks. Like any formula it can work if done well and Role Models is strewn with enough serendipities to make it a worthy variation on the dudes-grow-up genre. For 10 years Danny (Paul Rudd) has held down the same soul-draining job visiting schools to hawk an energy drink called Minotaur with his wastrel of a co-worker Wheeler (Seann William Scott). Danny is burned out emotionally remote and virtually incapable of a nonsarcastic utterance. On the day that his live-in girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) finally breaks up with him he acts out by damaging some public property with the giant Minotaur-shaped truck he and Wheeler drive to work. Advertisement In lieu of a jail term the miscreants are sentenced to community service as volunteers at a Big Brother-style mentoring program run by recovering addict Gayle Sweeney (the thoroughly nutty Jane Lynch a regular Christopher Guest player). Dannys assigned to Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a hopeless teenage dweeb obsessed with medieval role-playing games while Wheeler gets Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) a fatherless 10-year-old with a foul mouth and serious anger issues. The middle section of the movie in which Danny dispiritedly phones in his big-brothering performance has most of the best jokes (at least up until the weirdly exhilarating final action sequence which Ill leave unspoiled except to note that it involves both LARP and KISS). Rudd is the rare actor who can make disengagement engaging. His depressed affectless Danny remains likable even as he rejects all attempts at human connection. (""Its not you"" he assures Augies parents as he turns down their dinner invitation. ""I just hate having dinner with people."") Mintz-Plasse who played the similarly nerdy McLovin in Superbad gets across Augies neediness without compromising the characters dignity. And though Seann William Scott seems to have only one character in his repertoire--the glazed-eyed full-throttle party animal--he plays it with a manic energy thats a fine foil for Rudds anomie. I found the Ronnie character gratingly Gary Coleman-esque but the rest of the audience seemed to love his R-rated non sequiturs. Especially after Kevin Smiths emotionally stunted Zack and Miri Make a Porno its nice to see a dirty-minded romantic comedy (is there any other kind of romantic comedy these days?) in which the sweetness doesnt seem slapped onto the raunch like bad store-bought icing. Role Models may not set its sights very high but it comes by its emotional payoff honestly. And why isnt Paul Rudd in greater demand as a romantic comedy lead? Hes handsome funny and smart (he co-wrote this movie with Wain and many of his best lines sound like on-set improvisation) yet he always seems to be hanging around the corners of other peoples movies (the lovelorn co-worker in The 40-Year-Old Virgin the stoned surf instructor in Forgetting Sarah Marshall). In the last scene of Role Models Rudd turns one of the oldest tricks in the rom-com playbook--the public serenading of ones lady--into a thoroughly satisfying ending. Itd be even more satisfying if this movie got him the plum comic roles he deserves. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Photo Sam Urdank Universal Pictures Movie review Role Models 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Role Models Comedy. Starring Paul Rudd Seann William Scott Elizabeth Banks and Jane Lynch. Directed by David Wain. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The misconception about guy comedies is that theyre all about boobs and male bonding and dudes making bongs out of Sprite cans. The best ones in recent years have possessed a sensitive side thats almost as strong as films from the other side of the cinematic spectrum. (Which would be Nicholas Sparks dramas? Or Lifetime channel movies?) Heroes of guy comedies might have multiple sexual conquests and celebrate insensitive behavior but in the end romance responsibility and a pursuit of monogamy usually prevails. The movie doesnt work if the men in the audience dont feel OK about going home to their girlfriends and wives when the final credits stop rolling. ""Role Models"" doesnt reach the heights of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" in the guy comedy pantheon mostly because it doesnt even try for a cohesive narrative in the first two-thirds of the film. But its still a funny and twisted movie from beginning to end closing with an emotional payoff that matches the classic films of the genre. Fake some allergies before you go in so your wingman wont think youre crying. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are Danny and Wheeler two employees at a company that sells energy drinks - mostly by going to schools and claiming that theyre a safe alternative to drugs. Wheeler is the optimistic one and Danny hates everything. An obvious plot device of a criminal act sends the friends to Sturdy Wings a mentorship program for kids where teen uberdork Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and younger tough kid Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) teach the pair a lot about what really matters in life. If that sounds touchy-feely we should mention that all of the above is accompanied by acts of sudden and pointless violence heavy metal music and much talk of womens breasts. As for the profanity everyone in this film seems to use the F-word as a conjunction including elementary school-age Ronnie. This movie isnt quite as ribald as ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" but its a matter of degrees. Scott and Rudd are from two different moviemaking cliques but they get along fine in a Bing Crosby/David Bowie kind of way. Elizabeth Banks as Dannys girlfriend remains a welcome presence even as she attempts to co-star in every comedy released in 2008. But some of the strongest comic performances are in the smaller roles including the underrated Jane Lynch as the founder of Sturdy Wings who likes to talk a little too much about her past as a drug whore. And child actor Thompson is as funny as he appears to be in the trailers with an added vulnerable side that gives the movie a welcome change of pace. Director David Wain who co-wrote the screenplay with Rudd and two others piles on the gags without much focus in the beginning then later requires the audience to take these outrageous characters seriously. But once that rough transition passes the last 15 minutes of ""Role Models"" are original entertaining and ultimately triumphant. Its hard to remember a recent comedy that piled one memorable moment after another near the ending as this one does. Its best to give away as little about this big finish as possible so lets just say it combines the best parts of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Braveheart."" To paraphrase a fictional great man They may take our lives but they will never take our boob jokes. -- Advisory This film contains crude language sexual content and Renaissance faire violence (the weapons are made of foam but the blows are no less savage).

Role Models. (R) Universal (99 min.) Directed by David Wain. With Paul Rudd Seann William Scott Elizabeth Banks. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS The big juvenile jerk who refuses to grow up -- and then for the love of a good woman finally does. Its a time-honored comedy plot and if it didnt exist we wouldnt have had most of the raunchy comedies of the last decade -- and all of the Judd Apatow Comedy Factory output. But ""Role Models"" has a huge advantage over recent hit-and-misfires like ""Pineapple Express"" ""Step Brothers"" and ""Drillbit Taylor."" And what sets it apart is both baby-simple and nearly indefinable. But -- basically -- its . The movie revolves around two longtime if slightly improbable friends -- Paul Rudd who plays a middle-management drone seething with self-contempt and Seann William Scott as his party-hearty bud. They work for a Red Bull-ish energy drink company and spend their days pitching their noxious product at high school assemblies. But then Rudd -- hoping to break out of his rut -- impulsively proposes marriage to longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Banks and gets shot down. And spinning out of control he quickly commits a series of stupid misdemeanors that leave him and unwilling cohort Scott looking at a month of jail time. Unless they do 150 hours of community service mentoring a couple of kids. Theyre pretty unlikely role models which is where the comedy kicks in. Rudd for example finds joy in nothing -- a stance which doesnt seem likely to draw his geeky teen assignment out of his shell. And Scott finds joy in everything particularly women -- an approach a little too in tune with his hormonally raging 10-year-old charge. Its silly stuff but director David Wain -- a sketch comic himself -- clearly loves good actors and he gets fun performances from his cast. Scott for example -- not much of a presence in other films -- gets some great deadpan material. And Jane Lynch always tremendous -- she was the dog trainer in ""Best of Show"" -- kills as the slightly unhinged director of the not-for-profit that signs them up. Elizabeth Banks -- in her third comedy of the last few weeks if you count ""W."" -- typically doesnt get too much to do as Rudds girlfriend. But Passaics Rudd who is an excellent actor to begin with (hes also done straight dramas like ""The Shape of Things"" and ""The Cider House Rules"") is terrific in a rare strong lead as the misanthrope who begins to wonder what hes been missing. Some of the film -- mostly its traditional emotional ""moments"" -- feels a little forced. Although its a necessity in movies like this that the main character learns something on his journey its hard to say exactly why -- or how -- Rudds changed. Hes finally aware it seems that there are other people in the world -- but isnt this pretty much the minimal definition of adulthood? And Scott seems no different at the end than before. Yet Lynchs scenes as the chipper 12-stepping counselor -- who always seems a little too eager to talk about her days before sobriety -- are pretty hilarious. Appearances by Christopher Mintz-Plasse from ""Superbad"" and Ken Marino from ""The State"" fill out the cast nicely. And theres a whole wonderfully loopy subplot featuring costume-sporting role-playing medievalists thats just wonderful. ""Role Models"" is sometimes sloppy sometimes silly (and often quite happily unapologetically raunchy). But its also often thankfully funny. And thats an example a lot of wont-grow-up comedies would be wise to follow. Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations drug use and strong language.

Its just that I kind of have this soft spot for . . . misanthropes. Nothing quite sweetens my day like a little dose of bitterness. In ""Role Models"" Paul Rudd plays a guy who hates himself his job baristas and maybe his best friend (the underrated Seann William Scott). The two of them drive around to schools pitching auditoriums full of bored kids the idea that they should avoid drugs - and instead chug a highly addictive energy drink that is not at all like Red Bull. (Its green and its mascot is a minotaur which is only half bull.) ""Were selling nuclear horse piss for six bucks a can"" about sums it up. Worse Danny (Rudd who co-wrote the script with several others) has just hit his 10th anniversary on this job he starts fights with people who say ""ASAP"" and his girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks who is also in every other movie being released this fall) dumps him. Wheeler (Scott) boils down Dannys personality to this ""I hate myself yet Im better than everyone."" Sounds like a cool guy. In addition to being in a rut thanks to a traffic altercation hes also going to be in jail - unless he does community service mentoring little kids. Enter McLovin. Christopher Mintz-Plasse of ""Superbad"" plays Dannys little bro Augie Farks a geek who spends his leisure hours obsessing over a role-playing swords-and-sorcery game that amounts to a medieval faire come to life. Wheeler also has to participate in the same program and is assigned to Ronnie a foul-mouthed little black kid (Bobbe J. Thompson) who immediately accuses Wheeler of grabbing ""my joint."" ""Im not really into the whole buddy-buddy lets go do stuff together sort of thing"" Danny says. So naturally theres a camping trip and a medieval ""battle royale"" in which Danny is forced to learn how to work it 14th-century style with tunics and broadswords and kneeling like a vassal before the king and ""Bid him good morrow"" Danny takes the medieval name ""Lunesta."" Meanwhile Wheeler teaches Ronnie an essential lesson about what we can all learn from KISS. Later well be treated to the second-best movie scene ever built around the KISS ballad ""Beth"" (the one in ""Beautiful Girls"" remains unsurpassed). Despite its R rating ""Role Models"" is basically a kids comedy for adults; Danny and Wheeler are just big goofy eighth-graders who drive a monster truck ogle girls make jokes get called on the carpet by the principal-like weirdo (Jane Lynch) who runs the mentoring program and get upbraided by the mom-like Banks character. The movie biz once recognized that nobody spews profanity like grade-schoolers and in the 1970s movies like ""The Bad News Bears"" were rated PG a category currently reserved for movies like ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" through which no adult should have to sit without unlimited access to intoxicating beverages. ""Role Models"" isnt a classic like ""Superbad"" or as hilarious as this summers ""Step Brothers"" but its excellent fun for males in the mental age bracket of 14 to 22 which is most males. It may alarm you to learn that despite the raunch the gay jokes and the scene in which Wheeler advises little Ronnie how to use peripheral vision to check out the worlds supply of ""boobies"" there might be some sort of message coming but ""Role Models"" goes easy on the hugging and learning matrix. You stand a fair chance of emerging from the movie with your lack of faith in humanity unchallenged. ROLE MODELS Superbros. Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (profanity nudity drug reference). At the Lincoln Square the 34th Street the Orpheum others.

It stars Paul Rudd a veteran of The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up alongside Seann William Scott who isnt but should have been. It features Christopher Mintz-Plasse Superbads spurious Hawaiian organ donor as well as lots and lots (and lots) of booty-obsessive slacker humor that eventually gives way to warm life lessons and a late-onset but utterly sincere emotional maturation. The only thing missing from this Apatowannabe is Seth Rogen now found wearing short-shorts in Zack and Miri Make a Porno. Which come to think of it might have been Apatows too It hails from the squishy heart and potty mouth of Kevin Smith who was Judd Apatow before Judd Apatow. And it co-stars Elizabeth Banks Rudds conflicted love interest in Role Models. Then again Role Models actually generates laughter. It hits the proverbial funny bone -- to name a safely G-rated body part -- with welcome force and regularity despite a few stock gimmicks and multiple screenwriters. It was directed by David Wain (from whence came the biblical strangeness of The Ten) and co-written by Wain Rudd Timothy Dowling and repeat Wain collaborator Ken Marino who also pops up onscreen in a small role as a boob stepfather. The premise is straightforward enough. Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) are a coupla schmucks who hawk Minotaur energy drink (Wheeler calls it ""nuclear horse"" wee) to school kids at anti-drug assemblies. On one particularly awful day Danny gets rejected by his girfriend and decompresses by quaffing can after can of Minotaur then crashing the enormously horned company pickup into an equestrian statue. As punishment he and Wheeler are told to choose between jail time and 150 hours of community service at Sturdy Wings a Big Brother-y program run by a live wire (the sublimely twitchy Jane Lynch) in recovery from everything. She assigns Wheeler to Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) a squirt with a bloodcurdling vocabulary. Hes a riot. As one of those smut-conversant moppets so often found in comedies these days hes also just about unquotable -- aside from ""If youre white then youre Ben Affleck"" one of the years best false inductions. Danny meanwhile gets assigned to Augie (Mintz-Plasse) a caped dweeb who comes to life in live-action fantasy role-playing punctuated by Alacks Alays and thwacking Styrofoam swordplay. Augie pineth for a fair maiden and while hes never actually spoken with her he has ""killed her a couple times in battle."" Wain and his convocation of screenwriters play up the subcultural wackiness (I loved Ken Jeong as a vainglorious monarch in a plastic crown) but they show nothing but kindness toward Augie. They dont mock Augie for being a part of it. If Role Models is out to humiliate anyone its Danny and Wheeler Danny for being a joyless and pinch-faced contrarian; Wheeler for his randiness recklessness and platitudinous chitchat. ""When one door closes another opens"" he says At last a lech happy to paraphrase Reverend Mother in The Sound of Music. The film tosses around KISS homages (Wheelers) and deadpan repartee (Dannys) with the same coarse verve lending additional time to close-in reaction shots that give the humor extra kick. None of its all that groundbreaking. No boundaries get pushed not even the once-sacred barrier between four-letter words and peppy moralizing Apatow helped bomb that one to rubble. Role Models crosses plenty of familiar territory but Wain and his merry band of mischief-makers offer a likeable laughable mix of testosterone and heart. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals PUMA at eBay for Deals from 2 + free shipping 10x30-Foot Gazebo Tent Canopy for 75 + free shipping Sinwood Indoor Electric UV Insect Zapper for 29 + free shipping Original Penguin Mens Leather Wallet for 15 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Filth and sentimentality -- the yin- yang combo of current guy comedy -- entwine in ""Role Models"" with the naughty bits overpowering the funny. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott play Danny and Wheeler two energy-drink salesmen ordered to do community service as mentors or go to jail. Before his bad day got worse Danny was already becoming a drag on girlfriend Beth played gamely by Elizabeth Banks (""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"") who has become something of the ""it"" girl of this subgenre of comedy. Danny is the sort of crank customer who harasses baristas about the word ""venti."" Directed by David Wain ""Role Models"" is one of those coming-of- age tales in which the protagonists are old enough to know better but dont -- yet. Theyre ill-prepared to be the go-to guys of the title. Enter Ronnie and Augie two kids in need of Big Brothers. Newcomer Bobbe J. Thompson is Ronnie a black child with a jailhouse vocabulary that makes even randy Wheeler blush. The filmmakers insistence on the kids unrelenting bad-itude is the chief reason for the movies R rating. Its also turns into a lazy movie-long gag. Last year Christopher Mintz- Plasse delivered an indelible character in Fogell the nerd who rechristened himself McLovin in ""Superbad."" Here the actor with the permanent stuffy nose plays 16-year-old Augie. Dannys shy-guy ward comes into his own only when hes involved in a medieval role-playing game that has participants dressed up in fiefdom couture making alliances and slaying one another in battlefield contests. His mom worries that hes a freak. As does Danny. And the movie teases nicely everyones smug superiority to the dedication of these weekend warriors. Jane Lynch (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") is winning as the ex-coke fiend and ex-felon who runs the Sturdy Wings mentor program and has Dannys and Wheelers numbers.

Comments Role Models Recommended Sarcastic Paul Rudd and vulgar Seann William Scott run afoul of the law get sentenced to 150 hours of community service and wind up mentoring younger variations on themselves for Rudd a nerdy teen whos involved in live-action medieval role-playing (the bespectacled Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad) and for Scott a gloriously rude black kid who shares his obsession with boobs (Bobbe J. Thompson). This superior comedy features some of the same faces as Judd Apatows movies (Ken Jeong a hysterically funny Jane Lynch) but writer-director David Wain a veteran of the cable sketch series Stella and The State steers clear of any coming-of-age emotionality. The general tone is one of crusty unapologetic misanthropy driven home by the formidable Rudd (who also kicked in on the script). With Elizabeth Banks. R 99 min. By J.R.

Thompsons Ronnie in this scruffy buddy comedy. (SAM URDANK) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / November 7 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Role Models"" might just be this years ""Bad Santa."" Not because its foul-mouthed and foul-minded in ways calculated to appall all right-thinking moviegoers although its certainly that. Any movie that shows its heroes firing up a joint between stints as high-school anti-drug crusaders is true to its black little heart.No David Wains scruffy anti-everything comedy about two grown-up losers mentoring two young losers in a Big Brothers program is remarkable for the way it mines the comedy of defeated expectations. One of the leads Paul Rudds Danny Donahue has been selling nuclear-colored caffeine beverages to school kids for a decade and has just about lost the will to live His McJob has metastasized into a McLife. His partner a grinning goofball named Wheeler (Seann William Scott) actually likes dressing up in a Minotaur costume and bellowing ""Taste the Beast"" Together theyre the Mutt and Jeff of recession America.After Danny is dumped by his lawyer girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks) he drives his Minotaur-mobile up a statue which results in an arrest and court-mandated community service for himself and Wheeler. Theyre assigned to ""Sturdy Wings"" a mentoring program overseen by a grizzled yet impossibly peppy 12-step survivor named Gayle Sweeney (Jane Lynch from ""Best in Show"" and ""Talladega Nights""). Describing herself in an introductory video Gayle explains ""My father was a traveling salesman; my mother out of necessity was a whore.""Wheelers mentee is Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) an 11-year-old with the vocabulary and hormones of a sailor looking forward to shore leave after two years at sea. Danny gets Augie Farks a sullen nerd whose life revolves around LAIRE a fantasy role-playing game whose members meet in the park and hit each other with Styrofoam swords while speaking in potted medievalese. Augies played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse from ""Superbad"" - the characters basically that movies McLovin with fewer social graces.The film lets these four shambolically collide with each other learning twisted life lessons while the supporting characters avert their eyes in distress. Its not funny in a conventional punch line-and-response way but you find yourself laughing anyway The attitude of prostrate comic disgust is contagious.""Role Models"" works because Wain and Rudd (who collaborated on the script) have the same bed-head sense of humor. They dont work for a gag so much as sidle up to it kick the tires then snort in disbelief. (Scott is just along for the ride grinning that Cheshire Cat grin that implies hes either smarter than anyone here or much much stupider.) That the movies oddly endearing climax combines fantasy role-play and a deep abiding love of the music of KISS is just icing on a spiked cake.Wains filmography has been rocky (he made the sly teen-comedy parody ""Wet Hot American Summer"" as well as the horribly unfunny ""The Ten"") but he knows enough to trust his stars. Rudd in particular is becoming something unusual in American movies A leading man who appears to truly not give a damn.Hes handsome and obviously smart; he could have had Ben Afflecks career if hed tried a little harder or maybe Tobey Maguires. But theres something proudly lazy in Rudd; those bleak green eyes hold contempt for the whole business of stardom. ""Role Models"" plays well within the Judd Apatow playpen but its shaggy-dog dyspepsia renders it both less commercial and a little more dangerous and Rudd is why. Hes W.C. Fields trapped in the body of Cary Grant.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Thompson) in Role Models. ABOUT THE MOVIERole Models   (out of four)Stars Paul Rudd Seann William Scott Christopher Mintz-Plasse Jane Lynch Elizabeth BanksDirector David WainDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for crude and sexual content strong language and nudityRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Misfits and misanthropes are the heroes of Role Models a surprisingly clever comedy. A pair of overgrown adolescents (Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd) indulge in bad behavior and are assigned to mentor troubled kids in a Big Brother-type program. It sounds predictable. But it is consistently funny largely because of the sharp dialogue -- written by Rudd and director David Wain -- and a well-chosen ensemble cast. INTERVIEW Christopher Mintz-Plasse isnt like the nerds he plays VIDEO Check out a clip from Role Models Danny (Rudd) is a smart guy who doesnt suffer fools and works with Wheeler (Scott) as the spokesman for an energy drink company. A chain of events after a party to celebrate Dannys 10 years with the company nearly lands him and Wheeler in jail. Instead they are sentenced to 150 hours of community service in a program run by Gayle (a hilarious Jane Lynch) who assigns Danny to mentor Augie Farks an awkward adolescent fascinated by fantasy. Augie is played by the scene-stealing Christopher Mintz-Plasse who nearly stole Superbad as dweeby McLovin. Over time Danny develops an affection and respect for the boy in contrast to Augies parents who mock his interest in a Dungeons and Dragons-type competition. Mintz-Plasse takes what could have been a stock nerd and imbues Augie with intelligence and sweetness. Wheeler is assigned to mentor one of the toughest nuts to crack Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson). His youthful charge is not impressed with Wheeler until the older guy offers guidance on how to be a successful Lothario. Though Wheelers tips sometimes fall flat other gags offer plenty of laughs. Even familiar climactic scenes dont detract from the anarchic spirit. And though its rated R scatological humor is kept to a minimum. Role Models is a rare mainstream buddy comedy that deftly blends the endearing and the vulgar and intersperses raucous humor with subtle wit.

(Sam Urdank) Joe Neumaier Thursday November 6 2008 127 PM Where on the evolutionary scale of wacky-dudes-learn-to-grow-up movies does ""Role Models"" fall? Certainly less evolved than ""Meatballs"" but head and hairy knuckles above ""Daddy Day Care"" or ""The Benchwarmers"" in which Rob Schneider was loosed upon youngsters. But lets not give ""Role Models"" too much credit. Like its main characters the wild man-child Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and the frazzled grump Danny (Paul Rudd) the movie is simply stuck on stupid. In fact the whole movie is like a witless Mad Lib. Put the plot point in the brackets  Two direction-less guys working as [power-drink salesman] screw up their job by [talking up drugs to high schoolers]. Rather than 30 days in jail they get sentenced to [a kid-mentoring program] where they mess up big-time before they have to grow up fast.The twist with ""Role Models"" is that Dannys teenage charge (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is a styrofoam sword-brandishing geek in a Dungeons amp; Dragons-like role-playing a game called Laire. And if you cant imagine that Danny Wheeler and Wheelers foul-mouthed kid (Bobbe J. Thompson) wind up running around a fake castle trying to capture a chain mail-wearing king then you havent seen a movie since the original ""Bad News Bears."" Rudd who wrote the screenplay with director David Wain and seems not to have aged since 1995s ""Clueless"" is embracing his inner goofball here the way he did - more successfully - in writer-director Judd Apatows traveling circus. And to be fair any level of laid-back charm here is thanks to Rudd. But his familiarity with this kind of emotionally stunted character feels so overdone by now that even when Dannys girlfriend (the omnipresent Elizabeth Banks) breaks up with him Rudd appears to be texting it in. Scott is no better though here he adds some ugly chin hair so this randy buddy is different from the others he has played. Thompson is simply a profane pint-sized punch line and Mintz-Plasse who was droll in ""Superbad"" is dull here - although he does have a line that pretty much accounts for the one-star review in which he complains that people say he looks like ""a young Marvin Hamlisch."" However that line comes amid a long long scene in which the heroes enter the Laire game dressed as KISS. And yes someone croons ""Beth"" to Banks. Take a wild guess what her name is.

"Role Models | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; role-models ) Role Models (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Role Models takes a familiar PG-rated plot and adds enough profanity and nudity to earn it a family unfriendly R. Sadly an injection of raunchiness does not equate to an increase in quality and while Role Models can boast the occasionally funny joke theres little else to recommend this derivative buddy film. In fact the storyline is so obvious that it needs a heavy dose of hilarity to save it from bouts of tedium and director David Wains hit-or-miss comedy lacks the consistency necessary to make Role Models appealing. This is yet another film in which adults bond with kids and in the process both members of the pair learn important life lessons. The cold cynical adults come to understand the importance of unconditional love while the kids learn that all adults arent jerks. Of course the four leads (two kids two adults) are afflicted with a readily identifiable easily satirized character traits. Wheeler (Seann William Scott) is in a state of arrested development. Danny (Paul Rudd) has become cold and emotionally unavailable. Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is a LARP (Live Action Role Playing) addict. And Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) is as fond of dropping f-bombs as he is of staring at womens breasts. From a personality standpoint thats pretty much all you need to know about the characters because those are the only qualities the filmmakers care about. Wheeler and Danny are representatives for a company that manufactures a high energy drink. They travel from school to school promoting the drink as a ""healthy"" alternative to drug use. One day as a result of a series of painfully contrived circumstances the two find themselves on the wrong side of the law. To avoid a jail term they agree to 150 hours of community service (each) acting as big brothers to troubled kids. Danny is assigned Augie and Wheeler ends up with Ronnie. Predictably things start out rocky but as events foster mutual understanding relationships grow. There isnt a single moment in Role Models that hasnt been done often better in other similar films. The storyline has the feel of something constructed from a plot-by-numbers grab bag. The aspect of Role Models that keeps it from landing in the ""unwatchable"" bin is that some of the humor is genuinely funny. Wains take on LARPing (which is essentially a live-action version of Damp;D with padded swords and no dice) is amusing and avoids the trap of being too condescending to those productive members of society who participate in this activity. (Its a niche community but a surprisingly thriving one.) Many of the LARP jokes are amusing but not nasty. As for Ronnies R-rated dialogue - this is the kind of thing thats funny once or twice then loses its effectiveness once the shock value wears off. Then theres Jane Lynch whose zany portrayal of Gayle Sweeny Wheeler and Dannys community service boss is demented enough to cause plenty of chuckles. Lynch appears to be reprising her role from The 40-Year-Old Virgin which is okay. She was funny in that film and shes funny here. Unfortunately not all of Role Models humor works. Much of it is obvious and a lot of the jokes simply arent funny. The film appears to be trying for the R-rated John Hughes vibe that a number of recent Judd Apatow productions have tapped into but it misses the mark by a considerable distance. Speaking of Apatow its almost surprising not to see his name in the credits considering how many of his frequent collaborators are involved. In addition to the aforementioned Lynch Role Models co-stars Paul Rudd (who was also involved in polishing the screenplay) and features Elizabeth Banks as Rudds love interest. Also in the cast is Christopher Mintz-Plasse who mugs for the camera considerably less here than he did as McLovin in Superbad. Seann William Scott is perfectly at home with this sort of material. In fact hes pretty much playing an older but not appreciably more mature version of Stiffler from American Pie. Like far too many movies that bill themselves as comedies I didnt find Role Models consistently funny or engaging. Its disposable entertainment at its most extreme. One of the things I appreciate about Judd Apatow is something thats missing here. Apatow takes cookie-cutter stories like this and gives the humor and situations enough of an edge that they work. That doesnt happen in Role Models. For a movie to succeed with a premise this feeble the comedy needs to be more inspired than what Wain and his co-writers have scripted. This production falls into the category of the stale generic R-rated adult/kid bonding comedy. Only those with an affinity for such things will find Role Models tolerable.

Here it is pretty evenly split between the two camps though stupid may have a slight edge. Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott play pals stuck in dead-end jobs hawking energy drinks to elementary-school students. The gags are predictable The two offer anti-drug messages while smoking weed in their free time. After a car pileup they are sentenced to perform 150 hours of community service as a way to avoid jail. They arrive at Sturdy Wings a Big Brothers-style organization. One of the guys is paired with a misfit teen who enjoys role-playing games (Christopher Mintz-Plasse McLovin from the much better Superbad); the other gets a streetwise foul-mouthed youngster (Bobbe J. Thompson). Anyone who saw Drillbit Taylor knows which way the story is heading. The guys will learn about responsibility and the kids will inch closer to maturity. If there is a guidebook on how to pen a sentimental raunchy comedy the screenwriters must have memorized every page. It usually feels that rote. However as soon as youre ready to write Role Models off something clever momentarily livens things up. Most noteworthy is a bit that will bring a smile to anyone who ever was a fan of the rock band Kiss. The cast is good enough to make the material appear sharper than it is. Rudd and Scott are solid and Jane Lynch (Best In Show) pretty much steals every scene as the female Sherman tank who heads Sturdy Wings. Still one wishes there was a bit more creativity involved Shouldnt there be a moratorium on movies in which every Black person who appears is full of sass and wisecracks?

"Movie review Role Models -- 2 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Role Models -- 2 out of 5 stars Paul Rudd and Seann William Scott are Danny and Wheeler two salesmen who trash a company truck. Upon their arrest the court gives them a choice do hard time or spend 150 service hours with a mentorship program. After one day with the kids however jail doesnt look half bad. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Role Models is a scruffy hit or miss comedy in the modern rude-boy style. An R-rated romp with drugs naked women kids cussing and a sentimental streak its surprising that its not a Judd Apatow outing. But since it was conceived by and stars Paul Rudd part of Apatows inner circle it might as well be.Rudd and Seann William Scott star as two guys who peddle Minotaur energy drink to schools all over Southern California. They show up hopped up on Minotaur but under the guise of ""Minotaur says stay off drugs"" and then sell ""poison to our nations youth."" Thats the way Danny (Rudd) looks at it anyway. Wheeler (Scott) is a big happy strapping goof who uses his time in the Minotaur suit to hit on the teachers and anything else with a skirt.Danny snaps on one school visit; they get arrested and are sentenced to community service. The judge sends them to Sturdy Wings a ""Big Brothers"" style mentoring program where they have to put in 150 hours each with boys who you guessed it -- need Role Models. Rudd does his dry wry shtick making obvious wisecracks at the pretentious coffee bar playing Danny as a guy so sour on life that hes chased off the hot-lawyer girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks.. .. ..again). Scott does another variation on his Stifler doofus from American Pie. But when Jane Lynch another Apatow vet shows up as the no-nonsense nutjob who runs Sturdy Wings Role Models takes flight. Gayle Sweeney is the worst kind of do-gooder the recovering addict do-gooder.""I used to eat cocaine for breakfast"" Gayle growls. She flirts she insults she makes threats. Every line is a laugh every face she makes a giggle.Gayle hooks the two losers up with Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad) and Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson). Two self-absorbed alleged grown-ups with no direction and no interest in kids have to interact with boys who could use a little mentoring.Augie wears a cape. Hes so deep into the medieval sword and sorcery L.A.I.R.E. role-playing game that he almost never breaks character. Hes a nerds nerd. When hes not saying ""my liege"" and practicing his fake sword-fighting hes video gaming. Ronnie is a 10-year-old jerk ready to play the race card too ready to play the molested child quick with an insult. Danny is "" Ben Affleck."" Why? ""Youre white."" He curses like rap star and lets Wheeler know ""I aint your pal Vanilla Ice.""Danny half-heartedly joins Augies fantasy world (L.A.I.R.E. battles with legions of fellow-travelers) while wishing he could cure him of this life of unreality. Wheeler tries to turn Ronnie on to the pleasures of KISS.The role-playing war games are where the gold is mined here. The sappy boy-bonding stuff just reminds us that the big laughs arent big enough or plentiful enough to cover the many dead spots in Role Models.From this movies tone language intent and content its pretty obvious that Rudds role model is Apatow. But as funny as some bits are (KISS makeup is always good for a laugh) the best you can say about Role Models is that its imitation Apatow. It lacks the masters crude touch.

Each of them has to play big brother to a kid with major adjustment problems and if you hear that and think ""Isnt this a remake of some maximally dumb comedy from the 1980s?"" you?d be justified. The fun of Role Models is that its a high-concept movie executed with speed and finesse and the kind of brusquely tossed-off obscene banter that can get you laughing before you know what hit you. The fish-out-of-water setup may be claptrap but the movie feels loose shaggy and improv-y. Especially after Danny (Paul Rudd) a 35-year-old mope who sounds as if his soul has been burnt to a crisp and Wheeler (Seann William Scott) a skirt chaser without a single mean bone in his body arrive at the Sturdy Wings mentorship center and discover that trying to actually you know relate to a kid is their own special brand of hell. Wheeler is assigned to a pint-size pottymouth (Bobbe J. Thompson) as mentally agile as he is misbehaved while Danny gets stuck with Augie a myopic nasal teenage dork who devotes his afternoons to organized medieval role-play. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays this super-dweeb with such conviction that youre not sure if you want to laugh at him give him a pep talk or slap him silly. The director David Wain had devious fun putting bad youth movies through the wringer in Wet Hot American Summer and here he shows a corkscrew affection for the kind of studio comedy thats far too by-the-numbers to be mistaken for reality. What makes Role Models a kick is that its heroes act as if they cant quite believe their predicament is real either. Rudd delivers put-downs like a toxic avenger while Scott in his freshest star turn since American Pie uses his disarming sweetness to make Wheeler the most nuttily likable of sleazebags. Theyre matched by Jane Lynch who plays the Sturdy Wings overseer as an ex-addict who couldnt be prouder of those addictions; shes hooked on overdoses of ego. The big medieval battle of the cardboard swords with our heroes done up like the Knights of a certain rock band is an event the movie pays tribute to by seeing through every gloriously geeky minute of it.

Apatow MIA.Sam Urdank A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Paul Rudd wears the constant look of glazed-eye amusement; everything seems to tickle him even that which annoys or frustrates or disappoints him. Hes frat-boy handsome and therefore almost anonymous when he stands in a movie-star lineup; in Neil LaButes The Shape of Things (2003) Rudd received a supposedly extreme makeover and came out the other end looking unaltered. But Rudd is an effortless comedian--deadpan quick but not glib never eager to please--whose signature moves (a grimace a grin a tilt of the head and a muttered one-liner that always sounds improvised) have been honed to perfection during his collaborations with Judd Apatow who cast Rudd in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up and who audiences will likely think wrote produced and/or directed Rudds latest Role Models as well.But no Role Models is the brainchild of writers David Wain and Ken Marino both of the almost-deserving-of-its-cult-status comedy troupe The State and Rudd himself (who shares screenplay credit). Wain (who also directed and cameos) and Marino (who co-stars) were the first to recognize and utilize Rudds mannerisms when they cast That Guy From Clueless in 2001s Wet Hot American Summer a rather odd decision to parody Meatballs. Then last year Wain and Marino called on Rudds services again for the episodic hit-and-miss The Ten (in which he played an adulterous narrator) and Diggers Marinos soft-focus autobiography recast as a 1970s-set dramedy in which Rudd proved himself capable of going deep when need be.Their partnership has evolved nicely even profoundly if thats the right word for a movie in which a little kid says of Gene Simmons Paul Stanley Ace Frehley and Peter Criss ""I didnt know Jews could sing like that."" With Role Models the twitching ironic wink of WHAS that gave way to Diggers heart-sleeve sincerity has settled into a firm middle ground where Smart-Ass Laughs play off Sincere Moments of Affection. And the climactic showdown straight out of the recent documentary about the live-action role-playing game Darkon gives Role Models just the proper--nay sir heroic--amount of dork.In every way this is just another formulaic romp about two selfish slackers getting their priorities rearranged by a couple of kids--instead of breaking new ground it polishes it with sandpaper. As reps for an energy-drink company Rudd and Seann William Scott are going nowhere--except to the schools where they pitch their products buzz as an acceptable substitute for illegal drugs. Wheeler (Scott) loves the gig despite the Minotaur costume in which he does his five shows daily for smart-ass kids who wonder if he got the cow outfit at the gay zoo. Wheeler is the sad stunted Stifler if he grew up to become a soft-drink companys peddling Plushie.Then company suit and spokesman Danny (Rudd) chooses the occasion of his breakup with longtime girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks in what amounts to little more than an extended cameo) to sabotage their slacker gigs by running their monster truck up a schools statuary. For that crime of stupidity (among others) Wheeler and Danny are offered a choice go to jail for a month or mentor two boys in a Big Brothers-type organization called Sturdy Wings run by a rather unsteady former coke whore played by Jane Lynch. The Sturdy Wings logo makes for a rather subtle sight gag When splayed across a womans T-shirt the wings resemble hands wrapped around breasts. Indeed there is no shortage of booby humor here booby jokes booby-spotting advice and even boobies themselves. (Admit it ""Booby"" is one hilarious word.)Wheeler gets paired with 12-year-old Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) a self-proclaimed ""booby man"" who says ""fuck"" every time he exhales. The son of a single mother Ronnies less a brat than a brawler trying to fend off guys who choose fathering over jail time--some role models. And just when Ronnies mini-Eddie Murphy routine starts to grow stale hes reinvented yet again as a Kiss fan Danny meanwhile finds himself stuck with McLovin which is to say Augie played by Superbads Christopher Mintz-Plasse who last year starred in a phony public-service announcement in which he was warned of his pending doom as a typecast nebbish. Augie though is the geek who has no delusions of being cool; all he wants is to disappear into his medieval role-playing game where its perfectly acceptable to wear a cape and bow before a burger-joint king (played by Knocked Up gynecologist Ken Jeong).Of course the inevitable transpires Men whove behaved like boys begin acting their age and boys whove been left to fend for themselves stop acting out. Its been the plot of every other Adam Sandler movie--potty humor gets a hug. (Coincidentally or not the poster for Role Models in which Rudds pissing on a brick wall is almost identical to the one for Sandlers Big Daddy.) But Wain Marino and Rudd pull it off because theirs is a funnier brainier bawdier brand of feel-good . . . and because you can never go wrong with a climactic foam-padded sword fight set to Kiss.

After two comedies (""Wet Hot American Summer"" ""The Ten"") loaded with cult appeal that failed to dent the box office David Wain aims for the mainstream with ""Role Models."" Laden with more than enough profane humor to warrant its R rating this is nonetheless a formulaic crowd-pleaser whose outwardly crass soft-centered conceit would work as well for Adam Sandler or Eddie Murphy. All to the good however that its tailored to the equally impeccable comic chops of Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd. Steady laughs and upbeat word of mouth should make this a solid if unspectacular fall performer. Los Angelenos Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) work for energy-drink company Minotaur driving a novelty monster truck to schools where they -- Wheeler costumed as hairy ""Minotaur Man"" -- plug their legal-high product via facetious ""Just say no to drugs"" pieties. Its a no-brainer job that suits Wheeler fine leaving him free to obsess 24/7 over his only real interest which is getting laid. Danny however thinks hes wasting his life. Feeling a need for change he impulsively proposes to longtime girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks) but shes so fed up with his sourpuss attitude that she dumps him outright. An already horrible day ends in a tow-truck altercation that leaves the two boy-men facing 30 days in jail on various charges. Beth a lawyer manages to cut them a deal for 150 community service hours instead. Theyre handed over to Sturdy Wings a big-brother-type mentoring program run by Gayle Sweeney played by Jane Lynch as a one-woman Molotov cocktail equal parts perky stern and lunatic. Wheeler gets assigned Ronnie (Bobbe J. Thompson) a fatherless 10-year-old with a vile temper and filthier mouth. Sarcastic Danny gets Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse ""Superbad"") a consummate teenage dork with no friends outside the realm of his ultra-dweeby live-action medieval fantasy role-playing game. Needless to say these forced pairings do not start well though with equal predictability bonding does eventually occur -- if not always in the most age-appropriate ways. Theres also no great surprise to the adult blunders that nearly wreck these intergenerational relationships or to the big climactic setpiece in which the guilty parties make sacrifices that prove they care after all. But if the material has a formulaic feel and the dialogue often skews more rude than clever ""Role Models"" nonetheless amuses throughout. Thats in large part due to the stars whose roles very much play to their familiar comic strengths Scotts manic borderline-demented party animalism and Rudds ability to knock a line out of the ballpark with a deadpan bunt. Supporting turns kids included are also nicely done down the line. Lynch commits grand theft of scene after scene; Banks seen to fine advantage in concurrent ""W."" and ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" gets little to do as the sole character not allowed to be funny. Pacing is brisk and tech aspects are pro though in line with most recent comedies from the extended-Apatow-family camp pic seems allergic to the notion of even attempting visual stylishness.
