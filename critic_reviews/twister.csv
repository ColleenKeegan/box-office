More airborne bovines and fewer dramas starring Ricki Lake is my motto especially now that its May and weve been conditioned come warmer weather to want loud whammy thrill-packed big-budget productions that are long on special effects and short on dialogue written by Jane Austen. Remembering the rush of pure dumb pleasure provided by Speed two years ago and primed by the high-intensity trailers that have so effectively teased its release for months I couldnt wait to experience the Awesome Power of Nature as harnessed by Speed director Jan De Bont in Twister. Yet the images that linger longest in my memory are those of windswept livestock. And that in a teacup sums up everything thats right and wrong about this appealingly noisy but ultimately flyaway first blockbuster of summer. The fact is even if Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton are the human leads its the stuff that stars. The whirling animals houses and vehicles the eye-popping storm-chasing sequences and amoral Nature herself -- those are the headliners in this big-ticket disaster flick; and making us care about things rather than people is a challenge for a director even as action savvy as De Bont. In Twister -- which was written with all the delicacy of a Hollywood T. rex by Jurassic Parks Michael Crichton and his wife Anne-Marie Martin -- Hunt and Paxton play Jo and Bill Harding Oklahoma scientists and for romantic interests sake estranged husband and wife. The couple are united however in their obsession with a meteorological gizmo theyve invented called Dorothy. Dorothy is designed to release data-gathering sensors into the core of twister funnels in the pursuit of better tornado preparedness. But launching aint easy To succeed the Hardings and their equally gung-ho team of hootin hollerin young scientists (including Scent of a Womans spineless preppy Philip Hoffman and Speeds nervous passenger Alan Ruck) need to position themselves directly in the storms path. Which they do over and over again in a procession of scenes assembled evidently from the Big Book of Disaster-Movie Construction. (More tellingly this project executive-produced by Steven Spielberg looks back devotedly to Jaws as its structural bible.) The problem is even the most devastating twister in the whole wide world is in the end a random event. Thrillers demand some man-made conflict between good and evil. Yet against something so gigantic as these mothers of all cyclones the struggles of Twisters human protagonists feel puny. In a threadbare attempt to create some psychological drama the movie introduces Cary Elwes as a slick commercially funded storm chaser and former Dorothy team member who competes for publicity in a menacing-looking black van suggesting a Darth Vader helmet on wheels. (The natural sneer that livens up Elwes bland Princess Bride looks usually his best ally is overplayed here.) In a stab at manufacturing passion were supposed to understand that Jo (who in the form of game plucky Helen Hunt from NBCs Mad About You owns a limited but effective wardrobe of tight white undershirts) is mad about the heavens because of a lethal cyclone that swept her daddy into the sky when she was a girl. And were supposed to believe that her husband is obsessed because -- well with Paxtons wood-carved acting style (it worked fine in Apollo 13 now its just plain wood) we never do understand why. He just likes wind I guess. Except for Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys) shrieking nervously as a girlfriend obviously unsuited for life with a danger freak like Bill no one is afraid; everyone is up for the party. (Ive seen some shaky amateur tornado footage and the fear you hear on the audio is chilling.) Instead weve got us a soundtrack of wind whooshing music and a lot of yelling while maneuvering pickup trucks down country roads raining...cows. Gotta love the cows. Theyre unexpected. Theyre witty (at the very least as an homage to Monty Python and the Holy Grail). Theyre a tribute to the talents of special-effects supervisor John Frazier and his staff who also do a great job of flattening a town and making a hailstorm. But for summer-movie adrenaline junkies spoiled by Die Hards Lethal Weapons and Spielberg movies cool F/X are not enough. And for a movie that stars acts of God this work of mortals provides surprisingly little liftoff. The stuff that whips through the angry skies in Twister is the most exciting part of the spectacle. Essentially were turned on by debris.

Another theme park ride of a movie without an ounce of emotional credibility to it ""Twister"" succeeds on its own terms by taking the audience somewhere it has never been before into a tornados funnel. On this basis the first big summer release should live up to its intended status as an action blockbuster and set the worlds box office turnstiles swirling at enormous speeds even if audiences may not be sufficiently blown away to return for a second spin. Even more than with most of Michael Crichtons concoctions this one conveys the overwhelming impression of a mechanical entertainment a very high concept in which the characters and their problems seem like utterly arbitrary creations. The premise involving a bunch of ""storm chasers"" who hunt tornadoes as avidly as firefighters show up for blazes is perfectly valid but the personal dynamics are so simplistically and predictably drawn that from the out set even a child could forecast with assurance how the main characters will end up. Despite the spunky work of Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton the time between tornadoes is just dead air. Fortunately for thrill-seekers twisters in this picture are as common as crickets in the country so scarcely has one funnel cloud blown through than another one swoops down proving even more ferocious than the one before. The setup is straight out of an old Howard Hawks movie like ""Only Angels Have Wings"" A bunch of fun-loving daredevil professionals risk their lives virtually on a daily basis doing something most rational people would consider ridiculously dangerous. In this case the ragtag group headed by scientist Jo Harding (Hunt) is attempting to place sensors directly inside a funnel which would give the outfit unequaled status in the meteorological world. Unfortunately this is easier said than done since someone needs to place the sensors satellite-like container nicknamed ""Dorothy"" in honor of the picture with the most famous twister to date directly in harms way. Drawing upon Hawks a bit more Crichton and his co-scenarist Anne-Marie Martin set up a ""his Girl Friday"" situation with the arrival of Jos hard-driving almost-ex Bill (Paxton) who was the group leader before opting for the soft life as a broadcast weatherman. Bill turns up in the middle of the Oklahoma farmlands as bad weather is brewing to obtain his divorce papers so anxious is he to marry his princess fiancee Melissa (Jami Gertz in the Ralph Bellamy part). Bill gets a taste of the life hes left behind with the sudden arrival of the first twister and has his buttons pushed further when the competition in the guise of hotshot Dr. Jonas Miller (Cary Elwes) and his corporate-sponsored caravan of black vans roar onto the scene with their own sensors to launch. While Bill and Jo rediscover what its like to be together in the trenches remainder of the running time is taken up with the two crews racing around the countryside trying to intercept tornadoes of which there is a veritable plague -- or an abundance of riches depending upon how you look at it -- in order to be the first to launch their sensors. Films like ""Twister"" differ from their classical-era progenitors in two key ways In the older pics there was a little down time to get to know the characters and the cast was filled out with great character actors who made each part at least recognizable and often memorable. Other than the leads the characters here are incredibly annoying essentially interchangeable gonzo scientists whose main functions are to yell all their lines and keep moving in order to give the film a feeling of constant motion. None has any identity beyond wardrobe and hairstyle. Would it have been too tough to write a few interesting subsidiary roles? But clearly that is beside the point since ""Twister"" has it all over the films of yore in its special effects. In fact its doubtful that this film could have been made to similar impact even five years ago so much more proficient have such effects become. Director Jan De Bont and his ace effects team want to show off what they can do right from the start including astounding weather effects in the same widescreen frames as the characters with no telltale residue. The ante is upped with each tornado Cows fly by then a giant oil-tank truck comes in for a landing a drive-in showing ""The Shining"" is torn apart an entire barn goes up. Never is the situation just right for placing the sensors however until the end when once again the filmmakers deliver something brand new to the screen which will justify most peoples desire to see this whirlwind of action. Pic reps a lot of sound and fury to be sure and it never lets up even in the so-called quiet scenes which are generally filled with argumentative bickering and characters shouting to be heard over either the weather or one another. Never is there a calm moment or a shot that contemplates the awesome majesty and power of nature; in ""Twister"" spectacular weather is just a wild horse to be roped and ridden. Under the contrived circumstances Paxton and especially Hunt bring a great deal of vigor to their meant-for-each-other characters. Lois Smith is intended to have the meaty supporting part as Bills salt-of-the-earth aunt but the gangs pit stop at her home scarcely lets her get a word in edgewise. Gertzs fussy fiancee is never given a chance being the butt of fun from the get-go as she consults with therapy clients over her cell phone while Elwes sketches an equally one-dimensional opportunist. De Bonts direction is muscular but unnecessarily speedy rushing like a tornado through everything in his path while the effects set a new standard in their field. Jack N. Greens lensing on Oklahoma and Iowa locations is first-rate while Michael Kahns editing is if anything a bit over-strenuous like the picture itself. Some irritating heavy metal music at times pushes the soundtrack into overload.

The story can be described in two ways as a rip-off of Only Angels Have Wings in which Paxtons implausibly intuitive tornado expert is torn between two women his ex (Hunt) and his fiancee (Gertz) and two lives a safe weatherman job or a risky return to the group of crazily devoted storm-chasers trying to get a gizmo up inside a twisters suck-zone; or as a repetitive spectacle where all that happens is that the objects hurled around in the air simply get bigger. Forget the many redundant references to The Wizard of Oz this hasnt a fraction of that movies logic imagination or ambitions. Seriously depressing.

Starring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. Directed by Jan De Bont. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) From September to May its easy to forget just how much fun summer movies can be. ""Twister"" the first action blockbuster of 1996 is the reminder. Its now safe to go into the summer. This tornado thriller set in Oklahoma is a blast from its first scene when a farmer hiding with his family in the cellar is carried off clinging to the cellar door. Hes taken up like Sabu on a magic carpet -- except that hes upside down and screaming. Related Stories FILM REVIEW -- `Twister Packs a Big Punch / Predictable plot riveting action ""Twister"" offers that kind of nasty tingly thrill -- the pleasure of seeing tornadoes ripping up the earth collapsing houses and blowing down shopping centers. The fun of seeing everything made small. In one scene at a drive-in theater a tornado shreds a movie screen showing ""The Shining."" Theres Jack Nicholson breaking down a door with an ax -- and then hes gone. I cant explain why this is such a kick but it is. Sometimes the disaster is a fire sometimes an earthquake sometimes a shark. This time the chaos and madness of life on this planet takes the form of a tornado and it turns out to be great casting. Tornadoes are big dark handsome and they have a way of sucking up your attention. These twisters are the obsession of the storm chasers led by Bill and Jo Harding an estranged husband and wife played by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt. ""Twister"" takes place over the course of a single day in which the Hardings and their crew try to get a tornado to scoop up one of their tracking devices. The goal is to get inside one of those suckers to learn tornadoes patterns and better predict their movements. Its the perfect set-up involving characters like those in ""Death Wish"" and ""Jaws"" who do nothing but look for trouble and keep finding it. The blatant simplicity of this story may antagonize some. In the first minutes Bill shows up with his new fiancee (Jami Gertz) and asks Jo to sign the divorce papers. But wait A tornado is on the loose Off they go into the dark green yonder a caravan of trucks and happy-go-lucky American genius-adventurers whooping it up. ""Twister"" does what it needs to do. Within 10 minutes it makes sure that the audience does not want Bill or Jo or Melissa the fiancee to get carried off. Though the script is sometimes clunky husband-and-wife screenwriters Michael Crichton (""Jurassic Park"") and Ann-Marie Martin convey the cozy familiarity and inevitable squabbling of a husband-and-wife team. Hunt (of TVs ""Mad About You"") is not just likable and appealing; she actually manages to make something sexy out of Jos fearless fascination for tornadoes. Paxton does just as well as a fellow torn between conflicting impulses toward safety and adventure. But the real revelation is Gertz. Acting as a surrogate for the audience Gertz is the films tornado novice. Shes the comic character the one who gets scared and she handles the comedy skillfully. But she also carries the films biggest emotional moments as she realizes shes losing her guy. Special effects play a huge role in ""Twister"" and some might resent the reliance on computer graphics. Director Jan De Bont (""Speed"") was recently on a morning TV show running clips from the film and pointing out whats real and whats fake. Virtually everything in ""Twister"" is fake. But the effects in ""Twister"" are so expertly accomplished that it doesnt matter any more than it matters that the dinosaurs are fake in ""Jurassic Park."" It looks real and De Bont keeps the action coming so fast that theres no time to question it. At one point when a twister goes through a dairy farm there are cows floating through the air. In another scene Jo and Bill see something curious spinning out from a tornados center. ""What is that?"" they ask. Its an oil truck -- and its heading for them. Its hard to dislike a picture with flying cows and oil trucks.

"Twister | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; twister ) Twister (United States 1996) A movie review by James Berardinelli As movie-goers we expect different things from big-budget summer blockbusters than we do from ""normal"" films. Considerations of theme and character become secondary to action and mind- numbing excitement. The plot is expected to be very basic -- only complex enough to frame the spills and chills. Jurassic Park is a perfect example of this sort of thing as is last years Die Hard with a Vengeance. This years first entry is the eye-popping ear-blasting Twister Jan De Bonts violent weather follow-up to Speed. Twister which follows a team of tornado chasers as they track down storms is exciting if a little shallow. This particular disaster movie which pits man against an implacable unstoppable enemy owes as much to Godzilla and Jurassic Park as to The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. Its a perfect motion picture roller coaster -- fun fast and furious... as long as you dont think too hard. In real life violent weather can be both terrifying and exhilarating. Theres nothing quite like standing in the path of a monster storm even if it earns you the label of having a death wish (in fact its the possibility of death that gets the adrenaline pumping). Twister tries with limited success to capture that sensation. There are times when the tornado strikes seem a little too ""glamorized"" by the special effects gurus but in general these ILM-fashioned monsters generate enough awe to make us feel that were watching the ""finger of God."" In real life tornado chasing has a higher percentage of misses than sightings so the fact that every expedition in Twister unearths a powerful storm comes across as a too-obvious-to-miss plot contrivance. Not that we really care. De Bont keeps things moving and except for a few feeble character-building scenes our heroes are on the road speeding after or away from spinning devastation. Twister opens with a short prologue in June 1969. Its one of the films most effective sequences as a family of three flees into a shelter to escape an oncoming storm. The father is killed sucked into the vortex while his wife and five-year old daughter Jo watch. More than twenty-five years later that little girl has grown up to be a tornado chaser. Played by Helen Hunt Jo is obsessed with increasing the pre-storm warning time. Accompanied by her old partner and soon- to-be-ex-husband Bill Harding (Bill Paxton) her usual crew and Bills fiancee (Jami Gertz) Jo is about to try out ""Dorothy"" a specially-built instrument designed to spit out data from inside the vortex. So in the midst of ""the biggest series of storms in 12 years"" Jo and Bill hit the road vying with a rival scientist (Cary Elwes) to reach each new storm first. Apparently nature doesnt make a good enough villain so the writers of Twister decided to add some nasty human rivals. Unfortunately Cary Elwes character is both unnecessary and irritating; the tornadoes are enough. Equally superfluous are the romantic complications in the relationship between Jo and Bill. Its a rather boring subplot and if these two had been together from the beginning (they are married albeit almost divorced) we would have been spared the presence of Jami Gertz unappealing character. Author Michael Crichton not relying on one of his ultra-popular bestsellers dips into his bag of tricks to come up with a completely artificial plot. Without De Bonts energetic direction the seams in Crichtons script (which was co-written with his wife Anne-Marie Martin) would have been more apparent. Fortunately the films fast pace and stunning audio/visual elements camouflage the deficiencies. And it helps that both Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton while not ""major"" stars are likable and share a pleasant camaraderie. Theyre our guides through tornado territory and we need their stability with De Bont throwing everything at us -- including the kitchen. Twister is peppered with bits of information about how to react if a tornado approaches how dangerous the storms can be etc. Despite these snippets of safety-conscious advice the movie doesnt function as a public service announcement nor should it. Twister doesnt have any pretensions. It is what it sets out to be an effective piece of big money early summer entertainment designed to blow viewers away.

More airborne bovines and fewer dramas starring Ricki Lake is my motto especially now that its May and weve been conditioned come warmer weather to want loud whammy thrill-packed big-budget productions that are long on special effects and short on dialogue written by Jane Austen. Remembering the rush of pure dumb pleasure provided by Speed two years ago and primed by the high-intensity trailers that have so effectively teased its release for months I couldnt wait to experience the Awesome Power of Nature as harnessed by Speed director Jan De Bont in Twister. Yet the images that linger longest in my memory are those of windswept livestock. And that in a teacup sums up everything thats right and wrong about this appealingly noisy but ultimately flyaway first blockbuster of summer. The fact is even if Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton are the human leads its the stuff that stars. The whirling animals houses and vehicles the eye-popping storm-chasing sequences and amoral Nature herself -- those are the headliners in this big-ticket disaster flick; and making us care about things rather than people is a challenge for a director even as action savvy as De Bont. In Twister -- which was written with all the delicacy of a Hollywood T. rex by Jurassic Parks Michael Crichton and his wife Anne-Marie Martin -- Hunt and Paxton play Jo and Bill Harding Oklahoma scientists and for romantic interests sake estranged husband and wife. The couple are united however in their obsession with a meteorological gizmo theyve invented called Dorothy. Dorothy is designed to release data-gathering sensors into the core of twister funnels in the pursuit of better tornado preparedness. But launching aint easy To succeed the Hardings and their equally gung-ho team of hootin hollerin young scientists (including Scent of a Womans spineless preppy Philip Hoffman and Speeds nervous passenger Alan Ruck) need to position themselves directly in the storms path. Which they do over and over again in a procession of scenes assembled evidently from the Big Book of Disaster-Movie Construction. (More tellingly this project executive-produced by Steven Spielberg looks back devotedly to Jaws as its structural bible.) The problem is even the most devastating twister in the whole wide world is in the end a random event. Thrillers demand some man-made conflict between good and evil. Yet against something so gigantic as these mothers of all cyclones the struggles of Twisters human protagonists feel puny. In a threadbare attempt to create some psychological drama the movie introduces Cary Elwes as a slick commercially funded storm chaser and former Dorothy team member who competes for publicity in a menacing-looking black van suggesting a Darth Vader helmet on wheels. (The natural sneer that livens up Elwes bland Princess Bride looks usually his best ally is overplayed here.) In a stab at manufacturing passion were supposed to understand that Jo (who in the form of game plucky Helen Hunt from NBCs Mad About You owns a limited but effective wardrobe of tight white undershirts) is mad about the heavens because of a lethal cyclone that swept her daddy into the sky when she was a girl. And were supposed to believe that her husband is obsessed because -- well with Paxtons wood-carved acting style (it worked fine in Apollo 13 now its just plain wood) we never do understand why. He just likes wind I guess. Except for Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys) shrieking nervously as a girlfriend obviously unsuited for life with a danger freak like Bill no one is afraid; everyone is up for the party. (Ive seen some shaky amateur tornado footage and the fear you hear on the audio is chilling.) Instead weve got us a soundtrack of wind whooshing music and a lot of yelling while maneuvering pickup trucks down country roads raining...cows. Gotta love the cows. Theyre unexpected. Theyre witty (at the very least as an homage to Monty Python and the Holy Grail). Theyre a tribute to the talents of special-effects supervisor John Frazier and his staff who also do a great job of flattening a town and making a hailstorm. But for summer-movie adrenaline junkies spoiled by Die Hards Lethal Weapons and Spielberg movies cool F/X are not enough. And for a movie that stars acts of God this work of mortals provides surprisingly little liftoff. The stuff that whips through the angry skies in Twister is the most exciting part of the spectacle. Essentially were turned on by debris.
