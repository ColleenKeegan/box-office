"Review Book of Eli More Parable than Actioner - MTV mtv Menu mtv mtv Home Shows Full Episodes Shows A-Z TV Schedule App MTV2 2016 vmas Shows News Music from the Shows Casting Calls Music Music Artists A-Z Music Videos Artist to Watch News Latest News Music Celebrity TV Movies Style Politics Life TV Provider Signout facebook twitter tumblr news Shows Full Episodes Shows A-Z TV Schedule App MTV2 2016 vmas Shows News Music from the Shows Casting Calls Music Music Artists A-Z Music Videos Artist to Watch News Latest News Music Celebrity TV Movies Style Politics Life facebook twitter tumblr VMA Nominations Live From The DNC Music Movies Review Book of Eli More Parable than Actioner Laremy Legel 01/15/2010 Theres a theory which states that in times of war and famine it is the good people who die first. Youve probably heard The Piano Man sing about it but it basically follows that the sort of person able to survive times of great strife isnt also generally the sort of person with strong moral convictions. If youre not willing to lie cheat or steal ... then the topsy-turvy landscape of a life-shattering global event finishes you off. Im not sure if I personally subscribe to this theory but into this precipice walks Denzel Washingtons Eli; hes surrounded by post-apocalyptic baddies a ""good"" man on an arduous mission. Can he keep his essential Godliness while also tangling with the devil? These are the questions the Hughes brothers ask of their audience in Book of Eli; theyre also the questions I havent quite been able to reconcile with the other moments of gunplay contained within. Could it be that faith is making a beeline toward hip? There is no doubt that the power of love is a curious thing. And you dont have to listen to the news to know that it can make one man weep and another man sing. Eli (Denzel Washington) loves beyond all comprehension the book he carries across the remains of an ashen and dusty United States. He carries it with faith and fidelity; its both his burden and his blessing. But what of this world Eli inhabits? Something has happened something awful and now people are as scarce as they are scared. It seems as though the world went to war with itself or an asteroid hit or perhaps some other sort of natural disaster -- whatever the case civilization is utterly torched. Books? Theyre even harder to find than people and as a result literacy has taken a real dive. This is a world where people get murdered for their personal possessions a world where you have to barter prized possessions for essential items like water and food. And yet Eli walks. And walks. Hes a lonely traveler with only his book to keep him company. Well and Al Green naturally whose voice Denzel uses as a tool for escape early on in the movie. Youd have to assume that even a monumentally destructive force would leave us Al Greens ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart"" behind on an MP3 player. Or at least I like to hope she would. The Hughes brothers film feels more vibrant than the bleak Road which was launched at us in November. Here the brothers show us the horror but somehow the staid and calm Denzel feels more approachable than the distraught and scrambling Viggo. To give away what the book is or Gary Oldmans villainous role or really any more details at all would be a disservice to the reader. See it clean and without preconceptions. Its a simple tale (in execution) but perhaps more complex in terms of the overarching theme. I mean if it all came tumbling down what would you hold dear? The recent earthquake in Haiti slams it home Are we our brothers keeper? Can great evil ride upon the best of intentions? Perhaps Im reading too much into this and if you get very little out of it then you have my sincere apologies. Take it away Al Green (covering the Bee Gees) ""How can you mend this broken man? How can a loser ever win?"" The Hughes brothers might not have the answer there. But theyre sure as hell asking the questions with a lively vigor.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 15 2010 Save for later Saved This movie still released by Warner Bros. Pictures shows Denzel Washington (center) as Eli in Alcon Entertainments action adventure film ""The Book of Eli"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What is it about movies and the apocalypse these days? It cant all be blamed on post-9/11 syndrome. I was just recovering from ""The Road"" when along comes ""The Book of Eli"" starring Denzel Washington as a wanderer in the wasteland of a proverbial not-too-distant future. Its 30 years after what is doomily referred to as ""the last war"" and water is so scarce that people bathe with leftover wet wipes from KFC.Washingtons character is essentially nameless although if you stick it out long enough - or bother to recall the movies title - youll know him as Eli. He makes his way across the charred barren landscape with an impressive amount of fighting equipment strapped to his torso which when he undrapes looks heavily scarred. He listens to music at least I think he does with what looks like an iPod. Guess those things can survive even an end-of-world blowout. He also zealously guards his prize possession a heavy leatherbound tome that he calls ""the book"" although clearly its the Bible. This book or Book is also coveted by a sleazoid named Carnegie (Gary Oldman doing his smarmy specialty). Carnegie is a two-bit despot who has assembled a gaggle of gunmen and runs a makeshift town in the middle of nowhere. Like Eli Carnegie remembers the days before the war and this means he also remembers his Bible. But unlike Eli who is a man of peace (unless provoked) Carnegie spends his spare time charging the grovelly locals for water and poring over such tomes as ""The Da Vinci Code"" and a biography of Mussolini. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But the book he sends his minions far and wide to find is the Bible. He thinks that with it he can subjugate the world although there doesnt seem like a whole lot to subjugate. Its like appointing yourself king of an auto wrecking yard in the middle of the Sahara. But apparently no copy survives until Eli shows up with one and hes not willing to part with it. Anyone who tries to separate Eli from his book ends up separated from himself. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Book of Eli movie review Eli is the classic strong-silent Westerner a pacifist warrior. He doesnt go looking for fights; he does everything he can to avoid them but dont make the mistake of messing with him. If you do hell turn into a dervish of destruction. The codirectors twin brothers Allen and Albert Hughes are best known for such blunderbusses as ""Menace II Society"" and the Johnny Depp-starring Jack the Ripper shocker ""From Hell"" and here they appear to be extending their reach into the realms of kung fu. ""The Book of Eli"" which has a deliberately ugly bleached copper look is like a video-game mash-up of American and spaghetti westerns and Japanese samurai flicks.Its a mans world out there in postapocalypse land. The Hughes Brothers attempts to work in a female love interest - or to be more exact a female presence - seem perfunctory. Eli is the recipient of a tag-along cutie named Solara (Mila Kunis) although he doesnt seem at all interested. But he saves her from the obligatory roadside rape thereby endearing himself to her. Solara wears designer sunglasses - another artifact that has miraculously survived the final war. As a sort of messianic figure Eli is in heavy company these days not only the stragglers in ""The Road"" but also the US Marine-turned-Navi savior in ""Avatar."" Carnegie takes one look at Eli and says ""He is not like other men"" then spends the rest of the movie trying to co-opt or kill him to prove ""hes just a man."" Eli just wants to ""stay on the path"" plodding ever westward to the Golden Gate Bridge. (A good alternate title for this film would be ""Escape to Alcatraz."") Washington doesnt look as if hes having much fun and who can blame him? Perhaps he agrees with me Apocalypse movies like apocalypse heroes need some laughs too.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 14 2010 114PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Book of Eli Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes Written by Gary Whitta Starring Denzel Washington Gary Oldman Mila Kunis Classification PG Really its just another prophet-in-the-wilderness tale - not nearly as bad as those trailers would suggest yet neither will your soul run any risk of enlightenment. The wilderness in this case is awfully familiar. Once again the ashen landscape is postapocalyptic 31 years have passed since ""the Flash"" and the future aint looking bright. So were back on The Road  but this time Elis coming - better hide your heart and while youre at it put your brain on hold the easier to enjoy the action-filled sermon to come. Being an American prophet Eli (Denzel Washington) is heading west to keep the dream alive a lucky thing since most everything around him is dead or dying - skeletal cars with their skeleton drivers scant food scarce water the usual molten mess. Since the usual disembodied voice has spoken Eli carries with him the Word the last extant copy of the Good Book. Apparently all the other Bibles were burned since ""some people said the book was responsible for the war in the first place."" Yes the Word is only as good as its interpreters. But were in safe hands with Eli a true Christian among the cannibals. Onward then our Christian soldier marches neither looking for trouble nor running from it. However the script borrows trouble aplenty largely from those B-westerns it starts to imitate. Surrounded by outlaws the prophet/cowboy smites them with his trusty weapon. Then he wanders into the frightened town ruled by the corrupt despot (Gary Oldman) and his posse. More smiting - in the saloon on the dusty main drag at high noon. Outnumbered bucking the odds Eli seems indestructible. Is he is Denzel more than a mere man? As were pondering that metaphysical conundrum the pretty gal makes her appearance. Like all the young folks after the Flash Solara (Mila Kunis) is illiterate. Still upon hearing the 23rd Psalm shes knocked out by its prose stylings and soon is walking with the prophet through the valley of the shadow of death. Yea he comforts her even as evil gives chase. Meanwhile the directors - Allen and Albert Hughes - are striving to comfort us hoping to elevate this stuff to the status of myth. Unfortunately they mainly resort to name-calling Eli for starters; the despot is called Carnegie cause hes got a vast library of books; then an aging couple introduce themselves presidentially as George and Martha. Nice try but no sale. Besides theres only one Washington who counts here. Indeed the star imparts to this role more dignity than it deserves. And again hes up against ferocious odds. After Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction  the whole quoting-scripture-and-smiting routine is hard to rescue from its own vale of black humour and pop irony. So to keep this from descending into inadvertent camp Denzel has to do some very heavy lifting and give him credit. The actor may not redeem his character but he saves Eli from a fate worse than death - the mocking snickers of a non-believing audience. Nope I didnt snicker once (okay maybe a little at the end). I even found some enjoyment early on as always taking a perverse delight in the sheer ""survivorman"" pragmatics of these postapocalyptic yarns all that hunting and gathering and bartering. Here where water is precious personal hygiene is a major problem. So guess whats fetching a fat price on the free market? KFC handiwipes. Now theres a product placement that will have the old Colonel spinning in his southern grave - forget that damn chicken boys but stock up on them wipes.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Book of Eli"" is quite possibly the first Sunday-appropriate R-rated action flick. Starring Denzel Washington the film works for the multiplex masses as well as it might some church congregants. Directed by the Hughes brothers -- Albert and Allen -- the tale of a solitary traveler in possession of a coveted tome is unapologetically engaged with belief. The movie doesnt run from its Christian themes; it cant -- not with a character who embraces them so deeply. Yet its as likely to make Good Book-thumpers squirm in their pews as it is to rouse atheist point-guard Christopher Hitchens and team from the bench. Washington plays a character who walks the nations byways 30 years after a series of cataclysms has scorched the planet. The ruined ashen landscape littered with husks of cars and the occasional human remains evokes ""The Road."" That postapocalyptic fable which opened last Thanksgiving was concerned with the most personal of bonds those between parent (really father) and child (really son). Washingtons gun-toting machete-wielding figure is connected only to a book he carries in his rucksack. Hes an expert survivor so gifted with his weapons that hes almost a miraculous dismantler of foes. Though the film is rated R its slashing decapitating bullets-flying violence seems to happen at a remove. Like the hero the filmmakers dont want to celebrate the mayhem at least not entirely. The Hughes brothers have given audiences a graphic-novel flick but theres no comic-book series out there on which its based. They enlisted comic-book artists to help hone the look a mix of sharp duns and grays. And writer Gary Whitta who has done most of his work in videogames and comic books has crafted a script nearly as methodical and deliberate as its hero. The film unfolds with the patience of Job. Sure its familiar. Asked where hes headed Washingtons character (whose name were unsure of throughout much of the film) answers ""West."" But of course. ""The Book of Eli"" is a proto-Western with a hero driven by the most manifest destiny of all a sign a calling. The town that threatens to stop the Traveler is as prone to filth and brutality as Deadwood. Tom Waits provides fine spiky- haired pleasure as the keeper of a pawnshop. Gary Oldman is a brilliant choice to portray the cultured baddie Carnegie. When first we meet him hes the most refined thing on screen. Looking like an elegant vampire he is a reader hankering for a book. Not just any book we learn. He burns the copies that his henchmen have delivered. The one he seeks has a particular power. Like the Traveler Carnegie is old enough to remember a time before the wasteland a time of plenty a time for tales. The book he seeks is rumored to be the last one. Its ability to give focus to anxieties fears rages makes it a prize. Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis portray Claudia and Solara Carnegies common-law wife and adopted daughter. Its easy to read the two as a pair of Mary Magdalenes. In Carnegies cowardly new world women make Faustian bargains for their safety. Like most thugs cultured or otherwise Carnegie fluidly moves from solicitous to cruel. He treats Claudia (who is blind because well theres no shortage of symbolism here) kindly unless it doesnt suit him to. Solara is even more chattel. His second in command (Ray Stevenson who has a centurian moment straight out of ""The Robe"") covets Solara. Wide-eyed Kunis is appealing as the naif who insists on joining the Traveler. But its Washingtons austere portrayal that bears the movies weighty themes. The Hugheses arent out to break the mold. Theyre hanging their 10-gallon ambitions on proven entertainment hooks. An example of their clever rhythms? After the heaviest spiritual revelation the movie finally introduces us to the oft-mentioned cannibals (not exactly what youd expect) with flair and a really hilarious use of pop music -- and then powers into a hellacious action sequence. ""Avatar"" is a secular-spiritualist parable of what our future might become. As with that movie one thing seems certain No matter the technological advances or leveling cataclysms we humans drag our worst qualities with us. Our rank impulses so say the movies are like cockroaches indestructible. Thankfully our goodness endures too. So let the arguments begin about the religious messages woven into ""The Book of Eli."" In the meantime prepare for a stylish gritty fantasy feature that wrestles with the agonies joys and eternal wrinkles of faith and evil and the dangerous minuet they do.

Movie Information The Book of EliRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirectors Albert and Allen HughesActors Denzel Washington Gary Oldman Mila Kunis and Jennifer BealsRun time 118 minutesMPAA rating R (violence sexual situations language)Synopsis Denzel Washington (with kung fu action) is a man on a mission in this apocalyptic tale.More movies from GuideLive.comIn The Book of Eli similarities to post-apocalypse movies from The Road Warrior to most recently The Road abound the obliteration of civilized society hordes of cannibalistic scavengers the sheepish many terrorized by the violent few. It also borrows heavily from Westerns particularly the films of Sergio Leone with its cinematic sweep updating its lone-warrior hero to the man with one name.But what the Hughes brothers have really made is a 21st-century samurai film following the all-but-silent endlessly stoic Eli (Washington) on his quest to complete an urgent but elusive task.The world as we know it is gone replaced by the now familiar wasteland of ruined cities and freeways like half-buried skeletons where survivors hang on like rats scavenging a garbage dump. The Hughes brothers (co-directors Allen and Albert) cast this world in a spare palette of washed-out brown rust and amber. Everything looks dry dusty and dead.Something happened some time back. We never really know what - a hole in the sky a blinding event a war and now this. The movie takes its time. You watch Eli stride with purpose across this wasteland without knowing who he is or what his purpose is. When he walks into an ambush and without so much as a tremor of emotion slashes through a gang of thugs you learn that he is a serious man. A little later when he crouches out of sight and watches another gang kill a couple of less fortunate wanderers while holding himself back and repeating like a mantra ""stay on the path"" you learn that he is a serious man on a mission.The narrative pieces fall into place when Eli enters a ""town"" where he encounters Carnegie. As played by Gary Oldman Carnegie is an entrepreneurial despot. He knows where the water is so he has power over the locals. But if he can locate a Bible he will also control the Word. In some sort of Fahrenheit 451 scourge Bibles along with most books were destroyed way back when and now only a few elders even remember books or how to read. Eli wants to save the Bible so he can serve God. Carnegie wants to have the Bible so he can be God.Theres strong potential for an interesting myth to be played out here and there are occasional flashes of it. But mostly The Book of Eli is predictable and formulaic. By the time it reaches its conclusion its clear that neither the directors nor screenwriter Gary Whitta really had an inspiring or even sensible idea of where to go. Oldman is fun but his character never really develops; he just is and then he isnt. Mila Kunis is totally miscast and looks as if she wandered on-screen from whatever romantic comedy she was starring in.What strength and intensity the movie musters begins and ends with Washington; once again King Kong aint got nothing on him. The swish-swish bang-bang fight scenes are so fluidly shot and coolly choreographed you just wish the Hughes brothers had gone full-on samurai and had one every few minutes. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"The Book of Eli A lost opportunity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Book of Eli A lost opportunityHad The Book of Eli arrived exactly a year ago it might have been viewed as scorched satire on the swapping of White House occupants and their differing philosophies.Denzel Washington part of fine cast that gets lost in what could have been a biting satire on U.S. politics.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 15 2010  Starring Denzel Washington Gary Oldman and Mila Kunis. Directed by the Hughes Brothers. 117 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Had The Book of Eli arrived exactly a year ago it might have been viewed as scorched satire on the swapping of White House occupants and their differing philosophies.Article Continued BelowHere you have a charismatic and literate African-American (Denzel Washington) roaming a post-Apocalypse United States promising hope and change in a land ruled by thugs and stuttering morons.But the picture is a lost opportunity perhaps mirroring reality in that regard. This Book doesnt teach inspire or amuse; instead it mysteriously flops open at that well-thumbed page favoured by hack filmmakers the one that reads simply ""Smash hack and torch."" Its The Road Warrior meets The Road and a lot of brain cells burn along with the rubber.Did it have to be this way? The formidable acting skills of Washington and co-star Gary Oldman one playing the noble ""Democrat"" and the other the rapacious ""Republican"" combined with the directorial flair of onetime wunderkinds the Hughes Bros. could have made for quality entertainment and social commentary. Something along the lines of Menace II Society the brothers first and best film.Instead we get a derivative downbeat diversion drained of most colour as per the status quo which pales in comparison to superior recent films like Daybreakers The Road and Zombieland in showing us how humans cope (or dont) after the big whatever is dropped upon them.In this case its been 30 years since Armageddon and Washingtons Eli has been walking the ruined highways quoting Scripture and Johnny Cash and listening to a still-functioning iPod as he heads west on an unknown mission. Anybody who gets in his way gets a polite warning followed by a machete chop to errant body parts; its amazing how many dangerous bikers suddenly become armless.""Stay on the path"" is Elis mantra reminiscent of The Roads ""carrying the fire.""Eli is carrying a leather-bound book that is meant to be a head-slapping surprise but no rocket science is required for this reveal. The book is being sought by Oldmans Carnegie the despotic ruler of a Wild West town where cold water and hot hookers (played by Jennifer Beals and Mila Kunis) are still available.Carnegie aint no idiot even though he dresses like a Mad Max wannabe and he susses that theres something in Elis book that could turn the sun-scorched and huddling masses into his obedient servants.Why hes fussed about this is anybodys guess since he already rules the roost simply by shouting at his stooges. Its just one of many mysteries of a movie weighed down by a numbskull screenplay (by rookie Gary Whitta) and a careless lack of attention to details.This is the first film by the Hughes Bros. since their noble misfire with From Hell in 2001 (back when Johnny Depp wasnt really a star) and youd think they might have put more effort into making this scorched scenario just a trifle more believable.How is it that all the major characters wear designer sunglasses showing no signs of wear and flash blinding white pearlies that betray no malnutrition or lack of dental care? Why do the women still look really good especially the Apoca-licious Kunis in her designer rags?How can Eli have been walking for 30 years yet still not have reached his destination? Maybe this explains why he apparently takes a wrong turn and retraces his steps ending up dealing with a couple of the same varmints hed already dispatched.Theres some nifty bladework and a few decent chase sequences but what this picture cries out for is a sense of evil humour. The closest the film gets to that and it may be accidental is when one of Carnegies book-hunting stooges presents him with copies of The Da Vinci Code and Oprah magazine.""Burn em"" Carnegie scoffs.Everyones a critic even at the end of the world.

Denzel Washington cast as the cowboy-monk Eli is on a mission from God. He has to carry that Bible through a landscape populated by murderous illiterate cannibalistic roughnecks to a safe place he saw in a dream. Eli may not be Jesus exactly--the Christian Lord would never have been so deft with a machete--but he is in possession of some God-given magic. This protects him his puppyish girl companion (Mila Kunis) and the book during their long journey.An honorable prophet guarding the word of God for the future of humankind would seem an overblown premise for an action-buddy movie but Washington is more than cartoonish. The Book of Eli provokes us to imagine all our values turned upside down. ""We had more than we needed"" remembers Eli of the time before the war. ""We had no idea what was precious and what wasnt. We threw things away that people kill each other for now.""Audiences will doubtless react to the movies not-so-buried Christian message but the Bible isnt whats sacred here. Its books. For those of us in the reading and writing business--for anyone really who loves the written word--the movie has a powerful resonance. It reminds us that literacy cant be taken for granted. Allen and Albert Hughes who together directed the movie insist theyre spiritual not religious; they made no special study of Christian history. Nevertheless the parallels to the Middle Ages are unmistakable. After the fall of Rome literacy declined in the West; only through the efforts of the church were the Bible and the classics preserved. In one scene from Eli a band of ruffians delivers to their boss (Gary Oldman) detritus theyve found in their rampages. There in a pile are the relics of our civilization a copy of O magazine and The Da Vinci Code. In the absence of libraries or schools publishers or printing presses meaningless fun is rendered finally meaningless.

Photo David Lee Denzel Washington kicks butt as a mysterious road warrior toting the worlds last copy of the Bible across a post-apocalyptic North America in the never-boring ""The Book of Eli."" This is Allen and Albert Hughes first film since the underrated ""From Hell"" (2001). Its far more fun than the thematically similar ""The Road"" -- and its also better than you would suspect from a movie being dumped in January the traditional studio deep freeze for problematic projects. The films cool-looking desaturated look (not unlike ""The Road"") plentiful action and Washingtons charismatic gravitas as the taciturn hero make it relatively easy to overlook the pretensions and implausibilities in the script by video-game creator Gary Whitta which may contain more film references than ""Inglourious Basterds."" PHOTOS DENZEL WASHINGTONS MOST MEMORABLE ROLES Washingtons Eli -- a cross between Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name Mel Gibsons Road Warrior and Mormon founder Joseph Smith -- has spent the 30 years after a cataclysmic war walking toward the West Coast in the hope of re-creating civilization using his battered copy of the King James version of the Bible. Expertly wielding a sword to pick his way through pillaging and raping marauders Eli stops at in ruined town to get a charge for his iPod (from Tom Waits yet). There he encounters another of the few remaining old-timers the garrulous gang boss Carnegie (Gary Oldman) a bibliophile who covets Elis Bible so he can use it to refashion the world on his own avaricious terms. A series of well staged and photographed (by Don Burgess) chases and shootouts involving Eli Carnegie and his chief henchman (Ray Stevenson) follows. The most amusing of these is set at the remote home (modeled on the one in ""In Cold Blood"") of a pair of senior citizens who get along by eating their unsuspecting guests. In a clever piece of casting they are played by Michael Gambon (Dumbledore himself) and Frances de la Tour of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire."" Even better the Hughes twins give the still-stunning ""Flashdance"" star Jennifer Beals her first big studio gig in years a juicy supporting role as Carnegies long-suffering mistress who is blind. Mila Kunis (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") is miscast as her equally hot daughter a sort of post-apocalyptic Valley Girl fascinated by stories of the old days who attaches herself to an unwilling Eli as his traveling companion. The film features a couple of big surprise twists in its final reels. One of them is carefully set up. But the other (involving a character played by Malcolm McDowell) is hard to swallow though no more than the idea that residents of a world in chaos would be able to systematically destroy all the Bibles -- because people supposedly blamed it for the apocalypse. The filmmakers have an unusually persuasive star in Washington who can sell lines like ""We had more than we needed"" and ""I walk by faith not by sight."" Will audiences go for this unusual mixture of religion and brutal violence?

Starring Denzel Washington Mila Kunis Gary Oldman Malcolm McDowell Michael Gambon Jennifer Beals Ray Stevenson Tom Waits Lateef Crowder Chris Browning Director Allen Hughs Albert Hughs Running time 158 Release Opened Jan 15 2010  Editorial Review In battle between good and evil we win. Barely.By Michael OSullivanFriday Jan. 15 2010Most people have some good in them and some bad. This is one of the messages of ""The Book of Eli"" a hyper-violent post-apocalyptic Western in the mold of ""Mad Max"" that cant make up its mind whether it wants to be corny or misanthropic.Most movies are also a mix of good and bad. Here follows an accounting of whats right -- and whats wrong -- with the film. Call it The Bookkeeping of ""Eli.""Lets start by putting Denzel Washington in the assets column. The actor beautifully inhabits the films titular hero a laconic solitary gunslinger whos also custodian of a mysterious tome carried in his backpack as he travels a burned-out landscape populated by cannibalistic ""hijackers"" who will happily kill you for your water shoes or ChapStick -- or in Elis case his roadside reading material. Washingtons character -- who packs heat but thanks to an oft-mentioned shortage of bullets in the world also wields a mean crossbow and scimitar -- is an heir to Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name. (We only learn that hes called Eli incidentally and late in the game.) He gives the film half its cool.In the supporting cast Gary Oldman makes a great villain tearing into the part of Carnegie the corrupt small-town boss who also wants Elis book for his personal library with obvious scene-stealing relish. Mila Kunis on the other hand is disappointingly lightweight as Solara the forgettable damsel-in-distress who falls in with Eli and mostly slows him and the movie down. Lets call that one a wash.Another plus is the films gorgeous look. Directed by brothers Albert and Allen Hughes (""From Hell"") ""Eli"" has a bleached-out sepia palette thats drained of almost every color but the occasional blood-red splatter underscoring the corpse-like pallor and violence of the world it depicts.In the debits column That darn book for starters.Whats in it? I cant say outright but the script by Gary Whitta drops heavy-handed hints in the buildup to the big reveal starting with Carnegies reason for coveting it. Its not so much a book he explains but a ""weapon"" whose words will give him power over the hearts and minds of his subjects. Some even say its teachings may have contributed to the conflict leading up to the giant ""flash"" 31 years ago that almost destroyed the planet. Why is Eli so hellbent on protecting this controversial volume? A disembodied voice told him to. (What no burning bush?)If you dont start to get some idea of what Elis carrying -- and why its so precious -- well before the movie makes it explicit youre just not paying attention. When the film finally gives it away though its almost a letdown. Not to mention something of a moral conundrum. Is any book -- even one that many believe holds the power to save the world -- worth sacrificing your own soul? Given the trail of dead bodies that Eli leaves in his wake you might wonder whether hes all that different from Carnegie.The film culminates in a battle worthy of Sam Peckinpah. Holed up in a farmhouse on the side of good are Eli Solara and a hapless old couple named -- here comes the corny part -- George and Martha (Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour). On the misanthropic side Carnegie and a small army of mercenaries equipped with enough machine guns and rocket launchers to turn the farmhouse to toothpicks. So much for the shortage of bullets.That showdown between the righteous and the very very wrong-teous is not however the end of the movie. Theres actually a twist coming worthy of O. Henry. Its more than a little satisfying and just about makes up for all the handsome portentous nonsense that came before putting ""The Book of Eli"" barely if not squarely in the black ink.At area theaters.

Pictures Existing in a demolished world Eli (Denzel Washington) keeps to himself. When hes challenged his machete does the talking for him. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Book of Eli  out of four Stars Denzel Washington Mila Kunis Gary Oldman Jennifer Beals Malcolm McDowell Tom WaitsDirectors Albert and Allen HughesDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for some brutal violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 57 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Post-apocalyptic desolation is spreading like a contagion. MEET THE DIRECTORS Allen and Albert Hughes open up GETTING BIBLICAL Hollywood gets religion TRAILER Get a read on The Book of Eli FAITH AND REASON BLOG Is every scripture-inspired script worthwhile? A month ago we had The Road and a month before that it was 2012. The latest end-of-the-world movie is The Book of Eli which looks as if it borrowed some of the ravaged landscape battered clapboard houses and marauding extras from the world inhabited by Viggo Mortensen in The Road. Computer-generated images of toppled skyscrapers severed freeways decaying cars and rotting skeletons look numbingly familiar. But while devastation disaster and brutality reign in all three movies the difference here is the strident religious message. Poetic psalms uttered amid stylized violence are disconcerting. Religion and bloodshed though linked through much of history make queasy entertainment partners. An attractively grizzled Denzel Washington plays the enigmatic Eli a true believer with quasi-mystical fighting skills. He walks the barren roads fending off desperate highwaymen with a leather-bound King James Bible stowed carefully in his ragged knapsack. Having received what he believes is divine revelation Eli is on a mission to a place he refers to as ""west."" He tries to avoid confrontation but puts up a hellacious fight if challenged. Only Eli and a few others remember how things were before the war that destroyed their world. Young people have not been taught to read. One of the few literates with potent memories is Carnegie (Gary Oldman in over-the-top villainous mode) a venal self-styled dictator of a re-populated ghost town. When Carnegie learns that Eli has the book hes seeking hes determined to wrest it away for nefarious purposes. Carnegie tries to manipulate his adopted daughter Solara (Mila Kunis) as he controls her mother Claudia (Jennifer Beals). The feisty Solara sees in Eli a way out of her oppressive existence. But Kunis seems miscast. Vacuous and far too glam she looks as if she dropped in from a Ray-Ban commercial. In an interview Washington once recounted a pivotal story from his youth. A patron at his mothers hair salon known locally for being able to predict the future told him he would speak to millions in the way of a preacher. Washington who produced the film seems to have taken the words of this neighborhood fortuneteller to heart. But his monosyllabic performance falls short of moving us. He keeps to himself either passively listening to music on earphones or aggressively carving off the hand of someone who crossed him. ""You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back"" he informs a hooligan before applying his magical machete. So much for turning the other cheek. Despite his admiration for Scripture Eli is vicious. He also is selective about on whom he bestows kindness. He endangers an elderly couple (Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour) and is unmoved when they are slain. Hell protect Solara a pretty young girl but let her abused mother fend for herself. A didactic and humorless Western Eli is too laborious for an action film and too brutal to be an inspirational tale. With its handsomely moody look it seems more like an extended music video. Mostly Eli is hampered by drab performances and a ponderous story. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

P Photo Courtesy Of Warner Bros. P Book of Eli Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Deliver us from ""Eli."" Travolta had his ""Battlefield Earth"" Costner had his ""Waterworld"" and now Denzel Washington has his truly awful sci-fi epic ""The Book of Eli."" This futuristic action catastrophe seemingly collaged together from the lesser works of Vin Diesel is an affront to anyone with even moderate blood flow to the brain. Bringing his trademark gravitas to situations that get guffaws Washington plays a messiah figure marching purposefully across an arid postapocalyptic wilderness. The action takes place 30 years from now. After a nuclear war the dust clouds have settled. Central government is gone scattered communities operate under the sway of feudal overlords and bandits in Mad Max attire bushwhack unfortunate travelers. When they set upon Eli he corrects them with a flashy mix of kung fu and Bowie knife work. Eli is carrying a valuable book in his rucksack a book that he will protect at all costs and that the films evil-dripping villain Carnegie (Gary Oldman) will kill to possess. The book holds the secret of humanitys future and to the snarling despot ""its not a book its a weapon."" As anyone who has seen the trailer is aware the book is the sole surviving copy of the Bible. Its interesting to consider that a King James could repair the ruined fabric of our nation but in this context the idea feels like a cynical ploy to bring stay-at-home Christian audiences into the heathen multiplex. The notion that this bestseller could vanish is a plot point as hard to swallow as Elis decision to wear a canvas military raincoat in the scorching desert heat. But then ""The Book of Eli"" is a triumph of visuals over common sense. This is a world where thugs lie in wait endlessly beside a deserted highway in the expectation that someone will wander their way. Gary Whitta edited PC Gamer magazine before writing this screenplay which may explain his fondness for minimal plot cartoon balloon dialogue and exploding vehicles. His notion of drama will set most viewers a-giggle. Horribly directed by Albert and Allen Hughes Washington approaches each scene of bloated silliness with a Sphynx-like solemnity. Every moment is played to the hilt for mythic reverence or over-the-top violence. As the villain Oldman is generic neither good nor bad bringing nothing more to the part than wed get from a Dennis Hopper or a Geoffrey Rush. THE BOOK OF ELI  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for violence language. Mila Kunis generates a smallish spark as Carnegies adopted daughter assigned to double-cross the stoic Eli. She brings a degree of determination to her character developing an independent female character whos not always in need of rescuing but her effort is wasted on this hoot-worthy material. The film comes complete with a last-minute surprise ending so arbitrary and bizarre it caused a member of the preview audience to drop his head into his hands and groan out loud. That member was me.

The great mans new personal secretary 23-year-old Valentin (James McAvoy) is working by candlelight in his spartan bedroom when a stunning young woman Masha (Kerry Condon) opens the door. She like he is a committed Tolstoyan a member of a utopian community that Tolstoy has established on the grounds of his grand estate to celebrate the virtues of communal property passive resistance vegetarianism and celibate love. Valentins commitment to celibacy--and vegetables--has been earnest and thus far unwavering but the philosophy of the free-thinking Masha is that love should be celebrated with body and soul so her seduction begins. The entire film is a seduction one that draws us into a vanished world where Count Leo Tolstoy and his wife of 48 years Countess Sofya come to joyous tempestuous life in a matched pair of magnificent performances by Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren. A scene from ""The Last Station"" a new biographical film about Leo Tolstoy starring Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren. Speakeasy Qamp;A with Christopher Plummmer This Tolstoy is larger than life in the eyes of that world--hes the most famous writer on the face of the planet--yet warmly and disarmingly life-size in Mr. Plummers portrayal. He is by his own admission an erratic Tolstoyan. Taking Valentin on a leisurely stroll through a birch forest he recalls longingly a passionate affair of the flesh with a Tartar girl who is by now a white-haired old woman if she isnt dead. He still adores Sofya and succumbs to her blandishments in another seduction scene that speaks eloquently for longevity. But he can neither fathom nor endure his wifes ceaseless sniping at the way he sees contemporary society (""You think because the peasants are poor theyre morally superior"") or presents himself to it (""Why do you insist on dressing like a man who looks after the sheep? Youre a count for Gods sake"") ENLARGE The Last Station also stars Paul Giamatti and James McAvoy as followers of the great novelist. Sony Pictures Classics In fact Sofya is the titan of the piece. Rather than a literary lion shes an enchanting lioness who gets all the best lines and goes for the dramatic jugular. Ms. Mirren goes for laughs gasps grins and tears and gets them all. Having found a vulnerable woman in ""The Queen"" she finds a virago in this countess--at one point Sofya writhes on the floor of her husbands study while she rages in flamboyant fury against him and his chief disciple the wily Chertkov who is played by Paul Giamatti. (Mr. Giamatti is awfully good though he might have flattened a bit of his archness and dispensed with a few twirls of Chertkovs waxed mustache.) But the scene part Feydeau farce and part antic ""Antigone"" is a stark reminder that the countess is vulnerable too. Her nemesis Chertkov the zealous keeper of Tolstoys flame wants the old man to bequeath his estate and all his royalties to the Russian people leaving Sofya with nothing. ENLARGE Helen Mirren (left) as Leo Tolstoys wife Countess Sofya. Sony Pictures Classics ""The Last Station"" was adapted from the novel by Jay Parini and its structure is fairly intricate--parallel love stories (Tolstoy and Sofya Valentin and Masha) plus interlocking triangles (Sofya and Chertkov contending for Tolstoys soul Sofya and Chertkov pumping Valentin for information about one anothers grip on Tolstoys property). Before and after anything else though Mr. Hoffmans film is a deeply satisfying entertainment that recognizes no distinction between lively and profound. (I like to think his license for stylish silliness dates back to the making of his 1991 soap-opera opus ""Soapdish."") Its full of gorgeous vistas--the cinematographer was Sebastian Edschmid--as well as intriguing details reporters and photographers even newsreel photographers hanging on Tolstoys every word; a gramophone that repeats Tolstoys words to his displeasure (hes something of a Luddite); a delicate wordless moment when Valentin first enters Tolstoys study sees annotated pages strewn across his desk and touches one reverentially. (Mr. McAvoys performance is superb in its own right.) The movies title with its religious overtones is a literal reference to the railway station where Leo Tolstoy died a few days after leaving his wife and home presumably to become a wandering ascetic (though he brought his personal physician with him). The little station in the middle of a vast Russian nowhere quickly became the site of a protomedia frenzy when telegraph wires flashed news of Tolstoys illness and Sofya came to see her beloved husband for the last time. The storys climax turns out to be anticlimactic a predictable contrivance that pits the countess for the last time against Chertkov who wants to manage Tolstoys death as he managed his life. But the ending seems contrived only in contrast to what has gone before--a lovely quicksilver version of literary history with the accent on young love that emerges unbidden and old love that endures. ENLARGE Denzel Washington as the titular wanderer in The Book of Eli. Warner Bros. The Book of Eli Religious overtones slowly grow into the dominant tone of ""The Book of Eli"" a bizarre and sententious pastiche--part Samurai legend part postapocalyptic western with a surprise ending--starring Denzel Washington as a wanderer heading westward with a Bible in his dusty backpack. Its not just any Bible but the last one on earth; and Eli isnt just any wanderer but a master swordsman/archer/gunslinger wholl do anything thats required to protect his book. The story requires a greater leap of faith than I was willing or able to muster since Eli is also a saintly pilgrim on a God-given mission to save a ruined world. Worse movies than this one have been taken seriously and ""The Book of Eli"" which is being marketed heavily though not exclusively to Christian audiences has the virtue of audacity; its ""The Road"" with a message of hope. The directors were the Hughes brothers Allen and Albert (the twins last film shot almost a decade ago was the Jack the Ripper thriller ""From Hell"") working from a script by Gary Whitta and the elaborate production was given a distinctive sepia look by the cinematographer Don Burgess. Mr. Washington manages to sustain a heroic aura in the face of some serious silliness. Gary Oldman is scruffily impressive--and praise be occasionally funny--as Carnegie an outlaw turned local despot whos determined to separate Eli from his book because in a perverse way he recognizes the Bibles power ""Its a weapon"" Carnegie says ""aimed right at the weak and the desperate."" But the movie is aimed at two targets moving in different directions--people of faith and fans of violence. While the religious content makes itself felt sometimes strongly the heavy action quotient--the story of Eli the slasher--tears feelings to tatters. Jennifer Beals is Carnegies blind wife Claudia and Mila Kunis is Solara his sexy stepdaughter. In the midst of a veritable valley of death Solara looks and sounds like a Valley Girl. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Inside Man (2006) Denzel Washington is an unflappable hostage negotiator and Christopher Plummer is a banker with a secret in this film directed by Spike Lee thats partly a police procedural and partly a comic fantasy that revels in the richness of New York Citys polyglot culture. Clive Owen is Dalton a brainy criminal who strides into a banks Wall Street branch and announces that he and three friends ""are making a very large withdrawal."" The screenplay by Russell Gewirtz operates confidently in action mode but is always willing to pause for an oddball encounter a rambling story or a great tossed-off joke. ENLARGE The Man Who Would Be King (1975) Christopher Plummer is Rudyard Kipling in John Hustons peerless version of the classic Kipling story. While Huston dreamed of having Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart play the leads that pairing was not to be. Once youve seen the movie though its next to impossible to imagine anyone else in the roles but the stars who play them Sean Connery and Michael Caine as Daniel and Peachy two worldly ex-sergeants looking for unworldly wealth in the mountain kingdom of Kafiristan. Saeed Jaffrey is the desperately decent Billy Fish. The cinematographer was Oswald Morris and Maurice Jarre wrote the music. ENLARGE Calendar Girls (2003) Helen Mirren co-stars with Julie Walters in ""Calendar Girls"" a not-nude iteration of ""The Full Monty"" (which was hardly a show-all extravaganza). The clever script by Juliette Towhidi and Tim Firth takes off from a real-life story. In 1999 a group of middle-age women in a small English town sought to raise a few pounds for charity by publishing a calendar with whimsical photos of themselves in the nude performing such traditionally domestic tasks as arranging flowers. The calendar of course became an international hit. The movie is very funny and surprisingly likable until it goes Hollywood. -- Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Pictures release. Photo Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures Review The Book of Eli 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The Book of Eli Futuristic drama. Starring Denzel Washington Gary Oldman and Mila Kunis. Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A hairless cat munches on a human carcass. This takes place in the very first shot of ""The Book of Eli"" and the immediate thought is ""Oh no."" Over the next few moments the worst fears seem to be confirmed Denzel Washington is seen loping/trudging in his distinctive way across a bleak blasted landscape. There are burned-out cars and human skeletons everywhere but not a sign of life. No this isnt the end of the world. This is what it looks like after the end with Denzel eating cat meat and sharing his dinner with a rat that happens by. The Hughes brothers get us ready for a wallow in postapocalyptic gloom but their movie doesnt stay bleak and meditative - nor simply ugly with flashes of violence. Instead they give us a dynamic story sprinkled with some interesting ideas about the preciousness of culture and how societies might rebuild themselves. For viewers over 40 the movie holds yet another satisfaction. In the world of the film the great ""flash"" came 30 years earlier which means that only middle-aged people have the slightest clue about anything. Theyre the only ones who know how to read or remember what a society might be like. At one point Gary Oldman as the would-be king of a makeshift town tells one of his henchmen to look for something hidden ""behind the TV."" The henchman just stands there. ""Whats a TV?"" As Eli who has apparently been walking west for three decades - hes on a quest - Washington has the steady gait of a man who is in no hurry yet will not be stopped. When he lopes into the town and kills half the people in the bar (hey they started it) he attracts the attention of Carnegie (Oldman). The rest of the film sets itself up as a clash between a good mans single-minded sense of mission and an evil mans single-minded pursuit of power. That Oldman is a remarkable actor will not come as news but to see him here is to marvel at the way he seems to channel an entire spirit and personality for this role. His performance as Carnegie is at least to some degree the product of observation. He is giving us a certain type of wily middle-American sleaze but his portrait goes so beyond imitation - into the realm of thought and worldview and attitude and past history - that you really have to wonder how he does it. You even have to wonder if he knows how he does it. The idea at the heart of ""The Book of Eli"" is that big ideas rebuild society but who will own those ideas humanitarians or dictators? The clash between Eli and Carnegie is one might say a miniversion of the clash that produced the flash. The movie depicts that cycle and struggle beginning all over again with time reserved for action scenes and for gazing on postapocalyptic chic As the prettiest girl in what passes for town Mila Kunis wears skinny jeans and lots of layers. As for Washington not every actor can play humanitys best and only hope but he can and does - not a small thing. Well save for later the question of what is with Hollywoods current preoccupation with the apocalypse. And also the other question that goes with it Should we be getting paranoid right around now? -- Advisory Contains violence strong language and sexual situations.

(David Lee) Joe Neumaier Thursday January 14 2010 505 PM Title Book of Eli In terms of postapocalyptic dramas ""The Book of Eli"" lands somewhere between ""The Postman"" (civilization needs ritual) and ""Fahrenheit 451"" (literacy saves humanity). Theres a wide road between those two so for single-mindedness ""Eli"" has screenwriter Gary Whittas boring revelation that religion is everything.From the beginning thats not a secret - its right in the movies title - and hell even Mad Max became a Christ figure beyond Thunderdome. But the fun in most life-after-Armageddon stories is seeing unique ways the world could be destroyed before it hopefully gets rebuilt. A bit of that survives here sometimes in original ways though its hazy how an iPod can be recharged without electricity or why cities are decimated while swing sets are left standing.Yet it all comes down to one simplistic idea and the result feels like a one-film evangelical movement.The mysterious Eli (Denzel Washington) for his part is a sort-of one-man samurai priesthood. During a genuinely creepy first 15 minutes Eli wanders a bleached-out landscape hunting hairless cats and dodging corpses just as he has done for 30 years since a religious war resulted in a ""flash of light"" that tore open the sky.When the loner comes upon a shantytown ruled by a Mussolini fan called Carnegie (a menacing Gary Oldman) who influences people through fear Elis hunted because of one item in his backpack Earths last remaining Bible. After the war all Bibles (and presumably Korans and Talmuds) were destroyed but Carnegie needs it to control the masses. So Eli escapes with the book and followed by a teen named Solara (Mila Kunis too punky to be prophetic) heads west where the voices inside him say humanity will begin anew.Then this Hughes brothers movie while not brainless quickly devolves. Solara is unschooled about ""the life before"" allowing for lots of pious plot exposition. Theres even a major twist meant as allegory but it doesnt jell with the rest of the movie. A scene with a wild-eyed old man (Michael Gambon) - necessary in any good postapocalyptic flick - feels dropped in. If that wasnt enough theres even a second wild-eyed old man (Malcolm McDowell) thrown in for good measure.Washington though is solid and soulful as always a tough measured presence even when metaphorically carrying God across the desert. Like Charlton Heston Kurt Russell and Will Smith youd want a guy like Denzel around when the end is nigh. Too bad ""The Book of Eli"" is so preachy it buries the subtlety he brings forth.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Book of Eli is ""The Road with twice the plot four times the ammunition and half the brains; itll probably make 10 times the money. The movie a post-apocalyptic action-drama is serious in the style of a portentous comic book lots of slow-motion attitude punctuated by sped-up mayhem. You can tell it means business because cinematographer Don Burgess has left his palette at home - as is the current fashion colors have been bleached out of every shot leaving behind a burnished sepia wasteland. Its quite beautiful in a diseased way.Denzel Washington strides through the film as Eli Walker generic survivor. Hes walking in the footsteps of all those whove come before him - Will Smith in ""I Am Legend Kevin Costner in ""The Postman Mel Gibson in ""The Road Warrior Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Nine (wait wrong disaster). He has a Clint Eastwood man-with-no-name thing going on too not to mention a little samurai on the side. In an early sequence a gang of atavistic roadside sleazebags descend on Walker beneath an overpass intent on robbing and eating him and the camera pulls back to watch him dispatch them all in silhouetted longshot. Its a striking sequence as if Quentin Tarantino had decided to try his hand at shadow puppetry.If that were all there were to ""The Book of Eli the movie might be good nasty fun. Walker is toting a book with him though and its not just any book but THE book all other King James Bibles having been destroyed in a fit of mob pique after the bombs dropped 30 years ago (taking the Gideons with them apparently). Why those other Bibles didnt make it but Walkers iPod has survived over three decades is a mystery for the ages; at least he gets to chill out to Al Green which is all the Good Lord some of us need.""The Book of Eli takes an interesting turn when Walker walks into a frontier town Suddenly were in a post-nuclear western complete with a goodhearted saloon girl (Mila Kunis) her shady-lady mother (Jennifer Beals) showdowns in the street and a big bad boss in the person of Carnegie played by Gary Oldman as if hed borrowed Daniel Day-Lewiss John Huston impression from ""There Will Be Blood.A shout-out to casting director Mindy Marin who has stuffed the movie with oddball familiar faces. Fringe benefits include Tom Waits in the Walter Brennan role of the towns old cuss and Michael Gambon (Dumbledore in the ""Harry Potter movies) as one half of an elegant survivor couple with suspiciously shaky hands. Toward the end a chipper Malcolm McDowell shows up in a fright wig as though Alex the Droog had finally found a purpose in life.Washington? Hes on poised auto-pilot sad to say although some of his line readings bristle with caustic wit. (A revelatory twist toward the end is supposed to explain a lot about Walker; it doesnt.) ""The Book of Eli comes down to a face-off between Walker and Carnegie for possession of the Book the latter craving a short-term power base and the former wanting to preserve it for future generations.Preserve what though? Screenwriter Gary Whitta doesnt seem to know. Asked what the Books gist is Walker says ""Do to others what youd want them to do to you - which is true enough but exactly as deep as youd expect from a movie that combines the continuance of Jesus Christs message of universal love with bone-crushing violence and amputated limbs. But hey a little something for everyone.The directors are brothers Albert and Allen Hughes who made a splash in the early 1990s with gangsta fables ""Menace II Society and ""Dead Presidents and have struggled to find their footing since. ""Eli is their first feature since 2001s brooding Jack the Ripper mystery ""From Hell and it references other movies and genres without ever quite settling into its own groove. The movies certainly watchable - the brothers are born filmmakers - but its never quite convinced of itself and so it never comes close to convincing us. The Hughes put most of their creativity into the action scenes which crunch and spurt and gurgle with panache. Im not sure the Books message though is ""Let us spray.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

It stars Denzel Washington as a man on a mission a guy you mess with at your own peril.In the opening scene where the grizzled Eli aims his crossbow at a feral cat and roasts it for a solitary supper the implication is that after the apocalypse human survival depends solely on food.Yet the force of this haunting allegory from Albert and Allen Hughes (Menace II Society From Hell) is its argument that spiritual sustenance may be more critical for survival than the comestible sort.Like The Road John Hillcoats fine movie based on the Cormac McCarthy novel Eli shows how the scattered survivors of the cataclysm - here the result of both holy war and solar calamity - now travel in cannibalistic tribes or are nomads scavenging the sun-scorched land. With great stealth (and sunglasses to protect him from the suns lethal rays) Eli walks west 30 years after the apocalypse.When attacked by human predators Eli is unafraid to use his hunting knife or handgun on anyone who views him as a dining or supplies opportunity. His lightning-bolt knife skills would be the envy of a Tarantino hero. Is Eli a manifestation of Elijah prophet and railer against false gods who figures in both Old and New Testaments and the Koran?Elis blade- bullet-pocked and otherwise scarified torso is a physical inventory of the attacks he has survived while protecting the precious cargo he carries.In Elis backpack is a book the title of which you can probably guess that sustains him and keeps him on his path. Only those who lived before the apocalypse can read. Threaded through Elis story is the importance of books in building and rebuilding civilization. And sometimes people draw inspiration from bad books.Look no further than Carnegie (Gary Oldman) sheriff of a tumbledown bartertown where Eli gets detained. The sheriff is a reader. But given his black shirt - not to mention his intimidating office in a crumbling movie theater - it appears that Carnegie has been using the biography of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini as his gospel.Carnegie suspects Eli has the book he wants and sends Solara (Mila Kunis expressionless) the daughter of his mistress Claudia (Jennifer Beals) to seduce it from the wanderer. Instead Solara is inspired by Eli and escapes with him leaving Carnegie and his thugs to pursue them across the parched desert.Though not as lyrical as The Road which benefits from both its visual artistry and its humanist perspective The Book of Eli employs the genre conventions of the western to make mythic its principal character. Washington ever potent brings to the role the full force of his thousand-mile stare and regenerative smile. His pilgrim of the postapocalypse sees beyond his immediate rut and a world thats bigger than himself. In a word Eli is inspirational.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the wake of The Passion Of The Christ the expected deluge of big-budget Christian entertainments has never quite materialized but the logline for the post-apocalyptic thriller The Book Of Eli--about a Biblical warrior who protects the last known copy of the Good Book--suggests a late start. Working from a script by Gary Whitta the Hughes brothers Albert and Allen have made a stark affirmation of faith as a guiding light for a broken lawless civilization but to their credit the film stops well short of proselytizing. In their world theres no intrinsic good in Bible-thumpers spreading the word; it all depends on whos doing the thumping. Wandering the scorched landscape familiar to countless other post-apocalyptic movies--The Road Warrior and A Boy And His Dog especially though the film owes something to 70s anti-Westerns too--Denzel Washington plays a loner heading west with precious cargo. Thirty-one years after ""the flash"" wiped out much of humanity Washington dodges the roadside marauders and cannibals who scramble for scarce resources and when he cant dodge them he runs them through with a sharp sword. While stranded in a Wild West town Washington butts heads with fellow bibliophile Gary Oldman a nefarious power broker who believes the Bible will help him expand his empire. A miscast Mila Kunis also stars as a conspicuously glamorous young woman who supports this strangers mission. The Book Of Eli takes the form of an ultra-violent graphic novel with Washington as a steely Man With No Name type who cuts a righteous path through the gullets of sinners and savages. At a time when theaters are experiencing a glut of doomsday scenarios the Hughes ashen bombed-out future world looks a little too familiar no matter how crisply they present it. But the showdown between Washington and a deliciously hammy Oldman complicates the films overt religiosity making it less a testament to a Christian God than to the power of the written word. Its hero may be on a mission from above but in a refreshing twist the fate of mankind rests with the literate.

Comments (11) The Book of Eli Recommended Video Rated R  118 minutes  2010 Brothers Albert and Allen Hughes (Menace II Society) redeem themselves from their overrated 2001 Jack the Ripper thriller From Hell with this entertainingly screwball take on the postapocalyptic survival yarn. Denzel Washington plays an ass-kicking former Kmart associate on a mission from God to carry the last Bible on earth to fertile spiritual ground on the west coast. Passing through the devastated red states he falls into the clutches of erudite thug lord Gary Oldman who would misuse the book to ideologically reenslave the few remaining humans. The sepia-toned palette gets a little wearying but the dialogue is hilarious the violence is crunchy and cameos by Tom Waits and topflight Brit character actor Michael Gambon are worth the ticket price alone.

The Book of Eli Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2010) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-book-of-eli-2010,200,thebookofeli23,thebookofeli,rogerebert
"Book of Eli The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; book-of-eli-the ) Book of Eli The (United States 2010) January 13 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Arguably the international fascination with the apocalypse has never been bigger than it is today and it has resulted in films like Knowing The Road 2012 and The Book of Eli arriving in theaters within a 12-month window. The movies have different vantage points ideas and themes but their common thread - the end of the world - makes one wonder if there is such a streak of pessimism in todays society that a dire event of this nature provides compelling escapism. In staking out its place in an increasingly crowded field The Book of Eli provides audiences with a parable advocating faith as the path through darkness. The words of the Bible will not be silenced as long as there are lips to speak them and ears to hear them. The problem with The Book of Eli is that the narrative isnt a match for its sentiments. The script feels like its an iteration or two short of a final draft. For about 3/4 of the running length the movie holds together reasonably well - there are some hiccups but those are the sort of things one expects in a post-apocalyptic movie. Unfortunately it all falls apart during the final half hour with an avalanche of implausibilities contrivances and hurried resolutions that generate a bad aftertaste. One senses that more thought and a polished screenplay could have taken viewers to essentially the same place without all of the bumps and potholes that make The Book of Elis final act an uneven and occasionally unpleasant ride. Often post-apocalyptic movies are filmed using desaturated color but The Hughes Brothers take this technique to an extreme that results in The Book of Eli having a specific aesthetic. Its virtually black-and-white. There are times when a little color is allowed to peek through as if to remind us that the movie isnt really monochromatic but it might as well have been filmed with the same stock utilized in the 30s and 40s. It is effective and evocative and makes the bleakness of the world seem more forceful and immediate. There are some stylish shots such as an early fight scene which is presented almost entirely in silhouette - black figures seen struggling against a bright backdrop. The almost complete absence of dialogue for the first 15 minutes allows us to focus on the visuals and it gets The Book of Eli off to an uncommonly strong start. Unfortunately the good will purchased at the beginning doesnt last all the way to the end. The back story is muddled. The Book of Eli transpires 30 years after a cataclysmic event depopulates most of the planet but the movie is unclear about the specifics. On several occasions a ""war"" is referenced and in one instance the implication is that the conflict was motivated by religion (hence the mass burning of Bibles by the survivors). The flash-blindness of some characters is consistent with what can occur from observing a nuclear blast. However there are no indications of radiation sickness and the general pattern of destruction seems more consistent with a general global disaster. Theres also an odd passage of dialogue about the sky opening up and the sun coming toward the Earth. Ultimately as in most post-apocalyptic movies the cause of humanitys near extinction is irrelevant but it would be appreciated for the subject to be approached with a degree of consistency. Eli (Denzel Washington) is a modern-day prophet. He walks the Earth heading West with the last known copy of the Bible in his backpack. God has informed him to proceed to a place where the Word can take root in this new world and woe be to anyone who gets in his way. Eli has superhero-like skills with a scimitar and is equally proficient with guns. His travels take him to a town thats like a place out of the Old West populated by outlaws and the people they prey upon and lorded over by a marshal-like figure named Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie is an ambitious fellow who believes the Bible can be employed as a weapon to win the hearts and minds of the undertrodden and allow him to build a local empire. Eli isnt interested in joining forces with Carnegie so he ends up on the run accompanied by Solara (Mila Kunis) an attractive young woman whose life he saves. The actors are all fine but The Book of Eli lacks a standout performance. Denzel Washington is credible as a solitary figure who strides with a larger-than-life gait through the crumbling wreckage of a world where faith has been lost. Gary Oldman who has perfected a pattern for playing the heavy avoids going so far over the top that were tempted to laugh at him. Mila Kunis looks too comely and clean to have been raised in the cesspool where shes living but thats usually the case with attractive actresses in movies like this. The demands of the role prove to be within her range which is perhaps surprising considering she has been thus far pigeonholed into more lightweight parts. The Book of Eli draws inspiration from three sources the Western the road movie and the superhero action film. There are times when its as if the Hughes Brothers are channeling Sergio Leone not the least of which occurs when Eli and Carnegies henchman (played by Ray Stevenson) face each other across a stretch of barren street. All thats missing are the tumbleweeds. Eli is on a journey and his trek brings him in contact with a variety of odd characters (most end up dead). And his powers which include incredible aptitude in hand-to-hand struggles unerring accuracy with a gun and seeming invulnerability to bullets would make Batman envious. There are things to appreciate about The Book of Eli. The Hughes Brothers depiction of future Earth is suitably bleak - especially the images of the Golden Gate Bridge. Their direction of the action scenes is crisp and kinetic and does not rely on fast cuts and and editing-room assembly to make the fights seem fast and furious. Theres also an undercurrent of dark humor that occasionally surfaces as in a scene featuring a cameo by Michael Gambon. The film is never uninteresting even when its storyline turns preposterous. The Book of Eli is a decidedly mixed bag and not the most distinguished entry into the rapidly growing genre of which it finds itself a member.

The Book of Eli Fair to good Directors Albert and Allen Hughes. Cast Denzel Washington Gary Oldman Mila Kunis. Rating R for brutal violence and language. RELATED Qamp;A with Elis Mila Kunis Denzel Washington Book maker Spotlight Denzel Washington Movies about the apocalypse Its over-the-top violence is cartoonish at times menacing at others - which is a good thing. And truly if one must wander a barren post-apocalyptic landscape with somebody who better to wander with than Denzel Washington? Washington is Eli a man who has been walking for the 30 years since war laid waste to the planet. Survivors have long since turned desperate; imagine a cross between the worlds of ""The Road"" and ""Mad Max"" and youll have an idea. It has gotten so grim that when strangers show up in a town the first thing theyre asked to do is hold out their hands to see if theyre steady. It seems that too much cannibalism leaves you with the shakes. Along with the provisions Eli scrounges along the way he carries with great care a book. To him its clearly more than that though. Its a totem of sorts and he guards it with his life. Theres much to guard it against of course. But your run-of-the-mill roving savage is nothing compared with Carnegie (Gary Oldman). He runs the town that Eli finds himself in and he wants the book badly. He has in fact searched the world for it for years sending bands of marauders out to find it. Its contents hes convinced are all he lacks to take over whats left of the world. Eli naturally will have none of it. He hasnt guarded the book all this time to hand it over to a guy so obviously devious that he lacks only a handlebar mustache to twirl. So he leaves the town albeit violently with Solara (Mila Kunis) in tow; shes had enough of Carnegies mistreatment of her and her mother Claudia (Jennifer Beals). (Like some survivors of the war Claudia was blinded; Carnegie isnt exactly the picture of compassion.) A chase ensues turning ""The Book of Eli"" into a mash-up of road trip action-adventure fare and that old reliable the buddy movie. The film is better when Eli is on his own frankly; Kunis is a fine-enough actress but this is Washington at his most tail-kicking if occasionally comic-book intense - brooding silent until pushed too far. But Solara does give him someone to protect and more importantly someone to explain the books contents and importance to (although most of the audience will have figured that out long before). ""The Book of Eli"" is directed by the Hughes brothers from a script by Gary Whitta. They bring the right touch to it for the most part though things get heavy-handed toward the end when the message of the film is laid on a bit thick. The fun here is in watching Washington a sort of avenging angel and Oldman who has a ball with Carnegies trumped-up accent and scheming. Throw in the stylized look of the ruined landscape and you have a most agreeable film. One note There is a bit of a twist not obvious (at least not to me) which I pass along solely to heighten your observation of the films details. Its more fun that way.

Posted January 15 2010 -- 1200 AM EST The clouds are gray the scorched earth is gray and the age-old nuclear ash falling from the sky is gray. If you look closely at Denzel Washington as he saunters in slow motion through a bombed-out hotel lobby full of rotten-toothed ruffians you can see that his hair and beard are flecked with gray as well. Is it just our imagination or is the aridly desolate post-apocalyptic road movie showing its age? In the last 35 years or so there have been an awful lot of them going back to A Boy and His Dog (1976) and of course The Road Warrior (1982) -- the greatest of all futuristic wasteland thrillers -- and most recently The Road. Im not sure if anyone was clamoring for another one of these films just now but one thing is certain We dont need The Book of Eli a ponderous dystopian bummer that might be described as The Road Warrior without car chases or The Road without humanity. Whats left? A lot of wide-open barren desert space shot from music-video angles (think the Red Hot Chili Peppers ""Give It Away""). The directors Allen and Albert Hughes do their best to make the landscape threatening by filling it with a token sprinkle of homicidal bikers and cannibals plus Gary Oldman as an evil ringleader whose scariest aspect is his harshly photographed skin. Roving through it all is Washingtons Eli a monosyllabic lone gunslinger in a signature outfit of sunglasses kaffiyeh and knapsack packed with lethal blade. Hes a mystical avenger who has been wandering through the wilderness for 30 years toting a leather-bound King James Bible from which he plucks ominous quotes. He makes apocalyptic prophecy sound like a rerun. Id be willing to forgive The Book of Eli its portentous sins if it had kick-ass action scenes and every so often Eli does slice and dice the stuffing out of half a dozen hooligans at once or he presides over a gun battle in which the bullets clatter and echo with full-metal zing. But those are just about the only scenes in the movie that have a pulse. At their best the Hughes brothers have been brilliant directors Their first film the 1993 mind-of-a-gangbanger classic Menace II Society (made when they were just 20) established them as visceral and psychological prodigies and the criminally underrated From Hell (2001) was a gothic-shock serial-killer mystery that featured Johnny Depp in one of his finest performances. (Had he been the mainstream superstar he is today back when the film was released it might have been a sensation.) The Book of Eli is the first Hughes brothers movie that feels stripped of drama imagination sensibility. Some may find the film worth sitting through simply for its final ""Whoa"" of a twist but the Hughes brothers direct most of it as if they were glorified end-of-the-world set decorators. The Book of Eli is like a movie based on a graphic novel you dont want to read. D See all of this weeks reviews Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Trail To Everest Summit By Philip Weiss  04/07/03 1200am In early April 1953 a gangling man with a lantern jaw stood alongside a shorter dark-skinned man in high meadow outside Thyangboche Nepal studying the way to the northeast. Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa were seven weeks away from becoming household names and 50 years later the celebrations of Everests conquest have already begun. There are commemorative climbs planned the Queen will host a gala jubilee dinner. The Hillary Step will loom again. And there will be nods to the hundreds whove followed as if that were something to boast about. Fifty years is actually a very long time to an ingenious race. Fifty years after the internal combustion engine Henry Ford perfected the Model T. Fifty years after the Wright brothers ordinary Americans could cross the Atlantic on a whim. Fifty years after the double helix we have miracle cures and Dolly the sheep. Nothing like that can be said of Everest. We might have expected a river of humanity to follow the brave climbers-theres been barely a trickle. Base camp is barred to all but a handful of the enterprising rich and the trail up from there remains chancy and vertiginous. When postman Doug Hansen dared to reprise Sir Edmunds feat in 1996 he slipped woozily to his death from the summit even as eight others died in a horror show of reckless guides and sudden weather. Everests slopes are littered with corpses in various states of glaciation and the South Col has become a landfill for oxygen bottles crampons and excrement. For all those who say that 53 is a monument to human daring how many will acknowledge that the years since have been a monument to human diffidence? I believe its time we commit ourselves to the proposition that even an ordinary person has the right to say ""I climbed Everest too."" Its time that a road is built up the mountain. It goes without saying that a highway up Everest is a daunting task. ""If theres a will theres probably a way"" Jim Spaid the roadway construction engineer for the State of Washington concedes. ""But it would have to be a very strong will."" Fair enough but its not like Ed Hillary woke up one day 50 years ago and decided he was going to climb Mount Everest. The British had sent major expeditions up the hill for more than 30 years before that. A lot of money was spent several men lost their lives (notably George Mallory who said ""Because its there.""). The Times of London was firmly behind the project as I think the television networks would have to be now if my idea is to gain any traction. ""Everyone to Everest"" would require the cooperation of several governments and an international coalition to apply pressure to the balky backward Nepalis (though if such a coalition did not materialize America could do it on its own calling the Brits to their former glory too). Its no stretch to say that Detroit is willing. Television ads that show S.U.V.s navigating absurd terrains would seem to have Everest as a not so-hidden agenda. Bob Wilson of the Colorado Department of Transportation says that cars will sputter in thin air over 16000 feet but the answer to that is that Mallory died in 24 in tweed and hobnail boots; a successful summit involved the perfection of a lot of new gear from Primus stoves to down jackets to crampons and this job will demand similar innovations. The market is huge. What wouldnt Donald Trump or you or I pay for a drink at a bar on the South Col with its majestic views? Licensing of Everest and Everest Road images would be tightly controlled even the sale of bumper stickers saying ""This Car Climbed Everest"" (or if thats not to your taste a round white sticker for the rear windshield with a black circle and the letters EVT). A doubter says ""Its one thing to get a highway up to Base Camp at 17000 feet following trekking trails but after that there is the Khumbu Glacier and Icefall a matrix of crevasses in which house-sized pieces of ice tumble hundreds of feet. How do you get a car through that?"" Im no engineer but roadmakers have tackled challenges that rival the shoulders of Everest. There are frozen roads on permafrost in Alaska and a cog railway and road to the top of Pikes Peak in Colorado which is half Everests height. Shelf roads in Colorado have been blasted on 80-degree slopes says CDOTs Wilson. ""You could save yourself a lot of trouble by tunneling under the Khumbu"" says Rob Buchanan a contributing editor to Outside magazine. ""The French have punched many holes through the Alps including under Mont Blanc."" As for the knife edge of the southeastern summit ridge Mr. Buchanan recommends flattening portions of it. ""This road could save a lot of lives"" he says. The real obstacle here is not granite its a 50-year failure of imagination. Henry Ford was mocked in his time when he dreamed that every household should have a working car now it is our turn to imagine the schoolgirl in kickpleats and the wrinkled war veteran alike stepping from the bus their faces lit up by the highest light the world has to offer. A blueprint a blasting cap a switchback or two and there you are atop the Hillary Step. Let them hump it from there I say. Let our little road curl to a halt and the Explorers and Aztecs park on a slant at the overlook. Preserve the summit exactly as Sir Edmund and Tenzing found it we should commit ourselves to that now and demand the same commitment from the Chinese if they build a road from the north as I expect they will. Still this being one of the worlds great spaces one cant help but envision touches that frame the experience Sherpas in maroon pantaloons and perhaps even some gold braid to accompany people the last hundred feet white George Segal figures of Sir Edmund and Tenzing outside an educational center something like the natural-looking centers in stone and beams that the Interior Department has helped to build that blend into the landscape at some of the Indian reservations out west and a gift shop selling black-and-white postcards showing where Mallory sleeps where Jon Krakauer napped while Beck Weathers froze where Sandy Pittman did or did not get short-roped. This is big I know this is big big big this is where big goes when bigger has gone off to bed and biggest is just a littleness on the valley floor. But dream with me dare step out imagine and for anyone with a breath of discouragement two words revolving restaurant.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The fourth film from directors Allen and Albert Hughes The Book of Eli centers on the Christianity that was at the margins of their previous films--hypocritically misused by Bokeem Woodbines bush-crazy marine turned pulpit-pounder turned stick-up man in Dead Presidents and the sanctimonious grandparents in Menace II Society.""I dont think God really cares too much about us or he wouldnt have put us here. . . . Look where we stay at."" Thus spoke Menaces O-Dog referring to Crenshaw Boulevard not so different from Presidents Vietnam and 70s Bronx and From Hells Whitechapel. In The Book of Eli the whole worlds a blasted ghetto. Its 31 years after the scorched-earth apocalypse. As in The Road The End has terminally desaturated the worlds palette. Only a few tattered product placements have managed to survive. On the road since Year Zero Denzel Washingtons Eli has become an expert at using his wickedly quick machete arm to ward off roving bands of highwaymen from his precious cargo the last copy of the Bible.The other copies have been destroyed as taboo since religious conflict inspired the nuclear holocaust. Thats not impossible to believe though it taxes credulity that a fragmented society that cant dig freshwater wells has managed to destroy every other copy of the most ubiquitous book in the Western world undoing all of the Gideons good work. As does the disciple Eli attracting Solara--a badly miscast Mila Kunis who looks like shes spending a semester abroad in the post-apocalypse from her fashion schools co-op program. As does Elis zoning out to his iPod during night watches in the hazardous wasteland (a twist-ending revelation makes this particularly ridiculous).Its water and a battery charge that lure Eli down the Main Street of a repopulated ghost town. The Hugheses play up the spaghetti-western element as Denzels Stranger strolls into a saloon owned by Gary Oldman the towns corroded lizard-like first citizen. Carnegie is one of the few survivors like Eli old enough to remember the lost world. His saloon is the lobby of the abandoned movie theater that he has made his headquarters. Accordingly hes interested in resurrecting lost forms of mass mind control--Oldman is introduced reading a biography of a great cinephile Mussolini. Its with cynical messianic intent that hes been scouring the countryside for a Good Book which sets up a showdown with true believer Eli.The Hugheses once had a black-comic sense to match their comic-book horror impulses (every line of Menace is a potential inside joke). Here that sense is evident only in a roadside stop-off with some unhinged survivalists an elderly American Gothic couple played by Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour. This opens into a firefight showing off the Hugheses other strength their allegiance to uselessly beautiful tracking shots here scuttling in and out of a besieged frame house as its shot to pieces. The rest of the rote splatter-violence has Denzel whirlwind lopping off heads through philistine hordes sequences only good for insight into what PS3 games the Hugheses were playing in pre-production (screenwriter Gary Whittas previous credits are aptly in video games).It remains to be seen how the clergy often overeager to accept tribute from popular culture will receive this gory simony. Nobody reads Pilgrims Progress anymore so I guess you take it where you can get it but The Book of Elis plastic parable isnt much more advanced than Insane Clown Posse theology. Eli eventually summarizes a lifetime of scriptural study as ""Do more for other people than you do for yourself""--an idea hardly unique to Christ--while an ending that combines Fahrenheit 451s Book People and Malcolm McDowell in an insupportable mustache seems to downplay the importance of Elis cargo.Eli himself resoundingly fails to follow the Good Samaritans example when witnessing a roadside hijacking; the most that can be said is that he remains chaste without visible effort. Our hero is mostly an Old Testament smiter of the wicked finally--unless I forget when Christ said ""You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back"" at the Garden of Gethsemane.

For the third time in four months after ""2012"" and ""The Road"" the end of the world as we now know it is up on the bigscreen in ""The Book of Eli."" An odyssey of a mysterious wanderer who has spent 30 years making his way across desolate post-apocalyptic landscapes in possession of the worlds only remaining Bible the Hughes Brothers first feature in nine years reps a weirdly intriguing mix of ""Mad Max"" ""The Postman"" ""Fahrenheit 451"" Leones ""Man With No Name"" trilogy and Graham Greenes novel ""The Power and the Glory"" all shot through with an unwavering religious impulse. In all likelihood this will not be one of star (and producer) Denzel Washingtons bigger grossers although if Warner Bros. cared to court the normally stay-at-home Christian audience it would hit a mother lode of positive response. By now the trappings of a CGI-enhanced ravaged future have become so familiar that perhaps they need to be given a rest; images of cities reduced to skyscraper skeletons familiar landmarks laid low broken highways littered with decaying cars and scattered survivors rummaging and fighting are no longer fresh putting the burden on filmmakers to come up with some new angles on prospective Earthly ruin. ""The Book of Eli"" with its enterprising journeyman and marauding cannibals at least initially looks like a futuristic samurai Western featuring a hero with quasi-supernatural (or as he would put it God-given) fighting abilities. After Eli (Washington) dispatches a bunch of snaggle-toothed cretins with a blinding display of blade work in the first action scene the lone survivor asks where hes going. ""West"" is his one-word reply which lands him in a fetid shell of a town that makes Deadwood look like Paris and is presided over by Carnegie (Gary Oldman) a man roughly Elis age whos first seen poring over a bio-graphy of Mussolini. One of the clever conceits of the script by first-timer Gary Whitta is that there are only a handful of people still alive who remember how things were ""before""; none of the younger generation knows how to read and the Bible specifically was singled out for destruction after the global cataclysm a vaguely described event that created ""a hole in the sky"" and was blamed by some on religion. In Carnegie lie the seeds of a great villain. Far smarter than the goons he bosses around hes an intellectual dictator frustrated by the miserable desert fiefdom he rules by virtue of his knowledge of a water source. For years hes been searching for a Bible himself knowing that if armed with exclusive possession of the Word he could attain unquestioned control although over what remains a puzzlement. Unfortunately Whitta and the Hughes Brothers (whose last film was ironically or not ""From Hell"") veer away from Carnegies brainy side to emphasize standard-issue cruelty and sadism missing an excellent opportunity to weigh humanitys potential for misuse of scripture against the goodness of its message. After Eli refuses Carnegies entreaties to give him the book and takes down a squad of his nastiest gorillas in the bargain the two become deadly enemies but not in the complex and complicit way they could have been. So the films core becomes a fairly standard chase across the wasteland as Carnegies raggedy troops in patched-together vehicles pursue Eli and the villains errant stepdaughter Solara (Mila Kunis) whos evidently the worlds last remaining hottie; with her and the Bible Eli would seem to have cornered the market in worthwhile rarities. Along the way the two briefly take refuge in an isolated house occupied by an old couple (Michael Gambon and Frances de la Tour) who serve proper tea in china and play music on a Victrola. The mild humor of this interlude suggests that some mordant comic touches would have been welcome throughout the pic which has a somber tone that suffers a bit from lack of modulation and nuance. Shooting in New Mexico with the Red digital camera system Allen and Albert Hughes favor slow lateral tracking shots and continually fill the big desert skies with clouds moving in the opposite direction as their hero. Color has been drained away to give the picture a parched sepia look and all hands on the craft and technical side have more than held up their end. The strange and varied electronic score by Atticus Ross Claudia Sarne and Leopold Ross is a welcome departure from the musical norm. Iconically effective as a single-minded messenger with a mission Washingtons Eli is ultimately too confined by the man-of-few-words movie norms hes saddled with. The feeling persists that the character and the picture could have been much more interesting had there been just one scene in which Eli upon arriving at Carnegies compound delights at finally finding a man he can talk with on equal terms. Carnegie for his part would share this pleasure during an evening of stimulating conversation all the while contemplating how best to snatch the King James from his new best friend. A little humanity and trust subsequently betrayed could have gone a long way. The prevailing approach forces Oldman to hit mostly obvious notes while Kunis looks awfully fashionable in her artfully assembled raggy outfits. As Carnegies blind wife Jennifer Beals mostly has to suffer at the hands of her abusive spouse. Without giving it away its safe to say that ""The Book of Eli"" ends less bleakly than ""The Road"" with a cheeky bit of geographic irony in fact.
