Daily Edition Login to download The Zone Film Review 644 PM PST 11/14/2011 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Less is less in another middling mumblecore outing. TWITTER Micro-budget filmmaker Joe Swanberg debuted his latest project at AFI Fest. Capping off his ""Full Moon"" trilogy of recent releases micro-budget filmmaker Joe Swanbergs The Zone world premiered at AFI Fest with little attendant fanfare concluding a cinematic dialogue with his actors and audience that began with Silver Bullets and Art History which debuted at Berlin earlier this year. Given Swanbergs well-established popularity with indie-leaning festivals The Zone and its Full Moon counterparts will continue to appear on the circuit for as long as he decides its advantageous to keep them in circulation. Plans to self-distribute on DVD through Factory 25 starting with fourth quarter 2011 as part of a limited edition subscription service rather than relying on usual partner IFC Films will avoid the risk of a disappointing theatrical release. Settling again into familiar tiresome introspective mode Swanberg plays himself as a filmmaker directing a trio of actors in a fraught relationship drama. Also depicting themselves are coupled twenty-somethings Larry (Lawrence Michael Levine) and Sophia (Sophia Takal) who share a tatty Brooklyn apartment with Kate (Kate Lyn Sheil) that they refer to as ""The Zone."" Joes no-budget film (a nod to Pasolinis Teorema) about a visitor (filmmaker Kentucker Audley) who seduces each of the three residents in quick and unconvincing succession is unraveling rent by jealousies among the intimate castmembers and his own self-doubts about his role as a filmmaker. The by now formulaic nested narrative structure yields little stylistic flair -- unless shooting a few scenes on a mobile phone can be considered imaginative -- with Swanberg relying on rudimentary lighting uninspired camerawork and rote editing pointlessly undercutting the otherwise serviceable hi-def format. All around the acting is naturalistic and unremarkable to the point of almost contradicting the concept of performance. Despite his own frequent self-absorption and offhand creative process Swanberg has forged a unique connection with his young Caucasian college-educated peers many of whom face lives of increasingly diminished expectations both in his films as well as in real life confronting a teetering economy and cratering job market. His direct depictions of youthful emotional turmoil casual nudity and wary semi-committed sexual activity are able to access a compelling authenticity few other contemporary filmmakers have been able to convincingly explore or replicate. Although collaborators may sometimes feel emotionally mistreated by is invasively inquisitive filmmaking style Swanbergs willingness to publicly critique his own creative process on camera is an uncommon approach that most filmmakers dont have the nerve to attempt. The laid-back low-fi productions comprising the Full Moon trilogy may seem almost deliberately provocative but actually represent the unwinding of a conversation that Swanberg has been having with himself and his audience throughout the series and indeed during much of his career. Whether anyone other than a small circle of friends fans and followers is still participating in his self-reflexive dialogue is questionable however. As a self-described ""art film"" director Swanberg has set the bar remarkably high compared to the resources and creative vision hes been prepared to deploy in his films thus far. In examining issues of art intimacy and desire The Zone reveals that Swanberg appears less convinced than ever of his own effectiveness as a filmmaker within the limitations of the mumblecore format.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 12 2010 Save for later Saved Journalist Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan left) questions Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) in the thriller Green Zone. Jasin Boland/Courtesy Universal Pictures/MCT/Newscom          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Despite its recent Oscar bonanza ""The Hurt Locker"" is in line with other Iraq-themed movies that have tanked at the box office including ""Stop-Loss"" ""In the Valley of Elah"" ""Body of Lies"" and ""Rendition."" Now along comes ""Green Zone"" starring Matt Damon and directed by Paul Greengrass who also made the last two ""Bourne"" movies. Action-packed to a fault its clearly intended to break the genres cycle of uncommerciality.Damon plays Army Chief Officer Roy Miller whose job it is to hunt down WMDs in the initial shock-and-awe stages of the Iraq invasion. Every location searched by his team draws a blank. When he confronts newly arrived Bush administration honcho Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) with his suspicions about faulty intelligence his concerns are pooh-poohed.Miller tracks the bad intel to Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) whose reports drawing exclusively on a confidential source named ""Magellan"" back the administrations convictions about the presence of weapons of mass destruction. Stonewalled on all sides refusing to be co-opted by Poundstone Miller improbably finds his only ally in Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) a burly veteran CIA operative at odds with Poundstone. Acting essentially as his own operative Miller tracks down the truth employing a small cadre of allies including a Saddam-loathing local Freddy (Khalid Abdalla). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Greengrass has made at least two politically themed movies in the past that transcended simple thrills ""United 93"" which dealt with the terrorist attacks on 9/11 and the Northern Ireland civil rights drama ""Bloody Sunday."" Both had a documentary-style immediacy that did not preclude political complexity. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Green Zone movie review But when Greengrass brought his edgy hand-held stylistics to the ""Bourne"" franchise I began to long for a stationary camera. When I go to the movies Im not paying to get seasick. In ""Green Zone"" the camera doesnt hold still even when the characters are rooted in place. Ive never understood why directors think all this hoo-ha is indicative of high realism. On the contrary its showoffy.""Green Zone"" offers itself up as more realistic more hard-hitting than the typical war movie. But Greengrass and his screenwriter Brian Helgeland attempting to provide bigger action and louder ka-booms engineer a series of increasingly improbable plot devices. Supposedly ""inspired by"" Washington Post reporter Rajiv Chandrasekarans scathing nonfiction book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" the film plays instead like a not terribly terrific ""Bourne"" movie that got sidetracked to Baghdad.While its bracing to have a big Hollywood movie confront the WMD fiasco ""Green Zone"" goes further than this in the end by in effect rewriting history. Its one thing for the filmmakers to (sort of) fictionalize real people - Poundstone is obviously based on Paul Bremer and Dayne on The New York Timess Judith Miller - but ""Green Zone"" wraps up with a wish-fulfillment fantasy that is about as believable as watching reinforcements riding in to save Custer. Ironically the film becomes an unintended and tragic reminder of what didnt ensue.

The only consolation is that the movie is inspired by a work of journalism Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone. Set in Iraq in the months following the 2003 invasion the film reunites the director and star of The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon; this time however we already know the details of the underhanded government action our hero confronts. Damon plays an army warrant officer whose WMD sorties keep coming up empty; unwilling to roll over hes soon embroiled in a turf war between the CIA and the Pentagon (personified by conscientious Brendan Gleeson and oleaginous Greg Kinnear) while attempting to wrangle a Baathist general (Igal Naor) a useful veteran (Said Faraj) and a useless embedded reporter (Amy Ryan) against a backdrop of more-or-less real events.Greengrasss approach to real-life disaster is far more simplified and pumped up here than it was in United 93 or Bloody Sunday but theres much to be said for his Bourne in Baghdad approach. The action is robust the politics simplified but strident insisting that a wilfully under-prepped war worked against both US and Iraqi interests. By shifting focus from the naively doctrinaire civilians of Chandrasekarans book to street-level soldiers questioning authority Greengrass concocts a formula with a fighting chance of dispelling the Curse of the Hollywood Iraq Movie. If a picture as conventionally accessible as Green Zone tanks that campaign is surely lost.

All pointless feeling guilty after the event film. Evene the action didn`t grab me as much as the previous Bourne films.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Green Zone amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Remember Me Greenberg >> Green Zone Immediately we know Paul Greengrass Iraq War film is a period piece Matt Damon still thinks WMDs exist. Its four weeks into the invasion and Damons idealistic squad leader has just been smacked down at a debriefing for suggesting that their intel is bunk. Day after dusty desert day he risks his mens lives for chemical factories that turn out to be long-abandoned warehouses caked in years of pigeon poop. History will prove Damon right but first hes got to survive today. If youre comfortable buying screenwriter Brian Helgelands premise that in 24 hours Damon can sleuth the who/what/why of the WMD debacle Green Zone is as smart of a thriller as youre going to see on the Iraq War. (At least until 2060 when an as-yet-unborn Quentin Tarantino will make his War on Terror Inglourious Basterds.) Inspired by former Washington Post Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekarans first-hand account Imperial Life in the Emerald City Green Zone distills--not simplifies--the clashing forces that dashed our chance of peace. (If in fact peace was ever even on the table.) Greg Kinnear plays the government smooth talker who tells journalist Amy Ryan and U.S.-installed Iraqi President Raad Rawi what they want to hear. Brendan Gleeson is the grumbling spook who foresees disaster. Meanwhile the Jack of Clubs Yigal Naor and his cronies have just been gracelessly deposed from power and are plotting their next move. Greengrass is economical in his scenes; the film bolts forward like a greyhound chasing a lure. Ill never love his shaky cam action fights--theyre a waste of skillful stunts--but tonally they fit better in this true life chaotic world than The Bourne Inanity which for all its posture is just a glum caper. Green Zone is richer than Jason Bournes sweaty quest; though its a compressed fiction its fair. Unlike GWBs ""With us or against us"" bluster this doesnt pretend that people are either good or bad. Everyone--even Naors deadly general--is self-righteously following their conscience. And consciences have consequences.

Film Friday Long on action short on reality Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Green Zone Directed by Paul Greengrass Written by Brian Helgeland Starring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear Classification 14A With Oscar champ The Hurt Locker about to return to theatres there will now be two Iraq movies at the multiplex for your comparison. For all the questions about the military veracity of The Hurt Locker it must be a model of procedural rectitude compared to Green Zone a truly bizarre mash-up of real history and political thriller. Green Zone which reunites director Paul Greengrass and star Matt Damon from the last two Bourne movies tries to tap into outrage about the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 for commercial movie thrills. Based on the plausible premise that the Bush administration lied or at best manipulated intelligence about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction as a pretext for the invasion the film reshuffles familiar events and characters into a Bourne-style conspiracy thriller. Matt Damon plays Ray Miller an army warrant officer in charge of finding WMDs in the months following the invasion. Each WMD site that Miller and his squad visit turns up empty and while they dodge snipers and fend off crowds of Iraqis that press around their jeeps theyre beginning to think theyre risking their lives for no reason. Miller starts to question the mission asking impertinent questions during briefings. He also confronts the chief administrator Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear modelled on Paul Bremer the U.S. administrator of Iraq) whos ruling Iraq from the safety of the ""Green Zone"" around the imperial palace. Kinnears character is the chief villain here working under pressure from the Bush administration and in league with a special-forces hitman (Jason Isaacs). Poundstone is also preparing to disband the Iraq army a decision that causes veteran CIA operative and Millers covert allyMartin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) to predict a civil bloodbath. Miller also meets a Wall Street Journal reporter (Amy Ryan standing in for New York Times reporter Judith Miller) who has been unwittingly feeding administration lies to her readers. Finally operating on a tip from an informant Freddy (Khalid Abdalla) Miller raids a house where deposed Baathist bigwigs are meeting and nearly captures a fictional General Al Rawi (Igal Naor) a supposed expert in Iraqi WMDs. Soon Miller and Poundstones special ops are going head to head. Little here makes any logical sense. Miller violates every imaginable military rule goes where he wants steals evidence and lies to get inside an Abu Ghraib-style jail to see a prisoner. Along the way the film reduces policies that caused the deaths of thousands to the equivalent of a first-person-shooter video game. Occasionally Greengrasss skills as an action director the handheld camera and frenetic editing make the unpalatable at least absorbing occasionally breathtaking. As well as his trademark handheld shots there are some startling vistas of Baghdad under attack. In the films most sustained action sequence - a fire fight at night - the blend of whirling shadows muzzle flashes and the thrum of helicopter rotors creates an experience thats simultaneously dizzying and claustrophobic like being strapped to a runaway car down a half-lit mine tunnel. The film has little to do with the sardonic non-fiction book on which it is based ( Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone by former Washington Post correspondent Rajiv Chandrasekaran). Screenwriter Brian Helgeland ( L.A. Confidential Mystic River) is the real culprit here creating a crude paint-by-numbers fiction that keeps yelling about the importance of the truth while hurtling in the opposite direction.

They are faint not quite translatable. They intensify as the screen remains black. Is that an air-raid siren? Then we arrive visually on the sorry end of the ""shock and awe"" bombing of Baghdad on March 19 2003. Directed by Paul Greengrass ""Green Zone"" begins exceedingly well. Then its fasten your seat belts swallow your Dramamine as the camera darts sways pans and tilts and were swept up in Chief Warrant Officer Roy Millers thwarted search for Saddam Husseins weapons of mass destruction. Miller steadily and sturdily played by Damon hits the ground running and gunning. Yet each time he arrives at a site confirmed by a Pentagon source known as Magellan he finds zip. ""Green Zone"" has a house-of-mirrors quality. Part of this is the genre but its also because the film takes on such recent events -- still unfolding really. The screenplay by Brian Helgeland was inspired by the former Washington Post Iraq bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekarans 2006 book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone."" It shouldnt be hard to spot the questionable wizard in the walled-off land of U.S. forces. Hes the Pentagons Clark Poundstone the guy in the suit with if not all the answers all of the bureaucratic muscle. As affable a performer as Greg Kinnear can be he is just as good at raising suspicions and hackles. When Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) asks to meet Magellan Poundstone stalls. Dayne has been writing Page 1 stories about Iraqs arsenal based on the inside dope from Magellan (shades of The New York Times Judith Miller?) Burly Brendan Gleeson portrays a CIA station chief and Poundstones understated nemesis. And Khalid Abdalla has some memorable moments as Iraqi translator Freddy. As played by Damon soldier Miller is a proxy we can believe in. Hes skeptical and ready to speak his mind in defense of his mission -- to locate Saddam Husseins cache of biological chemical and possibly pre-nuclear weapons -- but also in defense of broader American values. At a debriefing about the hunt for the hidden arsenals he brings up the obvious -- they got bubkis -- to the displeasure of his superiors. He repurposes his mission Find Magellan and learn what game hes playing. If we are to believe director Greengrass ""Green Zone"" is not a movie about the war in Iraq but instead as he demurs ""a thriller set in Iraq."" In the ""trust but verify"" department this doesnt quite hold up. Indeed ""Green Zone"" is a rather pedantic outing about the Bush administrations utilizing the fear of weapons of mass destruction to invade Iraq. The movies problem is a simple if distasteful one The filmmakers dont trust their audiences. They try to camouflage the meaning with the tools of the blockbuster trade breakneck cuts three-card-monte feints an insistent soundtrack. All of the rhythmic discipline that cinematographer Barry Ackroyd exhibited in ""The Hurt Locker"" he tosses for near-chaos here. Oh we get it. But ""Green Zone"" is not a documentary. And even the best of those -- Sebastian Junger and Tim Hetheringtons yet-to-be-released ""Restrepo"" -- offer us room to get our bearings. Damons the anchor a fine one at that but even he cant seem to hold the filmmakers attention for long. (But just in case were still confused about what we should feel John Powell provides a thriller-esque score). ""Green Zone"" hurtles then hurtles some more. Its destination? A shockingly wince-worthy sentence of geopolitical comeuppance. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpostcom/madmoviegoer ""green zone.""

Comments (1) Green Zone Video Rated R  115 minutes  2010 Director Paul Greengrass has applied his jumpy tumbling visual style to action blockbusters with Matt Damon (The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum) and serious dramatizations of political events (Bloody Sunday about the 1972 massacre of Irish protesters; United 93 about the passenger revolt aboard the ill-fated 9/11 flight). This Iraq war drama makes a game attempt to meld the two though manufacturing thrills takes precedence over any kind of journalistic insight. Damon plays a U.S. Army officer whos begun to realize his WMD intelligence reports are worthless; when a tip leading to Saddams top general gets swallowed up in a turf war between the CIA (aka Brendan Gleeson) and the Department of Defense (aka Greg Kinnear) Damon goes after the guy himself. Brian Helgelands script is ""inspired by"" Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction book Imperial Life in the Emerald City which is to say that both are set in post-invasion Iraq. By J.R.

But its spirit is rooted back in the early 70s when movies like The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor told us its not just OK to distrust your government its advisable. This was a golden age of paranoia in American film and society; with one big caveat When the truth-seeking protagonists think everyone is out to get them theyre usually right. Movie Information Green ZoneRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Paul GreengrassActors Matt Damon Brendan Gleeson Greg Kinnear Amy Ryan Khalid Abdalla and Yigal NaorRun time 115 minutesMPAA rating R (language and violence)Synopsis Matt Damons Army officer goes rogue to try and stop a brewing conflict.More movies from GuideLive.comThe Green Zone rogue is U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) assigned the task of finding the infamous WMD that never showed. Tired of following faulty intelligence toward one dead end after another he draws the attention of a frustrated fellow skeptic gruff CIA agent Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) and a wary Pentagon suit (Greg Kinnear) who wants the punk kid to stop sniffing around and asking questions.The film is a fictionalized adaptation of Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction best-seller Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone a detailed look at American policy and strategy mishaps during the first year of the war. But its also a Paul Greengrass movie which means lots of breathless action captured by swooping darting handheld camera a la the last two Bourne chapters and United 93. Stay away if youre susceptible to motion sickness. If your tummy is good to go then buckle up and enjoy a ride that manages to mix cinema verite flourish with a sense of righteous anger. (Suffice it to say that if you think the initial occupation of Iraq went swimmingly you wont appreciate the films point of view.)This is Damon in Everyman mode the good soldier who smells something funny and balks at the party line. Miller encounters friends and foes but mostly confused and-or enraged parties with plenty at stake in the outcome of the occupation. A journalist (Amy Ryan) based on former New York Times reporter Judith Miller has swallowed the Pentagon line all the way and is desperate to validate her work by getting the identity of a powerful mystery source.An anti-Baathist Iraqi (Khalid Abdalla excellent here and in The Kite Runner and United 93) leads Miller and his men to one of Saddam Husseins generals (Yigal Naor who played Saddam in the Emmy-winning miniseries House of Saddam) an ambiguous figure who plays a prominent role in Millers quest.Two things keep Green Zone from becoming a great movie. The key action sequences may be gritty but theyre also a bit disorienting; its hard to tell where you are who youre chasing how you got there. And the lessons learned are too often served up with a heavy hand as if the filmmakers (or studio) didnt quite trust their material enough to let it speak for itself. Green Zone is a damning film but it has a habit of reminding you in very literal terms exactly what it seeks to damn.But this is still an urgent piece of work. Even after sitting on the shelf long past its completion Green Zone is remarkable in its nerve to take on very recent history with a harshly critical eye. Previous Iraq movies including In the Valley of Elah and the Oscar-winning Hurt Locker have done a fine job depicting the human consequences of war. Green Zone mixes these with a palpable and convincing distrust of institutions and power.Alice in Wonderland may be last weeks news but sometimes real-world events are enough to send you through the looking glass. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie Review No WMDs but still plenty of bang in Green Zone washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Green Zone Movie Review No WMDs but still plenty of bang in Green Zone Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 12 2010 Paul Greengrasss ""Green Zone"" a wartime thriller set in the early days of the Iraq conflict was inspired by the brilliant book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" by The Posts Rajiv Chandrasekaran but it depends on the book more for atmospherics than story. To properly capture the detailed reportage and dark comedy Chandrasekaran brought to bear on the Bush administrations attempts to let 1000 Young Republicans bloom in the Middle Eastern desert one would need the satiric genius of Stanley Kubrick. And hes not available. This StoryGreen Zone No WMDs but still plenty of bangWatch the trailerFind showtimes Instead we have Greengrass who with his ""Bourne"" movie star Matt Damon has crafted a jangly noisy compulsively restless thriller on a par with the ""Bourne"" movies shot through with political critique. Damon plays U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller who after the U.S. invasion in 2003 has been tasked with finding the weapons of mass destruction on which the war was predicated. After being sent to three locations and coming up short Miller begins to doubt the intelligence on which the missions were based; soon hes asking uncomfortable questions around the Coalition Provisional Authority which makes its headquarters in the district from which ""Green Zone"" takes its name. Its not necessary to be conversant with New York Times reporter Judith Miller the Pentagons Office of Special Plans discredited WMD source ""Curveball"" or wily Iraqi politician Ahmed Chalabi to enjoy ""Green Zone"" but it helps. Such background knowledge surely adds to the revisionist frisson of Roy Miller confronting their fictional analogs as he tries to get to the bottom of the phantom WMD. Although Damon has done outstanding character work recently in such films as ""The Informant"" and ""Invictus"" in ""Green Zone"" here he gruffly claims his due as macho leading man barking out orders to his adoring men and fixing interlocutors with a piercing sky-blue gaze before deciding whether to trust them. Invariably his instincts prove to be flawless sending Miller off the reservation and on a circuitous path through Baghdad streets and Baathist redoubts where hes convinced the truth lies. Although Greengrass is best known for the ""Bourne"" franchise hes also made such stunning films as ""Bloody Sunday"" and ""United 93"" and in its blend of action and polemic ""Green Zone"" proves to be a striking apotheosis to the themes and aesthetics that have characterized the filmmakers career. But it also shows up his limitations The jittery scattershot camerawork of Greengrasss longtime cinematographer Barry Ackroyd was used far more coherently in Kathryn Bigelows Oscar-winning ""The Hurt Locker"" and the constant blurry close-ups of computer screens and street-level scrums lose their power with each successive cut. Still theres no denying ""Green Zones"" propulsive energy and the tantalizing idea of Damon making everything all right as a brave morally infallible soldier. The irony of course is that this time his Bourne persona doesnt suffer from amnesia. Instead hes trying to save us from our own.  1/2 R. At area theaters.

Master director Paul Greengrass ""Green Zone"" reunites him with Matt Damon for whats essentially another Jason Bourne thriller that entertainingly -- if sometimes uneasily -- mixes fact and speculation in a way thats already raised the ire of some on the right as well as on the left. Damon is playing an Army chief warrant officer charged with finding weapons of mass destruction (WMD) shortly after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq. Only his unit -- like all of the other American soldiers -- finds nothing in any of the sites hes been ordered to search. Ignoring the chain of command Damons character decides to personally investigate why hes been given bad intelligence. Encounters with a fed-up CIA agent (Brendan Gleeson) and a naive reporter (Amy Ryan) lead him to suspect that a slimy Defense Department official (Greg Kinnear) cooked the WMD reports to support the Bush administrations decision to invade. This sends our hero in search of a Baathist general who supposedly told the official there were no WMD -- and offered to cut a deal with the US which instead dissolved the Iraqi army. Arguably the most expert action director working today Greengrass offers a series of pulse-pounding chases as Damon pursues the general. All the while he is being chased by a Special Forces unit which has orders to take Damon out before he exposes the truth. The first Iraq war movie to hit theaters after ""The Hurt Locker"" won the Best Picture Oscar certainly doesnt soft-pedal its liberal politics the way that movie does. My colleague Kyle Smith writing an opinion column in The Post earlier this week condemned ""Green Zone"" as a ""slander"" against America. With all due respect the politics of this US-UK-French co-production distributed by Universal (whose parent company is the major defense contractor GE) are as incoherent as ""The Kingdom"" a right-leaning war fantasy released by the same studio in 2007. From a liberal point of view the Brian Helgeland script ""inspired"" by a nonfiction book wimps out by failing to name real names quite possibly because of legal considerations. Ryans character who writes for the Wall Street Journal is a thinly disguised version of controversial New York Times reporter Judith Miller while Kinnear is clearly based on Paul Bremer the American official charged with reorganizing the Iraqi government. I dont think any of this is going to matter to most audiences. Greengrass who also directed the superb docudrama ""United 93"" effectively employs US veterans to play soldiers in the exciting action sequences some of the best of their kind since ""Black Hawk Down."" Politics aside and purely as a piece of genre moviemaking ""Green Zone"" is a solid example of a political paranoia thriller. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Hall of Famer Father Murphy Merlin Olsen dies Read Next Hall of Famer Father Murphy Merlin Olsen dies Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 15006 How Hillary blew her big moment 8542 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 6130 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Kapow The presidential palace is crumbling the henchmen are fleeing and a black notebook is significantly tucked into the inside jacket pocket of a mustachioed man with ominous black eyes a man who is not Saddam Hussein but by the looks of it works for him. Thus begins Green Zone director Paul Greengrasss Bourne Identity-meets-Iraq-documentary thriller. For two hours it does not let go.The movie is ""inspired"" as the credits tell us by Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City an observant meticulous and darkly humorous account of the first year of the occupation. The genius of the book is in the details--the overlooked truths that add up to an incisive portrait--but the movies fantasy plot dispatches with them right away. Chief warrant officer Roy Miller (the unflappable Matt Damon) has to uncover (against the clock of course) the mystery behind the missing weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Is bad intel preventing Miller from finding them? Or did sinister people in Washington lie about the WMD in the first place? In Greengrasss world only one man can answer that question.And here precisely is where the film comes undone. What Chandrasekaran did so well--tenaciously cataloging the colossal morass of Americas small and not-so-small mistakes--Greengrass eschews for the popcorn-crunching conventions of a Hollywood potboiler. (Only Matt Damon can save the world And he has less than two hours to do it) Chandrasekaran captures the Coalition Provisional Authoritys culture of incompetence arrogance and misplaced idealism; Greengrass reduces it to an ego-fueled catfight between the heroic and brawny Miller and his glib and wily nemesis a bespectacled Pentagon lackey played by Greg Kinnear. If only it were that simple. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The veracity of recent war films is a new subgenre of film criticism. Commentators condemned this years best-picture Oscar winner The Hurt Locker for getting enough small details wrong to undermine the larger truths of the war. I did not agree. I saw The Hurt Locker four years after I left Baghdad and it brought me back in a flash in a way that no other Iraq movie had. Still for arguments sake I kept a mental verisimilitude checklist while watching Green Zone Baghdads dusty pallor--check; wraparound shades ""Hooahs"" and cursing--all good; Bush-Cheney campaign posters plastered on the walls of the Republican Palace--OK we get it. But Dominos pizza poolside? Not in 2003. Girls in bikinis with assault rifles slung on their shoulders? Doubtful. Wait how are they getting such good indoor reception on their satellite phones? I remember precariously dangling off the balcony of my hotel room for a signal. And then someone hotwires a car to ambush a secret Baathist meeting. Definitely not.In the end though it is not the details that do this film in; its the setup. Greengrass shows us very well that it was stupid to allow the looting that de-Baathification and dismantling the Army were bad ideas and that all of it led to the insurgency. But then he tells us that we still might have accomplished the mission had one man--one rogue truth-seeking officer--tracked down a little black notebook whisked away by a Saddam loyalist. In other words Paul Greengrass compresses the complexity so painstakingly assembled by Chandrasekaran into one notebook that contains one secret that reveals the one important source that only one journalist discovered after speaking to one evil administration official. But in the real Iraq there were many secrets many heroes many villains and accomplices (witting and unwitting) and plenty of good and bad journalism.If Green Zone were an exercise in bubble-gum pop I would have chewed happily. But it is Greengrasss insistence on making the thing look and feel authentic that made it all the more unbelievable. The movies shaky camera style creates a gonzo-documentary effect that seems to be there to convey authenticity. And the frenetic roller-coaster pace and videogame quality did echo the television coverage of the invasion. But it obscured the post-invasion feel of the place. What I remember of Baghdad in that era is heat and lethargy; terrifying stillness; great gaping silences when you could hear the palm trees bending under the weight of a wind thick with sand and smoke. I remember concertina wire and cinder blocks and emptied streets. Those streets often felt like a movie set but this movie did not make me feel the streets. There was no stillness in Greengrasss Iraq and I felt more nauseous after two seismic hours of Green Zone than I did after two years living in Baghdad.In the end the film felt like a stylized revenge fantasy--a poor mans Inglourious Basterds. (Basterds of course was a total fantasy; Green Zone blocks any real catharsis by blurring the line between fact and fiction.) But Greengrass gives a good wagging (and occasionally middle) finger to the people who led us into this mess doing what so many of us who were there wanted to do back then back when fallen soldiers were not shown on television and most people in America believed what the administration told them that the war in Iraq was a ""reconstruction effort"" and that democracy was on the march only maybe it had stubbed its toe.In the foreword to the tie-in paperback Greengrass writes that he wanted Green Zone to be ""a movie that would hopefully take some of the huge audience that had enjoyed the Bourne series to a real-world setting and encourage them to consider whether the mistrust and paranoia that characterized Bournes world was so far-fetched after all."" And that is what Greengrass did. Given how Green Zone unfolded Matt Damon might very well have found in his hip a chip that would lead him to a numbered bank account in Diwaniyah containing the secrets of the war. But that was not how the real war unfolded nor how it will be brought to an end. Green Zone has two movies competing for our attention. One might have been a memorable film about what went wrong in Iraq; the other is disposable. Ozernoy spent two years in Iraq covering the war for US News and World Report.

Matt Damon and director Paul Greengrass deliver their answer in Green Zone taking a nonfiction book Imperial Life in the Emerald City by former Washington Post Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekaran and turning it into a Bourne movie.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Nothing wrong with an ace action thriller. But the book set after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 was more than that. Chandrasekaran reported brilliantly on life in the Green Zone as the Pentagons Paul Bremer (head of the Coalition Provisional Authority) holed up in Saddams lush former palace and orchestrated the hunt for phantom WMDs. These facts are in the film adapted by Brian Helgeland (Mystic River) but mostly as background with names changed to protect the guilty (a terrific Greg Kinnear plays the Bremer-like Clark Poundstone). Brendan Gleeson breathes fire and ice as the CIA honcho who adds his own layers of muddle. Its up to a reporter (Amy Ryan outstanding as usual) to dig out the dispassionate truth. Which leaves Damons warrant officer Roy Miller to represent the human element. Miller a fictional invention is a stand-in for those who believe we occupied Iraq to find weapons and save lives. Millers wake-up call is meant to be ours. Too little and too late? Maybe. But even in this Bourne Zone Damon and Greengrass havent shirked their duty to enlighten and entertain.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Green Zone Drama. Starring Matt Damon Brendan Gleeson Greg Kinnear and Amy Ryan. Directed by Paul Greengrass. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Director Paul Greengrass is working his way through recent American history but its giving him a bad case of the shakes. His latest ""Green Zone"" which dramatizes how bureaucratic arrogance and stupidity ended up pouring gasoline on the Iraq insurgency is watchable in spite of Greengrass as much as because of him. The story is good enough to make viewers want to ignore the photography. He begins by showing us the start of the war the ""shock and awe"" air offensive as experienced from the ground. Just imagine the license such a scene might give to a director who wants to shake the camera. This is followed by an assault by American troops under sniper fire at a building thought to hold weapons of mass destruction. Of course theres nothing there and from the bird droppings its clear there hasnt been anything there for a decade. Its a tribute to Matt Damons special quality as an actor - not his star wattage but his ability to project a certain simple human decency - that we care about him even when we only see the side of his head the back of his head and the stray glimpse of his head bobbing into and out of the frame. In the first 10 minutes of ""Green Zone"" it becomes exhausting (for some it will be dizzying) trying to penetrate the loony camera work just to locate the actors and the story.

As a chief warrant officer leading men into lethal street battles over worthless empty sights Damon is smart enough to know that the bad intelligence cant be random. The intelligence has been cooked. His effort to find out whats behind the mess gives him a ringside seat to the turf battles between savvy Middle East experts and administration-appointed dilettantes whod be challenged running a bowling alley much less a country. The film is based on Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone."" From this screenwriter Brian Helgeland (""Mystic River"") fashions a fictional story but with characters based on either real people or recognizable types The duped journalist (Amy Ryan). The crony (Greg Kinnear) brought in to run the show. And the career intelligence officer (Brendan Gleeson) who knows that these ignoramuses and lightweights are about to create a disaster. Kinnear is best known for playing engaging likable characters but theres something especially satisfying about seeing him as a villain here if only because the kind of villain he plays is so common in the world and yet so underrepresented in art. Hes the man on a small scale who will do evil and yet never admit it to himself and create catastrophe and never feel responsible. Hes the man whose entire life and manner are based on a fundamental confusion between geniality and morality. Even if you catch a guy like this and bring him up on war crimes hed only be confused. Hed say ""Wait Im a nice guy"" Fortunately for Kinnear if he really were that man he couldnt play him so well. The challenge facing the filmmakers with ""Green Zone"" is that the audience knows how the real history played out The cronies triumphed and within months plunged the country into chaos. Still within those limits Greengrass and Helgeland squeeze out a convincing narrative one thats gripping and suspenseful and keeps us worrying about Damon - and thinking about all the other soldiers shafted by bureaucrats. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and violence.

Director Jim Sheridans ""Brothers"" with Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman lasted a minute in theaters. Even this years multiple-Oscar winner director Kathryn Bigelows fearlessly intense ""The Hurt Locker"" mustered only 14.7 million during its domestic release.Given this lackluster showing could the reunion of director Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon a powerhouse team that set the box office afire with two ""Bourne"" movies buck the Iraq war-movie jinx?Maybe just maybe. Even though ""Green Zone"" -- about a soldiers dawning realization that theres more going on than a wild-goose chase for weapons of mass destruction -- is mostly a success it does stray onto a few land mines. Where it succeeds best is as a breathless action thriller; where it falters is as a scathing indictment of Americas Iraq war policy especially when its characters speak like political pundits. That heavy-handed approach mars the film especially near its climax. Regardless of your political leanings -- and this movie will divide audiences based on how proudly they display their ideological stripes -- theres no denying that ""Green Zone"" makes you feel like youre wandering the streets of Iraq after the war breaks out.Advertisement Yet the purportedly urgent message ""Zone"" strives to convey about faulty WMD intelligence and governmental deception comes across like yesterdays news although some hairpin plot turns are shocking. If ""Zone"" had been released two years ago it would have had more punch. As a high-adrenaline action picture ""Zone"" delivers ""Bourne""-like sweaty-palm thrills via the herky-jerky camera work and lightning-fast edits Greengrass is known for. Here even more so than in the ""Bourne"" films all that tilt-a-whirl camera craziness seems appropriate if a bit nauseating at times. It serves the movie best when Greengrass authentically re-creates chaos on the battle-scarred streets and dangerous dark alleys that Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Damon) eventually inhabits.Greengrass loosely plumbs former Washington Post journalist and Moraga resident Rajiv Chandrasekarans sensational expose ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" which details the bungled attempts by U.S. officials to help rebuild Iraq. ""Zone"" includes some of the books details but presents a fictional lead in Miller.The idealistic officer realizes hes chasing down nonexistent WMDs and itches to get to the crux of matters. Soon he becomes ensnarled in a cover-up that draws into its web an unfortunate reporter (""Gone Baby Gones"" versatile Amy Ryan who gets scant screen time); a slick intelligence agent (an appropriately slimy Greg Kinnear); a no-nonsense CIA official (a fittingly outraged Brendan Gleeson); and a disabled Iraqi (a soulful Khalid Abdalla who leaves the best impression).But the film rests on Damons broad shoulders. He is such a likable screen presence that when his character gets socked in the face you want to leap out of your chair and scream ""You cant do that to Matt""You also hand him a hall pass whenever screenwriter Brian Helgeland (""L.A. Confidential"") saddles him and Abdalla with some clunky and ham-fisted dialogue.For these blustery reasons ""Green Zone"" is far from perfect.

"Green Zone Bourne-type action belies thoughtful look at war | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGreen Zone Bourne-type action belies thoughtful look at warThe intention of the latest film from Paul Greengrass is to thoroughly illustrate and excoriate the American decision to pursue war in Iraq based on the flimsy evidence. Mission accomplished.Matt Damon trades spy tools for a big gun and teams up with his Bourne director for a close-up look at the horrors of war.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 12 2010 Starring Matt Damon Greg Kinnear Brendan Gleeson and Amy Ryan.If the vertigo doesnt get you in Green Zone the paranoia just might.Paul Greengrass moves the camera like a dog gnawing on a bone in this Iraq War thriller creating disorientation that some viewers might find intolerable. But what the director and his favourite accomplice Matt Damon really hope to do is shake up anybody who still holds Pollyanna views about Americas unhappy meddling in Middle East affairs.""Dont be naive"" major characters take turns telling each other and thats also the films defining sentiment. Green Zone has an attitude - it persuades in almost documentary style that the war was sold on false pretences but no ones motives in this tangled affair can be completely trusted. Neither hawks nor doves can take comfort in the story. In this way the movie suggests that Iraq War films have come of age much like their Vietnam predecessors.Article Continued Below In the decade spanning John Waynes brute jingoism in The Green Berets (1968) to the deep regrets of Coming Home (1978) Americans shifted and sharpened their attitudes toward the Southeast Asian conflict. Films like Green Zone and Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker take a much deeper look at all aspects of the Iraq battle than weve seen in earlier treatments.Greengrass is part journalist and part action filmmaker switching between docudramas such as United 93 to commercial blockbusters like the two Jason Bourne movies hes made with Damon. Both sides of Greengrasss personality are on display in Green Zone which many people will understandably think of as ""Bourne goes to Baghdad"" especially in the films more explosive second half.First and foremost though the intention is to thoroughly illustrate and excoriate the American decision to pursue a war based on the flimsy evidence. The film opens with an effectively staged recreation of the ""shock and awe"" aerial bombings of Baghdad that began the Iraq conflict in March 2003 a time when most people professed to believe the Bush Administrations contention that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was concealing weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) that he intended to use.One of the believers is Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Damon) a U.S. Army stalwart tasked with rooting out and destroying WMD sites. This seems an almost comical job viewed through the 20/20 lens of history but Miller is convinced that the ""intel"" on the WMDs is reliable and he intends to follow orders no matter what the risk. He and his men stage commando-style raids on supposed WMD hideouts.When bust after bust comes up snake eyes - they break into a toilet factory at one point - Miller starts becoming disillusioned about his work and suspicious of the reasons for it. His eyebrow rises further after a cynical colleague tells him it doesnt matter whether the WMDS are real or not because the brass back in Washington doesnt require truth ""All theyre interested in is finding something they can hold up on CNN.""Miller isnt alone in his doubts. Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) has similar suspicions and so does CIA operative Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) who has been in the Middle East long enough to know that not all of Saddams men supported the deposed leader. Brown believes key members of Saddams Republican Guard must be conscripted to assist in the rebuilding efforts or else Iraq will quickly dissolve into anarchy. At the very least the Americans will quickly lose the faith of the Iraqi people if they blunder into the country without some knowledge of how it works - and theres certainly been no shortage of blunders.To underline these points and to advance the plot we see a secret meeting with Iraqi renegades - including a top Saddam general - discussing whether to cut a deal with the Americans or to launch an insurgency movement against them.Much of this is informed by knowledge of how things actually turned out which makes Miller and his fellow travellers seem a little too prescient to be believed. But Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland who has freely adapted Washington Post reporter Rajiv Chandrasekarans book Imperial Life in the Emerald City arent seeking to make the angels and demons too obvious.Greg Kinnears Pentagon apparatchik Clark Poundstone is the most obvious villain of the piece since hes pursuing the official line and attempting to thwart Millers quest for the truth. Yet he seems to sincerely believe that the WMDs are out there and its only a matter of time before they are unearthed and that President Bushs ill-advised declaration of ""mission accomplished"" will be vindicated. Poundstones answer for all the screw-ups? ""Democracy is messy.""We also meet an Iraqi collaborator (Khalid Abdalla) who is perhaps too eager to help Miller in his quest for the truth. Or maybe we should believe him when he insists ""I want to help my country.""Damon acquits himself beautifully as Miller convincingly playing a righteous Army renegade - he seems to have lowered his voice an octave to punch home his words.Its only when Green Zone devolves into straight Bourne kinetics in the latter going that the film starts to seem less thoughtful and more commercial. Yet it still manages to drive home Millers essential truth ""The reasons we go to war always matter.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Universal Studios By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 12 2010 1201 a.m. ET During the exciting turbulent and eventually wayward course of ""Green Zone"" Jason Bourne discovers the truth about weapons of mass destruction then teaches an errant reporter from The Wall Street Journal how to be a good journalist. In the interests of good journalism it should be said that this new film is a Jason Bourne thriller in spirit and sometimes in form but not in fact--the character played by Matt Damon Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller is an ostensibly ordinary soldier trying to do his duty. And it should be emphasized that the director Paul Greengrass and his cinematographer Barry Ackroyd (who also shot ""The Hurt Locker"") have achieved a surpassing sense of reality in the physical production. This is closer to what the war in Iraq and the fog of war in Baghdad must have looked like than anything previously captured in a fiction film. Mr. Greengrass and his star have collaborated before of course with fairly spectacular results--""The Bourne Ultimatum"" in 2007 and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" three years earlier. The difference this time starts with the source material. Instead of an extravagantly stylish adaptation of a Robert Ludlum novel the director was working from an overheated script by Brian Helgeland that claims--for no reasons evident on screen--to have been inspired by a work of nonfiction Rajiv Chandrasekarans excellent ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone."" Miller suspecting that Saddam Husseins WMDs dont exist goes off on his own--""off reservation"" in military parlance--as a one-man truth squad bent on finding out whos been lying to whom. For a while ""Green Zone"" generates genuine excitement as well as plenty of provocation--a fatuous surrogate for Ahmed Chalabi a pervasive scorn for American planning--but then goes off its own reservation into a wont-fly zone of awkward preachments and hapless absurdities. Some of the latter involve the Journals role in reporting the war. A fictional reporter for this paper Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) has taken Bush administration proconsuls at their word. Weapons of mass destruction exist she insists in her stories because highly placed U.S. government sources have been told they do by a highly placed Iraqi government source identified only as Magellan. Miller learns otherwise by tracking down Magellan on his own. The Iraqi a high-ranking general in Saddams army has told the Americans that the WMDs were a fiction from the very start but a double-crossing American intermediary played by Greg Kinnear has lied to Washington as well as to the Baghdad press corps. ""How could someone like you write something like this that isnt true?"" Miller demands of poor Lawrie who confesses to a cardinal sin--she never even tried to contact Magellan--but finally redeems herself by putting the real story out after Miller gives her a dossier of facts on which she can base it. (""Lets get it right this time"" the chief warrant officer says encouragingly.) Still doesnt that ring a distant bell a female reporter for a U.S. newspaper who dutifully promulgated the Bush administrations line on WMDs? Yes but the paper wasnt The Wall Street Journal it was the New York Times. On this subject like so many others ""Green Zone"" weakens its claim to authenticity with fictional fudgings. And the weakening works both ways. In a movie being marketed as an action adventure and nothing more a penchant for speechifying--""Do you have any idea what weve done here?"" Miller asks. ""What happens the next time we want people to trust us?""--pollutes the wellspring of the genre which is action unencumbered by real-world meaning. Mores the pity since so much of the craftsmanship in ""Green Zone"" is first-rate. Mr. Damon as usual takes charge of his character with understated yet formidable authority. (Miller is in charge of soldiers played by Iraq veterans who are re-enacting their real-life roles.) Mr. Kinnear is intriguingly devious as Poundstone the American intermediary. Igal Naor is impressively nuanced as Al Rawi the Iraqi general dubbed Magellan by the Americans. And the director Mr. Greengrass stages several action sequences--including Miller chasing Al Rawi through bombed-out Baghdad--that set your heart pounding while your brain defaults to a wait state of happy astonishment. Yet the film suffers from fuzzy areas that refuse to come into focus. Ms. Ryan seems uncomfortable in her thankless role. The usually superb Brendan Gleeson betrays no enthusiasm for playing Marty Brown a CIA man who has all the right answers but cant convince his own government. (""Dont be naive"" Marty tells Miller at one juncture even though Miller is preposterously prescient while a simon-pure operative from Central Intelligence is a case study in naivete.) And the more frenetic the action becomes the sillier it seems that Miller should be saving the U.S. from self-deception. ""The Hurt Locker"" stayed on the reservation by confining itself to suspenseful action and an investigation of a complex character. ""Green Zone"" comes on as Bourne again and ends up out of bounds. Mother An absolutely phenomenal film by the Korean director Bong Joon-ho ""Mother"" (in Korean with excellent English subtitles) begins and ends with dance. In the title sequence a woman whos neither young nor truly old gyrates mysteriously and abstractedly in the middle of a wheat field. In the coda she literally prods herself to join young revelers on a bus a half-seen presence in a surreal frieze. Between those two dances she travels on a journey of obsessive devotion to her 27-year-old son Do-joon a young man with an impaired brain--his buddy calls it a ""special head""--and the face of an angel. (Hes played affectingly though never sentimentally by Won Bin.) What a journey it is for the unnamed single mother and for us. For the sake of simplicity-- though nothing proves simple in the end not even Do-joons mind--lets say that the narrative operates on twin tracks. Its a story of maternal love thats the definition of unswerving and a whodunit thats set in motion when the cops throw Do-joon in jail after blaming him for the murder of a local girl whose battered body has been found hanging over a railing on a terrace high above the town. He had followed her for a while from a bar the night before and he admits it in his addled way but the flimsy case against him has all the earmarks of a classic setup. ENLARGE Kim Hye-ja is the steadfast title character in Bong Joon-hos Mother. Magnolia Films If this sounds dramatic it surely is and all the more so when Do-joons mother decides to find the killer. But the filmmaker Mr. Bong wont be jailed by a single tone or style. By turns the story is comical (in another time and country the bumbling detective that the mother becomes could have been played by Margaret Rutherford); satirical (the torpor that prevails in the police station the decadence of the lawyer and his female entourage); startling (a memory of his childhood that Do-joon recovers unbidden); and sometimes deeply shocking. (If I so much as hinted at why Id be giving away some of the best movie surprises Ive seen in years.) This is filmmaking of a high order. Mr. Bong whose previous features include ""Memories of Murder"" and a marvelous monster flick called ""The Host"" may toss off an occasional reference to a classic director of the past. (A couple of scenes with simultaneous action in the foreground and background evoke Jean Renoir.) His fondness for discovering the bizarre beneath the mundane makes him a soul mate of David Lynch. But hes a distinctive stylist in his own right. Ive never seen a director do what he does at the end of a scene with Do-joon in his cell--pull the camera slightly back rather than push it in for dramatic emphasis. And hes brilliant with actors though Kim Hye-jas performance in the title role may only be a case of his having hired a brilliant actress. Her character doesnt need a name. Shes a thoroughly specific and eccentric mother who does acupuncture without a license (one of my favorite lines is ""Theres a meridian point that can loosen the knots in your heart"") and shes every mother who has watched her child suffer. ""Mother"" has many points that can turn your heart inside out. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Bloody Sunday (2002) Before Paul Greengrass was drafted by Hollywood to direct Matt Damon in the Bourne films he did this remarkable re-creation of the day in September 1972 when 13 unarmed civilians were killed by British soldiers during a peace march in Northern Ireland. The bloodbath is still surrounded by controversy so the docudrama cant be taken as a definitive factual account. Yet it makes a powerful case for the contention that 3000 British paratroopers sent to keep the peace were looking for a fight when they arrived and that their contingency plan was only a sequence of ghastly blunders waiting to happen. ENLARGE The Fog of War (2003) The late Robert S. McNamara who was secretary of defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson during Vietnam spoke straight to the camera at the age of 85 in Errol Morriss haunting troubling documentary. McNamaras mind was clear just as it was way back then but his conscience was cloudy. He could not or would not bring himself to say he felt guilty about staying in office during Vietnam even though he admitted indeed insisted that Washington misconstrued the nature of the conflict We saw it as an element of the Cold War he observes the Vietnamese saw it as a struggle for their independence. ENLARGE The Deep End (2001) A beguiling surface calm and a bottomless sense of dread coexist in this thriller with a quietly sensational performance by Tilda Swinton. She plays Margaret Hall an essentially single mother whos used to doing whatever needs to be done for her three kids. The depth of her devotion becomes apparent only after the body of her older sons gay lover washes up on the beach in front of her lakefront house. With hardly a moments hesitation Margaret goes off the deep end herself plunging into a perilous world she can neither foresee nor control. The directors were Scott McGehee and David Siegel.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Thursday March 11 2010 339 PM Title Green Zone The standard gripe against Iraq War movies - ""The Hurt Locker"" notwithstanding - is that the conflict is too current to make for satisfying drama. If that complaint was ever true the taut ""Green Zone"" upends it by using one American soldier as a stand-in for all of us.That sounds like a heavy lift and it doesnt come without costs (and a bit of preachiness). But director Paul Greengrass - whose consistently nail-biting body of work includes ""The Bourne Supremacy"" ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and the underseen ""United 93"" - muscularizes the morality that was one of the sacrifices during the Iraq invasion and the newspaper headlines that followed. The result is intelligent tough and gripping.Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is a U.S. chief warrant officer deployed to Iraq in March 2003. As he and his team hit Baghdad locations where Army intel says WMDs are stored Miller finds only toilet factories and empty warehouses. His concerns are tabled when he brings them up to superiors.Turns out there is another voice in agreement growly CIA expert Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) who enlists Miller to find out if the source of the intel is a top Baathist general who deliberately spread misinformation. A weaselly bureaucrat from the Defense Department (Greg Kinnear) knows the sources identity and hes tight-lipped - except when he feeds hazy information to a Wall Street Journal reporter (Amy Ryan) who runs it without it being corroborated. Miller discovers the truth about the WMDs isnt what anyone -- the military the administration even the public -- wants to hear.The movie has a compelling visceral punch and a sly way of dealing with absurdities like top U.S. officials lolling poolside in Saddams palace after remaking it as the Pentagons Green Zone. (Brian Helgelands screenplay is inspired by Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City."") Using the hand-held camera style popularized in his and Damons ""Bourne"" movies Greengrass makes even talky scenes tense.The cast is strong and Damon is a dependable center for all this a classic American good guy wanting to know whats rotten and why. If the movie sometimes works in shorthand -- shifty Pentagon hawk lapdog journalist all-knowing CIA operative -- it plays the far-reaching complicity in the false reason for war as a kind of ""All the Presidents Men"" in khaki. Miller has no idea how high the lies go but he knows that on the ground Americans and Iraqis both are in the dark.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie Review Green Zone - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Movie Review Green ZoneDirector Paul Greengrass screenwriter Brian Helgeland and Matt Damon team on an action thriller that deals candidly with the invasion of Iraq and the failed search for weapons of mass destruction.March 12 2010|By KENNETH TURAN | Film Critic You have to hand it to ""Green Zone."" Made with daring and passion it attempts the impossible and comes remarkably close to pulling it off. So close in fact that the skill and audacity used the shock and awe of this highly entertaining attempt are more significant than the imperfect results. As created by director Paul Greengrass screenwriter Brian Helgeland and star Matt Damon this risk-taking endeavor uses the narrative skills and drive Greengrass honed beautifully on ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and marries them to reality-based political concerns. More specifically this is a red-hot action thriller that deals candidly and unapologetically with the situation in Iraq. Not todays Iraq but the country in early 2003 when the U.S. invaded and the search was on for WMD Saddam Husseins much-discussed weapons of mass destruction that were the key rationale for military action. ""It was a pivotal subject"" screenwriter Helgeland ( an Oscar winner for ""L.A. Confidential"") has said ""in why we went to war and how the war was sold."" To tell this story of idealism toyed with and betrayed of a superb soldier determined to find out the truth about those weapons Helgelands tightly written script has gone down parallel paths while taking great care not to let either story line overwhelm the other. On the one hand Helgeland has artfully constructed a roman A  clef in which numerous key real-life figures including New York Times reporter Judith Miller and Iraqi politician Achmed Chalabi have been given fictional counterparts. More than that the specifics of controversial decisions (for example ""Debaathification"" and the disbanding of the Iraqi army) taken from such journalistic accounts as Charles Fergusons documentary ""No End in Sight"" and the book credited with being an inspiration for the film Rajiv Chandrasekarans ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" have worked their way into the story. But it would be a mistake to consider ""Green Zone"" (named after the American enclave in central Baghdad) to be any kind of political tract. First and foremost it aims and succeeds at being the kind of entertainment fans of the ""Bourne"" films would appreciate. As director Greengrass writes in a foreword to a new ""Emerald City"" paperback he wanted to encourage that audience to ""consider whether the mistrust and paranoia that characterized Bournes world was so far-fetched after all."" As a filmmaker Greengrass showed as far back as his superb ""Bloody Sunday"" that he is one of the worlds best at re-creating reality-based chaos. Working with his usual team (cinematographer Barry Ackroyd production designer Dominic Watkins editor Christopher Rouse and visual effects supervisor Peter Chiang) the director conveys a fine sense of the mind-warping turmoil on the ground as well as the quicksilver landscape of shifting values alliances and loyalties that characterized the occupation. In this he is helped enormously by his ""Bourne"" star Matt Damon. Almost imperceptibly Damon is maturing into a formidable leading man always slightly different always completely believable an actor whose quiet strengths have begun to mirror his recent ""Invictus"" director Clint Eastwood. Damon plays U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller a superbly competent head of a team of soldiers risking their lives to find WMD. But despite raid after raid the weapons are nowhere to be found and Miller is good enough at his job to want to find out why his men are being put in harms way in the service of what appears to be bogus intelligence. Persistent despite the run-around he gets from his superiors Chief Miller comes to the attention of Martin Brown (a just-right Brendan Gleeson) the rumpled old CIA hand whos been in Baghdad since the Flood. Brown is the first person to give Miller a sense of the unreal counterintuitive world of Green Zone power politics where nothing is as it seems. When Miller tells the CIA man ""I thought we were all on the same side"" Brown caustically answers ""Dont be naive."" Among the other people Miller draws into his quest are Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) the compromised Judith Miller knockoff and Clark Poundstone a Defense Intelligence agent in sync with Washingtons party line about the good thats being done in Iraq. Hes played by Greg Kinnear an actor with something of the affect of the real-life L. Paul Bremer who was the head of the Coalition Provisional Authority. Helped by the pithy nature of Helgelands script and Greengrass hard-edged realistic directing style these performances are all excellent as are Khalid Abdalla as an Iraqi patriot Yigal Naor as an elusive Iraqi general and Jason Isaacs as a ruthless Special Forces operative. Even though it comes awfully close ""Green Zone"" cant totally keep its balance right up to the end. Precisely because so much of this film is so good at verisimilitude the Hollywood tendencies of its last sections are not as satisfying as whats come before the forceful and engaging nature of the action footage notwithstanding. Yet though we regret that final wobbliness ""Green Zone"" leaves us a great deal to be grateful for. It gives full weight to the moral complexities of the Iraq situation something that is rare in any film let alone a thriller and if it wears its heart on its sleeve its hard to argue with a film that insists ""the reasons we go to war always matter."" Can one man make a difference? this film asks. If his name is Paul Greengrass and he has this kind of team behind him the answer is yes. kenneth.turan latimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe intricate birth of The Bourne LegacyAugust 3 2012New on DVDJune 20 2010Critics Pick Green ZoneMarch 25 2010Green Zone An Iraq war movie with a Bourne feelFebruary 27 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentMatt DamonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-green-zone12-2010mar12,0,2700884.story",200,greenzone19,greenzone,latimes

Carlos Gonzalez Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With his urgent Jason Bourne movies and his documentary-style reconstruction of the 9/11 attack in ""United 93"" director Paul Greengrass has earned a reputation as one of our sturdiest action directors. In the Iraq war thriller ""Green Zone"" hes hyperactive pushing his guerrilla-style photography to a level of shock and awe that verges on the insufferable. Frenetic in execution and formulaic in substance the film leaves one lathered into a frenzy but not moved at once overwhelmed and undernourished. The film is set in 2003 immediately following the U.S. invasion of Iraq when few people were inclined to ask pointed questions about the Bush administrations rationale for the war. Weapons of mass destruction were in Saddams arsenal we were assured; our troops would find them in good time. Meanwhile U.S. envoys kick back with pizza and beer by the pool inside the secure Green Zone sector while Iraqis outside beg -- or riot -- for water. U.S. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) suspects something is rotten in Baghdad. After three dangerous raids turn up nothing more toxic than piles of pigeon droppings hes convinced theres a serious intel problem. When he says so at a mission briefing Miller draws the wrath of his superior officers and the attention of CIA station chief Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson). The spy taps Miller to shed his uniform and go ""off the reservation"" to locate a fugitive Baathist general who can unravel the WMD mystery. Thats right the CIA man is a good guy. The press represented by Wall Street Journal foreign correspondent Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) is a gullible dupe. So Brian Helgelands script isnt slavishly following the standard political thriller playbook. The main villain is familiar however. Greg Kinnear plays Clark Poundstone a slithery neo-con bureaucrat determined to dismantle Iraqi society and airlift in his own choice as the new leader. His henchman Lt. Col. Briggs (Jason Isaacs) doesnt hesitate to beat up Miller snatch his informants and launch ""kill not catch"" missions against Iraqi officials with embarrassing secrets. Jasin Boland/Universal Jason Isaacs and Matt Damon in ""Green Zone"" When Miller protests ""Arent we all on the same side?"" Brown counsels ""Dont be naive."" Dramatic license aside the film does a fair job of summing up the cooked intelligence reports credulous newsgathering and facts-be-damned official certitude that triggered our longest war. But the story is less concerned with connecting the dots than with firefights and perplex-o-vision editing. The term run-and-gun camerawork never was so apt. Watching the film is like being hit with a series of flash-bang distraction grenades. Too much flash not enough bang.

"Iraq war thriller Green Zone strays outside lines of history - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Iraq war thriller Green Zone strays outside lines of history Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Jonathan Olley Universal Pictures via AP Matt Damon plays a fictional warrant officer trying to track down weapons of mass destruction in the Paul Greengrass-directed film. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Green Zone  1/2 stars out of fourStars Matt Damon Greg Kinnear Brendan Gleeson Jason IsaacsDirector Paul GreengrassDistributor Universal PicturesRating R for violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Fact and fiction are woven with a sense of urgency in the unrelenting but flawed Iraq war thriller The Green Zone. INTERVIEW Damon on movies moving back to New York and that mustache If only there had been such a hero as Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller played by Matt Damon at the center of uncovering the fallacy of weapons of mass destruction. The premise of one honest patriot stumbling on the truth and informing the press is both wishful thinking and revisionist history. So is the idea that the WMD rationale was promulgated by a few midlevel government types. Granted this is not meant to be a documentary but it is based on Imperial Life in the Emerald City a non-fiction book by Washington Post journalist Rajiv Chandrasekaran that details the early days of the occupation of Iraq and the subsequent insurgency. Oddly the movie is being advertised as if it were a fourth Bourne film. The studios promotion makes some sense given the reuniting of Damon who played Jason Bourne and two-time Bourne director Paul Greengrass. The pair collaborated on 2004s The Bourne Supremacy and 2007s The Bourne Ultimatum. Their association worked superbly in those high-octane action films. But The Green Zone is not up to those standards. It takes a complex and important story and renders it facile. Characters are etched too clearly in black and white. Greg Kinnear as an icy Pentagon official in charge of the mission might as well be twirling a villains mustache. As a war thriller Zone works on a visceral level though Greengrass trademark jittery camera work hits new dizzying -- and occasionally off-putting -- notes. The story takes place in 2003. Miller is assigned to fruitless searches for weapons of mass destruction. At first he thinks hes gotten bad intelligence. Then he begins to see the truth. Screenwriter Brian Helgelands dialogue is predictable relying on such lines as ""The whole worlds watching"" and ""I just want to help my country."" But the film has an authentic gritty look. Some of the best scenes involve military vehicles clogging the ravaged streets set upon by desperate crowds of Iraqis begging for water. Damon is first-rate but Amy Ryans talents are wasted as a thinly drawn Wall Street Journal reporter the first to write bogus reports about non-existent weaponry (think The New York Times Judith Miller). One of the better performances is by Khalid Abdalla who plays an Iraqi shaken by what the U.S. invasion means to his country. ""Its not for you to decide what happens here"" he tells Damons Miller. Another key line uttered by Miller is ""Lets get the story right this time."" Its a worthy plea as is his righteous anger when he says ""It always matters why we go to war. Whats going to happen the next time we ask people to trust us?"" The film conveys the message that the U.S. government lied about the existence of weapons of mass destruction. While it might have felt provocative a few years ago Zone feels anticlimactic now. It also pales in comparison to Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker the most powerful film yet made about the Iraq war.

In Green Zone - Paul Greengrass frenetic Iraq war movie inspired in part by former Washington Post correspondent Rajiv Chandrasekarans Imperial Life in the Emerald City - urgent convoys roll through the city helicopters whip the hot Baghdad skies important Pentagon dudes deplane at Saddam International Airport and the good soldier portrayed by Matt Damon realizes that he his men and his country are being played for fools.In the wake of the Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker - a far better film and one with a less strident less obvious agenda - Green Zone arrives looking strangely anachronistic. In part this is because the film is set in early 2003 when the dust of the U.S.-led invasion was still whirring in the air. In part too its because so many Iraq movies - with their house-to-house sorties their wailing widows their bitter Baghdad citizenry - have preceded it.But the been-there/done-that feeling is mostly a function of Brian Helgelands desperately busy screenplay which tracks an intrepid Army officers fruitless quest to find weapons of mass destruction - the MacGuffin that was supposed to justify the war - and cuts and pastes sound bites from George W. Bush Dick Cheney and the neocons into the script. When Greg Kinnear as a Defense Department intelligence chief shrugs away the anarchy on the streets with a terse ""democracy is messy"" the irony gets lost in the history.And as Damon bringing his Bourne gravitas (and box office) to the role of Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller hustles from one empty dung-encrusted warehouse to the next he rattles off a mantra of disillusionment ""This is no WMD site"" ""The intel is wrong"" ""Did anyone verify this story?""This last question he asks of Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) a reporter whose articles about the existence of WMDs were sourced from the most high-up and anonymous parties. While Daynes Wall Street Journal byline is fictitious the New York Times Judith Millers was not. The standard disclaimer ""This is a work of fiction and bears no resemblance to people dead or alive . . . ""? Well right yeah sure.With the herky-jerky handheld camera work and hiccup editing that marked his action sequences in The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum director Greengrass cuts a chaotic swath through his make-believe Baghdad (the movie was shot in Morocco and Spain). Theres gripping suspenseful stuff here as Miller and his squad abandon the WMD hunt to chase down pro-Saddam conspirators and as an Iraqi citizen-turned-interpreter (Khalid Abdalla - one of the terrorists in Greengrass United 93) tags along limping hurriedly on his artificial limb. The grim sights of hooded prisoners of torture chambers and hired guns doing special forces dirty work on clandestine missions are contrasted with the country-club atmosphere inside the so-called Green Zone. Here behind checkpoints and fortifications the new corps of American diplomats bureaucrats and aides lolls poolside ready to turn Saddam Husseins capital into a beacon of democracy in the Arab world.Cut to Bushs ""mission accomplished"" broadcast.And cut to Damon glowering mightily as he trots through the Baghdad night trying to find the truth as intelligence guys and Pentagon guys and Army guys prevaricate all around him.""I thought we were all on the same side"" he says to Brendan Gleeson cast as the CIAs Baghdad station chief.""Dont be naive"" the CIA man says back.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + With the Oscar triumph of the Iraq war thriller ""The Hurt Locker fresh in our memories Paul Greengrasss ""Green Zone invites us back to the issue that started it all. Chief warrant officer Matt Damon races around Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction. Funny thing though Every time he gets to a designated site he and his men find nothing. Well once they turn up a toilet (whose political symbolism the movie leaves up to us). Otherwise every time its that Geraldo-Rivera-opening-Al-Capones-vault feeling.""Green Zone is somewhere between a blockbuster and a tract -- a traction movie. It whizzes and bangs and sizzles as it chases the truth like a dog off its leash. Brian Helgeland who adapted ""L.A. Confidential took the movie from Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction account of the first year of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone. Helgeland balances the American operatives who manufacture reality with the more marketable hunt for bad guys and WMD.The film feels in so many ways like one of those BBC miniseries like ""State of Play in which a fleet of characters are used as pawns in some larger narrative about the corrosive taint of a corrupt institution -- nearly always the government. But a restlessness keeps the movie both unsettled and uninteresting. Greengrass applies the same mix of visual elan and brute force that brought alive the second and third Jason Bourne movies and turned the solemnity of ""United 93 into a harrowingly physical affair.Brute force may be a liability for a political thriller based on current events. You want that sinking feeling that things are worse than they seem. That comes only from suspense. And this time Greengrasss approach doesnt allow for suspense or speculation. His editor chops the shots down to mere seconds while the cameras plow from one pile of rubble and debris to the next. Unlike the ""Bourne movies or Greengrasss first film the Northern Ireland docudrama ""Bloody Sunday ""Green Zone finds the director struggling to make the chases and shootouts navigable. Sometimes the dots of seconds-long images connect in an exciting way like action-movie pointillism. Theres a violent nighttime search for instance where all the mayhem and quick shots become clear. The physical stuff is achieved by amassing tiny details. The human bits are done in broad strokes.The plot to uncover whether there are WMDs and whos covering up answers involves a shady Karl Rove-style administration bureaucrat (Greg Kinnear) a CIA Middle East expert (Brendan Gleeson) a Wall Street Journal reporter (Amy Ryan) whos been writing WMD stories using a dubious source a la Judith Miller for The New York Times. Whenever Damon confronts Kinnear Kinnear looking severely clenched may as well be saying ""No Matt theres nothing behind that door at all. Why on earth would you think that? Its wrong to expect the pensive intimacy of ""The Hurt Locker from a Greengrass film. ""Green Zone moves too fast to think and its political ideas have been pre-argued to death. Both movies are about soldiers one much more persuasively than the other. Damons chief warrant officer smells a rat and heroically hunts it down. The movie would actually make a decent Bush-era double feature with Roman Polanskis much better ""The Ghost Writer which is focused on a former British prime minister based on Tony Blair. Do we already miss these two and the cabals they may or may not have been involved in?There remains a ""Dr. Strangelove-caliber farce to be made from Chandrasekarans book. Barring that Id take the ruthless vulgarity of ""In the Loop. Somewhat to their credit and despite Kinnears obviousness Helgeland and Greengrass dont find the Bush administrations chicanery a laughing matter. But theres a disjunction between the scripts seriousness and the sense of chaos that brings it to life.If tremulous 100-yard-dash camerawork is Greengrasss voice this sort of movie might not be the song for him. Helgelands script doesnt just suspect conspiracy. Its certain there is corruption. And righteousness doesnt suit the illusory objectivity of the directors docu-realism. The wild roving eye of ""Bloody Sunday ""United 93 and even his Bourne films is now a ranting I.Theres also the matter of timing. ""Green Zone takes us back to 2003 and the Bush administration overthrow of Saddam Hussein its dismantling of Iraqs military and the presidents ""mission accomplished speech. But it feels like a rehash of the books and documentaries that followed. The movie doesnt rethink the invasion. It just redistributes its lies and secrets across the government and military. The best scenes in the movie involve the meetings among the Iraqi factions trying to keep the country from collapsing into further chaos. Theyre too brief but they crackle with whats going on now. Not only is that sort of open-ended political action more up Greengrasss alley its a side of this story the movies arent telling.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 11 2010 629 PM Oh So Thats Where They Were Matt Damon goes looking for WMD in The Green Zone. By Dana Stevens Matt Damon in Green Zone As the camera jerked and joggled its way through an impossible-to-follow action sequence late in The Green Zone (Universal) I found myself thinking ""Damn Im sick of faux-documentary-style hand-held cinematography. This feels like ersatz Paul Greengrass at its worst."" Then I remembered The Green Zone is directed by Paul Greengrass. The man whose raw bare-bones style made the second two Bourne films such visceral action thrillers and who recreated the events of Sept. 11 2001 in the difficult-to-watch United 93 (a movie that made me morally queasy but that was undeniably well-crafted) has turned his attention to the early days of the Iraq war. The script was adapted by Brian Helgeland from a book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran Imperial Life in the Emerald City and it reimagines the events of the spring of 2003 in a way thats analogous to Quentin Tarantinos feverish rewriting of the Second World War in Inglourious Basterds. What if instead of all the awful shit that really historically happened some good guys had found a way to save the day? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Green Zones principal good guy is Roy Miller (Matt Damon) an Army warrant officer who as the movie opens has just conducted his third fruitless search for WMD based on top-secret military intelligence. At a meeting he dares to question the reliability of that intelligence which gets him in hot water with his superiors. Convinced that something fishy is afoot Miller leaves the field to poke around Baghdads protected ""green zone"" for answers. A CIA operative (Brendan Gleeson) hints that the Iraqi tipster known as ""Magellan"" may be a fabrication while a Rumsfeldian neocon from the Defense Department (Greg Kinnear) blandly assures Miller that its best not to look too closely into the reasons behind the war or the way its being waged ""Democracy is messy."" Advertisement Outside the borders of the green zone Miller encounters two Iraqis who are either trying to help him or leading him into a trap a civilian (Khalid Abdalla) who claims to have a map of insurgent ""safe houses"" and a general from the disbanded Iraqi army (Yigal Naor) whos been tagged by the Pentagon as a terrorist leader. Every so often Amy Ryan shows up as a credulous Wall Street Journal reporter duped by bad intelligence--a transparent stand-in for New York Times reporter Judith Miller. As an action-adventure thriller The Green Zone holds up fairly well despite a few significant plot holes and a rather large dollop of Greengrass trademark shaky-cam. Damon is likable in his squinty stolid Bourne mode and Brendan Gleeson is terrific as the Cassandra-like spy; he not only ably discards his Irish accent but invents a great American one a pinched nasal Midwestern twang. But the movie (which was shot two years ago and has been sitting on Universals shelf ever since) feels stale its anti-war message stuck in the mid-2000s. When we see Bush on a TV screen in the green zone declaring ""Mission accomplished"" on that aircraft carrier the irony lands with a thud. Havent we been sickened by the hypocrisy of that speech for the better part of a decade now? Of course the deceptions that occurred in the run-up to the war and the first weeks after the invasion are no less outrageous in 2010 than they were in 2003. But seven years into the Iraq quagmire we need more from our political filmmakers than an angry fist (and a hand-held camera) shaken in the Bush administrations direction. Damons conversations with Gleeson touch on a post-Iraq invasion story that had Greengrass taken the time with it would have made for a better movie the impact of the disastrous decision to dissolve the Iraqi army and police forces creating a huge underclass of unemployed and disgruntled men with a motive to rise up against the occupying forces. As documented in both Chandrasekarans book and Thomas Ricks remarkable Fiasco the factors that went into turning our mission in Iraq into such a nightmarish debacle were enormously complex. To suggest that a lone brave soldier could have set things right with a little amateur sleuthing seems like cinematic wish-fulfillment an insult both to the intelligence of viewers and to the troops who years after learning the truth about WMD in Iraq are still living with the consequences of the Bush administrations chicanery.

Share Tweet Though the last two entries in the Bourne franchise are as purely fictional as the first one director Paul Greengrass brought an uncanny realism to the franchise putting distance between Jason Bournes spy adventures and the more synthetic escapism of James Bond. With Green Zone Greengrass latest collaboration with Bourne star Matt Damon Greengrass makes a noble attempt to fuse the hard-hitting shaky-cam immediacy of his action movies with the scrupulous real-world politics of past docudramas like Bloody Sunday and United 93. As expected Greengrass smoothly integrates the suspense and tension of a Hollywood thriller with a ground-level depiction of American chicanery in the chaotic days after the fall of Baghdad. Yet for the first time in Greengrass career the politics too often get ahead of the action so points that might have been subtly embedded in the story are instead laid out like a left-wing editorial. To be fair Green Zone saddles itself with the unenviable task of educating a mass audience on concepts like de-Baathification and the ethnic divisions that continue to make the dream of a unified democratic Iraq maddeningly elusive. But it does establish a clear through-line in Damon who stars as an Army warrant officer whose unit is tasked with finding the WMD that were ostensibly Americas reason for going to war. As mission after mission comes up empty the increasingly disillusioned Damon starts questioning the identity and motives of ""Magellan"" the highly protected source of this faulty information. In his quest for the truth he aligns himself with a CIA operative (Brendan Gleeson) with similar goals but comes into conflict with a Pentagon neo-con (Greg Kinnear) who treats the WMD problem like a PR kerfuffle. Based on Rajiv Chandrasekarans book Imperial Life In The Emerald City Green Zone works brilliantly whenever it gets its hands dirty and follows Damon through the chaos of a city without electricity water or the most basic security and order. It also explicates as well as it can the post-war mistakes laid out by documentaries like No End In Sight specifically the tragic arrogance and stupidity of officials who decided to dismantle the Iraqi military and its bureaucratic infrastructure. But whenever Greengrass and his screenwriter Brian Helgeland pull back and look at the bigger picture Green Zone suddenly turns into something like Oliver Stones W. a clunky assortment of hindsight-aided quotes and talking points masquerading as recent history. Its an important lesson but Greengrass against his nature feels too inclined to spell it out for us.

"Green Zone | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; green-zone ) Green Zone (United States/United Kingdom/France/Spain 2010) March 10 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli When the invasion of Iraq transpired in 2003 assurances came down from on high that this act was necessary to remove the clear and present danger represented by Sadaam Husseins weapons of mass destruction (this is when the acronym WMD entered the common lexicon). Seven years later the full truth remains murky but one thing is indisputable there were no WMDs in Iraq and the intelligence that placed them there was faulty. Whether the intelligence failure was a result of lies incompetence or deliberately manipulated misinformation has been the fodder of much speculation. Paul Greengrass Green Zone a thriller set in Baghdad during the early months of the Coalition occupation takes the view that it was a little of all three. Backed by the expose provided by former Washington Post Baghdad correspondent Rajiv Chandrasekaran in his book Imperial Life in the Emerald City Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland have crafted a fictional story with some powerful non-fictional elements. It argues forcefully that conspiracy theorists arent always wrong. Chief warrant officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is cool and competent as he goes about his job of tracking down WMDs in the newly ""liberated"" Iraq. Frustration is setting in however because all the sites he has been sent to secure are empty and casualties have been absorbed in the process. Bureaucrat Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) who represents the Bush administration in Iraq argues that the WMD intelligence is correct the result of detailed information provided by the mysterious informant ""Magellan."" CIA operative Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) disagrees and privately informs Miller that there wont be any WMDs at the next site either. Brown is correct. Meanwhile an Iraqi called ""Frankie"" (Khalid Abdalla) approaches Millers unit with information about a high-ranking member of the Republican Guard arriving at a nearby house. That individual is General Al Rawi (Igal Naor) the ""Jack of Clubs"" in the Iraq deck. Both Poundstone and Brown want Al Rawi found albeit for different reasons. As Millers investigations intensify he finds himself in the uncomfortable position of being hunted by fellow soldiers. When he asks Brown if they arent all on the same side he is tersely rebuked ""Dont be naA-ve."" Although Chandrasekarans book is attached to the movie Green Zone is not an adaptation. Greengrass and Helgeland have used information from Imperial Life in the Emerald City as background information but the book and the movie are entirely different. One key variant is that while Chandrasekaran is unafraid to name names and point fingers Greengrass has opted for fictionalized alter-egos. Still its not hard to figure out who represents whom at least insofar as the main characters are concerned. It has been speculated that Roy Miller is based on Monty Gonzalez Poundstone represents Paul Bremmer and Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) is a stand-in for The New York Times Judith Miller. Greengrass has crafted Green Zone as a high energy thriller. The level of tension starts out high and rarely lets up during the course of nearly two hours. In many ways the basic story is an old fashioned staple of the genre the noble man discovers that he is surrounded by corruption and seeks to unearth the truth. Although Miller is clearly the hero and Poundstone and his cronies are the villains there are more shades of gray than pure black-and-white. Greengrass in-your-face style is mostly an asset with the hand-held camera shots ratcheting up the urgency and amplifying the sense of chaos that blossoms in firefights. There are times however as in the action sequences that comprise the climax when the moving camera and fast editing make it difficult to discern everything thats happening. In this Green Zone reflects The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum although the visual tapestry is more coherent. Greengrass visual aesthetic is a melding of the high octane approach applied to the two Bourne films and the quasi-documentary style of United 93. John Powells score is utilized to amplify the atmospherics and sustain the suspense. Damons prior appearances as Jason Bourne make him credible in this role. Theres never a disconnect to see him in this heroic action-oriented part. His clean-cut good looks and open demeanor make it easy to trust Miller who becomes our guide into the murky and corrupt world of political gamesmanship. Greg Kinnear who can play the nicest guy in the world as effectively as a snake-oil salesman oozes malice fueled by idealism. Brendan Gleeson provides that rarest of rare cinematic creatures a trustworthy and honest CIA operative. Khalid Abdalla who appeared as one of the hijackers in United 93 plays Millers reluctant translator who struggles with divided loyalties. Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of Green Zone is the manner in which it interweaves fact and fiction into an engaging whole. Although the production is explicitly critical of the Bush administration thats not the point of the movie. This is a kinetic thriller and the years of hindsight between the invasion and today allow us to view Millers discovery through a sharp lens. Green Zone will satisfy those who enjoy political thrillers and those who prefer something more action-oriented.

"Green Zone review Truth is a casualty - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsGreen Zone review Truth is a casualtyGreengrass direction cant power past an improbable scriptMarch 11 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic (Jonathan Olley Associated Press)When Paul Greengrass made ""United 93"" in 2006 the chorus was heard throughout America too soon too soon. Once folks actually caught up with it however many realized it wasnt. By sticking fastidiously to the terrifying procedural at hand the documentary-trained director fashioned one of the most urgent films of the new century. Greengrass has made four of them which is remarkable. In addition to the earlier docudrama ""Bloody Sunday"" his ""Bourne"" films (""Supremacy"" and ""Ultimatum"") stripped the usual action tricks down to the bone and the results were pure kinetic exhilaration with a brain. After sitting on a shelf for a bit his latest ""Green Zone"" opens this week days after another fictionalized Iraq war film picked up the Oscar for best film of 2009. Good timing? Lousy? The marketplace will decide. But while Greengrass delivers a very skillfully made package featuring Matt Damon (whose work becomes better and more direct with each assignment) in the leading role ""Green Zone"" is the film oddly that feels like a too-soon proposition. To me its too soon or perhaps just too depressing to turn recent tragic and grimly well-documented geopolitical events (spoiler alert Im about to express a political opinion) that did not reflect well on Americas place and purpose in the world into simplified thriller-friendly material. ""Green Zone"" is partly real and partly increasingly fantastic and outlandish in its wishful thinking. An Army warrant officer hunting for WMDs the fictional Miller (Damon) begins his third straight zero-sum search for Saddams chemical weapons at the pictures start. He is a frustrated good man in a frustrating bad place in the year 2003. In screenwriter Brian Helgelands story he is apparently the only member of the military who has any doubts about the weapons existence. He knocks heads with everyone in Baghdad from the neocon Pentagon huckster ( Greg Kinnear) peddling bad intel to the scary Special Forces op ( Jason Isaacs) who were told by a sympathetic but overmatched CIA analyst ( Brendan Gleeson) is not on Millers side. Everyones after one of Saddams top military figureheads a Baathist leader who has gone underground and who knows what Miller wants to learn. Its never dull and its often truly exciting. Greengrass technique is as spatially and rhythmically aggressive as ever braking right at the brink of visual incoherence. Yet the style verges on nervous visual affectation. As Miller learns the truth and the folly of his mission the film (shot mostly in Morocco and Spain) becomes movie-er and more polemical as it goes. Even if you agree with its polemics that doesnt make them any more useful in the context of a ""Bourne""-steeped genre thriller. Its too soon to turn what happened into ""one mans war."" mjphillipstribune.com 2 1/2 stars MPAA rating R (for violence and language)Cast Matt Damon (Miller); Greg Kinnear (Clark Poundstone); Brendan Gleeson (Martin Brown); Amy Ryan (Lawrie Dayne); Khalid Abdalla (Freddy); Jason Isaacs (Briggs)Credits Directed by Paul Greengrass; written by Brian Helgeland inspired by the book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" by Rajiv Chandrasekaran; produced by Tim Bevan Eric Fellner Lloyd Levin and Greengrass.

Wearing standard combat gear accessorized with an Arab kaffiyeh knotted around his neck Damon is U.S. Army chief warrant officer Roy Miller whos stationed in Baghdad at the start of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq in 2003. Millers squadron is on a mission to find weapons of mass destruction since the highly reliable intelligence confirming Iraqi president Saddam Husseins deadly stash of WMD is what persuaded Congress to authorize George W. Bush to invade the country in the first place. But there are no WMD to be found. And Miller a serious man has begun to wonder Why is the intel so bad? Not that he gets much time to sit around thinking. Green Zone is a strangely dated foolishly grandiose simplistically angry fictional war-zone thriller about how one patriot blows the lid off Americas missteps in Iraq. Its the work of Paul Greengrass the same adrenaline-generating filmmaker who put Damon through his action-hero paces in The Bourne Supremacy (2004) and The Bourne Ultimatum (2007). In his Bourne projects as well as in his more documentary-style re-creations such as Bloody Sunday (2002) and United 93 (2006) Greengrass specializes in a high-wire visual vocabulary that not only enhances action sequences but turns even sit-down meetings into nerve-racking affairs. From the moment we meet Miller and his men as they secure a reputed WMD storage facility (""Clear"") and risk their lives for zilch the movie never walks when it can run never runs when it can race with bullets flying overhead and never leaves room for a sentient audience to draw its own conclusions when the filmmakers can poke a finger in our collective chest and growl ""Look how Bush and company screwed up here and here and HERE."" Green Zones didactic script by Mystic River screenwriter Brian Helgeland is based on Imperial Life in the Emerald City Inside Iraqs Green Zone by former Washington Post Baghdad bureau chief Rajiv Chandrasekaran but it converts that indispensable nonfiction book into a wild whistle-blowing fable. The more sober 2007 documentary No End in Sight produced powerful evidence of fatally poor decision-making in Iraq. But in Green Zones 2003 Baghdad alleys Miller operates like a one-man truth squad piecing together all the ways that his men -- and by extension the American public -- were duped into invasion. A disillusioned CIA operative (Brendan Gleeson with an American accent subject to power failures) steers Miller in one direction; a dangerous gung ho doofus of a State Department operative (Greg Kinnear) spins him in another. A credulous Wall Street Journal journalist (Amy Ryan) unsubtly modeled on New York Times journalist Judith Miller buys into the disinformation shes been fed. Theres also a helpful patriotic Everyman Iraqi citizen (Khalid Abdalla) who calls himself Freddy. Initially hes roughed up by suspicious U.S. soldiers when he volunteers useful information; then hes hustled into service as Millers translator and driver. Eventually Freddy comes to regret that he thought his new American ""friends"" could ever help keep his family safe. Greengrass has a compulsively watchable style and a sharp understanding of Damons unlikely strengths as an action hero; the director plays off the actors understated efficiency and physical stolidity in scenes of mad danger. The standoffs showdowns and cat-and-mouse chases are bracing sometimes even Bourne cool. What Green Zone lacks however is gravitas perspective and (since it was shot two years ago) timeliness Why wasnt this out before the 2008 elections? Until now Ive been immune to ""Iraq fatigue"" the diagnosis invented for why audiences stay away from good movies about U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. (Even the apolitical Oscar winner The Hurt Locker earned peanuts at the box office.) With Green Zone though the malaise has finally hit me. So while Damons Miller uncovers the (inconvenient) truth of why the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 all I want to know is How does he suggest we get out?

Green Zone Fair to good Director Paul Greengrass. Cast Matt Damon Greg Kinnear Brendan Gleeson. Rating Rated R for violence and language. RELATED Movies about Iraq and the Middle East Spotlight Matt Damon Spotlight Greg Kinnear ""All theyre interested in is something they can hold up on CNN."" ""Civil war in six months I guarantee it."" ""Your government wanted to hear the lie."" ""It is not for you to decide what happens here."" Place all that between ""shock and awe"" and ""mission accomplished"" and it sizes up the war in Iraq pretty nicely doesnt it? The quotes may sound as if they come from a documentary about the invasion of Iraq undertaken under the pretense of capturing weapons of mass destruction or WMD that Saddam Hussein was supposedly manufacturing there. Instead they arrive courtesy of ""Green Zone"" director Paul Greengrass film about how things went so wrong in so many ways. Working from Brian Helgelands script (""inspired by"" Rajiv Chandrasekarans book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"") Greengrass uses his trademark handheld camera style (and thats a hand with a serious shake) to create what may be a new genre the historical non-stop action drama. Matt Damon plays Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller whose unit is charged with finding WMD. When a third consecutive ""confirmed"" site turns up empty - its a defunct toilet factory - he begins to realize that this isnt just coincidence. Its not simply a matter of frustration; men are fighting and dying trying to secure these sites so that Millers team can investigate. Greengrass as expected is expert at capturing the confusion amidst the violence of these fights the handheld style fitting in with the general chaos. Miller expresses his concern to his superiors but theyre not interested in hearing it. Finding WMD may be the ultimate public-relations win a justification for war. The administration needs it the American people want it and Miller and his team will find it end of story. As we know now its hard to find what isnt there. That hardly matters to Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear whose outstanding smirk is put to excellent use here) the administration envoy who insists that the intel must be trusted and that democracy most assuredly will take root in Iraq whether anyone really wants it or not. Poundstone also must contend with Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) - clearly modeled on former New York Times reporter Judith Miller - who has been writing all along that sources have confirmed the WMD; she too is anxious for proof and frustrated that it hasnt arrived. Miller helped by a local man named Freddy (Khalid Abdalla delightful) senses that hes uncovered the truth but proving it will require beating other U.S. troops to an Iraqi general in an all-out extended chase and action sequence that takes up a good bit of the last act. Miller is a good man a decent sort who had no intention of striking out on his own against the wishes of his superiors. Its a situation forced upon him in his view. ""I thought we were all on the same side"" he complains early on to C.I.A. veteran Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) who sneers ""Dont be naive"" in reply. In retrospect Browns words sound more like an epitaph than advice. Its certainly interesting to see whats been reported on the manipulation of information played out as drama and the acting is uniformly good. To pretend that the film doesnt make a political statement is silly. Of course it does. It wouldnt be effective at all if it didnt. In fact its easy to begin to work up a good deal of righteous bile and anger watching ""Green Zone"" as we are again reminded of what led us to war. But then a mortar whizzes by and the camera shakes and an explosion rocks the frame and off we go again Miller on the run chasing the truth at breakneck speed and theres no longer time to think.

Hoberman Matt Damons WMD of a Movie Green Zone Tuesday March 9 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Gunning for the truthJonathan Olley A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Better late than never--a bang-bang pulse-pounder predicated on the Bush administrations deliberate fabrication of WMD in Iraq. Paul Greengrasss expertly assembled Green Zone has evidently been parked for some time on Universals shelf. Had the movie been released during the 2008 election season it might have been something more than entertainment. Still Green Zone which could have more accurately been titled Told You So Jerk-Off does gain some coincidental topicality for opening just days after the Iraqi elections and the release of Karl Roves new book Courage and Consequence even if the zeitgeist has moved on with the unwinnable war now in Afghanistan and the Bush disaster barely a memory.Liberals take such solace as you can. Green Zone is at least a credible piece of movie-making--easily grasped as an amalgam of Greengrasss artfully verite docudramas Bloody Sunday and United 93 and his Matt Damonized conspiratorial thrillers The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum. A master of smash-mash montage and choreographed chaos Greengrass is the best action director working today adroit at producing the sense of everyone converging and everything happening simultaneously. From the opening frenzy of hopped-up shock-and-awe panic among the Iraqi leadership to the frantic final chopper chase through the back alleys of downtown Baghdad the movie is nonstop havoc. You catch your breath only to have the wind knocked out by the mirage of the carefree scene around the Green Zone swimming pool.Green Zone is set in the early months of the Iraq War and seen through the eyes of Matt Damons chief warrant officer parachuted in from a Universal story conference to find Saddams hidden Weapons of Mass Destruction. After three successive sites yield nothing but mobs of looters and calcified pigeon shit Damon is pissed; whats more he has the guts to stand up at a mass briefing and complain. Boldly asking for the intel source hes slapped down by the brass brushed off by his CO and told by a Pentagon smoothie (Greg Kinnear) that ""Democracy is messy."" Then following a tip by a friendly Iraqi (Khalid Abdalla) Damon begins to get the picture and sense the fix even as the Defense Department operatives initiate what amounts to a cover-up coup against the (here good-guy) CIA.Greengrasss pyrotechnics aside Green Zone works mainly because of the hardworking always-believable Damon. The ultimate good soldier in Saving Private Ryan the cleverest of con men in The Talented Mr. Ripley Damon is still a juvenile at 40. He has made a career of alternately projecting and parodying boyish idealism sometimes in the same movie (e.g. The Informant). For Green Zone hes Bourne again with a difference a gung-ho figure of incredulous righteous indignation. If there are no WMD in Iraq then Whats the Muthafuckin Deal?No characters have any more depth than that but Greengrass has a knack for visual shorthand (a whiff of Abu Ghraib a taste of ""Mission Accomplished"") and stereotypes in motion. He gets maximum mileage out of the twitch beneath Kinnears Rum-dumb diffidence the pained flicker of acknowledgment when smart-ass reporter Amy Ryan realizes shes been played for a chump and CIA man Brendan Gleesons galumphing kick-away-the-barstool call to arms. And hats off to Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland for allowing Abdallas everyman Iraqi patriot to intervene with the movies big unanswerable line ""Eet eez not for you Amer-r-ricans to decide wot hoppenz heere""As black and white as Helgelands script is the movie may still be too nuanced for mass consumption. As Damons idealism merges with realpolitik the ultimate issue is whether to deal or not with a Baathist general. In the end though action trumps logic. Damons two-fisted patriotic mega-rogue boy-scout-cum-investigative-soldier is a far less likely figure than the thrill-crazy hero of The Hurt Locker--grabbing Kinnear by his collar and hissing ""Do you have any idea what youve done here?"" while Ryan stands by wincing in shame. That kiss-off is a bonanza of false consolation that transports the movie into the fantasy zone of Inglourious Basterds. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

So vivid and convincingly realistic is the physical depiction of Baghdad in the early days of the American occupation that the introduction of trumped-up thriller elements feels like an unwanted intrusion in ""Green Zone."" A companion piece to ""United 93"" as a portrayal of American reaction -- this time misguided -- to 9/11 Paul Greengrass high-voltage action drama does a better job of defining where the U.S. went hopelessly wrong on Iraq than it does in creating a plausible suspense scenario. The acclaim for ""The Hurt Locker"" notwithstanding the commercial jinx of Iraq War stories has yet to be broken although with a vigorously virile Matt Damon leading the charge this Universal release should go a bit further at the B.O. than its predecessors. Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland have devised a storyline involving a committed but quickly skeptical soldiers search for weapons of mass destruction that comfortably doubles as an incisive critique of the false premise upon which the Bush Administration based its invasion. The interlocking of form and content remains intact for at least the first half of the picture but once Damons one-man truth squad goes off the reservation and starts behaving too much like Jason Bourne for comfort the film begins not only spilling more blood but also leaking crucial credibility. Notably the picture is credited as having been ""inspired"" by Rajiv Chandrasekarans superb book ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" rather than ""based"" on it. Having covered the Middle East and the Iraq War for the Washington Post Chandrasekaran wrote a pointed nonfiction tome that detailed the arrogant absurd and tragic aspects of the Americans behavior naming names and documenting everything but with a tone that often recalled the darkly comic vein of ""Catch-22"" or ""MASH."" This prompts the question of whether the public is ready for a bleakly humorous cinematic treatment of Iraq. The answer to that is in the right hands any subject is fair game for humor. But Greengrass is very far from being that sort of filmmaker. Employing his customary whiplash style of shooting and editing he wants to plunk the viewer right down in the hellish anarchy that Baghdad soon became in 2003 after the Americans rolled in and were faced with far greater challenges on the ground than they anticipated. Army Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Damon) has a single objective to find the WMD the U.S. government is certain Saddam Hussein has hidden in various sites around Iraq. As every location he and his small unit search turns up empty it doesnt take long for Miller to conclude theres something wrong with Pentagon intelligence. But the last guy who wants to hear this is Washingtons newly arrived viceroy Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) who cant be bothered with doubts that might interfere with his mission to reshape Iraq into a Middle Eastern bastion of American-style democracy. Also on the scene is Wall Street Journal reporter Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) whose articles have long seconded the administrations conviction about WMD due to intel provided by a confidential source called ""Magellan."" Amusingly the character who is depicted in the most favorable light in that he recognizes the game for what it is is old CIA hand Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson). Grizzled and cynical like a character out of Graham Greene Brown is derided by Poundstone as a ""dinosaur"" but he provides Miller with an unlikely source of support and backdoor assistance. From the opening scenes which first depict Iraqi officials flight in the wake of ""shock and awe"" then Millers initial mission as his men take out a sniper firing from an alleged WMD hideaway Greengrass again asserts himself as the foremost practitioner of ""you are there"" filmmaking. Locations in three different countries -- Spain Morocco and the U.K. -- are brilliantly integrated to rep Baghdad Saddams grandiose palace and surrounding areas and production designer Dominic Watkins deserves a special salute for the verisimilitude of whats onscreen at every moment. Would that the invented scenario were as entirely convincing. Once Poundstone realizes Miller is no longer onboard with the administrations program the gung-ho soldier is forced to go rogue. Increasingly functioning as a proxy private detective or investigative reporter Miller aided by a wonderful local character named Freddy (Khalid Abdalla) is able to pursue the Magellan mystery when he locates a cabal of former Saddam insiders leading to a frenetic and rather protracted nocturnal action climax that feels far too concocted as a genre film payoff to play well here. A number of far-fetched coincidences and contrivances add to the undesired impression of narrative artifice. Press notes quote Greengrass to the effect that ""Green Zone"" was not designed to promote any political agenda -- a disingenuous remark to say the least when his film concludes with a shot of a giant oil refinery. Basically the picture is the first narrative feature to have digested and synthesized the essential information expressed in Charles Fergusons superlative 2007 docu ""No End in Sight"" about the misconceptions miscalculations and misrepresentations involved in Bushs Iraq policies. And while the usual disclaimer insists that all the characters herein are fictitious its crystal-clear that Poundstone is Paul Brenner and Dayne is former New York Times reporter Judith Miller. The jittery camerawork familiar from Greengrass previous work and here implemented by Barry Ackroyd achieves visceral reactions at times but at other moments one yearns for the sort of visual sharpness with which similar scenes of urban combat were shot in ""Black Hawk Down."" Visual effects make possible some exceptional panoramic vistas of Baghdad under siege.

By Anthony Lane Matt Damon searches for weapons of mass destruction in Paul Greengrasss movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell The fact that ""Green Zone"" begins with a bombing raid should come as no surprise given that the director is Paul Greengrass. He made two of the ""Bourne"" films and ""United 93"" and his attitude to the average viewer remains that of a salad spinner toward a lettuce leaf. You dont so much watch a Greengrass film as cling on tight and pray. The zone of the title is the enclave from within which the Coalition Provisional Authority tried to govern Iraq after the war in 2003 and our hero is Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon). Boy is he a hero fit pensive rough when required and so unceasingly moral that on entering the hotel room of a blond unaccompanied American reporter named Lawrie Dayne (Amy Ryan) he engages her in a constructive discussion of journalistic sources and then--I can still hardly believe this--he leaves. No shock no awe no combat-calming sex. All he wants is truth. Miller heads a unit that in the wake of the invasion is told to seek out weapons of mass destruction; with hindsight we realize that he might have had more success looking for live unicorns but there you go. As one search after another comes up empty Miller confides his doubts to senior officers who dont want to know. As for Clark Poundstone (Greg Kinnear) an intelligence agent for the Pentagon (youd never guess he was the bad guy would you?) he treats any skepticism as unpatriotic. The only one who listens to Miller is Martin Brown (Brendan Gleeson) a bearish C.I.A. staffer who actually has a grasp of the region--or in the words of the sneering Poundstone ""a lot of preconceived ideas."" Miller is seconded to Brown (the film is hazy on military-command structures) and told to bring in General al Rawi (Igal Naor) a senior Iraqi who could hold a clue to the elusive weapons. You may not buy all this but then most of Greengrasss audience will be neither scholars of Iraqi politics nor conspiracy theorists with damp palms and narrowed eyes; they will be natural Bourne lovers who want the camera to start shaking and grooving in the first minute and never stop. They have their wish. From the echoing factory that Miller scours in his first scene to the climactic wasteland through which he his interpreter (Khalid Abdalla) and the bullish Briggs (Jason Isaacs) from Special Forces prowl after dark--all for different reasons in pursuit of al Rawi--""Green Zone"" approaches every human activity as if preparing to defibrillate. The wasteland is filmed on the run under the grainy murk that you get from night-vision goggles. Nowhere is stillness permitted; even when Miller safe in his room Googles the reporters name we are yanked into closeups of the relevant words on his screen. As for John Powells score insanely drum-heavy it reminds me of the islanders in ""King Kong"" summoning their favorite ape and Greengrass is happy to unleash the beat for something as uneventful as a passing convoy of vehicles--the plan being of course to make us believe that there is an event coming probably of the incendiary kind. This pathological wish to thrill delivers diminishing returns. It gave better value in the Bourne films which for all their low moods were fired by basic fantasy whereas the excitements of ""Green Zone"" sit uneasily with its examination of the real and recent past. The credits say that it was inspired by ""Imperial Life in the Emerald City"" Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfictional account of life within--and beyond--the Green Zone but the books task was to unearth a fiasco its comedy so black and dense that you could pump it out of the ground. Many filmmakers would have leaped at the textural contrast between life on the street and the sheen of unreality inside what Chandrasekaran calls Baghdads Little America but Greengrass is too caught up in the heros quest to notice. What lends the film its grip and its haste is also what makes it unsatisfactory since the end result of Millers hectic hunt is to ""solve"" the puzzle of W.M.D. ""If you pull this off you might just save the country"" Brown tells him but that is a fantasy more lurid than anything in the Bourne franchise. One of the charges against the Bush Administration was that it sought to encase Iraq in a narrative far too naive and restrictive for any nation to bear; and in its small way ""Green Zone"" a left-wing movie that looks and sounds like a right-wing one suffers from the same delusion. The story of American involvement in the eyes of this film is neither a monstrous folly nor a patient difficult path to democratic peace. Its a wrap. A lady in late middle age politely dressed wanders through a meadow in the morning. The air is bright with a trace of mist in the distance. You can hear birdsong and the strumming of a guitar. Gods in His Heaven you would say and alls right with the world. So begins ""Mother"" a new movie from Bong Joon-ho the most venturesome of South Korean directors. But anyone who saw his previous film ""The Host"" which followed the career of a gigantic fanged tadpole around the waterways of Seoul will know that peacefulness under the auspices of this filmmaker can never be more than an interlude. And so it proves with ""Mother."" All we soon realize is wrong with the world; the town that the characters inhabit may be small (most of them seem to know or know of one another) but there are hints of rot in the wider society. When a schoolgirl is killed her body is draped over the parapet of an abandoned building--not hidden away but hung up like a trophy in full view as if to alarm and indict the sprawl of ramshackle houses that stretches down the hill. The chief suspect is a local boy Do-joon (Won Bin) twenty-seven years old but a boy nonetheless. He lives with--and still sleeps beside--his doting mother (Kim Hye-ja) the woman we saw in the meadow. Until youve seen her dote you dont know what doting is. She sells medicinal herbs and watches over her son from her shop as he lounges across the street. When they eat she tenderly picks chicken off the bone to lay on his dish adding that the recipe is ""good for your virility."" Yes Mother. He is a simple soul presumably harmless and so when the cops arrest him for the murder with witnesses who place him at the scene his mother embarks on a fervid fight for justice. With what little funds she has she hires a lawyer but he is a waste of space. We last see him clutching a microphone at a karaoke joint with escort girls clinging to him like starfish and two public officials beside him felled by drink. Do-joon himself was blurry with beer at the time of the crime and you can practically hear the deep stream of alcohol that flows beneath the movie flooding every class and profession. What common sorrows you want to ask are being drowned? As in every Bong picture even the sombre ""Memories of Murder"" (2005) this melancholia comes with a chaser of farce. People take tumbles a ridiculous fight breaks out on a golf course cars get sideswiped for no reason and when the killing is reconstructed in public using a lightweight silver dummy the head keeps falling off much to the amusement of the townsfolk who have turned out en masse for the occasion. Beyond that however lies a more disturbing sense of the inappropriate; it is one thing for the mother to protest her sons innocence quite another to show up at the victims funeral and you increasingly wonder whether Do-joons emotional shortfall might not be inherited. The fact that ""Mother"" keeps its balance is a tribute to the leading actress who--even as her character becomes an amateur sleuth and stumbles into evidence of nastiness and sexual profligacy--takes care to preserve the decorum of her age and gender. In one delectable scene she is interrupted in a clue hunt and taking cover behind a curtain is forced to watch a young couple making love. Well not forced but as we observe in a trembling closeup her spying eye first looks then looks away then takes another look. Toward the end something wrecks the movies equipoise a deed that tilts us away from ordinary decencies toward the irrevocably savage. Although viewers with a blood thirst will accept this it struck me as a rare misstep on Bongs part; it stiffens and calcifies the half-comic pliable view of human behavior that usually prevails in the directors work. At one point somebody claims that most killings are driven by ""money passion or vengeance"" but the rest of the film suggests that we should never ignore the power of the accidental and the throwaway too. I believe in that suggestion and I was sorry to see it forsaken as the plot abandons familiar ground and heads into a fantastical bad dream. Still there remains so much to relish and remember; as the tiny maternal figure framed against the foggy vastness of a mountain tramps through the rain on her remorseless quest to exculpate Do-joon we can but conclude that a boys best friend as Norman Bates liked to say is his mother.

Plus the frenetic attack of Green Zone. By David Edelstein Published Mar 7 2010 ShareThis (Photo David Moir/Courtesy of Apparition) People will probably run to The Runaways the story of the pioneering seventies girl group to see Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett earn a bad reputation she doesnt give a damn about and little Dakota Fanning as 15-year-old Cherie Currie strut around the stage in skimpy outfits ch-ch-chanting that shes a ch-ch-cherry bomb and join Stewart in some heavy Sapphic smooching. In patches its agreeably lurid but its otherwise ho-hum. Although Jett is the coexecutive producer and Stewart the star the Jett character is mostly a bystander She stands by as rock impresario Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) assembles the pubescent girl band (as Malcolm McLaren assembled the Sex Pistols) then stands by some more as Currie the groups blonde-bombshell mascot falls apart from the drugs and sex and Fowley abuse. (The film is based on Curries slim autobiography published little more than a decade after the Runaways imploded.) As onetime member Victory Tischler-Blues documentary Edgeplay makes clear the vibe among the bandmates was never good and since the music itself is secondary theres not a lot to this story. The film is all externals. Shannon looks scary and stops the show with his rants but hes too endearingly damaged too nice to convey the real Fowleys otherworldly creepiness. Its Fannings movie You can taste the exchild actors relish for playing jailbait. But can she be ogled in good conscience? The taste is sweet and sour. When you study the subjects faces in policy wonk Charles Fergusons No End in Sight a sober 2007 documentary about the first year of the Iraq occupation you see not anger but bewilderment How could the Pentagon which allegedly fixed the intel around the policy get it so wrong? Were they so arrogant so obtuse that they couldnt foresee the deadly forces they were about to unleash? Hell yes avers Paul Greengrasss tumultuous conspiracy thriller Green Zone which is like No End in Sight with gun battles and cliff-hangers a boffo anti-Bush-administration answer to TVs hawkish 24. Matt Damon plays Army chief warrant officer Roy Miller whose team of (heavily armed) inspectors moves from site to site searching for WMDs taking casualties and coming up with doughnut holes. Pissed off he accosts an administration tool (Greg Kinnearis he meant to be Paul Bremer? Doug Feith?) who insists that the intel is dandy and prepares for the ultimate coup outlawing Saddams Baath Party and disbanding the Iraqi military. So Miller goes rogue and joins forces with a CIA vet (Brendan Gleeson) who sees Iraq exploding into civil war if the Baathists are banished. You might charge Brian Helgelands script (inspired by Rajiv Chandrasekarans nonfiction account Imperial Life in the Emerald City) with twenty-twenty hindsight except the book and doc prove that back in 2003 those warnings were expressedand suppressed. And even the foresight shouldve been twenty-twenty A 6-year-old with glaucoma couldnt have missed the coming conflagration. Green Zone is a slam-bam piece of muckraking and to my mind dead-on in its depiction of a traumatized Iraqi populace a criminally misused American military and a U.S.-backed charlatan (Ahmed Chalabi by another name) who smugly believes he can ease into leadership. But its also rather tawdry. The climax is as ludicrous as any Jack Bauer adventure and Greengrass is always on shaky ground. Literally. As in his Bourne movies his handheld camera shimmies and swerves using battlefield verite to drive home the faux realism. In the Greengrass zone theres no time or space for the quiet revelation the offhand but crystalline detail that transcends the melodramatic agenda. Its only the adrenaline-inducing techniques that conceal the lack of imagination. And its only Damons credible low-key acting that keeps the final twist involving a Baathist general and a reporter (Amy Ryan) clearly modeled on the New York Times Judith Miller (shes identified as from The Wall Street Journal) from seeming as preposterous as it is. Ryans Lawrie Dayne is rattled at the thought that shed been fooled by a Pentagon-staged farce involving a top-secret informanta marked contrast to the real Miller who defended her credulous reporting and loved her some Chalabi. A Hollywood touch Shes pleased at the thought of Roy Miller spilling the beans instead of monomaniacally assertinglike so many others in those dark yearsthat the catastrophic course must be stayed.
