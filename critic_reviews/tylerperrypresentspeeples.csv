Free of the moralizing heavy-handed awkward theatricality of Perrys films this Meet the Parents-ish fish-out-of-water comedy is pleasant if inane - helped along by a likable cast thats clearly having fun. The setup is familiar Childrens entertainer Wade Walker (Craig Robinson) intent on proposing to his girlfriend Grace Peeples (the never-not-watchable Kerry Washington) decides to surprise her at her familys summer home in Sag Harbor. Turns out the family home is more of a mansion and Graces strict federal judge dad Virgil (Grier) and recovering 70s disco queen mom Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) have never heard of Wade. The daughter has been too concerned about her familys judgment and obsession with status to ever disclose that shes seeing somebody who might not be up to snuff Wades main achievement is going around to elementary schools and singing kids a song about how not to pee their pants. (""Speak it dont leak it."") The Peeples family though is full of secrets of its own Graces sister Gloria (Kali Hawk) is a closeted lesbian and shes just arrived with her secret lover Meg (Kimrie Lewis-Davis); brother Simon (Tyler James Williams) on the other hand is a klepto. Oh and Mom still has substance abuse issues. Drugs stealing hidden sexual identities ... theres potential for serious melodrama here which makes you even more glad that Tyler Perry is nowhere to be found as a writer or actor in this film. (This is Chisms directorial debut; her previous screenplays were for the decent rollerskating/coming-of-age movie ATL and the terrific marching band drama Drumline.) Robinson maintains an air of exasperated bemusement throughout which makes him a good audience stand-in. And Washington so underused and yet still so riveting recently in Django Unchained gets to do a great juggling act She has to be aggressively pleasant to everybody while keeping her escalating anxiety and terror at bay. (One wonders if the film might have been far more satisfying had it centered on her character as shes the one with the real dilemma here.) Meanwhile Grier captures just the right tone of disapproving self-importance Hes not so much an overprotective paranoiac (as with De Niro in Meet the Parents) as he is a man trying to keep everything from falling apart by shutting it all down. Thats as far as it goes though. The humiliation comedy of Meet the Parents worked magnificently because the catastrophe mounted embarrassment by embarrassment. There everything was building towards a wedding. Here its a ceremonial town-wide reading of Moby Dick - an interesting concept but not one that yields much of a throughline. As a result the comic setpieces feel divorced from one another and oddly manufactured. For example a scene where Wade dons Daphnes old elaborate disco headdress and rocks out on his own seems ill-advised for a character supposedly trying hard not to screw things up Its there just so we can revel in his mortification once hes discovered. But while its predictable contrived and awkward the scene still kinda sorta almost works in part thanks to Robinsons charming presence; the actor finds a way to let his joy carry over to the audience. At times the same could be said for this film itself.

For the sake of clarity lets just name a few of them if only to get us all on the same page John Krasinski Aubrey Plaza Mark Ruffalo Emma Stone ... and now Craig Robinson. Hes officially joined the crew. These cats are extremely likable much like the person who holds the door for you when your arms are full of groceries. This likability phenomenon is a critical asset utilized by ""Peeples"" for in the hands of less pleasant persons this little movie would have slipped right off a cliff. In the end even though the plot is threadbare the conceit obvious and the material well trodden its an eminently watchable film because of Craig Robinson (as Wade) and his leading lady Kerry Washington (as Grace Peeples). This duo along with a steady supporting cast makes ""Peeples"" into a far more enjoyable experience than it has any business being; there are at least a dozen laughs to be found made possible only because youre invested in the personalities involved. The story here can easily be summed up by a 30-second trailer or heck even the poster. Wade wants to propose to Grace but he (understandably) wants to meet her family first. Unbeknownst to her he travels to Sag Harbor to surprise her and the fam of course hoping to garner Poppa Peeples approval in the process. Naturally theres the point of tension for Judge Peeples (David Alan Grier) wants zero to do with giving up his little girl and hell stop at nothing to intimidate and emasculate young Wade. The supporting cast is filled out with the traditional wacky comedy mores from the klepto younger brother (Simon played by Tyler Jones Williams) to the recovering alcoholic mother (Daphne played by S. Epatha Merkerson) but some credit must be given to the overall quirk level on display as it is a few degrees more clever than normal staid comedy filler. Throw in actor Malcolm Barrett (as Wades brother Chris) and youre left with a very capable group making the best of every situation. Indeed its in the moments where ""Peeples"" isnt trying so hard that it works pretty well when they go too hard at the comedy rim it feels like the same old drag. During the worst moments massively forced a dog humps Wade and there are songs about children peeing. Conversely when ""Peeples"" is at its best theres lively interplay between the characters showing off comedic timing done right. Unfortunately the third act of ""Peeples"" has numerous issues. Whatever the opposite of a meet-cute is lets call it a ""break-up-dull"" is thrown at the audience with little care or innovation. Of course ""Peeples"" must go this route because every romantic / familial comedy must have some false note of tension or else its not allowed to exist but it makes for a mostly putrid 20 minute segment. ""Engagement interruptus"" is the symbolic calling card of a writer throwing up his or her hands and its precisely the route ""Peeples"" heads down. You know that thing where a main character is about to make a speech only to be interrupted by something thus completely foiling their plan? ""Peeples"" has a few metric tons of this action happening wildly annoying if only because its so detached from reality. Theres never been a moment in anyones life where someone said ""I need to tell you guys something"" followed by someone else dropping a dish and then no one going back to say ""Now what were you getting at?"" Its a preposterous method this brazen attempt at miscommunication and Im not sure if it was ever effective at any point in cinema history. Everyone should stop doing this immediately; lets make ""Peeples"" the last example of it we ever see. The rule should be as follows if you can think of a point of tension in less than a minute and yet youve never seen it happen in real life then you should probably just scrap the whole idea and think of something better. Thats not too much to ask of a professional right? Still luckily ""Peeples"" saves itself from a complete belly flop by the barest of margins by leaning heavily on its initial strength of good-natured charm. This is an impossible film to hate its nowhere near awful enough and it passes the time in an acceptably speedy manner. No this wont be the movie that film students turn to and it wont end up as anyones ""Best Comedy of 2013"" but it strings together ten and fifteen minute bursts at a time of real silliness. Like most people youre liable to meet on a day-to-day basis ""Peeples"" isnt so bad. SCORE 6.5 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and enjoys Sag Harbor immensely.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Peeples Video Rated PG-13  95 minutes  2013 A sweet-natured underachiever (Craig Robinson) follows his ambitious lawyer girlfriend (Kerry Washington) to her familys resort home in the hope of winning over her father (David Alan Grier) a humorless federal judge. This big-screen sitcom barely makes sense; the characters change from connivers to gullible idiots (and vice versa) seemingly at random and one cant imagine why the mismatched lovers would be together in the first place. Writer-director Tina Gordon Chism implies that people should accept each other for who they are but with no genuine insight to back up this moral it feels hollow.

They involve an impending wedding embarrassment awkward revelations accidental ingestion of controlled substances and a clash of cultures and/or classes all in a picturesque seaside setting. You loved this movie when it was called ""Meet the Parents"" you possibly missed out on a very good version of it entitled ""Jumping the Broom"" and you may still regret walking in on the one bearing the name ""Thats My Boy"" but you know the plot beats before youve even bought your ticket. What these movies boil down to since surprise plays no role is whether or not you laugh. ""Peeples"" made me laugh. Its often rote and by-the-numbers sure but writer-director Tina Gordon Chism (the scenarist of ""Drumline"" and ""ATL"" makes her behind-the-camera debut here) injects the proceedings with enough smart chat clever situations and spot-on casting choices to make this well-traveled road feel a little less stale. Our proletarian hero is Wade (Craig Robinson) who hopes one day to be a child psychologist but currently writes ditties about bodily functions aimed at the pre-school set. Hes been living with his lawyer-at-the-U.N. girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) but on the weekend hes planning to pop the question she heads out to Sag Harbor to spend time with her immediate family an imposing clan whom Wade refers to as the ""chocolate Kennedys."" Naturally he heads out to the Hamptons to surprise her only to discover that she has never mentioned him to any of the Peeples not her federal-judge father Virgil (David Alan Grier) or her retired disco-diva mother Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) or her CNN-correspondent sister Gloria (Kali Hawk) or her nerdy kleptomaniac little brother Simon (Tyler James Williams the now-teenaged former star of ""Everybody Hates Chris""). Cue mishaps misunderstandings and misapprehensions with Wade constantly tripping over himself trying to make a good impression while discovering that the venerable Peeples all have secrets of their own. Youll see most of this coming but thankfully the screenplay is by Gordon Chism and not ""presenter"" Tyler Perry; that means we get witty repartee (when Wade learns Grace used to date lots of older guys he unleashes a barrage of hilarious insults that include references to Shirley Chisholm Benjamin Banneker and the background dancers from the ""Thriller"" video) and non-hysterical handling of the revelations regarding Gloria and her ""friend"" Meg (Kimrie Lewis-Davis). (If this film and ""Precious"" are any indication LGBT characters get much better treatment in films presented by Perry than they do in the ones written and directed by the bachelor auteur.) The cast sells the material at both its strongest and weakest. Robinson has proven himself an adept second banana on ""The Office"" and in ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" but here he balances a sweet disposition with just enough comic face-pulling to shine as a leading man. (The moment where he lip-syncs to one of Daphnes old hits is both sublimely silly and fearless.) Grace is probably written the wobbliest of the major characters but Washington makes it work; once again shes asked to squeeze into fetish wear but she looks way more comfortable in this movies schoolgirl outfit than she did all leathered up in ""A Thousand Words."" Grier spends most of the movie in a slow burn but he conducts the ebb and flow of Virgils fury with the skill of an orchestra leader. (Also stealing scenes in the small role of Wades brother Chris is ""Better Off Ted"" co-star Malcolm Barrett.) Kudos to ""Peeples"" for pairing Melvin Van Peebles and Diahann Carroll as Virgils parents; they seemed at diametric poles of the culture 35 years ago but his blaxploitation urtext ""Sweet Sweetbacks Baadassss Song"" and her mainstream sitcom ""Julia"" were both integral steps forward for African-Americans in film and television. While it would have been great for ""Peeples"" to dig further for some of its hilarity - there are subplots regarding Ana Gasteyer as the town mayor as well as a local celebration of ""Moby Dick"" that dont really go anywhere - the movie doesnt feel like a cheat. Just enjoy it as a Fokker-free Fokker film. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com5/10/2013 Editor rating 2.5 With Peeples comedian Craig Robinson of The Office joins the list of likeable chunky movie guys who inexplicably get hot significant others (in this case Kerry Washington of Scandal). He plays Wade Walker an unlicensed sort of therapist who teaches kids through song (one of his recent compositions aimed at getting kids to stop wetting their pants involves the phrase ""Speak it dont leak it""). Wade lives with Grace Peeples (Washington) an attorney from a wealthy family he calls ""the chocolate Kennedys"" none of whom hes ever been allowed to meet. Grace decides to visit them in Sag Harbor for Moby-Dick Day -- talk amongst yourselves and Im sure you can come up with any number of jokes on that inviting subject -- but refuses to invite Wade. After a pep talk from his doll doctor brother (the funny Malcolm Barrett) Wade decides to surprise her in Sag Harbor engagement ring tucked into his pocket and a proposal hovering on his lips. But he is blocked every step of the way by Graces uptight retired judge father (David Alan Grier). As you might imagine Peeples is basically a meet-the-parents-and-their-rigid-disapproval comedy with a bit of fish-out-of-water humor tossed in and while it never quite makes the leap from pleasantly amusing to absolutely hilarious its heart is in the right place. After years as a terrific deadpan ensemble player on The Office Robinson turns out to be a solid leading man. Helping shoulder the comedic load are Barrett especially in a scene in which he tries to pass himself off as a fraternity brother and young Tyler James Williams (the title character from the terrific family sitcom Everybody Hates Chris) as Graces younger thug life wannabe brother who cant quite rack up any street cred with a name like Simon. Peeples is the first film for director Tina Chism Gordon who also wrote the screenplay (she also wrote scripts for ATL and Drumline) and sometimes her inexperience shows in the choppy pacing and transitions. Theres also an unlikely subplot about Graces worldly sister in which she wonders whether she is gay -- even though the sister brought her girlfriend to the gathering. (Survey says Yes. Youre gay.) But as family comedies go Peeples has more things going for it than against it. Cast Craig Robinson Kerry Washington David Alan Grier Malcolm Barrett S.

"Comedy Peeples not much of a pleaser movie review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesComedy Peeples not much of a pleaser movie reviewPeeples is an African-American retread of Meet The Parents starring Craig Robinson Kerry Washington David Alan Grier and S. Epatha MerkersonBy Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. May 10 2013PeeplesStarring Craig Robinson Kerry Washington David Alan Grier S. Epatha Merkerson Tyler Williams Melvin Van Peebles and Diahann Carroll. Directed by Tina Gordon Chism. 95 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGOpening with a gospel-influenced song about the pitfalls of inappropriate urination nobody can accuse fractured family comedy and Meet The Parents retread Peeples of subtlety.When childrens entertainer Wade Walker (Craig Robinson of The Office and Hot Tub Time Machine) isnt instructing kids to ""Say It Dont Spray It"" with one of his motivational ditties hes plotting ways to pop the question to gorgeous girlfriend Grace Peeples (Django Unchaineds Kerry Washington).Article Continued BelowWade wont let Graces reluctance to let him meet her family stand in his way and decides to crash an upcoming weekend getaway at ""the chocolate Kennedys"" impressively elegant Sag Harbor house. He plans to get to know the Peeples clan and win over Graces daddy Virgil a stern judge who disapproves of most folks and sees life as an endless series of competitions that must be won at all cost.These Hamptons Huxtables have gathered for one of the worlds dumber get-together excuses daddy is a Herman Melville nut and its Moby Dick weekend.Patriarch Virgil (In Living Colors David Alan Grier always going for the obvious joke) hardly welcomes the schlubby oddball Wayne who his precious Grace has never even mentioned. ""You can stay here and clean my dinghy"" he tells him.But wife Daphne (Lincolns S. Epatha Merkerson) a recovering alcoholic and former disco diva who has turned from the grape to the delights of her herb garden is more easygoing.Big sister CNN reporter Gloria (Kali Hawk) and her longtime ""friend"" Meg (Kimrie Lewis-Davis) have something going on that nobody (besides the audience) seems able to see. Nor can some of the family figure out why they are ""that way"" once they do. Right Nana Peeples (Diahann Carroll)?Meanwhile younger brother Simon (Everybody Hates Chriss Tyler James Williams) cant decide whether he favours a musical career or something in a more larcenous vein.Everybody in Peeples -- except for poor Wayne -- is gorgeous successful and rich in the way only sitcom families can be. Even the bouncy score sounds like it was lifted from an old Threes Company episode; that is when theyre not all belting out a song about where its not cool to pee.Peeples marks the directing debut of screenwriter Tyler Perry protegee Tina Gordon Chism who also penned the script which inexplicably is a distant third to her better work in Drumline and ATL. She reaches hard to set up gags that end up netting tiny payoffs that are hardly worth the effort like a silly side plot involving the mayor (Ana Gasteyer).Comedy bits lean toward broad and farcical with misunderstandings missing wallets and mixed messages sprinkled with liberal doses of screwball antics. The size of the cast means the characters arent drawn with much depth but its hard not to love Merkersons goofily engaging Daphne. For his part Robinson brings a pleasing earthy charm as the everyday guy who tries his best to fit in with a lifestyle that completely escapes him. Just watch him try to play darts at a Sag Habor theme bar with his streetwise brother Chris (Malcolm Barrett) who has also crashed the weekend to act as wingman.Blessed with a title that begs for all kinds of merry wordplay Peeples started out life with a weightier title Tyler Perry Presents Peeples.Lucky for us Perry (Temptation Good Deeds and the Madea franchise) seems to have pulled back on influencing the production as part of dropping the title spotlight. While Peeples may not be especially good it is marginally better than anything Perry has put his name to. And Kim Kardashian isnt in it. So weve got that going for us.

Photo Diahann Carroll and Malcolm Barrett are part of the wacky goings-on in ""Peeples."" Diahann Carroll and Malcolm Barrett are part of the wacky goings-on in ""Peeples."" ( ) So my dream came true. Craig Robinson one of the funniest comic actors working finally got to be the leading man in a movie . . . produced by Tyler Perry. Give it up for Satan always with the clever catch hidden in the fine print. Robinson -- Darryl on ""The Office"" with memorable roles in ""Eastbound amp; Down"" ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" and ""Knocked Up"" -- may be incapable of not being funny. Id pay to see him read the stock tables. Also ""Peeples"" which is written and directed by Tina Gordon Chism (who wrote ""ATL"" and ""Drumline"") isnt really a Perry movie. Its a good-natured broad comedy episodic and sitcom-ish (without Perrys trademark soapiness). Its also largely without a plot which gives it the sense of a 30-minute situation stretched way too far. Still I laughed a few times mostly at Robinsons typically engaging Everyman turn as Wade Walker a charming but only semi-successful New Yorker. He does musical- comedy numbers for little kids advising them not to pee themselves ""Speak it dont leak it"" goes a musical number that appears three times in the movie at least a couple of times too many. Wades posh lawyer girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) lives with him but hasnt even mentioned his existence to her distinguished family and its domineering dad Judge Peeples (David Alan Grier). Wade is hurt ""Im not making sweet precious love to you until you share the chocolate Kennedys."" Nevertheless she slips away to her rich parents Sag Harbor mansion without inviting him but he pops up anyway nearly getting humped by the family dog and bringing wine because he doesnt know that his prospective mother-in-law (S. Epatha Merkerson) is an alcoholic. The class tension between Wade and Grace has the potential to be more interesting than it is ever allowed to become in the film; if she were really bothered by his humble job would she be living with him in the first place? Moreover shouldnt she be a little more upset that he essentially crashes the party at her parents house? Youd think that move would be grounds for breakup or at least a fight. Moreover Robinson spends too much of the picture reacting to other people being funny. He does lots of double-takes at the wacky goings-on in the house where the teen son (Tyler James Williams) is a genius kleptomaniac Graces CNN broadcaster sister (Kali Hawk) hasnt told the family shes a lesbian (though she did bring her girlfriend) and even buttoned-up Dad has a secret life that involves midnight skinny-dipping with hippies. But Washington is a bore in a bland role. Lost for something funny to do she finally puts on a too-small schoolgirl outfit. The script throws in one random contrivance after another without ever becoming explosive enough to qualify as farce. But Robinsons appeal holds the movie together. Hes game for anything -- riding a giant tricycle engaging in an endurance contest with the judge inside a sweat lodge and accidentally getting high on shrooms during a town re-enactment of ""Moby-Dick"" that the movie seems to think is automatically a really funny idea. (Not necessarily.) Chisms characters are pleasingly odd and though she cant string much of a narrative together -- there is a stop-and-start quality to the picture that grows tiresome -- a few of the set pieces are funny especially when Wades brother (Malcolm Barrett) a doll surgeon shows up to make things slightly crazier. Robinson deserves a movie thats polished where this one is haphazard but he needs to be able to cut loose instead of being reduced to the confusion and blanching he is often called upon to do in this one. How about a buddy movie with his old ""Office""-mate Steve Carell?

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 10 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 10 2013 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tina Gordon Chism Written by Tina Gordon Chism Starring Kerry Washington Craig Robertson David Alan Grier Malcolm Barrett Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English Tina Gordon Chism covers familiar territory here in her directorial debut Peeples is Meet the Parents by way of Tyler Perry. Chism who wrote the screenplays for Drumline and ATL has Perrys help as co-producer but its not enough.Craig Robinson a standout actor on The Office who has been lovably hilarious in a handful of small parts on the big screen including Pineapple Express and Hot Tub Time Machine gets his shot at a star role and to clash comedically with David Alan Grier. Its a shame that two gifted comedians werent given better material to work with. Multimedia Tyler Perry Presents We The Peeples The official trailer Robinson plays Wade Walker who dreams of being a child psychologist but for now pays the bills by singing songs to kids about how not to pee their pants. When his girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) leaves him behind to go to a family reunion despite the fact that Wade has asked to finally meet the Peeples clan (whom he calls the ""chocolate Kennedys"") Wade decides to just show up and ask for Graces hand in marriage.Things will go smoothly right? Or not. Graces father (Grier) a judge who insists on being called that instead of his name takes an instant dislike to Wade who fails repeatedly to win him over. The rest of the family is so afraid of Judge and his high standards that they hide their secrets from him the son with sticky fingers the daughter who is gay a wife who does shrooms. Theres also a weak subplot involving Judge and the towns mayor thats meant to show hes not who he pretends to be either. The problem isnt that the films minor conflicts and secrets are preposterous; its that theyre not preposterous enough. Unlike Meet the Parents director Jay Roach Chism doesnt know when to step on the gas and just go for belly laughs.In this type of movie - the ""guy trying to woo a girl and his family"" type - supporting players need to provide the best laughs and surprises. Like Isla Fishers kooky-sister role in Wedding Crashers. Malcolm Barrett puts in a decent comic turn as Wades brother but that and Griers scowling cant hide the fact that the rest of the group are just there to move the plot along.The bigger problem is that right from the start its clear that when the weekend is over all secrets will be revealed all rifts will be healed the Judge will see the error of his ways and Wade will be welcomed as part of the family amid all the easy moralizing. What you probably dont see coming is the family sing-along at the end. Sorry to ruin one of the few things in the movie that isnt predictable - but it might make you cringe less when it happens.And dont hold your breath for the scene in which Wade gets his seventies intergalactic groove on. Its a long story - and thats never a good thing for a comedy thats only 95 minutes long.

And that is to its benefit.In the Madea-movie tradition it concerns a big brood here the Peepleses. But its protagonist is an outsider Wade (an amiable Craig Robinson) who tries to get into the familys good graces. Wade intends to propose to his girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington appealing in an underwritten role) but first he wants to meet her family. So he drops in on the Peeples estate in Sag Harbor N.Y. for a few days of uncovering secrets Graces mom Daphne (a free-spirited S. Epatha Merkerson miles from her ""Law amp; Order"" character) a former disco star still uses drugs; her sister Gloria (the stunning Kali Hawk) is a lesbian; her brother Simon (Tyler James Williams) is a tech wizard with a streak of kleptomania; and her imperious father Virgil (David Alan Grier) a judge is almost impossible to please. Tagging along is Wades randy brother Chris (a winning Malcolm Barrett).Revelations unfold predictably but the subplots cohere and the assured pacing offers a stark contrast with the often disjointed tempos of Mr. Perrys mosaics. And Ms. Chism who also wrote the screenplay avoids Mr. Perrys judgmental often severe brand of tough love embracing instead a more benign stance of forgiveness and acceptance. You wonder what films she will create when shes out from under his shadow.""Peeples"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence sexuality and drug references.

"Review Peeples a refreshing and warm romantic comedy - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Peeples a refreshing and warm romantic comedy Peeples Nicole Rivelli / Lionsgate Kerry Washington as Grace Peeples Craig Robinson as Wade Walker and David Alan Grier as Virgil Peeples in ""Peeples."" Kerry Washington as Grace Peeples Craig Robinson as Wade Walker and David Alan Grier as Virgil Peeples in ""Peeples."" (Nicole Rivelli / Lionsgate) Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Tyler Perry is credited as a producer on ""Peeples"" but dont let that scare you away. Written and directed by Tina Gordon Chism ""Peeples"" is witty charming and light standing apart from the heavy-handed moralizing of so many of Perrys own movies.Its upbeat freshness is also distinctive from the bitter flavor of so many recent Hollywood rom-coms. Chism finds new twists in a fairly standard premise as Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) is reluctant to introduce her boyfriend to her father. Her beau Wade (Craig Robinson) is a childrens singer whose most popular song ""Speak It (Dont Leak It)"" encourages kids to use the bathroom. Her father (David Alan Grier) isnt just judgmental he actually is a federal judge.PHOTOS Hollywood Backlot moments The bulk of the story is set amid the upscale enclave of the Peeples familys summer home creating something of the casual bourgeois feel of a Nancy Meyers movie. S. Epatha Merkerson as Graces mother and Tyler James Williams as her teenage brother provide capable comedic support.A sub-story involving Graces sister (Kali Hawk) and her reluctance to come out to the family is handled in a way that feels pleasantly nonjudgmental on all sides.When Melvin Van Peebles walks on as Grandpa Peeples it is funny in many ways as a pun on his own name as a tweak of Perry-esque literalism as well as a tip of the hat to an African American independent filmmaker of an earlier generation. Van Peebles brings the perfect amount of grumpy gravitas as he dresses down Griers character in just a few lines.PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Diahann Carroll as the familys grandmother matriarch is an equally smart piece of casting.Washington long a reliable presence too often asked to do a lot with too little material has been on a tremendous recent career upswing thanks to TVs ""Scandal"" and ""Django Unchained."" She handles the female lead here with her typical grace and ease. Robinson best known for his role on ""The Office"" makes for a convincing Everyman.And a frisky scene involving an old schoolgirl uniform knee socks and a ruler encapsulates both the exuberant playfulness of the movie as well as Washington and Robinsons strong natural chemistry.Perry deserves credit for using his resources to create space for another voice to be heard. Yet focusing on Perry limp studio rom-coms and all the things that ""Peeples"" is not perhaps undersells all that it is -- an infectious warm comedy of family and communication and a promising debut as writer-director for Chism. These ""Peeples"" are people one should be happy to meet.---PeeplesRating PG-13 for some violence sexuality and drug contentRunning time 1 hour and 35 minutesPlaying In wide releasemark.olsenlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Tyler Perry Entertainment Nancy Meyers Kerry Washington David Alan Grier Craig Robinson On the Set Movies and TV The comedy Peeples marks a turning point for actor director Kerry Washington Im the luckiest broad in Hollywood now Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-peeples-review-kerry-washington-craig-robinson-20130510,0,2655360.story",200,tylerperrypresentspeeples12,tylerperrypresentspeeples,latimes

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Video Trailer Peeples More about Peeples >> When we first see Wade Walker (Craig Robinson) in Peeples - which could have been called Meet the Peeples as in Meet the Parents if the filmmakers wanted to flirt with intellectual property litigation - he is singing to a gaggle of kids. The song is ""Speak It Dont Leak It"" a catchy ditty designed to encourage preschoolers to express their feelings verbally and leave the bodily functions in the bathroom where they belong. Good advice. Peeples a likable if not exactly groundbreaking comedy doesnt get much deeper than that. But Tina Gordon Chisms debut feature does point out the hypocrisy grown-ups are capable of - hiding secrets hiding their feelings even hiding valuable property from one another. Wade a laid back childrens entertainer lives in New York with his girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) - of the well-to-do African American clan. Described as ""the chocolate Kennedys"" the family keeps a large house in the Hamptons and keep the riffraff at arms length. But even after a year of cohabitation Grace hasnt introduced her beau to her parents Virgil (David Alan Grier) a federal judge and Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) a retired disco queen. In fact Grace hasnt even mentioned Wade. And so when he decides to invite himself to the Long Island compound Grace has some explaining to do and Virgil and Daphne get to do some looking down their noses at this lowly interloper. Graces siblings the teenage Simon (Tyler James Williams) and the CNN news reporter Gloria (Kali Hawk) have their own issues - issues that come to a head as Peeples shambles its way to a comic conclusion. A Native American sweat lodge a dose of psychedelics a family bike ride and a missing pair of diamond earrings all fit into the mix. Some of these plot contrivances fit better than others. Robinson Darryl on NBCs swan-songing The Office and a droll presence in such fine film fare as Knocked Up and Hot Tub Time Machine eases into his first lead role with aplomb and theres lots of talent in the ensemble cast - even if Chisms unsurprising script doesnt always work to their favor. Diahann Carroll and Melvin Van Peebles show up as the grandparental unit (or is that Melvin Van Peeples?) getting to riff a bit too. And Tyler Perry gets a producer credit - this is his baby from his production company and it could very well enjoy some Tyler Perry-size success at the box office. Worse things could happen.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Share Comment Melvin Van Peebles director and star of the X-rated revolutionary 1971 black comedy ""Sweet Sweetbacks Baaadasssss Song"" makes an appearance in a minor role in Tina Gordon Chisms plucky entertaining debut ""Peeples."" His presence serves as a reminder of how far weve come over the past five decades in terms of racial progress on the screen. Lets see theres the money-making Tyler Perry (also a producer of this film) the Oscar-winning Denzel Washington the ubiquitous Samuel L. Jackson the rarely glimpsed Spike Lee and . . . OK so its not very encouraging. On the other hand though ""Peeples"" gets off to a hobbling start wraps up with the usual bromides and is pretty much anodyne throughout its still a lot funnier than ""The Big Wedding.""

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT May 9 2013Meeting the future in-laws is fraught with peril and some humor in this domestic comedy.Kerry Washington and Craig Robinson star as a couple spending the weekend with her family in the comedy Peeples.(Photo Nicole Rivelli Lionsgate)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review   1/2 out of fourStars Craig Robinson Kerry Washington David Alan Grier S. Epatha Merkerson Melvin Van PeeblesRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 35 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideFrom the outside looking in the Peeples are a tightly knit and intimidating clan.To working-class guy Wade Walker the affluent African-American family members are ""the chocolate Kennedys"" with a sprawling Sag Harbor vacation manse preppy pastimes and eccentric familial superstitions.Their worlds clash in the likable if formulaic fish-out-of-water comedy Peeples (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).The tale focuses on the upper-crust familys annual reunion for ""Moby Dick Day"" a Sag Harbor holiday that celebrates the towns connection to Herman Melvilles literary classic. The Peeples steadfastly follow the dictates and competitive spirit of their patriarch Virgil (David Alan Grier) a distinguished federal court jurist who insists on being addressed by outsiders as ""Judge.""Grier plays the part of the pompous patrician with superb finesse and dry wit easily the movies highlight.VIDEO Tyler Perry and his PeeplesGUIDE USA TODAYs Summer Movie CalendarMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGrace (Kerry Washington) is a daughter of Judge Peeples and the apple of his ever-watchful eye. She is also the high-powered attorney girlfriend of besotted Wade (Craig Robinson of TVs The Office). A sweet-natured regular guy who lacks an impressive family lineage Wade entertains young schoolchildren with musical ditties and hopes to get a doctorate in child psychology. How these two got together is never exactly stated but Grace is drawn to Wades accepting nature. The two have dated for over a year and share a Manhattan apartment.When Grace goes off to spend a weekend with her parents sister and brother in Sag Harbor Wade pays a surprise visit. With a diamond ring in his pocket he is determined to propose to Grace.But theres a hitch Grace has forgotten to tell her parents anything about Wade. She loves him but theres a snobbish fear factor about her fathers reaction. Wade stumbles and makes all the wrong moves a la Meet the Parents.Robinson is funny and appealing in the role and he has evident chemistry with the radiant Washington.S. Epatha Merkerson plays Daphne Peeples Graces warmhearted mother and Virgils loving wife. Wade and Daphne hit it off but he immediately rubs the judge the wrong way.The ensemble cast is affable and has sharp comic timing. Its a particular treat to see Diahann Carroll and Melvin Van Peebles on screen again as the less-uptight parents of Virgil.In the course of the family weekend secrets are revealed lies are exposed and Wade is continually misunderstood. When he finally faces up to the overbearing judge and challenges his controlling ways Wade stumbles even more drastically.One of the funnier scenes involves Wade ingesting some psilocybin mushrooms and freaking out during the judges public Melville reading. Its slapstick but still amusingly outlandish thanks to the actors comic talents.While billed as Tyler Perry Presents The Peeples the film is better than most of the works directed by Perry. Written and directed by Tina Gordon Chism it avoids Perrys sappy sermonizing as well as his over-the-top characters and emerges as a predictable domestic comedy with some inspired comic touches. 7 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/10v31L6Summer Movies Calendar MayTake a look at the films heading to the box office this May complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Photo Credit Nicole Rivelli advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An underachiever crashes his girlfriends family vacation hoping to impress her hard-to-please father. Rated PG-13 (language racy humor drug use) BOTTOM LINE Far from original -- try not to think about ""Meet the Parents"" -- but the likable cast and good- natured humor go a long way. CAST Craig Robinson Kerry Washington David Alan Grier LENGTH 135 In the comedy ""Peeples"" Wade Walker (Craig Robinson) is a childrens musician hoping to propose to high-powered lawyer Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) while vacationing with her family in Sag Harbor. From the start however Graces father federal judge Virgil Peeples (David Alan Grier) decides he has to undermine this unworthy slacker. The more Wade tries to prove himself the worse things go until even Grace begins wondering whether shes made the right choice. Sound familiar? ""Peeples"" is a just-this-side-of-legal knockoff of ""Meet the Parents"" altered only by minor script details and an African-American cast.

Tyler Perry produced ""Peeples"" and it bears his distinctly formulaic stamp but it isnt a completely cynical exercise. Among its saving graces are a winning performance from Grier as the relentlessly humorless Virgil and an overall generosity of spirit from writer Tina Gordon Chism (""Drumline"") making her directorial debut. ""Peeples"" is the first leading role for Robinson a breakout star of NBCs ""The Office"" who still tends toward smaller roles in comedies like ""Hot Tub Time Machine."" As Wade a freewheeling dude living an extended casual Friday hes endearing but never exactly riotous. Most of the laughs come from Grier whose displeased smirks would wither a British lord and from Malcolm Barrett as Wades brash brother Chris. The wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson best known as the no-nonsense Lt. Van Buren on NBCs ""Law amp; Order"" cuts loose as Virgils wife a former disco singer; Melvin Van Peebles and Diahann Carroll appear briefly as Grandpa and Nana Peeples. 434 VideoNewsdays 5 cant-miss summer movies ""Peeples"" introduces a gay subplot early on but handles the issue respectfully (if not exactly deftly) using it to put forth an overall message of acceptance. Thats refreshing as is the movies mostly good-natured sense of humor. Its almost enough to make you forget that youve seen the entire thing before. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT An underachiever crashes his girlfriends family vacation hoping to impress her hard-to-please father.

Director Tina Gordon Chism.Cast Craig Robinson Kerry Washington David Alan Grier.Rating PG-13 for sexual content drug material and language. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu May 9 2013 933 AM Words random together thrown sentence make read hard to. Scenes thrown together randomly make a movie hard to follow too. Reading that first sentence is what watching ""Peeples"" is like. The elements are all there. Theyre just thrown together in haphazard fashion. A funny scene here an attempt at a touching scene there toss repeat randomly the end. ""Peeples"" is a Tyler Perry-produced Tina Gordon Chism written-and-directed film about a good man named Wade Walker (Craig Robinson) who performs songs for children as a form of empowering therapy. When we first meet him he is performing his song about expressing yourself instead of urinating on people a ditty the filmmakers like so much they repeat it in various contexts throughout the movie. ""Speak it dont leak it."" ""Say it dont spray it."" That sort of thing. Wade is living in New York with Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) a beautiful lawyer for the United Nations. On the weekend that he wants to propose to her she heads off to Sag Harbor to be with her wealthy influential family for a ""Moby Dick"" celebration. After talking it over with his brother Chris (Malcolm Barrett) Wade decides to make a surprise visit and pop the question in front of her family. Bad idea. As soon as he arrives he learns that Graces notoriously intimidating father Virgil (David Alan Grier) a federal judge lives up to his reputation and then some. On the other hand her mother Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) is a free spirit and more welcoming. (As a side note When did David Alan Grier get old enough to play this kind of role? With white hair no less.) Graces genius brother Simon (Tyler James Williams) and sister Gloria (Kali Hawk) a successful cable-news reporter are also there for the festivities along with Glorias camerawoman Meg (Kimrie Lewis-Davis). The bulk of the rest of the movie finds Wade trying to fit in with largely unsuccessful results in random ways. Its not just bouncing from unrelated set piece to unrelated set piece that poses the problem; that happens in such great comedies as ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""Animal House."" Its that too many scenes cut the knees out of whatever story element was established previously. Wade makes a charming gesture at a family get-together that touches Daphne and her children. Literally in the next scene its all for naught with Wade the villain again. Robinson is a really funny actor whether in ""The Office"" or ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" or other projects. As the center of the movie here hes got a gruff charm and a sly intelligence. Too sly; it often slides past without notice. And while Wade and Virgil arent supposed to hit it off youd think Grier and Robinson would have more chemistry as rivals than they do. Another problem is that Grace sometimes treats Wade with genuine affection at other times with disdain. At one point shes so callous I kept hoping this was going to be one of those movies where circumstances open his eyes and he realizes he is better off with the woman previously unrelated to the story who is introduced by some accidental development. Ill leave it to you to see whether that happens in ""Peeples."" Although ultimately its not really worth the trouble. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Epatha Merkerson left as Daphne Peeples and Tyler James Williams as Simon Peeples in a scene from the film Tyler Perry Presents ""Peeples."" (AP Photo/Lionsgate Nicole Rivelli) Comedies about privileged princesses and unsuitable suitors come in all colors but ""Peeples"" is only palatable on a double bill with pink antacid.In his first major starring role Craig Robinson is wasted as Wade Walker an aspiring family counselor who works as a childrens party entertainer in New York. In the tradition of countless sitcoms the doughy doofus lives with a woman who is out of his league lawyer Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington).On the weekend when Wade plans to propose to her Grace has to attend a family get-together in the Hamptons. Wade is not only uninvited when he arrives at the estate to surprise Grace he discovers that he is unknown to the family patriarch stern judge Virgil Peeples (David Alan Grier). Thats just the first of many plot points that are indigestible or imbecilic in this meet-the-family fiasco. The rest of the Peeples include mama Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) a former Ramp;B star who does the worlds worst imitation of a recovering alcoholic; sister Gloria (Kali Hawk) a CNN reporter who cant break the news that shes a lesbian; and little brother Simon (Tyler James Williams) who makes YouTube rap videos featuring stacks of cash and seemingly stolen bling.And then theres the town mayor (Ana Gasteyer) who shares a naughty secret with the judge that debut director Tina Gordon Chism never adequately resolves in her choppy screenplay. With such a terrific cast (which also includes legends Melvin Van Peebles and Diahann Carroll as the grandparents and Malcolm Barrett as Wades brother) this Tyler Perry production is doubly disappointing. Instead of examining the very issues that it raises about race and class in America it stoops to sub-Sandler slapstick -- like the scene where someone gets dosed with magic mushrooms at the towns annual Moby Dick festival. If youre looking for a whale of wasted talent thar she blows.What ""Peeples""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 135  Content Sexual content drug material and mature language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(Nicole Rivelli) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 9 2013 1200 PM Title Peeples Film Info PG-13 Sexuality drugs language. Area theaters. It may be a Tyler Perry presentation but ""Peeples"" which Perry produced but does not appear in really belongs to Craig Robinson (""The Office"") and David Alan Grier. The movie might as well be called ""Meet the Peeples"" since theres no denying the comparisons to Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro as our fumbling hero and his unforgiving father-in-law. But the stars here put their own stamp on the silliness no matter how inevitably it unfolds. Robinsons Wade is an aspiring musician who currently sings songs about potty-training to toddlers. His girlfriend Grace (Kerry Washington) knows that her snobby father Judge Peeples (Grier) wont approve. But with an engagement looming Wade thinks its high time he joined the family. The question of course is whether the family -- most particularly Graces dad -- feels the same way. When Wade crashes their weekend in the Hamptons the judge is annoyed. When Wade ruins their towns annual ""Moby Dick"" celebration hes appalled. And when Wade gets caught in a compromising position with Grace hes apoplectic. But it looks as though these two men may be stuck with each other for the long haul. Washington deserves better than her two-dimensional and occasionally demeaning supporting role. But Robinsons enthusiasm never flags and Griers deadpan pomposity is a consistently amusing counterweight to the movies escalating slapstick. S. Epatha Merkerson is equally appealing as Graces good-natured mother; its a gentler role than she usually plays and she eases into it with a joyful radiance. Director Tina Gordon Chism who also wrote the screenplay seems to have relied pretty strongly on Perry for guidance. In particular she rejects any notions of subtlety either in the comedy or the weirdly heavy-handed messages about masculinity. Since the movie is also shot and edited like one of Perrys choppy perpetually underlit films the gorgeous seaside setting remains an underused afterthought. But the director also loosens things up allowing her cast to define the action rather than the other way around as is Perrys style. Just like the judge producer Perry has been a one-man show for too long; he can only improve by opening his empire to fresh perspectives and personalities. ""Peeples"" may not break any new ground but its about time Perry threw a family reunion hosted by someone other than Madea. Magic moment Graces mom revisits her glory days as a disco diva. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Tyler Perry Presents Peeples is not a Tyler Perry movie. It has no schizoid tonal shifts and no speechifying. Its morality isnt Victorian. Its sexual politics and gender roles arent regressive. It takes one of the central premises of Perrys oeuvre--that every successful black woman needs a powerful man to anchor her life--and inverts it. If Peeples had more bite it might pass for an underhanded critique of its producers work. Instead the film comes across as a gentler variation on Meet The Parents. The basic elements are there--the delayed proposal the unimpressed father a big to-do in which the protagonist embarrasses himself--but the humor is more affectionate than squirmy. Its a light and occasionally very funny movie; its critical stance--a goldmine for Perryologists--comes more from context than content. Craig Robinson stars as a childrens entertainer who shows up unannounced to the home of his live-in girlfriends family intending to propose. Upon arrival though Robinson discovers that said girlfriend a lawyer played by Kerry Washington has kept their relationship a secret because shes afraid of introducing him to her overbearing father a judge played by David Alan Grier. Robinson also meets the rest of Washingtons family her ex-disco-star mother (S. Epatha Merkerson) her nerdy brother (Tyler James Williams) and her TV journalist sister (Kali Hawk). The last also has a habit of keeping secrets from dad; shes a lesbian and the ""best friend"" she brings along to family gatherings is actually her partner. Theres nothing overtly tyrannical about Grier--hes a fussy pleated-khakis type who rarely raises his voice--but writer/director Tina Gordon Chism shows his hold over the family in other ways. Her script is perceptive about family vocabulary--the way the siblings use ""phase"" pejoratively says a lot about their upbringing--and makes good use of suggestive details like Washingtons history of dating men her fathers age. All of this probably makes Peeples sound like an ensemble drama which it isnt. For the most part the movie is a vehicle for Robinsons laidback teddy-bear charisma as well as his talent for looking extremely stoned. Over the course of the film he drinks magic-mushroom tea hallucinates in a sweat lodge and gets lost in a disco fantasy after donning one of Merkersons headdresses. These freak-outs--as well as sequences involving a bicycle race a nudist beach and an awkward dinner--threaten to turn into overlong reaction-shot-heavy set-pieces. To Chisms credit they dont; Peeples has a brisk pace that ensures that no joke overstays its welcome. Even the movies half-dozen musical numbers feel zippy. Peeples aspirations are modest Its a formulaic comedy that wants nothing more than to be funny and to present likable characters who seem like real people. For the most part it succeeds--which makes it one of the smartest and most accomplished films to emerge from under the Perry banner.

In essence the film is a cross between Meet the Parents and an Adam Sandler idiot-in-a-china-shop comedy. Craig Robinson in his first starring movie role plays the ungainly badly dressed but very sweet Wade Walker whos meeting the family of his girlfriend Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) at their majestic lakeside Sag Harbor home. The Peeples clan are so wealthy and respectable that Wade calls them ""the chocolate Kennedys."" And of course the father a dour federal judge takes an instant dislike to him. This ball-busting patriarch is played by David Alan Grier whos an inspired comic actor but in Peeples once youve chuckled at his dry disdain theres not much to the character. Grier isnt allowed to hit the highs of absurdist aggression that Robert De Niro did in the Focker comedies. Which would be fine if Robinsons Wade were cracking us up with his inappropriate behavior. But here too the film soft-pedals its vulgarity Wade never does anything too rude and most of his ""screwups"" arent really his fault (getting mistaken for a thief or gifting a bottle of wine to Graces mother who he wasnt told is a recovering alcoholic). Director Tina Gordon Chism keeps the innocuous class-meets-crass jokes bubbling and the actors are amiable but Peeples often seems to want to turn these characters into benignly goofy role models.

Long gone feel the days of complex films like Two Can Play That Game Mark Browns modern screwball comedy that provided hilarity alongside a clear-eyed critique of romantic battle. Writer-director Tina Gordon Chisms Peeples lacks the energy of Two Can Play That Game but like that picture it manages to deliver farce without compromising realism. Craig Robinson (The Office) stars as Wade Walker a musician who shows up uninvited at his girlfriends parents house for the weekend planning to win the approval of her father Virgil (David Alan Grier) and propose. (Kerry Washington plays the betrothed-to-be.) Unfortunately Wade hardly fits in with what he terms Virgils ""chocolate Kennedys"" lifestyle and the expected sparks get to flying. Peeples finds effective comedy exploring secrets underneath the familial ""perfection"" Virgil assiduously cultivates via his closeted lesbian daughter (Kali Hawk) and thieving son Simon (Tyler James Williams) a nerd who thinks he must establish thuggish bona fides and insists on being called ""Sy."" However physical comedy set pieces like an elaborate fraternity dance Virgil performs feel uninspired. Malcolm Barrett is given a plum role as Wades wacky sidekick but fails to knock it out of the park as Mike Epps or Anthony Anderson would have once done. Yet while she doesnt quite achieve the screwball zaniness she strives for Chism deserves commendation for crafting a farcical work that feels like it concerns real characters.Film Details Peeples RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time95 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Zachary Wigon Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

TWITTER Craig Robinson and Kerry Washington topline the Tyler Perry-produced film about a man meeting his girlfriends parents during a family get-together gone awry. Craig Robinson whose heightened profile on The Office has been one of the shows better developments in recent seasons steps up to topline a big-screen comedy with Peeples. His character is a hapless good guy hoping to make a good impression on his girlfriends high-achieving family. Hes a man trapped metaphorically in hostile territory much as the talented Robinson is trapped in a formulaic movie. The feature is a product of 34th Street Films Tyler Perrys specialty shingle though the specialty angle is hard to figure when the material is so broad. Built to be a crowd-pleaser Tina Gordon Chisms directing debut is sure to click with Gatsby-indifferent moviegoers when it opens wide on Friday. More leading roles for Robinson will no doubt follow and it can only be hoped that hell find better vehicles for his comedy chops. PHOTOS Bad Jokes and Surprising Successes Behind the Scenes of THRs Comics Roundtable As Wade Walker an aspiring childrens counselor whos working as an entertainer Robinson delivers exuberantly stylized musical numbers that convey bizarre educational messages He encourages kids who are long past potty training not to pee in inappropriate places. Thats one of a few loopy elements that Chism (who wrote the 2002 feature Drumline) works into her screenplay. Another is a onetime whaling communitys Moby-Dick Day celebration (dont ask). The performers are up to the wacko task. But one of the movies key problems is that it only pretends to let loose its calculated absurdity firmly tethered to the  ife lessons that lie in wait ready to wrap everything up all nice and warm. The meet-the-parents premise finds Wade ready to propose to his girlfriend of a year Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) a New York attorney who has yet to introduce him to her folks. After she takes off for an annual family get-together in the Hamptons Wade shows up uninvited determined to pop the question and charm his way into the Peeples good graces. The instant he arrives at the waterfront mansion in Sag Harbor its cookie-cutter-clear that it wont be easy for him to achieve his goal. Cue the aggressively horny dog who complicates Wades entrance -- and then conveniently disappears until plot mechanics necessitate the canines return. COMPLETE LIST The Hollywood Reporter Names 2013s 35 Most Powerful People in Media Wades No. 1 problem is Graces dad Virgil (David Alan Grier) a federal judge whos so outrageously overbearing humorless hypocritical and self-important that he might as well be wearing a sign ""About to be brought down a peg and taught a lesson or two about what really matters."" As exaggerated as Virgil is on paper and in Griers performance theres psychological logic at play Its clear why both his daughters have hesitated to reveal much about their private lives. Grace hasnt told him about Wade and Gloria (Kali Hawk) a CNN reporter is afraid to reveal the true nature of her relationship with her camerawoman (Kimrie Lewis-Davis). That its evident to everyone but her parents and siblings is one of the truths the film gets -- the false fronts and willful blindness that can define family. Virgils openhearted wife Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) might have sparked to the truth about her children but the former pop diva is busy hiding her own secret as is her son Simon (Tyler James Williams). The 16-year-old who instantly takes to Wade -- ""You sensed my swag"" -- shoots music videos in his bedroom that may not be entirely believable but theyre welcome breaks from the thoroughly unbelievable interactions among the grownups not least of which is a ridiculous subplot involving Virgil and the towns mayor (Ana Gasteyer). The films first half is a slog as Chism sets up the minefield for Wade with every (fully visible) mine certain to explode. The laughs that do register in the later going are thanks to the casts comic timing and delivery with Malcolm Barrett getting to bust some moves as Wades joker of a brother. Melvin Van Peebles and Diahann Carroll appear briefly as the predictably youthful-wise Peeples grandparents. As with much of the Perry studios output production values are not a strong suit though Rick Butlers interior design is elegant and effective. But the lighting is often flat and the widescreen format goes to waste with a good portion of the camerawork devoted to clunky back-and-forth reaction shots. Even with its autumn trees the lovely seaside locale (the Connecticut shore subs for the Long Island setting) look drab.

Griers Judge Virgil Peeples is a demanding paterfamilias who frowns mightily upon Wade (The Offices Craig Robinson)--the new beau of his daughter Grace (Kerry Washington)--for crashing a family get-together at his summer home. (The fact that Wade is a doofus who counsels kids with songs about not peeing on things doesnt help matters.) Over the course of a weekend Wade is humped by a dog burns down a sacred tepee and hallucinates on mushrooms all while Virgil steams at this interlopers bumbling attempts to ask for Graces hand in marriage and thus integrate himself into the upper-class clan. Familial secrets are eventually cast into the light (lesbianism substance abuse kleptomania) albeit via uniformly underlit and ungainly direction by Tina Gordon Chism. Still Griers comedic timing remains spot-on and his rapport with Robinson is often pleasingly prickly. But defined by Threes Company-grade humor this attempt at male-anxiety cringe-comedy is little more than a sitcom writ large that--courtesy of several awkward transitional fades to black--already feels constructed to accommodate commercial breaks.

They do a nice job of keeping racism alive right away in the movie when they have a little old Caucasian lady make ""colored boy"" references. Then they make fun of someone for battling alcoholism. Frost that cake with comedy of hallucinogenic drug use and poor relationship values.

Not the cinema of Godard or Rivette exactly but rather that specific strain of heated horny hyperactive farce that Gallic auds actually attend. Set amid the bourgeois black upper class rarely glimpsed on film and driven by the discreet charm of lead Craig Robinson writer-helmer Tina Gordon Chisms debut pic deals out generous doses of anarchic hijinks without stressing over the narrative connective tissue in between and the end product holds together just well enough. Modest B.O. beckons. Last year the Paul Rudd comedy ""Wanderlust"" was released on Blu-ray with an alternate ""bizarro"" cut that re-created the same rote plot as the theatrical cut using only deleted scenes and outtakes and its not difficult to imagine ""Peeples"" following a similar route. Hilarious bits of business and inspired goofery flow freely and effortlessly throughout the film yet even the most basic narrative devices seem to have been dragged in kicking and screaming. The pic is hardly tautly assembled but it probably could stand to be even looser as its primary pleasures all seem to be peeking into the frame from the margins photobombing the rather blase story lingering in the center. As for that story Chism makes little effort to disguise her obvious working model. Wade (Robinson) is a blue-collar childrens entertainer dating the out-of-his-league Grace Peeples (Kerry Washington) with plans to pop the question. Before he can do this however he decides to first meet her family -- described as ""the chocolate Kennedys"" -- at their palatial seaside home. Wades plans go pear-shaped rather quickly. Peeples paterfamilias Virgil (David Alan Grier) is a fusty federal judge with no intentions of making nice with his prospective son-in-law; mom Daphne (S. Epatha Merkerson) is a recovering alcoholic and former disco diva; brother Simon (Tyler James Williams) is a nerdy teen who imagines himself an R. Kelly-like lothario; and sister Gloria (Kali Hawk) is a TV reporter who has brought along her comely camerawoman (Kimrie Lewis-Davis) for mysterious reasons known only to everyone in the audience. Unlike ""Meet the Parents"" ""Peeples"" is rather unconcerned with even approximating actual human behavior en route to setting up its setpieces which often works to its benefit. Many of the films best bits arise from scenarios that are unexplained or introduced so flat-footedly that they might as well be while the most strenuously orchestrated long-lead punchlines often dissipate into sad little laughless dribbles. (At the screening attended one completely throwaway gag involving a dartboard had the audience in stitches while a go-for-broke drug freakout scene passed by with barely a whimper.) In his first leading role Robinson strikes an odd note halfway between Seth Rogen and Rodney Dangerfield but its one that clicks well within the pic and the role should help the comic deservedly move beyond supporting parts. Grier is perfectly cast as a punctilious patrician and Melvin Van Peebles who appears in a late cameo as the eldest of the Peeples clan is always a welcome sight. Save for the delightfully flighty Merkerson however the female contingent of the cast has rather skimpy material on which to chew. Though ""Peeples"" boasts the imprimatur of producer Tyler Perry it bears little resemblance to the multihyphenates own authorial projects and the films lack of shoehorned sermonizing or high camp comes as a substantial relief. Tech credits are all perfectly adequate. Film Review PeeplesReviewed at the Landmark Los Angeles May 2 2013. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 95 MIN.
