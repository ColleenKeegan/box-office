Youve become a monster sex symbol -- women will flock to theaters just to watch your buns. Most of all you have power in Hollywood. You call the shots So now you want more. In your new picture youre not interested in being a mere hero. You want to play a stud a saint a martyr a kick-ass demon. You want to be Top Gun Uber-dude. Who ya gonna call? You call Tony Scott of course. Hes the director who does for Hollywood mega-stars what Leni Riefenstahl did for Hitler transforms them from big into monumental. In the shamelessly entertaining Top Gun he made a piece of state-of-the-art Reaganite smarm that pushed Tom Cruises career into overdrive. With Beverly Hills Cop II he built an insanely flashy high-decibel shrine to Eddie Murphys ego -- it was like a James Bond flick played entirely on fast-forward. Now its Kevin Costners turn. Only this time the Scott master plan may have backfired. Revenge based on Jim Harrisons 1979 novel (with Costner serving as executive producer) is a piece of high-trash exploitation that turns ugly draggy and finally ludicrous. Its a lavishly sensationalistic Western thriller done in soft lurid colors. Scott is already famous for his work in British television commercials but now he seems to have entered some new frontier of druggy visual lyricism. Filmed in Mexico Revenge is an orgy of smoke haze and candlelight of overripe greens and browns of fabulously orchestrated shafts of light. Scott is no ordinary junkmeister -- hes turning into the Caravaggio of hacks. For about half an hour Revenge is calm and seductive as Jay Cochran (Costner) a newly retired Navy fighter pilot journeys to Puerto Vallarta to visit his friend Tibey (Anthony Quinn) a grizzled patriarch who lives on a hacienda. The two play tennis hunt quail and engage in much earnest bonding. As soon as we meet Quinn though its clear -- at least to everyone but Costner -- that this sinister grandee who looks like Aristotle Onassis and speaks in a whispery croak is not going to turn out to be a very nice guy. And the moment we spot his leggy young wife (Madeleine Stowe) and watch her eyes lock with Costners well you dont need a Ph.D. in film noir to see that these two are going to blow steam up each others nostrils and that when Quinn finds out theyre going to be in deep guano. Everything in Revenge is so archetypal and obvious that the film plays like some laughably solemn ritual. The plot turns on the tribal puritanism of Quinns character. When he discovers his wifes betrayal his punishment is so cruel -- he slashes her cheek sticks her in a whorehouse and shoots her full of heroin -- that its hard not to recoil in horror even as you realize the film is whipping up a hysterical portrait of Latino-style vengeance. Tony Scott is trying hard to do for Mexicans what Midnight Express did for Turks. He doesnt seem real crazy about women either. By the end Quinn has put Stowe through so much abuse (all of it lingered over with Scotts usual fetishistic imagery) that its impossible to separate the characters misogyny from the movies. As for Costner he gets beaten to smithereens and dumped in the desert so that he can spend the films interminable final hour trying to save Stowe and get back at Quinn. Is there anything superstars love more than grandiose masochism? (In their eyes it must seem like modesty.) Revenge turns both overwrought and dull though the actors do enliven it a bit. Sally Kirkland all cleavage and crooked smile shows up for a couple of jaw-droppingly irrelevant scenes as a man-hungry rock amp; roller. And the talented Miguel Ferrer plays a poker-faced gunslinger who conveniently materializes to help Costner carry out his vendetta. Anthony Quinn is actually quite good here. He uses his most distinctive feature -- that mouth without lips -- to create an aura of self-satisfied rot. And Madeleine Stowe is graceful and appealing even though shes mostly on hand to show off her ivory limbs and suffer like mad. Costner has a few electric moments especially when he stares down Quinns underworld cronies at the dinner table. Yet the movies somber silliness finally coheres around his presence. From first shot to last Revenge is engineered to flatter its star. Scotts camera ravishes Costner whether hes standing tall like a mythic gunslinger or humping away in the front seat of his car as he and Stowe cruise down the freeway. Even the beatings he takes are part of the mystique; by the end hes sporting the scars of a wounded demigod. The trouble with Scotts movies is that theyre not just star vehicles. Theyre about the aesthetics of celebrity about the narcissism thats going on offscreen. If Revenge ends up knocking Costner down a peg itll be just what he needs -- and deserves.

Cats amp; Dogs The Return of Kitty Galore (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Cats amp; Dogs The Return of Kitty Galore (PG) The jokes fly fast and furious along with the fur. Diggs voiced by James Marsden; Catherine voiced by Christina Applegate; and Butch voiced by Nick Nolte in Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore. Courtesy Warner Bros. Share Print Save to your profile By Christy Lemire Associated Press7/28/2010 Editor rating 3 While the dogs and cats were resourceful and well-equipped enemies in the original Cats amp; Dogs from 2001 now theyre forced to band together to fight a common foe in the sequel. As you can tell from the name The Return of Kitty Galore is a spy send-up specifically of James Bond movies -- the opening titles alone are super clever an indication of the sort of eye for detail thats in store throughout -- and from there the jokes fly fast and furious along with the fur. Surprisingly most of the gags work. As directed by Brad Peyton the sequel is a mix of live action puppetry and computer animation and the jumbled look is its chief weakness The animals are cute and all but the visual effects that suggest theyre talking too often look jumpy and fake. And of course because its a family film coming out this summer its in 3-D. It probably didnt need to be -- it never needs to be -- but at least the effects are more convincing than they were in the lousy conversion from 2-D like The Last Airbender. Theyre even more effective in the cartoon that precedes Cats amp; Dogs a new Looney Tunes offering thats old-school in spirit featuring Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner. You could probably watch those guys go at it for an hour and a half and be totally satisfied. Still its a delightful idea that cats and dogs not only enjoy a rich interior life while adults are away but also function as highly trained super spies complete with elaborate gadgetry. So you may find yourself laughing the whole way through even at a take-off on The Silence of the Lambs a film thats been parodied ad infinitum. This time the self-styled uber-villain is Kitty Galore whose hairless appearance is frightening enough. As voiced with campy menace by the great Bette Midler -- who really should do more of this sort of thing -- shes an over-the-top diabolical drama queen. But in a good way. Kitty has a plan to enslave dogs around the world and make cats the true rulers. The secret agents of DOG -- led by Lou the beagle (Neil Patrick Harris) and Butch the Anatolian shepherd (Nick Nolte) -- recruit the overeager German shepherd Diggs (James Marsden) whos been cast off the San Francisco police force for his inability to follow orders to stop her. But they soon realize they have to team up with the underground cat group MEOWS led by Catherine (Christina Applegate) and her boss the tuxedoed Tab Lazenby (Roger Moore a nice touch). Both teams get help sort of from the scatterbrained fast-talking pigeon Seamus (Katt Williams). For grown-ups kids dogs cats -- whoevers watching theres enough here to keep them entertained. Voices Nick Nolte Bette Midler Neil Patrick Harris James Marsden Roger Moore. Director Brad Peyton. Screenwriters Ron J. Friedman Steve Bencich John Requa Glenn Ficarra.

No improbable stone is left unturned as the convoluted 60s-style spy caper unfolds to present a tale of conflict between two of mankinds most popular pets. On one side we have the secret ultra-hi-tech organisation Dogs HQ and on the other the terrifying spectre of a bald pussy with plans to take over the world. You do wonder how this odious enterprise ever got the green light the script suggests it was developed on the hoof; the CGI is low grade stuff; and the human performances are loathsome. Worst of all its not even funny. Very paw.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 30 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge Of Kitty Galore Directed by Brad Peyton Screenplay by Ron J. Friedman and Steve Bencich Starring Christina Applegate Michael Clarke Duncan Neil Patrick Harris Sean Hayes James Marsden Bette Midler Nick Nolte Joe Pantoliano and Chris ODonnell Classification G In the vintage spy thriller Goldfinger Sean Connerys James Bond tames Honor Blackmans acrobatic criminal operative Pussy Galore into a compliant kitten. Movie trivia buffs may know that the films producers considered changing the Blackman characters name to Kitty Galore because of the double entendre - but more savvy marketing heads prevailed. The sanitized moniker has been scooped up by the makers of critter thriller Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore a silly family comedy in which canines and felines from rival spy agencies work together to bring down Ms. Galore (Bette Midler) a hairless Sphinx who strokes a white mouse as she plots world domination. Shot in 3D which adds nothing to the look and using a menagerie of live and animatronic creatures enhanced with CGI the flick is a sequel to a much funnier comparatively speaking family comedy from 2001. It also marks the very big-budget feature directing debut of Newfoundland-born Brad Peyton who turned heads with his sharp Canadian Film Centre short Evelyn The Cutest Evil Dead Girl. Sadly little of the dark comic sensibility from Peytons 2002 short informs this string of uninspired movie-parody cliches (including a rather sick Hannibal Lecter scene) that will have the kiddies squirming and the grown-ups nodding off. The movie sets off on a promising paw with a 007-esque opening sequence featuring a hearty version of Pinks Get the Party Started sung by Shirley Bassey ( Goldfinger) still in fine voice. But soon were wading in doo-doo. Diggs (voiced by James Marsden) is a renegade police dog who is recruited to partner with mastiff Butch (Nick Nolte) by a secret agency of spy dogs that takes the ""protecting mans best friend"" notion a little too far. They team up with a Russian Blue (Christina Applegate) from the rival cat agency and a wise-cracking pigeon with a broken wing to find Kitty Galore who lives with an inept carnie magician ( 30 Rocks Jack McBrayer trying his best). Aside from uninspired movie-parody gags Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore suffers from gadget overload. The premise that our beloved pets lead a secret life when were not around certainly has potential but rather than explore the humour that could arise from the potential human discovery of that er alternate universe the filmmakers pile on the jet packs trick collars and other technology. Dogs and cats - even fully animated 3D dogs ( Up) and cats ( Coraline) - are far funnier and more engaging when they behave like well dogs and cats. You pet owners and watchers of YouTube funny pet home videos know what Im talking about.

Starring Christina Applegate Michael Clarke Duncan Neil Patrick Harris Sean Hayes James Marsden Bette Midler Nick Nolte Joe Pantoliano Katt Williams Chris ODonnell Director Brad Peyton Release Opened Jul 30 2010  Editorial Review Hiss growl Two paws downBy Dan KoisFriday July 30 2010The best part of ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" happens before this derivative family film even begins. Its the Looney Tunes animated short ""Coyote Falls"" that precedes the movie. The 6-year-old next to me like nearly every child in the theater shrieked in delight and gasped in wonder as Wile E. Coyote was smashed flattened run over and blown up in an enormous fireball. (All in 3-D) For kids raised on the nonviolent chipper childrens entertainment of Nickelodeon and PBS Kids the first Road Runner cartoon theyve ever seen delivers genuine entertainment catharsis. Nothing so exciting happens to the audience during the main feature alas. Plagued by cheap-looking special effects and a crummy 3-D conversion ""Kitty Galore"" leans heavily on its only real asset the natural cuteness of its fuzzy stars. It also negates the one truly fun thing about 2001s ""Cats amp; Dogs"" -- the comic mileage it got out of the age-old rivalry between humankinds two favorite house pets -- with a gloppy peace-between-the-species plotline. Cats and dogs working together for the greater good? Woof. The Kitty of ""Kitty Galore"" is a hairless feline with the voice of Bette Midler who is bent natch on world domination. Opposing her are an inter-species team of super-spies a cat with the voice of Christina Applegate and two dogs Butch and Diggs (Nick Nolte and James Marsden). Butch is the old pro; Diggs is the unreliable rookie. The three are tasked with protecting a pigeon (voice of comedian Katt Williams) who has gotten hold of secret blueprints that could endanger Kittys nefarious plan. Or something. It doesnt matter. You already know everything that happens the silly plot meant to appeal to tots and the lame grown-up gags that pepper the movie drawing wan chuckles from their parents. Yes there are references to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Lethal Weapon."" Yes there are fire hydrants. Yes theres a ball of yarn thats actually a bomb. The only thing that might catch you by surprise is the waterboarding joke although the surprise is not exactly a pleasant one. Is it mindless fun for the kids in an air-conditioned environment? I guess sure but its maddening how many details in ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" are swiped wholesale from other stories. Not just from the spy thrillers to which the movie pays tribute (most ostentatiously with a debonair cat named Tab Lazenby voiced by Roger Moore) but also from other better childrens entertainment. Look its that joke about dogs playing poker that ""Up"" did better Look its the cyborg villain from ""Wallace and Gromit"" Even Seamus the motormouthed pigeon seems plucked straight from the pages of author Mo Willemss far more charming book ""Dont Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus."" And of course theres director Brad Peytons poorly choreographed action sequences which strive to match the antic heights of Looney Tunes shorts such as ""Coyote Falls."" Instead ""Kitty Galore"" just provokes the kind of headache that poor Wile E. must suffer at the end of each day.Contains animal action and humor.

Put on the dogs By Billy Heller View author archive email the author Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) July 30 2010 | 400am Modal Trigger Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) has evil in mind. Its been nine years -- or ruff-ly 63 dog years -- since ""Cats amp; Dogs"" came out to mixed reviews. About time for a sequel the filmmakers apparently thought (maybe because a whole new generation of filmgoers has been born in the interim). The result ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" is an amusing summer-confection spy send-up complete with a voice cameo from erstwhile James Bond Roger Moore as tux-clad feline spy chief Tab Lazenby. The wagging tale goes like this A creepy-looking hairless puss named Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) is scheming to rid the world of dogs and conquer the planet using a sound that will turn mans best friends into a pack of mad hounds. And she plans on sending out the sound with a satellite and secret transmitter. Thats where an unlikely band of animal allies comes into the act. A hairier than usual Nick Nolte -- OK hes playing a dog -- voices Butch the no-nonsense team leader. His partner is Diggs (James Marsden) a German shepherd just let go by the San Francisco Police Department. A wisecracking pigeon helps gather intel. Then theres Catherine (Christina Applegate) a cat Unlikely? Maybe but no more so than the Americans teaming up with enemy Russia to defeat the Germans in World War II right? ""Revenge"" offers a steady stream of puns from the ""Naked Gun"" school of filmmaking ""Weve got to stop the spread of radical feline-ism"" says one dog. Another animal mentions ""paw-to-paw combat."" We even see a tableful of dogs playing poker. The mix of actors (Jack McBrayer is the standout human as a witless carny magician) real animals puppets and computer work is seamless. And the music is a lively soundtrack of Bond- and ""Mission Impossible""-like music with a little 70s funk tossed in. With action aplenty talking animals and enough gags to make any sane grown-up groan ""The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" is a harmless but fun hot-weather diversion for the family. Oh and while it hardly seems worth mentioning the films in 3-D where available (since everything is) its worth donning the clunky glasses for the Wile E. Coyote short preceding the feature film.

"Movie review Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty GaloreThis sequel is a modest upgrade over the weak 2001 film on which its based but its not worth the ticket surcharge for the needless conversion to 3-D.July 30 2010|By Glenn Whipp Special to the Los Angeles Times The title might be ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" but you cant really talk about this OK sequel to the best-forgotten 2001 kids movie without addressing another animal a namely the elephant in the room. ""Cats amp; Dogs"" is the latest family movie to be unnecessarily converted to 3-D which means that if Mom and Dad want to take the kids to see the fur fly this weekend theyre going to probably pay a premium surcharge to receive absolutely nothing of value in return. For franchises like ""Toy Story"" and "" Shrek"" you might not be happy about the extra 4 a ticket but youre more likely to grin and bear it. For ""Cats amp; Dogs""? If there ever was a film to thumb your nose at the recent spate of 3-D ticket-gouging this is it. Save your money. Buy your pet a chew toy and wait for the DVD release. As for the movie itself it is better than the original ""Cats amp; Dogs."" But so is a rabies shot. First-time director Brad Peyton and veteran family-film screenwriters Ron J. Friedman and Steve Bencich (""Open Season"" ""Chicken Little"") have concocted a sendup of James Bond spy flicks with cats and dogs joining forces to thwart hairless cat Kitty Galore (voiced by Bette Midler) and her diabolical plans to rule the world. Bond spoofs have been done to death but the filmmakers have some fun incorporating animals into the familiar scenarios. Canine agents report to DOG headquarters while their feline counterparts clock in at MEOWS. Each agency is tricked out with nicely realized dA(c)cor such as DOG headquarters bathroom which consists of a row of fire hydrants. Midler voices Kitty with campy gusto and its kind of fun to hear Nick Noltes voice coming out of a gruff mastiff DOG agent whos paired with an over-eager German shepherd ( James Marsden). Humans take a back seat to the real animals (who are aided by hit-and-miss CGI and occasionally animatronics) with ""30 Rocks"" Jack McBrayer making the best impression as Kittys smothering magician owner. A funny new three-minute Wile E. Coyote and Roadrunner cartoon ""Coyote Falls"" precedes the picture and actually makes pretty good use of the 3-D format. The frenetic feature film meanwhile doesnt. The tot target audience will enjoy it just fine on the living-room sofa. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESShes Just Playing De Vils AdvocateNovember 12 2000You Can Talk to the Animals at Two Southland Pet ShowsDecember 12 1987Group Acts as Protector of Animal Stars in MoviesMarch 12 1987MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewMovieEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-cats-dogs-20100730,0,6498504.story",200,cats&dogstherevengeofkittygalore7,cats&dogstherevengeofkittygalore,latimes

In defiance of the laws of nature -- but adhering to movie cliches -- wisecracking cats and dogs work in tandem toward a common goal in Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore. Its not a question of whether dogs drool and cats rule. To the studios unleashing these beastly affairs 3-D is the undisputed king though audiences may regard the ubiquitous film technique to be more like an overbearing tyrant. TRAILER Get groomed on Cats amp; Dogs Though better than its 2001 predecessor -- and teeming with cute creatures and fast and furious action scenes -- the movie feels excessively formulaic. The blend of actual dogs and cats with CGI works well with a convincing illusion of moving mouths. But what the characters lack is what would seem most obvious in dogs and cats lovability. These furry guys are too frantic to deserve our emotional investment. Theyre too busy setting off explosions launching satellites or zooming around with jet packs to be man or womans best friend. Shtick abounds as do high-tech devices the go-to prop for anthropomorphized animal tales (see G Force Space Chimps Alvin and the Chipmunks). The movie kicks off with James Bond-style credits and Pinks Get the Party Started sung Shirley Bassey style by Bette Midler. The various 007 references -- and a vocal cameo by former Bond Roger Moore as a suave super-agent -- come across like a bone tossed to parents. For the kids theres Diggs a handsome German shepherd police dog (voiced by James Marsden) who bungles his duties and ends up back in the pen. The well-meaning pooch ""in and out of kennels his whole life"" is sprung by an underground (literally) corps of canine super-spies. Paired with Butch (Nick Nolte) a gruff mastiff Diggs is drafted into a covert world of dog agents that battle an equally secret operation of spy cats. Butch meets his match in a sassy kitty (is there any other kind?) a Russian Blue named Catherine (Christina Applegate). Interspecies hostility is set aside as the animals band together in combined fear and loathing for the creepy hairless Sphynx Kitty Galore (Midler) bent on world domination. The notion of pets leading a double life has been much tapped for family movies and the kid-friendly spy genre has been wrung dry. Though no one could accuse it of scrimping on gizmos and gadgets Cats amp; Dogs doesnt come close to the inventiveness of a film such as Spy Kids or the endearing humor of Babe.

And the cat days. And talking pigeon days too.In Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore a belated and entirely uncalled-for sequel to the 2001 kid comedy canines and felines (or their animatronic or CG doubles) move their mouths while Christina Applegate James Marsden Bette Midler and Nick Nolte deliver juvenile James Bond parody babble. Parents in a masochistic mood can compound the headache-inducing experience by paying extra for the 3-D version.It should be noted that in Salt Angelina Jolie goes out of her way to ensure the safety of her wee shaggy terrier before running off to deal with the CIA the Russians and the threat of global nuclear annihilation. But Cats amp; Dogs etcetera would have us believe that its the pooches and pusses who are the real spies of the world - engaged in high-tech skulduggery deploying rocket packs and Google search engines to keep mankind safe.Or to destroy mankind if youre the titular villainess. Kitty Galore (a campy-voiced Midler) is a wrinkly hairless cat with a harebrained scheme to rule the world by hijacking a satellite and unleashing a high-pitched frequency that will drive dogs mad and make them turn on their owners. To thwart her plans an uneasy alliance between MEOWS the feline spy org and DOG its canine counterpart is formed. (If these are real acronyms I missed em.) Catherine (Applegate) is the head cat. Butch (Nolte) and Diggs (Marsden) are the two shepherds - Anatolian and German - assigned to the case. But Diggs has a bad case of low self-esteem. As Cats amp; Dogs and so on opens hes been cut from the San Francisco Police Department for botching a hostage rescue. His human partner played by Chris ODonnell (yes the one-time Robin opposite George Clooneys Batman) reluctantly sends Diggs to the kennel. And so for Diggs the movie is about redemption.What Hollywood sequel isnt?And then there are Seamus the yappy pigeon (comedian Katt Williams) and Scrumptious (Elizabeth Daily) a verbose mouse held captive by Galore. In Cats amp; Dogs ya-da-ya-da interspecies interaction is through the roofWith its giant computer-equipped control centers motorcycles secret weapon dog collars and pet carrier tanks Cats amp; Dogs boasts hardware and gadgetry that would serve Agent 007 well - if he was a Jack Russell and he was doing the slapped-together shtick of a Spy Kids knockoff.If there are moments that aspire to the smart satire of the Austin Powers franchise theyre fleeting. Its hard to read nuance and irony in the mug of a beagle or a fluffy white kitty no matter how hard the trained pets puppeteers and CG animators try.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

A few minutes into a screening of ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" a child near me turned to his mother and asked ""Why is Kitty Galore called Kitty Galore?""Exactly what I was wondering. I tried to hear her whispered answer but couldnt. It was short so she probably hadnt bothered telling him that someone thought it was a good idea to name a childrens movie after a crude double-entendre in an old James Bond film or explaining what ""cynical"" means.As recently as this spring the trade papers were still calling the film ""Cats and Dogs 2"" the title it carried through eight years and at least three directors. (Brad Peyton ended up doing the honors in his feature debut.) ""Kitty Galore"" is the long-awaited much-inflated sequel to the 2001 hit ""Cats amp; Dogs"" which established the cute premise of these species locked in a secret (to humans) battle for global pet domination.The original was an innocuously charming comedy with a story built around the fate of a human family. The sequel is something much more common a bloated spy-and-action-film pastiche predicated mostly on the Bond movies but throwing in jokey references to ""Scarface"" ""The Terminator"" ""Mission Impossible"" ""The Silence of the Lambs"" ""Get Smart"" and so on.Theres a story involving a disgraced police dog recruited for the worldwide canine intelligence agency who finds himself (spoiler alert) cooperating with a slinky feline counterpart to bring down the renegade cat of the title (suavely voiced by Bette Midler). Its merely a frame on which to hang the endless old-movie gags and shaggy dog jokes. (""Hes been in and out of kennels his whole life."" ""Someones been playing catch with the ugly stick."") Photo A scene from ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore."" Credit Warner Brothers Pictures The human actors are fewer and more poorly used in the sequel. Chris ODonnell barely appears as the partner of Diggs the K-9 cop. The only two-legged performer who figures prominently in the plot (besides a pigeon voiced by Katt Williams who provides the requisite squawking-ethnic comic relief) is Jack McBrayer of ""30 Rock."" He plays a bumbling carnival magician in a series of scenes opposite a hairless cat and for perhaps the first time on screen hes not funny.A significantly larger amount of money was spent this time around on animation and puppetry to supplement the live-animal cast. Another chunk of the budget went to the post-production 3-D conversion done in South Korea (much like elective cosmetic surgery). It doesnt add much though the scenes of the animal heroes rigged with jet packs flying over San Francisco at night are enjoyably queasy-making. Advertisement Continue reading the main story There are a few other funny notions like the shot of a roomful of kitties high on catnip and blissing out to ""Get Together."" Mostly though ""Kitty Galore"" is a grind as well as proof that ""What up dog?"" isnt any funnier when a pigeon says it to a dog.""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Now along comes Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore a zippy new example of the form that exploits every cliche with abundant good cheer and an admirable unapologetic ridiculousness. Its a film about talking cats and dogs and as such it includes a fair portion of butt-sniffing jokes. Its also a sequel to a lackluster movie 2001s Cats amp; Dogs which organized stilted jokes and awkward computer effects around a lame plot involving a villainous scheme to distribute tainted fake snow to the masses. On the backs of mice. While Jeff Goldblum writhed in chains. These too are facts. But theres a ray of hope for crummy movies The sequel cant get much worse. In this case its considerably better adapting the 007 template in a story of a crazed bald cat named Kitty Galore (voiced by a hissing chichi Bette Midler) and her malevolent plot to conquer the world. Its brilliant in its simplicity really; she just needs to broadcast certain high-pitched sounds and the planets entire dog population will launch into vicious attack mode. People will have no choice but to stick them all in kennels. Kitty will then move in subduing defenseless humans. (As she puts it ""I will enslave ALL MANKIND"") Why would she do such a thing? Because her owners rejected her when she lost all her fur in a depilatory accident thats why. Cats and dogs thus unite to defeat Kitty overcoming an ancient and bitter rivalry to share classified intel and roam San Francisco for the truth. On the dog side impulsive Diggs (James Marsden) gruff mentor Butch (Nick Nolte) and smooth boss-Beagle Lou (Neil Patrick Harris) last seen as a wriggling puppy. On the cat side spy puss Catherine (Christina Applegate). The lone winged vertebrate is Katt Williams as Seamus a breathtakingly stupid pigeon. Chris ODonnell still human plays a cop. Bond references abound as well they should. The hideouts are subterranean the gizmos are awesome and Roger Moore voices a bow-tied cat named Lazenby. Theres a henchman with shiny metal teeth. The brassy music grooves and swoons over slinky opening credits and as for the climax - its almost as drawn-out and convoluted as the genre demands. Grown-ups in the audience will also enjoy clever riffs on distinctly non-Bond subjects including kitties stoned on catnip and a fluffy Persian send-up of The Silence of the Lambs in which Sean Hayes returns as the diabolical Mr. Tinkles. Directed by Brad Peyton from a screenplay by Open Season writers Ron J. Friedman and Steve Bencich Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore comes with its own pet treat a short raucous 3D Warner Bros. cartoon starring Road Runner Wile E. Coyote and a decent length of Acme Bungee Cord.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Very much the best part of ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore is the new ""Road Runner cartoon that precedes it. Its in 3-D of course and Wile E. Coyote and his eternal avian nemesis have been rendered in fleshed-out ""realistic shadings. I prefer the flat pop colors of yesteryear but in all other respects the shorts a scream fast funny impeccably timed and as brutally obedient to the laws of Looney Tunes physics as ever.The feature that follows stands to delight small children while probably causing their parents heads to cave in. In fact its safe to say that with the release of ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore civilization as we know it has ceased to exist.There may be no more James Bond movies due to MGMs ongoing financial problems but this 3-D sequel is happy to step in with a title tune sung by Dame Shirley Bassey herself a metal-toothed character named Paws and a vocal appearance by Roger Moore a.k.a. Bond No. 3. Does it really matter that the characters are domestic pets that have been digitally manipulated to talk type on computers and fly rocket jetpacks? If some of Hollywoods finest talent can sign up shouldnt we knuckle under too?Actually ""Cats amp; Dogs grafts a ""Lethal Weapon story line onto its secret-agent structure then throws in bits of ""48 Hrs. ""Silence of the Lambs ""The Terminator and other films last ripe for parody in oh 1992. James Marsden provides the voice of Diggs an enthusiastic screw-up of a German shepherd whose policeman owner (Chris ODonnell) can no longer bail him out of trouble. Its never made clear why but Diggs is recruited by the secret dog underground to team up with canine special agent Butch (Nick Nolte) on a mission to stop uber-villain Kitty Galore (Bette Midler) from world domination. Or something.Christina Applegate voices Catherine a sleek cat superspy assigned to the team (to her and Diggss disgust) and comedian Katt Williams plays a dimwitted homeboy homing pigeon -- a minstrel squab basically but the laughs are there. But who isnt in this thing? Neil Patrick Harris as a home-office beagle Moore as his feline opposite Wallace Shawn as a fraidy-cat Sean Hayes as Mr. Tinkles a serial-killer kitty trussed up a la Hannibal Lecter.Mr. Tinkles is obviously not a real critter but an animatronic stand-in -- hed fit right into an all-cat remake of Fritz Langs ""Metropolis. Other technical aspects of ""Cats amp; Dogs feel similarly grotesque The characters have been so heavily digitized to make them appear to talk and perform stunts that they no longer seem like animals but hybrid movie mutants poker-playing dogs stuck on the island of Dr. Moreau. The films 3-D is another of those awful post-production patch jobs that separate characters body parts into unconvincing pop-up-book planes.And yet . . . and yet . . . ""Cats amp; Dogs does have its lunatic entertainment value. The filmmakers dont throw away a single idea -- good bad or cretinous -- and they keep the story moving at a clip. More important they understand that if you put a sweater and a pair of glasses on a beagle well sit there mesmerized like the easily amused primates we are. ""Cats amp; Dogs is the Lolcats of movies and Im afraid its the future. I can has my culture back?Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Among other offenses the 2001 talking-animal comedy Cats amp; Dogs was a pernicious piece of anti-cat propaganda firmly siding with the canines in the eternal struggle between household pets. Never mind that cats more or less take care of themselves and spend most of the time curling up in the warmest comfiest places they can find--theyre prissy and diabolical and must be stopped. The sequel Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge Of Kitty Galore eases off on the hatefulness by providing a token nice kitty but even shes subjected to waterboarding before she can be trusted. (Yes a waterboarding joke. Because cats and dogs are just like people Soooo cute) But its still about a feline plot for world domination and the slobbering secret agents who stand in the way. And its still in the spirit of the original film an unbelievable piece of shit. Most of the problems are fundamental to the series Having real animals speak through the hideous magic of CGI is inherently creepy and its depressing to hear kitty and doggy thoughts come out so banal and jokey. Theres also the weird premise of household pets being rogue tech-heavy super-spies Whose fantasy is that? As the subtitle suggests The Revenge Of Kitty Galore expands on the James Bond theme including a voice cameo from everybodys fourth or fifth-favorite Bond Roger Moore. This time around members of a canine spy network recruit a disgraced police dog (James Marsden) to stop Kitty Galore (Bette Midler) a ""radical felinist"" who plans to unleash a sound that will cause dogs to turn on their human owners. The action plays out much like an all-human third-rate Bond thriller would only with groan-inducing puns dogs in sunglasses (cue ""Bad To The Bone"") and a visual aesthetic that could only be described as ""Hang In There""-poster-esque. The world waited nine years for Cats amp; Dogs to expand its mythology; lets hold out longer next time.

""Were the last classics"" announces one. And after a long and stubbornly marginal career heading his creative family 82-year-old director Jacques Rivette nears closing time with this commedia dellarte. Leads Sergio Castellitto and Jane Birkin have appeared for Rivette before; regular Pascal Bonitzer contributes to the script; Irina Lubtchansky taking over the cinematographers chair does proud her recently passed father William Rivettes DP of 30-odd years. The premise is skeletal Vittorio (Castellitto) an Italian passing through the Cevennes is waylaid by the mysterious wince in the gap-toothed smile of the troupes tightrope walker Kate (Birkin). Theres a breathable air of Southern late-summer afternoons in the public squares and campgrounds where Vittorio and Kate play their approach and retreat. Rivette inserts parentheticals of performers at work including a reprised routine by the clowns into which Vittorio is drawn as an incompetent substitute in a keynote scene funny and illustrative of Rivettes improvisational practice. Rivette is known if for nothing else for making epically long features; this is his shortest sidling along after the tragic secret thats kept Kate away from performing for decades. Its all slight enough to blow away and rare enough to warrant seeing it before it does. (Nick Pinkerton) (Monica 4 Playhouse)CATS AND DOGS THE REVENGE OF KITTY GALORE About as unremarkable as a film about talking animals organized into competing intelligence agencies can be Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore overcompensates for its pre-school premise (I dont know if youve heard but these house pets -- they dont like each other) with a steroidal storyline. Using a combination of live action and CGI that will give some audience members PTSD flashbacks to the recent Marmaduke (hold me) director Brad Peyton has been charged with following up the 2001 original with the sequel no one was hoping for -- in pointless 3-D. The usual pop culture allusions (Bond is lamentably spoofed; Roger Moore voices a buttoned-up cat) are meant to keep moms and dads grimly entertained but their kids will be a casualty of the overcrowded whiteboard of a plot. A hapless police dog named Diggs (James Marsden) is recruited into a doggie underground to help stop Kitty Galore (Bette Midler) a hairless cat embittered by the industrial accident that uglified her from taking over the world. A hater of both dogs and humans Kitty has gone rogue and apparently learned how to launch a satellite into space. Cats and dogs (and pigeons and Christina Applegate) must work together to deliver every pet-related groaner imaginable within 85 minutes. (Michelle Orange) (Citywide)CHARLIE ST. CLOUD In a go-nowhere Pacific Northwest town dreamy high school sailor Charlie (played mostly by Zac Efrons abs and piercing gaze) puts his Stanford scholarship plans on indefinite hold after he momentarily flatlines in a car accident which also takes his little brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). Half a decade later Charlie has sunk into a shy brooding routine as a cemetery caretaker and meets his dead bro in the woods every sunset to toss around a baseball. Adapted from a 2005 novel by Ben Sherwood this blatant heartstring-puller from director Burr Steers (Igby Goes Down) is more sentimental than subtle in depicting a grieving young man whose inability to let go has stunted him. But even at its most maudlin (enter Ray Liotta as the St. Jude-praying cancer-ridden paramedic who revived Charlie and has suddenly reconnected with him) this handsomely shot melodrama has a twist too peculiar to dismiss as some two-bit Nicholas Sparks weepie. Charlies way up from out of the drain is through the rousing flirtations of saucy redhead Tess (Amanda Crew) and simultaneously the vaguely supernatural device for our pretty-boy heros coping becomes so literal that Charlie actually bangs a spirit halfway between life and death. (Aaron Hillis) (Citywide)COUNTDOWN TO ZERO The title of Lucy Walkers pro-nuclear-disarmament tract Countdown to Zero has two meanings a paranoiacs ticking off down the last moments until the bomb goes off and an exhortation to work for the cause until zero missiles and weapons remain. Synthesizing fear and optimism like that requires Walker to be incredibly ambitious in scope and she offers up a history of the bomb and treaty talks scientific explanations a primer on how to smuggle uranium and much much more. Trying to touch however briefly on everything related to The Bomb means that inevitably much of it gets short shrift SALT I and II are barely mentioned but the Reykjavik summits failure is inexplicably highlighted. Walker runs the same old archival test footage weve seen before and interviews the big names -- Mikhail Gorbachev and Valerie Plame Wilson both make appearances -- to reiterate her already-obvious p.o.v. Shes also prone to very literal-minded exposition; to show that a tennis ball-size bomb could level a city she just throws a tennis ball up against a black screen and has it rotate ominously. This is another well-intentioned but preaching-to-the-choir doc and boring as well. Never trust a movie that ends with a moveon.org link.

Sep. 13 600pm DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS In Steve Carells first few episodes of the American version of The Office the series hewed closely to the template created by the series British mastermind Ricky Gervais. But in the United States audiences didnt take to so bleak a comic vision and soon the tone of the series evolved from harsh satire to affectionate gentle comedy. Ratings success ensued. Thats a lesson well learned by the filmmakers behind Carells new movie Dinner for Schmucks an American reworking of the 1998 French comedy Le Diner de Cons. Francis Vebers original was fundamentally on the side of the idiots. Not so Dinner for Schmucks directed by Jay Roach which takes the snobbish cruel editor of the original and turns him into Paul Rudds Tim the nicest young man youre ever likely to meet. Meanwhile bowl-cut Windbreaker-wearing Barry (Carell) is not just an unctuous bumbler but is in fact borderline mentally disabled. That is the only conclusion I can reach after watching credulous Barry gleefully smash bottles of wine against the walls of Tims apartment. Dinner for Schmucks is funny sure. How can it not be with good comic actors like Carell and Rudd -- plus Zach Galifianakis Jemaine Clement Kristen Schaal and Ron Livingston? And rest assured no American comedy is going to call itself Dinner for Schmucks without showing us the actual dinner for schmucks which is naturally this movies comic apogee. Theres a blind fencer and a ventriloquist whos married to a slutty dummy and a guy who French-kisses his vulture. Theyre all idiots or possibly mentally ill. Paramount Pictures and director Jay Roach would like to invite you to a dinner theyre hosting at which you are welcome to laugh at them. (Dan Kois) (Citywide)THE DRY LAND The dry land that we actually see in The Dry Land is the Texas dirt that James (Ryan ONan) comes home to. Strictly speaking James has returned alive but his wary squint seems stuck on the Iraqi desert he has just left. Disoriented and selectively amnesiac he cant pick up the cues to the past he left or reintegrate to small-town life which director Ryan Piers Williams gets down convincingly with his Anglo-Tejano West Texas of spread-out fragmented families. His wife (America Ferrera) notices her man isnt quite the same around the time she wakes up in a choke hold. As plot developments diligently refill James cup of sorrow -- who thinks a welcome-home job at a slaughterhouse is a good idea? -- he skips town trying to fill in blacked-out memories with a returned battle buddy (a road-worn Wilmer Valderrama) and by visiting an incapacitated friend at Walter Reed Hospital a reunion scene that turns on a dime from tentative sentimentality to almost black-comic obscenity. Such really unexpected moments are outnumbered by programmatic ones but The Dry Land does slip inside the inescapable closed-circle logic of despair and ONans shy precarious performance keeps you with him to the edge of the abyss. (Nick Pinkerton) (AMC Broadway Sunset 5)GO  GET LOW Its 1938 and Tennessee hermit Felix Bush (Robert Duvall) who has been in self-imposed exile for 40 years decides to throw himself a funeral while hes still alive to hear the speeches. He enlists Frank Quinn (Bill Murray wonderful) the nearby towns funeral director to make plans and post ads inviting people from all over to attend. For this imperfect but rewarding film screenwriters Chris Provenzano and C. Gaby Mitchell fictionalizing a true story have given Felix a guilty secret that hes ready to unburden himself of at long last during the funeral. Despite a third-act stumble in which first-time director Aaron Schneider undercuts Duvalls wrenchingly confessional monologue with awkward staging and choppy editing Get Low is a pleasure to watch. Sissy Spacek plays Mattie Felixs old girlfriend whose forgiveness he needs the most. Duvall and Spacek have three key scenes together including one that finds Felix and Mattie walking together down a wooded road. Nothing much happens; they talk and laugh and their bodies sway back and forth toward each other like young lovers courting. After a time he offers her his arm and she takes it with a firm happy clutch -- two characters two actors at ease and in joy delighting in each others magic. (Chuck Wilson) (ArcLight Hollywood Landmark)HENRI-GEORGES CLOUZOTS INFERNO Henri-Georges Clouzots Inferno is a posthumous psychodrama that according to film archivist and co-director Serge Bromberg grew out of a chance encounter in a stalled elevator with Clouzots widow. Bromberg persuaded her to give him access to a particular holy grail the surviving 15 hours of rushes and test footage from French director Clouzots abandoned would-be masterpiece Inferno. Starring Serge Reggiani and Romy Schneider Inferno was meant to portray jealousy as a form of mental illness but the real head case was its director. Clouzot was unable to finish the movie; as both the survivors interviewed and the surviving footage makes clear the attempt drove him half-mad. Inferno was an ambitious production. Clouzot prepared elaborately color-coded charts tracking his heros paranoid state. There were three separate camera crews. Columbia Pictures provided an ""unlimited budget"" much of which was spent on visual experiments involving superimpositions dappled light patterns fun-house mirror distortions and color inversion meant to convey a deranged consciousness. But rather than communicating his protagonists madness Clouzot appears to be documenting his own. Who knows how these fantastic shots of Schneider lying naked in the path of an onrushing locomotive or covered with glitter and smoking a cigarette in reverse would have played in the finished film? Who cares? For all the irrationality that fueled Clouzots project its reasonable to assume that the finished Inferno would never have been any better than this arrangement of its shards. (J. Hoberman) HUGH HEFNER PLAYBOY ACTIVIST AND REBEL Dirtbag Gene Simmons opens the film flatly stating that every man envies Hugh Hefner. Is that what I was feeling watching photo ops with frail old Hefners orange young girlfriends obligingly ""keeping him young""? Many young people know only that Hef an easy-grinning senior in leisure wear floating on a silicone sea that empties into eternity. Brigitte Bermans premature-eulogy puff-piece documentary resurrects the younger charismatically aloof Chicago-boy-made-rich in stock footage while Hefner narrates along through a lifetime of scrapbooks. The putative subject is Hefners place on the balance sheet exploiter or liberator? The peddler of mass-market decadence with a history of editorial stances -- pro-integrationist antisodomy laws -- salubrious to the Republic is a worthy topic but its bypassed for a familiar culture-wars narrative with jowly HUAC goons under every bed in the 1950s as Americans wait for the discovery of female orgasm. Pat Boone conservative radio host Dennis Prager and feminist Susan Brownmiller are there to blow against the wind of the films conviction that ""the new morality"" introduced in part by Hefner is an improvement. But Berman is mostly interested in calling hypocrisy on the other side making an example of onetime antismut crusader Charles Keating among Hefs other vanquished foes. Playboy ""gave us some of the best literature of our time"" opines noted literary critic Tony Bennett among a cast of mostly ridiculous and redundant talking heads. Hefner the old psych major wrote the script theyre reciting. ""Repression"" takes a beating along with abstracted ""Puritanism."" The inner life of the films subject however is only tactfully skimmed in passing. (Nick Pinkerton) (Nuart)GO  LIFE DURING WARTIME Daring the discomfited viewer to laugh at shame and suffering and then wonder why were laughing Todd Solondz is back. Life During Wartime shows the misanthropic moralizer as confounding and trigger-happy as ever his big clown thumb poised over a garish assortment of hot buttons -- race suicide autism sexual misery self-hatred Israel and his old favorite pedophilia. Life During Wartime is both sequel and remake to Solondzs Happiness (1998). The three Jordan sisters -- banal Trish high-strung Helen and hapless Joy -- are back albeit played by an alternate trio of actresses (Allison Janney Ally Sheedy and Shirley Henderson respectively). Trish has relocated from New Jersey to Florida where fragile little Joy arrives for a visit. Newly separated from her husband Joy is increasingly disassociated. Trish however is only a smidge chastened -- even though Happiness ended with her model husband Bill en route to prison for drugging and raping several of his son Billys fifth-grade classmates. Now Bill (Ciaran Hinds) is about to be released just as younger son Timmy (Dylan Snyder) whos been told his father is dead is preparing to become a man with a bar mitzvah speech full of quasi-religious masochistic imagery. Does the filmmaker have compassion or contempt for his characters? Is it possible to feel both? Solondzs sensibility has obvious affinities to such masters of cruelty as Neil LaBute or the Coen brothers -- but he is less smugly punitive and more obviously tormented. A humanist hes not but he does seem allergic to hypocrisy. (J. Hoberman) (Monica Playhouse Sunset 5)SPOKEN WORD Scarcely heard from since he helmed two mid-1990s indie hits (Ruby in Paradise Ulees Gold) Victor Nunez has a new family drama that plays like a musty holdover from that era. In Spoken Word poetry slams still pose as the new punk rock and the fact that men dont talk enough about their feelings remains a very fresh discovery. Cruz Montoya (Kuno Becker) is a stud on the West Coast poetry scene trading on street cred (""I want to get shot"" goes his signature refrain) and living with a foxy painter. But when he hears that his father Senior (Ruben Blades) is dying he returns to his sleepy New Mexico hometown to reckon with his Chicano roots and dance with personal demons. Like the promise of a gun introducing a fathers vintage Impala in the first act guarantees that the son will crash it in the third. Though crudely constructed (the lighting and framing are strictly soap opera) unevenly acted (Becker is a bundle of distracting tics) and bluntly scripted the film does have an honest integrity -- at least whenever Blades is on-screen. Hes not a cliched curmudgeon but rather a quietly resigned melancholic who delivers lines like theyve come to him in unpredictable waves and in the films best scene weeps as he saws through a sheath of saltines. Spoken Word remains Cruzs story but theres enough of Senior to salvage something out of all that pop psych and bad poetry.

Cats amp; Dogs Director Brady Peyton. Cast James Marsden Nick Nolte Christina Applegate. Rating PG for animal action and humor. Films with animal stars Revenge movies | Spy movies Check Cats amp; Dogs showtimes I know. I was as surprised as anyone. The idea of adorable animals (well Kitty herself is pretty ugly) ""acting"" out a movie sounds as dumb as pretty much every other movie that fits that description. Except that this time thanks to a script with enough funny references to other films and a few homegrown laughs of its own it works at times pretty well. Its like a James Bond movie acted out by house pets (the title is a Bond reference; kids ask your parents) and its better than the Timothy Dalton ones. Having Roger Moore on hand as the voice of a cat only makes it all the better. Granted its not a ""Toy Story"" movie and its not ""Inception."" But the sequel to the 2001 ""Cats amp; Dogs"" is a good-enough movie to hold the attention of both your children and you and as anyone who frequents childrens movies knows thats gold. Diggs (voice of James Marsden) is a police dog. He means well but hes pretty much a disaster because he cant follow orders. Still hes fearless and he hates cats which is enough to get him recruited by D.O.G. a secret organization of canines dedicated to the eternal war against cats (and mail carriers etc.). Hes paired with a reluctant partner Butch (Nick Nolte) to help track down Kitty Galore (Bette Midler nicely evil). But itll take help first from a pigeon names Seamus (Katt Williams) and then from - gasp - a cat. Catherine (Christina Applegate) is an agent working for P.A.W.S. the feline counterpart to D.O.G. It seems that Kitty was once a P.A.W.S. agent as well but has gone rogue and has a plot to turn humans against dogs once and for all. Its all rather silly and somewhat sweet as when the agents wander into a nice old cat ladys house where the large brood is strung out on catnip. Among the human actors who actually play humans Chris ODonnell plays Shane Diggs partner on the police force while Jack McBrayer plays the incompetent magician who owns Kitty who cant wait to be rid of him; after you see some of his tricks youll understand why. There are references aplenty to ""Silence of the Lambs"" (with a Sean Hayes-voiced cat named Mr. Tinkles in the Hannibal Lecter role) to ""Goldfinger"" and more. Most will whiz right by the target audience of kids and they wont mind a bit. At least mom and dad can share a few laughs at the winks and nods. Note Like seemingly every other film released this summer ""Cats amp; Dogs"" is available in 3-D. This irritates some people practically to distraction. I dont really have a dog in that fight as it were but theres no real reason for the added dimension here (as opposed to say ""Avatar""). So to answer the question often asked about these films No its not necessary to see it in 3-D. Plain old 2-D should work just fine. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

A sign of the apocalypse? No a concept for a sequel. Cats and dogs working together. A sign of the apocalypse? No a concept for a sequel. Nine years after ""Cats amp; Dogs"" fetched more than 200 million worldwide with its comic take on interspecies animosity Warners is unleashing ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" a faster funnier follow-up in which CGI-enhanced canines and felines effect a temporary truce to combat a common enemy. Decked out with even more impressive f/x than its predecessor -- and perhaps more important readily available in 3D -- this breakneck sequel could do nicely at the late summer box office. Much like the 2001 original the new pic imagines a world in which humans remain blissfully oblivious but dogs and cats are anthropomorphic mortal combatants armed with high-tech weaponry and space-age surveillance while locked in a secret centuries-old battle. Canines who take very very seriously their roles as mans best friends maintain a global spy network to prevent felines from re-establishing their long-ago dominance over humankind. According to the sequel however not all cats want to rule the world. (Which should come as a great surprise to most cat owners but never mind.) Indeed theres even a feline-centric superspy network known as MEOWS (Mousers Enforcing Our World Safety) thats dedicated to protecting humans. Under normal circumstances the two groups get along like well cats and dogs. But theyre forced to join forces when Kitty Galore (hilariously voiced by Bette Midler) an ex-MEOWS operative turned rogue after accidental fur loss threatens to scramble the minds of canines turn them against humans and leave mankind vulnerable to feline enslavement. Like its predecessor ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" is a live-action caper-comedy in which human actors are relatively unimportant players. Chris ODonnell the most prominent of the pics two-legged stars appears infrequently enough as a San Francisco cop to suggest his entire performance was filmed during a weekend break from ""NCIS Los Angeles."" His character exists only to provide a smidgen of backstory for his four-legged partner on the K-9 corps Diggs (voiced by James Marsden) an impetuous German Shepherd whose repeated screw-ups lead to his dishonorable discharge. Diggs is sprung from the kennel and recruited for secret agentry by Butch (aptly gruff Nick Nolte) a grizzled op who needs help sniffing out Kitty Galores whereabouts. Neither canine is eager to cooperate with Catherine (Christina Applegate) a feisty MEOWS agent whos also on the bad Kittys trail. But the natural enemies must become reluctant allies -- and also accept Seamus a jive-talking pigeon (Katt Williams) -- when ordered by their superiors eager beagle Lou (Neil Patrick Harris) and suave spymaster Tab Lazenby (Roger Moore). That last bit along with the jokey title should give a fair idea of how much the pic is intended as a spoofy homage to James Bond. The tone is set during the opening moments as ""Goldfinger"" thrush Shirley Bassey belts out a re-orchestrated version of ""Get the Party Started"" during 007-style credits. Helmer Brad Peyton and scripters Ron J. Friedman and Steve Bencich are obviously aiming to amuse grown-ups even while catering to kids and they often succeed. Real dogs and cats are effectively employed throughout most scenes and the technology used to create the illusion of moving lips and purposeful body language is impressive. The occasional appearance of obviously mechanical quadrupeds somehow is not as disruptive as it was in the 2001 original. Pic will be shown in most markets with a newly produced three-minute cartoon -- ""Coyote Falls"" featuring the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote -- that actually relies more heavily on 3D imagery. Better still its pretty doggone funny.

This isnt so much that the story and characters are weak -- though they very much are -- but that animatronics and computer animation so anthropomorphize these critters that they bear more resemblance to cartoons than actual flesh-and-fur animals. When cats and dogs not to mention a bird and a mouse dont act like animals those story and character weaknesses really stand out.Which is not to say young audiences wont embrace these critters too. CGI is so accepted now in video games and movies that these ""Cats and Dogs"" may look goofy rather than grotesque. Lets just hope no youngster returns home and flings the family feline across the lawn to see if she can fly like Kitty Galore.The movie begins with a perfectly actionable premise Its ""Spy Kids"" with critters. The opening-title sequence easily the best thing in the movie deliciously mimics those in James Bond movies. Then true to form --i?1/2i?1/2i?1/2 for early Bond films at least --i?1/2i?1/2i?1/2 theres an MI-6-like organization called DOGS determined to keep the world safe for only one kind of pet and an elite spy organization called MEOWS which challenges that assumption.But where is the Bond character? What you get for a protagonist or at least the four-legged character with the most screen time is a failed police dog a German Shepherd named Diggs (voiced by James Marsden). Only in human movie terms hes more like Inspector Clouseau.Then more than a dozen critter characters flood the screen. Theres a blunt Anatolian Shepherd Butch (Nick Nolte) a serious-minded Beagle Lou (Neil Patrick Harris) a Chinese Crested called Peek (Joe Pantoliano) -- mimicking Q from the Bond films -- and a shaggy Sheepdog Sam (Michael Clarke Duncan).The villain (Bette Midler) is a MEOWS agent gone rogue the Kitty of the title a hairless cat that didnt start off life without fur and because of that means to get her revenge. The cat heroine is Catherine (Christina Applegate gets a Katharine Hepburn tinge into her voice). Mr. Tinkles (Sean Hayes) appears mostly for a Hannibal Lecter parody as he is trussed up in his prison cell. And Roger Moore plays a tuxedo cat named Tab Lazenby a dig to the ribs of any adult who has not fallen into slumber by then.There are many more furry things but you get the idea Its a critter movie gone mad with gravity-defying animals all sorts of gizmos and not doubt a few stunts that didnt require CGI -- but who can tell which ones? For every gag that works -- a cat mixing up his pet mouse and computer mouse -- many many more fail.Canadian director Brad Peyton has his hands so full juggling animals humans and technology that he can never make any sense of an overly complicated gimmicky screenplay by Ron J. Friedman and Steve Bencich created in part as a sequel to the 2001 comedy ""Cats amp; Dogs.""What the film lacks most of all is charm. You want to love the animals in a critter movie to feel emotionally tied to them and not just root for creatures in a martial-arts dust-up.You yearn for a cat to stretch itself or a dog to roll over. Instead theyre launching satellites into space or clinging to the side of a speeding boat.Steven Posters cinematography and Rusty Smiths production design are a little too bright and silly without the subtle atmosphere of a spy thriller. Its as if the original concept a James Bond spoof with pets got forgotten once the opening titles faded away.Opens July 30 (Warner Bros.)Production companies Warner Bros.
