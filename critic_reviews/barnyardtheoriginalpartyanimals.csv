Comments Barnyard Recommended Steve Oedekerk whose screenwriting resume ranges from cult items (Kung Pow Enter the Fist) to studio projects both animated (Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius) and live-action (Bruce Almighty) wrote and directed this Nickelodeon cartoon feature about barnyard animals whooping it up while the farmers away. Its way funnier than many of the R-rated comedies Ive seen lately though Oedekerk seems to have ignored the writers edict to know your subject--most of his cows are male. The CGI is excellent with characters whose depth and solidity suggest Nick Parks clay animations. The laughs subside near the end as the requisite moral kicks in but this is still that rare kids movie Id recommend to parents and nonparents alike. With music by the North Mississippi Allstars.

Cut to frame two where one of them shouts Car and in the following frame theyre all back to grazing on all fours purely for the benefit of us humans. Thats the gist behind this half-baked CGI offering from Nickelodeon; a film that manages to say less in 90 minutes than Larson achieved in three simple panels. The film alights on a primary-coloured farmstead presided over by a chubby farmer who is blissfully unaware that his cliched collection of animals - headed by macho bull Ben - can in the best traditions of anthropomorphism all walk and talk. Bens getting on a bit though so hes priming his son Otis for leadership. But all Otis wants to do is party. Will Otis ever get his act together? Do we care? The animation here is of the plastic toy variety but thats not the real sin. The real sin is seeing a bull... with udders What the hell is that all about? Aside from a couple of successfully dark moments involving a gang of coyotes most of this fatuous film is loud raucous and dispiritingly unfunny.

Barnyard just might be the Transamerica of computer-generated family films. Its a sweet and mildly funny movie that will entertain young audiences but one aspect is utterly mystifying The two main characters father and son bovine creatures have large distracting udders. If you can get past that hurdle the movie has some funny sequences. Most notable is a chase involving one of the lead cows and his three ""Jersey"" pals who take revenge on some young brats and go ""boy-tipping."" They speed off in a car to the accompaniment of a tune that sounds suspiciously similar to The Sopranos theme. Otis (voiced by Kevin James) a fun-loving and rather prodigal son to Ben (Sam Elliott) is the unofficial barnyard leader. Ben is the animal the others rely on; he ensures the farm runs smoothly. Otis is big on practical jokes and taking risks. He organizes a rowdy party in the barn behind the farmers back. Ben makes it his business to protect the animals from invading marauders. In his last heroic effort Ben is attacked by a pack of coyotes and Otis must take over. A word of caution to parents Children unduly troubled by the deaths of Bambis mother or Simbas father in The Lion King might have a hard time with similar themes in this otherwise family-friendly movie. Otis coming of age is handled gently and engagingly. Its just odd that his physical attributes make him more like a wannabe Bessie than a fun-loving stud. A horse is a horse of course but can a bull be a cow? Posted 8/3/2006 928 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Paramount Pictures Animal house Otis voiced by Kevin James gets rolling.

"Manic maudlin Barnyard is a strange animal - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Manic maudlin Barnyard is a strange animal By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 4 2006 Speaking as both a parent and a critic I do believe Id rather drive rusty railroad spikes through my eyes than have to sit through one more computer generated family film about talking animals. The bad news for Hollywood is that after seeing ``Barnyard"" my kids feel the same way.Written and directed by Steve Oedekerk the comic mind behind ``Bruce Almighty"" and ``Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" ``Barnyard"" is nothing so much as ``The Lion King"" chewed in a cud and digitally regurgitated. Its manic and maudlin borderline creepy occasionally inspired. More often its just plain strange with the brief appearance of a character named Wild Mike a sort of break-dancing Tasmanian Devil the other farm animals keep imprisoned in a box my daughters and I looked at each other in the dark with alarm. What fresh CGI hell is this?The story concerns the coming of age of Simba -- excuse me Otis (voice of Kevin James) an irresponsible young cow whose father Ben (Sam Elliott) is the august leader of the barnyard. Ben holds the barnyard morning meetings keeps watch at night against coyotes and dispenses homilies like ``A strong man stands up for himself. A stronger man stands up for others.""Otis is having too much fun being a party animal to pay attention until the unthinkable happens and he has to step up to the plate. Can crippling guilt and the love of a pregnant heifer named Nala -- sorry Daisy (Courteney Cox) -- overcome his urge to go human-tipping with a crew of ``Sopranos""-accented Jersey cows?Im not making this up; I dont think I could without drinking a punch-bowl of Ritalin mixed with cough syrup. ``Barnyard"" gives us a shiny rather ugly world of humanoid beasties; its as if a bunch of Little Tykes toys had been given life and stroppy attitudes. There are humans here but theyre grotesque and few and the gag is that the animals have to hide from them their ability to use cellphones and drive cars. You may be willing to suspend your disbelief to buy that but youll probably stop short at the movies extremely odd notion that male cows have udders.Thats right udders. Did no one involved with this movie bother to Google the word ``bull""? Have we in fact wandered onto a top-secret genetic research station? (That would explain the rapping rat and the giant mutant chick.) Sure its a family film and no one wants to spoil the party with details but I say give the kiddies the straight anatomical dope more or less so they wont be in for a terrible surprise when they wander into a field with a milk pail some day.``Barnyard"" is not without its laughs. The cast is enthusiastic the musical numbers bizarrely catchy and Oedekerk keeps throwing animals at us the farm dog (Dom Irrera) addicted to fetching balls a wimpy rooster (Rob Paulsen) a drooling coyote (David Koechner) a neurotic ferret or fox or something (Cam Clarke). Danny Glover voices the wise old mule who might as well be named Rafiki; hes fine and Jeffrey Garcia as a smart-aleck Hispanic field mouse is the funniest thing in the movie.By contrast Wanda Sykess sassy-black-chick schtick -- she plays Daisys friend Bessy -- is way past its freshness date and so really is the whole racial profiling of CGI family flicks. Every vibrant cultural movement eventually descends into rococo excess and with ``Barnyard"" computer-generated cartoons have at last arrived at their moment. The film ends with a bovine nativity scene that would delight the camp artist Jeff Koons but this is a studio film so its played insanely straight. A strong man might weep. A stronger man might rent ``Babe"" instead.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

With a blithe disregard for anatomical correctness ""Barnyard"" offers the spectacle of male cows equipped with prominent udders while spinning an uplifting coming-of-age yarn spiked with liberal doses of madcap lunacy. Steve Oedekerks raucously funny yet warmly sentimental CG toon may perform at the low end of opening weekend B.O. expectations given its late arrival amid the current onslaught of animated entertainments. But pic is zippy enough to delight youngsters and clever enough to engage their parents. Although best known as a writer and/or director of live-action features (""Ace Ventura When Nature Calls"" ""Bruce Almighty"") Oedekerk comes to the table with ample toon credentials having scripted and produced the Oscar-nominated ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius"" (based on the Nickelodeon TV series he created) and the Imax-size ""Santa vs. the Snowman 3D."" Equally important hes the grand kahuna of the Omation Studios animation facility in San Clemente Calif. For his debut as helmer of an animated feature Oedekerk gets considerable comic mileage from the confirmation of a suspicion long held by many (if not most) pet owners While humans are away animals walk (on two legs) and talk sing dance and party hearty. In the world according to ""Barnyard"" all the critters who inhabit the bucolic farm of a clueless farmer are exuberantly anthropomorphic. Indeed it seems theres only one really serious quadruped (who of course is secretly a biped) on the entire spread Ben the Cow (voiced by Sam Elliott) the acknowledged leader and vigilant protector of the animal population. At night as the farmer blissfully slumbers Ben keeps watch for marauding coyotes while the other animals -- including Otis (Kevin James) Bens gleefully irresponsible son -- whoop it up. Among the other party animals Miles (Danny Glover) a sage mule whos not too old to shake a hoof; Pip (Jeff Garcia) a hyperactive mouse; Freddy (Cam Clarke) a high-strung ferret whos hard-pressed to resist tasty chickens like Etta (Andie MacDowell); and Pig (Tino Insana) who is well a pig. Newly arrived is Daisy (Courteney Cox) a recently widowed and very pregnant cow who lost her entire family after a sudden storm. Otis always changes the subject when his father talks about ""responsibility"" and ""maturity."" But when Ben is no longer able to guard the farm against the depredations of Dag the Coyote (David Koechner) and his companions Otis is forced to grow up fast and heed his fathers motto ""A strong man stands up for himself; a stronger man stands up for others."" The vocal performers are exceptionally well cast across the board. Elliott effortlessly conveys both grizzled authority and paternal concern. (He also does a respectable job of singing Tom Pettys ""I Wont Back Down"" one of several aptly chosen pop tunes on the soundtrack.) James Cox and Glover are also standouts while Koechner makes a memorable impression as arguably the scariest toon villain since Scar spooked ""The Lion King."" Even in this age when CGI toons are commonplace the Omation computer-generated 3-D imagery in ""Barnyard"" is pretty doggone spectacular. As often is the case some of the biggest laughs are generated by throwaway marginalia. (A dance line of horses is billed as ""Lord of the Hoof"" while chickens toss darts at a photo of Col. Sanders.) But its the fluid and flexible movements of the imaginatively and amusingly detailed creatures that really hold interest. A few parents may resent being asked by their puzzled children about those prominent udders. Other parents may be upset by the genuinely scary depiction of the hungry coyotes who often appear like bit players from the ""Howling"" horror franchise. Product placement spotters will note the plug for Pars upcoming barnyard live-actioner ""Charlottes Web.""

"The Family Filmgoer washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Family Filmgoer Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jane Horwitz Friday August 4 2006 Barnyard (PG 83 minutes) Kids 8 and older may laugh now and again at this ill-conceived animated comic fable about barnyard animals who party like frat boys when the farmer isnt looking but it surely doesnt earn the laughs through good storytelling or beautiful animation. Parents may find themselves trying to explain why key characters in ""Barnyard"" are milk cows with udders who are supposedly male. And since the animals walk on two legs when the farmer isnt around those udders on male ""cows"" with male voices look even weirder. The villain is the main reason for the 8-and-older age recommendation -- a snarling cadaverous yellow-eyed coyote who steals chickens kills a cow and threatens worse until the bovine hero stands up to him. Confrontations with Dag (voice of David Koechner) and his coyote gang are not graphic or bloody but are quite violently portrayed with animals hurled against trees. The reluctant hero Otis (Kevin James) is a party-loving cow who loses his father Ben (Sam Elliott) to a coyote attack. The film includes mildly crude animal-centric humor and occasionally gratuitous sexual innuendo. A human police officers remark about strip-searching teenage joy riders is bizarre though most younger kids wont get it. A human teenager (a runny-nosed cow-tipping bully) is shown with his behind partly exposed. There is talk of a pregnant female cow in labor. Otis and his pals go joy riding in a car chugging bottles of milk. ""Barnyard"" is a coming-of-age tale in which Otis learns how to fill his dads hoof prints as protector of his fellow farm animals and earn the love of the new cow Daisy (Courteney Cox). Alas neither the preachy message nor Otiss funny mouse pal Pip (Jeffrey Garcia) nor his wise donkey mentor Miles (Danny Glover) can save ""Barnyard."" ALSO PLAYING 8 and Older ""The Ant Bully"" (PG). Occasionally very intense computer-animated fable about a friendless boy (voice of Zach Tyler Eisen) who gets bullied and takes out his anger on an anthill nearly drowning the ant city in a garden-hose tsunami (a scary moment shown from ants point of view); ants sneak into his room and slip him a potion mixed by their wizard (Nicolas Cage) which shrinks the boy to ant size; they take him to their world; their queen (Meryl Streep) declares he must learn ant ways; a kindly ant (Julia Roberts) teaches him; he learns courage selflessness empathy. Some under-8s may be unfazed but others may cringe during action bits including a wasp attack a frog that swallows ant-sized boy and a battle with the exterminator (Paul Giamatti); toilet humor; penis/gender joke; visual ""plumbers butt"" gag. ""Monster House"" (PG). Terrific truly scary animated creep show for kids 12-year-old DJ (Mitchel Musso) spies on the rundown house across the street believing cantankerous owner (Steve Buscemi) and his house swallow up kids and others who venture onto his lawn; DJ and his pal (Sam Lerner) and a new girl (Spencer Locke) go in after Chowders lost basketball and solve the mystery dangerous though it seems. House growls roars belches smoke has creeping shadows a hall runner that acts like a tongue to snatch people up a crypt-like cellar; yet scariest scene is a human one -- the owner seems to have a fatal seizure while holding DJ in his grip screaming at him; witty script contains mild sexual innuendo including references to puberty; gross toilet humor; references to beer. Plot giveaways The owner survives; climax is a kind of secular exorcism. Too scary for under-8s some older kids. PG-13s and an Unrated Film ""Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" (PG-13). Will Ferrell as a dim stock car driver in broad often funny sendup of NASCAR culture which some may find condescending; film shows Ricky Bobbys blue-collar childhood his reprobate dad (Gary Cole) his early wins his crash/loss to a snooty French driver (Sacha Baron Cohen) subsequent fear of driving loss of pal (John C. Reilly) and trophy wife (Leslie Bibb) and eventual redemption. Crude sexual innuendo and slang; lewd comedic references to erections male parts animal sexuality; implied toplessness; talk of posing for porn magazines; homoerotic innuendo; homophobic slurs; midrange profanity; stronger profanity partly muffled; characters drink smoke; references to selling using illegal drugs; crazy driving crashes including a preschooler taking a joy ride; comedic violence shows arm broken mountain lion pouncing Ricky sticking a knife into his own thigh. Not for middle schoolers. ""Wondrous Oblivion"" (Unrated). Heartwarming atmospheric tale of friendship across racial religious cultural barriers in 1960s London about cricket-loving son (Sam Smith) of Jewish immigrants and his friendship with Jamaican neighbors in a grim anti-immigrant blue collar district; the Jamaican patriarch Dennis (Delroy Lindo in a lovely turn) coaches him in cricket while his daughter (Leonie Elliott) and the boy become fast friends; the boys parents are nervous but his mother (Emily Woof) married to a workaholic older man (Stanley Townsend) is drawn to Dennis; the friendship though fraught with near-disaster survives. Hate-fueled vandalism; racial ethnic slurs; rare profanity; drinking smoking; steamy kiss; sexual innuendo. High schoolers. ""John Tucker Must Die"" (PG-13). Crass mean-spirited poorly acted teen comedy glorifies teen sexual gamesmanship; three high school hotties (Ashanti Sophia Bush and Arielle Kebbel) learn theyre all being two-timed by the same jock (Jesse Metcalfe); they enlist a new girl (Brittany Snow) to enthrall and humiliate him with their help. No graphic sexual situations but much leering sexual innuendo -- jokes about erections genital herpes; toilet humor; occasional profanity; seminudity (plus a thong). Dubious fare for middle schoolers. ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest"" (PG-13). Frequently diverting funny-scary sequel is far too long confoundingly plotted; Johnny Depp keeps production afloat as pirate Capt. Jack Sparrow the drunken charmer with golden luck this time pursued by ghostly squid-faced lord of the deep Davy Jones (Bill Nighy); Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley as lovers from first film also seek out Sparrow. Nongraphic swordfights a stabbing a whipping (bloodied back shown); subtle remark about sexual passion; joke implying a man is a eunuch; cool-but-gross imagery of Davy Joness un-dead pirates their decaying bodies crusted with sea creatures; Sparrow munches on a severed hand while a captive of cannibals; crows peck out prisoners eyeballs (mostly sound effects); monster squid attacks ships snatches men; mans false eye pops out; ghost pirates conch-shell head falls off sprouts crab legs; beating heart lives outside a body; rum guzzled. Iffy for preteens grade schoolers. Rs ""The Night Listener."" Moody intriguing but disappointingly ambiguous tale based on Armistead Maupins reality-based novel stars a somber Robin Williams as late-night radio storyteller who recounts to listeners his sadness at breaking up with his lover (Bobby Cannavale) and how it prompted him to dig deeper into his correspondence with a sickly teenager (Rory Culkin) who was sexually abused and his adoptive mother (Toni Collette); he suspects the boy may not exist and the woman is pretending to be him on the phone and in letters so he flies to Wisconsin to find out. Strong profanity; ethnic homophobic slurs; flashbacks subtly implying sexual abuse of children; marijuana. 17 and older. ""Little Miss Sunshine."" Priceless off-center adult comedy -- wonderfully acted and directed -- about dysfunctional American family whose angst is mitigated by affection; the dad (Greg Kinnear) is a failed motivational speaker; his dad (Alan Arkin) is a heroin-snorting sex-obsessed profane senior citizen; his wife (Toni Collette) is stressed out; her brother (Steve Carell) is a suicidal gay college professor; their teenage son (Paul Dano) is silent; their still-happy daughter (Abigail Breslin) longs to be in a creepy little-girl beauty pageant; they all pile into an also-dysfunctional VW van to get her there. Strong profanity sexual language; porn magazine covers; drug use; professor admits he was in love with a student; homophobic slurs; issues of loss grief. 17 and older. ""Miami Vice."" Slick update of 1980s TV show looks good but feels padded and dull between gun battles; confounding plot has undercover cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx) posing as movers of contraband in sting designed to bring down drug cartel; Sonny falls for bad guys financial whiz (Gong Li) while the less existentially tortured Tubbs has a cop sweetheart (Naomie Harris). Deafening sometimes very bloody gunplay bone-breaking fights; explicit sexual situations with partial nudity; milder sexual innuendo; profanity; drinking smoking. 16 and older.

When the farmers away he and his critter buds throw jamborees in the barn and go surfing down a cliff atop a block of ice. This is when the toons at its jolliest. At other times as coyotes lurk nearby and Otis (at the behest of his gray-cow dad) sluggishly learns how to be a ""strong man"" it feels like Barnyard swipes too much of its plot from The Lion King.
