Adams himself struggled for years to bring his story to the screen and its only now - four years after his premature death aged 49 - that his ambition has finally been realised by Hollywood. Thankfully though its not all Hollywood and no Adams. Sure the cast includes Sam Rockwell (doing a good Dubya impression) John Malkovich Zooey Deschanel and Mos Def - but the choice of Martin Freeman (The Office) as the reluctant space-traveller Arthur Dent roots the film firmly in its original and unmistakeably British tradition. Homegrown too is director Garth Jennings who forms half of Hammer and Tongs - one of Londons more original music promo and ad production outfits. Jennings involvement has resulted in a film that is rich in visual invention and playfulness. His choice of fellow creatives Shynola to animate the pronouncements of the Guide itself (to the weighty voice of Stephen Fry) is particularly inspired.We begin on Earth where both Dents house and the entire planet are scheduled for demolition. Luckily for Dent his alien friend Ford Prefect (a manic Mos Def) is there to aid his escape so beginning a rapid journey through Adams imagination to Zaphod Beebleboxs (Rockwell) spaceship Humma Kavulas (Malkovich) handkerchief-worshipping planet Slartibartfasts (Bill Nighy) planet-construction factory and some brilliantly designed slothful and bureaucratic Vogons. Its a bit frenetic and cluttered and it sometimes feels like a whirlwind tour of Adams ideas during which were not allowed to get off take a breather and savour the view. Some dialogue is even garbled and incomprehensible. Still all is forgiven during the films moments of comic or visual brilliance such as the pronouncements of super-computer Deep Thought to a crowd wearing T-shirts bearing the slogan Think deep or when a sperm whale falls from the sky and considers the meaning of life. Its not slick - and thats a good thing. Rather its like a fun and daring scrapbook - intermittently interesting but always inspired.

And for them (or should I say for us) the appearance of the movie version of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (as opposed to the original 1978 BBC radio version followed by the 1979 book version the 1981 BBC television version and the 1984 videogame version) four years after Adams death of a heart attack at the age of 49 is like an eerie time-warped greeting from a distant galaxy The thing feels sweetly familiar but a bit frayed around the heat shields as it re-enters our atmosphere. For all others the nutty fitfully charming production with its Pee-wees Playhouse visual aesthetic androidish pacing and idiot-proof overdelight in itself may bemuse rather than cause a powerful disturbance in the force. Here again is Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman quintessential drone from the BBCs The Office now playing a quintessential blinkered Englishman who is cousin in obliviousness to Shaun in Shaun of the Dead) whose house is about to be bulldozed for the creation of an English freeway. Arthur is rescued moments before Earth itself is bulldozed by his pal Ford Prefect (Mos Def) who turns out to be not-so-carbon-based after all hailing from a planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse. Simply by sticking out his thumb to snag a ride on a passing spaceship Ford introduces his human friend to the secrets of a really really big cosmos that bears a hilarious resemblance to everyday earthly life with a few modifications. Among them The president of the galaxy (a hyperdriven Sam Rockwell) has two heads; the sour-tempered civil servants who jam the bureaucracy are lumpish pickle-skinned creatures (created by Jim Hensons Creature Shop) from the planet Vogosphere; and the smartest creatures in the universe arent the humans who perform experiments on mice but rather -- well stick around and listen to dolphins sing ""So long and thanks for all the fish."" Actually that polite sentiment (another key bit of Hitchhiker philosophy) orchestrated and choreographed in an opening number suitable for the extended cut of The Wizard of Oz represents director (and music-video jokester) Garth Jennings at his best before hes tripped up by the challenge of squishing in so much other Adams arcana. Anyhow as often happens in such cult-hip enterprises the devoted cast is inspired to flights of thespian bravura. Among the standouts Alan Rickman conveys true banal sad-sackery as the voice of a depressed robot. Bill Nighy is characteristically divine as a planetary construction engineer. And in an exquisitely loony subplot new for the movie John Malkovich outdoes himself as the leader of a religious cult devoted to the worship of a giant nose -- a spiritual movement that sums up the intersection of the improbable and the mundane where Hitchhikers feel most at home.

"Hitchhiker Tom Thumb washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Hitchhiker Tom Thumb Martin Freeman left Sam Rockwell Mos Def and Zooey Deschanel help propel ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" but it ultimately runs out of fuel. (By Laurie Sparham -- Touchstone Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Teresa Wiltz Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 29 2005 As bad days go this one starts out exceedingly awful. Every-Earthman Arthur Dent ""ape descendant"" and hapless in matters of the heart awakens to the sight of an army of bulldozers queuing up in the front yard. His house unbeknown to him has been scheduled for demolition. Bad bad bad news. Except as Arthur stretches out in front of the bulldozers his best friend Ford Prefect delivers even worse news Not only is Arthurs house being mowed over to make way for a highway but so is like the entire planet . Right now. Well okay they do have time for a quick pint. Oh and by the way Ford is an alien. And . . . according to ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" the only way for Arthur and Ford to protect their heinies from instant annihilation is to stick out a thumb and hitch a ride with the next spaceship thats getting the hell out of Dodge. So begins ""Hitchhiker"" the widely anticipated screen adaptation of the late Douglas Adamss loopily eccentric radio series/novel/play/computer game/TV miniseries/comic book of the same name. The screenplay was written by Adams and Karey Kirkpatrick (""Chicken Run"") and the film was directed by Garth Jennings. And as beginnings go its rip-roaring spot-on hoot-out-loud fun. We were so busy hooting out loud and ripping and roaring that it took a minute for us to realize that although ""Hitchhiker"" starts out a total gas it doesnt have enough fuel to sustain the ride ultimately amounting to little more than some amusing gags strung together in search of a story. Which is a bummer. It has all the right ingredients It has a charming cast with Martin Freeman (star of BBCs ""The Office"") as the befuddled Arthur and rapper/renaissance man Mos Def as the quirky Ford. Also on board are a nearly unrecognizable Sam Rockwell (""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"") as the whos-your-daddyesque Zaphod Beeblebrox president of the galaxy; John Malkovich -- with hair -- as the oleaginous preacher Humma Kavula; the veddy proper Alan Rickman as the voice of Marvin the whiny clinically depressed robot (who is actually played by Warwick Davis); and a winsome Zooey Deschanel as the adventure-loving Trillian who finds out much to her dismay that space could be her permanent home what with Earth being destroyed and all. So it has all these fine actors doing some very fine acting (lets take a moment to worship at the altar of the outrageously gifted Mos Def) some really fun bits with an animated e-book (""The Guide"" wonderfully voiced by an arch Stephen Fry which advises readers ""DONT PANIC"") and some hilarious riffs on the Infinite Improbability Drive coming into contact with among other things a ball of yarn. (The result Yarn people Okay you really had to be there to get that bit . . . .) It has all this good stuff fun special effects such as Zaphods literal two-facedness and the hideously ugly villainous Vogons spouting really bad poetry. But what it doesnt have is a discernible plot. As Ford and Arthur careen through space sneaking onto and getting kicked out of a series of spaceships story lines are picked up like the importance of a good bath towel or Kavulas quest for the point-of-view gun only to be dropped with a quickness. Its a little bit sci-fi a little bit satire a little bit philosophical a lot anarchistic -- much like we are told its author the British-born Adams who worked for 20 years on the screenplay before dying of a heart attack in 2001. But coherent its not. And that for both Hitchhiker fans and Hitchhiker newbies is a shame. Unless that is youve consumed massive quantities of Zaphods Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster -- purportedly the best drink in the universe -- the effect of which leaves one feeling as though ones brain has been smashed by a slice of lemon wrapped around a giant gold brick. And then maybe you wouldnt mind the madness. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 and contains adult themes cartoony violence and mild profanity.

If a certain spottiness makes this a tough call the movie probably is on beam often enough to keep Douglas Adams enthusiasts from wanting to blast its negative into outer space. Alien journalist Ford Prefect (Mos Def) left hapless earthling Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) President Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell). Touchstone Pictures This sounds like lukewarm praise -- and it is. But its still saying something because the book cannot have been the easiest material to finesse despite its successful history on BBC radio and later on TV (just out on DVD). A beloved cult tome of cheeky asides whose frail storytelling charm lies in Adams writing Galaxy also is that rare celestial saga that you sense will end more or less happily even though it begins with the destruction of Earth. (Related video Watch the Hitchhikers trailer) Before this happens hero-of-sorts Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is worried about more piffling things -- like the imminent destruction of his home in rural England to make way for a freeway. Less ruffled is Arthurs best friend (Mos Def) who knows the whole planet is about to go up. And he has this inside info because well hes an alien -- just the guy to whisk Arthur onto a spaceship owned by Vogons the race of super-uglies stupidly behind the ka-boom. About the movie Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy   1/2 (out of four) Stars Martin Freeman Mos Def Sam Rockwell Zooey Deschanel Warwick Davis Bill Nighy Director Garth Jennings Distributor Touchstone Rated PG for thematic elements action and mild language Expands Friday nationwide So what ensues? Well there are more hairs-breadth escapes in this episodic yarn and a love triangle of sorts. It involves Arthur another displaced earthling (Zooey Deschanel) and the galaxys president Zaphod Beeblebrox played by Sam Rockwell (doing his usual nut case this time with two heads and an extra hand). There are also the Vogons themselves impressively though yuckily designed by Jim Hensons Creature Shop. They couldnt get a date with a hippo. Its hard to escape the feeling that the movie is overstuffed sometimes even with goodies. Its tough to fault a funny android with the voice of Alan Rickman -- sort of like what its Star Wars counterpoints would be were they in serious need of analysis. And the animation sequences that illustrate the instructional Guide itself are clever. Though the journey ends on some fun notes after a sagging middle Galaxy never fully breaks out. The comparative acid tests are the past movies (and brand of humor) it brings to mind. Most of the Monty Python pics are more consistent and last years still under-valued Shaun of the Dead (in which Freeman had a role) outstrips this effort in bona fide howls 10-1. Yet every time youre about to give up on this movie something verbally or visually witty injects a new dose of fuel. Galaxy is finally good enough to keep you rooting for it but the mode of transport needs fresher points and plugs.

Starring Martin Freeman Mos Def Zooey Deschanel and Sam Rockwell. Directed by Garth Jennings. (PG. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" could not have been an easy movie to make. Even aside from the technical challenges of bringing a science fiction universe to the screen theres the problem of a story that doesnt quite cohere. The characters change their goals from scene to scene and the only thing that holds the movie together is the dazzle of individual episodes. If this dazzle were merely technological the movie would start unraveling after an amusing 45 minutes. But it doesnt. The movie hangs together and gets by with more than a margin of goodwill because the dazzle it offers is one of the mind. And although everyone connected with the film deserves credit including director Garth Jennings the mind that we unquestionably encounter in ""Hitchikers"" is that of Douglas Adams the late sci-fi author and creator of the ""Hitchhiker"" series. Its a singular consciousness -- wildly imaginative humane playful and deflating of all pretense. Audiences will be won over from the first sequence in which dolphins keep trying to warn humans that the Earth is about to be demolished. Finally they give up and leave the earth saying ""So long and thanks for all the fish"" which becomes the title of the old-time music hall number that runs under the credits. Its the end of the world and no one knows it. The earth is about to be obliterated to make way for an intergalactic superhighway but in the meantime everyone goes about their mundane concerns including Arthur (Martin Freeman of the BBCS ""The Office""). Arthur a brooding sensitive soul becomes one of the lucky ones when his friend Ford (Mos Def) secretly an alien arranges for them to be lifted up to a spaceship seconds before the big bang. In the course of their travels they run into Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) whom Arthur once tried to pick up and her new boyfriend Zaphod (Sam Rockwell) the flamboyant and utterly superficial president of the galaxy. Zaphod is scouring the galaxy for the secret of the universe but thats just the movies transparently flimsy pretext for keeping the story in motion. In ""Hitchhikers"" its not about the big picture and its not about wondering how it will end. Its about the moment-to-moment. In several episodes the crew encounters Vogons heavy lumbering space citizens who are not evil just bureaucratic and bad tempered. (""They have no imagination"" Ford explains. ""They just run things."") Unencumbered by any need to be plausible the movie shifts gears and changes locations seemingly at will but theres always something to see and enjoy along the way. In the most visually elaborate sequence Arthur gets a tour of a tremendous factory floor where whole planets are custom-made. Martin Freeman as an intelligent skeptical everyman makes a likable surrogate for the audience. Hes an easy fellow to root for though his combination of stammering and shy sniping in his scenes with Deschanel does wear out its welcome. Deschanel with her offbeat delivery and otherworldly blue eyes make her an ideal mock sci-fi heroine and Mos Def -- a rapper who doesnt need to be cool all the time -- rightly abandons himself to silliness. Speaking of abandon something about playing Chuck Barris must have unlocked Rockwell because he plays Zaphod with the freedom and spontaneity of a comic pro. In a topical touch Zaphod is used for a few gentle jabs at George W. Bush. Familiar voices appear throughout. Stephen Fry narrates and Helen Mirren is the voice of the oracle known as Deep Thought. The one voice most viewers will recognize is that of Alan Rickman unmistakable as the chronically depressed Marvin an overly intelligent robot cursed with a human personality.

"Hitch a Ride Into the Galaxy washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Hitch a Ride Into the Galaxy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 29 2005 I HAVE TWO WORDS for fans of ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" at least the ones worrying how the movie version will fare given its inspired (and hallowed) source materials -- the wonderful television miniseries radio series and the five-book ""trilogy"" all created by Douglas Adams. Dont panic . For the uninitiated ""dont panic"" are the words that greet readers of the Hitchhikers Guide an extremely popular intergalactic handbook for travelers of the starry hugeness known as the universe. Its the repository of everything known and recorded. And the hapless Arthur Dent (played by Martin Freeman of the BBC series ""The Office"") finds it very useful to answer the baffling array of questions that befall him as he takes a rather involuntary journey across the galaxy. Why involuntary? Because the Englishmans planet known as Earth (""Mostly harmless"" says the guidebook) has just been obliterated to make way for an intergalactic superhighway. Moments before that apocalyptic explosion (perhaps we should mention this is a comedy eh?) Arthurs friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) has managed to hitch a ride for both of them on a passing spaceship of Vogons (nasty bureaucratic creatures who love reciting really bad poetry.) Ford it turns out is really an alien and not as he previously claimed a resident of Guildford England. (That accent never quite sounded right.) This friendship certainly came in useful Ford knew all along about Earths fate and had Arthurs back. This is just the beginning of a massively epic and wonderfully improbable trip that includes visits to other spaceships and planets as well as travel by means of the Infinite Improbability Drive which takes them through a near infinity of physical changes. (At one point they are temporarily sofas.) Arthur and Ford will meet a bevy of oddball characters including the preening dim-witted two-headed president of the galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell); the eternally depressed robot Marvin (voiced by a hilariously misanthropic Alan Rickman); an extremely bizarre quasi-spiritual leader named Humma Kavula (John Malkovich); and a sort of planet construction engineer known as Slartibartfast (Bill Nighy). Given the fact that a quintessentially British show-book-franchise has been peopled with Brits and Americans and spearheaded by a Hollywood studio this is more than a pleasant surprise. Adams died of a heart attack in 2001 but not before he had managed to write a second draft of the movie script. Karey Kirkpatrick who scripted the very amusing ""Chicken Run"" and director Garth Jennings have not only faithfully conveyed Adamss spirit but they have also added respectable flourishes of their own. There is an opening musical number involving dolphins which brings the audience into the movie with a delicious whimsicality. The extraterrestrial sets are brilliantly conceived. The narration by Stephen Fry is perfect. And the actors particularly Mos Def and Nighy take their roles and streak across the galaxies with them. Rockwell is a tickle too as the addled leader whose comment ""you cant be president with a whole brain"" could resonate for just about any political sensibility. There are at least two things however that will disappoint most fans of the original books and series The original elements have been trimmed in places and redistributed as if the screenplay itself had been put through the Infinite Improbability Drive. There are great bits and pieces of Adamss humor but theyre not always in the places you remember. And in the movies worst (and non-Adamsy) element -- which one assumes was shoe-horned in by studio Vogons -- Arthurs journey is bookended with a romance with Trish McMillan (Zooey Deschanel) a fellow earthling Arthur meets at a party just before the big bang. But perhaps thats a good thing. After all this is a movie about improbability randomness and absurdity. It almost goes without saying you cant get in a panic about having everything. THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (PG 110 minutes) -- Contains some sophisticated thematic elements and minor strong language. Area theaters.

"The Hitchhikers Guide not earth-shattering. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Hitchhikers Guide not earth-shattering. The Hitchhikers Guide not earth-shattering. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 28 2005 423 PM Dont Panic The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is smart if not earth-shattering fun. By David Edelstein A quiet ride If youve been feeling bludgeoned by the cults of J.R.R. Tolkien and G.W. Lucas youll find the cult of Douglas Adams a happy tonic. Adams pithy 1979 novel The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is like Star Wars rewritten by P.G. Wodehouse with a liberal dose of Monty Python. (There are of course some physics and philosophy folded into the mix but its nothing you need to worry about unless youre writing a doctoral thesis and/or have a lot of time on your hands.) Hitchhikers is above all a quintessential English comedy of understatement in which the more cosmic the scale the more niggling the complaints. Getting a proper cup of tea getting past an ossified bureaucrat who wont budge without a form of the proper color getting through (with a fixed smile) an excruciating poetry reading. ... No matter their shape language or number of eyes these antagonists are terribly English. What gives the story some emotional heft is the compulsion of its ordinary-bloke protagonist Arthur Dent to say ""Sir I exist"" to a disorderly indifferent universe. Adams wrote Hitchhikers first as a radio play but its a natural movie too--for English actors steeped in Englands unshakable tolerance for absurdity. Hollywood is another kettle of kippers. And there was the rub for poor Adams who always dreamed of seeing Hitchhikers on the big screen. English film executives didnt have the money and American film executives didnt get the joke--or if they got it didnt think the American multiplex crowd would go along. Lost in what must have seemed a universe of Vogons masquerading as hipsters Adams died (at the age of 49) before seeing the green light. Advertisement The project that survived him The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy (Disney) is an extremely pleasant consistently amusing diversion that is never as uproarious as you might hope. But dont panic as the Guide would say. In a pinch it will do. With a screenplay credited to Adams and Karey Kirkpatrick (who pruned embellished and reshaped Adams original script) the picture opens with narration by ""the Guide"" Stephen Fry--the perfect voice with a Wildean fatalism about the ridiculousness of it all. One of the filmmakers best moves is to illustrate Frys galactic history lessons with elegant little instruction-manual cartoons and to end the overture with a lyrical vision of dolphins rising up into space to the cheerful ditty ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish""--the title of a Hitchhikers sequel and the catchiest number of its kind since the Pythons ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life."" Martin Freeman (the lovelorn Tim in the original BBC The Office) plays Arthur Dent who wakes up to discover massive bulldozers preparing to demolish his house to make way for a bypass. The workmen are implacable in their assertion that Arthur ought to have taken action ""at the appropriate time."" But the team is quickly superceded in importance by the arrival of massive Vogon ships preparing to demolish Earth to make way for a bypass. They are implacable in their assertion that earthlings ought to have taken action ""at the appropriate time."" Arthur discovers that his best mate Ford Prefect (Mos Def) is not an unemployed actor from Guildford but an alien from the vicinity of Betelgeuse; and that the obnoxious idiot (Sam Rockwell) who seduced the woman of his dreams Trisha McMillan (Zooey Deschanel) with the line ""Wanna see my spaceship?"" is Zaphod Beeblebrox president of the galaxy and does in fact have a spaceship. Its stolen however a super-duper prototype with an ""Improbability Drive"" that makes spatial leaps based on statistically unlikely (but poetically just) coincidences. (You could think of Dickens narratives as having unacknowledged Improbability Drives.) Arthur and Ford thumb a ride and thereby hangs--or hurtles through hyperspace--a tale. Advertisement The novels rambling plot now becomes a Holy-Grail-ish quest to find ... well best not to give away too many sight gags which are the films most reliable sources of amusement. The Vogons--bent over bloated yet desiccated almost literally the bowels of the English bureaucracy--are rubbery creatures from the Jim Henson workshop wonderful disgusting blobs. A new character Zaphods jealous rival Humma Kavula (John Malkovich) is a torso on expandable clickety tentacles the perfect visual correlative for the actors fey-squid delivery. The paddles on the Vogon planet that pop up and whack the heroes in the face when they make the mistake of having an idea are like a delirious marriage of Orwell and the Three Stooges. And those Dada-collage Improbability Drive montages The artificiality makes it clear that were watching a parody while the scale and inspiration infuse the parody with awe. The mix of the mundane and the otherworldly is sublime. But if the director music-video whiz Garth Jennings can knock you silly with a visual punch line he cant get the timing of a verbal one. He doesnt trust the long take; he chops up scenes and loses the extra awkward beat that great English comedy demands. Often the movie is frantic when it needs to be deadpan and slack when it needs some farcical urgency. Freeman is perfectly cast as Arthur with the right doughy abashment. But he stays inside himself and his scenes have no snap. I like Freeman This is not if youll pardon the expression an earth-shattering criticism. Its a quibble. But the quibbles add up. A key sequence revolving around a computer called Deep Thought--among the books most hilarious for that English overstatement/understatement thing--is simply not funny. Its programmers/high priests are young girls who dont have the necessary stammer when they pose the question on the meaning of ""Life the universe and everything."" As the computers voice the great Helen Mirren isnt too sharp either. So the comic fulcrum of the whole enterprise is a non-event. Two of the American actors work out fine. Ford Prefect really should be English but the brilliant Mos Def knows how to lighten and dry out his readings the way a smart English comic would. The radiantly pretty Zooey Deschanel plays Tricia aka Trillian with what I can only describe as a hyper-alert spaciness. Shes right on the nerd-goddess nexus Wowza. Rockwell makes a good entrance as Zaphod--a toss of the long blond hair a wink a point--but its a one-joke character. Well thats not quite true. For reasons too complicated to explain he has a second head with a more aggressive personality two jokes. But then he loses No. 2 and goes back to just the one joke now bled dry. Speaking of just one joke casting the wearily epicene Alan Rickman as the voice of the depressive robot Marvin (embodied by Warwick Davis with a huge round featureless silver head) must have seemed a slam-dunk. But that joke gets old more quickly than Rockwells. When his lines fall flat its not bad exactly--just like Marvin kind of sad. Hitchhikers is running out of fuel when Bill Nighy putters onto the screen like a modest Obi-Wan Kenobi. As Slartibartfast he designs worlds instead of knocking them down and hes the airiest Creator imaginable with eyes at once enchanted and world-weary and with that snorty little laugh (a Nighy trademark) for punctuation. Nighys rueful grace makes him--not Arthur--the ideal mascot for this movie. When he says his favorite thing is designing ""the fiddly bits"" around fjords the illogic of the universe seems blessed and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is actually transporting.

Directed by Garth Jennings from a screenplay by Douglas Adams and Karey Kirkpatrick based on the book by Adams. 103 minutes. Rated PG for thematic elements action and mild language. Several theaters. Dont panic -- not just yet anyway. ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" the long-awaited screen version of Douglas Adams cult novel of interplanetary discovery is here and while its undeniably a mess its a zippy lighthearted enjoyable ride. Purists may miss their favorite bits or raise eyebrows over the somewhat altered ending but the books goofball -- and very British -- humor survives intact. Adams who died in 2001 based the book on his own BBC radio play which in turn became a wildly popular series of novels (and along the way a television show). Before his death he wrote two drafts of a movie screenplay which was later revised by Karey Kirkpatrick (""Chicken Run""). Video/commercial director Garth Jennings signed on a quirky cast was selected and off they all went knowing that science-fiction fans were watching their every move. And will those fans be happy? Well speaking not as a rabid fan but as someone who just read the book the other day (and was pleasantly surprised by how funny it was) I thought the book and movie shared a nicely whacked-out random quality -- an episodic string of things happening some funnier than others. The movie often doesnt seem to be going anyplace in particular but the wit the visual imagination and the likability of the actors keep this often unwieldy ship afloat. Regular-guy Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman of the BBC TV series ""The Office"") wakes up one morning to find his house slated for demolition to create a freeway bypass. Turns out this doesnt matter -- the worlds about to end anyway and Arthur a puffy-faced everyman in pajamas and green terrycloth bathrobe is whisked away on an intergalactic journey guided by the electronic book ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."" He learns the importance of always having a towel; discovers the meaning of life (42); meets such creatures as Babelfish and Vogons (beware of their poetry); and finds love in a development embellished for the movie presumably on the theory that its not really a movie unless two people kiss. All this is plummily narrated by Stephen Fry interjected with animated tidbits tossed in like nuts in a salad and populated with some irresistible characters. Alan Rickmans mournful voice is a perfect match for the robot Marvin (physically portrayed by Warwick Davis) who waddles along miserably making predictions (""This will all end in tears"") and observations (""Ive been talking to the ships computer. It hates me."") Sam Rockwell in flaxen curls turns galaxy president Zaphod Beeblebrox into a combination rock star surfer dude and television evangelist. Mos Def an underrated actor (he was terrific in ""The Woodsman"") brings warmth and oddball humor to alien ""Guide"" researcher Ford Prefect -- he does a very funny fake hug -- but the movie too often seems to forget about him.A redheaded John Malkovich pops in as intergalactic missionary Humma Kavula who leads a cult awaiting the return of a large handkerchief. (Dont bother scanning the novel for this character; Adams created him for the film.) Bill Nighy charmingly exasperated plays planet construction engineer Slartibartfast. And Zooey Deschanel she of the endearingly loopy speech patterns is Arthurs love interest Trillian (formerly Tricia). Its clear watching the movie that Jennings forte is short film; his ""Hitchhikers Guide"" doesnt really hold together as one full-length movie and its sometimes so choppy you wonder what was lost during the editing process. But for all its faults the film is genuine fun. A day later Im still humming the movies theme song the title of which will resonate with Adams fans ""So Long and Thanks for All the Fish.""

"Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hitchhiker-s-guide-to-the-galaxy-the ) Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy The (United States/United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli For those who are fans of Douglas Adams Hitchhikers five-book ""trilogy"" I have two words of advice Dont Panic The 2005 film version of the book isnt nearly as bad as many Hitchhikers lovers have feared. Of course its also not as good as it could have been. For the most part this big-screen re-telling of Adams inaugural book plays it safe offers some solid performances and nice special effects and provides some chuckles along the way. ""Definitive"" this isnt. But it will do in a pinch. The fundamental problem with crafting a cinematic adaptation of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is that the book is primarily about tone. Plot and character come in a distant second. Reading the book you get a sense that Adams is talking directly to you. The chief pleasure of immersing oneself in his peculiar universe isnt to see how the story ends but to experience all of the detours along the way. For the most part such nuances get lost in the movie and the result is that while we spend some time with familiar characters in recognizable circumstances theres a hollowness to the proceedings that no amount of CGI effects and plot padding can cover up. The movie version of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy has been in the works for more than twenty years. The characters and story got their beginnings on radio. Next came the books and a BBC television series. But Adams always wanted to take this to the big screen. Through the 80s and the 90s he wrote a number of screenplay drafts. His latest which was revised and ""polished"" by Karey Kirkpatrick after his 2001 death became the basis for this production. Its unfortunate that Adams to whom the movie is dedicated didnt live long enough to see the final fruit of his labor. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy opens on Earth in England. Mild-mannered Arthur Dent (Martin Freeman) is having a bad Thursday. He awakens in the morning to discover that bulldozers have arrived to flatten his house so that an expressway bypass can be built. By lunch he has learned that his good friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) is an alien and Earth is about to be destroyed by a nasty group of creatures called the Vogons. At Fords side Arthur soon finds himself on an intergalactic odyssey in the company of the President of the Galaxy a two-headed egomaniac named Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell); Trillian (Zooey Deschanel) the last surviving Earth woman; and a depressed robot named Marvin (voice of Alan Rickman). Its hard to give away the plot of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy since its fairly minimal. The movie features a lot of running around leading up to an anticlimactic ending. If youre here looking for science fiction adventure of the formulaic kind you are attending the wrong movie. The comedic elements are uneven. Sometimes its funny; sometimes it misses the mark. At least the filmmakers try to imbue the film with as much of Adams quirky humor as possible. The excerpts from The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy which pepper the production are lifted word-for-word from the book and Stephen Frys delivery is letter-perfect. In order to pad the movie out to a reasonable length (rather than having it end after 70 minutes) a middle act has been added that was not in any of the previous incarnations. It features a meeting with a prominent galactic preacher Humma Kavula (John Malkovich) and a visit to the Vogon home world. The ending also differs from the book and theres a lightweight romantic relationship between Arthur and Trillian. All of these things originated in Adams screenplay; it isnt a case of another writer mucking around with his work posthumously. Perhaps the most significant character-based deviation from the book is the decision to develop a romance between Arthur and Trillian. In principal I think its a good idea but it isnt well handled. If the filmmakers wanted to do this why not invest a little more emotion in it? Theres a wonderful scene in which Trillian laments the possibility of having lost Arthur a if the rest of their interaction had been this good the love story might have seemed less awkward. Much as I wanted to believe in these two lost souls as having mutually found ""the one"" in outer space it never really works. The director is Garth Jennings making his feature debut after graduating from music videos. (He apparently got the job on the recommendation of Spike Jonze who was briefly attached to the film during the latter portion of its long and colorful history.) Jennings may have had some difficulty capturing the subtler nuances of Adams writing but he has no trouble underscoring the obvious social satire. There were times when this film reminded me of Brazil. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy boasts a strong ensemble of performances. Martin Freeman is the perfect choice for an ordinary unheroic Earth guy. Sam Rockwell is annoying - at times bordering on unbearable - as Zaphod but thats kind of the point. Zooey Deschanel who deserves to be better-known that she is is beguiling as Trillian. And Mos Def seems to have been born to play Ford Prefect. Voice work by Alan Rickman Stephen Fry and Helen Mirren (as Deep Thought) is superlative. And for fans of the storys earlier incarnations the original Arthur Dent Simon Jones has a cameo. Theres certainly something of Adams in this version of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy although perhaps not enough to make it an unqualified success. Maybe there was a concern that making it too offbeat would create accessibility problems for those unfamiliar with the books or the radio series. Or maybe its not inherently cinematic enough. Whatever the case although I never doubted that I was watching The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy something was missing. That something is Adams distinct voice which only speaks loudly enough to be heard on a few occasions. So dont panic but dont applaud either.

Pic remains more smile-inducing than laugh-aloud funny and has pacing and coherence problems. Thankfully strong visuals and sight gags punch up the package and high public awareness of the brand name should ensure a robust opening in Blighty. Whimsical low-tech and doggedly British in tone despite Tinseltown touches ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy"" reps the long-planned movie version of scribe Douglas Adams cult story of interstellar hitchhikers. Inheriting baggy source material talky pic remains more smile-inducing than laugh-aloud funny and has pacing and coherence problems. Thankfully strong visuals and sight gags punch up the package and high public awareness of the brand name should ensure a robust opening in Blighty and other Commonwealth countries. Stateside however pic will need to thumb a ride on upbeat word of mouth to catch on theatrically. Home format afterlife looks heavenly. Having been a radio show a 1981 TV series and several bestselling novels Adams epic is an established property with an intense following among those who appreciate its unique combo of ""Monty Python""-style silliness self-mocking satire of Brit manners and Sci-Fi for Beginners that goes whizzing off in all directions. Its core narrative is not so much a shaggy dog story as it is a litter of straggly-maned pups. Script credited to Adams who died in 2001 at age 49 and Karey Kirkpatrick (""Chicken Run"") deserves kudos for adept wrangling of the first novels fitful plot and many digressions into a semi-lucid storyline thats largely faithful to originals spirit. In contempo rural England morose hero Arthur Dent (a well-cast Martin Freeman from the original U.K. ""The Office"") is awoken one morning by bulldozers about to destroy his house for a freeway bypass. However his best friend Ford Prefect (Mos Def) reveals more shocking news First that he Prefect is actually an alien from outer space and second that Earth is about to be destroyed by the Vogons a race of repulsive bureaucratic aliens (marvelous-looking leathery puppets designed by Jim Hensons Creature Shop) who are making way for a hyperspace bypass. Prefects real job is as a researcher for the universal bestseller ""The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy."" This is a sort of souped-up Tablet computer/encyclopedia whose entries and stories are unspooled as stylized 2-D animations throughout with clipped accompanying voiceover by Brit thesp Stephen Fry. Using the Guide and a special hitchhikers ring Prefect and Dent stow away aboard a Vogon ship seconds before Earth goes kerblooey. They then escape Vogon torture-by-poetry by hitching another ride on the Heart of Gold a passing space vessel manned by Prefects cousin the galaxys smarmy but charming two-headed three-armed president Zaphod Beeblebrox (Sam Rockwell). Also aboard the Heart of Gold are Earth girl Trillian aka Tricia MacMillan (Zooey Deschanel) whom Dent had once fallen in love with at a London party just before Beeblebrox whisked her off; and Marvin the Paranoid Android (diminutive Warwick Davis in robot suit voice by Alan Rickman) a lugubrious mechanical passive-aggressive whose morose line in self-pity reaps some of pics biggest laughs. With the characters thus established the crew goes off adventuring in a rather messy mass of subplots. Some of these will make better sense to fans familiar with the original material such as the Guides crucial skit about a supercomputer (voiced by Helen Mirren). However fans may not be so pleased with a love-triangle subplot -- between Beeblebrox Trillian and Dent -- thats been invented for the movie. This was presumably designed to make the nerdy male-skewed original more appealing to distaff auds. When Trillian is eventually captured by the Vogons who wrongly believe shes kidnapped Beeblebrox Dent leads a rescue mission that succeeds because he understands the fine British art of ""queuing"" aka getting in line. Seg in which Dent amp; Co. must fill out a Vogon form in triplicate and return repeatedly to the hatch of a bored female Vogon pen-pusher to secure a repeal of Trillians death sentence encapsulates pics offbeat Brit humor at its best. Here the universe is imagined as a kind of vast equivalent of Blighty -- or rather the country as it thought of itself in the late 70s-early 80s. Though the place is riddled by bureaucracy inefficiency and a service culture that doesnt quite work politeness is still maintained even by a voicemail message that informs the caller ""Your death may be monitored for training purposes."" However in pics midsection the pace becomes somewhat sluggish due to an overload of asides from the Guide -- pure Adams material that will please fans but which sounds less funny onscreen than on the printed page. In an effort to up the laugh count first-time feature helmer Garth Jennings inserts some cute slapstick biz. Surfaces of sets and costumes are so intricately tricked out that they almost distract from comprehension of whats going on as in a cameo appearance by a digitally-enhanced John Malkovich as a half-man half-mechanical preacher alien (another of the scripts inventions). Nor does it help that some of the cast particularly Def and Deschanel as Prefect and Trillian look lost in space without direction and phone in underwhelming perfs. Still Rockwells manic gurning as Beeblebrox and the smattering of veteran Brit thesps in minor roles (particularly Bill Nighy as a planet designer specializing in fjords) makes up for some of the shortfall. Decision to go more for lower-budget special effects favoring puppets and plasticine instead of CGI pays dividends adding a nostalgic old-school feel that harks back to the original on-the-cheap TV series as well as to vintage ""Dr. Who."" Relatively small amount of CGI is used with precision -- to create Beeblebroxs second head or vast thoughtfully designed sets.
