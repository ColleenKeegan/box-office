Brooks sitcom roots are all too readily apparent in ""As Good as It Gets"" a sporadically funny romantic comedy with all the dramatic plausibility and tonal consistency of a TV variety show. James L. Brooks sitcom roots are all too readily apparent in ""As Good as It Gets"" a sporadically funny romantic comedy with all the dramatic plausibility and tonal consistency of a TV variety show. The filmmakers ability to deliver crowd-pleasing entertainment remains intact as the outrageous one-liners of Jack Nicholsons hopelessly misanthropic anti-p.c. leading character snap one to attention and the various narrative zigzags will keep viewers on their toes. But this arch film changes mood and apparent intention virtually every other minute creating a messy and finally off-putting ambiance that makes the three main characters and their problems become tiresome well before the far-too-long postponed denouement. Pics blatantly accessible humorous and emotional elements should land this in the commercial winners circle although reported 75 million-plus budget puts recoupment a good way off. At its best as in ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Broadcast News"" Brooks work manages to deftly blend comedy and sentiment to create a credible impression of heightened reality. Here the familiar components are present but are thrown together in a such a haphazard ill-considered manner that any hope of dramatic coherence and complete characterizations is entirely undercut. At the same time the director fully indulges a previously fitful tendency toward overstatement and exaggeration just as he has acquired an acute case of the cutes. Brooks policy this time out seems to have been when in doubt cut away to the performing dog. Despite a jumble of uncertain coverage and unseemly editing opening scenes contain considerable promise. In an obviously comic context middle-aged New York City curmudgeon Melvin Udall (Nicholson) defines himself as the neighbor from hell by tossing a little dog down the apartment buildings garbage chute (the pooch unfortunately survives to figure prominently in the action from then on) and by gleefully assailing both Fidos gay owner Simon (Greg Kinnear) and the latters black friend Frank (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in terms that would endear him to the KKK. Melvins sarcastic vitriol is so fearlessly extreme as to be outrageously funny at first exposure. But his obsessive-compulsive personality has by this point in his life become encrusted and moldy; he lives his entire life alone in his apartment where he is busy finishing his 62nd book; he seemingly has no friends or family; and he emerges from his shell just once a day to eat at the same restaurant to which the germophobe brings his own plastic utensils and where he is tended to and barely tolerated by his favorite waitress Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt). Although a pretty good sport about everything Carol has her own problems the most serious -- and cliched -- of which is her asthmatic son Spencer. Typical of the films uncertain approach to mixing comedy and pathos is the disastrous end of a date in which Carols attempt at a little lovemaking with a young suitor is fatally interrupted by the sickly Spencer. From the beginning it is clear that the story has only one potential trajectory that of the gradual humanization of Melvin. Unfortunately the road to this end is considerably bumpier longer and more contrived than anticipated. The door to his self-awakening is opened by of all things Simons dog for which Melvin is obliged to care after the young painter is hospitalized after a brutal mugging. To Melvins astonishment he actually comes to love the mutt which seemingly opens something in this Scrooges heart to the point where he starts arranging for some unsolicited first-class medical care for Carols son. Ninety minutes in pic takes a half-hour physical detour when Melvin is shanghaied into driving Simon and Carol down to Baltimore. The hotel stop involved provides a setting for some intimacy that may never have materialized otherwise capped by Melvins earthshaking confession to Carol that ""You made me want to be a better man."" For his part Simon who has been impoverished by the medical expenses of his recuperation also makes an emotional breakthrough on the trip. But despite the strides made by all three characters toward a semblance of self-realization that was nowhere in sight at the outset the ways they are achieved often seem forced and unconvincing. Some of this has to do with the abruptness and arbitrariness with which things happen in this lurching picture which never finds a smooth road to travel. But much of it is also a result of the wildly varying tone in which attempts at genuine human moments and credible emotion can be negated in an instant by cheap comic effects and overt pandering to the audience. Representing the pictures virtues and flaws in a nutshell is Nicholsons performance which is wonderfully enjoyable when Melvin remains an irascible s.o.b. but becomes unfathomable in its would-be tender moments. The characters background and what made him the way he is remains resolutely unexplored and the actor increasingly resorts to shuffling and mugging to paste over the cracks in motivation. Hunts Carol is a more rounded and comprehensible creation but the character isnt all that interesting and the notes Hunt hits while true never seem particularly surprising or unusual. Kinnear is decent as the superficially successful but insecure artist while some of the performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. in his first role since winning an Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire"" must have been left on the cutting room floor since he pops up only sporadically as a rather blustery plot facilitator. John Baileys lensing has a nice pastel quality that agreeably reflects the pics modest physical dimensions. But Richard Marks editing strains against all but impossible odds to smooth over the materials scattershot moods and impressions.

Starring Jack Nicholson Helen Hunt Greg Kinnear Cuba Gooding Jr. Skeet Ulrich and Shirley Knight. Directed by James L. Brooks. (Rated PG-13. 138 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jack Nicholson takes up a lot of space on the screen. And when he gets a big showy role such as Melvin a hateful recluse in ""As Good as It Gets"" theres no containing him. Helen Hunt gets high marks for holding her own against so much star power. As Carol -- a down-on- her-luck waitress whose bad luck extends to the sour Melvins insisting on eating at her station every day -- Hunt matches Nicholson growl for growl and arched eyebrow for arched eyebrow. She gives a tough touching performance that should erase any doubt that she has what it takes for the big screen. After a rocky first half-hour dur ing which director James. L Brooks (""Terms of Endearment"" ""Broadcast News"") strains too hard for laughs the movie finds its tempo. It becomes as good as its two leads which is almost as good as it gets. Carol is a single mother with an asthmatic son who she thinks requires her constant attention. On the rare occasion when she brings a man home her son calls to her while theyre making love on the sofa. Returning from ministering first aid Carol attempts to rearouse her date -- but the vomit on her dress isnt exactly an aphrodisiac. ""This is just a little too much reality for a Friday night"" he complains making a beeline for the door. For a while the reality in ""As Good as It Gets"" also is off-putting. Melvin is introduced throwing a neighbors dog down the garbage chute. He mocks and humiliates this neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear in another of this films winning performances) for being gay. Melvin also rails against blacks and Jews using words that make you cringe as well as wonder how he could get away with it in New York of all places where somebody surely would flatten him. Its hard to know whats eating him. Hes a neurotic wreck. His shrink says hes an obsessive compulsive and Melvin is shown avoiding cracks on the sidewalk and throwing away bars of soap after one use. But compulsives arent inherently mean-spirited. The films sourness turns sweet when it becomes clear where Brooks (who wrote the script with Mark Andrus) is heading. ""As Good as It Gets"" turns out to be about love and its ability to redeem the seemingly irredeemable. Melvin is a successful romance novelist who cant let himself experience the feelings he writes about. Carol and Simon become friends and gang up on Melvin -- the people who can feel versus someone whos incapable of it. When Carol quits her job to supervise her sons medical care Melvin becomes distraught. He thinks its only because his ritual is upset if shes not there to wait on him but clearly theres more to it. To get her back he arranges for a top specialist to treat the boy. Suspecting an ulterior motive Carol rushes over to Melvins apartment in a rainstorm to tell him she will never have sex with him. Hunt is beguiling in this scene giving Carol the right mix of embarrassment and horror when she realizes the rain has soaked her blouse and Melvin can see through it. Brooks strikes a chord when he has Carol use four-letter words to describe the HMO that has mangled her sons case. The audience hoots and claps its approval. ""As Good as It Gets"" may be the first movie to take on HMOs but it isnt the first to take a position on love. It just does it more convincingly than most. Nicholson has two great moments when he tries to pay Carol a compliment. The first time Melvins not yet ready to let his feelings show and he has to take it back. When he finally brings himself to let the compliment stand the words he finds are ones any woman would adore hearing. Part of the appeal of this comedy is that Melvins transformation never gets sappy. When hes still in his W.C. Fields mode Nicholson does something Fields would never have allowed He appears with a scene-stealing dog. But this pooch also stops short of being sappy. The movie often verges on being too much; Brooks supreme balancing act is to keep it all under control.

"As Good as It Gets | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; as-good-as-it-gets ) As Good as It Gets (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli As Good as It Gets is a perfect Christmas release not because the story takes place during the Yule season but because many of the plot elements are straight out of Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol. Theres more than just a little Scrooge in Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) the most unpleasant man in Manhattan. And like Scrooge the unwilling sinner is on the road to redemption. Instead of four ghosts we have four living breathing entities (one woman two men and a dog) but the result is the same. By the time we leave the theater the warmth of love has melted the coldest heart on Earth. Thats the reason this is called a ""feel good"" movie. As Good as It Gets is really two related movies in one which explains the surprisingly long running time. While 138 minutes is fine for an epic adventure or a weighty drama it makes a lightweight effort like this seem a little bloated. The film is ambitious it tries to wed the modern-day non-supernatural A Christmas Carol with a traditional romantic comedy. Director James L. Brooks who does these kinds of movies as well as anyone in Hollywood has moderate success. As Good as It Gets is not a positive triumph but it does bring a smile to the face and perhaps in some cases a tear to the eye. Jack Nicholson plays Melvin a successful author who lives the life of a recluse. When the movie opens hes depicted as so thoroughly rotten that it actually becomes difficult to root for him even once he begins to mend his ways. Hes a homophobic anti-Semitic racist with an intense dislike of dogs (he throws one down a garbage chute) and people. Every time he opens his mouth something vicious comes out. The neighbors in his Greenwich Village apartment building all avoid him and the waitress at his favorite restaurant barely tolerates his presence. To make matters worse Melvin is afflicted with an obsessive/compulsive disorder that makes his behavior seem even more strange. He brings his own utensils when he goes out to dinner he refuses to step on sidewalk cracks and he wears gloves all the time. Then something happens to change Melvins life. One of his neighbors a gay artist named Simon (Greg Kinnear) is beaten up by a group of robbers. Simons dealer Frank (Cuba Gooding Jr.) forces Melvin to care for Simons dog. Gradually Melvin comes to love the little animal and after discovering a previously-unsuspected wellspring of humanity deep within himself he begins exercising it in other ways paying a doctor to care for the sick son of his regular waitress Carol (Helen Hunt) and offering Simon support when he comes home from the hospital. Of course no one can change overnight and there are times when the old Melvin rears his ugly head leading to plot complications. Nicholson is wonderful as Melvin the jerk. He delivers the acid one-liners with real venom has perfected the irritating mannerisms of an obsessive/compulsive individual and generally makes it easy to accept the character as the last person youd want to spend any time with. As the kinder gentler Melvin however hes not quiet as successful. Vulnerability doesnt come easy to Nicholson and the prickly side of his personality interferes with our acceptance of Melvin as a new man. We get the feeling that as soon as the end credits roll hes going to fall back into his old habits rather quickly. He does have some great lines though. (For example when explaining how he writes women so well in his books Melvin comments ""I think of a man then I take away reason and accountability."") Helen Hunt last seen on the big screen in Twister but best known for her role in TVs ""Mad About You"" gives real breadth and depth to Carol a woman who lives to serve her son and who doesnt know how to cope with Melvins attention. Like Melvin the events in As Good as It Gets transform Carol but her gentler gradual personality shift is more believable. Hunt does a good job portraying Carols weariness early in the film followed by an almost-childlike joy as she rediscovers herself. Alas she and Nicholson never really click which puts something of a damper on the romantic storyline. The real surprise is Greg Kinnear who turns in a more solidly dramatic performance than we had a right to suspect based on his past record. In Sabrina Kinnear displayed a feckless charm but here hes required to dig deeper. Simon an already-emotionally-wounded individual has suffered a massive betrayal that has robbed him of the will to live and Kinnear manages to capture the essence of this individual and bring it to life on screen. The supporting cast includes veteran actress Shirley Knight as Carols mother Skeet Ulrich as one of Simons models and a scene-stealing dog. Ultimately its the quirks and details of As Good as It Gets script (by Brooks and co-writer Mark Andrus) rather than the broad strokes which make the film enjoyable. Essentially this is a formulaic connect-the-dots tale which offers few if any surprises. Fifteen minutes into the movie youll be able to guess exactly how it will all work out. As a result the chief pleasure for the next two hours is watching the characters grow and interact as they traverse the familiar path. As Good as It Gets may not quite live up to its title but it doesnt fall unacceptably short of the mark. As Good as It Gets (United States 1997) Director James L.
