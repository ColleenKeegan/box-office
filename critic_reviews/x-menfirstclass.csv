Scott Fitzgerald. ""Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in actual destitution or physical suffering - this is an all-weather beatitude for gloom in general and fairly salutary day-time advice for everyone. But at three-o-clock in the morning a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence and the cure doesnt always work..."" Given that tidbit of wisdom Id say three-o-clock in the morning is the perfect time to see X-Men First Class. Because otherwise youre liable to notice a certain difference in the ""tragic importance"" of the films two main storylines. One is the story of a bunch of mutant teenagers struggling with the fact that they dont fit in with ""normal"" people. Their ""gifts"" set them apart in painful even crippling ways and no one can say that their suffering isnt real. The trouble is the other story concerns Erik Lehnsherr (played with moving handsome earnestness by Michael Fassbender) the mutant who will become the villain Magneto. Erik is a young Jewish mutant in Nazi Germany who sees his mother gunned down because he cant make his power over magnetism work on command. Who is then taken in hand by his mothers murderer and subjected to horrific experimentation in a concentration camp. Whose whole life thereafter is consumed by the desire for revenge. A movie gives you a world and asks you to enter in and its a fair request. Theres no point is dismissing the drama of The Breakfast Club simply because American high school kids dont suffer the way the Jews suffered in Schindlers List. But if one movie tries to serve up both worlds side by side then it makes it a little bit harder to care about Molly Ringwalds rich-girl insecurities. X-Men First Class seems to understand this at some level and tries to compensate by having our teenage mutants watch one of their own get taken out by the baddies. But the whole thing is rushed slapdash - weve just met the fellow and so have they. Hes here and then hes gone. Its rough but its not ""Mom is dead because you couldnt move the coin."" Likewise during the big final battle its hard to get too worked up over a couple of low-grade mutants chasing each other through the air when as Erik puts it ""Frankenstein is meeting his creator."" Actually ""rushed"" and ""slapdash"" were never far from my thoughts while watching X-Men First Class. Story ""Hey its Oliver Platt working as the crucial sympathetic link between the U.S. Government and the mutants. Hm hes having to wrestle with the fact that while he has the authority the mutants have the power. Trouble brewing? No wait hes dead. Along with a whole bunch of other totally anonymous government agents. Guess he didnt matter after all."" Character ""Wow young Charles Xavier sure is meant to seem wise and erudite - citing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in an effort to get young Hank McCoy to accept his beastly characteristics (urgh) telling Erik that true power comes from finding the point between rage and serenity (huh?). But how come hes such a completely lunkheaded jerk when dealing with Mystique a girl desperate to be thought of as beautiful despite her bumpy blue skin? Oh right - because Mystique eventually sides with the evil mutants and we need to find a way to get her from point A (Xavier) to point B (Magneto). I guess thats what comes of making a prequel. Youre kind of constrained by what must come later."" Effects ""Okay I get that signaling telepathic communication by making the voice in your head kind of loud and tinny is a nod to the time period in which the film is set. Special effects in the 60s were kind of cheesy werent they? That explains the ridiculous-looking doomsday montage that Xavier picks up telepathically from the lady in the white catsuit. But damn - when that sub is crashing through those palms the trees look straight out of World of Warcraft. And I dont even play World of Warcraft."" Central Message ""It doesnt help a movie when the villain is right. Magneto keeps saying that mutants are an evolutionary advance and that even Xavier knows how evolutionary advances result in the extinction of the species thats been left behind. And he keeps predicting that because of this humanity will hate the mutants and try to kill them. And hes right every time. Xavier keeps yammering about how we can be the better men but he doesnt seem to know what that means. When Erik/Magneto responds We are the better men the obvious answer is that better is determined not by what you can do but by what kind of man you are. Xavier just keeps silent."" Why be so harsh and long-winded about a superhero movie? Because its an ambitious superhero movie. At one point Xavier pleads with Erik to show mercy saying that most of the enemy force is made up of good men who are just following orders. Erik responds that hes suffered enough at the hands of men who are just following orders and that he will never forget. Thats right he drops two of the phrases most commonly associated with the Holocaust in a movie about the plight of a mutant minority. If youre going to go for that kind of resonance and have it come off as anything other than cheap youve got to nail the execution.

In the first part the superhero attains his or her power; in the second he or she weighs the demands of life and human relationships against the responsibility of superheroism (and its attendant fame); and in the third there are different villains and more occasions for hand-wringing and the stars fee has become so huge that the studio just wants to wipe the slate clean and go back to the beginning  which is narratively speaking the easy part of the whole arc. (Plus the fanboys have closer emotional ties to their heroes in the earlier nerdier stages.) In the case of the X-Men saga which plunged to earth in part three under the hacktacular Brett Ratner after Bryan Singer had found his wings in X2 the decision to start over must have been particularly easy. The old principals are old principals while Hugh Jackman as Wolverine now has his own Origins plotline. And there really is an earlier story to tell a good one about the youngish Professor Charles Xaviers decision way back in 1962 to identify shelter and educate the planets population of mutants and his fundamental rift with the separatist mutant known as Magneto. X-Men First Class is thoroughly second-rate but its pleasant enough. Where Singer often let his It Gets Betterstyle gay-rights subtext smother the sheer pop exhilaration of the material the new director Matthew Vaughn allows nothing to bog him down. The even-less-talented acolyte of Guy Ritchie Vaughn developed his self-consciously hip ironic style at the feet of his petit-maestro and wouldnt know how to put real emotions onscreen if he even had any. Nazis round up Jews for concentration camps characters whom we care about are brutally murdered theres an imminent nuclear holocaust  and it all just flies by. Vaughn does linger on his female characters miniskirts though. He has priorities. Hes lucky he also has two first-rate actors in the lead blue-eyed Scots cutie James McAvoy as Xavier and German-Irish chameleon Michael Fassbender as Erik soon to be the human magnet dubbed Magneto. McAvoy doesnt have Patrick Stewarts stentorian chops but hes able to drop his natural jauntiness on cue and rise to several momentous occasions and Fassbender turns the chip on Eriks shoulder into a magnetic force all its own. They team up to join forces with the CIA (represented by Oliver Platt) to battle a Dr. Mengelelike supervillain called Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) but Erik is only onboard because Shaw exterminated his mom. Unlike the staunchly accommodationist Xavier the future Magneto shares Shaws militant anti-humanism. He has witnessed the way governments round up the undesirables. Part of the fun in prequels like X-Men First Class is seeing how characters youve never met evolve into characters youve known for years. In this case the pivotal figure is Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) the blue-skinned shape-shifter who becomes Xaviers surrogate sister  but is destined to grow into Magnetos most formidable ally Mystique. Lawrence is a likable presence (she still has her delectable baby fat) and makes her mutant radicalization convincing  but not her defection from the side of her beloved Xavier. The movie has a lot of balls in the air and Vaughn doesnt focus on any one too long. He has an easier time with split-screen training montages than you know feelings. As an American secret agent Rose Byrne has a promising first scene in which she impulsively strips down to her lingerie to follow the guy who played Aaron in 24 into a swank nightclub but she fades into the background once McAvoy and Fassbender do their male-bonding thing. January Jones as an icy telepath strides around in a white miniskirt and pillbox hat and affects a state of exquisite boredom and superiority  cleverly making her ineptitude as an actress look like a creative choice. By far the most passionate performance comes from Bacon who has evidently decided that if youre going to play a villain who exults in his villainy you dont half-exult You throw back your head and throw up your arms and groooooove on your evil. Its too bad that for reasons I cant spell out what should be his mightiest moment  his last in the picture  is his most inert. The climax is the biggest letdown a giant hash of crosscutting and unremarkable (in an era in which weve seen everything) CGI but it does throw a whole new light on the Cuban Missile Crisis. The fact is its a lot less disturbing to believe that the U.S. and Soviet Union came this close to nuking each other out of existence because of unseen psychotic mutants than by humans whom Christopher Hitchens has rightly called high-risk narcissists."" -- David Edelstein Related Stories Featured In James McAvoy on Prebooting Professor X in X-Men First Class (6/6/11) Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick 6 Things We Learned About HBOas New Series Insecure Teen Wolfs Tyler Posey Apologizes For His Fake Coming Out HBOas Divorce Is Actually a Wish Fulfillment Comedy TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

First Look X-Men First Class (Trailer) Review There may be strength in numbers but thats not necessarily true when it comes to superheroes There may be strength in numbers but thats not necessarily true when it comes to superheroes. The X-Men films have always felt crowded. The latest reboot ""X-Men First Class"" is a solid summer popcorn offering -- but again sometimes it is overwhelmed by a surfeit of superheroes. When Superman Batman Spider-Man or Iron Man -- the star performers of the last three decades worth of comic-book movies -- are on the job theres never any doubt about who does the actual heavy lifting in vanquishing the bad guys. If theres a problem these spandexed pros get to work and fix it themselves. They never outsource or delegate. In contrast each X-Man (and X-Woman) thanks to being genetic mutants has a single superpower. To beat back evil they collaborate and cooperate each contributing where and how they can. You can read minds? OK you tell us what the bad guys are thinking. Youre the one who can bend metal? Please break through their fortifications. And you youre the one who throws fire bolts? Okay go ahead and blow em up now. Arguably ""X-Men"" is the most politically complex and radical of the popular comic franchises. Its mutant hero Professor X believes that mutants and humans can get along -- a position that is a symbolic stand-in for favoring racial and now sexual equality and harmony. Moreover whereas Superman Batman and the others of their ilk are all rugged individualists the X-Men adhere to collective responsibility and action. (Surely theres a doctoral thesis in there somewhere. Just thank me in the acknowledgements.) The downside to the X-Men ethos? The more X-Men there are in a movie the more confused and diffuse the storytelling becomes. This was particularly true in 2006s third in the series ""Last Stand"" directed by Brett Ratner. The film introduced a slew of new teenage mutants each eager to show off their particular talent causing the film to devolve into a superhero version of the crowded audition episodes of ""American Idol."" (Quick X-Men refresher course The first film ""X-Men"" came out in 2000 followed by ""X2 X-Men United"" in 2003 both directed by Bryan Singer. The fourth film 2009s ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" ditched the multitude of mutants to concentrate on the early days of the series most charismatic character Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman.) ""X-Men First Class"" is a reboot of sorts. This one wisely concentrates -- and is at its best when it does so -- on the growing friendship between Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). As every fan knows these two young men both mutants will eventually grow into fierce rivals after an ideological split. Xavier who believes that mutants and humans can get along will become the wise wheelchair-riding hero Professor X while Lehnsherr will turn into helmet-wearing baddie Magneto who argues in favor of mutant superiority and separatism. In the early 60s the two young mutants join forces to battle Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) a megalomaniacal mutant who is plotting to start a war of mutual destruction between the U.S. and the arch-enemy Russia -- that would be the Cuban Missile Crisis -- so that he himself can rule the world. (Lehnsherr and Shaw have a back history Lehnsherr who is Jewish was imprisoned as a boy in a concentration camp where Shaw a Nazi scientist tortured him.) In preparing to battle Shaw Xavier and Lehnsherr assemble their own mod squad of young mutants each with a distinctive power (sprouting wings and flying emitting supersonic screams possessing monkey feet etc.). But even as the Xavier and Lehnsherr train these recruits the mens philosophies on the proper role for mutants in society begin to differ. The fun here -- besides a nifty cameo with Jackman -- is watching the pieces of the X-Men mythology click into place. We learn how blue-hued Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) came to embrace proudly her mutant self how Xavier became a paraplegic how Magneto acquired his protective helmet and the like. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake"" ""Kick-Ass"") shows a felicitous knack for concentrating on character -- at least as far as Xavier and Lehnsherr are concerned -- and punching up humor in scenes whenever possible. It helps that McAvoy and Fassbender are both talented actors who seem fully committed to their roles. As ""X-Men"" films go this one gets the job done and is certainly better than ""Last Stand"" or ""Wolverine."" But there are still just too darn many X-Men and -- other than Xavier Lehnsherr and Mystique -- too few of them are interesting enough to hold our attention. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Unlike Batman Begins though X-Men First Class doesnt start from scratch. Instead it uses the themes of the previous movies to build an intelligent fast-paced and highly entertaining prequel. It also re-raises the bar for superhero flicks in general which have gotten complacent lately. Like most stories this one starts with the Nazis. In 1944 young Erik Lehnsherr (Bill Milner) displays telekinetic powers when hes separated from his mother in a concentration camp thus drawing the attention of a nasty doctor (Kevin Bacon speaking German and everything) who wants to study harness and replicate Eriks abilities. At the same time in New York state a wealthy British boy named Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher) who can read minds meets a girl named Raven (Morgan Lily) who can shapeshift but whose natural state is blue and scaly. In 1962 Charles has grown up to be a brilliant and compassionate scientist (now played by James McAvoy) seeking to understand genetic abnormalities while Erik has grown up to be an angry vengeful man (now played by Michael Fassbender) whos obsessed with tracking down the doctor who tortured him. Raven (now Jennifer Lawrence) isnt angry but she is frustrated at being saddled with a mutation that unlike Charles is physically obvious. These three are not the only mutants in the world mind you. That Nazi doctor now going by the name Sebastian Shaw is traveling with a few sinister ones -- a telepath (January Jones) made out of diamonds (or something?) a dude who can blow windstorms (Alex Gonzalez) and a teleporter (Jason Flemyng) -- in his quest to do secret dastardly things. The CIA gets involved when agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) stumbles upon the existence of mutant powers and figures America better get on board with this what with it being the Cold War and all. We know that Charles and Erik are destined to become Professor X and Magneto one leading the peaceful band of crime-fighting mutants the other at the head of the militant faction that views non-mutants as enemies. When they first meet Charles and Erik have the same goal -- to thwart Sebastian Shaw -- but different motives for it. This gets to the heart of what all the X-Men films have been about being ""different"" in a society that sometimes rewards differentness and sometimes vilifies it. Are these powers a blessing or a curse? Do they make you better or do they make you defective? Raven finds comfort in befriending Hank (Nicholas Hoult) a scientist with mutant powers almost as readily apparent as hers whos formulating a serum to change that. He and Raven dont want to get rid of their abilities altogether; they just dont want them to be obvious when they go out in public. Other young mutants like the fire-blasting Alex Summers (Lucas Till) the glass-shattering Sean Cassidy (Caleb Landry Jones) and the fairy-winged Angel Salvadore (Zoe Kravitz) have varying feelings about their abilities ranging from defensive to self-conscious meek to defiant. Not all of these characters are fully developed -- even a movie with a 132-minute running time has its limitations apparently -- but they add flavor. The movie manages to make each mutants power crucial at some point without getting too contrived (although Im not exactly clear on how Sean aka Banshee is able to fly). X-Men First Class was directed by Matthew Vaughn whose previous features gave him practice with the elements vital to this ones success. Layer Cake was a twisty stylish crime caper set in something like the real world; Stardust was pure fairy-tale fantasy; and Kick-Ass was about an amateur superhero. All three were energetic and confident as is the new film which dashes assuredly from one rousing sequence to the next yet never feels like its employing action just for actions sake. With a screenplay credited to Vaughn regular collaborator Jane Goldman and the Thor duo of Ashley Edward Miller and Jack Stentz the film strives to put the mutants powers in a real-world context with real-world repercussions. It uses actual events like the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Nazis experiments with genetics as the backdrop. Few things are clear-cut; the line between hero and villain is sometimes hard to see. Erik and Charles though they disagree on tactics are not enemies and both mens points of view are understandable. The issues they face are too complex to be boiled down to a simple ""right"" and ""wrong"" way to proceed. Meanwhile the truly evil Sebastian Shaw is a reflection of each mans worst potential Like Charles he started out being interested in the science behind mutation; like Erik he came to believe mutants were inherently superior to regular mortals. Either man could go down the wrong path and end up like Shaw. I come to this movie with no investment in its characters or their origins. I have no idea how much of whats established here violates comic book canon and I dont remember the previous movies well enough to say whether this one negates what happens in them. (Does Charles Xavier doing such-and-such in First Class mean he couldnt have done some other thing that we saw him do in X2 X-Men United??? Dunno) What I do know is that the movie feels smarter and more ambitious than many of its brethren not to mention more thrilling and flat-out fun. The central performances by Michael Fassbender and James McAvoy are unusually nuanced for a superhero flick somehow vulnerable and badass at the same time.

Personally I dont really think we could have gotten a better film well not dramatically better anyway. For me I felt like the shaky cam was a way to try carry the first person style over to the film well I hope anyway. Well youll probably enjoy Catching Fire more? no shaky cam and theyre changing the writers up a bit. Georgesaid on Tuesday July 17 2012 33603 PMOne important thing I lvoe Matthew Vaighn especially kick-Ass I think the acting is exceptional (especially among the two leads and Jennifer Lawrence) while the characters are engaging and the script sharp and occasionally witty-but for a film that clocks in at over 2 hours it all feels a bit rushed at times. It feels like we could not ahve a direct sequel to this and go straight to the original X-Men and leave very little unanswered because by the time it ends its all wrapped up-an unusual complaint that it leaves very little hanging to be explored later. A related complaint regarding how some of the mutants can get lost in the shuffle is that I was actually starting to like the character of Darwin so his sudden death whilst by no means unaffecting was too quick and felt somewhat cruel to the audience-one of the most interesting mutant characters (and powers and a doorway to exploration of the civil rights turbulence of the time) is taken away far too soon.

What if Mengele-style Nazi human experimentation was actually like part of a world-domination plan perpetrated by a mutant (Kevin Bacon)? What if the Cuban Missile Crisis was actually like part of a world-domination plan perpetrated by that same mutant? This fifth installment in the X-Men series is also the origin story of how Professor X (a puffy James McAvoy in the role previously played by Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender whose steely studliness doesnt exactly suggest a younger Ian McKellen) transformed from intensely bromantic collaborators into mortal enemies. Most of Vaughns choices are inspired by the early-60s setting which offers ample excuse to tart up the actresses (including January Jones as evil telepath Emma Frost Jennifer Lawrence as a barely le-gal version of the naked blue shapeshifter Mystique and Rose Byrne as a mutant-friendly CIA agent) in go-go boots and miniskirts; allows for the appropriation of actual Bay of Pigs-related archival footage; and facilitates incredibly facile nods to the civil rights movement (when somebody says the word ""enslaved"" Vaughn cuts to a black guy for reaction). A cameo from an old-school X-Man only serves to remind how stylish and witty the first installment was a decade ago. Lacking a single memorable joke or striking image First Class is as perfunc-tory and passionless as would-be franchise resurrections get.

"X-Men First Class | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x-men-first-class ) X-Men First Class (United States 2011) June 03 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The easiest way to summarize my reaction to X-Men First Class is with a shrug. The movie is competently made (and not in 3-D thankfully) has some nice action sequences tells its story with workmanlike efficiency and will probably please fans of the comic books. None of these things however could chase away the feeling of indifference that settled over me as I watched the movie unfold. X-Men First Class is not only a prequel to the popular cinematic series about Charles Xavier and his merry band of mutants but its an ""origin story."" And therein lies the problem. Origin stories by their nature are less about telling compelling tales than assembling all the pieces. In road trips the journey matters more than the destination. In origin stories the journey is irrelevant as long as when it comes time for the end credits everyone is where we expect them to be Kirk in the captains chair with Spock and McCoy by his side Spider-Man swinging from New York Citys skyscrapers Superman soaring high over his adopted world Batman giving the Bat Signal to Commissioner Gordon. When Bryan Singer made X-Men in 2000 he wisely dispensed with an origin story deeming it to be unnecessary and constraining. He got right into the meat of the action. Now some 11 years later (with Singer back on the team this time functioning as a producer) were paying for that decision. After a brief opening in a Nazi concentration camp in Poland during World War II the movie fast-forwards to 1962 which some have called the last year of American innocence. Sure the Bay of Pigs was behind us but JFKs assassination Vietnam and Watergate were still to come. X-Men First Class interweaves established textbook history with comic book mythology providing a new spin on events. Although not as radical as what Quentin Tarantino did in Inglourious Basterds its still intriguing. The bulk of the movie concerns the efforts of newly-minted professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) in his capacity as a CIA advisor working with agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) to assemble a collection of mutants capable of opposing ex-Nazi megalomaniac Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Xaviers most powerful ally is Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) whose magnetic control over metal needs some refining. Erik has a strong personal motivation for bringing down Shaw who killed his mother. Erik doesnt much care whether his dish of revenge is served cold or hot as long as its served. And thats where he and the mild peace-loving Xavier part ways in their personal philosophies. Xavier believes that once Shaw is out of the way humankind and mutantkind will be able to live in peace. Erik on the other hand embraces the necessity of violence and believes that a global war is inevitable. Between special-effects heavy fight scenes (some of which echo some of the most outrageous action from the 60s James Bond movies) X-Men First Class is laden with exposition much of which will be of limited interest to the X-Men novitiate. Its a strangely talky motion picture that tries to advance several philosophical themes; these would have been more interesting if we werent already aware of how they will play out in the ""future"" X-Men trilogy. Theres the prequel/origin story curse again we know whats going to happen so its difficult to surprise. Its tough to become immersed in a narrative when theres a checklist in the back of the mind of things that have to happen. Xavier losing the use of his legs... Check. Erik and Xavier going their separate ways... Check. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) aligning with Erik... Check. Erik donning Shaws fetching helmet... Check. And so on... This impediment is not unique to X-Men First Class. Its a universal prequel problem and one of the reasons why superior prequels are hard to find. With one notable exception the characters are either boring or woefully underdeveloped. Its hard to assign blame to the miscast James McAvoy who is a good actor but his Xavier is uninteresting and will have viewers yearning for Patrick Stewart. Its difficult to develop a rooting interest in someone this dull. None of Xaviers students merit much interest in large part because of the limitations of the already hefty (130 minutes) running time. Attempts are made at character building for Mystique but theyre perfunctory and not entirely successful. Everyone else such as Havoc Beast Emma Frost Darwin Angel is defined by their abilities rather than their personalities. The exception is Erik/Magneto whose presence is so forceful that he reduces Xavier to an afterthought. Michael Fassbender is magnetic; he captivates much as he did in Fish Tank and Jane Eyre but with more force due to the epic scope. The underdeveloped father/son mentor/pupil creator/monster relationship between Erik and Kevin Bacons Shaw represents the movies most compelling dynamic; sadly much of this is left unexplored as the movie stumbles around advancing Xaviers unremarkable backstory. Originally this was planned to be Magnetos origin movie (along the lines of Wolverine). In retrospect that might have been a better way to go. Fassbenders Erik could easily dominate a two-hour movie. When the dust settles on 2011s crop of superhero movies it seems likely that X-Men First Class will end up somewhere in the middle floating in a moat of mediocrity. A year from now will anyone remember it? While X-Men fans will understandably line up to see this on opening weekend (and most will probably be pleased with the result) theres nothing about this prequel that demands a trip to the theater for those outside the die-hard circle. Its a perfectly serviceable superhero movie that hits the expected notes but thats all it is. And it offers too little thats new exciting or interesting to earn more than a ""wait for home video"" recommendation from me.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 03 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Jun. 06 2011 1105AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Really a prequel is a creation myth and from the big bangs of science to the Edenic yarns of religion we all love a good creation myth. Thats partly why X-Men First Class is such fanboy fun as the script departs from official Marvel lore to invent a whole new ""origin story"" for the mutant ensemble. Does it stretch credulity? You bet but no more than Adams rib. Whats better the fabricated stuff is blended with actual history during the height of the Cold War leaving a sombre JFK to share the screen with fire-breathing dudes and shape-shifting babes. Camelot indeed. Creation begins during the dark days of the Second World War with a study in contrast Two young males one in a Nazi concentration camp the other in a sprawling Westchester mansion. Their back stories couldnt be more different but yes they do a share a singular trait. Both are irradiated ""children of the atom"" simultaneously cursed and blessed with a potent genetic mutation. In the camp Erik witnesses the death of his mother at the barbaric hands of Dr. Schmidt. In the mansion Charles witnesses a more benign sight - another mutated kid - and exclaims in delight ""I thought I was the only one."" Flash forward to 1962 when Charles fresh out of Oxford is en route to becoming Professor X (James McAvoy); when Erik hot on the trail of his mothers killer is set to morph into Magneto (Michael Fassbender); and when that new kid on the block she of the blue epidermis is slinking her way toward Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). At this early stage theyre all still in mid-metamorphosis only partly emerged from the cocoon of normality adjusting to their peculiar talents and not yet hardened into sworn enemies. As for the evil Dr. Schmidt hes now the evil Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and seems to be deploying his superpower to manipulate the Superpowers - inveigling himself into the minds of U.S. and Soviet generals alike encouraging the former to stick nuclear missiles in Turkey the latter to plant them in Cuba. Well you know whats about to erupt. But before the near-tragedy comes the comedy. British director Matthew Vaughn who earlier tickled our funny bone in Kick-Ass takes consistent pains to put the comic into the book. The dialogue is the bantering sort thats easier to enjoy than to quote - hardly scintillating wit but definitely light and bright and quick. Also stealing a page from Bryan Singer the franchises original director and aided by the strong efforts of a uniformly solid cast Vaughn gets the pop mix just about right neither overpromoting the action nor underselling the characters. Instead as with Singer theres a delicacy to his direction that gives us room to breathe and even over the usual inflated running time reason to linger. Consequently I wont dwell on the plot but will leave you to enjoy its swirling twists and to spot the embryonic X-sters new and returning - such as Emma Frost the ice-dolly (January Jones dripping cleavage) or Wings the incendiary angel (Zoe Kravitz spewing flames). At various stages they must choose sides in the vast Marvel wars to come even while preparing for the climax here - that showdown in the Atlantic as the opposing fleets gather and the Cuban Missile Crisis flirts with meltdown. Enter JFK seen on black-and-white TV and looking awfully worried. If only hed known. Turns out that during those tense 13 days in October the world was saved not by mere Kennedys huddled in a state room but by an uberbreed taking matters into their own clawed magnetic furry or otherwise mutated hands. Historians prepare for a rewrite. Once again given the civil-rights era setting the mutant metaphor is a moveable feast representing just about any persecuted minority you care to mention - Jews in Nazi Germany blacks in the American South gays in homophobic places and of course teenagers everywhere. Repeated too is the central conceit of the mutants divided against themselves but now were present for the birth of the warring philosophies. Sequels merely ask ""And then what?"" but prequels pose the more pressing question of ""Why?"" and this one does a nice job explaining how the Professor and Magneto evolved into the Martin Luther King and Malcolm X of their race - peaceful integration pitted against vengeance by any means necessary. Ideally this pretty good beginning would make for an even better end but alas franchises dont work that way. Rather when the weekend box office shouts its tally First Class will surely double as a fresh start. So expect the worst - sequels again.

Quentin Tarantino pulp-fictionalized the Holocaust with his revenge fantasy ""Inglourious Basterds."" Now comes ""X-Men First Class"" the finest comic-book flick since 2008s ""The Dark Knight."" The saga of how the famed mutant superhero posse came to be opens in a concentration camp in Poland in 1944. A boy is separated from his mother. Restrained by guards he screams reaching out for her. The barbed-wire gate begins to quiver. Observing this hint of magnetic power is eugenicist Dr. Schmidt portrayed with reined-in sadism by Kevin Bacon. He offers the boy a chance to rescue his mother. Their negotiation is tense unfair tragic. When the camera shifts position a glass-walled laboratory of pseudo-medical misery is revealed. This is what made Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto tick -- and what keeps him so ticked off. Inglourious Mutants? Not quite but this prequel reboot of the ""X-Men"" franchise based on the Marvel comics takes seriously the possibilities of pulp entertainment. Its spirited and serious full of angst and rebellious energy. While Erik (Michael Fassbender) travels the globe hunting Schmidt (who along the way changes his identity to Sebastian Shaw and picks up some stylish suits and mutant powers of his own) future X-Men founder Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is studying genetics at Oxford. Charles and Eriks first mutant inductees are young and ""closeted."" And ""First Class"" gives self-doubt sulking and fantasies of invincibility room to breathe. It may be more glum than ""Glee"" about these matters but its just as committed. The strongest subplot about acceptance belongs to Xaviers adopted sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) who longs to be seen as her blue-skinned self not as her fetching illusion. These are the achy tensions that draw the teens among us -- and those still residing in some of us -- to the superhero genre in the first place. There are bemused nods to the ""X-men"" flicks that came before (or is that after?). And Xavier makes a passing crack about his hair; Professor X is famously bald. But this film plays taut and tight. Perhaps because so much is at stake. The action unfolds during the most tenuous moment in the Cold War -- as the U.S. and the Soviet Union face off in the waters off Cuba. Shaw makes nice and manipulates the Soviets. The mutants have joined forces (sort of) with the CIA. Its an uneasy alliance with a couple of notable exceptions. Rose Byrne portrays sympathetic agent Moira MacTaggert. Oliver Platt does typically jocular work as a CIA outlier. That ""First Class"" is top-flight shouldnt come as such a surprise though quality tent-pole movies always are. Director Matthew Vaughn and writing partner Jane Goldman who did sweet work with the underattended fantasy ""Stardust"" and provided wonderfully profane pleasures with last years ""Kick-Ass"" have a rare gift for combining fantasy vigor with tenderness. Production designer Chris Seagers captures the hipness and bureaucratic fussiness of the 1960s without overstatement except perhaps the plunging neckline of Emma Frosts white form-fitting get-up (were not complaining). January Jones (""Mad Men"") channels every James Bond femme fatale then adds a little something wavering. Casting gives this outing its rock-solid infrastructure. McAvoy makes Charles deepening friendship with Erik believably astute. Sure youd expect this from a telepath but his attempt to heal Eriks trauma is a beautiful thing. Fassbender is no longer a well-kept indie secret (""Fish Tank"" and ""Jane Eyre"") but a bona fide presence. He makes Erik and the future anti-hero Magneto worth our empathy. From the youngsters that Charles and Erik recruit to the battleship commanders teetering on the edge of nuclear war not a character is wasted. Vaughn editor Lee Smith (""Inception"" ""The Dark Knight"") and what likely was a legion of F/X whizzes deliver action that is at times impossibly impressively fluid. Which doesnt mean story is an indentured servant to flash. Sure the movies title doesnt refer to its quality. But this ""X-Men"" is absolutely first-class.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 3 2011 Save for later Saved Michael Fassbender portrays Erik Lehnsherr in a scene from X-Men First Class. Murray Close/20th Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Considering how awful the last installment was I wasnt expecting much from the new Marvel Comics-derived ""X-Men"" movie. The absence of 3-D glasses this time didnt bode well either - less diversion from the badness.The sort of good news is that Matthew Vaughns ""X-Men First Class"" is sort of good at least until it starts taking its mutants-are-a-higher-species stuff too seriously. After some early material set in Auschwitz the film settles down in 1962. It turns out that the Cuban Missile Crisis was actually fomented by mutantsWorking Auschwitz into this comic-book universe is distasteful especially when much later on the terrorized boy Erik who grows up to be Magneto proclaims ""Never Again"" (The original 2000 ""X-Men"" also began in Auschwitz.) Some universes should remain separate even in fantasy. But at least Erik/Magneto as played by Michael Fassbender is well magnetic. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Other actors have their moments too including James McAvoys telepath Charles the future Dr. X and Kevin Bacons concentration camp doctor-turned-mutant guru. He makes most Bond villains look like sissies. (This movie with its large cast should greatly enlarge the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon possibilities.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Jennifer Lawrence however who was so lacerating in ""Winters Bone"" is not given much to do except look pretty and worried as she morphs in and out of her blue-skinned red-haired yellow-eyed Mystique incarnation. If Lawrence allows herself to morph into just another franchise film hottie it will be a disaster far more calamitous than anything on view in this film.

Murray Close Michael Fassbender stars as Erik Lehnsherr in ""X-Men First Class."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Murray Close) Murray Close From left Caleb Landry Jones Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Rose Byrne Nicholas Hoult James McAvoy and Lucas Till in ""X-Men First Class."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Murray Close) ""X-Men First Class"" is a mutant movie half fun and half fearsome. For those who have developed an immunity to fanboy hype the contradictory traits may seem to weaken rather than strengthen this beast but readers of the ""X-Men"" comics will hail an origin story as satisfying as ""Thor.""Like the first ""X-Men"" movie from 2000 this prequel begins with a boy named Erik Lensherr being led to the Auschwitz concentration camp. But his life is spared by German researcher Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) because the boy is a mutant with the power of telekinetic magnetism.Meanwhile a mind-reading American boy named Charles Xavier deduces that an intruder at his family estate is a shape-shifter. Called Raven the mutant girl becomes Charles trusted companion as he embarks on an academic career in genetics. In 1962 the three mutants (played as adults by the very capable Michael Fassbender James McAvoy and Jennifer Lawrence respectively) are brought together by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) and enlisted for the Cold War. But after Charles uses his sixth sense to round up a virtual glee club of young mutants who can shriek fly fling energy bolts breathe underwater and run at supersonic speeds they realize the real enemy is not the Russians but Shaw. He too is a mutant and with his sexy sidekick Emma Frost (January Jones) he tries to provoke a nuclear war to rid the earth of unevolved humans.The setting during the Cuban Missile Crisis grounds this superhero fantasy in a perilous moment of history but director Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"") taking over the series from Bryan Singer goes overboard -- and a bit off base. When were not being strangled by symphonic foreboding were being tickled by tunes and fashions from an ""Austin Powers"" movie. Its groovy but gratuitous because nobody actually wore miniskirts or said the word ""groovy"" in 1962. The tonal imbalance mutes the intended force of the three-way clash between U.S. Russian and mutant armies even while we marvel at the sight of a submarine being levitated by Erik-cum-Magneto. The emotional conflicts are muted too as this installment has less of the anguished-outsider subtext than some other ""X-Men"" movies. Maybe that will come back like acne because even without making the honor roll ""X-Men First Class"" has earned a pass for future semesters.""X-Men First Class""Two and a half stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 211  Content Sci-fi action/violence Entertainment Watch a trailer for X-Men First Class Jun 2 2011 (...)

"New X-Men A First Class action movie - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather New X-Men A First Class action movie By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions The potential for world annihilation and the fate of the human race are at the mercy of one of pop cultures most immutable forces Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. We should have known. By Murray Close Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. Deadly games Michael Fassbender left and James McAvoy play youthful versions of Magneto and Professor X in X-Men First Class which is set in the early 1960s at the height of the Cold War. EnlargeClose By Murray Close Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. Deadly games Michael Fassbender left and James McAvoy play youthful versions of Magneto and Professor X in X-Men First Class which is set in the early 1960s at the height of the Cold War. Apparently the Cuban Missile Crisis was all Bacons doing -- or at least that of his villainous alter ego Sebastian Shaw in X-Men First Class. Actually if Bacons Shaw had his way hed have started World War III. Lest this sound ridiculous this fifth X-Men a prequel set mostly in the 1960s is a classy re-boot. For a film thats predominantly a set-up to the ongoing saga it never stints on dramatic tension. Director Matthew Vaughn knows how to pack an action movie with a stylish punch as evidenced in last years Kick-Ass. Here he revives the flagging franchise with this globe-trotting iteration infusing it with new life and dazzling visual effects. Audiences get a full sense of the compelling back stories of elder X statesmen Magneto and Professor X who have more intrinsically intriguing stories than the hirsute hero in 2009s X-Men Origins Wolverine. VIDEO Preview X-Men First Class The story by former X-Men director Bryan Singer links evil mutants -- Bacons Shaw and January Jones as Emma Frost his telepathic partner who morphs into a body made of diamonds -- to actual history. The story imaginatively alleges that Shaw and his ilk were puppet masters pulling the strings behind U.S.-Soviet conflicts. The cast is top-notch particularly James McAvoy as the calmly intelligent Charles Xavier/Professor X and Michael Fassbender as the intensely ruthless Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. We get a sense of what motivated them and see their early friendship unfold. X-Men First Class    out of four Stars James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Kevin Bacon Rose Byrne Nicholas Hoult January Jones Director Matthew Vaughn Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some sexual content including brief partial nudity and language Running time 2 hours 12 minutes Opens Friday nationwide In style and spirt this X-Men installment has more in common with James Bond movies than superhero capers. Even the music sounds Bond-esque and Fassbender would make a great Bond when Daniel Craig tires of the gig. Besides the nimble performances of McAvoy Fassbender and uber-baddie Bacon the story is powered by the high-spirited performances of the young cast particularly Nicholas Hoult as Hank/The Beast and Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique. Scenes of their training in the early days of the Xavier Institute under the tutelage of Magneto and Xavier -- and augmented by split-screen effects -- are immensely fun. However in a few sequences the youthful mutants seem transplanted from 2011 in their attitudes and phraseology. That and an overlong sometimes repetitive climactic naval clash between the U.S. Soviets and evil mutants are the movies only stumbling points. This X- Men is indeed first class an exciting bold and thoroughly enjoyable summer blockbuster. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Genocide assimilation conformity Professor Xaviers mutants can do metaphorical duty on behalf of causes and ideas aplenty. ""You didnt ask so I didnt tell"" explains one closeted young mutant in the new X-Men First Class; you half expect the guy to launch into a chorus of ""Born This Way."" Theyre mutants. Theyre here. Get over it.Getting over it isnt easy when this competent reboots tin-eared screenplay keeps reminding us in ways subtle and not so much of the social stakes. ""Mutant and proud"" boasts the young Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) as he hits on a woman at a bar and in case you didnt get the message the movie finds ample opportunity to parse the meaning and burden of being Different. Could you guys please quit debating identity politics long enough to go save the world?As X-Fans know the opposite poles of mutant philosophy are represented by Xavier the telepath who recruits young mutants to do mankind good; and Magneto (Michael Fassbender in full-on swagger mode) a Holocaust survivor with metal-bending abilities and some scores to settle against mankind. As a child Erik Lehnsherr was subjected to Mengele-like medical experiments by a sneering doctor (Kevin Bacon eliminating a few more degrees). He grows up to hunt some Nazis in Argentina -- eat your heart out Inglourious Basterds -- before begrudgingly joining the righteous mutant brigade.Lets take time out for a little history lesson. Did you know the Cuban Missile Crisis wasnt just about Kennedy Castro and Khrushchev? Thats right warring mutant factions were at the heart of the whole thing (American History X-MenAmerican History X?). In one corner the bad mutants who seek nuclear war so they can repopulate the world with their superior race. In the other corner the good mutants who just arent that into Armageddon. Yes X-Men First Class is also a Cold War thriller. Alert Dr. Strangelove a film you cant help but think of every time First Class enters the War Room.The early-60s setting provides occasion for some groovy fashion and design. January Jones gets to rock more Mad Men-era styles as Emma Frost curvaceous villainess telepath (try putting that on a business card). The first class of the title which includes Jennifer Lawrence Zoe Kravitz and Nicholas Hoult has a killer rumpus room where they get to compare super powers and dance to ""Hippy Hippy Shake"" before Xavier busts up the party. Mutants will be mutants.Heres the thing about reboots By the time they become necessary most of the important ground has already been covered. First Class is a big upgrade from the previous gasping last installment of the first series and that unfortunate Wolverine solo venture. The camaraderie among the new characters works just fine despite an interminable training montage and the retro touches add a blast of freshness (the X-Men did indeed debut in comic-book form in 1963). Director Matthew Vaughn working on a bigger canvas than his best smaller films (including Layer Cake and Kick-Ass) keeps the adrenaline surging with some nice action set pieces.None of that can keep the core ideas from tasting stale or keep the second half of the story from spinning its wheels toward the 130-minute mark. These X-Men may be the first class but you still cant help but feel theyre a little late to the party.X-Men First ClassB Starring James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Kevin Bacon January Jones Rose Byrne Zoe Kravitz and Nicholas Hoult.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies A Failing Grade to X-Men First Class The prequel has all the makings of a smart fantasy parable but it torpedoes its lofty intentions with flights of idiocy so wrongheaded as to be almost endearing By Richard Corliss June 02 2011 Share Read Later Murray Close / 20th Century Fox Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Lets say you want to take an early-summer break from the weekly onslaught of action pictures and want to trade up in quality to an art-house film. Which actors would attract you? Surely Michael Fassbender a smoldering sensation in Hunger Fish Tank Inglourious Basterds and Jane Eyre and a true MENSA heartthrob. Perhaps James McAvoy the winsome Scot who played the naive doctor to Forest Whitakers Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland and Keira Knightleys noble servant-class lover in Atonement. If these two arent the Laurence Olivier and John Gielgud of modern movies they personify better than any 30ish stars the yin-yang of Brit passion and sensitivity. Add Jennifer Lawrence the Best Actress Oscar nominee for Winters Bone and Mad Mens pretty pouty January Jones and you have an ideal cast for an uplifting transatlantic indie drama -- or since the director is Matthew Vaughn of Stardust and Kick-Ass luster the makings of a smart fantasy parable. Instead McAvoy Fassbender Lawrence Jones and several other actors with upmarket resumes (Oliver Platt Rose Byrne Kevin Bacon) are the stars of X-Men First Class a farfetched farrago meant to serve as the ""origins story"" to the 2000-2006 trilogy about the Marvel comics crew of preternatural mutants. First Class alludes not just to the earliest group of strangely gifted students assembled by their genial mastermind Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart in the other movies McAvoy here) but also to the new films self-congratulatory air. It boldly solicits reviewers blurbs proclaiming that the picture lives up to its title -- that it is less a cash cow than a sacred one equal to the eclat of its celebrated young stars. Too bad that First Class torpedoes its lofty intentions with flights of idiocy so wrongheaded as to be almost endearing. The X-Men films portrayed the battle of powerful minds even-tempered righteous Charles Xavier and the menacing Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Ian McKellen) representing all that is evil cunning and cinematically seductive. First Class transports them to their respective pre-teens when Charles was a privileged orphan in a Westchester castle and Erik a Jewish prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp where a prison doctor (Kevin Bacon) ordered the boy to ""Bend this coin with your mind or Ill kill your mother right in front of you."" Erik couldnt; the doctor did. By 1962 now in their 20s and played by McAvoy and Fassbender Charles and Erik have joined forces to assemble other diff-abled young people resolve the Cuban Missile Crisis and save the world -- a mission that conveniently coincides with Eriks obsession to avenge his mothers death by killing the doctor now a standard-issue sneering villain named Sebastian Shaw with some special powers and mutants of his own. To begin a superhero movie with the cataclysmic slaughter of one war (with the gaunt haunted faces of Jewish victims) and end it with an event that brought the world close to Armageddon (with newsreel footage of Kennedy and Khrushchev) takes well nerve. It is the films conceit in both senses of the word that the combined talents of the X-kids can avert wars and mass death; too bad they sat out Vietnam Czechoslovakia the Cultural Revolution and any number of African genocides. The problem with dreaming up a scheme this grand is that you cheat the audience by applying it selectively. First Class does. Young Erik for example needs emotional fury to stoke his disruptive potency. But a gun aimed at his helpless mom -- not to mention the knowledge that the doctor pointing it is part of a government conspiracy to eradicate his people -- isnt sufficient incentive until he sees her killed. OK hundreds of movies books plays and novels have fictionalized the Final Solution for purposes of melodrama. Were not knocking First Class for fitting Art Spiegelmans definition of Holokitsch -- though we could have done without the hint that Eriks pursuit of Schmidt/Shaw is the vengeance of all Jews on all their predators. (Eriks climactic declaration ""Never again"") But why the Cuban Missile Crisis? In part to propose Charles as the sensibly omnipotent JFK figure with Erik as a more combative Khrushchev type. And why the early 60s? Because it gave rise to three pop-cultural currents that flow in the blood of adults and kids a half-century later. The most obvious is the Marvel comics renaissance. In the first three years of that decade Stan Lee and his cohorts spawned their glorious mutants Spider-Man the Hulk Iron Man the Fantastic Four and the X-Men. But this was also the period when Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Sammy Davis and others in the Rat Pack made their jokey randomly numeraled action films Oceans Eleven Sergeants 3 Robin and the 7 Hoods. The new film cites the Rat Pack oeuvre by setting an important scene in a Las Vegas hotel where Shaws Hellfire Club meets. First Class also sets up Jones -- who in the role of the mutant ice goddess Emma Frost is a cheesecake vision in skimpy white lingerie -- as First Classs Angie Dickinson channeling Dickinsons connections to both Sinatra (she was the female lead in the original Oceans Eleven) and Kennedy. And the third pop phenomenon of 1962? The first James Bond film Dr. No which opened in London the same month as the Cuban Missile Crisis. In all but name First Class is a Bond movie from the Cold War scheming of rival superpowers to the scripts plethora of glamorous or treacherous locations -- right up to the end with an animated credits sequence very much in the spirit of Maurice Binders work on the Bonds. Above all it a handsome platinum-jawed agent Erik with Sean Connerys aplomb and Daniel Craigs ruthless determination. (In this context the more thoughtful sedentary Charles Xavier is M to Eriks Bond.) Speaking of which and with due respect to Craig Wouldnt Fassbender the macho dreamboat make a perfect oo7? Among actors of his generation Fassbender has few competitors for radiating brains and heat touch his forehead and your fingerprints burn off. I n the indie films hes made so far hes almost always been volcanic; and Vaughn obviously didnt tell him to lighten up just because this is a fantasy prequel. Apparently under the impression that this is Shakespeare not Stan Lee Fassbender exerts all his skills to transform this Magneto-in-the-making into a tragic hero. He simmers and rages cries real tears in an outsize performance that whether appropriate or not to the superhero genre dwarfs the work of his colleagues. (Has Hollywood killed superheroes?) McAvoys job as the mind-reading Charles Xavier is to keep massaging his temples like a sideshow mentalist with a migraine. Bacon has a snarky authority when he tells Charles young mutant pupils that ""You can stay and fight for the people who enslave you or follow me and live like kings"" though his tone is less Marvel 1962 than Diner 1982. But the actor is sabotaged in the big showdown by having to wear a metal helmet (to ward off Charles mind waves) that makes him look like Butters in his Professor Chaos outfit on South Park. Remember that Butters loyal assistant Dougie also in supervillain garb was known as General Disarray? Thats what First Class collapses into when Erik puts on the helmet. And the movie sinks into its own silliness with him. Its hard to be hard on any movie with Jones as a nasty bikini babe in bondage and a point-of-view shot from inside a Swiss bankers mouth as a gold filling flies out and some energetic work from the young actors who play the mutants (each of whom in the cosmic Marvel design may some day get his or her own movie) and a brief cameo by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine who when Charles Xavier comes to recruit him mutters ""Go f-- yourself."" Audiences may be grateful that they wont have to spring an extra 4 for goggles First Class is in ordinary good-looking 2-D. And even a movie that drives itself crazy with the internal contradictions of its big ideas is preferable to one that just lies there feet up like a dog taking a nap. (Yes you Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides.) But if Fassbender Jones McAvoy and Lawrence are going to be cast together in a story about bright crippled people desperately battling their demons and tearing one another part Id just as soon it were a remake of Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Starring James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Rose Byrne Director Matthew Vaughn Release Opened Jun 3 2011  Editorial Review A whole other kind of Cold War superpowerBy Ann HornadayFriday June 3 2011Judge ""X-Men First Class"" not on the color of its mutants skin but on the content of its characters.In Matthew Vaughns eagerly awaited prequel to the filmed adaptations of Stan Lees iconic comic books even the strangest-looking genetic outliers take on disarmingly human frailties quirks and admirable qualities. Charles Xavier whose benevolent persona was channeled by a paternal Patrick Stewart in previous ""X-Men"" movies turns out to have been a bit of a Carnaby Street Lothario back in the swingin London of the 1960s. Raven also known as Mystique was once just a teenage girl with skin that tended to break out (albeit in blue scales). And who knew that Magneto -- Xaviers nemesis -- could be worthy not just of understanding but sympathy?Actually ""X-Men"" fans probably know all this and theyre the ones who will be best served by ""First Class"" which begins like the comic book series itself in 1944. Thats when a young German boy named Erik Lehnsherr watches his parents being hauled off to Auschwitz. In a fit of fear and rage he bends the metal gate separating him from his family commanding the attention of a scientist eager to harness young Eriks telekinetic powers.Twenty years later the grown Erik (Michael Fassbender) contemplates his revenge against the man who went on to ruin his life and who now goes by the name of Sebastian Shaw. Meanwhile the genially telepathic Xavier (James McAvoy) is earning his doctorate in genetic research at Oxford with his shape-shifting friend and surrogate sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) by his side.Then what? Things happen taking ""First Class"" on a whirlwind tour of Las Vegas Argentina Russia Miami and finally the waters just off Cuba where -- what do you know? -- Shaw turns out to be a shadowy Cold Warrior. (Making it all the more appropriate that his primary factotum is an ice queen named Emma Frost played by January Jones.) While Erik obsessively hunts down Shaw for his own vengeful purposes Xavier meets an attractive CIA agent named Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) who enlists him to recruit genetic mutants to help her bosses stop Shaw themselves. That recruitment sequence by the way is one of the funnier passages in ""First Class"" featuring a cameo that will surely qualify as the movies most hilarious (and profane) takeaway. Mostly its a chance to see some otherwise little-known X-Men in their younger incarnations including Darwin (Edi Gathegi) Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) and Angel (Zoe Kravitz) whose web-like tattoos sprout real wings allowing her to buzz and hover like an ethereal dragonfly.Its subtitle notwithstanding though ""First Class"" is less about the rag-tag group of disaffected teen ""freaks"" whom Xavier must discipline into fighting form than about the psychodrama between him and Erik whose experience during World War II has made him more militant than the accommodationist Xavier finds comfortable. A by-any-means-necessary separatist when it comes to genetic identity Erik doesnt trust mainstream society to accord mutants full human rights. Xavier -- whose telepathic powers are more a function of extreme empathy than more supernatural gifts -- believes that assimilation is not only possible but imperative.It would all be so much fantasy-land hoo-ha were it not for the actors Vaughn has enlisted to bring the characters to life With his thumb poised along his limpid blue eyes McAvoy aptly embodies Xaviers pensive humanism. Lawrence last years breakout star in ""Winters Bone"" proves to be a voluptuous and compelling screen presence as Raven/Mystique developing a thoroughly believable chemistry with another fresh face Nicholas Hoult as a young CIA researcher named Hank McCoy. (Jones whose impassivity has bordered on the inert in similarly 60s-kitsch ""Mad Men"" here wears Frosts white-boots-and-bras with a fembots stony aplomb in another instance of pitch-perfect casting.) In all honesty though ""First Class"" belongs to one actor and thats Fassbender whose Erik/Magneto emerges as one of the most nuanced conflicted genuinely antiheroic protagonists in recent comic-book-movie memory. As a transparent and eminently watchable vessel for contradictory impulses -- vulnerability and superhuman strength victimization and destruction discipline and reckless rage -- Fassbenders Magneto is not unlike Bobby Sands the IRA activist he portrayed in the 2008 film ""Hunger."" His penultimate set piece when Magneto singlehandedly raises a submarine out of deep waters through sheer force of his will is one of those rare instances when an authentic screen performance isnt drowned out by sheer spectacle.For the most part thats true of the rest of ""First Class"" which skitters between locales and languages with sometimes confounding scattershot speed. Still ""First Class"" happily delivers on the escapism and rich narrative texture the best of its predecessors have promised. With action atmosphere and mixed feelings to burn (not to mention a few jokes about shaving Xaviers head) it seems well on its way to giving the well-traveled ""X-Men"" franchise a resuscitating breath of genetically superior nuclear-powered life. Contains intense sequences of action and violence some sexual content including brief partial nudity and profanity.

While scholars in the field of superheroism are invited to discuss the movie-vs.-comic-book cosmology of X-Men First Class until they turn as blue in the face as Mystique to a casual fan like me (who loved X-Men and X2 then chafed at X-Men The Last Stand and X-Men Origins Wolverine) the newest addition to the X-marked movie franchise fits in any of the above three categories just fine. As befits a prequel this jaunty hop-skip-jump-about variation of the saga is set in the Kennedy-era early 1960s when the peaceful young scholar with powers of telepathy who would grow up to become Professor X and the damaged young Holocaust survivor with powers of magnetism who would grow up to become Xs rival Magneto were two cocky handsome young specimens named Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender). Back then right about the time that mutants were first coming out of the closet the two were close friends rather than enemies. And to get to the headline immediately McAvoy and Fassbender are a casting triumph. These two have yes real star magnetism both individually and together Theyre both cool and intense suave and unaffected playful and dead serious about their grand comic-book work. I hope movie-studio telepaths reteam the two in the future. True with the right wormhole in place they could play Charles and Erik again but why not also pair them as spies detectives bank robbers or I dont know romantic rivals for the affections of a bawdy Kate Winslet? Where was I? Right -- as a reboot X-Men First Class re-imagines mutant power with the kind of youthful Brit-knockabout pop energy director Matthew Vaughn absorbed from his previous collaborations as producer of director Guy Ritchies bloke-y larks a spunk Vaughn most successfully demonstrated in the writing and direction of Kick-Ass. Its not just that Charles Erik and their mutant recruits (why look Theres The Hunger Games Katniss-to-be Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique) are younger; the characters are refreshingly less polished and more unpredictable too. On the downside the younger cast Lawrence included all blur into one less-than-vivid coed household. Also on the downside Mad Mens January Jones turns in a mighty frozen performance as another 1960s-coiffed platinum-blond sex object/ice queen playing competing telepath Emma Frost in the employ of the world-class villain Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). X-Men First Class provides answers to questions many audience members didnt feel compelled to ask over a decade ago when Professor X (played by Patrick Stewart in a wheelchair) and his followers first battled Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) and his Brotherhood of Mutants. Such as How did these two fellows meet? Why is the Professor in a motorized chair? Whats the real story behind the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 the toe-to-toe showdown between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that nearly launched a nuclear war? (You say JFK and Cuba never even entered your mind back when X-Men premiered? X-Men First Class explains anyway.) Here at last is the truth -- the movie truth -- of the early days. McAvoys Charles has a full head of hair and stands on his own two feet as a rich rakish Brit-about-town. And Fassbenders Erik is a trim dashing mystery man who happens to have astounding mutant powers of his own and whos scheming to use them on an evil Nazi doctor. This nasty doc (Kevin Bacon again. Hmmm I wonder if theres a connection between him and the evil Sebastian Shaw?) separated the boy Erik from his parents and turned him into his own Frankensteins monster. At first Charles and Erik are allied in their quest to recruit other young mutants -- mutants just claiming their true identities -- and to instill in them a pride and discipline that will strengthen and refine their skills for world good. Then things begin to go wrong between the two. Really wrong. In the busy cosmology invented by Vaughn and his crowded bench of co-screenwriters the Cuban Missile Crisis turns out to have mutant fingerprints all over it. But unfortunately Vaughn doesnt quite know what to do with his own considerable power as a filmmaker -- a distractibility the director copped to in an interview on the excellent British comic-book-oriented blogsite BleedingCool.com when he said ""Im terrified of doing a movie with one lead character? If somethings getting boring I can just say Lets cut to that plotline. Its hard to make sure they all come across as three-dimensional characters but at the same time I think its more interesting its easier to con an audience into thinking theres lots of interesting things happening if I can change the channel when I need to."" First Class lesson The audience delighted by McAvoy and Fassbender doesnt need conning. Theyre the most interesting (X) Men around.

X-Men First Class reviewed Mutants save the world and share their feelings. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 2 2011 523 PM X-Men First Class Mutants save the world and share their feelings. By Dana Stevens Michael Fassbender in X-Men First Class Im not even going to hazard an assertion as to whether X-Men First Class (Fox/Marvel Entertainment) is a reboot a prequel or a spinoff of the four- or five-part (depending if you count X-Men Origins Wolverine) film franchise based on the Marvel comic. No matter what I say some Marvel stickler will be mad about it. Suffice to say that the ""first class"" of the title refers not to the mutant superhero teams preferred mode of air travel but to the formation of its first graduating class. Appropriately for the season of its release this is a graduation movie but instead of caps and gowns the seniors wear a mismatched array of shiny helmets outsized prehensile feet and royal-blue scaly skin. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As all self-respecting summer blockbusters should X-Men First Class begins at the gate of a Nazi concentration camp in 1944. A young boy Erik Lensherr (Bill Milner) is being separated from his mother by SS guards. After demonstrating telekinetic powers--in his desperation the boy bends a metal gate with his mind--Erik is brought before a sadistic Nazi officer (Kevin Bacon whose first appearance on-screen gets a laugh from his sheer Baconitude). Very bad things ensue eventually resulting in the adult Erik (played by Michael Fassbender) vowing to use his extraordinary powers to find and kill the officer who is now operating as international supervillain Sebastian Shaw. Advertisement Meanwhile on a lavish estate in upstate New York a wealthy boy named Charles Xavier (Laurence Belcher) makes an astonishing discovery A little girl with the ability to shape-shift appears in his kitchen. Charles who was born with the ability to read minds realizes hes not the only kid on earth with a genetically mutated superpower and the two grow up together as siblings. The adult Charles (James McAvoy) becomes an Oxford prof specializing in genetic mutation--reason enough for him to be sought out by CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) whos attempting to convince her agency higher-ups that supermutants are for real. The audience needs no convincing once weve gotten a load of Emma Frost (January Jones) a James Bond-style villainess made entirely of crystal and other freaks of nature including a stripper with wings a goth-looking dude who uses smoke as a weapon and someone whose superpower appears to be ... being the devil? Thats a lot to keep straight and we havent yet gotten to the romance between Charles shape-shifting adopted sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and a monkey-footed mutant science whiz (Nicholas Hoult). X-Men First Class is so stuffed with subplots that even the action sequences contain cutaways to romantic contretemps On the eve of the Cuban missile crisis Raven takes some time to process her self-esteem issues. This narrative multitasking slows the pace to a sometimes agonizing degree but it also allows the director Matthew Vaughn the leisure to develop the movies only substantive relationship the contentious friendship between touchy-feely Charles Xavier and steely monomaniacal Erik. For a couple of superpowerful mutants nicknamed Professor X and Magneto these guys are astonishingly emo. They play chess on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and debate the ethics of vengeance. They weep together over a shared recollection of Eriks dead mother then cheer when the recovered memory gives Erik the strength to move a satellite dish with his mind. These ludicrous but endearing moments of bro-bonding are all that sets this otherwise stock-issue superhero movie apart from its mass-produced brethren. McAvoy and Fassbender two smart elegant heartthrobs who are usually more at home in a very different kind of literary adaptation bring a frisson of intimacy to their scenes together. They dont seem like lovers exactly (though its not hard to imagine a Magneto/Professor X slashfic site springing up in this movies wake). They seem like good friends separated by a genuine ideological rift Should mutants enlist themselves in the cause of serving humanity or break away to form a militant separatist society? By the movies end the ground has been laid for a worldwide man vs. mutant battle that will no doubt unfold in the next X-Men installment. May the best humanoid win--as long as Fassbender and McAvoy get another chance to shed their helmets lock azure gazes and cry. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Review X-Men isnt all that first class - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review X-Men isnt all that first class By Tom Charity CNN Gen X takes on a new meaning in ""X-Men First Class."" STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe ""X-Men"" franchise is back with a new film ""X-Men First Class""The characters are younger in this movie following the model of other ""prequels""January Jones Zoe Kravitz Jennifer Lawrence and James McAvoy star RELATED TOPICS X-Men First Class Movies Movie Reviews Entertainment (CNN) -- After three films and 2009s slightly lackluster spin-off (""Wolverine"") Twentieth Century Fox is hoping the ""X-Men"" franchise can extend into a second decade by injecting new blood and turning the clock back to the characters younger days. Its a strategy that paid off handsomely for JJ Abrams ""Star Trek."" ""X-Men First Class"" isnt in the same league and wont generate the same excitement but in most respects its a solid effort that maintains the integrity of this rather earnest series. Returning to the Nazi era that seems to exert such a strong pull on ""X-Men"" producer Bryan Singer the film introduces Erik Lensherr as hes being herded away from his mother by the SS at the height of WWII. The boys furious reaction brings him to the attention of a Josef Mengele-figure -- Kevin Bacon initially in German -- a scientist who believes Hitlers notion of a blond-haired blue-eyed Master Race doesnt begin to go far enough. The next time we see Erik the 60s are just starting to swing and hes played with welcome intensity by rising star Michael Fassbender (Rochester in this years excellent ""Jane Eyre"") as an angry Nazi-hunter with potent telekinetic weapons. By now his erstwhile tormentor has reinvented himself as Sebastian Shaw whose Hellfire Club is quietly shaping nuclear policy from backrooms and bedrooms in Las Vegas and Moscow. Meanwhile in England Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is just beginning to make a name for himself and earn his professorship with his groundbreaking work on genetic mutation. The battle lines for the X-Men havent really changed but not everyone has figured out on which side they belong. Nurtured by the Establishment Charles is soon co-opted by the CIA to help prevent Shaw and his allies from choreographing WWIII off the coast of Cuba. Arguably more true to his nature Erik signs on too but remains deeply cynical about how far the humans can be trusted. A bevy of promising young actors including Nicholas Hoult (""A Single Man"") Jennifer Lawrence (""Winters Bone"") and Zoe Kravitz (""Californication"") make very 1960s-style choices about being proud of their skin color (blue in Ravens case) and whether revolution trumps assimilation. Any subversive hopes that ""Kickass"" writer-director team Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn would inject some levity into the proceedings peter out pretty quickly. A wittier less vapid actress than January Jones might have vamped it up a bit as Emma Frost a telepath who models a series of scanty go-go outfits but turns to ice when you get under her skin. Theres a nice gag when the first gen-Xers come up with their ""stage names"" during something that seems suspiciously like a drunken frat party (not that we see them imbibe) but mostly the movie takes itself a shade too seriously. Except for the guy who learns how to fly by screaming nobody seems to be having much fun -- and that includes the audience. Gallery X-Men First Class Meet the mutants So far as action goes its all CGI pie- (or submarine) in-the-sky stuff impressive up to a point but never truly suspenseful. The fate of the world may hang in the balance but we have a fairly good idea of how its going to turn out. One genuinely mind-bending death scene apart Vaughns clunky staging of the green screen sequences doesnt help -- unless those echoes of ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" are intentional? But thats too harsh an assessment of a reasonably smart fairly engrossing Marvel movie. If you stuck through ""Wolverine"" youll be relieved that the Origin series seems back on an even keel. For the rest what may be most noteworthy is the consecration of a magnetic new star. The name is Fassbender Michael Fassbender and once hes got that pesky Irish brogue under control he should have an exciting career ahead of him.

Twentieth Century Fox By Joe Morgenstern June 3 2011 Preaching mutant pride with endearing fervor ""X-Men First Class"" proves to be a mutant in its own right--a zestfully radical departure from the latter spawn of a sputtering franchise. This prequel draws new energy from supersmart casting plus the shrewd notion of setting the beginnings of the X-Men saga in the early 1960s. That allows the youthful mindbenders forcefielders and shapeshifters along with their earnest Svengali Charles Xavier to reshape the Cold War. (Did you really think it was a Soviet blink that saved the world from nuclear annihilation during the Cuban Missile Crisis?) It also gives the filmmakers a chance to play with such stylistic signatures of the era as split screens Rudi Gernreich-like clothes and the beginnings of James Bond extravagance. Watch a clip from ""X-Men First Class"" starring Michael Fassbender Caleb Landry Jones James McAvoy Rose Byrne Jennifer Lawrence and Lucas Till. The film which was directed by Matthew Vaughn from a screenplay he wrote with Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz and Jane Goldman begins these beginnings with a preface that takes place in a World War II concentration camp. There a Mengele-like Nazi monster takes an interest in a Jewish boy with superpowers. No not Einstein--he could have been an X-Man but he was too old. This boys name is Erik Lensherr and he grows up in no time flat to be played by one of the main strokes of casting genius Michael Fassbender Erik will become the epitome of weaponized fury known as Magneto. More Mr. X Next-generation leading man Michael Fassbender takes a fashionably rebellious turn as this summers dashing antihero Jennifer Lawrence Unnerved by Taste of Fame Speakeasy Michael Fassbender Supervillain With a Sensitive Side Thats the fun of prequels of course--getting to see who everyone was way back when. The most enjoyable revelations include James McAvoy as the telepathic Charles touching his forefinger to his forehead and seeing deep into others brains; and Jennifer Lawrence as the blue-skinned Raven a tender adolescent having lots of trouble in the area of self-acceptance. ""I dont know whats gotten into you lately"" Charles tells her. ""Youre awfully concerned with your looks."" Kevin Bacon makes a marvelously despicable villain Sebastian Shaw His superpowers barely fit beneath the umbrella of towering evil. Rose Byrnes CIA agent Dr. Moira MacTaggert and January Joness Emma Frost pop in and out of the proceedings to lesser effect notwithstanding Ms. Byrnes startling beauty and Emmas diamond-faceted skin. Getting to see what everyone can do is fun too but only up to a point in a repetitive section devoted to recruitment and training. Training sequences always feel familiar whether the recruits are learning hand-to-hand combat with bayonets or how to focus their flames and beams on various targets. An especially laggardly passage is set at a secret CIA installation where too many mutants temporarily spoil the froth. ""X-Men First Class"" launches its way onto the big screen - reviving the comic book film franchise. Its a prequel to the previous 4 films. In it we find out just how the mutant superhero saga started. James McAvoy plays the young Charles Xavier. Video courtesy of Sky News. Still these young prodigies must test their powers before they use them. Then as the movie tells us theyve got to grow up and save their country since the White House and the Kremlin have staked the fate of the world on a game of chicken over whether the Soviets will or wont deploy nuclear missiles in Cuba. (Lurid science-fiction? Alas no historical fact.) Fortunately for their country and the world they are equal to the task. One of them even invents the extremely supersonic SR-70 Blackbird. Fortunately for the film the missile crisis puts an end to the dramatic lull. As soon as war threatens ""X-Men First Class"" regains its momentum and then some with Strangelovian twists--a circular war room a rogue vessel that cant be reached--and a climax that uses newsreel clips of President Kennedy on TV to lend credibility to an exuberant rearrangement of history. This fifth episode in the series isnt a masterpiece--one puzzlement is the uneven cinematography--but its summer entertainment of a very high grade that leaves you with an appetite for more of the same with the same core cast. And a couple of uncredited cameos turn the neat trick of being revenants from the future. Submarine ENLARGE Craig Roberts in Submarine Weinstein Company Richard Ayoades phenomenal debut feature tracks the coming of age of 15-year-old Oliver Tate a precocious English schoolboy living a life of befuddled passion inside his head while he fumbles with the realities that surround him. The film adapted from Joe Dunthornes novel and set in an unspecified but not too distant past is wonderfully funny and subversively affecting. Beyond portraying the familiar pain of adolescence--Oliver imagines his own death steeped in bathos in order to imagine his glorious resurrection--""Submarine"" provides a highly original investigation of how kids that age are trapped in the synaptic coils of self-reference. Watch a clip from ""Submarine"" starring Craig Roberts and Sally Hawkins. Oliver as played to perfection by Craig Roberts cant see his would-be girlfriend Jordana (a remarkably confident performance by Yasmin Paige) for the tentative child she is because his insufferable narcissism brings out her edgy petulance; she could pass for a dominatrix in training. Sally Hawkins is Olivers mother Jill a ramrod-rigid neurotic who wanted to be an actress until someone said her tongue was too big for her mouth. (Her sons mind is too big for his skull.) Noah Taylor is Olivers father Lloyd a marine biologist and marital jellyfish. (Drowning in depression Lloyd treats his son like a valued but distant friend.) Just about every member of the cast flirts with perfection but the one who woos and wins it most spectacularly is Paddy Considine as the Tates next-door neighbor Graham a two-bit New Age guru whom Oliver sees as a superstar instead of the fatuous peacock that he is. Mr. Ayoade the writer-director is anything but self-referential. He seems to have taken inspiration from such diverse sources as Danny Boyle Richard Lester Francois Truffaut ""Amelie"" and ""A Taste of Honey."" (Ms. Paiges Jordana reminded me of Rita Tushinghams poignantly spunky Jo.) Still ""Submarine"" is one of a kind. The twin prongs of its plot consist of Olivers efforts to save his parents marriage from the threat of Grahams adulterous allure and to woo and win Jordana. But the films singular essence is its evocation of the scintillating intellect the immature judgment and the emotional maelstrom that constitute Olivers inner life. Beginners ENLARGE Melanie Laurent and Ewan McGregor in Beginners Focus Features Another Oliver played by Ewan McGregor occupies center stage in ""Beginners"" which was written and directed by Mike Mills. This Oliver is well past adolescence at least chronologically. He shares the stage with his father Christopher Plummers Hal who looms larger in death than he did in life. (Both performances are superb and through the sons self-questioning and the fathers self-dramatizing beautifully complementary.) The story Mr. Mills tells has a strong autobiographical component; his father came out at the age of 75 and embraced the life of a gay man after living with his mother for 45 years. The film is stylistically self-conscious almost to a fault and almost unmanageably ambitious. Theres a sense of the filmmaker trying to get his mind around the whole culture that produced him as well the parents who put their indelible stamp on his psyche. Yet the films special mixture of sadness comedy and hope sneaks up on you and stays in your memory. Watch a clip from ""Beginners"" starring Ewan McGregor and Christopher Plummer. Sadness threatens to be Olivers constant life companion. As the child of emotionally opaque parents he has either kept the women in his life at a distance or run away from them when intimacy threatened. Comedy flows often ruefully from Hals late-life eruption of heedless love for a partner of dubious fidelity. So does hope though. Mr. Mills holds out a chance if only a chance that the son may learn from his fathers unexpected example in the course of Olivers new relationship with Anna a lovely eccentric whos played by Melanie Laurent. (She was the theater owner in Quentin Tarantinos ""Inglourious Basterds."") For all the feyness of her behavior at first Anna is so original and poignantly beautiful that she could inspire hope in a heart of stone. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE The Fury (1978) I recommended Brian De Palmas crazed and mesmerizing thriller when the first ""X-Men"" came out 11 years ago but its worth noting again for its close resemblance to the ""X-Men"" premise. Robin and Gillian the young people with superpowers--their specialty is telekinesis--are played by Andrew Stevens and Amy Irving. Their fate will be determined either by the governmental heavy played by John Cassavetes (he wants to exploit them) or by Robins father an ex-CIA operative played by Kirk Douglas. (He of course wants to save them.) The cast includes Carrie Snodgress Charles Durning and Carol Rossen. ENLARGE Carrie (1976) More superpowers from Brian De Palma this time in high school in a screen version of a Stephen King novel thats become a horror classic. Sissy Spacek is the telekinetic title character a misfit who can move mountains--or masses of kids at a prom--when shes moved strongly enough by anger. Piper Laurie is Carries bible-thumping mother. The extraordinary cast includes John Travolta Amy Irving William Katt and Nancy Allen. Mario Tosi did the elegant cinematography. The production was designed by Jack Fisk (who designed Terrence Malicks new film ""The Tree of Life"") and William Kenney. ENLARGE The 400 Blows (1959) Just in case youve forgotten Francois Truffauts debut feature is one of the seminal coming-of-age stories of world cinema. Jean-Pierre Leaud is Antoine Doinel the filmmakers comically--and not-so comically--troubled surrogate who skips school gets into and out of trouble builds a secret shrine to Balzac and ends up in one of the best-known shots in movie history a freeze frame on a beach. Albert Remy and Claire Maurier play Antoines parents. Henri Decae did the black-and-white cinematography which was remarkably fluid and free for its time. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"X-Men First Class Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review X-Men First ClassMultiple plots overreaching effects and ancillary characters derail the latest installment of the comic-fantasy franchise set in the 1960s.June 03 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic As Charles (James McAvoy) watches Erik (Michael Fassbender) wields his... (Murray Close / Twentieth...)It would take a brain far more telepathically powerful than that of Professor X to untangle what went wrong with ""X-Men First Class"" but misplaced and misplayed ambition to say nothing of a massive misspent budget comes to my nonmutant mind. The latest edition of the sprawling action-comic-fantasy epic takes us back to the future with moments of greatness. But those flashes of amazing are fleeting ultimately undone by a frustrating mire of multiple plots overreaching special effects leaden ancillary players and world-ending military standoffs that have all the tension of a water balloon fight. The film stars James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender two ""First Class"" standouts as Professor X and Magneto in the 60s when they were just a couple of mutants working through their power issues. But there is more so much more a| a back story about the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis; a subplot tied to an evil Nazi mutant (Kevin Bacon doing vile particularly well); a running teen coming-of-age bit featuring some X-Men mutant favorites; a CIA-in-conflict story; a U.S. colonel compromised by lingerie models; and a few more threads Im probably forgetting. The stories unfold in a deep breath a Auschwitz New YorkEngland Argentina Las Vegas Miami Moscow somewhere outside of Moscow Virginia under the ocean in the sky on the ground underground under polar icecaps and in several undisclosed locations. At times it feels like someone was playing spin and point with an old globe of the world. British director Matthew Vaughn somehow lets everything get away from him which is unlike most of his well-calibrated early work from his 2005 debut ""Layer Cake"" to 2009s ""Harry Brown"" which he produced. The script is from a team whose players included Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz and Jane Goldman and Vaughn (they collaborated on ""Kick-Ass"" among others). The film begins with such promise a near perfect re-creation of the powerful Auschwitz scene that opened the original ""X-Men"" in 2000. Its when Magneto was a boy heartbreakingly separated from his parents at the prison gates his metal-twisting powers unleashed but too late to save them. We get the next terrible chapter in that book now which introduces us to Sebastian Shaw (Bacon) as a Nazi big shot with an operating room next to his office and a persuasive gun who presses Erik into service. It plants the seeds of revenge and mistrust that will drive Erik the rest of his days. At the same time across the world things are a lot easier for Charles living a life of ease in the Westchester mansion in upstate New York that will eventually become the school for ""gifted"" children. He has been awakened during the night and finds someone who looks like his mother in the kitchen suspicious since she doesnt cook. It turns out of be the shape-shifting Raven (""Winters Bones"" Jennifer Lawrence) then just a little lost blue girl. In short order (though not short enough) Charles is teaching at Oxford Erik is scouring Argentina for Shaw Shaw is in his Vegas gentlemens club with diamond-queen Emma Frost (January Jones) trying to force Colonel Hendry (Glenn Morshower) to help with Shaws Bay of Pigs scheme while new CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne who is proving to be a versatile actress) strips down to black lacy nothings to go undercover. Its a frenzied pace but when Vaughn does slow things down good things begin to surface. The excellent McAvoy (""Atonement"" ""Last King of Scotland"") is a total charmer as the young genius already dedicated to protecting and forgiving the human race. The intense Fassbender (a darkly romantic Rochester in ""Jane Eyre"") opens a window into Eriks pain as well as his need for friendship. The actors play off each other in ways that make their emotional connection palpable. But before it can develop into something truly meaningful the story is off and running again to a Russian outpost or the special CIA MIB compound run by Oliver Platts MIB (stands for man in black suit a.k.a. men in black get it?). McAvoy Fassbender and Bacon continuing his good work streak are a potent mutant trio locked in an escalating series of good-versus-evil battles. Those fights involve all sorts of large-scale special effects a the digital overseen by John Dykstra (""Spider-Man"" and others); the physical created by Chris Corbould (""Inception"" and more). Though hes given a lot of massive action sequences to play with cinematographer John Mathieson (""Gladiator"") makes the smaller more intimate moments the most affecting. Sprinkled between the big and small are a series of clever nods to ""X-Mens"" cinematic past lives and lore that are tongue in cheek cleverly done and sure to be crowd pleasers. Less pleasing are all the other mutants who will have to choose sides a swath of young Hollywood talent badly squandered including Lawrences Raven Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Angel (Zoe Kravitz) Havoc (Lucas Till) and the list goes on. As does the film a tedious two-plus hours. There were such possibilities in the origins idea. Maybe if filmmakers had slipped on Cerebro that mystical mind-enhancing metal helmet for a bit; it seemed to help everyone else. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESShames Michael Fassbender Steve McQueen on a serious...November 27 2011New on DVDSeptember 6 2011Movie Review Green LanternJune 17 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentMichael FassbenderMagnetoMatthew VaughnCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-x-men-20110603,0,699088.story?track=rss",200,x-menfirstclass20,x-menfirstclass,latimes

You want me to believe a guy can rotate a radar array with his brain waves? That another guy can read minds just by massaging his temple? Fine. Ill even believe that a man (rather an annoying teenage boy) can fly by screaming. But my fantasy-support system crashes in a heap Im afraid when asked to believe that someday James McAvoy actually matures into Patrick Stewart. Deepens his voice. Acquires stentorian Shakespearean gravity. And umm loses all his hair. Pro forma bald jokes appear in the screenplay for X-Men First Class the fifth movie in the Marvel mutant franchise and the first since 2009s overwhelmingly blah Wolverine. This new entry directed by the energetic Matthew Vaughn of Kick-Ass is never blah. Uneven occasionally silly -- true but its still an improvement over 2006s X-Men The Last Stand. As much a reboot as a sequel First Class zips back to the origins of Professor X the goodly telepath played by McAvoy and Magneto the telekinetic friend-slash-antagonist played by broody leading man Michael Fassbender (Jane Eyre). Fassbender doesnt look much like his predecessor in the role Ian McKellen but both men have a slippery charisma that fits Magneto like a glove. As a German-Jewish Holocaust survivor Magneto offers the darkest and most compelling part of the story back in 1944 little Erik Lehnsherr watches his mother die at the hands of a vicious Nazi scientist (Kevin Bacon) who then takes him under his wing teaches him to exploit his powers and turns him into Frankensteins monster. Meanwhile over in posh Westchester County New York the wee Charles Xavier spots a fellow mutant named Raven raiding the fridge in his mansion. Shes a shape-shifter. In her natural state shes all scaly and blue (a nice Avatar cerulean) but shes too ashamed to go ""mutant and proud"" in a world that looks down on genetically altered freaks. Raven grows up into Winter Bones Jennifer Lawrence - a sad smart creature - while Charles turns into an aggravatingly foppish McAvoy. By then its 1962 the eve of the Cuban Missile Crisis and Bacons nasty Nazi scientist has acquired a perfect American accent and a yacht full of bad mutant sidekicks in his world-conquering crackpot quest to squish humans like insects. You know what? This is starting to sound a lot like a James Bond movie. Its starting to look like one too especially when Bacon retreats to his war-room in double-breasted suits with a fabulously dim gun moll played by January Jones. Shes Emma Frost a mutant telepath who shape-shifts into a gazillion-carat diamond. (And yes she has the same blank expression whether shes mouthing dialogue or just staring mutely while her brain does the talking.) The Bond business is good fun especially when Magneto sneaks on board to confront his creator. Had Fassbender stripped to a tux I would not have been surprised. But then X-Men First Class moves on to the less-thrilling matters of CIA politicking (Rose Byrne plays a sympathetic agent) U.S.-Soviet tensions and a worldwide mutant-recruiting effort in which Professor X and Magneto enlist the ""first class"" of pimply young mutants. These two are harder to swallow as friends than enemies - their bonding seems forced their chemistry sparkless - but theyre easier to take than the screaming teen. And more believable by a long shot than Xaviers hair. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Apple Sale at eBay Up to 60% off + free shipping Polo Ralph Lauren Mens Shoes for 20 + 5 samp;h Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

More about X-Men First Class >> Toward the maelstrom climax of X-Men First Class - set in 1962 with President John F. Kennedy and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev squaring off in a nightmare game of nuclear chicken - the truth about what really happened off the southern tip of Florida is revealed. The dramatic action sheds a whole new light on those dread-filled days that October when the world looked like it would be covered in mushroom clouds - and for that director Matthew Vaughn and his team should be thanked. Of course history books will have to be rewritten but hey thats life. This was also the time it should be noted when James Bond was combing nearby Caribbean waters for Dr. No and in fact it looks as though Vaughn went combing through early 007 films too to come up with the look and style of X-Men First Class. Jennifer Lawrence the hoodied Ozarks girl of Winters Bone in miniskirts and go-go boots? Yup. Michael Fassbender brooding Rochester in the new Jane Eyre in mod turtlenecks and sideburns? Check. An elaborate origins story with more datelines than an issue of Conde Nast Traveler (Oxford Miami Argentina Poland) X-Men First Class has some fun trying to explain how Professor X Magneto and all those mopey mutants came to be. Its a mess of backstory to contend with Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is graduating from Oxford a budding brainy geneticist who picks up babes by complimenting them on their ""groovy"" genomes. Erik Lehnsherr (Fassbender) is a concentration camp survivor determined to track down the Nazi sicko who exploited his magnetic mind powers. Kevin Bacon an evil gleam in his eye and a Berlitz class worth of German in his mouth plays Sebastian Shaw the sinister Teuton. Sending millions of Jews to their death only whetted this guys appetite for destruction. And theres Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) the blue-skinned beauty who becomes Mystique; and Hank (Nicholas Hoult) the science whiz who becomes Beast; and Cassidy (Caleb Landry Jones) whose sonic scream gives him the moniker Banshee and January Jones all vintage va-va-va-voom as a telepath. (Shes pneumatic and psionic.) Not to mention Azazel and Riptide and Angel whom we wont mention. As prequels go then X-Men First Class has its hands full. Oliver Platt and Rose Byrne show up (the latter in lingerie to blend in with a bevy of lap-dancing call girls) as CIA agents trying to figure out whats up with these weirdos - and to help with the exposition. For a time Vaughn - who seemed considerably less encumbered with his previous superhero outing Kick-Ass - keeps things afloat. McAvoy and Fassbender are serious actors and seem to be having a serious good time inhabiting these extraordinary Marvel Comics creations. But theres just so much you can do with lines like ""Youre not alone Eric youre not alone"" and ""the presidents about to make his address"" before you get sucked into the vortex.

X-Men First Class (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review X-Men First Class (PG-13) The origins of the mutant superheroes make for a rousing exciting comic-book adventure Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald6/28/2011 Editor rating 3 Marvel Comics diehards may squirm in frustration over the flagrant liberties the filmmakers have taken with the X-Mencanon. But for everyone else X-Men First Class is an uncommonly polished and sophisticated superhero movie in which the characters are so strong you sometimes forget youre watching a story about telepaths and men who can bend steel with their minds. In his previous picture Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn deconstructed the comic-book genre delivering a satire that was affectionate yet deeply subversive. With First Class though Vaughn sets aside all the irony and comes up with one of the best X-Men movies (second only to X-Men 2) by going back to the beginning in the 1960s when mutants were becoming more frequent after the nuclear testing of the atomic age. Kids growing up with bizarre talents such as the ability to shape shift or shoot laser beams from their hands keep their skills hidden afraid of being ostracized and outcast. As tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union escalate a CIA agent (Rose Byrne) recruits the help of telepath Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) to see if this growing number of odd humans can be put to use to defend the country. Meanwhile Holocaust survivor Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender) who has the ability to manipulate metal is hellbent on tracking down Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) the Nazi officer who murdered his mother in front of his eyes and used him for medical experiments. The eventual friendship between Charles and Erik who will eventually be known as Magneto is one of most appealing aspects of X-Men First Class. Weve seen these two old foes at odds for so long that watching them working together to round up a team of young frightened mutants and honing their skills is highly entertaining (Imagine the Joker and Batman suddenly making nice and helping each other.) Schmidt who wants to lead the this country and Russia into a nuclear war in order to strengthen the powers of mutants everywhere and rid the world of puny humans is played a bit broadly by Bacon although his orchestration of the Cuban Missile Crisis is a clever intersection of history and pure fantasy. The young mutants played by Jennifer Lawrence (the blue-skinned Raven) Nicholas Hoult (Beast) and others are all fine but the true stars of the film are McAvoy and Fassbender who credibly depict how Xavier and Magneto could go from being such tight allies to mortal enemies.Vaughn pulls off some astounding set pieces -- Magnetos lifting a giant submarine from the ocean is a jaw-dropping highpoint -- but this is the rare kind of comic-book adaptation in which youre equally entertained when the characters are just sitting around talking. The X-Men series seemed to have reached its end with the crummy third installment The Last Stand but First Class injects energy and life into the franchise and opens the door for a slew of potential sequels. Plus you also get the most amusing cameo of the year thus far. Nuff said.

The Star Tribunes Colin Covert raves about ""13 Assassins."" Matt Gillmer Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint There are so many things going right in ""X-Men First Class"" that you can almost overlook its glaring faults. A richly layered intelligently worked-out prequel it melds a dozen back stories globe-hopping thrills and historic political confrontations yet it never packs too many sardines into the tin. The film has a mature confidence rarely seen in comic-book fare with powerful drama and throwaway wit in perfect balance. The film gives a fresh start to the X-Men story line with its mutant heroes alienated from human society. Director/co-writer Matthew Vaughn introduces his parallel protagonists with swift sure strokes. In a World War II prologue young Erik Lehnsherr who will become Magneto discovers his telekinetic powers at the hands of a sadistic Nazi scientist. Half a world away Charles Xavier the future Professor X is raised amid wealth and comfort using his telepathic gifts to calm and help an outcast girl. The seeds of the characters planted the tale skips ahead two decades. Erik uses his powers to hunt down the Nazis who killed his parents executing them without remorse. ""Im Frankensteins monster looking for my creator"" he tells one fugitive war criminal before dispatching him. Charles a young college lecturer turns his empathic skills to advantage in his extracurricular womanizing. Neither is a clear-cut villain or hero and when they meet their differences are simply philosophical disagreements between close friends. The duo are recruited by the CIA to locate others of their kind who can help combat Soviet aggression. As they gradually encounter younger peers Charles envisions a world where mutants and humans peacefully coexist. Erik sees humans as persecutors and mutants as the next step in evolutionary progress. Their true natures are tested by a power-mad mutant bent on inflaming U.S.-Russian tensions into a nuclear holocaust. The film races ahead like a thoroughbred thriller with every action sequence logically motivated by the story. Murray Close 20th Century Fox Michael Fassbender plays Erik Lehnsherr in ""X-Men First Class."" The tale is ideally served by returning to the early 1960s. The films production design has a sleek retro allure; the look of the U.S. war room is a direct nod to ""Dr. Strangelove"" and the costumes are slim-cut hip and sexy if slightly anachronistic (miniskirts and men with long hair were still years away). Setting the action at the dawn of the civil rights movement and feminism gives the story social and political significance thats relevant even now. When one closeted mutant on the CIA payroll clarifies why he has kept his powers secret he explains ""They didnt ask I didnt tell."" A film so dependent on character dynamics needs fine actors in its lead roles. James McAvoy is superb as Charles playing the patient good-humored idealist with delicacy. Michael Fassbender is coolly charismatic rueful and lethal as Erik. The actors are both in their early 30s but McAvoy still carries some baby fat in his cheeks while Fassbender has a lean wolfish look. Over the course of the film they round up five teen mutants who are thinly characterized and the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) who appears to be a blond blue-eyed angel because she uses her camouflage abilities to hide her natural appearance. The biggest problem with the film is the nemesis. Kevin Bacon plays Dr. Schmidt the concentration-camp physician who unlocks Eriks rage and thus his magnetic abilities. From the moment he appears onscreen speaking ill-accented German Bacon strikes a false note. Hes equally unconvincing in the 1960s chapter of the film reincarnated as a lounge lizard Bond baddie named Sebastian Shaw. Dressed in mod splendor and swilling cocktails his performance drips oily excess. Hes also saddled with an illogical and unexplained transformation. Somehow he has acquired mutant powers of his own which punctures the crucial plot point that humans and mutants are on separate evolutionary tracks. Still the four-way faceoff between heroic and evil mutants and the U.S. and U.S.S.R. during the missile blockade is as taut and thrilling a showdown as weve seen in months. In almost every important regard the new ""X-Men"" is first-class indeed.

"X-Men First Class movie review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs In a crowd one stands outMichael Fassbender lends gravitas to a predictably middling X-Men prequel -- 2.5 starsJune 02 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticPrimarily for dues-paying ""X-Men"" club members in good standing rather than anyone wandering by a multiplex wondering if the prequel stands on its own ""X-Men First Class"" settles for moderately engrossing second-class mutant superheroism. Plus it includes January Jones as Emma Frost here depicted as Austin Powers dream shag and Rose Byrne as a perpetually aghast CIA operative.Mainly though the film features Michael Fassbender in a pivotal role. Thats enough to lift it above the mechanics of the routine.If you dont know the name you may know the face. Recognizable from ""Hunger"" ""Inglourious Basterds"" and the recent ""Jane Eyre"" the German-born Irish-bred Fassbender brings a dash of authority and brio to every assignment. In ""X-Men First Class"" theres a moment when his character -- Erik Lehnsherr survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto a so-called mutant who can bend metal at will -- tests out his long-distance ability to rotate counterclockwise a massive satellite tower. Fassbenders required to strike ""the pose"" i.e. fingers on both hands spread out in Zap Position ready to perform the magnetizing feat of wonder furrowed brow in full furrow gaze intent.Its the kind of bit that can make even a skilled actor look like an idiot. Yet Fassbender does not look like an idiot. He looks as if hes been bending hunks of metal with his mind regularly just for practice.Directed with bland efficiency by Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"") ""X-Men First Class"" juggles a massively full roster of mutants as it heads toward the finish line and the answer to the question What really happened to provoke and then narrowly avert the 1962 Cuban missile crisis? When Fassbender in the role played by Ian McKellen in earlier ""X-Men"" outings is allowed some elbow room you notice and appreciate whats at stake. And when the many-hands screenplay lets him match wits with future nemesis Charles Xavier played by James McAvoy the film snaps into focus.The story cooked up by Bryan Singer exploits both the Holocaust and the Cold War for its own ends as did the Marvel Comics originals. The evil mastermind behind the Cuban missile gambit starts out a generation earlier as a Mengele-like Nazi doctor introduced by the movie in a 1944 concentration camp prologue. Both iterations of the character are played by Kevin Bacon in full ferret mode. How does this material square with the funsy 62-set training sequences where we see the proto-X-Men and -Women testing out their various transformational and destructive abilities? Not very easily.First under CIA tutelage (Oliver Platt plays their overseer) and then in the confines of Xaviers remote mansion the mutants must learn to marshal their abilities. I confess I find it hard to keep everybodys superpowers straight with this franchise. Its like learning the names of every one of your childs classmates. The good mutants include cobalt-blue Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) the boy-man with hands for feet known as Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and many others. The story hops and skips from Moscow to Vegas to England to Cuba. The film improves on the heavy-spirited ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" of two years ago. Still the deadliest single element in this film can be traced not to Bacons character but to composer Henry Jackson whose music seems determined to kill us all with waves of dramatic nothingness.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of action and violence some sexual content including brief partial nudity and language)Cast James McAvoy (Charles); Michael Fassbender (Erik); Kevin Bacon (Sebastian/Dr. Schmidt); Rose Byrne (Moira); January Jones (Emma Frost); Oliver Platt (MIB); Jennifer Lawrence (Raven/Mystique)Credits Directed by Matthew Vaughn; written by Ashley Edward Miller Zack Stentz Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughn; produced by Lauren Shuler Donner Bryan Singer Simon Kinberg and Gregory Goodman.

Yet its not the artistry of X-Men First Class thats particularly striking; though its finely crafted the film feels less the product of a visionary director than of the Marvel movies machine working at maximum efficiency. Whats really awe-inspiring about X-Men First Class is akin to whats startling about watching a sideshow strongman lift a refrigerator over his head. Just re-energizing a moribund franchise would be enough of a burden but director Matthew Vaughn and his battery of screenwriters have also been tasked with rebuilding the entire X-Men universe from scratch. Origin stories can be deadly -- were looking at you Star Wars prequels -- because theyre about setup more than follow-through. By that measure X-Men seems especially perilous given its many dozens of specialized mutants and the convoluted allegiances and rivalries among them. Its a headache just to consider the logistics of squeezing all that business into one movie but the small miracle of X-Men First Class is that it pulls off this herculean feat without breaking a sweat. Rather than feeling hampered by the need to introduce the likes of Magneto and Professor X to an audience that knows them through three previous blockbusters -- to say nothing of comics video games action figures and other ancillary products -- the filmmakers seem to have seized the opportunity to start fresh with a new cast and a cleaner stronger mythology. Harnessing a wealth of pulpy energy from real human events X-Men First Class cleverly incorporates the X-Men into a shadow history of the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis. But first it turns to the ultimate pulp villains -- Nazis -- to raise the stakes all the more. Flashing back to Auschwitz it recaps the tale of young Erik Lensherr who discovers the powers that will later transform him into Magneto when Nazi doctor Sebastian Shaw played delectably by Kevin Bacon guns down his mother. From that moment on Eriks anger and impulsiveness will contrast starkly with his future friend and eventual nemesis Charles Xavier aka Professor X who manages his telepathic powers with intelligence and restraint.

Murray Close/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Murray Close/Twentieth Century Fox Fassbender (left) Caleb Landry Jones James McAvoy Rose Byrne Jennifer Lawrence and Lucas Till are all mutants -- but not always on the same side. Murray Close/Twentieth Century Fox Jumping ahead to 1962 with James McAvoy as Xavier and a mesmerizing Michael Fassbender as Erik the film brings the two mutants together in an effort to avert global catastrophe. After a postwar lay-low in Argentina Bacons Sebastian has assembled a team of mutant neer-do-wells including the telepathic Emma Frost (January Jones in brittle Mad Men form) and sets out to provoke a U.S.-Soviet nuclear conflict that will thin the ranks of ordinary humans. Recruited by the CIA for a ""Division of Mutant Powers"" aimed at countering the threat Xavier and Erik put together a mutant army of their own mainly stocked with young unrefined talent -- mutants well come to know but before theyre called such names as Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) Beast (Nicholas Hoult) and Havok (Lucas Till). On top of everything else X-Men First Class introduces an experimental serum designed to turn the mutants into ordinary humans -- but really the Cuban missile crisis is effective enough at stoking the identity issues built into the X-Men mythos. As evil plots go the idea of escalating Cold War tensions in an effort to eradicate humanity is pleasingly outrageous but it also complicates the mutants struggle to integrate with other people or reject them entirely. This division among the mutants will likely be central to future X-Men movies and First Class sets the table swiftly and clearly. In the end that clarity is the films greatest asset because its a giant contraption built from an awful lot of moving parts. That Vaughn and company have time to sprinkle in witty references to X-Men marginalia -- and delight too in the shagadelic details of the swinging 60s -- speaks to the integrity of their blueprint. With X-Men First Class getting the heavy lifting out of the way the sequels will presumably cut loose -- but it wont be easy for them to have this much fun doing it.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres something special about origin stories. While sequels have their own compulsive power for studios and filmmakers--mostly the lure of a built-in audience--""becoming"" stories where characters go through their greatest transformations are so inherently compelling that comics films and TV shows frequently restart franchises from scratch just to get a new crack at an old origin. That certainly explains X-Men First Class which packs around a dozen origin stories into one crowded world-spanning two-hour-plus action film designed to launch a new X-Men trilogy. And yet director Matthew Vaughn and his many screenwriting partners (including X-Men and X2 director Bryan Singer with a ""story"" co-credit) manage to maintain admirable coherence and propulsive pacing throughout. Tossing out the previous X-Men movies continuity they jump back a generation beginning in the 1940s with mutant leader Charles Xavier as a neglected but fantastically rich telepathic child who befriends the shape-changing intruder Raven and Magneto-to-be Erik Lehnsherr a concentration-camp prisoner with control over metal a power that gains him the possessive evil attentions of mutant mastermind Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Charles childhood of privilege and power leaves him smug but bent on helping other troubled mutants; Eriks youthful misery focuses him utterly on revenge against Bacon. As adults played by James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender respectively they both get involved in a drive to recruit more mutants to counter Shaws outsized supervillain plotting which weaves through the real history of the Cuban Missile Crisis complete with footage of JFKs speeches sprinkled throughout. First Class cast is a sprawling collection of recognizable faces playing roles that will be familiar to comics readers notably Rose Byrne as CIA agent Moira MacTaggert Jennifer Lawrence as Raven/Mystique and an embarrassingly rigid January Jones as scantily clad telepath Emma Frost. Vaughn and company navigate the complications of all their stories by breaking the movie down into a few heavily underlined well-established X-Men themes particularly adolescent confusion and self-rejection (clarified and externalized by expression through physical deformity and accompanying immense power) and the difficult decision of whether to strike back against a harshly judgmental world rally to improve it or try to integrate quietly into it. And once again the touchstones of modern Marvel movies emerge in-jokes and deep-geekery references for die-hard comics fans broader gags for the mainstream and breathtaking special-effects setpieces for both ends of the spectrum. First Class embraces a few embarrassing cliches the few non-Caucasian characters are all dead or evil by halfway through the film and a handful of already-ridiculous lines get infused with operatic laughable portent that clash with the movies otherwise more humanistic take on the superhero genre. But First Class largely does what it sets out to do by turning out another crowd-pleasing comic-book film designed to bring in new fans while gratifying the old ones.

Comments (2) click to enlarge X-Men First Class Video Rated PG-13  132 minutes  2011 Like Bryan Singers X2 (2003) this fifth entry in the X-Men franchise is noteworthy for its gay-rights subtext and for its noted actors (Michael Fassbender James McAvoy Jennifer Lawrence) delivering comic book dialogue with Shakespearean portent. Otherwise its indistinguishable from most other recent blockbusters--crammed with ideas in the first hour and with digitally animated explosions in the second. The prequel story line explains how the famous mutants first met under the auspices of the CIA during the lead-up to the Cuban Missile Crisis. The notion of a period-piece comic book movie which could fancifully reshuffle historical episodes has great potential but neither the cast nor the filmmakers aim for the sort of period detail that would have made the premise interesting.

Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox Film/Murray Close advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The Cold War origin story of the mutant superheroes. BOTTOM LINE Fun fast and stylish; extra points for smarts too. CAST James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence Kevin Bacon WHEN/WHERE Opening Friday at area theaters with some midnight showings Thursday night. LENGTH 210 Marginalization persecution assimilation -- are these themes too weighty for a summer superhero flick? Not for ""X-Men First Class"" the first such film since 2008s ""The Dark Knight"" that has something on its mind other than lavish effects and high decibels. ""X-Men First Class"" rewinds to the Cold War 1960s -- the era in which the comics launched -- to show us the mutant superheroes in their youth. The future Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) is a callow collegian who uses his telepathy to woo coeds; the metal-bending Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is a Holocaust survivor hunting down his torturer the elusive Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). advertisement | advertise on newsday Other alienated youths appear including the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) and Angel (Zoe Kravitz) whose butterfly wings arent just a tattoo. Some characters like the literal ice queen Emma Frost (January Jones) fall victim to overcrowding; even at two hours and 10 minutes the film cant properly attend to everyone. The story centers on the delightful notion that evil mutants planned the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis just one example of the films irreverent humor. Director Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"") also has fun shifting between wood-paneled offices (shades of ""Mad Men"") and modish villains lairs straight from the Bond films. But nobody is having a better time than Bacon who transforms from Nazi doctor to Miami kingpin to atomic monster. Partly written by Bryan Singer the openly gay filmmaker who helped launched this franchise in 2000 ""X-Men First Class"" is loaded with subtexts though you dont need to belong to a culturally designated minority for the film to resonate. You could just be a plain old moviegoer looking for intelligent entertainment.

"X-men First Class review Reboot of mutant franchise is strictly for fans |       NJ.com comments X-men First Class review Reboot of mutant franchise is strictly for fans Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 02 2011 at 801 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1055 AM View/Post Comments Murray Close and Twentieth Century Fox Film CorporationBanshee (Caleb Landry Jones) Magneto (Michael Fassbender) Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) Moira (Rose Byrne) Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Dr. Xavier (James McAvoy) and Havoc (Lucas Till) join forces to prevent the greatest disaster the world has ever known. It may be a new tradition in superhero movies -- the first film sets the bar high the second pushes things too far and the third runs the whole franchise into the ground. And then the fourth starts things all over again with a ""re-boot."" Thats the game plan for the upcoming ""Spider-Man"" with Andrew Garfield. And its the idea behind the latest ""X-Men First Class"" both a prequel to the series and a fresh start. Its a good idea. Casual fans will probably be interested in finding out why Professor Xavier and Magneto first became enemies who crippled Xavier and how he founded his academy for mutants. And some of the truly ""X""-obsessed may enjoy debating how the script remaps the Marvel universe (there are characters in this origin story who didnt show up in the comic for years). As for those who dont know their X-Men from their Watchmen -- well its unlikely theyll go anyway so the filmmakers dont need to worry about them. Movie Review X-Men First Class (PG-13) Fox (132 min.) Directed by Matthew Vaughn. With James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Jennifer Lawrence. Opens across New Jersey tomorrow; many theaters will offer midnight showings tonight. Rating note The film contains violence brief strong language mild sensuality and mutant nudity. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALFSTARS The moviemakers do need to worry however about providing us with strong characters and lots of eye-candy. And ""X-Men First Class"" does only a second-rate job of delivering. More than most Marvels ""X-Men"" is about the coolness -- fascinating heroes with extraordinary powers. (Yes theres the usual Stan Lee angst but a lot of that comes from Wolverine -- who only has a jokey cameo in this episode.) Yet given that simple strict order -- astonish us -- ""X-Men First Class"" feels more like a sturdy set-up for the next better adventure than a great stand-alone entertainment. Although the effects are big and polished the film isnt quite as good at its human -- and superhuman -- elements particularly when it comes to its supporting mutants. Azazel looks like Hellboy somehow had a kid by Darth Maul. Riptide comes off like a bad bar mitzvah magician. The leads have more luck. A fine James McAvoy radiates all the necessary decency and patience as Xavier; Jennifer Lawrence makes an interesting needy Mystique (although her baby-face renders the characters overt sexuality a little creepy). Murray Close Michael Fassbender portrays Magneto in ""X-Men First Class."" Michael Fassbender falters as a strangely un-magnetic Magneto but Kevin Bacon has a nuclear blast as chief bad guy Sebastian Shaw. With the story set in 1962 director Matthew Vaughns clear inspiration is classic Bond; that makes Bacon the hammy supervillain complete with lushly anachronistic sideburns and the actor has some real fun. More fun sometimes than the audience. Although Vaughn likes campy sets he doesnt have original director Bryan Singers interest in the X-Men as metaphor. Social subtext part of the series going back to the original comic is relegated to some Cold War saber-rattling and replaced with lots of exposition. Admitted the scenes of Xavier assembling his team and putting them through their paces are enjoyable; the last half-hour with the X-folk trying to avert an even-worse Cuban Missile Crisis is terrific. But thats still only about 45 great minutes leaving close to an hour-and-a-half of a painless but fairly mediocre ride. ""X-Men First Class""? More like coach actually.

Photo AP Kevin Bacon and January Jones play a Nazi doctor and villainess Emma Frost who battle the X-Men. (AP) Its 1962 World War III is ready to roll and someone comments incredulously ""Youre sending in a bunch of untried unauthorized freaks."" No not the 1962 Mets -- the ""X-Men First Class"" are here to polish their superheroism stop the Cuban missile crisis and do a lot of ring-a-ding-dinging in cocktail lounges attended by splendid girls in abbreviated lingerie. Between the superpowers there is a lot of Austin Powers. This sure-footed nimbly executed origins story gallops along nicely for more than two fast-paced hours that begin during the Holocaust when at age 12 everyones favorite future Jewish superhero Erik Lehnsherr learns to bend metal as a Nazi doctor cheers him on (and shoots his mother). Erik (who will later take the name Magneto) is played as an adult by that proven Nazi hunter Michael Fassbender of ""Inglourious Basterds"" but Herr Doktor Sebastian Shaw is alas Kevin Bacon. Good actor but more mellow than Mengele. Not the guy Id choose to play a swastikad psycho. As we move to 1962 grown-up Erik vows revenge tracking Shaw to the Nazi bedroom community known as Argentina. Meanwhile in America mind-reader Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) befriends a blue-skinned mutant named Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) then uses his knowledge of mutant DNA exactly the way you or I would To pick up hotties.

There she discovers that a US colonel is being pressured into supporting the placement of missiles in Turkey a move that will cause the Soviets to retaliate with a launching pad in Cuba. Shaw is behind all this and I think Kevin Bacon was in this scene somewhere along with a devil dude who looks like Darth Maul. But in truth I didnt notice much except January Jones in skimpy snow-white underthings as Emma Frost a villainess who can play mind games or even turn (not unsexily) her skin into diamonds. This is a step up from her work on ""Mad Men"" where she merely acted like a block of wood. Shaw who enjoys the ability to suck up power from whatever hes touching -- even a nuclear warhead -- and turn it to his advantage wants to start World War III. Because um after the people are dead all-powerful supermutants like him will be extra especially in charge. Of whatever crumbling cinder is left. Even though humans are already about as much of a threat to this guy as hamsters. Also the whole Turkey-Cuba drama is a bit overthought isnt it? The guy could just march into the White House and take over. Somebody give this guy Gen. Zods phone number. The villain tools around in a nuclear submarine decorated like a cocktail lounge in which he exercises his right to super-sexism. Drinking a whiskey Shaw says ""This needs ice"" to Emma who obligingly pops up to the surface to scrape a couple of cubes off the polar ice cap. Pursuing him at the behest of the CIA which has set up a transmitter gadget inside a giant golf ball that proves the EPCOT center has classified uses Charles Xavier meets Erik and the two launch a nationwide talent search for recruits bringing in characters weve already met plus some new ones. One Havok can do a sort of laser-powered hula hoop he can use like a flame thrower. There is also a lone black guy whose nickname Darwin implies more durability than hes got. For all of this series chatter about civil rights and equal treatment for minorities its casting action isnt very affirmative. Director Matthew Vaughn who did last years delightful ""Kick-Ass"" doesnt do witty this time around (a couple of gags about Charles losing his hair and the line ""X-ceptional"" are about it for humor) but he does keep up a spiffing pace while making the action blaze. A large and talented cast manages to make more than a dozen characters pop but still this is the Michael Fassbender show. He was a wonder as Bobby Sands in ""Hunger"" and showed huge charisma in ""Basterds."" Now hes where Christian Bale was about six years ago a fresh silky menace ready to fill any helmet or fire any weapon youve got. Erik/Magnetos rage at the Nazis his class envy when he spots the Camelot-sized pile in Westchester County where Charles grew up and his (correct) sense that the US military is no friend to the mutants give the show so much juice that theres no need for the heavy political allegory of earlier episodes. Exception when Raven says ""We are different but we shouldnt try to fit into society. Society should be more like us -- mutant and proud."" Excuse me but I think someones been to too many Lady Gaga concerts. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Cosby Show actress Clarice Taylor dead at 93 Read Next Cosby Show actress Clarice Taylor dead at 93 Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46764 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20339 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17970 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Murray Close) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 2 2011 400 AM Title X-Men First Class Prequel exploring the origins of Professor X and Magneto. With James McAvoy Michael Fassbender. Director Matthew Vaughn (212). PG-13 partial nudity sexuality violence. At area theaters. The kind of movie that goes great with extra butter Matthew Vaughns entry in the ""X-Men"" canon is a popcorn flick deluxe. Its big bright savvy and so expansive youll undoubtedly leave feeling you got your moneys worth. Thats a valuable gift in a season thats already brought formulaic follow-ups to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""The Hangover."" Still its hard to ignore the nagging feeling that ""X-Men First Class"" doesnt quite live up to its title. What this fifth installment does however is offer some engaging introductions. While you may already know Professor X and Magneto from the previous films this is our first chance to meet them as Charles and Erik friends who bond over secret powers. Even as a student Charles (James McAvoy) is the voice of reason a telepath who encourages Erik (Michael Fassbender) to use his magnetic strength for good. But as the former victim of a sick Nazi doctor named Shaw (Kevin Bacon) Eric has seen too much pain to share Charles peaceful views. Shaws goal is to push humankind to destruction leaving mutants to rule. So in 1962 he and Emma Frost (a blank January Jones) arrange a nuclear face-off between the Russians and Americans. In response Charles gathers a team of students including those who will eventually become Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) Angel (Zoe Kravitz) and Beast (Nicholas Hoult). Alas while the mutants represent a superior state of existence the movie never evolves to that higher level. Of all the big-screen superhero franchises this one arguably has the most soul the most potential to make grander statements even while blowing stuff up. In contrast to original series director Bryan Singer though Vaughn isnt interested in political subtexts. Hes interested in seeing his actresses in lingerie and his actors surrounded by cool effects. Still while most of the cast makes little impression the wonderful McAvoy is a perfect leader simultaneously calm and charismatic. And a scenery-chewing Bacon provides a wickedly entertaining villain. The preparations for their battle are well-plotted if predictable with the meeting itself suitably explosive. Whats better than guns and grenades? A guy who can turn each on his enemy at will. So even if it never rises to its own challenge this chapter is an entertaining visit with some fascinating characters. And as soon as its over we start wondering when well get to see them again. DONT MISS The recruitment montage in which Charles and Erik go looking for other mutants includes an amusingly unexpected candidate.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The ""X-Men franchise has been the silver standard of the modern multiplex comic book era. Not the ""Dark Knight/""Iron Man/""Incredibles pinnacle but up there with the first few ""Spider-Man movies and arguably more of a class act with its double team of Great British Thespians (Patrick Stewart as the benevolent telepath Professor Charles Xavier Ian McKellan as the eeevil Magneto) and secondary characters that are themselves state-of-the-art special effects. That misunderstood-freaks theme can carry as much allegorical weight as you want to pile on to it too. When a character in the new origins story ""X-Men First Class is outed as a mutant he mumbles with some embarrassment ""You didnt ask I didnt tell.""First Class also extends the alienated-outsider metaphor to African-Americans (Edi Gathegi as the adaptive Darwin) Jews (the young Magneto barely makes it out of the concentration camps) and teenagers (half the cast more or less). Everybody except women but hey its 1962 and you cant take the little ladies seriously unless theyre working as strippers (Zoe Kravitz as the airborne Angel) parading in their blue scaly glory (Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique) or peeling down to their skivvies and projecting themselves into a Russian generals lap. Thats Frost and shes played by January Jones of ""Mad Men. If theyre not selling martinis at the concession stand they probably should.The director is Matthew Vaughn (""Layer Cake ""Kick-Ass) which explains the bad-lad double standard when it comes to the female characters. If you can get past that (and millions of fan-boys wont have much of a problem) ""X-Men First Class is perfectly fine summer folderol epic enough on its own terms if not quite big enough to expand beyond its genre and matter to people who find it difficult to care about characters who spit gobs of flaming phlegm. I realize there are fewer and fewer of us but were a hardy band and stubborn.Far and away the best part of ""First Class is the duo cast to play young Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr wary friends in the days before they became mortal foes. James McAvoy eerily captures the unyielding upper-class goodness that Stewart established in the first three ""X-Men movies surprising given that the actor has specialized in attractively spineless young men up to now. (Parse the ironies as you see fit.) The vaguely terrifying control that Michael Fassbender displayed as Rochester in the recent ""Jane Eyre and as the British officer in ""Inglourious Basterds he brings to bear on Magneto a man so obsessed with vengeance that it has warped him as completely as he can warp steel.These two ground the film in a seriousness of purpose (not to mention posh British accents) especially during the first hour. Where ""First Class loses a little luster is in its choice of supervillain a preening ex-Nazi who wants to kick off World War III. I like Kevin Bacon well enough but weve all seen him in so many movies that hes practically our first cousin by now and he doesnt have the heft to give his scheming the necessary uber-stature. Sadly he comes across as Christoph Waltzs body double. But thats all right since ""First Class tosses mutants at us willy-nilly. In addition to the shape-shifting Mystique (given a nicely adolescent inferiority complex by Lawrence) and Joness diamond-hard Frost they include Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) who might as well be called Yellboy; Havok (Lucas Till) who throws these sort of deadly laser hula hoops at unclad female mannequins; the windy Riptide (Alex Gonzalez); the demonoid Azazel (Jason Flemyng); and Beast (Nicolas Hoult) who starts the movie with mere ape feet and by the end has turned into a giant unconvincing blue Furby.Somewhere in the midst of this is a lone human Moira MacTaggart (Rose Byrne) a CIA field operative whos the first to bring the mutants to the attention of the US government and who has a demurely professional case of the hots for Charles Xavier. Her mutant skill apparently is to strip down to bra and panties to go undercover in an early scene.MacTaggart has been part of the ""X-Men universe since the 1970s and Beast was on the team from the very beginning. Otherwise ""First Class tries to honor the dueling canons of the original Marvel print universe and the recent movie franchise and doesnt sprain its neck too badly. The real world is another matter; the way this movie wraps itself around historical calamities like the Holocaust and the Cuban Missile Crisis (which takes up the entire climax) is disingenuous and occasionally unsettling.But yes yes entertaining enough for a Saturday night and much more satisfying than the last ""X-Men offshoot the woeful ""Wolverine. (Hugh Jackman has an appropriately surly cameo here.) ""First Class handily answers such questions as ""What does a yacht look like when an anchor chain splits it in two horizontally? and ""How many mutants does it take to kill three drunken fugitive Nazis? (one) but it doesnt have the grand sense of reinventing the pop-culture wheel that a movie like ""Star Trek brought to the table in 2009. It merely restarts its franchise. Thats probably all that the fan-boys and the bean-counters wanted in the first place.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. To follow him go to www.twitter.com/tyburr.

It didnt work out too well in ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" so now Marvel Entertainment is attempting a full-system reboot with ""X-Men First Class."" X-Men First Class Fair to good Director Matthew Vaughn. Cast James McAvoy Michael Fassbender Kevin Bacon Jennifer Lawrence. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some sexual content including brief partial nudity and language. This weeks new movie releases Movies based on comic books Superheroes we love Supervillains we love The prequel stars James McAvoy (""Atonement"") as a young Charles Xavier child of privilege mutant telepath and all-around goody-two-shoes though he isnt above using his psychic powers while hitting on the ladies at the local pub. While McAvoy doesnt quite match the Shakespearean gravitas of Patrick Stewart he does display a certain rakish charm not to mention a full head of hair which is good for a few in-jokes aimed at fans of the film franchise. New X-Men explores mutant origins | James McAvoy talks X-Men sex More compelling is his partner-in-bromance Michael Fassbender (""Inglourious Basterds"" ""Jane Eyre"") as the future Magneto Erik Lehnsherr. Bent on taking revenge on the Nazi manipulator who killed his mother hes sort of the Anakin Skywalker to Xaviers Obi-Wan Kenobi. Clocking in at more than two hours ""X-Men First Class"" adopts a rather leisurely pace in bringing their storylines together and explaining how they will end up heading rival bands of mutants one bent on dominating obsolete un-superpowered humanity and the other determined to defend peace justice and etcetera. Happily Marvel has given them an immensely entertaining common enemy in the form of Kevin Bacon. He plays Sebastian Shaw yet another mutant and leader of the Hellfire Club whose plans for humanity involve escalating the Cuban Missile Crisis to the point of kaboom. Its hard to say exactly why Bacon is so much fun in this movie. He certainly doesnt seem to be working that hard at the acting but theres something about his sinister smirk that keeps all eyes on him. As for the rest of the motley crew well fanboys will probably love the mix of familiar and new characters which includes a young Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and a nerdy Banshee (he uses his ultrasonic screech to fly). For the rest of the moviegoing public however it can be a bit tiring to keep up ones willing suspension of disbelief. ""X-Men"" maintains a pretense of science-fictional explanations but its trappings remain adolescent fantasy. Mutants with extraordinary abilities? OK sure but why do they end up looking like demons fairies and werewolves? Even more annoying is the series pretense of offering relevant social commentary from a jokey reference to Dont Ask Dont Tell to its rather disturbing use of the Holocaust narrative (at one point Magneto declares ""Never again"" to justify his contempt for humanity). After all its not the thematic metaphors but the action set-pieces that draw people to a summer blockbuster. In that regard director Matthew Vaughn (""Kick-Ass"") delivers particularly with the climactic air-and-sea battle involving a levitating submarine. ""X-Men First Class"" isnt anywhere close to being a genre classic like ""Spider-Man 2"" or ""The Dark Knight"" but it is good enough to rejuvenate a franchise stuck on idle. Well see how long the treatment lasts. Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Plonk it at a critical juncture of twentieth-century political diplomacy by giving us a Red Dawn-style generic rendering of the Cuban Missile Crisis before suggesting that our boys the X-Men were decisive in defusing this showdown? Its a neat trick already attempted and bungled by Zack Snyder in Watchmen. But while the context of Matthew Vaughns slick X-Men origin story feels like its been filched from the notepad of a GCSE History student theres no shortage of breathtaking spectacle elsewhere. Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is out for the blood of Kevin Bacons pantomime scoundrel Sebastian Shaw the energy-sapping mutant Nazi who executed Eriks mother. Meanwhile in the cosy real-ale pubs of Oxford fledgling genetics professor Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has been roped-in by the CIA to use his telepathic powers to locate Shaw. What follows is a jolly collection of snappy montages FX setpieces a killer fanboy cameo and a torrent of disposable wisecracks that while functioning perfectly as stand-alone episodes fail to cohere.McAvoy plays Xavier as a raffish boffin and his charming performance is one of the films high points. Fassbender too is on teeth-clenching powerhouse mode until his accent dies a death on the home stretch. Jennifer Lawrence is less convincing as shapely shape-shifter Mystique the torch-bearer for the films obligatory investigation into issues of identity and who dubiously adapts the black power slogan into Im a mutant and proud. As with the previous X-Men films the many mutants look like they serve no purpose other than to be pretty punching bags for the films climactic scuffle. You wish as much time was spent on drawing together the disperate elements and devising a ripping yarn than was spent concocting the shiver-inducing final death scene which - props to Vaughn - really is one for the ages.

Plot holes. For X-Men Apocalypse theres no need to worry about plot-holes. Only a whole plot. Because the films ridiculous story stars an ancient egotistical mutant who wishes to rule the world and wreck everything. Kinda like Donald Trump.Its ridiculousness as a story arc can really only exist in a superhero franchise. So I didnt give up on the film based on plot alone. As thankfully X-Men Apocalypse delivers brilliant special effects cracks some awesome moments (Quicksilvers scenes cement him as a top lad) and playful dialogue.Essentially its another Bryan Singer directed X-Men film albeit not as good as the Patrick Stewart classics.

I`m sure I missed out on a few references (take a look at how one or two reviewers enjoyed the Wolverine cameo for instance) but the movie stands as an entertaining well-produced spectacle in its own right. McAvoy is very charming and I dare say both Fassbender and January Jones will set a few hearts a-flutter too.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 7 2011LouFeaturedI left the cinema quite disappointed it was all about the effects but generally that doesnt make me go to the cinemas I was looking for a well told story with coherence and depth on my favourite superheros but the movie just falls short in both; someone earlier commented on the McAvoy-Fassbender portrayal of Prof X-Magneto vs Stewart-McKellen and theres no way you can even compare I prefer the old guard plus the fact that McAvoy had to touch his forehead when using his power was a bit annoying. The final battle was awesome but thats about it the movie in general left me wanting more had I seen it on tv I probably wouldve liked it more... PS Wolverine and Mystique cameos were brilliantHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 6 2011_Matt_77_FeaturedOverall this is a really good film which packs a punch with its awesome special effects (full of cool surprises) its dramatic fight scenes and the characters developing personalities personal dilemmas split loyalties and in one or two cases personal tragedies. The story it tells presumably lifted more or less wholesale from the comics (I wouldnt know) as you would expect neatly explains the characters you see in the later instalments and the tensions and strange bonds between them (especially Xavier and Magneto) Im giving it four stars because I feel some of the character development was a little lacking in depth or gravitas (in a film which is clearly trying to tackle those kinds of areas seriously) and because I have one or two pedantic niggles with the film which annoy me ... So what were my petty niggles? If I were setting out to pick faults I would mention Magnetos accent somehow going kind of Irish towards the end of the film which is a bit odd considering hes a German Jew; also the way he looks like hes been Photoshopped when he climbs down onto the aircraft fusilage in the big sea scene; also Shaws funny accent at the start of the film but to be fair its the accent hes using when hes speaking German so the non-German-speakers in the audience wont care and Im not a native speaker so maybe Ive got it wrong and his accent might be excellent but there was something about it I didnt like. On a more substantive level I felt there wasnt really enough put into fleshing out Shaws background or his involvement with the Nazis and I wasnt totally convinced by the personality development for Mystique or the fluttery-winged fairy girl. ... +1 to andrews comment though- Wolverine brings the awesomeHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 6 2011HenryFeaturedThe best thing for me concerning this movie was the whole cast.

As the reviewer points out Fassbenders accent drop was really jarring and the film is definitely 15-20 mins too long. In spite of some good styling work by the set and costume guys I was never able to buy into the early 60s setting.

After undergoing some unfortunate mutations in recent years a beleaguered Marvel movie property gets the smart stylish prequel it deserves in ""X-Men First Class."" Reclaiming much of the pop-operatic grandeur and insouciant wit so evident in the series first two installments director/co-writer Matthew Vaughn imagines the rise of Professor X Magneto and their earliest mutant disciples as a 60s-set origin story steeped in Cold War paranoia and served up with a delightful Rat Pack swagger. Strong word of mouth franchise popularity and the publics seemingly inexhaustible appetite for comicbook fare should keep ""First Class"" at a high B.O. altitude worldwide. The series spluttering 2009 foray into how-it-all-began territory with ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" may have tempered audience anticipation for ""First Class"" and Vaughn handily exceeds expectations with a picture that may rile Stan Lee purists but should prove entirely engaging for franchise newcomers as well as viewers familiar with the series mythology. Both constituencies however may be surprised by the degree to which Vaughn manages to invest this unabashedly commercial product with a unique stylistic identity. Providing a major assist in this regard is Bryan Singer who hasnt been involved with the series since he so assuredly directed the first two installments and who returns here as a producer and story writer (with Sheldon Turner). Singers touch is apparent in the films very first shot which expands on the Auschwitz-set prologue of 2000s ""X-Men"" extending the fascination with Nazi iconography Singer evinced in ""Valkyrie"" and ""Apt Pupil."" When he learns that young camp refugee Erik Lensherr (Bill Milner) has the power to bend metal with his mind Mengele-like Dr. Schmidt (Kevin Bacon) attempts to harness the boys abilities in horrifying fashion. The tragic outcome of this unpleasant rather ill-advised episode instills in Erik a lifelong thirst for revenge and renders him incapable of summoning his gifts without channeling his rage. In contrast to the bitter brooding Erik (played as an adult by Michael Fassbender) dashing Oxford academic Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) envisions a utopian world order in which mutants are able to control their superhuman gifts and coexist with the rest of mankind. Possessing astonishing telepathic abilities and for now the full use of his legs Charles is delightfully presented as a ladies man who turns scientific observations into pick-up lines to the loving exasperation of his adoptive sister Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) a shape-shifter who struggles to keep her natural blue-skinned appearance under wraps. Suspecting malevolent outside interference in the escalating U.S.-Soviet conflict plucky pretty CIA agent Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) recruits Charles despite the agencys hostility toward these strange new beings called mutants. This uneasy alliance ushers in the storys most dramatic development in an emotionally surging scene that brings the future Professor X and Magneto together for the first time. Though the ideological differences between Charles optimistic empathy and Eriks cynical superiority couldnt be more pronounced the mens mutual respect leads to friendship and they band together to build a stronghold of young mutants. At this point ""First Class"" almost comes to resemble a 1960s heist picture by way of a James Bond caper as Charles and Erik assemble their motley crew hitting up strip clubs pubs prisons and other unlikely joints in sequences that thrum with period atmosphere. In setting the classic ""X-Men"" parable of intolerance and suspicion within a context overshadowed by nuclear paranoia and the Cuban Missile Crisis (which undergoes a major historical rewrite) Vaughn takes full advantage of the milieus expressive opportunities. Lenser John Mathieson reinforces the films retro orientation with canted camera angles and tracking shots that show off the richness of Chris Seagers production design whether its a louche Las Vegas nightclub or a submarine commandeered by Bacons renascent villain now calling himself Sebastian Shaw. Having taken the superhero subgenre to smart-alecky extremes in ""Kick-Ass"" Vaughn shows how much more hes capable of when he plays this sort of material straight. Helmer tosses off the recruitment and training sequences with panache especially an extended montage detailing the rearing of such future X-Men as the plasma-blasting Havok (Lucas Till); sonic screamer Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones); the endlessly adaptive Darwin (Edi Gathegi too little seen); and bookish big-footed Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult). Its a captivating sequence that honors one of the consistent thrills of the superhero origin story the combination of ingenuity and instinct by which an individual unlocks his or her extraordinary potential. The coming-out metaphor implicit in ""X-Mens"" mutants-among-us premise is made overt here in dialogue that often hits its points too emphatically (""You didnt ask so I didnt tell"" Hank mumbles when queried about his background). The films prosaic bluntness is matched by a sometimes forced quality to the characters emotional and philosophical progressions; certain tough decisions facing Erik and Raven in particular feel more expedient than inevitable. Still its remarkable how many things ""First Class"" gets right whether its the decision to have characters speak different languages as the films frequent globe-trotting dictates or the casting of Fassbender and McAvoy who bear no resemblance to their respective older counterparts (Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart) but perfectly capture Charles and Eriks symbolic might-vs.-right dynamic. While their brief physiological transformations limit their expressiveness Hoult and Lawrence register poignantly as two young individuals trying to figure out their unique place in a hostile world while ""Mad Mens"" January Jones makes her blank affect work to her advantage in the role of Shaws cold-blooded deputy Emma Frost. Two veteran ""X-Men"" thesps also make brief amusing cameos. Despite a somewhat hefty 130-minute running time ""First Class"" feels swift sleek and remarkably coherent; an even longer more fully fleshed-out version would not have been unwelcome. Visual effects designed by John Dykstra are smoothly and imaginatively integrated and Henry Jackmans score provides fantastic forward momentum.

TWITTER A first-class production that excitingly reenergizes a flagging franchise. Much as Casino Royale rebooted the James Bond franchise in a fresh and dynamic way X-Men First Class injects new blood into a franchise that for all its profitability had become blandly anemic. In fact roughly the first half of this massive and very well cast origins extravaganza is arguably the best hour of Marvel Comics-derived filmmaking among the torrent of it thats cascaded across screens in recent years. Audacious confident and fueled by youthful energy this is a surefire summer winner for a wide global audience. The spectre of Bond actually hovers over this British-flavored production in a number of ways all of them beneficial The 1962 setting shot through with Cold War tensions conjures up the political moment at which 007 was born cinematically the hardware and style harken back to an earlier high-tech era that looks quaintly beguiling today and Michael Fassbender as Erik the future Magneto cuts a dashingly ruthless figure that can only have been patterned on Sean Connery in the early Bonds. First Class is comprised of an enormous stew of elements and influences but head chef Matthew Vaughn has stirred things so as to make them not only digestible but quite tasty. Departing from the backstory of the comics the new yarn devised by Sheldon Turner and original X-Men director Bryan Singer and written by Thor co-scenarists Ashley Edward Miller and Zack Stentz along with Jane Goldman and Vaughn pivots on an alluringly fanciful proposition that the real events of the Cuban missile crisis had a shadow history involving manipulations by figures whose super powers put those of the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to shame; its as if JFK Khrushchev Castro the CIA and the combined armed forces of the East and West were mere puppets doing the bidding of unsuspected Olympian gods the most spiteful of whom desire nothing less than human extermination. Not inaptly then it all begins (as did Singers original 2000 X-Men) at Auschwitz where young Erik challenged to display his ""magnetic"" powers sees his mother gunned down by the heinous camp doctor (Kevin Bacon) an event that dictates all his actions from then on. In the more benign setting of Westchester New York two kids Charles and Raven exhibit odd characteristics of their own that nearly two decades later will put them in the forefront of the mutant movement. Like the most peripatetic of 1960s globe-hopping thrillers the early stretch of First Class hardly stays put for more than a moment jumping all over the world--Geneva Oxford Las Vegas Argentina Miami Washington D.C.--in the service of introducing an enormous number of characters and delineating their unique powers. Under the circumstances director Vaughn impressively maintains a strong focus dedicated to clarity and dramatic power; while Erik scours the world for stray Nazis (his confrontation with two of them in a tavern on the pampas is an early highlight) Charles (James McAvoy) achieves academic prominence and with Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) is recruited by the CIA with the eventual aim of assembling a ""Division of Mutant Powers."" Even though a lot of the early material is set-up it nevertheless develops surprising momentum and tension. The malevolent doctor Erik remembers from the concentration camp now resurfaces as Sebastian Shaw who has developed an extraordinary capacity to absorb harness and deploy energy while his fabulously sexy partner in crime Emma Frost (January Jones) not only has extreme telepathic ability but possesses an optional indestructible diamond veneer. When Erik tracks them down on board their yacht and seems on the verge of fulfilling his vengeful 18-year quest his quarry escape in a manner befitting the best of the Bonds. Once the loner Erik decides to join forces with Charles under the auspices of an offbeat CIA honcho (Oliver Platt) and an adventurous agent (Rose Byrne) the film takes on more the air of a standard-issue Marvel effort as mutant youngsters are trained in hiding to master their unusual powers; they are Hank/Beast (Nicholas Hoult) Alex/Havoc (Lucas Till) Sean/Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones) Armondo/Darwin (Edi Gathegi) and for a while Angel (Zoe Kravitz). The problem here is not only familiarity but that unlike the other characters these kids seem resolutely 21st century not early 1960s; one of them even says ""whatever."" Another drawback a likely victim of an overcrowded roster of characters is that two swarthy henchmen of Shaws are not even given the benefit of an introduction much less anything to play. Still once Emma Frost penetrates the inner sanctum of the Soviet military and the enormity of Shaws scheme becomes clear the film takes off again with a fantastical rendition of an American/Soviet naval confrontation off Cuba trumped by the manipulative antics of battling telepathic mutants on board an ultra-futuristic plane and a stealth submarine. Vaughn orchestrates the mayhem with a laudable coherence a task made easier by a charging churning score by Henry Jackman that much as that of his mentor Hans Zimmer did in Inception helps smooth the connections among rapidly changing locations and events. A few of the effects in the climactic section dont quite measure up but the visual effects by veteran wizard John Dykstra are mostly terrific. Top-drawer contributions are also delivered by production designer Chris Seagers costume designer Sammy Sheldon and cinematographer John Mathieson. The cast is almost absurdly easy on the eyes and is most powerful at the top thanks to the intense Fassbender who will now need no audition if Daniel Craig decides to give up Bond after another picture or two. McAvoy is forced to spend a bit too much time with his hand to head summoning telepathic signals but nonetheless conveys the intelligence and sobriety required for the future Professor X. Bacon is formidable as the former Nazi who aspires to far greater power than Hitler could ever dream of while Jones dazzlingly projects the arrogance of maximum beauty and invulnerability. As the naturally blue-skinned red-haired and yellow-eyed Raven/Mystique Lawrence is at her most appealing when conveying an ashamed insecurity about her natural looks which she can conceal with a human facade. A vulgar cameo by a certain hirsute character provides a hearty laugh.
