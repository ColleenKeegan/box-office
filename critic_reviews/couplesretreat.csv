Starring Vince Vaughn Jon Favreau Jason Bateman Kristen Bell Malin Akerman Kristin Davis Faizon Love Jean Reno Director Peter Billingsley Running time 154 Release Opened Oct 9 2009  Editorial Review Get an Early Checkout At Couples RetreatBy Dan ZakWashington Post Staff WriterFriday October 9 2009The characters in the utterly unimaginative ""Couples Retreat"" live in a world of marital cliches. The guys including Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau bond over beer in the living room while their wives sit in the kitchen with glasses of chardonnay. Theyre all worried about keeping the spark alive after years of togetherness. So they escape to Eden Resort an all-inclusive tropical getaway designed to revitalize run-down marriages.As the turquoise water laps in the background they do couples therapy and couples yoga. The latter allows a beefy instructor to put the wives in compromising positions thereby challenging the husbands masculinity. This scene goes for safe easy sexist laughs. As does the rest of the movie.Vaughn under duress is one of Hollywoods great shticks but in this movie hes on autopilot as a good father with no hangups and a deferential wife (Malin Akerman). Favreau plays the typical Vaughn part instead going off on verbal sprees at the slightest provocation by his wife played by the pert passable Kristin Davis. Rounding out the troupe are Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell as the uptight couple and Faizon Love and Kali Hawk as the black couple (which is all the movie allows them to be).Watching these affable actors ham it up in French Polynesia seems like the perfect brain vacation but ""Couples Retreat"" coasts on comic fumes relying on colloquialisms foreign accents racial stereotypes lemon sharks Speedos and inopportune erections to supply the funny. Any one of these things might work in a comedy that was less contrived.The movie requires the four couples to behave unnaturally in order to stoke conflict. People in the real world dont proclaim the death of their marriage and then fully reconcile in the span of 20 seconds as they do here. Why couldnt ""Couples Retreat"" have been lighthearted and zany throughout instead of trying to push across a message about picket-fence monogamy?Its a scam. Its an excuse for Vaughn and company to kick back in Bora Bora cobble together subpar entertainment and rake in the dough because weve been conditioned to expect a good time from them. If you want a good comedy about rocky relationships thats set in a tropical resort and co-stars Kristen Bell rent ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall.""Couples Retreat (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content language crude humor and some drug references.

They co-wrote and co-star in this plot-heavy affair which brings four couples to the sun-splashed surroundings of Eden East then puts them through a compulsory programme of marriage-guidance therapy before they can get on the jet-skis. The pretext is enabling old pal Jason Bateman to procreate with partner Kristen Bell but circumstances expose the flaws in both Vaughn and Favreaus own relationships. So expectations of farce are stymied by long stretches of mid-life navel gazing notwithstanding Favreaus willingness to humiliate himself as the lecherously frustrated hubby in the party. Meanwhile the director is unable to impose rhythm or focus on the escalating complications and allows scene-stealing yoga teacher Carlos Ponces amusing shtick to go on far too long. Somehow though Vaughns cheeky appeal remains intact but he needs better material. They all do.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 08 2009 500PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Couples Retreat Directed by Peter Billingsley Written by Vince Vaughn Jon Favreau Dana Fox Starring Vince Vaughn Jon Favreau Kristin Davis Malin Akerman Classification PG Heres the title Couples Retreat. And heres the review Couples Retreat. Yep just find the verb treat it as a command and vamoose unless you harbour an abiding curiosity about how eternally long 100 minutes can feel. Let me explain and be assured Ill keep it brief. First some quick background. Have you noticed that Hollywood romantic comedies and horny college kids share the same fondness for beachfront vacations and for much the same reason? In both cases whenever the amorous script runs dry theres always a fall-back plan - just ogle all the exposed skin the babes in bikinis and/or hunks in Speedos. The Heartbreak Kid recently took advantage of this holiday plan as did ForgettingSarah Marshall . Each had arid patches but nothing compared to the vast expanses here. So dont be fooled by its South Pacific setting - this is the Sahara of scripts. Liam Lacey on Couples Retreat Watch Globe film critic Liam Laceys 60-second video reviews. Even the preamble is windy. Most failed comedies at least get the set-up right but these establishing frames dont ""establish""; instead they huff and puff before finally getting around to revealing what anyone whos peeked at the trailer already knows. Four couples. The one couple having domestic woes convince the other three to accompany them on a trip to ""Eden"" for a week of sun fun and marital therapy. I wont lie to you There is sun and there is therapy. There are also scenes the disjointed kind that wander off aimlessly in the vague hope of finding a movie not to mention a laugh. No need to bore you with the swimming-with-sharks howler or the dry-humping-with-the-yoga-instructor delight. No need because once again the trailer has done my work for me and with refreshing commercial candour - the promised lameness is truly delivered. Nor must we dwell on the his-and-hers massage sequence where the search for comedy sees a sexually frustrated guy seeking relief in shiatsu. Something comes up under that sheet but it aint comedy. I do however wish to dwell a little on the strip-down-to-your-undies scene if only because it speaks volumes about the starkly different - some might say hypocritically different - aesthetic demands placed on the male and female principals in this flick. The actresses are Kristin Davis Malin Akerman Kristin Bell and Kali Hawk. Each is fit attractive and looks mighty fetching in her undies or a bikini or the teensy frocks preferred by romantic comedies on vacation. Now consider the men Jason Bateman Vince Vaughn Jon Favreau and Faizon Love. Each is past his physical prime and with the possible exception of Bateman palpably unfit; in fact stripped down to their undies they look like escalating balls of rotundity. If ""fatty"" were a Latin noun these guys could be its declension. Does their appearance matter? Clearly appearance matters on the other side of the gender fence. So cmon boys play fair When the humour goes missing in action and all thats left is exposed skin at least give the poor audience some equal-opportunity ogling time. Speaking of boys when they were a younger and slimmer couple Vaughn and Favreau collaborated to make Swingers  an amusing if minor film at the time but a comic masterpiece when measured by this shrunken yardstick. Seems theyve done some retreating of their own. Admittedly the ending here contains a valuable nugget delivered by a happy camper somewhere east of Eden who pronounces ""We should try to have fun."" If so we should try harder to avoid not having fun. Remember that title and heed its command.

Theres a good reason. This is less a romantic comedy than a timely maintenance comedy. Vince Vaughn Jason Bateman and Jon Favreau head a cast of faulty pairs who wind up at a resort for couples. Their counterparts are played by Malin Akerman Kristen Bell and Kristin Davis respectively. Also along for the misadventure recently divorced friend Shane (Faizon Love) and his too-young paramour. Over the last few years Vaughn (a producer on this romp) has taken on the relationship comedy as a star a producer and theorist of contemporary love. ""The Break-Up"" with Jennifer Aniston was the most ambitious. Taking the contempt a couple might begin to feel for each other to heart it turned out to be a very dark comedy. And last years ""Four Christmases"" was the meanest with its unfunny class riffs. ""Couples Retreat"" which Vaughn co-wrote with Favreau and Dana Fox (""What Happens in Vegas"") may not be overly ambitious. It isnt nearly as pretty as the island the couples visit. Shot in Bora Bora the sea is an uncanny azure the sands pristine. The villas assigned to the couples are the stuff of the Conde Nast Travelers ""Room With View"" feature. But the film makes up for that with a fine dose of (occasionally bitter) sweetness and a buoyant raft of witty lines. The joke is on the three couples who agreed to take the trip in support of their tightly wound friends Jason (a typically agile Bateman) and Cynthia. They believed the ""couples skill building"" courses were optional. Theyre not. All of them must participate Joey and Lucy who are just waiting for their teen daughter to go to college to call it quits; frisky and foolish Shane and Trudy; and Dave and Ronnie a couple able to maintain a decent batting average making contact with lifes curveballs more often than not. In a bit of delicious counter- casting Jean Reno is couples guru Marcel. The writers maintain a good balance between making fun of the couples discomfort with therapy and teasing the silliness of the resort and its staff. ""Couples Retreat"" seems primed to make sport of couples counseling. Kudos to the actors playing the therapists. Two youll recognize John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeong. And while it has its fun with the discomfort that comes of talking things through the comedy takes the work of relationship surprisingly seriously. That admitted fear not. There are plenty of dippy riffs. The couples don Chinese-style uniforms for their counseling sessions. A trust exercise with fish goes amusingly awry. The ripped yoga master (Carlo Ponce) has a sculpted bod and the tatty locks of Fabio. ""The Wizard of Oz"" gets a nod. And in a script that swings from high to low and back again Harriet Tubman gets a shout-out too. The video game Guitar Hero gets a full-on shredding close-up. There are bawdy moments that barely skirted an R. (Its a nervy PG-13 after an appeal.) And the ethnic shtick is occasionally too broad but hardly cruel. Newcomer Kali Hawk is too loud by a few decibels as Trudy. But husky Shane is likable even as he confuses an extended booty call for a heart- mending romance. The director is Peter Billingsley -- Ralphie in the holiday classic ""A Christmas Story."" A producer making his directorial debut he does an able job of keeping things moving. He even winks at his own child stardom by gently mining an impossibly cute turn by Colin Baiocchi as Dave and Ronnies youngest. What the unfettered will take away from ""Couples Retreat"" is anybodys guess. Maybe theyll consider it a funny ""but for the grace of God"" cautionary tale. For couples it may be the oddest of hybrids a too-close- to-home yet goofball date movie. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com.

John Johnson/Universal Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? If the Bora Bora travel commission was hoping to get a boost from ""Couples Retreat"" a rude awakening awaits. Photographed (blearily) against French Polynesian picture-postcard backdrops this deeply unfunny film is further proof that movie comedy these days - in its acting writing directing - is far below the average sitcom. But even by current dismal movie comedy standards the awfulness of ""Couples Retreat"" is a standout. Four troubled couples played by among others Vince Vaughn and Malin Akerman Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell and Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis converge on an island resort for some fun-in-the-sun marital counseling. Im sure that everybody involved in the making of ""Couples Retreat"" had a marvelous vacation. Its the audience for this film that will require therapy.

Thirteen years after the smart ""Swingers"" actor-writers Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau have stranded themselves on a laughless island in ""Couples Retreat"" a schmaltzy smutty and mean-spirited quasi-satire set in a touchy-feely New Age resort. Hope they and the rest of the cast had a good time in Bora Bora. Anybody who actually spends 12 to see this sure wont. How unfunny is ""Couples Retreat""? The inept directing debut from Peter Billingsley (the former child star of ""A Christmas Story"") scores its biggest laughs with a 4-year-old relieving himself in a hardware store display. Twice. If that doesnt scare you away this movies broad concept of romance embraces Favreau pleasuring himself in two different scenes. Your 12 bucks also buys three sequences built around barely disguised commercials for ""Guitar Hero"" and Applebees. All strung on a plot skimpier than Kristen Bells bikini. Jason Bateman reeks of desperation as a control freak who for no good reason breaks into pal Vaughns house in the middle of the night. Bateman begs dad-of-two Vaughn and Vaughns wife (Malin Akerman) to join Bateman and his wife (Bell) who are having trouble conceiving a child for a relationship-healing retreat in the South Pacific. God knows why he would make this request let alone why Vaughn and two other couples would comply. Favreau is a horndog improbably married to Kristin Davis who also has a wandering eye. Their party is completed by even more tiresome stereotypes the fat black divorced guy (Faizon Love) and his new sassy and much younger girlfriend (Tasha Smith). It gets worse as Vaughn Favreau and credited co-conspirator Dana Fox bring on a ""couples whisperer"" played by a spectacularly unfunny Jean Reno; wacky therapists including Ken Jeong of ""The Hangover""; a fascist majordomo with a fake-British accent (Peter Serafinowicz); and a hunky yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce) wielding an enormous bulge in his too-tight trunks. Each is less funny than the last. I could go on but suffice to say this movie practically bludgeons you with its sub-Apatovian gags including a shark attack and multiple references to testicular cancer. Like most of Universals offerings this year you have to wonder exactly who (besides masochists) they thought would actually want to see ""Couples Retreat"" in a theater. Small wonder the studio fired its production chiefs this week. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Jane but not plain Read Next Jane but not plain Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16059 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Couples Retreat A little less conversation | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionCouples Retreat A little less conversationIf you feel like youve already seen Couples Retreat  it could be trailer overload. Universal has pushed this South Pacific romantic comedy for so long and so hard regular moviegoers would by now have every laugh line memorized.From left Jon Favreau Malin Akerman Vince Vaughn Faizon Love and Kristin Davis try to mend their relationships in paradise.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 9 2009 Couples Retreat2.5 stars (out of 4)Starring Jason Bateman Malin Akerman Vince Vaughn Kristin Davis Jon Favreau Kristen Bell Faison Love and Jean Reno. 113 minutes. Directed by Peter Billingsley. At major theatres. PG If you feel like youve already seen Couples Retreat it could be trailer overload. Universal has pushed this South Pacific romantic comedy for so long and so hard regular moviegoers would by now have every laugh line memorized.But heres the really funny thing about this picture its not your typical formula rom-com. Beneath the ham acting and the relentless banter is a serious movie about relationships. Were being sold laughs but a few sober thoughts are delivered.Its the first feature directed by the actor Peter Billingsley who is best known as four-eyed Ralphie from A Christmas Story. Hes opted to get out of the way of an unwieldy cast of fast-talkers who are led by Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau (the Swingers duo reunited again) and Jason Bateman. Their screen spouses almost as fast with the banter are Malin Akerman Kristin Davis and Kristen Bell. Faizon Love and sparkling newcomer Kali Hawk play the wild cards a couple in lust rather than love.Theyre all brought together to a Bora Bora enclave called the Eden Resort. Their avowed mission is to save the imploding marriage of Jason (Bateman) and Cynthia (Bell) two fusspots who have Power Pointed the moment where romance collided with reality theyve been unable to conceive a child and now dont even feel like trying. The other couples are almost as fragile. Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Akerman) have young kids busy jobs and neglected libidos.Joey (Favreau) and Lucy (Davis) are literally counting the days until their daughter leaves for college and they can also head out the door perhaps not together.Shane (Love) is separated from his wife and trying hard to impress 20-year-old Trudy (Hawk) who calls him ""Daddy"" because he gives her lots of sugar.The usual cabal of rom-com quirksters meet them upon their arrival. The cleverly cast Jean Reno is Marcel a ""couples whisperer"" who demands 6 a.m. underwear strip downs and yoga sessions to restore connubial connections.Muscular Salvadore (Latin pop star Carlos Ponce) wants to work every muscle especially the ones in the pelvis. And Stanley (Peter Serafinowicz) is the obligatory tight-ass in charge of enforcing the resorts strict New Age policies.The screenplay by Vaughn Favreau and Dana Fox (What Happens In Vegas) is unbelievably verbose almost as if the three were being paid by the word.Theyre deaf to the maxim about brevity being the soul of wit preferring to stretch every scene way past the funny mark - which also results in a movie that groans towards the two-hour mark. (If all else fails just drink in the incredible scenery.)Vaughn who also produced has done himself no favours Why has he allowed himself to become the guy who spitballs out mouthfuls of dialogue? He has a gift for physical comedy as he demonstrates in a scene involving the Guitar Hero game (just one of many shameless product plugs in the film). Yet he prefers to talk talk talk.Still all the yakking actually yields a few interesting thoughts. Such as that maybe relationships are worth working on and saving. The scenes where the couples meet with relationship therapists (two of them played by rom-com regulars John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeong) actually look like they could be real working sessions for the most part. The advice given to the couples actually makes sense if you strip away the jargon.Strangest thing of all about this peculiar movie is that you can imagine all of these couples even ""bang-bangers"" Shane and Trudy as being together in real life. That aint particularly funny but its a nice change from the norm.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

INTERVIEW Vince Vaughn Peter Billingsley The tall and short of Retreat TRAILER Get an advance look at Retreat The love part is murkier but several actors involved are often forced to make asses of themselves. To little avail. Its still not funny. Despite the exotic locale the film is drab and plodding. The premise while hackneyed has possibilities A couple whose marriage is in trouble (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) persuade their pals to accompany them on a scenic beach getaway selling the water sports and spa-induced tranquility of the vacation package. But when they arrive its all about couples therapy and shrink-rapping. Vince Vaughn and Malin Akerman appear to be the most solid of the couples. Parents of two young boys they live an unremarkable suburban existence. On less sturdy ground are Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis high school sweethearts whove lost that lovin feeling. Rounding out the group is the portly Faizon Love newly divorced and hooked up with a fun-loving 20-year-old (Kali Hawk). When they arrive at the idyllic island their spirits are high. Hopes are dashed however when the group is ordered about by an officious twit (Peter Serafinowicz) who limits their activities and even their food and drink intake. Soon they are forced to submit to the New Age psycho-babble and weird scenarios of a bespectacled guru (a miscast Jean Reno). Scenes involving a strapping yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce) offer some obvious humor. His Latin-lover dialogue and physicality are initially funny but one-note. Much is made of the wandering eyes of Favreau and Davis in a prolonged and laugh-free couples massage scene. The usually funny John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeong play double-talking therapists. The few laughs to be had are primarily courtesy of Vaughn who shows flashes of his Wedding Crashers hilarity. Its too bad CouplesRetreat is so poorly written and conceived given the talented cast and chemistry between Vaughn and pal Favreau. Were meant to relate to these hapless folks or laugh at their foibles but more often we wince. A bathroom joke involving a toddler is played twice presumably to force us into submissive guffaws. Perhaps the infantile replay was tacked on to keep us from going into a sugar coma after the trips unbelievable syrupy-sweet conclusion.

Not great but not terrible. But this movie which plays out like the fulfillment of the Swingers dudes worst nightmares is just sad. (See TIMEs fall entertainment preview.) Its about four couples who go to Eden a luxury tropical resort that features couples counseling along with its crystalline waters and multiple hot tubs. Vaughn plays the leader of the glum-married pack Dave a producer of video games (including Guitar Hero) who lives with his chirpy wife Ronnie (Malin Akerman) and kids in a snowy suburb. Favreau is Joey a former high school-football star who got cheerleader Lucy (Kristin Davis) pregnant on prom night did the ""right"" thing and has been growing toxically bitter ever since. Neither man wants therapy and their spouses dont either -- Joey and Lucy are secretly planning a divorce -- but their fertility-challenged type-A friends Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) are desperate for it though they can afford Eden only at a group rate. So off everyone goes to Bora Bora with the expectation that the feelings talk is optional. Instead they are forced into having their relationships analyzed by the resident guru Monsieur Marcel (Jean Reno) and a team of therapists that includes John Michael Higgins (a brief bright spot) and Ken Jeong who gets a laugh just by being recognizably that guy from The Hangover a blessing and a curse. Couples Retreat was co-written by Vaughn and Favreau with an assist from Dana Fox and it has the choppiness youd expect from too many cooks in the kitchen (in contrast Favreau was the only screenwriter on Swingers). Im fine with the original Trent (""money"") and Mike (not ""money"" no matter what Trent said) moving to the suburbs having kids getting fat and spending weekends at Home Depot and Applebees. These things happen. Whats depressing is that theres hardly a creative spark in this sour offensive contrived story and its sloppiness is more consistent than its comedy. Consider the illogic with which the screenplay shoehorns a token African-American couple -- their buddy Shane (Faizon Love) and his new girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk) -- into the cast. Shane a recently divorced man with the belly of a woman fast approaching her fourth trimester is introduced begging Dave to co-sign a loan for a hot motorcycle that is intended to impress Trudy who is 20 has pink streaks in her hair and calls Shane ""Daddy."" (The old joke is that in horror movies the African-American characters always get killed first. Here they are saddled with such unpleasant stereotyping that being taken out in the first act would seem like a favor.) Dave grudgingly agrees to the loan because hes a mensch but reminds Shane of all the financial trouble hes in. Does anyone bring up those finances when it comes to the bill for Eden? No because they need Shane and Trudy for comic relief and to make the movie seem less like a portrait of whining white upper-middle-class people. Only to a point though -- looking at a poster for the movie you have to squint to find Love and Hawk. Theyre way in the back. The married women fare no better than the minorities. These are retro sitcom-style wives bland and humorless. Ronnie frets about kitchen tiles. Lucy lusts after the Fabio-type yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce ripping off Hank Azarias shtick). Cynthia lives to please her controlling husband. At least two of them seem to have shackles to throw off but in the movie the only things they free themselves from are their clothes so we can see how they each measure up to those most demanding of standards of director Peter Billingsley the ability to rock a bra and panties. There has always been an edge to the pairing of Favreau and Vaughn but its usually Vaughn who plays the fast-talking loathsome one. In Made he played a character so astoundingly annoying it bordered on performance art but he got away with it on the strength of his natural charm and youthful beauty. Here hes been neutered and Favreau takes on the role instead. Its not that Favreau isnt believable as Joey a horny guy who is angry at the hand life has dealt him. Its that hes too believable. He arrives at Eden with the sole goal of looking for a fresh piece of womanhood then discovers that its obtainable only at Eden East the nearby (and off-limits) singles resort. In various sequences we have the privilege of seeing Joey leer at girls nearly as young as his daughter set himself up for some solo sex on the couch (across America women will turn away from their moisturizer shuddering at the memory) and all but demand some extended bodywork from a hapless masseuse. Its gruesome. Undeniably Favreau brings conviction to the part but he wrote himself into a hole. Our idea of a happy ending might entail Joey being devoured by sharks somewhere east of Eden. Instead we get marital resolutions based on the fear that nothing is worse than being alone at Applebees on a Friday night. Lucy may beg to differ by the time Couples Retreat Return to Eden opens.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures John Johnson) In this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Carlos Ponce left Vince Vaughn center and Malin Akerman are shown in a scene from ""Couples Retreat."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures John Johnson) Photo John Johnson AP Review Couples Retreat cant cut it 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Couples Retreat Comedy. Starring Vince Vaughn Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis. (PG-13. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If I were a marriage counselor and if I ran an exotic resort for couples looking to solidify their relationship I wouldnt hire a half-naked yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce) to perform tantric humping maneuvers on discontented wives. At least not while their husbands are watching. Then again thats one of the funnier bits in ""Couples Retreat"" a marriage-renewal comedy with a decent cast a few good ideas and no clear grasp on what to do with them. On paper the notion of eight friends - four miserable couples - trapped in paradise with a bunch of control-freak therapists holds some promise. Two of the friends are Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau domesticated into frumpy suburban husbands. Malin Akerman plays Vaughns wife Kristin Davis plays Favreaus. The remaining two couples are Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell as anal compulsives on the brink of splitting up and Faizon Love and Kali Hawk as a divorced buddy and his amusingly vacant 20-year-old girlfriend. The anal couple have convinced the others to spend a week at Eden Resorts a getaway that promises Jet Skis and snorkeling alongside therapeutic counseling. But when they get there they meet a supercilious Brit (Peter Serafinowicz) in a blue safari jacket who lays out the rules. It seems the counseling starts at 6 a.m. attendance required. All of this might add up to an amusing romp but director Peter Billingsley runs out of gas in every scene. Gags start out well enough and then deflate leaking air with an almost audible hiss. The whole thing is fuddled with schmaltz; its the sort of movie that brings in the maudlin clarinet just as a troubled husband bemoans the loss of that lovin feeling. The pacing the acting the editing - its all slapdash a clumsy excuse for unfunny erection jokes and breathtaking Polynesian vistas. Too bad the movie is spoiling the view.

"Couples Retreat | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; couples-retreat ) Couples Retreat (United States 2009) October 08 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli At the very least its necessary to respect what the filmmakers try to do with Couples Retreat even if the end result isnt fully successful or satisfying. Their goal is to take the basic template for a raunchy sex comedy and change it up by inserting some dramatic elements and attempting to shape the lead caricatures to the point where they almost reach a legitimate ""character"" state. There are two problems. The drama while a cut above that which one finds in most alleged comedies is still half-baked; no one is going to mistake Couples Retreat for a serious motion picture. And the level of raunchiness is limited by Universals desire to release the film to the widest audience. How brash can a movie be if its PG-13? (Didnt the success of The Hangover change the game and prove that R-rated comedies can be profitable and popular?) Couples Retreat contains its share of minor hilarity. Theres a yoga scene for example that skirts the line of whats appropriate for a PG-13 movie and provokes laughter. Unfortunately there are long stretches between comedic highlights when not a lot of funny things are happening and these make the movie seem longer than its 110-minute running time. Its always a difficult thing for a first-time feature director like Peter Billingsley (best known as Little Ralphie in A Christmas Story) to balance comedy and drama and maintain a consistent tone; even experienced filmmakers can have difficulty with this. Couples Retreat has a sine-wave trajectory riding some humorous peaks then crashing into ho-hum valleys. Although this unevenness doesnt render the movie unwatchable it limits its ability to provide full satisfaction. The setup is long and tortured meaning that it takes about 25% of the movies screen time before the real story gets underway. We are introduced to four couples all friends. Theres Dave (Vince Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman) who have the ""perfect"" marriage. Theyre well-matched hardly ever argue and have two cute kids. Joey (Jon Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis) are awaiting the rapidly approaching day when their daughter will be moving out since that will be their cue to file for divorce. Shane (Faizon Love) has already been through the courts after being dumped by his wife Jennifer (Tasha Smith). Now hes hanging out with Trudy (Kali Hawk) a girl half his age. Finally theres the hyper-organized duo of Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) who love each other but are distressed about their inability to have a child. This is putting pressure on their relationship and causing them to re-think their marriage. The solution for Jason and Cynthia is a spending a week at the trendy couples resort of Eden which is run by a Frenchman named Marcel (Jean Reno). Unfortunately in order to be able to afford the vacation they need the discount group rate. After much prodding and pleading their friends agree so its off to Eden for seven days of food therapy and snorkeling. The promised windsurfing waterskiing and other ""fun"" stuff is not on the agenda for couples - its only there for singles headed for the hedonistic Eden East. Jason Cynthia et al. are bound for the more sedate Eden West. Does anyone think a trip midnight trip across the water might not be in order? At times Couples Retreat superficially recalls Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Hangover although it doesnt work as well as either. In terms of comedy the best scenes occur on the island. In addition to the aforementioned yoga class which is led by the outrageously muscled Salvadore (Carlos Ponce) theres a witty exchange between the men in a ""snow sauna"" (it has to do with the nature of infidelity) a snorkeling sequence involving a close encounter of the toothy kind and some amusing therapy sessions. The ending is rushed and weak but its probably about the best one could hope for given how the filmmakers wanted to wrap up things. The acting is a mixed bag. Jon Favreau and Faizon Love who never hit a false note are the standouts. Both are in complete synch with the material even when it enters moderately serious territory. Vince Vaughn is his usual self although he allows hints of maturity to slip into his performance. Jason Bateman is portraying a type thats starting to become overly familiar. Of the women only Malin Akerman seems at ease showing shes more comfortable in comedies than hanging out with blue-skinned giants. Kristen Bell who has lost a lot of her Veronica Mars spark Kristin Davis and Kali Hawk are largely forgettable. Of the supporting performers Carlos Ponce gets most of the laughs with a few reserved for Jean Reno and almost none for Temeura Morrison who pretty much stays in the background and bangs a gong. Despite being mediocre and largely forgettable Couples Retreat is not unpleasant although its easier to recommend it for home viewing than for a trip to a theater. Like Mike Judges Extract (which also featured Bateman) it contains enough worthwhile material to keep the average viewer engaged if not enthralled. And for those whose sole purpose in attending a comedy is to laugh that goal is achieved if not as consistently as one might hope.

Thats the overly familiar premise of this sun-poisoned comedy.Four couples from a snow-crusted suburb set off for a tropical retreat. Three of them are expecting rum rumba and relaxation. So theyre more than a little peeved when they find out theyre enrolled in an intensive relationship workshop.Couples Retreat introduces its cardboard characters and sets up the plot efficiently and with a fair degree of wit. But once this skit hits the sand all towels are off. The story and the humor get progressively skimpier than an Ipanema bikini.The alpha males are played by Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau which may surprise many of us who thought they were the same person. Jason Bateman and Faizon Love are the more pathetic guys roles that stifle the considerable comic talents of both.Their female companions are played by (respectively) Malin Akerman Kristin Davis Kristen Bell and Kali Hawk.There is surprisingly little exploration of gender differences in the script written by Favreau Vaughn and Dana Fox. Instead Couples Retreat takes aim at holistic pretension an easy and tired target.The resorts guru (Jean Reno with a ratty ponytail) is ""the worlds foremost couples whisperer.""The other played-out vein of humor is that the islands staff studs with indecipherable accents use an approach that is markedly feely-touchy. That recurring gag culminates in an obvious and offensive yoga session full of sexual pantomimes. It makes Borat look subtle.There is a sparkly turn for the reliably funny John Michael Higgins as a skeptical marriage therapist.The movie a tropical version of 1978s California Suite is typical of modern comedies a flip premise that gives way to a plot held together with more raised stitches than a baseball.In the end after all the mystic counseling and couples skill-building exercises it turns out that all they needed to heal their relationships was hot sex.They could have gotten that at Club Med - without having to explore their feelings.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 8 2009 248 PM Title Comedy about four couples who analyze their relationships while on vacation. With Jason Bateman Vince Vaughn Kristen Bell. Director Peter Billingsley (147). PG-13 Sexuality language. At area theaters.Ever go on a vacation where most of the people around seem to be having more fun than you? Then you already know what itll feel like to visit ""Couples Retreat.""In fairness a ticket to Peter Billingsleys predictable rom-com will get you two hours of spectacular scenery. And youll have a few laughs for sure. Just dont expect to enjoy yourself as much as everybody on screen.Even so its always nice to spend time with actors like Vince Vaughn and Jason Bateman. The latter plays Jason an uptight entrepreneur about to divorce the equally edgy Cynthia (Kristen Bell). They decide to give their relationship one last try by attending a marriage workshop at a tropical resort. (The movie was shot on Bora Bora.) They can only afford the group rate so theyve got to persuade their friends to come along.Ronnie (Malin Akerman) and Dave (Vaughn) are reluctant to leave their kids. Long-married Lucy (Kristin Davis) and Joey (Jon Favreau) can barely stand to be around each other. And newly divorced Shane (Faizon Love) hardly wants to discuss marriage with his twentysomething girlfriend (Kali Hawk).After Jason and Cynthia promise a relaxing week of surf n sun everyone finally agrees. But its clear on arrival that this is no Club Med. While singles get to party nearby the marrieds are stuck in a grueling relationship program devised by egomaniacal guru Marcel (Jean Reno). Given that the script was co-written by Favreau and Vaughn (along with Dana Fox) you might expect an update on 1996s ""Swingers"" in which they sharply dissected the male ego.Alas middle age seems to have tamed these two as the jokes range from mildly entertaining to disappointingly flat. Still even obvious gags have some zing when delivered by experts. The men in particular are consistently amusing. (We cant blame the ladies for their bland characters -- the screenwriters gave themselves all the best lines.) Bolstered by the gorgeous setting and likable cast ""Retreat"" hardly qualifies as a holiday from hell. But you might enjoy it more if you sneak a couple of pina coladas into the theater with you.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

You too will want to speedily flush this comic waste matter from your memory. Could Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau swingers forever in my comedy universe really have written and starred in such crap? And what dirt do they have on newbie director Peter Billingsley (Ralphie from A Christmas Story) that he lets them get away with it? Youd expect the plot -- four couples undergoing relationship therapy on a tropical island -- to be at least serviceable. Think again. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Get more news and reviews from Peter Travers on the Travers Take In a long movie (nearly two hours) Vaughn still has time to play Guitar Hero (plug) while his wife (Malin Akerman) learns why they called this Eden Hump Island. The reliably hilarious Jason Bateman is asked to play one note -- anal neurotic -- so we know why his wife (Kristen Bell) is at wits end. For me the saddest aspect of the movie is seeing the great French actor Jean Reno (The Professional) forced to make stupid faces as the ""couples whisperer."" Stretches of dud dialogue are interspersed with unsightly sight gags. The fat guy (Faizin Love) with the young girlfriend (Kali Hawk) has to get naked in front of everybody for morning exercises. Favreau grabs tissues and hand lotion to jerk off while his wife (Kristen Davis) takes a shower. This is after he pops a boner during massage therapy. You get my drift. The cast got to spend a month shooting on Bora Bora. So that explains why theyre in the movie. Why youd spend good money for a ticket to watch them have all the fun and not have any fun yourself passes understanding.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Couples Retreat"" is a pleasant undemanding middle-of-the-road comedy and really were you expecting anything else? If youre looking for plot narrative intricacy or layers of subtle characterization youre barking up the wrong palm tree. This is a movie about four amiable couples their low-level relationship woes and the sunny South Pacific getaway that makes everything all better. Its two hours of hammock time for your mind. There are worse ways to spend time. Vince Vaughn Jon Favreau Jason Bateman and Faizon Love are Chicago buddies whose marriages are respectively running on empty on the rocks hanging by a thread and toast. So that he and wife Kristen Bell can afford a Bora Bora resorts world-class marriage counseling Bateman sells his friends on the idea of chipping in for a luxury vacation at an unbeatable group rate. The other couples are focused on the resorts hot tubs and four-star restaurants. They dont understand how much baggage theyve brought until they land on the island where counseling turns out to be mandatory. Jean Reno is the islands guru-in-chief a renowned ""couples whisperer."" This sensitive fellow requires guests to get up before sunrise disrobe on the beach and perform suggestive yoga exercises with a buff shockingly limber instructor. Couple therapists pick apart the visitors relationship shortcomings expose long-nursed grievances and the friends realize theyre unhappier than they ever knew. The guys bond with the guys over booze and video games; the women empathize with the women in heart-to-hearts. You know Venus and Mars and all that. The men are endearing goofballs the wives are more grounded but interchangeable. Malin Akerman (""Watchmen"") plays Vaughns wife and Kristin Davis (""Sex and the City"") is Favreaus but their characters are as alike as two brands of designer water. That might be the point that theyve filtered away their essence through decades of compromise. Loves new squeeze a materialistic 20-year-old fly girl is a broad stereotype energetically played by Kali Hawk. Peter Billingsley (Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story"") directs the film in a matter-of-fact way. Most of the films gags are as obvious as clown shoes but in the right context clown shoes can make you snicker. There is a ticklish gag about a 5-year-old making mischief in a home center showroom a prickly cameo from John Michael Higgins as a passive-aggressive therapist and several good scenes involving Vaughns terror at snorkeling with harmless lemon sharks. COUPLES RETREAT  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual content and language. The male stars schlubby physiques -- as one of the staff tactfully puts it ""dormant muscles"" -- are regularly displayed for comic effect. There are slightly risque jokes involving hand lotion male nudity and masseurs. Whenever sex rears its lovely head the characters get flustered and act ridiculous so 10 points for realism. The story is piecemeal and it takes a while to tidy up all its business with so many actors running around but it kept me smiling throughout. The films heartwarming theme is that even when a partnership has devolved into bickering and boredom theres still something worth fighting for and a little 11th-hour soul-searching can always save the day. Its a slight but sweet coming-of-age story for middle-aged couples.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Husbands and wives of America Its Friday night and youve hired a baby sitter. The early-bird restaurant meal has been consumed; the multiplex beckons. Surely you want to see a frisky fun-filled comedy about married couples arguing bitterly over the attention theyre not giving each other the resentments theyre storing up the sex theyre not having. No? Better beat a retreat from ""Couples Retreat a movie for people who prefer to get their relationship advice from rich Hollywood stars.The movie is co-written by Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau whose breakthrough movie ""Swingers was 13 years ago and feels it. Vaughn plays Dave married to Ronnie (Malin Akerman) with two overly precocious Hollywood tykes (Gattlin Griffith Colin Baiocchi) and no downtime. Favreau is Joey stuck in mutual loathing with wife Lucy (Kristin Davis). Their big-bubba friend Shane (Faizon Love) is divorced and dating a 20-year-old mall clerk (Kali Hawk). Fourth wheel Jason (Jason Bateman) is a type-A twit who cant conceive a child with equally tense Cynthia (Kristen Bell).Are we having fun yet?Yes theres pointed human comedy to be mined from the very real stresses of married life but this bonehead idiots-in- paradise farce raises issues only to gloss them over. The four couples sign up for a Caribbean island getaway that turns out to be a relationship boot camp run by a touchy-feely Euro-guru (Jean Reno in a pigtail) and his metrosexual minions.In other words ""Couples Retreat pokes fun at fairly reasonable therapy-speak by putting it in the mouths of effeminate foreigners. Then it lets the heroes discover those same truths via Applebees metaphors and prominently displayed cases of Bud. Why isnt Tim Allen in this movie?There are some chuckles. Batemans habit of turning every aspect of his life into a PowerPoint presentation is funny and some of Vaughns and Favreaus lines have a good rude snap. Otherwise if the thought of a little boy pooping in a showroom toilet fills you with joy heres your movie. The bit where Vaughn is encircled by sharks might have worked if the sharks werent obviously digitally added later. Everything about ""Couples Retreat feels plastic though the jokes the trees the extras the attitudes. Its dumbed-down entertainment aimed at a dumbed-down audience - the comedy equivalent of a McMansion.By the way how can you tell this was written produced and directed by guys? All the husbands have SWUB (soft white underbellies) and all the wives are hotties. A bigger problem is that none of the characters is remotely likable. The first-time director is Peter Billingsley Vaughns producing partner and a former child actor best known as Ralphie in 1983s ""A Christmas Story. He doesnt put an eye out here but he comes damn close.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The marital comedy Couples Retreat features a running gag about a little boy in the midst of potty training who doesnt always go where its appropriate. In a nutshell that subplot explains everything thats wrong about the film Its propensity for barrel-scraping lowbrow gags its undisciplined catch-all approach to comedy and perhaps above all its chronic inability to focus on what its ostensibly about and cut away the extraneous stuff. Dealing with four relationships on the fritz--to say nothing of the friendships and rivalries within the group as a whole--is more than enough movie without adding potty-training jokes a humping yoga instructor improvised riffs about Applebees and a Guitar Hero showdown that doubles as a commercial. Then again when a movie is all fat its hard to know where to trim. Stranding a gifted cast on an all-inclusive trip to comedy hell Couples Retreat turns on the not-terrible idea of four couples heading to an impossibly gorgeous tropical getaway that doubles as a touchy-feely therapy resort. The catalysts for this journey are Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell who seem compatibly uptight but announce that theyre headed for divorce if they dont take this final shot at saving their marriage. With a little cajoling via PowerPoint presentation their friends agree to go in on the group rate but dont realize until they arrive that theyre expected to join in on the therapy sessions too. Turns out all of them need it Vince Vaughn and Malin Akerman have allowed parenthood and work to downgrade their marriage former high-school sweethearts Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis are still sowing their wild oats with other partners and Faizon Love is getting over a failed relationship by dating a 20-year-old (Kali Hawk) who calls him ""Daddy."" In their few exchanges together longtime collaborators Vaughn and Favreau (who get script credits too) have a casual joshing chemistry that throws the rest of the movie into sharp relief. The couples in the film seem mated in captivity and that goes double for the group dynamic which is strained and awkward well before a New Age Frenchman (Jean Reno) and a Speedo-wearing Fabio-type make them look really uncomfortable. Its hard to know if more convincing relationships would have made a difference in a movie so committed to funny accents and potty jokes but at least it would have shown some effort.

The compelling documentary Believe condenses the comedians fascinating life into 105 minutes of interviews archive material and -- most importantly to understanding any performer -- several decades of performance footage. Believe which was directed by Izzards ex-girlfriend Sarah Townsend suffers from the problem inherent in most Hollywood biopics Smashing a mans life into a series of ""very important moments"" creates a schizophrenic tone. Townsend also abbreviates several of Izzards early street and standup performances taking away key elements from her storys arc -- the development of Izzards onstage persona. Regardless Believe contains a good deal of footage thrilling to anyone excited by the backstage and onstage workings of live performance. Izzard also gives several genuinely poignant interviews saving the best -- a reflection on how the loss of his mother influenced his desire to be a comic -- for a strong emotional kick to punctuate the proceedings. The best moment however is the legendary performance in which Izzard appears for the first time in his trademark dress and pantyhose. This magnificent scene and others like it prove that as with comedy itself sometimes great material is enough to overcome merely average presentation. (Sunset 5) (John Wheeler) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - BLISS If you missed Junes The Stoning of Soraya M. heres another chance to be reminded of murderous misogyny in another Muslim community -- this time in Turkey. Based on a 2002 best-selling novel by Zulfu Livaneli Bliss creakily illustrates the clash between ancient abhorrent custom and modernity. Found unconscious by the side of the road in her village 17-year-old Meryem (Ozgu Namal) is held responsible for her own rape; a distant cousin Cemal (Murat Han) is summoned to take her to Istanbul to perform the ""honor killing"" for having shamed her family. The conflicted brute cant bring himself to murder Meryem and soon the two join Irfan (Talat Bulut) a sociology prof they meet while working at a fish farm on his yacht in the Aegean (filmed quite prettily by Mirsad Herovic) so that enlightenment can be taught as characters calcify into constructs. Though calling out the abominable oppression of women even in a vehicle as didactic as Bliss serves at least some redeemable purpose that mission is more than a little compromised when its suggested that Meryem could find happiness with Cemal -- the man who after he decides not to kill her settles on verbally and physically abusing her. (Music Hall) (Melissa Anderson)COUPLES RETREAT Couples retreat. In the latest from Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau (co-starring and co-writing) we learn that one compelling reason to make a life commitment is so you will always have someone to eat with at Applebees. The movies cumulative idea is that forgetting the delusions of midlife panic this is all there is youre already living the best possible life -- a message of sedentary wisdom betrayed when the actual film is as undeniably dreary as a plate of gummy Chicken Parmesan Tanglers. Vaughn Favreau (flagrantly shirtless) Jason Bateman and Faizon Love are four buddies just ""regular guys"" -- meaning as always puffy dull-minded lunks with Vaughn increasingly being Jim Belushis heir apparent. They take their respective significant others on a group vacation to an island paradise along with maybe 12 pages of sit-comic script outline to be riffed out into feature length. Arriving at the Eden Resort our beer-commercial heroes are menaced by enforced couples therapy and the resorts staff of Speedo-wearing homo-macho Euro-Hispanic Others (Jean Reno Carlos Ponce) who put them through yoga humpings and realityTV-type challenges intended to renew the spark missing from their relationships. The presence of Bateman begs comparison with the funnier-while-thematically-similar Extract though Retreat also recalls Voyage in Italy if Rossellini were to replace intimate human insight with lowest-common-denominator doody-boner-bare butt-jackoff haw-haws. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)GO  THE DAMNED UNITED We call it soccer but for the Brits its football and its damn serious business. From 1968 to 1974 Brian Clough (Michael Sheen) a manager/coach from the tiny town of Derby and his assistant manager Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall) turned a third-rate club into division champs. That success wasnt nearly as sweet as getting to take over Leeds United a top-tier team previously managed by Cloughs archenemy Don Revie (Colm Meaney). In this terrific film screenwriter Peter Morgan (The Queen Frost/Nixon) and television director Tom Hooper (John Adams) making his feature debut use a series of elegantly staged flashbacks to trace Clough and Taylors rapid rise to fame and the hubris that led the former to stumble badly when he got to Leeds while also wounding his lifelong friendship with Taylor. A movie about soccer that doesnt spend a lot of time on the field The Damned United like everything Morgan writes is an intimate character study one that is enriched by a stellar ensemble of British pros including Jim Broadbent as Derbys team owner. These actors are good at what they do -- like those soccer players who dodge and weave with effortless grace.

Sep. 13 600pm GOOD HAIR Don Imuss hateful racist 2007 remarks about ""nappy-headed hos"" underscored the immense fear of and fascination with the hair follicles of African-American women. Chris Rock the host co-writer and co-producer of first-time director Jeff Stilsons Good Hair never mentions Imus outburst; his interest in the political social and sexual entanglements of the tonsorial stem from the more personal -- specifically when one of his two young daughters plaintively asked ""Daddy how come I dont have good hair?"" Rock affable as ever queries a few black actresses (Nia Long providing the most candid responses ""Weave sex is a little awkward""); visits beauty salons; oversees an experiment by a scientist who demonstrates the corrosive effects of sodium hydroxide the main ingredient in hair relaxer; travels to Chennai India where women sacrifice hair that ends up in weaves costing thousands of dollars in the U.S.; and stares in disbelief at the Paris Is Burning-like competition at the annual Bronner Bros.-sponsored ""Hair Battle"" in Atlanta. Rock is certainly a sympathetic and curious observer though including Ice-Ts remark that ""a real pimp can tell what a woman looks like baldheaded"" betrays some of the gender politics that remain vigorously unexamined in this breezy superficial doc. (Citywide) (Melissa Anderson)THE HORSE BOY Theres a moment in the documentary The Horse Boy when the father of its subject an autistic child named Rowan explains his sons intrinsic understanding of nature by showing how he has organized his animal toys by species. The dad marvels that Rowan has grouped biologically close rhinos and pigs in the same box -- while ignoring the ostrich figurine thats also in there. This selective filtering of information is typical of the film a quest toward an inevitable inspirational destination continuing the recent trend of using precious theater space as dumping grounds for a-cinematic PBS also-rans. Mom and Dad take 6-year-old Rowan whose jagged tantrums are best relaxed by contact with horses on a riding tour of Outer Mongolia to consult tribal shamans in the hope of untangling his mental blocks. Its fun to imagine how The Horse Boys intended audience the nontraditional-therapy crowd would react to the same film if the parents took Rowan to exorcists in papal Rome -- just imagine a priest bringing up ""haunted wombs"" -- but the Third World Otherness does wonders. The Horse Boy may excuse itself as a ""raising awareness"" tract on autism but the exotic travelogue isnt a practicable care option for most cases and it certainly isnt worthy cinema. (Nuart) (Nick Pinkerton)GO  MR. RIGHT For Londoner Louise (Georgia Zaris) the man of her dreams (Jeremy Edwards) turns gay when she least expects it which may actually be Louises fault -- all her friends are gay men and as the makers of this well-crafted romantic comedy slyly suggest gay may indeed be contagious. Co-directed by the sister-and-brother team of Jacqui and David Morris (he wrote the script and plays a small role) Mr. Right smoothly tracks the romantic lives of Louises friends which include her BFF Alex (Luke de Woolfson) whose relationship with a TV producer (James Lance) is derailed by a hunky hustler (Benjamin Hart) who in turn has grown weary of his own sugar daddy (Morris). Theres also a single-parent art dealer (Rocky Marshall) whos afraid to introduce his new boyfriend (Leon Ockenden) into his daughters life. If that sounds like a lot of characters to keep up with it is for a while but one gradually sorts out who goes with whom. When nearly all the couples break up at a midfilm dinner party the Morrises and their likable grounded cast manage to steer clear of silliness and shrill melodrama. In a refreshingly adult manner love eventually finds its way back to almost everyone though poor Louise might do well to just throw up her hands and go lesbian. (Sunset 5) (Chuck Wilson)GO  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY For Katie (Katie Featherston) a San Diego college student things have been going bump in the night since she was 8 years old and a ghost attached itself to her. The unseen being that has been benignly haunting her for years thrills Katies loving but skeptical boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) who sets up a video camera to capture any supernatural goings-on. For his debut feature reportedly shot in seven days at a cost of 15 grand writer-director Oren Peli works wonders with stationary camera footage of the sleeping couple The bedroom door moves slightly; lights in the hallway go on and off; a shadow passes the bed. As the nights pass the presence seemingly annoyed at being recorded begins upping the ante and soon it appears that poor Katie is on the verge of channeling her inner Linda Blair. Grounded by strong performances by newcomers Featherston and Sloat who pretty much have the movie to themselves Paranormal Activity which demands to be seen in a crowded theater is refreshingly blood-free -- the fact that its old-school scares caused seemingly jaded 20-somethings at a recent midnight screening to squirm in their seats suggests that theres hope for the world after all. (ArcLight Hollywood) (Chuck Wilson) PETER AND VANDY Middlebrow Sundance product is the scourge of American independent cinema today -- those innocuously ""arty"" totally commercial and barely-left-of-mainstream films that trick the masses into feeling smarter and edgier than deserved (see Little Miss Sunshine Juno and dozens of titles aiming to be both). Jay DiPietros modest directorial debut Peter and Vandy is at least impassioned but if the film hadnt been adapted from his 2002 play about a strained romance chronicled out of temporal sequence wed dismiss it as a cut-rate (500) Days of Summer -- itself a cut-rate example of the aforementioned fest genre. Temperamental and passive-aggressively inarticulate downtown NYC 20-somethings Peter (Jason Ritter) and Vandy (Jess Weixler) confess their love cruelly project their insecurities during inane fights over how to make a PBamp;J sandwich meet for the first time and on and on through the back-and-forth span of their relationship. Ritter and Weixler do share an easy-at-being-uneasy chemistry mostly because his performance is downright distinguished compared to her blandness but DiPietros screenplay is emotionally myopic. His sharpest written exchanges -- and there arent many -- are buried under his inexplicable need to embrace the nonlinear conceit. Did we mention theres indie rock?

Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn team up again on screen and on the script (along with Dana Fox) for this broad comedy about four couples who go on a tropical vacation together. In theory theyre all there to support their friends Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) as they try to save their marriage through the couples counseling the resort offers. Little do they know theyll get sucked into agonizing therapy sessions that reveal their own rifts. For example Vaughns character Dave doesnt care about picking out tile to redo the kitchen. His wife Ronnie (Malin Akerman) does. Its a laugh riot if you think Paul Reisers ""Couplehood"" is funny -- and we havent even gotten to their painfully cute young son whose defining personality trait is urinating and pooping in inappropriate places. Under the direction of Peter Billingsley (Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story"") another longtime Vaughn friend and collaborator making his first feature ""Couples Retreat"" veers back and forth in a jarring way between crude sexual humor and supposedly poignant moments. The couples endure forced nudity and a wildly erotic yoga class; Favreaus character Joey and his wife Lucy (Kristin Davis) who married right after high school each try to get it on with their respective massage therapists. But all must also bare their souls which feels wedged-in and unconvincing compared to the proliferation of physical humor. Faizon Love rounds out the group as the divorced Shane who brings along his 20-year-old girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk) a shrill party girl who likes to call him ""Daddy"" and pour hot wax on his naked chest. Video Couples Retreat review Each of these characters is exactly the same person the whole way through until one night when they all magically experience an epiphany that makes them more communicative patient and loving. During such moments a distracting feel-good score -- surprisingly from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" Oscar-winner A.R. Rahman -- pipes in early and often. Video Vince Vaughn on Couples Retreat ""Couples Retreat"" makes fun of the people who run the place including the New Age-y mastermind Monsieur Marcel (Jean Reno in a braided tail and a Speedo) and the condescending concierge Sctanley (Peter Serafinowicz) -- spelled with a ""c."" But ultimately it embraces the very lessons the resort is trying to teach. It also finds time for a little shameless product placement along the way an extended ad for ""Guitar Hero"" right as the movie is approaching its big revelatory climax. A few funny lines and ideas emerge here and there -- the rigid Jasons fondness for PowerPoint presentations is vaguely amusing -- but ""Couples Retreat"" mostly feels repetitive and overlong at nearly two hours. You wouldnt mind getting voted off this island. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.

""Couples Retreat"" is one of those movies that makes moviemaking look like the luckiest job in the world. Those involved got to spend weeks at a Bora Bora luxury resort; all we get is this not lousy but unmemorable tropical-vacation comedy. Reuniting several frequent past collaborators (most notably ""Swingers"" alums Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau) the tale of four couples at a relationship workshop in an exotic locale has a good premise an appealing cast and some bright ideas that only fly so high due to pedestrian execution. Still pleasant-enough results should earn solid midrange B.O. numbers. After a nice opening-credits montage of couples imagery since cinemas beginning were introduced to various Illinois duos. Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman) have a happy slightly chaotic household with two young sons and a normal amount of stress. On the other hand former high school sweethearts Joey (Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis) are just hanging on until their daughters imminent departure for college at which point theyll gladly separate. Shane (Faizon Love) has recently divorced the wife he could never please (Tasha Smith) and taken up with 20-year-old wild thang Trudy (Kali Hawk). She calls him ""Daddy"" -- which indeed he might be mistaken for. And though they seem perfect for each other persnickety pair Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) drop a bombshell After eight years wedlock undone by failure to conceive they worry they arent soulmates after all. Determined to give it one last shot Jason and Cynthia have found a program -- at the alluring Eden Resort billed as ""Disneyland for adults"" -that could salvage their relationship. Trouble is they can only afford the group rate. They beg the others to sign on promising them they can enjoy fun in the sun while Cynthia and Jason work on ""renewing bonds."" Upon arrival Eden (actually the St. Regis in Bora Bora) proves duly idyllic and the inevitable tourist shots of its splendid setting come as a relief after thesp-turned-producer-turned-first-time-director Peter Billingsleys blah-looking first reel. But world-famed ""couples whisperer"" Marcel (Jean Reno) has a program in store thats much more intensive than expected. Far from being allowed to snorkel doze and work on their tans the couples are expected -- even demanded -- to rise at dawn for ""skill-building exercises"" that are like a kind of New Age boot camp. These push the central duos -- and the friendships between them -- to near-breakup points. While the inevitable happy endings are orchestrated with just enough finesse to satisfy elsewhere ""Couples Retreat"" wobbles. The screenplay (credited primarily to Favreau with Vaughn and Dana Fox billed beneath) sports a fair number of good throwaway lines but could be a lot sharper overall. Billingsleys workmanlike helming delivers a couple of hilarious scenes; the PG-13 pics raunchiest moments include a frustrating erotic-massage interlude for Lucy and Joey and a sexually inappropriate yoga class taught by hunky Salvadore (Carlos Ponce). Yet elsewhere the helmer impresses too little imagination or personality failing to blend seriocomic tones that occasionally tumble into the heavy-handed maudlin or cloying (via some horribly precocious child-actor moments). Pic moves briskly but at 113 minutes clocks long for a mainstream comedy; more inspiration in tech/design departments would have been welcome. Thesps remain amiable even if all have been deployed to greater advantage elsewhere -- the exception being relative newcomer Hawk whose character is a giddy party-hearty contrast to the older principals and whose performance is a consistent hoot.

Couples Retreat Bad to Fair Director Peter Billingsley. Cast Jon Favreau Vince Vaughn Kristen Bell. Rating PG-13 for sexual content and language. Related Peter Billingsley All grown up making films Vaughn and Billingsley The tall and short of it Spotlight Vince Vaughn Sexy and funny Travel films In the basketball showcase the best players in the world stage a game thats often fun with seemingly one highlight dunk after another. But no one wants to do the dirty work - in this example playing defense - that makes real games so intense and competitive. In the case of ""Couples Retreat"" a team of comedy all-stars including Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau who wrote the script (along with Dana Fox) nail a few showy set pieces. But neither they nor director Peter Billingsley (yes the shoot-your-eye kid from ""A Christmas Story"") want to do the difficult job of crafting a compelling story. So youre left with some entertaining bits that dont add up to a satisfying whole wondering how this many funny people could fall so flat. Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) an uptight couple who cant get pregnant and whose marriage is suffering because of it convince their friends to go to an island resort that specializes in couples therapy. Reluctant at first they agree. Theres Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman) parents too busy to pay attention to their relationship; Joey (Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis) who married in high school and wonder how much fun they missed; and Shane (Faizon Love) and Trudy (Kali Hawk) - hes recently divorced and shes a 20-year-old party animal with whom he simply cant keep up. Jason and Cynthia genuinely want to work on their marriage to try to save it. Everyone else is in it for the umbrella drinks and the jet skis. But the trip proves more demanding than they would like including a daily session with Marcel (Jean Reno) a new-age guru who specializes in empty-headed bromides and exercises. Therapy sessions reveal problems obvious to everyone but the couples experiencing them (though any excuse to get John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeong into your movie is worth it). Its a set-up ripe for racy R-rated comedy with heart the kind of thing Vaughn and Favreau have done well in the past and which directors such as Judd Apatow have mined the last few years for so many rich laughs. But ""Couples Retreat"" is a PG-13 film which on its face is fine. But its also symptomatic Vaughn Favreau and Billingsley just arent willing to go far enough to make the movie as funny as it ought to be instead relying on sappy resolutions achieved far too easily. No one in the cast is bad exactly; in fact most are just fine. But they should be more than that. Only Carlos Ponce as a somewhat ahem overenthusiastic yoga instructor really takes any chances and hes hilarious. ""Couples Retreat"" alas is not and you cant shake the disappointment in knowing that with a little more effort it could have been. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"Couples Retreat Movie review of Couples Retreat by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Couples Retreat -- 2 out of 5 stars Jason Bateman and Vince Vaughn Universal Universal Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Couples Retreat was made because of its sunny sandy location scenic Bora Bora. Judging from the light cast members slept late and took it pretty easy even in the ""We rise at dawn"" scenes.Pals Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau team up again. They co-wrote this and still love working together even though their banter isnt what it was in their Swingers days. And they pitch in to help a pal behind the camera. Director Peter Billingsley ""Ralphie"" in A Christmas Story befriended them when they first got to Hollywood.But are those reasons for making the movie or excuses? Couples a sputtering if sporadically amusing misfire packed a lot of actors off to a pretty location and gave them nothing funny or deep to do. Four couples -- Vaughn and Malin Akerman Favreau and Kristin Davis Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell and Faizon Love and Kali Hawk -- are lured (theyre friends) to Eden a resort where Power Point type As (Bateman and Bell) hope to save their micro-managed marriage. Seeing as how theyre not believable or likable as a couple you wonder why.Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Davis) are happily cheating on one another seen in the TV commercials for the movie scenes omitted from the finished film. Shane (Love) is newly divorced and trying to keep up with a 20-year-old girlfriend.And Dave (Vaughn) their dependable pal is just there for support. Naturally he and wife Ronnie (Akerman) hit a rough patch the moment their marriage goes under the microscope.With yoga and counseling (John Michael Higgins and Ken Jeoung earn a grin as therapists) massages and sessions with the arrogant guru in charge (Jean Reno) these twosomes will re-light the marital fires. None of the couples is interesting enough to carry the movie and a sauna riff-off is only an echo of vintage Vince and Jon. Theyre reduced to kiddie potty jokes and tacky sex gags here.When your big pay-off is a ""Guitar Hero"" playoff ""retreat"" is the word the writers should embrace. Unless they have their hearts set on that trip to Bora Bora.Couples Retreat Two of five starsCast Vince Vaughn Jon Fravreau Kristen Bell Malin Akerman Faizon Love Jason Bateman Kristin DavisDirector Peter BillingsleyRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesIndustry rating PG-13 on appeal for sexual content and language.

They were friends who each acted like a spiky entourage of one; their bond -- figuring out how to impress a girl by pretending not to care about her -- was built around bolstering each others egos by getting in each others faces. Swingers which Favreau wrote came out ? 13 years ago but once youve seen Couples Retreat the mediocre funnier-at-times-than-you-expect more-middle-class-stodgy-than-it-should-have-been new comedy about four couples (most of them old friends) who attempt to heal their relationships at a New Age therapeutic resort it feels as if it came out about 113 years ago. Vaughn and Favreau are still getting in each others faces but what a difference a ? decade makes. Weve all heard of failing upward; with Couples Retreat Vaughn and Favreau seem to be succeeding downward. Written by both of them (along with Dana Fox) and directed by Peter Billingsley its one of those comedies in which each couple comes with its own cute tics and tidy conflicts -- like say ? Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) who are fraying each others nerves because they cant conceive a child (they also fray the nerves of the audience by explaining their lives as a PowerPoint presentation). Or Shane (Faizon Love) the roly-poly divorced dude who brings along his high-lariously ? inappropriate paramour 20-year-old party girl Trudy (Kali Hawk) who likes to call him ""Daddy"" from across crowded rooms. As for Vaughn and Favreau theyre the beleaguered hanging-in-there marital vets. Vaughns Dave is a relatively centered father who despite being chained to his job as a videogame salesman would do well to stop brushing off the minor requests of his wife Ronnie (Malin Akerman as a miraculously radiant overworked mother of two). Favreaus Joey is an angry lug trapped in a union of toxic insincerity with Lucy (Kristin Davis) who knows how to give as bad as she gets. Kicking off their package-deal vacation which theyve all been roped into out of solidarity with Jason and Cynthia and their fertility issues the eight arrive at Eden an idyllic island of luxury huts and aqua-blue ocean (Joey ""Holy s-- this looks like a screensaver"") in Bora Bora. But of course its a bogus paradise. There are circling sharks ""Couples Skill Building"" counselors with even sharper teeth a goofy idiot of a French guru (Jean Reno) and an even more idiotic French Fabio of a yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce) who pins everyone into high-lariously overt sexual positions. Meanwhile bubbling just under the surface of the films variety pack of marital strife is that prickly Vaughn/Favreau hostility. Favreau now plays men with incredibly short fuses and hes funny every time his gets lit. He also does great double takes when a waiter catches him attempting to pleasure himself to a brochure photo. As for Vaughn he remains a testy master of talking circles around himself as in the moment when Dave realizes that his assigned couples therapist played with yummy smugness by John Michael Higgins is doing all he can to make the marriage worse. Later after being nicked by a shark Vaughn turns his ""close encounter"" with death into an anxiety attack that keeps on giving. The movie builds toward a clandestine group voyage to the other side of the Eden resort the section of the island devoted to Dionysian Jell-O-shot-happy singles. To our jaded couples its forbidden paradise -- a fleshpot Bali Hai. Up until this point Couples Retreat has a pleasantly relaxed episodic rhythm. As the plot kicks in it grows more impersonal though I did enjoy the ""athletic"" climax a Guitar Hero duel amusing because even the winners victory is so desperately vicarious. Couples Retreat is fluff a genially banal message comedy about learning to live with your spouse by staying true to yourself. But thanks to Vaughn Favreau and the stray sharp lines that pop out of everyone else the film at least offers the lively sound of egos that still know how to swing. B?
