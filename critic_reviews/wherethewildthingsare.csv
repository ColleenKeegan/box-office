Yeah Christopher Nolan invites us to think when you put it like that I can see why a guy might dress up as a bat and fight crime. Peter Jackson doesnt just want us to marvel at or pity a 20ft ape he wants to unpack its abandonment issues. And recently Wes Anderson granted a talking animal enough pop-psych introspection to acknowledge I have this thing where I need everyone to think Im this quote-unquote Fantastic Mr Fox.Spike Jonzes adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are Maurice Sendaks beloved story about Max a naughty boy in a wolf suit who sails away to an exotic jungle and meets giant beasties who make him their king takes this tendency even further. In expanding the couple of dozen pages of Sendaks picture-book to feature length Jonze and his co-writer Dave Eggers approach atavistic fantasy with jarring formal and psychological realism. The forest desert and mountain locations are real as are the creature costumes (CGI facial expressions aside); beautifully photographed often in handheld shots and magic-hour light these landscapes and figures have a solidity weight and detail that feels uncanny in an age of virtual imagining.Lumbering around their island with satisfying heft these weird beasts - hybrids of human animal and mythical parts that faithfully realise Sendaks drawings - have an oddly quotidian social dynamic and comically normal names insecure Judith and Alexander (voiced by Catherine OHara and Paul Dano) more assured Ira and Douglas (Forest Whitaker and Chris Cooper) gruff but vulnerable Carol (James Gandolfini). Feeling less like a pack of monsters than a group of long-arrested adolescents left to their own devices they entertain crushes grudges and neuroses pile gleefully into group projects sustain minor injuries and go off in sulks yearning for structure and security all the while. Think Lord of the Flies on Fraggle Rock. Finding himself in loco parentis Max must take emotional responsibility and one of the films pleasures is young Max Recordss deft and unaffected portrayal of this shift. Its hard to guess whether many children will enjoy the movie. Ponderous at times it could probably be 15 minutes shorter and lacks a real sense of mortal danger. Theres also sometimes an over-determined feel to the correspondences between the island adventure and Maxs real life with his mother (Catherine Keener) and sister as laid out in the opening scenes. But Where the Wild Things Are stands out for its unusually potent evocation of the timbre of childhood imagining with its combination of the outre and the banal grand schemes jumbled up with delicate feelings and the urge to smash things up.

I didnt see any clear message come out of it at the end. Overall it was totally unengaging it moved very slowly with pointless philosophy chucked in to try and appeal to adults. The CGI was pretty rubbish as well.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 10 2010jojoFeaturedi hated it. it had no plot or storyline. dont even bother reading the back of the case. dont even give it to anybody ether. uuuughFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 11 2010Rochelle NorlundFeaturedI really like this movie because I like the designs of where the movie takes place and designs of the characters which Spike Jonze Dave Eggers Maurice Sendak Max Records Catherine Keener James Gandolfini Lauren Ambrose and many more did wonderful jobs on this movie. I also like the scenes that has to do with Carol (Gandolfini) and Max (Records) because they both act like father and son figures to each other while KW (Ambrose) acting like a mother figure to Max. I also like the tokens of affection both Carol and Max shared together when they both with each other which I believe that is so very sweet cute amazing and beautiful. I also wish theres going to be a sequel to this movie so everyone will want to know on what will happen to Max if hes going to go back to the island of the Wild Things and what will happen to Carol if hes going to apologize to Max for trying to eat him and if he wants to see Max again so they could be a family once again. Maybe just maybe Carol and KW will still be together as a wonderful couple have their first kiss with everyone and the audience watching (Mmmmmmmmmmm) and maybe have a baby together. Maybe if the Wild Things are going to see Max on his island maybe Carol could build a boat that will be big enough for all 7 Wild Things so it will not sink or be too weak for their weight and theyll see Max and live with Max and his family and be part of his life and his family so Carol could still be a father to Max and Max could still be a son to Carol with the same cast of WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE movie.

The story is of Max realizing that he had been a selfish brat all along and developing enough maturity to return home. I thought the use of all the monsters representing facets of his personality or influences in his life was really well done. And the climax where he ended up in the role of his mother while Carol was an out of control brat was very effective. Ill admit this was advertised very poorly towards kids and all because really it was a fairly deep film that no child could really comprehend.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 29 2010DineshFeaturedThis film is not suitable for kids yet it is aimed at children. I had to take my son out after 30mins as it raised serious issues (death single parenting problems mum bringing home boyfriend etc) that upset him.

I took my 8 yr old daughter; both of us being very eager to see this film that is being hailed as a modern masterpiece and an instant classic. We sat there stunned as this wonderful book was totally gutted and left hanging to dry. Nothing like the book at all. All the monsters were constantly arguing and mad at each other everybody seemed like they were manic-depressive running around feeling guilty depressed angry sad etc. The entire spectrum of negative emotions was thoroughly explored in this movie. I felt manipulated while watching this steaming turd. It felt like some strange government psy-op designed to bring out the worst in people. There were hardly ANY happy moments throughout the entire movie; all the characters (both human and non-human) moped about sadly throughout the film; crying wallowing in self-pity anguish depression and self-inflicted psychological punishment. Several small children were crying in the theater because it was so sad and negative Im not kidding. I am so angry at being deceived. The ads for this film portray it as a positive magical journey when it was just the opposite. All it is is a flaming exercise in negativity and self-indulgent wallowing. The movie is jam-packed with subliminal messages and suggestions all designed to make you feel bad about yourself and others. This one will make you feel awful inside for several hours after you leave the theater. NO REDEEMING QUALITIES WHATSOEVER. Nothing but a big shameful sad-fest. I wish I could get my money back. No I wish I could go back in time and choose never to see it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 30 2009briggsFeaturedCouldnt wait to leave the cinema. Total and utter garbage.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 29 2009KateFeaturedBeautiful film visually but seriously lacking in plot and substance. I thought this was a bit scary and menacing for kids - a couple of littlies cried from fear at one point during my screening. I am scoring it 2 stars for beauty -thats it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 27 2009ChrisFeaturedfeels like a woody Allen film with the socially inept characters. Liked the atmosphere of the melancholic lighting but it only got 6/10 from my 9 year old son (and he was being polite). Probably more for the grown ups looking back at lost youth than kids looking for adventure and wild things.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 23 2009jinkaFeaturedI found this film beautiful moving and funny everything you want in a family film. Pixar have made so many brilliant family films they have turned it into a formula with CGI and talking inanimate objects being at the forefront. So I found it very refreshing to see WTWA. It adapted many aspects of the book. It had to because its an adaptation Which is very ironic as was the subject mater of Jonzes last movie. the studios wanted him to compromise on many things. The melancholy and anger of Max being two of them. However the book is about a childs imagination as a coping mechanism to a world he doesnt understand. WTWA embraces this. And with Sendak as producer and working along side the script I think people should stop being so precious about the changes made. It is dark at times yes but we all know what happens to Bambis mother. Its time to stop wrappign kids in cotton wool and show them a glimpse of the real world no matter how wild it is.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 22 2009Penni CliftFeaturedTotally underwhelming. Poor script. Take your kids to see another film at ChristmasFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 21 2009aartiFeaturedwent to see this film with great expectation .. but thought the film was complete rubbish.. no story line.. didnt feel or connect with any character senseless plotline.. just didnt work. also a child who bites his mum.. and thinks its ok.... well should be grounded... i wouldnt call that as  a child who is not been given enough attention was terribly disappointed with this film. cant believe time out gave it 4 starts.. what is with that??? give this film a miss. like seriouslyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 21 2009AFeaturedI loved amp; disliked this file in equal mesaures. I found it a bit long it lacked a story amp; never really went anywhere. However it completely absorbed me amp; took me to a magical world which seemed totally beleivable. I though the boy who played Max was brilliant. The only thought that was running through my head whilst I sat in the nearly empty cinema last wednesday morning was that I would rather be tucked up in bed watching this on a rainy sunday morning.I suspect I will do just that when the DVD comes out. lastly I would not say this is a kids film at all much as I thought the wonderful Fantastic Mr. Fox wasnt either. As a 32 yr old I am quite glad I can enjoy these child-like adult films.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 19 2009JoeFeaturedworst movie ever save ur money and watch something else. wouldnt give this film 1 star let alone the 4 stars its being rated.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 19 2009fueldragsterFeaturedOh dear where to begin. Short response avoid this and save your money. I took my 3 to see it based on the trailer (Id never read them the book) and using various terms we all thought it was a waste of time. Now Ive heard of this book over the last (30?) years mentioned on the radio seen figures used in bookshops etc and had assumed that its fame was justified. I have since made a point of borrowing a copy and was surprised to find that the book is so flimsy a story that it never desrved to be filmed. Even with the extensions that the production team introduce (the sister that will no longer play the single mum the fort and mud-fight) it remains too weak. If you want to worship at the altar of Mr. Sendak be my guest but I simply do not understand how this acheived any success in the first place. As far as I can make out the Max in the book is a troublesome brat that quickly tires of his imagination and gets ""homesick"" for his supper the extended version in the film just makes the charachter more obnoxious. A depressing pile of tripe I have not felt my familys time as utterly wasted for many a moon. If this could be given a negative rating Id push the button it deserves less than a ""1"".FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 18 2009ScottFeaturedSometimes in life you should be able to enjoy things and not know why. I disagree with people that say this film is rubbish. True the story doesnt develop a whole lot. True there was no sea monster. True there was some violence (but in good humour there was no killing or gore. They were throwing mud at at each other) The boy needed some attention not a grounding. It was truely beautiful and full of emotion and just fun to watch. My concentration lapsed in parts but this did not ruin the film nor make me want to leave. Id say go and watch it and just see if you dont shed a tear at the end.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 18 2009Long catFeaturedI went to see this movie with great expectations from the trailer. Unfortunately the trailer was better than the actual movie. A pointless tedious rendition of a classic book. Dark menace and idiotic creatures and a kid whos behaviour should be grounded for a year. The movie didnt exactly go anywhere except disappoint. Give it a miss.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 17 2009joFeaturedWorst film I have ever seen Dont know how it was classified as PG. it was full of violence and menacing. Dont bother to see itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 15 2009leelFeaturedI took my 5 year old - who loves the book. He was disappointed that the film was not true to the book - Maxs room did not turn into a forest - he just ran out of the house and got into a boat. And there was no Sea monster as he sailed to the land where the wild things live. As a parent I thought this film was very dark and quite menacing and not at all like the well loved book. I kept looking at my son expecting him to be terrified and want to leave but he loved it He found all the scary quite violent parts funny - to my amazement However I would not recomment it to my friends (it is a violent and scary film) and we wont be getting it on DVDFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 14 2009LaurenFeaturedI was looking forward to this so much but came away completely disapointed. The little boy was completely selfish from start to finish- the whole point of the film is for him to realise that hes been selfish not to decide to go home purely for his own benefit. He was made into too much of a horror head at the beginning of the film- its like they thought they needed to create a monster for us to understand the wild things- bad move- they should have kept it as it was in the book. The kid realises and comes home before its an issue. In this film the kid comes home after its an issue and is a smug little git about it. The Wild Things are actually really menacing- I was constantly anxious the boy was going to be seriously injured... it would have scared me when I was little. Storyline was lacking but hey the book isnt very long. The cinematography was lovely- I liked the costumes and the locations- for that I will give this two stars- the rest of it was not good.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 14 2009usman khawajaFeaturedembarrassingly bad even for kids this is totally unfair and misleading for audiences to submit toFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 12 2009JessFeaturedI actually really enjoyed this. It didnt have much of a developed story line but the characters were all created so well and we really got an insight into Maxs mind. It was a well made film featuring some awazing scenery and good characters. I enjoyed it a lot.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 12 2009PabloFeaturedrubbish. pure rubbish. Time Out how much money the director gave you to rate this with 4 star?? people left the cinema after 40 minutes of movie.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 15 2009 426PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Where The Wild Things Are Directed by Spike Jonze Written by Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers Starring Max Records James Gandolfini and Catherine OHara Classification PG Wild Things you do not make my heart sing. Spike Jonzes film version of Maurice Sendaks 1963 childrens classic Where the Wild Things Are is less an adaptation of its source material than a therapeutic response to it. Sendaks book is a witty and concise (338 words) allegory about a high-spirited five-year-olds rage fantasy and ultimate mastery childhood emotions. The Jonze movie co-written by novelist Dave Eggers ( A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius ) is an exploration of childhood sorrow. Its about an emotionally neglected nine-year-old (Max Records) who exhibits behaviour problems as he witnesses his parents divorce. Forget about Maxs cry to let the wild rumpus start. This feels more like ""Let the grief-counselling ensue."" Not that Jonze could be faulted for any inconsistencies in his approach. The movie could even be called visionary inasmuch as its the product of a strongly individualistic visual and narrative style. Jonze who directed Being John Malkovich and Adaptation from Charlie Kauffmans scripts is a specialist at solipsistic reveries. Eggers shares Jonzes preciousness as does the soundtrack by indie rock star Karen O. To begin the film Jonze is on harder realistic territory shooting handheld family psychodrama. The angelic-looking Max lives in a suburban home with his overworked single mother (Catherine Keener) and an adolescent older sister who has no time for him. When his sisters friends trash his snow fort Max angrily retaliates by wrecking the things in her room. Initially his mother consoles him. When she brings home a date (Mark Ruffalo) Max dons his wolf suit talks back climbs on the table and finally bites his mothers shoulder in anger. As she sobs hysterically he runs out of the house into the winter night. Soon he comes to the edge of some water where a boat is waiting to take him to island of generic fantastic landscapes - mountains deserts and forests. There he finds a half-dozen Wild Things monsters that have some relationship to the stuffed animals in Maxs bedroom. The puppets are massive and hand-made and as gnarly-looking as ancient relatives with digitally changeable facial expressions. Unlike the book theyre also talkative with voices of actors James Gandolfini Paul Dano Catherine OHara Forest Whitaker Michael Berry and Chris Cooper. Theyre also conscienceless and destructive ready to devour Max just because hes small and available. But Max practised in making up stories for his mother convinces the creatures he has secret powers and is declared King of the Wild Things. After declaring the tree-shaking wild rumpus he crashes and wakes in a furry monster pile. Now its time for Max to start to accept responsibility and watching the film begins to feel like heavy lifting. This is not exactly the monument to self-pity of Kauffmans Synecdoche New York  but there are similarities. In Wild Things  biggest departure from the book the creatures arent just symbols of feelings; theyre full of enough anxieties jealousy and fears for an Ingmar Bergman drama. ""Will you keep out all the sadness?"" one asks Max after hes named King. Carol (Gandolfini) is both the warmest and most violent of the creatures which is amusing casting (who would want Tony Soprano for an Id?). But the creatures generally seem less physically threatening than those in Sendaks book. The scariest character from a mental-health perspective may be OHaras Judith who persistently insinuates that Max is a fraud and a poor leader. After engaging the creatures in a giant make-work project Max turns into a parent himself frightened and worried when his creatures get out of control. With this life-lesson learned its time for him to sail home from Where the Serotonin-Challenged Things Are. Who exactly is this self-consciously sad film for? Possibly its aimed at adults who remembering the book from their childhoods may see this retelling as a parable about childhood loss. If they need relief from the lugubrious funk left by the movie a renewed acquaintance with Sendaks boisterous book should do the trick.

In Maurice Sendaks beloved ""Where the Wild Things Are"" about a boy named Max who journeys to a place inhabited by creatures that declare him king you found your inner ""rumpus"" to borrow a word. And yes you went wild. Sendaks childrens book first published in 1963 is the easiest pre-review homework ever -- and among the loveliest. But the awesomely illustrated classic is all of 10 sentences long. Theres more language in the first minute of this big-screen version written by Jonze and David Eggers. Jonze has accomplished something special. He has made an emotionally faithful adaptation that advances the vivid spirit of the original -- though you may find it hard to make peace with the movies similar-but-different ending. I did. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" begins on a snowy neighborhood street. Industrious Max is playing alone building an ice fort near his house. As Max young actor Max Records hits many a painfully right note. Max is sweet. He can also be impossible. He is 9 after all. And ""Where the Wild Things Are"" underscores the ""id"" in kid. He is a boy raised by a single mom. She understands him. But he doesnt seem to have friends. The movie itself verges -- so artfully -- on the untamed. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is flush with its own peculiar energy. War whoops reminiscent of childhood cowboy-Indian skirmishes can be heard in the background when Max runs. Barks too. Jonze and cinematographer Lance Acord a longtime collaborator move the camera which shoots from a youngsters vantage with unbridled verve. The camera is Maxs companion. Max laughs plays rages. He is a mad puppy howling and baring his teeth and occasionally biting too hard. He is a wild thing. When his teen sister disappoints he reacts. He destroys a gift hed given her once When his mother asks him to behave he loses it. It wont be lost on adults in the audience that his tantrum comes after he sees Mom with a man (Mark Ruffalo making a terse appearance). One indelible sight Max standing on the kitchen counter in a furry costume shouting at his mother ""Feed me woman"" Catherine Keener is Mom. Its a lovely muted turn. She is caretaker as well as cultivator of her boys imagination. After an aggravating work-related phone call she sits in front of her computer monitor. Max has been hanging about trying to distract her. Now lying beneath her desk he touches her toes. She asks for a story. Multitaskers might think shes not really listening as she begins typing. Truth is she is deeply hearing. No wonder when Mom does say ""No"" it sends Max over the edge. He tears out of the house and into the night. He tumbles through woods and finds a boat. Like the Max of the book he sets sail. The story of Maxs time on the island of unruly misfits can be read as an allegory about the feral aspects of imagination co-written by two fine practitioners of the creative. Jonze directed two powerfully idiosyncratic features ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."" Both were written by Charlie Kaufman so it would be wrong to sever the brilliance from its author. But Jonze understood embraced made visual Kaufmans wondrously intricate narratives. Jonzes music-video work has become the stuff of legend. Hes a skate dude. Co-writer Eggers burst on the scene with ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" a fictionalized memoir about becoming custodian of his 8-year-old brother when their parents die. His ""What is the What? The Autobiography of Valentino Achak Deng"" another fiction-tweaked account this time about a Sudanese ""Lost Boy"" in Atlanta and the nonfiction book ""Zeitoun"" about a Syrian- American living in New Orleans during and after Katrina are tremendous works of empathy. And ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is about empathy. Max must work to figure out the souls who make him king Carol and KW Ira and Judith Douglas and Alexander. This unique herd of massive puppets is enhanced with digital effects. But their sulky or wisecracking arrogant or doubting personalities come to life because of the terrific voice work of James Gandolfini Lauren Ambrose Catherine OHara Forest Whitaker Chris Cooper and Michael Berry Jr. ""Where the Wild Things Are "" doesnt unfold with the overly obvious rhythms of so many kid flicks. But Maxs time amid the oversized beings with their outsized sometimes spiky egos is definitely a heros quest. His prize that most elusive of grails the self.

Matt Nettheim/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption An illustration from ""Where the Wild Things Are"" by Maurice Sendak. A film based on the beloved childrens book opens Friday directed by Spike Jonze. Robert Harbison/The Christian Science Monitor/File          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Maurice Sendaks 1963 childrens classic ""Where the Wild Things Are"" contains exactly 10 sentences - 338 words of text - and 18 pictures. Not exactly major movie material you might say except that a major moviemaker Spike Jonze almost pulls it off.Judged strictly as a story the long-awaited film that Jonze and coscreenwriter Dave Eggers have crafted lacks vroom and bite. Children especially love a good story and watching this mood piece movie they may get antsy early.But Jonze should not be judged by ordinary standards. He is after all the director of ""Being John Malkovich"" a movie-within-a-movie-within-a-conundrum and ""Adaptation"" which was about the impossibility of concocting a coherent story line. (Both were written by Charlie Kaufman.) In ""Where the Wild Things Are"" Jonze is taking a large risk. Without benefit of a strong narrative he is trying to capture the propulsive fascinations of childhood fantasies. (The great Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki tries more entrancingly for the same thing.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Nine-year-old Max (played by the marvelous Max Records) is a lively kid but lonely. His older sister has no time for him and his single mom (Catherine Keener) is loving but harried. Standing atop the kitchen table at dinner time in his white wolf costume Max announces ""Woman feed me"" This is not a good way to go and pretty soon a fight erupts that propels Max still in his costume onto the open sea in a skiff under a full moon. His unplanned destination an island inhabited by 9-foot creatures - clawed hairy Wild Things who like to bang around the forests knocking down everything in sight. Max somehow convinces them hes a king their king and thus conveniently avoids being eaten by them. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Where the Wild Things Are The creatures brought to life through a combination of live action puppetry and CGI animation speak like ordinary mortals. The contrast between their fearsome features and their homespun delivery is offputtingly comic. Jonze is emphasizing the ways in which these Wild Things are emanations of Maxs equally wild id. The leader of the pack Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) is big and brawly on the outside but weak-willed on the inside. Judith (Catherine OHara) sports a large horn on her nose and always says exactly what she thinks. KW (Lauren Ambrose) Carols estranged girlfriend is the image of idealized motherhood. In one sequence she actually hides Max inside her tummy; he emerges covered in what looks like goopy amniotic fluid.Jonze in this movie is attempting to merge the fantastical with the realistic and his visual style as in the shots of Max and Carol traipsing in long shot across caramel-colored desertscapes is often minimalistic. He manages to make the Wild Things seem wholly believable. I never (well almost never) thought to myself ""That big galumphing puppet sounds just like James Gandolfini.""This blend of the real and unreal is successful because Jonzes feeling for childhood binds everything together. Even when particularly in the second half the film lurches from vignette to vignette I never wrote it off. Theres too much poignancy to Maxs plight. He is imagining (or is he?) a world totally unlike the one he has fled - a world he can control. And yet Max comes to realize that in growing up he cant control all the confusing madcap emotions coursing through him.Its a nice touch that the Wild Things as we discover dont entirely believe Max is a king. They want to believe it - which is almost the same thing. Max leaves the island chastened. Carol runs him down for being ""just a boy"" but when Max sails off the Wild Things gather on the shore and in a transcendent moment raise their voices in a ceremonial howl.I wish that Jonze had managed to transforms Maxs odyssey into more than a collection of glittering shards. He underrates ""traditional"" storytelling; or maybe hes just not very good at it. But there are some great rapturous moments in ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Jonze is humbled before the wonders of a childs imagination and so are we. Grade B+ (Rated PG for mild thematic elements some adventure action and brief language.)

Photo Some very good books were just never meant to be turned into movies. Sadly you can now add Maurice Sendaks 1963 classic ""Where the Wild Things Are"" to that list. Spike Jonze the immensely imaginative director of ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" has labored for many years with the best of intentions to turn Sendaks slim volume which contains only nine sentences of text over 37 pages into a full-length feature. On the plus side hes come up with a distinctive-looking hand-hewn movie that goes a long way toward capturing the visual magic of Sendaks drawings. At the same time in their overly earnest attempt to flesh Sendaks story out to 100 minutes Jonze and his co-screenwriter novelist Dave Eggers have laboriously spelled out motivations (divorce is bad) elaborated back stories -- and added reams of less-than-inspired dialogue. Unfortunately they havent supplied any kind of plot that would keep an adult like myself (who didnt grow up on the book) fully engaged. And I really wonder how kids will respond to a talky neurosis-driven movie thats this light on action. That would seem to leave an ideal audience of Williamsburg hipsters trying to get in touch with their inner childhoods. Maybe they will like the insipid indie-rock soundtrack. The film starts promisingly (and with minimal dialogue) with 9-year-old Max (an adept performer allegedly named Max Records) being attacked in his snow fort while his older sister fails to come to his rescue. The feral Max trashes her room and responds with even more rage when he catches his overwhelmed single mom (Catherine Keener) snuggling with her boyfriend (the barely seen Mark Ruffalo). Max dons a white wolf suit and bites his shocked mother. In Sendaks book Mom puts Max (who is only 5) to bed and he begins his magical journey in his sleep. Jonze has chosen to eschew animation (there is some subtle CGI) in favor of a more realistic approach with an angry Max running off and sailing to a magical land (actually Australia). There he encounters the Wild Things which in this version are played by Henson puppeteers in 9-foot-high animatronic suits closely modeled on Sendaks drawings. I have no quarrel with this approach so far. But the creatures are less Sendaks Wild Things than totally unscary Mild Things. They sound very much like a commune of kvetchy old hippies who argue endlessly among themselves while committing random acts of childish pique. The nominal leader of the pack Carol is ineffectual and self-doubting so the Wild Things embrace Maxs claim that hes a king. Its fun for a while when Max joins them in throwing clods of dirt at each other. (Dont try this at home kids.) When the Wild Things resume their bickering its not only the audience who grows restless. Unfortunately 90 minutes have elapsed before Max like Dorothy before him finally realizes ""theres no place like home."" Among those providing voices for the Wild Things (not always in perfect sync with the puppets) are Catherine OHara Forest Whitaker Lauren Ambrose and Chris Cooper. Carol is voiced by James Gandolfini an unfortunate choice whose distinctive nasal New Jersey whine kept making me wonder if (hope that?) Tony Soprano was going to pop out of the costume and whack the somewhat annoying Max. So fuhgeddabout ""Where the Wild Things Are""? No but brace yourself for a noble failure.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Where the Wild Things Are Fantasy. Starring Max Records James Gandolfini and Catherine Keener. Directed by Spike Jonze. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres something to be said for a childrens fantasy in which a child travels to a foreign land - and finds that the creatures there are even more miserable than he is. Spike Jonzes ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is not the usual adaptation of a childrens classic and he and screenwriter Dave Eggers deserve credit for creating a somber film with an indie-cinema feel. The results are mixed. Sometimes the multifaceted characters and the stray unexpected moments of existential longing make up for the movies overall tepid atmosphere. Sometimes they dont. The most daring thing that Jonze and Eggers have done is make a childrens film that might not really be for kids. It feels more like an adult comment on a childrens film a sober rumination on the genre that invites the audience to watch the action almost as though it were under glass. The soundtrack a mix of faux 60s pop and a lonely echoing acoustic guitar encourages viewers to step back and watch the story as though it happened long ago or were emblematic of something. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is audacious in its refusal to be reassuring which makes it hard to love but also hard to dismiss. We begin in the real world with a lonely hypersensitive boy Max (Max Records) living in a house with his divorced mom (Catherine Keener) and sister. Jonze employs a constantly moving camera and quick cuts for these early scenes lending them an unexpected documentary look. Thats not bad but whats disconcerting is that he doesnt switch styles later after the boy having run away from home arrives on the island where the Wild Things live. Jonzes style makes the island scenes seem more like a ""making of"" documentary than a fantasy though eventually viewers will adjust. Photo Warner Bros.

Pictures Review Wild Things kind of tepid 1 / 6 Back to Gallery At first the Wild Things want to eat Max which might have been interesting. But after Max tells an elaborate lie - that he is a king and that he can guarantee them happiness (theyre a very forlorn lot) - he experiences an elevation in status. It should be said that Max is not the most appealing kid. Like the music the performance by Max Records could be construed as an intentional distancing device. We watch him at a remove not engaging with his pain not rejoicing in his resourcefulness and not particularly worried about whether hell get eaten. Hes just a generic borderline obnoxious human boy surrounded by gigantic big-headed creatures. Though the movie drags for most of its running time the idea of these poor beasts leading unrewarding lives is a compelling one. We see them taking creature comfort in sleeping all together in a pile. And we see the nuances of doubt and anguish on their faces through beautifully rendered CGI effects. Carol voiced by James Gandolfini is an impressive creation a large ungainly creature with great artistic and spiritual longings and no outlet for them. He is almost an artist but he cant express it and almost a lover but his emotional imbalance and tendency toward violence make it impossible for him to forge a relationship. Yes were talking about a hairy 10-foot-tall creature - a costume combined with a CGI face and matched to an actors voice. But theres something going on with this character something serious about a personality doomed always to destroy the happiness he longs for. In a review good moments are more interesting to write about than dull moments and so a critic can easily give in to the temptation to make a movie seem better than it is. I loved for example the detail in the goatlike creatures face (voiced by Paul Dano) its long-suffering intelligence; and occasionally the utter sadness of the Wild Things and their world cracks through Jonzes under-glass approach and becomes very present. Yet it would be wrong to get caught up in this movies arresting fragments and ignore what seems plain that ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is not a success - that its too cold too dull too documentary-like and too long. All the same the good things in it are better than good and those willing to sit for them - and sift for them - wont go unrewarded.

"Where the Wild Things Are A joy for any age | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentWhere the Wild Things Are A joy for any age""Will you keep out all the sadness?"" a mild feral thing asks in Where the Wild Things Are  Spike Jonzes imperfectly perfect screen adaptation of the classic bedtime story.Image from the movie Where the Wild Things Are. Puppets are spreading to other performance genres and Canada is quickly becoming a hotbed for art puppetry.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 16 20093.5 stars (out of 4)Starring Max Records Catherine Keener James Gandolfini Catherine OHara Lauren Ambrose Chris Cooper and Forest Whitaker. Directed by Spike Jonze. 101 minutes. At major theatres. PG""Will you keep out all the sadness?"" a mild feral thing asks in Where the Wild Things Are Spike Jonzes imperfectly perfect screen adaptation of the classic bedtime story.An adult would know the ""correct"" answer to that question which the movie brilliantly explores although the child in all of us wants it not to be so. Article Continued BelowThe kid to whom the heartfelt query is addressed a boisterous 9-year-old named Max is likewise resisting the rising tide of maturity. He just wants to have a ""wild rumpus"" with his strange new woodland pals who have crowned him king of their dusty jungle. Reality can wait if only for a moment.The key to appreciating Where the Wild Things Are is in this statement by director Jonze ""I didnt set out to make a childrens movie; I set out to make a movie about childhood.""Its worth bearing in mind if youre intending to take a very young tot to see this film. What Jonze and screenwriter Dave Eggers have wrought in adapting Maurice Sendaks 1963 picture book perennial is something so primal and so in touch with the rough ""id"" of youthful fantasy it would be easy to dismiss as a simple kids story.And a primitive one at that. Where the Wild Things Are uses puppets instead of computers (although CGI rendering was needed for facial expressions) a sailboat instead of a rocket ship and dirt clods instead of guns or bombs. Its the antithesis of modern kidpix which seem to require all manner of digital hokum and gee-willikers 3-D eyestrain to be fully worthy of infantile attention. This movie makes a virtue out of minimalism and of intention rather than action and as a result it may appeal more to nostalgic parents than to their restless offspring.But its a joy for thinking moviegoers of any age. It doesnt seek to ""keep out all the sadness"" yet neither does it wallow in gloom. Instead it presents childhood as a journey filled with things both wonderful and fearful and ultimately all of the mind.A lot of credit for this must go to the marvellous Max Records just 12 years old (and age 10 and 11 when he started making this) who anchors the film with his completely natural portrayal of the adventurous protagonist Max. Hes in almost every frame of the film yet he never mugs for the camera or wears out his welcome. He is quite literally a force of nature dressed in a wolf costume that makes him look like an escapee from a school stage production of Winnie the Pooh.Acres of copy have been written about the difficulties Jonze had in persuading Warner Bros. to make Where the Wild Things Are his own obtuse way. He wanted to use tactile puppets rather than ethereal digits to render Sendaks brilliantly drawn vision of creatures that are more fearful than ferocious and more lost than truly wild. Jonze was right although you can see why the studio balked at first. The giant forest creatures voiced by James Gandolfini Catherine OHara Lauren Ambrose Chris Cooper Forest Whitaker and Paul Dano are so handmade and primal they come as a shock to the system. Is this some kind of joke?Then you realize - which in my case took a second viewing - that weve become so accustomed to digital doohickery we dont know what to make of something tangibly real. When these creatures knock each other about you actually see the fur fly and the dust rise. When someone or something is hit by a dirt clod in the contest organized by Max to keep sadness at bay they actually react in pain and cry out. Jonze and Eggers are highly cerebral and ultra-cool hepcats one celebrated for his innovative films (Adaptation Being John Malkovich) and the other for a zeitgeist-rattling memoir (A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius). Yet both have wisely resisted any temptation to turn Sendaks slim book into some kind of smug ironic atrocity. They approach childhood straight on remembering their own boyhoods of chasing dogs arguing with annoying sisters and moms and throwing dirt clods at both real and imaginary foes. Theyve taken a tale that can be read in the time it takes to check under the bed for monsters and fleshed it out with a back story about Max being the lonely son of a single mother (Catherine Keener) who rebels by grabbing a neighbours sailboat and heading to points and creatures unknown - which in reality may be no further than the door of his bedroom and the limits of his vivid imagination.Jonze and Eggers have given the wild things names and personalities from the sulky and jealous Carol (Gandolfini) to the snippy Judith (OHara) to the nurturing KW (Ambrose). They could have gone further - the rest of the characters are barely differentiated and the narrative occasionally creaks from lack of momentum. The ethereal soundtrack by Yeah Yeah Yeahs frontwoman Karen O and Coen Bros. regular Carter Burwell perfectly sets the mood.""Youre out of control"" various characters shout. Fortunately the movie never is. It keeps us firmly in its grasp taking us to the land where childhood forever roams and rages.The trailer of Where the Wild Things Are and other films at thestar.com/moviesThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Pictures Lets get this rumpus started Carol left voiced by James Gandolfini and Max (Max Records) explore their island world. ABOUT THE MOVIEWhere the Wild Things Are   1/2 (out of four) Stars Max Records Catherine Keener Mark Ruffalo James Gandolfini Lauren Ambrose Forest Whitaker Chris CooperDirectorSpike JonzeDistributorWarner Bros.Rating PG for mild thematic elements and brief languageRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Movies dont often allow unruly children a full palette of emotions. In Where the Wild things Are a confusing jumble of feelings course through 9-year-old Max making for a movie of surprising depth poignancy and energy. He may rush headlong in his wolf costume howling and leaping about but Max is not just a wild child. He is creative empathic and alienated. MORE Spike Jonze sails into the Wild RED CARPET REPORT See who showed up for the premiere Its a pleasure to see director Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) in collaboration with screenwriter Dave Eggers (Away We Go) take Max seriously. Purist fans of Maurice Sendaks classic childrens book will have to set aside expectations to fully embrace the film version. But they should embrace it. Though it certainly honors the book the film uses it mostly as a jumping-off point for a story about childhood in all its complexities. In Sendaks story disobedient Max is sent to bed without supper and the author creates an alternate universe in which the child escapes to a wilderness inhabited by ferocious but lovable creatures that make him their king. In the movie we see what prompts Max to pitch a fit and we feel for him. He is crushed when his teenage sisters friends trample his homemade igloo sanctuary. He feels cast aside when his single mother works long hours and gets distracted by a suitor. Eggers has said he and Jonze wanted to avoid depicting Max as so many movie kids are shown ""de-fanged."" Max certainly has fangs -- and hes not afraid to use them. The uneven pacing and tone are stirring blending melancholy with boisterous fun. When you think about it those polarities best capture the most indelible images of anyones childhood -- those which hurt or frighten and those which thrill. Following his tantrum Max storms off sets sail in a tiny boat and lands on the island with the odd-looking rampaging beasts. He befriends them and they prove to be as endearing funny and sometimes gloomy as Max himself. Still clad in his increasingly bedraggled wolf suit he incites riotous fun. Visually the 91/2-foot-tall Wild Things are a seamless blend of giant puppets and computer-generated images. Jonzes handheld style lends an intriguing immediacy to the dreamscapes. Like the book the movie blends a primitive quality with an imaginative artfulness. It also amplifies upon the storys gentle sly wit. Where the Wild Things Are is a fiercely innovative film with surprising texture and nuance. It captures the joy and exuberance of childhood without shying away from its very real pains and woes.

Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Oct. 16 2009 1201 a.m. ET ""Where the Wild Things Are"" honors the book in every imaginable way and in ways no one could have imagined until Spike Jonze and his collaborators came along. Maurice Sendaks beloved classic of childrens literature a tale told in mysteriously droll illustrations and 338 words has grown into a movie that feels vast in scope yet remarkably intimate and tender. And little Max the willful kid in the wolf suit has found his flawless embodiment in a boy whose real name happens to be Max Records. Like the hero of the book this Max projects a fantasy world from his yearnings fears and anger. But the movie invests those projections with such intense and genuine wildness as to make their creator a veritable Wizard of Id. The filmmaker Mr. Jonze has done only two features until now ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."" Both were strikingly original marvelously intricate and notably erratic in their plot and structure. They made him an exciting choice to direct this one though also a risky choice since the Sendak book is essentially plotless. (Boy misbehaves boys unseen mother sends him to bed without supper boys room becomes a forest populated by bizarre creatures who make him king and do his bidding until he feels hungry for love and heads back home.) Happily--and improbably given the potential for outraging whole generations of readers--the risks have been managed by taking greater risks and some brave ones. This adaptation by the director and his celebrated co-writer Dave Eggers makes Max a somewhat older (maybe 8 or 9) and much angrier child than the original--all that wildness doesnt come from nowhere--as well as a wrenchingly vulnerable child whose adventures are elaborately rooted in his everyday life. His mother is not only seen but powerfully felt Catherine Keener an actress of unforced warmth and uncommon humor has never been so affecting even when this loving mom vents ample anger in her turn. (Mark Ruffalo appears briefly as her boyfriend.) After establishing Maxs sensitivity and loneliness with a few deft strokes the movie makes him a more active protagonist than the boy of the book. Instead of staying in his room until the wild things appear he runs boats struggles to stay afloat during a terrifying storm sinks swims and finally marches up the beach of his subconscious with a heedless resolve thats perfectly reflective of his hurt and anger and guaranteed to get him into unmanageable trouble. ENLARGE Where the Wild Things Are Warner Bros. Pictures I have no idea how Mr. Jonze elicited the performance we see on the screen. Directors often trick cajole surprise bribe or badger child actors into doing what they want them to do but you have no sense of that here. Theres a nearly eerie purity to Max Recordss responses whether his alter Max is impressing monsters in his grandiosity mode (""I have power from another land. From ancient times. Dont make me show you.""); choosing up sides in a wild rumpus to come (""Ill be on my own side. By myself.""); screeching an order for the rumpus to begin (what a charming old word that is and what a grand screech the kid gives); smiling a smile of serene pleasure from the cozy bottom of a monster pile (the movie captures the childhood magic of safely enveloping spaces) or as his pretend power comes up against the reality of dream logic and warring factions emerge trying to solve the problem thats blighting his young life ""How do I make everyone OK ?"" The truth of course is that he cant. He cant make his mother happy cant fix whatevers wrong with his family cant bring back his absent father (who has given him the world in the form of a plastic globe) cant comprehend the conflicts of that world until he gets older cant be someone he is not. To bring him to an understanding of who he is--his fully sufficient and much-loved self--the movie dramatizes the books psychological subtext with an assortment of wild things that leap from the Sendak designs into joyous boisterous life. And the marvels they represent dont stop at the techniques--live action animatronics digital animation--that set them in motion. Theyre given voice by a superb cast that includes James Gandolfini Lauren Ambrose Forest Whitaker Catherine OHara Chris Cooper and Paul Dano. The wild things represent an unavoidable risk since theyre obliged to evoke the creatures of a book that is by now almost half a century old. Will todays media-saturated kids look on them as quaint imitations of monsters theyve known if not loved on the big screen and TV? That remains to be seen. What seems certain is that the physical and vocal music of the wild things--the glorious music on the sound track was written by Karen O and Carter Burwell--will strike a deep chord with filmgoers whove read the book to their children or who remember having had it read to them. (As I write this I can almost hear across the decades a chorus of parents including me acting out the run-on sentences with reassuring silliness ""The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and...."") Of the risks taken electively the most conspicuous is a rebirth scene thats closer to Jung than Sendak (notwithstanding the authors debt to psychoanalytic wisdom); while some may scoff I found the scene shockingly beautiful. But then the boldest risk was expanding on Maurice Sendak in the first place and it pays off handsomely--not only with the emotional resonance of such wish-fulfilling inventions as good and bad mother figures and a father figure who swings from loving to disparaging and back to loving in the end but with such gentle touches as Maxs secret anxiety about the health of the sun which his teacher tells the class will eventually go dark. A few sequences are dark too while a very few others may frighten young children (or not; its hard to overestimate how blase some kids have become). For the most part however ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is suffused with the glow of Lance Acords cinematography and with the brightness of Casey Storms costumes K.K. Barretts production design (never has so much been owed to so many twigs) and Spike Jonzes ever-graceful direction. As wish-fulfillments go this is a movie lovers dream. New York I Love You Its always remarkable when a film turns out well. Occasionally the same proves true of a film that turns out badly. ""New York I Love You"" is one of those occasions. The ingredients of its failure may not be distinctive. Many movies are burdened by clumsy acting slack direction dumb situations clanking cliches and listless writing. This film though an interlocking series of chance encounters with ironic twists involves 11 directors a few of them distinguished; 21 credited writers and at least 15 excellent actors. (To protect the innocent Im naming no names and making no comparisons to ""Paris je taime"" which was a mixed bag but an intriguing one.) Whats remarkable here is the consistency of the mediocrity the uniform fraudulence of the minipremises the reliable awkwardness of such almost-English lines as ""Your eyes would suffice to give tired men hope."" An actress weve admired is done in by her New York accent. A high school boy takes a girl in a wheelchair to a prom with foolish consequences. One woman says to another ""The citys full of surprises isnt it"" but the city of the film isnt; its full of banalities. For a while I thought ""New York I Love You"" was about insufferable cab drivers but everyones insufferable because everyone is afflicted with mock poetry. Logic dictates that the common denominator the governing insensibility is the producer but the credits list 19 producers. Ill name none of their names either since theres no reliable way to finger the guilty. To find out who perpetrated which vignette you can see the movie for yourself or check it out by logging on to the Internet Movie Database. I would strongly suggest the latter. DVD Focus Lovely amp; Amazing (2002) ENLARGE Nicole Holofceners film concerns a mother and her three daughters all of them hobbled by among other things their obsession with how they look. Catherine Keener is the oldest sister Michelle a forlorn beauty thirty-something child and apprentice slattern whos drifting through life with a couple of kids and a soulless husband. Emily Mortimer is Elizabeth a lovely but insecure actress living under the merciless gaze of a smarmy but successful actor whos played by Dermot Mulroney. Raven Goodwin is Annie a black adoptee and Brenda Blethyn is the matriarch Jane fantasizing that shes beloved by the plastic surgeon whos doing her liposuction. Capote (2005) ENLARGE In Bennett Millers remarkable first feature about Truman Capote and the writing of ""In Cold Blood"" Philip Seymour Hoffman stars as the author approaching middle age and Catherine Keener plays his trusted childhood friend Nelle--the novelist Harper Lee (who in her turn fictionalized the young Truman Capote as Dill in ""To Kill a Mockingbird""). Ms. Keeners quiet austerity provides a counterbalance to Mr. Hoffmans brilliance. If Nelle is the earth Truman is the sky plus the Northern Lights. Dan Futterman based his script also a feature debut on the massive biography of the same name by Gerald Clarke. You Can Count on Me (2000) ENLARGE Kenneth Lonergans debut feature finds stirring urgency and lots of humor in the bonds of love between a young woman and her wayward brother. Mark Ruffalo is Terry whos been drifting for years since their parents died in an accident. After hitting on his girlfriend for bus fare Terry goes off to cadge more money from his sister Sammy (a luminous performance by Laura Linney) a single mother with a wistful eight-year-old son Rudy (Rory Culkin) and a stable job as a loan officer in a dinky bank. Matthew Broderick is enjoyable as the banks comically compulsive manager. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Find television listings at LocateTV.

"Where the Wild Things Are - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Maurice SendakMOVIE REVIEW Where the Wild Things AreThe adaptation of Maurice Sendaks book expands on the boorish Max -- to its detriment.October 16 2009|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC In Maurice Sendaks ""Where the Wild Things Are"" less -- 10 sentences 37 pages 338 words -- became more a much-loved childrens book thats sold more than 19 million copies worldwide 10 million in the U.S.In the new film version of Sendaks classic more -- admired director Spike Jonze smart co-screenwriter Dave Eggers top-flight actors including Chris Cooper James Gandolfini and Forest Whitaker and a budget estimated at 80 million to 100 million -- has paradoxically become less a precious self-indulgent cinematic fable that not everyone is going to love.The difficulty starts with how little the filmmakers had to work with. A feature-length narrative had to be teased out of a tale that fit nicely into an eight-minute animated short back in 1973. Left to their own devices in filling in the books blanks the filmmakers have come up with a misdirected pastiche that will please neither children nor their parents something so empty and misconceived it makes you glad youre an adult.To fill in those spaces ""Wild Things"" chose to make explicit what was implicit which means emphasizing and expanding the sullen and hostile brattiness of 9-year-old protagonist Max. Those qualities are of course present in the book -- its one of the reasons it was controversial on publication -- but blowing them up this way in effect turns the film into a sanctification and celebration of some of the most childish aspects of being a child.Thats a shame because Jonzes idea that the beasts should be portrayed by people inside enormous costumes designed to duplicate the Sendak wild things by the Jim Henson Creature Shop in effect hipster versions of NFL team mascots is a fine one. Up to a point. For once these beings open their computer-generated mouths a whole other set of problems arise.Before we get to those creatures however a healthy chunk of time is given over to Maxs back story. Played by young Max Records hes introduced tearing around the house in his trademark wolf suit and trying to pounce on his beleaguered dog. No its not an ad for Ritalin its business as usual for Max who has a weakness for resorting to violence when things dont go his way and then going all pouty when the uncaring world gets violent in return.This kind of behavior reaches its apex when Maxs divorced mom (Catherine Keener) brings her boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) home for dinner which puts stressed-out Max so out of sorts he bites her on the shoulder. Hard.Terrified at the mess hes gotten himself into Max runs away and magically ends up on an island (the film was shot its hard to say why on the southern tip of Australia). Here he meets six wild things each given a specific personality by the actor doing the voice.More or less (actually less) in charge is Carol (Gandolfini) while KW (Lauren Ambrose) is on the elusive side. Judith (Catherine OHara) is the voice of doom and gloom while her pal Ira (Whitaker) just wants to get along. The bird-like Douglas (Chris Cooper) likes to get things done while the goatish Alexander (Paul Dano) is as sensitive as a beast can be.The problem with this cast of characters is not so much their personalities but the way screenwriters Jonze and Eggers have turned them into neurotic adults with dysfunctional relationships. To hear them talk among themselves is to feel like youve stumbled onto a group therapy session involving unfunny refugees from an alternate universe Woody Allen movie. Its not a good feeling.Max does utter the books signature line ""Let the wild rumpus start"" but he spends a lot of his time not really being sure what hes doing.When Jonze told the New York Times Magazine ""Everything we did all the decisions we made were to try to capture the feeling of what it is to be 9"" hes telling the truth. Unfortunately in this case thats not a very interesting place to be.Although Max does inspire the wild things to build a remarkable structure his more lasting legacy is the chaos he causes with things like dirt-clod fights. He decides to leave the island not because as in the book he ""wanted to be where someone loved him best of all"" but because as far as can be determined hes caused some real damage and has no idea how to make things right.In two of his previous films ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" Jonze brought an appealingly offbeat sensibility to a pair of strong Charlie Kaufman scripts.When faced as a director with the rudderless screenplay he co-wrote with Eggers hes been powerless to energize it in any involving way. Sometimes you are better off with 10 sentences than tens of millions of dollars and this is one of those times.--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--Where the Wild Things AreMPAA rating PG for mild thematic elements some adventure action and brief language.Running time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRemembering Maurice Sendaks wild side onstageMay 8 2012Philadelphia Where Maurice Sendaks wild things live onMay 8 2012For love of Where the Wild Things Are director Spike...February 28 2010Critics Pick Where the Wild Things AreOctober 29 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTMaurice SendakBookCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-wild-things16-2009oct16,0,3795491.story",200,wherethewildthingsare13,wherethewildthingsare,latimes

The movie barrels out at you like a nine-year-old boy filled to bursting with joys fears and furies he cant articulate. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The boy is Max played by Max Records 12 in a vibrantly alive performance that is surely a high-water mark for child actors. Max is in a dark place called home where his divorced mother (the ever-superb Catherine Keener) is distracted by work and a new lover (Mark Ruffalo). Jumping on a table in the white wolf suit he wears like a second skin Max rears up like an animal. ""I hate you Ill eat you up"" Max yells at his mother biting her hard before bolting from home in search of an undiscovered island where wild creatures roam and play drives out pain. Or so Max thinks. Sendaks book consists of a mere 10 sentences. The challenge for Jonze and co-writer Dave Eggers (Away We Go) is to flesh out the tale to movie length. Jonze started by breaking rules (there would be no manageable Disney version of Max). From the moment he climbs into a tiny sailboat and heads out to sea (a departure from Sendak who had Maxs bedroom morph into the island) Max declares himself king of this wild world. How to film the noise inside Maxs head? The easy way would be to go the animation route. Not for Jonze. The director and his gifted team including hand-held-camera master Lance Acord traveled to rugged Australia and shot the action live with puppeteers inside nine-foot creature costumes. Per tradition the voice work was done by name actors. James Gandolfini excels as Carol the creature leader who Max discovers tearing down his home right after he builds it. Like Max Carol has commitment issues. Lauren Ambrose voices KW the redheaded loner. Chris Cooper takes on the beaked Douglas. Catherine OHara puts the sass into Judith who henpecks the loyal Ira (Forest Whitaker). And Paul Dano moans touchingly at being the shortest creature the goat-horned Alexander. Thats where tradition ends. Instead of recording each actor singly in a sound booth Jonze gathered them together encouraging howling and rabble-rousing. The spontaneity is infectious. Computers were used to create facial expressions for the creatures with the actors themselves as models. For all the money spent the films success is best measured by its simplicity and the purity of its innovation. Jonze has filmed a fantasy as if it were absolutely real allowing us to see the world as Max sees it full of beauty and terror. The brilliant songs by Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and the Kids enhance the films power to pull you in as Max literally hides in the belly of a beast builds a fort and issues a call to arms ""I know something that always cheers me up -- a war."" Jonze never belabors points about violence or the Freudian nature of identity and rebellion. Whether Maxs cheeks flush with euphoria or rage our identification with him is complete. Jonze brings all the senses into play. You can practically feel the animal heat when homesick Max falls asleep in a ""real pile"" of snoozing wild things. But the creatures dont coddle Max and the film follows suit. By staring without blinking into the yellow eyes of these wild things Max begins to recognize something of himself. Jonze doesnt blink either. Thats why this adaptation of Sendaks rigorously unsentimental story is a moving tribute to both their talents.

PicturesMax Records and a furry friend appear in Spike Jonzes ""Where the Wild Things Are"" an adaptation of Maurice Sendaks iconic childrens tale. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" Movie Review -- Maurice Sendak knew where the wild things were. They were inside everyone and sometimes they broke free. His 1963 picture book told the story of one such escape. It starred Max a little boy who sometimes acted like a perfect beast and had the wolf costume to prove it. But once he went too far and was sent to his room -- where he discovered a world of real wild things and was proclaimed king of them all. Where the Wild Things Are (PG) Warner Bros. (94 min.) Directed by Spike Jonze. With Max Records Catherine Keener. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING THREE STARS Ratings note The film contains a few scary monsters. This is ""Where the Wild Things Are"" and its a good choice for director Spike Jonze. A bit of a wild thing himself Jonze went from making skateboard shorts to making music videos (and coming up with ""Jackass"" stunts for MTV). His only two features are ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" neither of which are truly set in the real world and both of which are so original they almost give you headaches. So it was painful a while ago to read the hyperbolic internet reports that Jonzes new movie had terrified children in preview audiences and that the studio was considering taking over. And its a qualified pleasure now to say that the movie is not a disaster -- in fact parts of it are miraculous -- and that it is still very much a Spike Jonze movie. Its just also a little untamed itself. One thing the new ""Where the Wild Things Are"" does very well is capture the shifting moods of a grade-school boy. Not quite a small child still not a teenager Max is stuck unsteadily between the two. He is eager to play with the big kids yet quick to slide into tears determined to be independent yet still clinging to his mother and older sister. Another thing the film does thanks to Dave Eggers script is underline the parallels between Maxs real world and his monster island. The giant beasts he meets are jealous and quarrelsome and apt to erupt in tantrums -- and so Max realizes is he. They sometimes think no one pays attention to them or loves them -- and so Max realizes does he. Like the best childrens tales this is a trek toward knowing. Where ""The Wild Things"" falters unfortunately is well where the wild things are. In making this movie Jonze made two crucial decisions. One of course was to expand Sendaks spare book into a full-length feature story. The other was to eschew animation even the island sequences in favor of live action. Both choices are problematic and involve a lot of obvious padding both in the script (which now features endless monster rough-housing) and in the costumes (which feature unsung actors in enormous furry suits and giant heads). Neither serves the movie well. Providing the dubbed-in voices are a number of stars. The best known -- and by far most interesting choice -- is James Gandolfini as Carol Maxs best monster friend. Although its disconcerting to hear Tony Sopranos voice coming out of a giant furball its not that big a stretch. Like the mobster Carol is petulant and perpetually self-pitying. As Max young Max Records is a natural marvel his motives perfectly transparent and his moods constantly mobile. We see him and know exactly how he feels -- an identification Jonze emphasizes early on by bringing his camera down to Maxs level making sure that were literally seeing things from his point of view. Too bad then that the film starts to lose that point of view soon after we get to the island. Well done as the monsters are they never convince as monsters. Its too easy to remember theyre simply actors in giant monster suits. (Not even good suits either; the bird looks distressingly like some fast-food franchise mascot.) And their squabbles begin to bore. Despite those reports of early screenings I cant imagine many children running scared from the theater. I can however imagine quite a few asking to leave early. Childless Spike Jonze fans may find a lot here to like. But parents should be prepared for some squirming -- and smart ones will have prepared their tots by first reading Sendaks original wild tale.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Lets dispense with the preliminaries What do the experts think of ""Where the Wild Things Are? As the end credits rolled my 12-year-old daughter and her bestest friend turned to me with faces like the twin masks of comedy and tragedy on a Broadway playbill. One girls eyes were wet with tears of sadness and profound joy; ""I loved it she sighed. The other looked as if someone had stuck an egg-beater in her ear and scrambled her brains. ""That is not a childrens movie she growled.Theyre both right. In adapting Maurice Sendaks slender 1963 picture-book classic director Spike Jonze and writer Dave Eggers have teased out the melancholy along with the magic. While this much-awaited long-in-the-works film has more than its share of wild rumpuses its big shaggy heart is in what happens after the rumpus dies down insecurities misunderstandings fears. ""Where the Wild Things Are isnt for little kids so much as its about them and parents and tykes expecting the next ""Shrek or even a seamless work of Pixar genius will be sorely disappointed if not a little freaked out. The movie is a wild thing and thats not such a bad thing at all.In young Max Records - 9 when the film was shot three years ago - ""Wild Things has a Max whos much older than in the book but who still has the proper mix of angel face and Tasmanian devil (besides he looks great in wolf jammies). Were introduced to him as he and the camera both appear to be tumbling downstairs at top speed; the title is scratched on the emulsion in an ADD blurt. So far so good.Eggers a novelist and occasional voice of his generation has reset Sendaks tale in recognizable reality but he thankfully doesnt dwell on it. What we learn of Maxs life is overheard in snatches the way a child listens Dad is out of the picture mom (Catherine Keener) is stressed from work older sis (Pepita Emmerichs) has jerky friends Max is alone. A brief shot of mom smooching her new boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) is all the boy and the movie need to flip out.He dashes into the woods and ""Wild Things gracefully transitions from our world into Theirs. Max journeys by boat as in the book (no sea monsters sadly) and theres a frightening tumultuous nighttime beach landing. The film at this point feels genuinely dangerous wired to explode. The score by Karen O of the rock group Yeah Yeah Yeahs is acoustic but off-kilter It sounds like the ""Juno soundtrack with teeth. Then we meet the first Wild Thing. His name is Carol hes having a tantrum and he talks in the voice of Tony Soprano. Perfect. No really it works. James Gandolfini turns out to have exactly the rough-tough-creampuff vocal inflections a childs best beast needs. When Carol sulks (which is a lot) it carries weight and it breaks your heart because that voice is so evenly split between menace and the cuddles. Gandolfini gives a great awards-worthy performance and you never even see the man.The Wild Things themselves have been designed by Jim Hensons Creature Shop with extensive digital facework to give them full expressiveness. Theyre remarkable creations but you have to buy into the concept; if not - if youre feeling churlish or tired or unimaginative - theyll just seem like Muppets on steroids. Theres a giant rooster Thing named Douglas with Chris Coopers laconic voice; a lumbering couple kindly Ira (Forest Whitaker) and sharp-tongued Judith (Catherine OHara); Alex the insecure goatboy (Paul Dano); and K.W. (Lauren Ambrose) who has the unkempt hair and ""whatever attitude of a slacker tween.Max befriends them all and becomes their king - he talks them down from eating him with the timeless command ""BE STILL. It turns out they need a king or better still a parent. ""Where the Wild Things Are reimagines monsters as big top-heavy children; its one long unsupervised play-date fascinating to watch but a little wearing for all concerned. Jonze over-relies on handheld camerawork to convey the groups manic bursts of energy - building a huge bowerbird-nest of a fort (a wonderful visual) or engaging in a dirt-clod war - and the film too often gets the wobblies.There are inert patches too. As with any sugar high the crash is bound to come and entropy sets in sooner than we or Max would like. The filmmakers additions to Sendak - like a pair of captured owls who speak in squawk-talk that only some of the characters understand - are more eerie than enchanting and Carol starts losing his temper for real. Here at last is the problem with adapting picture-book classics Everything implicit in the drawings is forced to become explicit onscreen.The original ""Where the Wild Things Are is a parable about self-control for very young children - about the joys and dangers of letting fantasy run free and about learning for oneself when to rein it in. Jonzes film (to which Sendak has given his blessing) visualizes the process of learning control and its keynote is anxiety - the characters see and are saddened by the gap between whats broken and how little we can do to fix it. Told the owls will answer only seven-word questions Max asks ""How do I make everyone O-K? and the answer is an undecipherable squawk that means Figure it out for yourself kid.Because Max is a boy and not a Wild Thing we have faith he will. The moral is tucked away where you cant see it but its there. By this point you may have realized that this version of ""Where the Wilds Things Are isnt about childhood at all but about childhoods end and whats gained and lost by it. Thats why very young kids dull Disney princesses overprotective parents and self-serious grown-ups should probably stay away while the college students after the screening I was at gathered outside and talked in low exultant voices. Thats why the 12-year-old next to me wept For everything from which she had so recently sailed away. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Or the panel with the Wild Things and Max howling and dancing beneath a big fat moon. Or Max in his bedroom sent there without his supper watching as a forest emerges all around.Its the stuff of dreams - vivid beautiful scary dreams - and youd be a fool to want to mess with it.Happily Spike Jonze the director of a pair of nutball expeditions into the land of the subconscious - Being John Malkovich and Adaptation - is that fool. With Sendaks blessing and with the aid of writer Dave Eggers who teamed on the screenplay Jonze has transformed the iconic picture book into a satisfyingly moody melancholy madcap live-action romp.Intense and a little insane Jonzes Where the Wild Things Are doesnt pad the books bare-bones plot. Max (played with fierce conviction by Max Records) is still the brat who stands on the dining table defiant and unruly. He still takes a little sailboat to wherever it is the Wild Things live - an island of woods and rocky shores (the picture was shot in South Australia). And the WTs themselves are still mysterious horned behemoths. (The costumes designed by Jim Hensons Creature Shop are scruffily amazing.)But now they have names and recognizable voices. Yup thats Tony Soprano - OK James Gandolfini - harrumphing around as the dude called Carol. And Catherine OHara gives voice to the flipped-out Judith a woolly thing wracked with hurt feelings.The prologue with Max amok in his moms house (Catherine Keener is the mother) is more elaborate Theres a glimpse of a boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) and a teenage sister with no patience for her weirdo sib.But then Max is off and running in an altogether different universe punching holes in twiggy makeshift huts building an elaborate fort hurling mud clods in an epic free-for-all consorting and cavorting with furry gargantuans with names that sound like they belong in a Miami retirement home. (Yes theres an Ira.)Jonze and company have decided that the Wild Things represent emotions gone mad rage jealousy loneliness elation sorrow. And sometimes because of that Where the Wild Things Are can feel like a cinematic study of manic-depression full-tilt mood swings in a gravity-defying arc.Where the Wild Things Are is scary and alarming in parts and younger viewers may be overwhelmed. Sometimes it feels loose disjointed stopped in its tracks - as if the filmmakers too needed to stop their ferocious imaginary play and take a breath weary from the squawking the whooping the scrums.Unlike the book the movie is no masterpiece but its a brave and oft-times transcendent endeavor.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Spike Jonze has recently said in interviews that his chief goal in adapting Maurice Sendaks Where The Wild Things Are was to try to capture the feeling of being 9. By that measure--by just about any measure really--he succeeded wildly. The big hurdle was spinning a beloved essentially plot-free 300-word childrens book into a feature-length movie but Jonze--along with co-scripter Dave Eggers who knows a thing or two about the trials of childhood--managed to remain faithful to Sendaks sentiment and visuals while expanding their scope. The movie leaps from the gate careening through the emotional peaks and valleys of a 9-year-olds mind--newcomer Max Records plays Max in a serendipitous coincidence--but never succumbing to cutesy kid-movie tropes. In a breathless early scene Max engages his sisters friends in a snowball fight rushing from ecstasy to rage in a second from a sense of belonging to the sense of total isolation peculiar to children. Those feelings quickly drive Max to where the wild things are; the real world provides short bookends to a movie that lives mostly inside Maxs head. And what an expansive wondrous confusing scary and gorgeous place to be with lush woods abutting endless deserts and a raging ocean. If those cues arent direct enough the wild things themselves evoke various sides of Maxs personality. (The creatures are brought to life by costumes with CG-augmented faces and they look great.) He first meets Carol (voiced by James Gandolfini) whos busy crushing everything in sight. No wonder the two become fast friends Max can relate to Carols insecurity his need to be loved his temper and his sweetness. Though little happens it doesnt much need to. Max gets to know the wild things in ways that simply ring true and thats story enough. He favors Gandolfini all but ignores the timid goat-beast voiced by Paul Dano tries to impress big-sister figure Lauren Ambrose and bosses around Chris Coopers bird-man. And in a subtle daring but thoroughly effective move Jonze has Max fearfully avoid the nameless near-silent bull who often appears alone and in the distance unremarked upon. Whether the action is grand and exciting as when Jonze brings to life a massive fortress made of twigs or simple and human as in touching one-on-ones that Max has with Ambrose Dano and Gandolfini it all feels genuine to the actual experience of childhood in ways that childrens movies generally dont. Max learns about himself to be sure but Jonze never considers making the sort of broad-stroke ""Heres what everybody learned"" gestures that attempt to stand in for actual emotion. Instead he lets a little kid loose to explore the terrain of his own mind which turns out to be an amazing place.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 15 2009 212 PM Where the Mildly Depressed Things Are Spike Jonzes adaptation of the Sendak classic has too many mopey monsters not enough Max. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Where The Wild Things Are come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion of Spike Jonzes adaptation of this childrens classic You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Where the Wild Things Are Im trying to get to the bottom of my animus toward Where the Wild Things Are (Warner Bros. Pictures) Spike Jonzes adaptation of the classic childrens picture book by Maurice Sendak. It may require some time on the couch. When I learned--at the first rumblings of the slow-mounting wave of hype thats been preceding this movie for years now--that Wild Things was destined for the multiplex I felt a chill of dread. The precedent for big-screen adaptations of mid-20th-century golden-age childrens books--Dr. Seuss E.B. White--wasnt promising. There were two bad roads the Wild Things movie could potentially go down the Cat in the Hat road (a grievous debasement of the source text with a big-name comedian in latex makeup delivering some awful slangy ""updating"" of Seussian language) or the Charlottes Web road (a literary adaptation in the decorous mode respectful of the original but sentimentalized and bland). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. To its credit this Where the Wild ThingsAre steers far clear of both these approaches. Its a childrens book adaptation of a sort that hasnt been tried before. Spike Jonze the wunderkind music-video director who made Being John Malkovichand Adaptation chose to use the book as a springboard for an idiosyncratic deeply personal film that would be (to paraphrase a rave review given to Sendaks book in Life in 1967) not so much for children or even about them as by a child. The script by novelist and memoirist Dave Eggers neither riffs on the book nor reproduces it. Rather Eggers imagines another longer story in the interstices of the 37-page original (a story that now actually exists in book form with the publication of Eggers 285-page fake-fur-bound ""novelization"" The Wild Things.)Jonze and Eggers approach to the book is both original and well-intentioned; its clear that they take both Sendak and childhood seriously (though not as seriously as they take themselves). Its just too bad the end result isnt a better movie. Advertisement If youve either had a child or been one in the past 40 years you already know the story of Where the Wild Things Are. A little boy named Max puts on a wolf suit one night and misbehaves telling his mother ""ILL EAT YOU UP"" She sends him to bed without dinner and while he pouts his room magically transforms into a forest from which he sets sail to an island full of frightening beasts. He tames the creatures with a powerful stare becomes their king and plays with them until missing his mother he sails home again to find a hot dinner waiting for him in his room. The story is as elemental as it gets a dreamlike journey through the childlike psyche that takes place in the brief span of what parents these days call a ""time out."" Its that elemental compact quality that makes Where the Wild Things Are tough to adapt as a feature-length film (though it might have made a great 20-minute short). Where the Wild ThingsAre doesnt need to be glossed analyzed or expanded. Its just there like some perfectly formed natural monument or an Easter Island head. We know everything we need to know about Max and his mother from their one exchange of dialogue in the book ""His mother called him WILD THING and Max said ILL EAT YOU UP "" It adds nothing to know that Maxs mother (Catherine Keener perfect in a tiny role) is divorced with a boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) and financial worries. Or that Max (the remarkable Max Records who was only 9 at the time of filming) is angry at his teenage sister for destroying the igloo he built in the snow. Jonze tries to recreate the books in medias res beginning by opening the film on a series of abrupt cuts as Max races from room to room raising hell. The effect is bracing disorienting and terrific--but almost immediately that careening momentum is slowed by the need to provide a psychological back story for the boys misbehavior. Everybody in this movie gets a psychological back story including most drearily the wild things themselves. When Max arrives at the island his first encounter is with a beast having a tantrum analogous to his own Carol (a male beast despite the name voiced by James Gandolfini) is hurling himself around the creatures encampment demolishing the thatched huts his fellow wild things have constructed. Looking disapprovingly on Carols rampage is a menagerie of beasties whom I soon desisted from trying to keep straight Theres the cranky horn-nosed Judith (voice of Catherine OHara); big-nosed and sad-eyed Ira (Forest Whitaker); Alexander an introspective goat (Paul Dano); Douglas a peacemaking chicken (Chris Cooper); and the free-spirited K.W. a sort of girl-thing with long red hair (Lauren Ambrose). Let it be said that the wild things as physical beings--mixed creations of full-body puppetry studio voice work and digital manipulation--are absolute marvels. Any fear that they would have the sleek weightless depressingly synthetic look of all CGI characters not created by Pixar proves unfounded. These lurching beings with their droopy expressive faces and dirty matted fur feel as real and present as flesh-and-blood humans. The casting of household-name actors as the beasts can be distracting at times God bless James Gandolfini for trying but will he ever be able to escape Tony Soprano? Still all the voice actors do fine work especially Catherine OHara as the kvetching conniving Judith. The problem isnt the way the beasts look and sound; its what they say and do for the nearly 80 minutes of on-screen time they occupy. Jonze and Eggers are both gifted at engineering isolated moments of emotional intensity. When the wild things race through the forest to the sound of a Yeah Yeah Yeahs song or leap atop Max and one another in a great snuggly pile theres an undeniable rush of pleasure. (You can get it in its purest form by watching the trailer.) But in between these hits of energy are long swaths of desultory narrative about the relationships among the wild things themselves Judith is jealous of Carol because of his special closeness to Max. Carol is bummed that K.W. has made friends outside the wild-thing community. Alexander struggles with the self-esteem issues you might expect from a puny introverted goat. Essentially the entire middle section could be summed up as follows Fuzzy guys build a stick fort sit inside it and mope. If I avoid taking my 3-and-a-half-year-old daughter to this movie it wont be because the wild things would scare her. (They might frighten some children but I live with a miniature adrenaline junkie.) Itll be because their endless therapeutic workshopping would bore her stiff. At heart the original Where the Wild Things Are isnt about the wild things at all--the furry beasts are stand-ins for Maxs demons externalizations of his secret aggressions and fears. (In this spellbinding interview Sendak tells Bill Moyers that he drew the beasts based on the sense memory of his terrifying old Jewish relatives looming in for a kiss.) Assigning each wild thing his or her own demons and turning the story into a chronicle of the beasts power struggles and hurt feelings drains the energy out of the story we really care about Maxs journey to a mysterious place thats both outside and inside--and how he finds his way back home again.

(Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Friday October 16 2009 1227 PM Title Where the Wild Things Are A boy finds strange creatures on a mysterious island. With Max Records James Gandolfini. Director Spike Jonze. (134). PG Action. At area theaters. The terrific captivating film of Maurice Sendaks ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is unique among movies from childrens stories. Its thoughtful intimate and not just imaginative but also respectful of imagination. Most importantly this shaggily charming movie knows that kids oversized emotions are just as gripping as their wildness.Even when playing on his own nine-year-old Max (played by newcomer Max Records) causes quite a rumpus. After his older sisters pals smash his snow fort while his single mother (Catherine Keener) ignores him in favor of work and a new boyfriend Max acts out biting his mom and running away in his full-body wolf costume.At a waters edge he finds - in pure Sid amp; Marty Krofft fashion - a boat that takes him to a mysterious island where he befriends seven giant creatures who make him their king and embody all sides of Max though in freaky furry form Alexander (voiced by Paul Dano) is constantly left out; Judith (velvet-toned Catherine OHara) is bossy; KW (whispery Lauren Ambrose) is loving yet needy. And then theres unpredictable Carol (James Gandolfini sounding like he has a stuffy nose) who becomes like Maxs id the wild things wild thing.But controlling these monsters and keeping them free from hurt feelings is a lot for a boy in a wolf suit. Especially when his kingliness is fake while the damage they and he can do is very real.And speaking of real You cant take your eyes off the wild things. Though at first they resemble H.R. Pufnstuf the sophisticated puppetry that gives them scruffy surreal life -- theres minimal CGI used here -- makes them feel tactile and genuine. The voice performances especially from Gandolfini and OHara are pitch-perfect as is the tribal score from Carter Burwell and Karen O.If the script from director Spike Jonze and novelist Dave Eggers stumbles in its last third its because most of it so elegantly expands upon Sendaks 1963 classic. This could easily have been ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" or ""The Cat in the Hat"" had great care not been taken.Jonze (""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"") has said he wanted to make a movie about childhood not a childrens movie and so viewers under 6 may leave a bit more sad than ecstatic and parents should be aware theres no Glinda or Willy Wonka around to grant wishes. The conflicts Max and the wild things face are mostly left unresolved. But thats fine because the film treats kids inner lives as more than a fantasy which is a rare and beautiful thing.

"Where the Wild Things Are | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; where-the-wild-things-are ) Where the Wild Things Are (United States 2009) October 14 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Where the Wild Things Are may be the first family film in recent memory to rely not on narrative or character development but on ideas and the directors vision. The result is an involving experience for all but the most fidgety children and an opportunity for parents to enjoy (rather than endure) a motion picture with their offspring. For director Spike Jonze this represents a ""pet project"" and it turns out better than is often the case when a filmmaker is too close to the source material. There are problems but they are mostly minor and do little to detract from Where the Wild Things Ares effectiveness as a 2009 answer to The Wizard of Oz. Max (Max Records) is an incorrigible nine-year old. At times he can be sweet and endearing but he has moments when moodiness and a volcanic temper cause him to lash out at those close to him specifically his mother (Catherine Keener) and his older sister Claire (Pepita Emmerichs). One wintry day Max builds a snow fort. When a snowball fight with Claires friends gets out of hand and Maxs fort is destroyed he is thrown into a funk. Later when his mom ignores him in favor of chatting with a date (Mark Ruffalo in a cameo) he goes ballistic before running away from home. His destination like Dorothys is deep in his imagination. He ends up on an island populated by seven ""Wild Things"" each of which represents an element of his psyche. At their first meeting they appoint him king and Max faces the challenge of satisfying the difficult and often conflicting demands of his ""subjects."" In the process he learns about the hardships and rewards of being part of a family. The opening segments - those that precede Maxs escape into his imagination - are evocative and will likely strike a chord of familiarity with those who spent their childhoods in snowy climes. This part of the film is also important in establishing the aspects of Maxs mercurial personality since its helpful to see them integrated in his persona before meeting them as stand-alone entities. The first 10 (or so) minutes are concrete and well-grounded in reality (at least as seen from a nine-year olds perspective) and they exist in contrast to the majority of Where the Wild Things Are where events transpire on a lost fantasy island. The movies plot is minimal; its more about changes to Maxs worldview than anything physical. Much of what happens on the island concentrates on his interactions with the various creatures he encounters there. Its here that things tend to meander as the dramatic momentum flags. In adapting Maurice Sendaks illustrated book Jonze was forced to expand the canvas significantly and this leads to some narrative and pacing issues during the midsection. Dorothys journey along the Yellow Brick Road explores many of the same ideas with a tighter focus. Jonze also fashions a level of separation between Max and the audience creating situations in which the intellectual resonance is stronger than the emotional one. One doesnt feel invested in Maxs adventure in a way that would elevate this story to the high level achieved by the best childrens story adaptation of recent years A Bridge to Terabithia. The central relationship on the island is between Max and the giant Carol (whose voice is provided by James Gandolfini). Carol for lack of a better term represents Maxs soul a need for friendship and unconditional love coupled with the capacity for destruction. By coming to terms with Carol Max learns to understand himself and most importantly the trauma he has been causing his mother. Another important friendship develops between Max and the nurturing KW (voice of Lauren Ambrose) who represents the aspect of Max we see early in the movie when he curls up by his mothers feet. The creature design is an incredible feat of imagination evoking with near-flawless effectiveness the illustrations in Sendaks book. The Wild Things provide the impression of muppets and Big Bird (not surprising considering the involvement of Jim Hensons Creature Shop) but not in a cartoony way. They are the kinds of giant puppets that Sid and Marty Krofft would have used in H.R. Pufnstuf given the technology and budget. As ""cute"" as they sometimes appear they are capable of generating an aura of menace. When Carol becomes enraged theres nothing cuddly about him. The importance of getting the look of the Wild Things right should not be underestimated since the films success relies on this. Jonez and his team find the right balance between three-dimensional embodiments of the books creatures and entities that work in the context of a live-action motion picture. The only actor with significant screen time is relative newcomer Max Records whose only previous feature credit is a small part in The Brothers Bloom (he played Stephen as a boy). Records greatest strength is his incredibly expressive face. He conveys emotions through his expressions; his delivery of dialogue is less certain. It remains to be seen whether his career trajectory will lead him to become the next ""big"" child actor or whether hell perform on the periphery until puberty hits. Catherine Keener has a small role as Maxs mom and her confident presence in her few scenes makes us wish Jonze had found a way to expand her screen time. The vocal casting is perfect James Gandolfini as Carol Lauren Ambrose as KW Paul Dano as the goat Alexander; Catherine OHara as the perpetually negative Judith; Forest Whitaker as Judiths sadsack companion Ira; Chris Cooper as Douglas this films Big Bird; and Michael Berry Jr. as the taciturn Bull. Only Gandolfinis voice is immediately recognizable; everyone else blends anonymously into their parts and the Tony Soprano connection serves only to invest Carol with an extra edge. Where the Wild Things Are is Jonzes third feature length motion picture (he is probably still best known for his music videos). The sense of visual imagination one has come to expect based on Being John Malkovich and Adaptation (both written by Charlie Kaufman) is fulfilled here. This movie is nothing if not an embodiment of Jonzes flair and style. Most importantly it fulfills the 1 criterion of any family film it involves viewers of all ages on different levels. Children will react viscerally (both positively and negatively with delight and fear) to the creatures pre-teens and young teens will connect with Max and instinctively relate to his experiences and adults will recognize the allegorical nature of the experience and enjoy it for what it is. This is probably the best family film since Disneys Up and one of the most visually interesting pictures of the year. Whether or not its a big success during its theatrical run this is the kind of movie people will be watching for years to come at home.

Comments Where the Wild Things Are Recommended Free Watch on Amazon Rated PG  101 minutes  2009 For anyone who grew up with Maurice Sendaks magical 1963 picture book the idea of its slim story being pumped up into a live-action Hollywood feature must seem like a travesty. Director Spike Jonze (Adaptation) has translated it into a fairly beguiling screen experience though by the end of its 101 minutes I was definitely ready for bed. To his credit Jonze realizes Sendaks beasts not through digital animation but through old-fashioned animatronic costumes fashioned by Jim Hensons Creature Shop and they lumber around with agreeable solidity (given voice by such actors as James Gandolfini Catherine OHara Chris Cooper and Forest Whitaker). A realistic frame in which the young hero (Max Records) rails against his neglectful sister and divorced mother (Catherine Keener) is warmly and gently handled though the central story detailing the personal politics between him and the six childlike monsters steadily loses steam.

Just ask Peter Sellars the visionary stage director whose critically savaged recent Public Theater production of Othello -- with its postracial casting repurposed characters and a mumbling Philip Seymour Hoffman as Iago -- was considerably more compelling in theory than as a piece of stagecraft. Giving themselves no less formidable a challenge director Spike Jonze and novelist Dave Eggers set out to make a feature-length film version of Where the Wild Things Are Maurice Sendaks nearly wordless 1963 childrens book about Max a mischievous boy sent to bed without his supper whose id decamps for a mysterious island populated by the giant mischief-making beasties of the title. Some revisionist criticism (like Bruce Handys recent New York Times essay) notwithstanding Sendaks book remains to quote a sage colleague ""one of those perfect things"" -- a primal scream of sorts that whether you fully appreciate it at 6 or not until 60 captures with lyrical precision the impotent rage of a willful child in the face of parental authority. So perfect in fact that the very idea of a Wild Things movie which has been kicking around for more than a decade seemed from the start folly.As it happens Jonze and Eggers have added a lot without betraying a thing. Like Jonzes previous Adaptation and its freely associative relationship to Susan Orleans The Orchid Thief Where the Wild Things Are is another small miracle of literary adaptation which aims to capture the spirit rather than the letter of its source material. The movies Max (12-year-old newcomer Max Records who gives one of the most naturalistic child performances Ive ever seen in a movie) is now a child of divorce with a loving-but-harried single mom (Catherine Keener) and a teenage sister whod rather hang out with her cool older friends than pay attention to her dorky kid brother. Early in the film those bigger kids leave Max winded and teary-eyed after pummeling him in a driveway snowball fight -- a terrible horrible no good very bad day that only gets worse when Mom invites to dinner her new boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) the strange man glimpsed by Max from a cautious distance an obvious intruder into his domain. Whatever is a boy to do under such circumstances but don his beloved wolf costume and throw the mother of all temper tantrums? ""I didnt set out to make a childrens movie. I set out to make a movie about childhood"" Jonze says in the Where the Wild Things Are press notes. What hes ended up with strikes me as one of the most empathic and psychologically acute of all movies about childhood -- a Wizard of Oz for the dysfunctional-family era.Just as the characters of Jonzes Being John Malkovich slipped inside the skin of the erudite character actor Jonze and Eggers here climb into the head of a preteen boy at once frightened by the world around him and eager to master it. So Maxs solo boat ride to the isle of the wild things is markedly more perilous than Dorothys cyclone the landscape he finds there more rugged than enchanted. This parallel world (the inspired work of production designer K.K. Barrett and cinematographer Lance Acord) has all the weight and textures of the real one a reminder that so much of childrens make-believe begins with the transfiguration of ordinary objects -- a cardboard box that becomes a fort a tinfoil suit of armor. So too does Jonze who rose to prominence as a director of skateboard videos and the co-creator of MTVs Jackass remember well the terror and euphoria of boyhood tests of physical mettle making Where the Wild Things Are among other things a welcome salvo against the modern-day ""helicopter"" parents who prefer that their kids accrue cellulite in front of a TV rather than do anything by which ""they might get hurt."" The ""wild rumpus"" Max initiates upon being crowned king of the wild things is in Jonzes version a body-slamming smack down in which the creatures immolate their own nests (using their torsos as bulldozers) while a later dirt-clod battle (which recalls the epic sandlot war from Frank Borzages masterful 1934 No Greater Glory) leaves behind many bruised limbs and even more bruised egos -- this time with Max himself doing much of the bruising.The look of the wild things has been closely modeled on Sendaks original illustrations with high-tech CGI faces atop wonderfully low-fi fur and papier-mache bodies. But in by far their most audacious (and potentially disastrous) stroke Jonze and Eggers have given each of the creatures a name and a distinct personality -- even put words in their mouths. The horned horizontally striped beast featured prominently in the book has become Carol (voiced with disarming delicacy by James Gandolfini) a gentle giant at once Maxs disciple and alter ego. Straggly-haired KW (Lauren Ambrose) the object of Carols inarticulate affection is like Maxs sister a moody adolescent who strays from the group to spend time with her new best friends. Chronically gloomy griping Judith (Catherine OHara) accuses King Max of playing favorites especially when the film arrives at that most dreaded of schoolyard rituals -- picking teams for an athletic contest. So Max trades one dysfunctional family for another and before long finds himself in the position every child particularly those of divorce fears most being the one responsible for holding the family together. For a while Max placates everyone with the promise that his invisible ""sadness shield"" will guard them all from hurt feelings but even it proves ill-equipped to stop the onward march of time that is turning the world of the wild things -- and everything in it -- to dust.

""Its hard being a family"" says KW late in the film -- harder still being 9 or 10 and learning that parents are imperfect people that friendships are fleeting and that nothing lasts forever. Like Sendak before him Jonze seizes upon that uncertain moment and transforms it into art.WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE | Directed by SPIKE JONZE | Written by JONZE and DAVE EGGERS based on the book by MAURICE SENDAK | Produced by TOM HANKS GARY GOETZMAN JOHN CARLS SENDAK and VINCENT LANDAY | Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Truly I am madly deeply in love with the film version of ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Not since Robert Altman took on ""Popeye"" a generation ago and lost has a major director addressed such a well-loved all-ages title. This time everything works from tip to tail from the moment in the prologue at which director Spike Jonze freezes the action (Max fork in hand tearing after the family dog) to the final scenes hard-won reconnection between Max and his mother at the kitchen table. Warner Bros. Pictures should be applauded for such a nervy and breathtaking achievement -- the rare adaptation that goes deeper not dumber in its page-to-screen translation of a childrens classic. Not everyone will share my feelings. I suspect kids will go for it more than their parents; in my experience its parents who tend to get fussed up about material they perceive often wrongly as ""too dark"" or difficult. Theres a certain amount of pain in ""Where the Wild Things Are"" but its completely earned. The movie fills you with all sorts of feelings and I suspect children will recognize those feelings as their own. A movie such as Disney/Pixars ""Up"" (which I also love -- what are the odds of getting two such gems different as they are in the same year?) ensures mass-audience appeal of a certain economic impact by dint of its own canny approach to blockbuster machinery and some inspired reconfigurations of hardy formulas. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" is a different sort of great. Its take-it-or-leave-it great -- scruffier lower-key. Despite reports of nervous studio meddling it offers the same wealth of dream-catcher off-kilter magic as did Jonzes earlier features ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."" The film engages Maurice Sendaks 1963 storybook all of 338 words long in a cinematic conversation striking minor chords and plaintive emotions where other directors wouldve gone for the throat. On paper the additions to Sendaks skeletal story dont sound so good. Max played with a fine mixture of petulance and vulnerability by the very aptly named Max Records is shown early on coping with life in a household unsteadied by divorce. A snowball fight with his older sister and her friends takes a sad turn (though the sister isnt demonized or caricatured the way such supporting characters usually are on-screen). A distraught Max turns violent with his mother (Catherine Keener excellent). Instead of the jungle emerging from the magically changed confines of his bedroom as in Sendaks original Max runs away finds his boat and sets sail. He lands on an island where the Wild Things live and fight and wrestle with the same neighborhood-clique issues rousing games and hurt feelings Max deals with back home. How did Jonze and fellow screenwriter Dave Eggers do it? How did they manage to amplify such a simple story without falling into the expository traps sprung by the egregious live-action Dr. Seuss adaptations? Mainly they have taste and wit and trust on their side. The movie understands Max and the complicated inner lives of all kids. James Gandolfini provides the voice of Maxs main Thing named Carol whose temper and insecurities mirror Maxs own. Actors as rangy as Catherine OHara Forest Whitaker and Lauren Ambrose voicing Carols fellow creatures develop personalities of unusual detail and unexpected emotion. Jonze has cited the rough-hewn films of John Cassavetes as a key influence on this picture and when you hear the muttered conversations between the Wild Things or the breathless construction projects initiated by Max and Carol (""Well have a laboratory where we can build robots to do our work for us. ... Well have our own detective agency ..."") you know what hes talking about. Shot in and near Melbourne Australia against an array of rumpus-friendly landscapes the film parallels Maxs two worlds the one back home and the scarier one where anything goes. Its never easy negotiating family or friends as Max learns. Without a hint of didacticism Jonze and company teach their antihero in the wolf suit a lesson but not the sort of lesson Hollywood usually throws at an audience. This ones more elusive and allusive and magical. The magic can be as simple as the wet shiny nose on Carols face or as disarming as the monstrously large dog seen in a single long shot in a ""Little Prince""-like desert sequence wherein Max and Carol discuss their kingdom and whats to be done with it. The exuberant childlike songs by Karen O of the band Yeah Yeah Yeahs fold neatly into Carter Burwells score. I suppose I wish Jonze had found a way to keep the bedroom-transformation conceit found in Sendaks original. His movie wont be everyones ideal ""Wild Things."" Instead its something more valuable -- its his and his alone. Hats off to Warner Bros. Pictures for letting it happen.

Posted at 050000 PM in Reviews Comments This movie was so bad I am going to torch this DVD Posted by nick | March 13 2010 at 1154 PM This movie is the most terrible movie i have seen in the 12 years i have lived. I was reading another comment saying that all kids had anger management problems but the kid in this movie had to be mentally disturbed. I was suprised the dog didnt bite him in the face when the kid tackled him and I would have thought it was funny. I felt completely violated and disturbed after wathcing this movie and will probably need a nightlight in my room because i am for the first time ever scared of how bad this movie was. Im half expecting a wild thing to come in my house and eat me. This movie had no message and was utterly from begining to end pointless. Posted by nick | March 13 2010 at 1149 PM I hate to say it but this movie is horrible... Especially the camera work... Posted by Ryan | March 09 2010 at 0850 PM ""A movie such as Disney/Pixars ""Up"" (which I also love -- what are the odds of getting two such gems different as they are in the same year?)"" Pretty good actually given that Pixar seems to make an excellent gem every year almost without fail. You only need one more to get to two. I find it interesting that a movie based on a childrens book is generating this much discussion and I think its a good thing. I like that hollywood is finally taking risks with kids movies. Their is no law that says kids entertainment has to be mediocre. Nothing says it has to be loud mildly amusing colorful but ultimately shallow and forgettable. An art movie and childrens movie dont have to mutually exclusive. People forget that kids have emotions too and films that try to address those emotions honestly will resonate with them as much as it will with adults. Posted by Dave C. | November 21 2009 at 0921 AM the only thing that confuses me more than this movie is that so many people thought it was so good On a positive note the kid who did the lead-role did a great job and there were cool visual effects too Posted by Samantha K | October 26 2009 at 0257 AM I suspect there is a division that occurs when watching this film those who had a childhood that was not ""Disneyifed""--living in a place and time when kids actually could throw dirt clots at each other who played war king of the forest and got dirty tumbling down hills building forts setting up kingdoms with imperfect rulers. On the other side Disneyifed people live a santitized versionstructured activities much less fun with FAR less risk taking and emotions that rarely simmer above the surface. We lived imperfect lives there was a wealth of emotion and circumstances that defied an easy answer. TV and media did not play such a large role in our lives. We had no other outlet except play. It gave us the ability to try on different roles to feel power and strength to exhaust our anger work through emotion. We could be king of the forest and still trudge home in time for a hot supper. It saddens me that a movie the exemplfies the importance of play and imagination is so hotly debated. We have lost something so vital to human development. Posted by Laura | October 24 2009 at 0815 PM Ive seen it three times now and it keeps getting better. Structurally its a bit thin; it doesnt have the fullness---the sustained visual and emotional lift--of ""the Black Stallion"" (an obvious reference point). But as you say this is Spike Jonezs picture from beginning to end--he sets a tone and controls it. Simply as craftsmanship it is a fine piece of work. Id advise the naysayers to look at the cinematography (as I did the second time). The play of light and shadow even in brighter scenes shows a real visual intelligence at work. Id also advise them to listen to the musical score (which is what I did the third time)---not just the actual music but how its subtly woven into the story. The quiet piano work is what allows the emotions to come through just as Michael Giacchinos delicate score did for the montage in ""Up"". And what a comment on our times that a simple series of non-verbal close-ups between mother and son at the end leaves audiences baffled. No doubt the ending of Chaplins ""City Lights"" would seem appropriately underwhelming too. To paraphrase Alfred E. Newman ""What no hype""? BTW I think we must come up with a new term Forget Keane eyes...how about Catherine Keener Eyes? She gives you the emotion without the slop. The one positive thing in all of this is that the film may be able to recoup its investment...at least for the moment. Itll be interesting to see if people will still turn out after the next week or so now that word is spreading that like Judith in the film ""its a downer."" Sorry but the only real downers are bad and/or overhyped movies. An American film that isnt afraid to make an emotional connection with its audience--especially in a big-budget form--should be cherished not trashed. It can transform ones appreciation of both art and life...a tranformation which those noisy transformers couldnt do if they tried. Posted by Bill Dal Cerro | October 24 2009 at 1055 AM Id like weigh in on the debate. I found the movie to be a shallow and unfairly manipulative film that expects you to take trivial as well as major personal relationship issues on faith. A spoiled kid who dishes it out but cant take it living in a self-centered fantasy ego trip is indulged as lovingly as possible by his family and runs away in his wolf suit aboard a small sail boat and heres where the phoney manipulative ""take it on faith issues"" begin. He survives a tremendous storm alive to land safely on a strange island. He meets up with child-like creatures even more naive and self-centered than himself who speak and understand English and have voices that couldnt possibly come from creatures that size. He convinces them that he is wiser than than they with arguments that are absurd - not to better relationships but to save himself from being eaten as were previous ""kings"". He does get them to live together in his castle instead of destroying each others stick homes but insists he have his own room as they sleep on the floor. His childish solutions to problems cause them to battle each other with injury to several of them and a bird even losing an arm. However personal confilcts continue to exist among them. When his useless existence there even gets to him we are expected to believe they are sorry to see him sail off leaving the poor creatures as bad off as when he arrived. He manages to sail safely back home with not a scratch on him a tear or a smudge on his still emaculate wolf suit. And finally having a bowl of cereal with his mother (with not a word spoken between them) we are expected to believe he has ""learned his lesson"" and will be a model son from then on...maybe. And if not why this film? John Kass I believe coined the word ""hopium"" which I think describes the ""cop out"" shallowness of this phoney weeper of a film. Id give it one star for the computer generated creatures and advise prospective viewers not to see it in the Imax format (or avoid it completely) because of the jumpy camera work and the too-close camera presence in the physical conflict scenes. I had the same feeling of being ""cheated"" as I did in the case of the ""Blair Witch Project"". All gimmickry and no substance. Posted by Mike Delaney | October 24 2009 at 1052 AM Where the Wild Things Are is my favorite book from childhood and one of our six-year-old sons favorites as well. (In fact his mom made him a Max wolf suit for Halloween a few years ago.) So even though I was pretty sure Spike Jonze wouldnt pull a Grinch or a Cat in the Hat on this book I was still a little worried that it either would not capture the spirit of the book or bore our six-year-old. Of course neither happened. My wife and I both found it moving and our son was glued to the screen throughout. And when Max left the place where the Wild Things are he cried. Hes never cried at a movie before which made it a little scary because you dont know if it means he didnt like it or was upset or would be scarred for life or what. But if you think about when adults cry at movies its usually not over a film they dont like. After he had a good cry we asked him if he liked the movie and he nodded very definitely that he did. In fact he wanted to go out and buy the DVD which we had to explain probably wasnt out yet. I think Jonze and Eggers captured an important part of what it means to be a child particularly the fears and frustrations of childhood. The beauty of a book like Sendaks is that it allows each reader to supply as much or as little additional detail as he or she wants. Well the filmmakers had to fill in for us or it would have been a very short subject. Its clear that they poured their hearts into rather than thinking about what would appeal to a family audience or any audience really. Thats the essence of personal filmmaking isnt it? And while I was worried that the movie version might alter the way I thought about the book it has but in a really good way which I didnt think was possible. To the reader who complained that Carol had anger management problems so dont most kids. I think thats the point. I loved James Gandolfini in the Sopranos but I honestly never thought he could move me that much in a voice-over performance. But his Carol was heartbreaking and unforgettable (the digitally created facial expressions helped too). All of the Wild Things were distinctly wonderful. Most movies aimed at kids go for laughs and/or impressive visual effects. Whats wrong with a movie that moves kids and maybe even makes them think? (Hint nothing.) Posted by Alex Lubertozzi | October 23 2009 at 0215 PM I really loved this movie because it confronts childhood with such honesty. This is not the Disney version thank God. Children are not depicted as totally lovable little creatures who have idyllic childhoods. Theyre shown realistically with behavioral problems and trouble understanding and adapting to their family and the world in general. Childhood is scary and anyone who thinks otherwise has probably blocked it out. I think children will relate really well to this movie. First they will relate to the wonderful creatures and effects. Second they will understand on a primal level exactly what Max is going through. Theyve been there weve all been there. For me it brought back memories of when I ran away as a small child. I had thrown a tantrum and been punished. I wanted my mother to be sorry so I hid in the bushes down the block. After waiting for someone to come and find we for what seemed an eternity I went home. I was shocked to find that they werent even aware that I was gone. Posted by Eileen | October 23 2009 at 0212 PM My 6 year old granddaughter talked me into seeing this movie. We usually see most of the kids films that are released but I was reluctant to see this one because the film trailers never really sold it for me. I am so glad we went. I loved it. My granddaughter loved it too and wasnt at all bored. She did get scared during one small sequence but it quickly passed. I wish they would make more movies for children of this quality. I highly recommend it. Posted by Chris | October 23 2009 at 1222 PM My husband and I went to see this movie on a Friday night in a jam-packed loud and rowdy teen audience and we were concerned at first that they would be talking through the whole movie ruining our enjoyment. Once the film started and through the remainder you could have heard a pin drop. Everyone was fully engaged and so were we. We thought this movie was brilliant and enjoyed every frame of it. We have read the book many times to our children (now all grown up) and felt the movie really did the message of the book justice and more. At the conclusion of the movie the audience was silent for a moment and then everyone broke out into spontaneous applause. That always makes for a great end to a group movie experience and why we keep going out to the movies Posted by Sharron | October 23 2009 at 0741 AM I think kids arent scared by this film -- theyre BORED by this film. Like the Wizard of Oz its a kids film that only adults love. Posted by Im right and you know it. | October 20 2009 at 1238 PM What downers some of these people are. Nora I would encourage you to watch the film objectively and not be on constant look out for clear cut cases of moral code. Or at least actions adhering to our typified idea of morality. Not every action warrants a consequence particularly in film. You are lamenting on about how there is no lesson learned for Max in the end. Im curious if we watched the same film as the entire subject matter was based upon Max ""learning"" something about himself. He eventually regretted his actions so he went home to reconcile with his mother. Although perhaps that wasnt enough for you. Perhaps you needed words or better yet subtitles to spell out the resolve of both characters in the end. I wonder if it occured to you that his mothers reaction was out of absolute relief for his reappearance not necessarily out of forgiveness for his earlier actions. We can only pray that when the DVD comes out there is an extended ending where Max is abruptly sent to his room (""No chocolate cake for you young man"") and then firmly spanked three times (""Thatll teach you to run away on me""). I sincerely hope so for the souls of our children. Oh dear God wont someone please think of the children? Watch it again and then get back to me. Peace. Posted by Isaac | October 19 2009 at 1027 PM Im 50 and along with my wife 29 year old daughter we took my grandsons (7 and 10) to see it this weekend. I was a fan of this book and LOVED the movie. I also had wished the bedroom transform scene had been there but other then that Jonse did a wonderful job of it. My daughter doesnt get the book nor the movie my wife and grandsons enjoyed it as well. Posted by Lantz | October 19 2009 at 0658 PM as i read the comments im shaking my head. what some people are deriding as irresponsible and such... whats far more irresponsible is denying that the world is complicated and families and feelings are complicated; then not preparing your child for a world filled with complications even for children. instead youd rather propogate an illusion of safety and bliss as long as possible. then you wonder why your children stop believing in you. this film respects all parts of childrens emotions. not just the happy sunshiney and sometimes laced with temporary sadness parts. further... theres this thing called the internet which had plenty of information about what this film is and any parent who is surprised by the movie they saw here can only fault themselves for not doing their job and learning before entering. Posted by zorro | October 19 2009 at 0626 PM say what you want about this movie it was the most beautiful film. My mom used to recite the book to me. I knew it by heart. This book resurfaced all the feelings I had as a kid. And no its not a childrens movie. Parts of it are frightening horrific and heartbreaking. But what is being overlooked here is the fact that childhood isnt always bright colors and laughs. Childhood is frightening sad and complicated. Yet there is love freedom recklessness and joy. This movie is not tailor-made for todays children who are used to digital animation slapstick humor and dumb jokes that we have degraded them to. As a result only a few children will appreciate this movie those who knew the true meaning of the book and arent afraid of true emotion. And you may think theyre kids they dont need to feel sadness or fear. The children who do not grow up to be the adults that generalize this movie into simple negative terms because they do not understand the truth in it. Which is sad for the children they took to see it. Big or small light or dark and strange as it is this is an important film because it reminds us all that we are WILD THINGS at heart. ) Posted by audrey | October 19 2009 at 0536 PM I think that our nation has suddenly forgotten what theater ratings stand for. Just because a movie is rated PG or G doesnt mean that its for children - it just means that it fits the standards of nonviolence or low violence no language etc. to attain that rating. You cant expect to take your kid to a G or PG movie and have it automatically be entertaining for someone that young. What I find remarkably hypocritical about so many of these reviews is that the people who are angry because this wasnt a movie specifically geared for young children are the same people who probably complain because adult movies are always filled with violence and foul language. What exactly are you hoping for or looking for in a movie? I personally am looking to be entertained and Where the Wild Things Are delivered on that in an incredible beautiful and poignant way. It stayed true to the story right down to my favorite line (Please dont go - well eat you up we love you so) while adding enough to make a real story out of it. There were so many moments that I was completely wowed by this theatrical spectacle - its truly an indie vision with a big screen budget. For those of you who think all animations are cartoons and that everything funny has to include fart jokes you might want to go see another movie. This isnt going to be your cup of tea. Posted by Hannah | October 19 2009 at 0228 PM goood film.. super thax Posted by celebrity trailers | October 19 2009 at 0939 AM I thought that this was a beautiful film albeit sad. It mirrored the emotions of childhood- especially those dealing with the tough issues of divorce and the anger you are too young to completely control. It was an incredibly moving piece. My perceptive 3 year old was not frightened but rather intensely interested in the emotional development of the story- telling me when Max was misbehaving and seeming awe-struck by Maxs relationship with The Wild Things. He understood the relationships and the lessons and was completely enthralled from open to close. I wouldnt expect the average 3 year old to enjoy this movie-- it more dialogue and emotional development/understanding than entertainment. But it is a beautifully portrayed story of the complexity of childhood emotions and family connections. Posted by Shanyn | October 19 2009 at 0751 AM This was amazing. If your children cannot comprehend the complexity this film can have they will at least enjoy the playfulness the film invokes. If they are scared easily wait until they grow up a little. This film is beautiful and the cinematography is jarringly breathtaking. I understand how the Wild Things may be perceived as a little scary but their appearances are the same as in the book. It shouldnt be a surprise to people that this is the way the characters look. I think some people forget what ""Wild"" means. I think some forget what it means to be a child. Im but a child myself and at 17 I can still relate to Maxs emotions and his dilemmas. Maybe thats why I enjoyed this film so much. Nevertheless the Wild Things in the film including Max are all examples of being wild and free. Theyre all beautiful complicated and remind us that perfect doesnt exist. However that doesnt mean happiness does not as well. But I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I am sorry to hear that there are people who didnt enjoy this film. Maybe the magic of this film was completely lost on them or Im just weird. I loved the movie amp; will be re watching it again. Posted by G | October 18 2009 at 1047 PM I LOVED IT I thought it was the most beautiful film I have ever seen The locations the music and actors all together moved me to tears...I had strong unexplainable emotions watching this movie) A+ Stunning Posted by Dee | October 18 2009 at 1016 PM There is nothing one can have other than empathy for those who are so shallow and vapid that they were ""bored"" by this film. The CW was created for them I guess. The film is not for young children probably not for anyone younger than Max. Er I believe Parental Guidance was in fact SUGGESTED. But it is an honest reflection on the confusion of being that age. The imagination IS a scary place for children. If your twelve year-old is going to have nightmares because of seeing this film you have bigger issues to deal with. Its not going to get better. And who ever said that art was supposed to have some sort of ""lesson"" for children? Or consequences? Was there really a big consequence for every naughty thing you did when you were nine? Really? I got away with crap all the time and still grew up thoughtful enough and with enough emotional breadth to appreciate this film. (and seriously take the phone away from Ethan. Whats wrong with you?) Posted by Hooray for Better Filmaking | October 18 2009 at 0617 PM Instead of trying to get into Paranormal Activity a group of my high school aged foriends and I saw this instead. Hands down the best movie Ive seen this year in terms of overall completion There shouldnt be too much that would upset a younger audience the 4-5 year old in the row behind me seemed to love it and cracked up half of the time. This movie made me want to crack open my copy of Where the Wild Things Are again. Definitely one to see. Posted by Chris | October 18 2009 at 0318 PM I took my 46and 7-year-olds to this movie last night. I had read some reviews and knew it would be a different movie and that I was taking a chance - Feeling out of control in his own world Max imagines a world where hes in charge. Although its fun at first soon it gets complicated and he realizes that its hard being ""the king"" and that you cant make everyone happy. He also learns that all families have problems but that doesnt mean they dont love each other. Near the end of the movie as I sat there thinking about all this I realized that my kids probably werent getting it at all. I looked over at them and my oldest two were moved to tears which started me crying too. My kids have never cried at a movie before. My daughter couldnt talk on the way home without crying again. It opened up a wonderful opportunity for a conversation how hard it is to be a kid but its also hard to be an adult Did they think the monsters were adults or children Who did they identify the most with and Imaginations are wonderful things. Yes its scary but not any more than any other kids movie out there. The thing about this one was that it was real and pure (absolute no potty words). Nothing seemed forced or fake. The monsters arent computer generated and I think it made my kids connect to them more. No its probably not for everyone but I found it to be magical and thought provoking.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young boy leaves home to live on an island of monsters. BOTTOM LINE Filled with raw emotion but somewhat lacking in fun CAST Max Records James Gandolfini Lauren Ambrose Catherine Keener LENGTH 140 For many adults the highest compliment you can pay a childrens book is that its ""not really a childrens book."" A few obvious examples Lewis Carrolls freaky ""Alice"" novels Kenneth Grahames enervated ""The Wind in the Willows"" and Maurice Sendaks short but intense ""Where the Wild Things Are"" now a live-action film directed by Spike Jonze who co-wrote with novelist Dave Eggers. Sendaks book deals directly with a difficult subject the rage of children and Jonzes film captures this beautifully during its opening scenes. Young Max (played by Max Records of ""The Brothers Bloom"") is a lonely imaginative boy whose single mother (Catherine Keener) has little time to spare. Negative attention being better than none Max screams fights and finally bites then runs away from home. advertisement | advertise on newsday What he finds is an island of enormous monsters (outfitted by Jim Hensons Creature Shop) who reflect aspects of Max himself quiet Douglas (Chris Cooper) kindly Ira (Forest Whitaker) crabby Judith (an excellent Catherine OHara) overlooked Alexander (Paul Dano) a mother figure named KW (Lauren Ambrose) and hulking Carol (James Gandolfini) whose combination of anger and sensitivity strikes an obvious chord with Max. Jonze and Eggers have a firm grasp on the way a childs joy can quickly turn to tears but they squeeze hard and cant let go. The film is essentially a parade of negative emotions - sorrow anger jealousy regret. And the choppy dialogue at times so cryptic that it borders on Beckett keeps the Wild Things from becoming full-fledged characters. ""Where the Wild Things Are"" clearly wants to be a childrens movie that isnt really a childrens movie and it succeeds. Thats great news - if youre an adult. imageCaption Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr HORNS OF PLENTY Max Records rides one of his new friends in Where The Wild Things Are (Matt Nettheim) A Where the Wild Things Are Genre Kids and Family Action/Adventure; Starring James Gandolfini Catherine OHara Max Records Catherine Keener; Director Spike Jonze; Author Dave Eggers Spike Jonze; Release Date Wide 10/16/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 100; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 14 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Profoundly beautiful and affecting Where the Wild Things Are is a breath-taking act of artistic transubstantiation. From Maurice Sendaks beloved picture book about a rambunctious little boy named Max and the kingdom of untamed creatures who adopt him as their like-minded king filmmaker Spike Jonze has made a movie that is true to Sendaks unique sensibilities and simultaneously true to Jonzes own colorful instincts for anarchy. This is to quote the 1963 childrens classic ""the most wild thing of all."" Its also personal movie-making with corporate backing at its best. Whatever the (well-documented) struggles it took to create this gem the result is worth every monster growl. ""Let the wild rumpus start"" Max declares in Sendaks pages and Jonze working from a just-right screenplay he co-wrote with simpatico spirit Dave Eggers begins the boy-centric hullabaloo from the very first frame. Max Records a Botticelli-faced discovery plays the fictional Max with a lovely purity of energy and freedom -- he has a rare kid-aged talent for concentration in the midst of brouhaha. When we first meet him careening around the home he shares with his patient mom (huggable Catherine Keener) Max is a boy on a tear all motor and no brakes. Whether roughhousing with his dog devising snowball-warfare strategies shrieking with a power surge of energy or collapsing in a childs heap of spent emotion Max is a dervish of mixed instincts. And Jonzes astute longtime cinematographer Lance Acord captures the jumble naturally chasing after the kid with the nimbleness of a monkey-cam. Its when Max pushes Moms tolerance to the limit -- Mark Ruffalo has a sweet small bit as a visiting boyfriend who wears the glazed smile of ""Do I really need this crap?"" -- that the heros adventure really begins. In Sendaks spare book (fewer than 350 words in all) Max outfitted in a really cool wildcat costume with whiskers travels to unknown territory without leaving his room. In Jonzes seamlessly expanded view he runs outside whiskers erect then boards a boat and heads to sea and on and on ""in and out of weeks and almost over a year"" (to quote the book) to the place where the Wild Things are. The dark colors of nightmares break into golden hues. The music by Karen O and Carter Burwell haunts. Such a place -- so playful and mysterious So liberating and scary (Yes some littler kids might be frightened during this PG-rated film but probably no more so than they already are in their dreams the kind that come with no rating system to guide a parent; besides to face ones demons is to tame them right?) Jonze and Eggers make a smooth storytelling leap by giving each Wild Thing a name and a personality joyously inspired by Sendaks own illustrations of the creatures bodies balloon-big heads and little V-shaped shark teeth. (Jonze regular Casey Storm designed the ebullient costumes.) Ill leave the discussion of personality integration to shrinks and online discussion groups. Any kid -- or adult for that matter -- can identify with the anxieties of Carol (James Gandolfini more delightfully vulnerable than weve ever heard him); the peace brokering of Judith (Catherine OHara funny to her marrow); and the squabbles preferences vanities and insecurities of Ira (Forest Whitaker) Alexander (Paul Dano) and Douglas (Chris Cooper). I especially like the measured feminine wisdom of KW (Lauren Ambrose). In their gorgeous landscape of dunes jungle and enigmatic structures that are as graceful as Noguchi sculptures (the production designer is K.K. Barrett) Maxs new friends show him the way home to a self he can live with. On the way I found myself bowled over with emotion. Sendaks great gift to readers old as well as young is the seriousness with which he presents even the wildest mayhem the deepest contradictions in human (and Wild Thing) behavior; the author empathizes with fantasists but has no time for cuteness. In his transcendent movie adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are Spike Jonze not only respects the original text but also honors movie lovers with the same clarity of vision. This is one of the years best. To paraphrase the Wild Thing named KW I could eat it up I love it so.

Hoberman Spike Jonze Cant Quite Get Spirit of Where The Wild Things Are On Screen Tuesday October 13 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 The adventures of Max king of the desertMatt Nettheim A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Directed by Spike Jonze from a 400-word childrens picture book first published in 1963 Where the Wild Things Are may be the toughest adaptation since Tim Burton fashioned Mars Attacks from a series of bubble-gum cards. Tougher actually Burton was working with ephemeral anonymous trash; Jonze is elaborating on a classic by distinguished author-illustrator Maurice Sendak.As its title suggests Where the Wild Things Are is a book about the Freudian id--and its also a media saga having served as the basis for an animated short an opera a ballet and a museum exhibit as well as a prop for child psychologists and some relatively discreet merchandizing. Thus tucked into a collective multigenerational unconscious the slender text exudes authority. Jonze has struggled to bring the book--which was to have been his first feature--to the screen for even longer than the eight years it took Sendak to finish it.The result isnt labored so much as well-behaved. Its difficult not to watch the movie as a series of decisions carefully made and problems responsibly addressed by Jonze and screenwriter Dave Eggers Will the unruly protagonist Max remain a pre-literate five or be older? (Older.) Is the projection of his inner world best achieved through animation or puppetry? (Puppetry.) Natural or fantastic landscapes? (Both.) What sort of music will comment on the action? (Insipid indie rock.) But mainly if one is to make something more than a 10-minute short how to open up the book?Wild Things does open promisingly with Max-ish doodles defacing the Warner Bros. logo and proceeds brilliantly in providing a bit of a backstory. Max (Max Record) is an apparently lonely nine-year-old living in a wintry old suburban neighborhood with an early adolescent elder sister and a harried single mom (Catherine Keener). Abandoned by his sis when her friends goodnaturedly wreck his front-yard igloo in a snowball fight mad Max retaliates by trashing her room.Unmotivated in the book Maxs tantrum here is triggered by his sisters betrayal and amplified by his mothers. (Women) When mom brings a date (Mark Ruffalo) home for dinner Max dons his wolf suit and chomps down on her shoulder. ""What is wrong with you? Youre out of control"" she shrieks as the bad boy flees the house. The music grows wilder--its Maxs night to howl. He finds a boat and sails off to discover his fellow Wild Things. So far so totally Cassavetes The first 15 minutes have a liberating handheld tumult only slightly mitigated by alt goddess Karen Os wistful borderline twee vocalizing.Arriving at the heart of darkness Max finds the Wild Things staging their own destructive freak-out in the woods. Nine-foot puppets with digitally enhanced expressions and celebrity voices (Catherine OHaras being by far the most expressive) the WTs are hyper-real reproductions of Sendaks cuddly-scary creatures--if considerably more loquacious. Master Record acquits himself well playing opposite these things particularly once he becomes their king and proclaims that the mad dancing shouting havoc-wreaking Wild Rumpus must begin. It is this taboo-breaking expression of infantile rage and the fantasy of omnipotence given a spread of six wordless pages in a 37-page book that Professor John Cech described in his tome on Sendaks poetics as ""a complete pre-Oedipal submersion in the childs ecstatic eroticism in which he satisfies his libidos wish to dance with the overpowering beasts of his own creation.""The book ends soon after; the movie goes for perhaps another hour. Falling asleep in the midst of a creaturely cuddle-puddle Max awakes not in his room as more or less happens in the book but to the realization that he the King of the Wild Things must rule. (Call it his Obama moment.) ""Will you keep out all the sadness?"" one subject wonders. Turns out that the Jonze-Eggers WTs are rife with complicated relationships hurt feelings lost best friends and secret new ones. (The identity of the latter makes for the movies funniest joke.) In an attempt to maintain his position King Max produces one rumpus too many--and the neediest member of the gang (James Gandolfini) rips off the big bird things arm (a horrifying moment actually). Yelling that the perp is ""out of control"" Max has learned what its like to be a parent Time to go home.While hardly as hysterical as Dorothys return from Oz the denouement does lack Sendaks unsentimental restraint--and consequently its power. Sendak was working from his own unconscious with Where the Wild Things Are a book he has called ""a personal exorcism."" The artist has cited early Mickey Mouse cartoons and King Kong as formative experiences with a Jewish subtext that would give the Coen Brothers conniptions. Sendaks yidishe mame used to scold him as a vilde chaya (wild beast) when he got too noisy while her family directly inspired the Wild Things ""They came almost every Sunday. My mother always cooked for them and as I saw it they were eating up all our food. . . . Theyd lean way over with their bad teeth and hairy noses and say something threatening like Youre so cute I could eat you up. "" The opera Wild Things assigns the creatures his relatives names. Shocking as Sendaks near-contemporary Philip Roth observed in the aftermath of Portnoys Complaint ""Going wild in public is the last thing in the world that a Jew is expected to do.""Jonze has said that Sendak encouraged him to find himself in Where the Wild Things Are. Dutifully the filmmaker gave Max a single mom and spent hours with Eggers talking about their respective childhoods. Not much poetic sublimation here. Whats best about Jonzes movie is its kinetic feel for physical play--herky-jerky camera as Max and the WTs zip and bounce through the forest--not surprising from a former skateboard punk like Spike. Whats weakest is its blandness the sense memory of a child raised on Sesame Street. The psychic environment is less King Kongs Skull Island than Fred Rogerss neighborhood Where the Wild Things Arent.Wild Things isnt overlong but it is underwhelming. Who is the audience? Children brought to see it might find it a downer--a case of what the New York Times has called ""misery for arts sake."" Triumph or travesty this movie is more likely something for Jonzes generational cohorts to love or loathe. (How many suburban garage bands had the name Wild Rumpus?)

Where the Wild Things Are Fair to good Director Spike Jonze. Cast Max Records James Gandolfini Catherine Keener. Rating PG for mild thematic elements some adventure action and brief language. Related Sendak ever-untamed sees book adapted How Wild Things ambled to screen Images from the film Family fantasy films Famously only nine sentences and 338 words long yet augmented by visionary illustrations it uses that brevity to capture with honesty and insight the anger and frustration of young Max sent to bed without his supper. Banished to his room Max creates a vivid world of his imagination escaping his troubles for what seems like a better world. But in the end maybe his is just fine after all. Theres not really a lot to Spike Jonzes film version of ""Where the Wild Things Are"" either. And while the film is touching even moving at times and the visuals every bit as visionary as Sendaks drawings that lack of a compelling narrative to carry it through the balance of a full-length 94-minute movie makes it ultimately less satisfying. Jonze and Dave Eggers with whom he adapted the screenplay must necessarily augment the story and while that might scare some of the books devoted fans they neednt worry at least not at first. The opening sequence in which we learn the source of Maxs frustrations is as good as anything in the movie. Max (Max Records) is a loner building himself an igloo setting himself up for a snowball fight with his sisters creepy friends. One of them overdoes retaliation smashing Maxs igloo; Max is hurt when his sister does nothing to help him. His feelings are further wounded and confused when his single mother (Catherine Keener) entertains a date (Mark Ruffalo). Wearing his wolf costume Max acts up bites his mother runs away. Its as good a representation of the conflicting emotions of childhood as youll see anywhere. Max sails to a land in which wild things giant monsters live. Only in the movie its more like the waiting room of a psychiatric ward for the clinically depressed. These are some seriously unhappy creatures. Jonze uses people in giant outfits for the monsters using digital effects for their faces. An outstanding cast including James Gandolfini Forest Whitaker Chris Cooper and Catherine OHara provide voices. Confused and searching themselves they crown Max their king and the wild rumpus of the book quickly follows. That too is delightful as is the tour Carol (Gandolfini) gives Max telling him that this is Maxs world it belongs to him. Max goes on to lead the gang in a dirt-clod war but thats when things begin to go south in a not entirely convincing way. Suddenly Max has poisoned the world. He promised a shield against sadness but everyones sad again. Carol both the father figure Max lacks in the real world and a representation of his yearning for the cohesion of family turns against him. Max tells Carol hes no king hes just Max to which Carol replies ""Thats not much."" Max heads home but is he defeated or empowered? Its difficult to tell. Both? He gets his hot dinner just like in the book. Record is adorable and quite good very genuine. The voice actors are as well Gandolfini and OHara in particular. There is some real magic here. But there is also the feeling that somethings missing that Maxs journey isnt quite complete; the dour mood of the monsters doesnt help. Theres a reason its not called ""Where the Sad Things Are"" after all. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

"Where the Wild Things Are Movie review of Where the Wild Things Are by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Where the Wild Things Are -- 2 out of 5 stars Max Records Warner Bros. Warner Bros. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The author of Where the Wild Things Are picked Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich) to direct the long-planned film of the much-loved childrens book. But whatever Maurice Sendak thought the quixotic Jonze would bring to the movie -- a penetrating understanding of the thin allegorical picture book perhaps -- what Jonze delivers with a script by Dave Eggers is not a childrens movie at all. This dull downbeat yet faithful adaptation has become a Sesame Street of the Spotless Mind.Max Records plays Max a kid who should be beyond donning his old whiskered wolf suit and terrorizing his mom (Catherine Keener). In a wintry opening built around an ends-in-tears snowball fight with his sisters teenage friends Max comes off as an impulsive hyper and self-centered brat. But hes sensitive enough to escape to his plush-toy filled room and to oblige with a fanciful tale when his hard-pressed single mom sighs ""I could use a story."" But a tantrum in the middle of moms date (Mark Ruffalo in a cameo) reveals Max for the Beastly Boy he is.""FEED me woman Roaaar"" He bolts from the house and in his funny costume stumbles across a sailboat that takes him far away to the island Where the Wild Things Are.Jonze creates a vivid organic trees-and-stones setting for this Island of Lost Muppets. Theyre a sensitive tribe with bad tempers fragile egos and easily hurt feelings. Max has only to exaggerate his status in the world and his roar to convince the plush beasts -- voiced by James Gandolfini Lauren Ambrose Catherine OHara Paul Dano and Oscar winners Forest Whitaker and Chris Cooper -- that hes their king. Since he promises to end loneliness and create warm welcoming sleeping piles of wild things they go along with him.""Let the wild rumpus start""If only. The movie lets Max and the Wild Things allegorically work out worries about relationships family and mortality. They also build this cool stick fort of Maxs design but even it gets in the way of their togetherness. Jonze and Eggers fret so much over the group dynamic (Carol the natural leader cant win over K.W. a cute beast with an aversion to selfish bullying) that they leave out the warmth the magic of discovery and the whimsy. No wonder Warners made them re-shoot this movie which was supposed to come out in March of 2008. Jonze plainly didnt re-shoot enough. Only the romping wistful childhood-remembered songs by Karen Orzolek (Karen O.) come close to capturing the right tone.As a childrens film its a bore. And as a grand film enterprise Where the Wild Things Are skirts the line between folly and fiasco. Its far too striking and thoughtful to dismiss outright. But it is literal and dour enough to make you wonder just why this book has the reputation it does and what on Earth the author was thinking in pitching it to Jonze. He got so lost in the"" things"" that hes left the ""wild"" and the fun out.Where the Wild Things Are Two of five starsCast Max Records Catherine Keener Mark Ruffalo the voices of James Gandolfini Forest Whitaker and Catherine OHaraDirector Spike JonzeRunning time 1 hour 38 minutes.Industry rating PG for mild thematic elements some adventure action and brief language. .

It seemed (regardless of the chatter over delays and studio clashes that has followed this project around) to be a perfect combination of parts Maurice Sendaks classic childrens book; director Spike Jonze the wacky mind behind Being John Malkovich and Adaptation (not to mention some of the best music videos around. And hey remember music videos?); co-writer (with Jonze) Dave Eggers author of A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius and co-writer of the charming Away We Go. Plus have you taken a good look at this Max Records kid who plays Max in this movie? He has the most sweetly melancholic face--one cant imagine him just walking into an audition. It seems more likely that the twee trinity of Wes Anderson Sofia Coppola and Mr. Jonze all joined forces to cook up his genetics Gattaca-style. The film starts off pitch-perfect. Young Max just like in the book is a mischievous boy who gathers snowballs to pelt his older sister and her friends makes forts throws tantrums etc. But Mr. Jonze is also able to capture how long those childhood afternoons can drag and how lonely being a kid can be. The rage that gets Max sent out of the room without dinner is more dramatic than it is in the source material (of course its impossible to make a 100-minute movie to match a book that takes somewhere between one and three minutes to read) and is borne of a new backstory about a divorced mom and her new boyfriend (oh hi Mark Ruffalo). Suffice it to say its not a mysterious forest that grows out of Maxs bedroom (bummer) but a fantastical journey that Max takes which involves a seafaring passage that would make the Losties proud. And there finally is where we meet our Wild Things. So heres the thing This movie looks so damn perfect. The sunshine filters beautifully through insanely tall trees and those giant puppets are great-looking and move with a balletic grace that is fascinating to see. Yet once Mr. Jonze and Mr. Eggers depart from the bare-bones text allowing the Wild Things to speak (its a little hard not to think of Tony Soprano when you hear James Gandolfinis voice even if its coming from a giant puppet) things get a little strange. The gang (which includes effective voice portrayals from Lauren Ambrose Catherine OHara Paul Dano and Chris Cooper) is less wild than they are unhappy and there are some very adultlike gripes and resentments running through the creature community when Max arrives. Which is not to say there arent some truly inspired moments within the film (just wait till you meet Bob and Terry). But something doesnt quite jell and no matter how gorgeous each set piece is it doesnt always entirely add up to a complete and satisfying narrative. I couldnt help but think from time to time how on earth were these guys allowed to make this movie? This one is certainly not going to be for the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs crowd. I cant imagine any young kid seeing it not just because parts of it are dark and kind of scary but because I cant imagine any small fry having the attention span to stick with it.

Fleet of foot emotionally attuned to its subject and instinctively faithful to its celebrated source ""Where the Wild Things Are"" earns a lot of points for its hand-crafted look and unhomogenized dare-one-say organic rendering of unrestrained youthful imagination. But director Spike Jonzes sharp instincts and vibrant visual style cant quite compensate for the lack of narrative eventfulness that increasingly bogs down this bright-minded picture. Widespread curiosity about the cinematic fate of Maurice Sendaks childhood perennial looks to spur sizable if not stellar commercial results in all markets including on Imax screens. Thematically comparisons to everything from ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""Coraline"" are not out of order for this flight of fancy on the part of an emotionally neglected 9-year-old boy; the driving impulse to escape an oppressive real life through creative fantasy is the same in all these books-to-films as is their success in speaking simultaneously to children and adults. At the same time contrasting ""Wild Things"" to two such superlative works in the same vein sharply shows up the new films lack of density and complexity. Granted Jonze had a lot less to work with going in as Sendaks 1963 volume consisting of just 18 picture panels and 338 words of text can be digested in less than five minutes. Its a simple but powerfully evocative tale of a mischievous boy who sent to bed without supper finds his room transformed into a dense forest and after a long sea voyage lands on an island populated by several fearsome-looking beasts whom he tricks into believing hes ""the most wild thing of all."" The most bracing section of the film is the first 15 minutes. Using a spot-on handheld camera and deft edits ruthlessly timed to when you need an air intake Jonze pins the action on the aggressive energy of Max (Max Records) as he terrorizes his dog bombards neighbor kids with snowballs and disrupts cozy time his mother (Catherine Keener) tries to have with a boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo barely present). A great-looking kid Records behaves with credible abandon and without any child-actor mannerisms provides the film with a solid center throughout. Perhaps the greatest liberty Jonze and screenwriting cohort Dave Eggers take with Sendaks little yarn is their dispensing with the flowering of Maxs bedroom instead having him run off into some woods in his white wolf costume and find a sailboat that takes him through turbulent seas to a distant shore. Upon arrival Max finds six large and potentially dangerous creatures variously outfitted with scary horns sharp claws pointy teeth and large stomachs that need filling. Taking advantage of the beasts general forlornness and evident need of an authority figure Max introduces himself and is quickly accepted as their king. As in the book Maxs immediate command is ""Let the wild rumpus start"" whereupon one and all engage in mad behavior worthy of kids of all ages. By the time everyone calms down however it dawns that these big wild things are just like people -- in fact rather too much so. Free to have the wild things speak however they wanted Jonze and Eggers surprisingly give them the voices and attitudes of middle-aged urban kibitzers; vaguely complainy and neurotic the creatures are dominated by their sense of isolation and sadness. On the face of it this is a choice with some wit behind it. But it also defangs the beasts from the outset -- one never fears that any of them would dream of making a meal out of Max -- and in the long run makes them far too ordinary. Absent any sense of jeopardy or dramatic complications the 70-odd minutes of screen time Max spends on the island (beautifully represented by rugged locations on the southern Australian coast near Melbourne) becomes a blur of rambunctious shenanigans fort building pretend warfare and confided feelings particularly on the part of the imposing Carol (James Gandolfini) the most developed wild thing and the one to whom Max becomes closest. There are fine creative inventions along the way notably the large birds nest-style structures the island inhabitants build and two funny squawking owls that arent in the book. But nothing much is ever at stake causing a story that begins in dynamic fashion to slowly devolve to the level of fleeting whimsy. Most of the attention the film received during its prolonged production centered on the difficulty of seamlessly combining the large creature costumes with CGI facial expressions. The wild things move around pretty well and interact with Max in a credible way that fully justifies the no doubt difficult decision not to use CGI all the way. All the more ironic then that the films biggest problem is not the look of the creatures but the manner in which they speak. That said the thesps provide low-key nuanced readings with Gandolfini and Lauren Ambrose particularly distinguishing themselves with dialogue that often seems odd coming from the toothsome mouths seen onscreen. Excellent production values stress the relative realness of whats on view compared to the digital worlds of most kidpics these days. The alt-rock tenor of the music scoring is refreshing at first but the predictability of the music cues proves increasingly wearisome.

By David Denby The wild things have mysterious relations with one another--friendships love affairs.   Credit Illustration by Pablo Lobato The opening sequences of Spike Jonzes ""Where the Wild Things Are""--a live-action feature based on Maurice Sendaks 1963 childrens classic--are sensationally good. Max (Max Records) is an angry nine-year-old boy his teen-age sister has abandoned him for her friends and his divorced mother (Catherine Keener) noodles on the couch with her boyfriend. The way Max Records plays him--with darting eyes and lips pressed together in rage--the boy has no idea that anyones feelings but his own could be real. He builds forts in his bedroom and an igloo in the front yard. He wants to be enclosed in his own imaginative space but he also needs to burst out and tear around and as Max crashes through the house Jonzes camera bounding up and down stairs stays with him and brings us as close to a boys impetuousness and egotism as were likely to get in the movies. The sequence has non-stop momentum and a juggernaut impact. Maxs mother tries to calm him down but he bites her on the arm and runs out of the house wearing a wolf suit its pointed ears sticking up like two little knives. As he gets into a boat and heads for the open sea the movie slows down and offers a different kind of wonderment the dark skies and foamy white waves of a perilous journey. Max arrives at a mysterious island and Jonze re-creating the monsters that live there stays close to Sendaks ineffably goofy style. The creatures are eight or even nine feet tall--snouted horned clawed and furry with huge heads and snaggleteeth that are as pointed as Maxs wolf ears. One is lionish another goatish--each suggests a different animal yet stays within a childs fantasy of that animal. An eccentric menagerie they are physically a little manic but theyre also almost tragic in their uncertainty and their melancholy. They briefly think of eating Max but claiming magic powers he shouts ""Be still"" and they crown him king instead. ""Let the wild rumpus start"" he cries and they all run and jump bash one another gouge holes in trees and fall down in a heap with Max happily nestled among them. Jonze the director of the witty experimental features ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" was right to use actors in elaborate suits (designed by Jim Hensons company) instead of animated figures to play the monsters. The creatures sail through the air now and then but most of their movements are weighted rather than slickly virtuosic or glib. Only their faces which have human-seeming eyes and mouths were digitally enhanced. Though Jonze stays faithful to the creatures he discards Sendaks sombre green-and-brown backgrounds. The movie was shot in Australia and the landscapes are fresh and bright; blossoms fall like a benediction through the trees and a big hairy dog rambles on a ridge above a blank yellow-sand desert. The best scenes are peerless in their creative freedom and warmth when Max sits atop the head of the monsters nominal leader Carol (James Gandolfini) holding on to the beasts horns and is told that the kingdom is his its an ecstatic image of childhood aggression fulfilled. Max has lost his old family but gained a new one and it pays him unlimited attention. Then ""Wild Things"" runs into trouble. Sendaks book was created for young children. The text is all of three hundred and thirty-eight words long; some of the drawn pages are rhapsodically wordless. But the movie has been designed for older children and adults and the creatures voiced by strong actors like Gandolfini Forest Whitaker Lauren Ambrose Chris Cooper Paul Dano and Catherine OHara never stop talking. As re-created by Jonze and Dave Eggers who collaborated on the screenplay they turn out to be a discontented and quarrelsome bunch. They have mysterious relations with one another--friendships love affairs--and deep-seated grievances. They throw jealous fits or walk off in a huff and we dont know where the hurt feelings are coming from. The bickering peters out then starts up again and after a while the creatures all sound like peevish adults elbowing one another out of the way at the smoked-fish counter at Zabars. No one gets enough love or respect. In the book the creatures are projections of Maxs imagination but these beasts are all too real and appearances to the contrary they arent wild things. Theyre becalmed even defeated. They build a twiggy fort that looks like a giant birds nest and then dont use it much. After their initial burst of energy they fall into a funk and the movie seems to be less about liberation than about futility. One of the things they ask Max when he becomes king is ""Will you keep out all the sadness?"" The answer it turns out is no. Jonze and Eggers have spoken of their desire to keep the film close to a childs needs but have they done that? Kids like danger followed by a release from danger and a return to safety yet the only danger posed by these creatures is that they will turn Max into someone as messed-up as they are. The filmmakers may have wanted to link Maxs anger to the creatures wounds but the connection is fuzzy--Max isnt the one who hurt them. I have a vision of eight-year-olds leaving the movie in bewilderment. Why are the creatures so unhappy? That question doesnt return a child to safety or anywhere else. Of one thing I am sure children will be relieved when Max gets away from this anxious crew. Its been apparent for some time that Peter Sarsgaard is an actor of major talent waiting for a major role and he almost gets one in ""An Education."" He plays David Goldman a London hustler of enormous charm who zips around town in a maroon Bristol sports car and seduces slowly and patiently a very bright sixteen-year-old girl named Jenny (Carey Mulligan). A student from suburban Twickenham Jenny feels hemmed in by her cautious parents and her school and is rather too easily dazzled by champagne supper clubs and a weekend in Paris. David ducks in and out of art auctions and houses for sale talking people into selling him things for less than theyre worth then reselling them at a profit. Hes furtive and improvisatory a genteel swindler. He never quite tells the truth but Sarsgaard plays him as a sensitive man who has genuine warmth and a gift that even an honest man may lack hes always plausible. No matter how far-fetched his inventions you want to believe in him; his attentions are so personal and so shrewd that theyre reassuring. Based on a short memoir by the talented acid-tongued journalist Lynn Barber (which was first published in Granta) the movie is set in 1961 when England was emerging from postwar austerities and the fabled antics of ""swinging London"" were just getting under way. Jenny ignores her exams passing up the chance to go to Oxford yet the luxury that David and his society-crook friend Danny (Dominic Cooper) introduce her to answers all the romantic dreams she has of lifes possibilities. Its not sex that holds her and David together but a heightened eagerness for pleasure of any kind and Jenny is caught. Smart as she is she somehow doesnt ask herself why such an attractive and seemingly accomplished man would bother with a sixteen-year-old. The movie is told from her point of view and only gradually does she begin to understand that theres something vaguely gangsterish about her lovers activities. Barbers memoir was adapted by the novelist Nick Hornby and much of the dialogue is sharply etched. (Emma Thompson has a couple of crackling scenes as a formidable stupid anti-Semitic schoolmistress.) The director Lone Scherfig was born in Denmark but is alive to nuances of class and money in England. She gives the movie a relaxed even tempo with an underlying uneasiness. Jenny is in real trouble and Carey Mulligan who worked with Sarsgaard in the recent Broadway production of ""The Seagull"" makes her fallible but brave; her Jenny can make foolish remarks without seeming foolish as a person. ""An Education"" is perceptive and entertaining but it doesnt have the jolting vitality of say ""Notes on a Scandal"" which dramatized an even more unconventional liaison--older woman fifteen-year-old boy. I have a feeling that Sarsgaard could have stretched the role a lot further if the script had allowed him to but still what he does is surprising. David may be a pathological liar but hes not quite contemptible. As Jenny wakens to each new impression of art food and travel David does too. This seducer is the opposite of jaded. Sarsgaard makes it seem as if David out of need desire and strength--and weakness too--were experiencing everything for the first time.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius Spike Jonze puts his own poignant spin on Where the Wild Things Are. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 12 2009 ShareThis (Photo Matt Nettheim/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Entertainment) What an impossible task Spike Jonze has set for himself adapting one of the few works that can be confidently called perfect. Maurice Sendaks illustrated childrens book Where the Wild Things Are is the tale of a little boys tantrum and his fed-up mothers rejection and of the dream that transports him over the sea in his wolf pajamas to a land of monsters that crown him king and help him act out all his rowdy infantile impulsesuntil the rage goes out of his system melancholy comes and he longs to return home. The huge creatures are right on the border between stuffed-animal cuddlesome and mythically grotesque. Childlike fantasies in Sendaks world are always double-edged They can liberate you or eat you upor both. Jonzes film is a different animal from Sendaks. Its tamer and more domesticated and its characters come with a backstory. As with many compact works to expand is to decompress and diminish. Jonze who wrote the script with Dave Eggers fills in too much of the life of Max (played by Max Recordshis real name fancy that) now a lonely casualty of his parents divorce who freaks out when his mom (Catherine Keener) gets frisky with a date (Mark Ruffalo). One alteration is unpardonable Max dashes out of the house and into the woods instead of getting sent to bed without supper so there are no bedroom walls melting away and no waves rolling inone of the books most archetypal images. No warm supper awaits Maxs return. What can you say? Bad adapters bad. But once the boy is in his boat being tossed on the waves things go swimmingly. Thats when Jonzes Where the Wild Things Are begins to cast a spell all its own. Jonze and Eggerss most agreeable innovation is turning Sendaks rather anonymous beasts into complex conflicted personalities. They sit around quarreling smashing things making holes in trees staring into space and wishing for a leader. Theyre like a counterculture commune after all the hippies and their woks have left after the drugs have stopped working so well. And then comes little Max who proclaims himself a king to keep them from devouring him. Max Records (I still cant get over that name) has a mop of dark hair and a sweet face but his Max is petulant and edgy. Its a wonderful performance; youd never know he was acting opposite nine-foot puppets. If youve seen the previews you know that the setting is real (its the rocky coast of Australia) and the creatures are decidedly not. The mix of an unruly landscape a live boy and kiddie-show fakery shouldnt jellor should jell only on the level of a Muppet movie. But it works like a dream. Instead of being bombarded by computer illusions were allowed to suspend our disbelief to bring our own imaginations into play. For all the artfulness the feel of the film is rough-hewn almost primitive. Its a fabulous tree house of a movie. There is CGI but its largely used for the creatures expressions. Outside of Gollum Ive never seen facial movements so evocative. Jonze rehearsed the voice actors together instead of taping them separately (by way of comparison Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres didnt meet until the premiere of Finding Nemo) and theyre like a crack repertory company. Catherine OHara is Judith who sounds like a whiskey-soaked biker momma; Paul Dano is Alexander the woebegone little guy with ram horns whos always ignored. James Gandolfini has tender plaintive cadences (all New Jersey gangster inflection expunged) as Carol the tempestuous lummox whose stringy-haired hippie-chick girlfriend K.W. (Lauren Ambrose) has left him. Carol needs a king a firm dad someone to direct his wayward energies. Hes the one who asks Max if he can keep all the sadness away and Max says he has a sadness shielda mistake in a world of such up ups and down downs. Im of two minds about how Jonze and Eggers go soft in the end. These wild things dont turn carnivorous when Max wants to leave. They act more like the Scarecrow the Cowardly Lion etc. But this isnt Sendaks Where the Wild Things Are and the creatures arent projections of Maxs id. Theyre a family which is what this fatherless boy needs. They dont eat their own. Like The Blair Witch Project the micro-budget horror picture Paranormal Activity proves that nothing is scarier than nothing. Think of a creak in the dark. You freeze. You wait. And wait. Its the waiting thats unbearable. What you dont know can hurt you. The perspective is radically limited We see everything through the video camera of Micah (Micah Sloat) a San Diego day trader. After his live-in girlfriend Katie (Katie Featherston) reports noises in the night and a malevolent presence he decides to document the goings-on. And that allows the director Oren Peli his one genius setup. Micah places the camera in their bedroom with a view of the bed and door and dark hall leading to the stairway. The couple turns off the light and goes to sleep. The image is pale greenish and white. Theres a timer on the screen 132 a.m. and 40 seconds 41 42 43 Then theres a low rumble faint sounds of walking or running. Sometimes Katie and Micah dont wake upthey watch the footage the next day. Or theres a thud and Micah jumps up and grabs the camera and hurries into the hall a little orb of light illuminating a corner or railing. Or he points the camera down the stairs into the darkness. A medium gives the couple the name of a demonologist but macho Micah wants to take care of this himself. He yells things into the dark like Is that all you got? We want to yell to Katie Call the demonologist now and dump the asshole 1 2 Next Share this story...
