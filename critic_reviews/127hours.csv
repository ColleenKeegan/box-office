Cast James Franco Kate Mara Amber Tamblyn. Rating R for language and some disturbing violent content/bloody images. Note At Harkins Camelview. On set with Danny Boyle filming 127 Hours Historical figures in film After days spent trying to free himself Ralston took the extreme measure of - spoiler alert I suppose for anyone not familiar with the well-known story - using a dull knife to cut off his arm. He then stumbled upon some hikers and eventually was rescued. Its a fascinating story of survival determination and grit. But is it a movie? Is it ever. ""127 Hours"" is based on Ralstons memoir and its a really good movie because director Danny Boyle is a genius. Boyle whose last film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" won eight well-deserved Oscars brings a stunning visual style to ""127 Hours"" somehow managing to make a movie about extreme loneliness in a small space huge to lift Ralstons plight inside the canyon out way out extending his vision to a trippy meditation on the value of solitude and sometimes its cost. James Franco meanwhile is an equal partner with Boyle in making ""127 Hours"" so compelling. Although Ralston meets a couple of hikers along the way and Boyle employs a few flashbacks mostly its just Franco a boulder and the audience. Not the most inviting combination of elements for a film but it works tremendously. Franco always has been good; here hes great navigating the transition from cocky outsider to a dying man desperate to belong - to belong to something to his family to the universe to anything. The film begins not with Ralston but the world in a screen split three ways showing various humming crowds around the planet zipping back and forth until were in Ralstons apartment as he prepares for his Utah hike. Soon hes tearing it up on his mountain bike crashing ass-over-teakettle popping up and laughing for more. His love for the outdoors not just of being in it but of it is infectious. He runs across a couple of lost hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) and turns them on to some of the little-known notches and pools of the canyons. Its a blast but Ralstons not out here for company something he has already made clear pointedly telling no one where hes going or how long hell be gone. Bad idea. Hell be gone longer than he thought. The boulder falls and the real movie begins (this is where Boyle drops in the title). Because we are an on-camera society constantly examining ourselves Ralston has brought a video recorder. He passes the time when hes not rationing water and bits of food taping himself sometimes as the host and guest of a self-loathing mock TV show sometimes in heartfelt messages to his family. Its an incredible performance by Franco walking the line between what once was enthusiasm but now is manic desperation. And yes the arm-cutting scene is as graphic as you may have heard (reports of audience members fainting and vomiting abound) though Boyle softens the blow a bit with perverse humor including sound effects from the old Operation board game. Boyles hyperstylized methods expand the story swooping shots leading out of the notch in the canyon outward. Its the inverse of ""Buried"" (also a fine movie) which brings us inside the wooden box in which a hostage in Iraq is trapped. Boyle goes in the opposite direction relating Ralstons situation to the world around him. Eventually as we wait for the Big Moment things do drag a little not enough to take us out of the moment - Francos performance assures that - but enough that were ready to get on with it. As Ralston no doubt was as well. But thats a quibble compared with the overall experience. After Ralstons days in the canyon his actions and sacrifice become not a tragedy but a triumph a word that also aptly describes ""127 Hours.""

For Trainspotting he countered the lethargy of heroin with energetic chases through the streets of Edinburgh and the beats of Underworld on the soundtrack. For Slumdog Millionaire he batted away all sorts of deprivation in favour of a final-scene Bollywood dance number in a Mumbai train station. When hes not having fun with genres (28 Days Later Sunshine) he has a knack for telling tales from the real world - but doing so from countless strange angles and with endless hurried flights of fancy and imagination. Nothing and no one stays still for long in a Boyle film.Theres little more gruesome and extreme than the story of Aron Ralston an American outdoors nut who in 2003 went canyoning alone in Utah without telling anyone where he was going. James Franco plays the frenetic 27 year old as an experience junkie and sociable loner. He bombs through the desert on a mountain bike leaving a trail of dust behind him. He meets girls in the wilderness makes them laugh and leaps into underground lakes with them before saying goodbye. He bounds over gulleys. Then he misses his footing slips into a canyon and a boulder follows him down pinning his arm to the wall just as he lands on his feet. Hes trapped and the films kineticism turns in on itself like Ralston its energy is stuck in a hole.From the off Boyle winds up our nerves with split-screens pumping music and archive inserts - and he never stops. We know of course that Ralston eventually escapes by carving off his arm with a penknife so theres a deep intake of breath when the accident happens early. Where will Boyle take us? Its a great challenge to witness and it brings out the best in Boyle. Just dont expect to breathe normally for some time.Boyle focuses intensely on Ralstons thoughts both rational and delusional as the days pass. He tries pulleys. He tries scratching away at rock. He tries everything. Francos performance is a brilliant show of constrained muscularity. We see flashbacks of his relationships and realise that he has some ways to mend if he ever gets out alive. Were stuck with Ralston and were privy to his mind because he keeps record with a camcorder in his rucksuck. On top of that Boyle uses every angle available to him and AR Rahmans score helps to capture and stress Ralstons mental fragility.The scene which all viewers will expect and dread in equal measure - the cutting of the arm - is horrific and smartly done. Boyle doesnt sidestep the truth we see Ralston picking through nerves as Rahmans music records the most nightmarish of internal body screeches. But neither does Boyle draw it out unnecessarily. We share Ralstons shock and wonder as he looks back at his bloody severed arm stuck behind the rock and like him wonder how it ever came to this.127 Hours is a tough ride not only because of the grim facts but because of the overwhelming experience of total cinema that Boyle inflicts on us to tell Ralstons story. At the end we stagger like Ralston from the dark into the light. We might have both our arms left but our nerves are just as terrorised.

He met girls fell down a canyon and got stuck. Thats like saying Shawshank Redemption was about some guys who sit about in prison and do nothing. Clearly you missed character development - not to mention the true story aspect that gives the whole story some weight. What did you think would happen in a film about a man that got stuck and had to cut his arm off? IMO Danny Boyle made a good film. He directed with his trademark visual flair and came up with some inventive ways of keeping the film flowing and dynamic. Also Franco gives one of his best career performances in what must have been quite a difficult role to pull off (having to keep the audiences attention whilst sitting in one place for most of the film).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 17 2011PEEJFeaturedAbsolutely terrible.

Opulence Studios James Franco in 127 Hours. (Photo by Chuck Zlotnick) Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an outdoorsman whos also something of a loner. He doesnt bother to return his mothers phone calls or tell anyone about his plans to explore a remote canyon. Although his independent spirit is admirable Ralston soon has reason to regret not being more communicative.Because this is one trip hes not likely to forget. Frolicking among the rocks he abruptly lands in the bottom of a ravine only to find his right arm pinned by a boulder. Unable to make contact with the world beyond the canyon Ralston must come to grips with a horrible reality Unless he takes drastic action hell die.As days go by images rush through his fevered mind -- and from our perspective across the screen. And the tension escalates as Ralston gauges his options. ""127 Hours"" pulls off the impressive trick of being highly entertaining even as it focuses on a hero whos stuck in claustrophobic circumstances. Based on the real-life Ralstons book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" the film was directed and co-written by Danny Boyle who is best known for the Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Despite its premise ""127 Hours"" is the most engagingly mesmerizing film youre likely to see this year.Thats largely due to Francos astonishing performance which maintains a balancing act between heartfelt distress and soulful wit. Hes practically the whole show and hes terrific skillfully mining the comedy in Ralstons dilemma without undercutting its seriousness. An Oscar nomination for best actor is just about guaranteed.Sure this may not sound like a film youre dying to see and the prospect of humor emerging from such a dire situation may strike you as dubious. But Boyle is such a gifted filmmaker that in his hands ""127 Hours"" is genuinely -- and unsentimentally -- inspirational. Movie reviews If you go 127 Hours Nov 23 2010 (...)

"127 Hours (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review 127 Hours (R) Real-life story of survival defies belief Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/24/2010 Editor rating 3 The mother of all ""What would you do?"" movies 127 Hours tells the astonishing harrowing story of Aron Ralston (James Franco) a free-spirited adventure seeker and experienced hiker who while climbing canyons alone in remote Utah slipped down a crevice and was trapped by a giant boulder that pinned his right arm. The area Aron was exploring was too desolate to expect a passerby to rescue him. All he had at his disposal were the supplies he had stuffed in his backpack which were only intended to last a day Some rope and hooks a couple of energy bars and a bottle of precious water. For the next 127 hours Aron remained trapped every attempt to dislodge himself failing. The rock was simply too heavy to move. Chipping away at the stone wall next to his hand (which began to grow a gruesome gangrenous blue) only made the boulder settle deeper. With each small sip of water Aron knew his time was running out. Eventually he resorted to the only solution possible Amputating his arm - with a blade the size of a thumb. 127 Hours sounds like a particularly gruesome variation on Buried in which the protagonist was also trapped and beyond rescue. But this movie is different First the story really happened (the script is based on Ralstons book Between a Rock and a Hard Place). Second director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire Trainspotting) doesnt keep the viewer trapped inside the canyon along with Aron. Through flashbacks and hallucinations (some frightening) we meet Arons family see snippets of his childhood relive his happiest moments and his biggest regrets. Essentially the movie recounts the thoughts of a man increasingly convinced he is destined for a slow death. Boyle has always been an exceptionally stylish director and despite its limited setting 127 Hours is a marvel of visual eye candy. From the flatlands of Utah to the shadowy increasingly gloomy crevice in which Aron is trapped the movie always gives you something remarkable to look at (theres only one sequence and Im sure you can guess what that is during which some viewers may be tempted to close their eyes; the really squeamish may even hurl). Franco who must hold the screen the way Ryan Reynolds held it in Buried -- mostly by himself -- conveys such a wide range of emotions that an Oscar nomination is practically guaranteed. In order for 127 Hours to work you have to want to see Aron escape -- if not intact at least alive. Francos performance ensures youll be with him every agonizing second. This is a deeply inspirational movie about the human spirits refusal to give up but it is also a portrait of a man too much in love with life to let go without a fight.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune November 19 2010 -- 111pm Video (0650)  Based on the true story of hiker Aron Ralston who had to amputate his own arm after it became trapped by a fallen boulder. Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""127 Hours"" is -- trust me on this -- an inspiring story of self-amputation. The film dramatizes canyoneer Aron Ralstons ordeal when a falling boulder pinned him against a rock face for five days. It sounds agonizing and there is an atmosphere of desperation and loneliness through much of the movie. Yet in the wizardly hands of director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") the nightmare becomes a tribute to Ralstons bravery -- without casting him as a hero. He just got tired of waiting to die and decided to live. James Franco plays Ralston as a frolicking daredevil. In the introductory scenes A.R. Rahmans score yells youth and vigor while split screens contrast Ralston self-sufficiently setting off for a solo day of mountain biking and camping with the herds of workaday sheep heading off to drab office routine. Ralston powers his mountain bike to a crash and gets up laughing. He meets a couple of cute girl climbers and charms the pants off them (just about). They pick up on his carefree narcissism. ""How much do you think well factor into his day?"" one asks her companion. The line packs a satirical punch yet his new friends do play a recurring part in the dreams premonitions and hallucinations that flood the climbers mind once hes trapped. Connections to his family and ex-girlfriend Rana (Clemence Poesy) remind Ralston that despite being submerged in ""pretty deep doo-doo"" he has something to live for. Flights of fantasy Youd suspect that once Ralston winds up wedged into a narrow gorge with a Nalgene water bottle a sandwich and no cell phone the film would become an essay in claustrophobia like the recent ""Buried"" which confined its hero to a coffin for 90 excruciating minutes. Far from it. ""127 Hours"" follows Ralstons memory and imagination on digressive flights and thats the films central flaw. Chuck Zlotnick Fox Searchlight James Franco in ""127 Hours."" Boyle puts a camera inside Ralstons flask to show his ever-dwindling supply of water. He zooms up up and away from Ralstons cramped prison to a satellites perspective of Utahs Canyonlands National Park. He switches to Ralstons video camera point-of-view as he clowns through a game show parody to lift his spirits then dictates a heartfelt farewell to his family. Boyles camerawork is so hyperactive and his editing so manic that the tedious gravity of Ralstons predicament rarely weighs on us. Id have been happier if the film made us feel trapped too. Francos performance by turns pathetic and captivating is powerful enough to hold our attention. ""127 Hours"" is fundamentally a punishing coming-of-age story as a cocky daredevil has the ego pounded out of him by indifferent nature. Francos crestfallen expression as he realizes the series of selfish steps that brought him to this brutal comeuppance is more eloquent than any dialogue. When he tearfully tells his mother in a video message ""I wish Id returned all of your phone calls"" you feel it in your throat. Lets cut to the chase the amputation of Ralstons wedged appendage with a dull multitool blade. Its vivid and intense without being offensively graphic or gory. Boyle knows that simply imagining the event will give viewers the heebie-jeebies. I winced averting my eyes once or twice but when it was over my overall feeling was of admiration for Boyles tact. The queasiest aspect of the sequence is a jangling sound effect symbolizing the agony of severing a stubborn tendon. It will make your toes curl like a whizzing dental drill pressing down on a raw nerve. If a Best Sound Oscar can go to a single audio effect we have a winner.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 12 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The movie 127 Hours is based on a real-life freak accident that befell adventurer Aron Ralston. In 2003 the then-27-year-old out on a solo hike got trapped in a Utah slot canyon when a boulder fell and pinned his right arm to a wall of rock. After five days delirious and dehydrated Ralston amputated his lower right arm like an animal in a leg-hold trap chewing through its limb. Movies 127 Hours The official trailer A year later he published a best-selling book about his ordeal ( Between a Rock and a Hard Place) and did the talk-show circuit. I saw him speak and present a slideshow at the 2004 Banff Mountain Film Festival where he was already known as part of the climbing fraternity. Neither exactly inspirational nor cautionary his story fell into the astonishing-but-true category of adventurers near-death experiences. Theres an undercurrent of terror in 127 Hours but its not ultimately about the fear of being trapped under a rock or DIY surgery. All the characteristics of the movie - the swooping camera over the surreal terrain of the Utah desert A.R. Rahmans burbling percussive score the flashbacks the hallucinations the fantasies - are demonstrations of director Danny Boyles fear of boring his audience. Presented with the storys minimal Sisyphean elements (man rock time) Boyle goes to extreme lengths to make his film exciting triple-screen images of a stadium full of people the bulls running at Pamplona a swimmer breaking through the water. Then theres a stimulating prelude to the main event when Ralston (played with slacker charm and wonky rhythms by the endearing James Franco) invites a couple of young women Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) to take a shortcut terrifying and thrilling them in the process. The dramatic point seems to be that Aron is an adrenaline junkie in need of a life-changing experience to awaken his empathy gland. Count on Boyle and co-screenwriter Simon Beaufoy ( Slumdog Millionaire The Full Monty) to find an opportunity for reform and redemption even from an encounter with a rock. Once the movie gets well not exactly rolling Beaufoy and Boyle are even more desperate to distract us from Arons limitations. There are false escapes and imagined visits from Scooby-Doo and a compatriot of Butch Cassidys and a bedroom flashback to the girl (Clemence Poesy) Aron was too independent to love. Later when his water supply runs out Boyle provides us with a urine-cam (following his descents into toilets in Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting) as we enter the yellow bubbling tube leading from Arons canteen. At its best 127 Hours is a relationship between Franco and his video camera. Starved skinny looking humbled and wasted the actor presses close to the camera as if begging us to reach through the screen and help him (though the pimple inside his nostril is probably as disturbing as the surgery). His world is shrinking but the camera still cant calm down. When the tease cant be justified any longer when the blade meets the gristle its almost a relief. Even here Boyle cant be straightforward. For aspiring orthopaedists in the audience Boyle offers an X-ray view of the sweet spot where the ulna and radius bones of the lower arm connect to the humerus. (Humerus? I thought Id die.) Shiver-making moments aside in a important way 127 Hours suffers from the filmmakers lack of nerve a reluctance to let the audience taste Ralstons dread and the expectation of a slow absurd death. There was a startling detail in Ralstons recent interview with The Globe. He said he was smiling as he cut through his arm because he was contemplating his imminent freedom. I wish Boyle had the nerve to show that moment. 127 Hours Directed by Danny Boyle Written by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle Starring James Franco Classification 14A Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining?

A boulder slides down a narrow canyon behind Aron Ralston pinning his right wrist and forearm against the wall. In fact the entrapment occurs so early in director Danny Boyles drama a moviegoer could fear that something boring this way comes. Instead in a vigorously true work James Franco mesmerizes as the Colorado mountaineer who became famous -- and remains so -- after he was forced to amputate his arm to escape certain demise in Utahs Little John Canyon in 2003. Of course the first fears that this film will be a slog are not unreasonable. After all Ralston was hiking alone when the incident happened. Because he hadnt left a note back in Aspen about his intentions it would be some time before friends family colleagues began to fret. The usual sources of time-running-out tension -- the determined desperate search; the pervasive worry of loved ones -- wont be relied upon here. Not only is Ralston trapped; so are we. And this is the gripping genius of Boyles approach. In his impressive follow-up to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" the Academy Award-winning director honors the lure of solitude while at the same time celebrating the beautiful necessity of other people. He establishes this seeming contrast during the opening credits. Like nearly all of his films -- ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" come to mind -- this movie begins with unbridled verve. Music blares and the choice of Free Bloods song ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" is pitch perfect. (""There must be some -- blank -- chemical in our brain that makes us different from animals. . ."" go the lyrics.) Split-screen images of a scruffy guy packing hurriedly for a quicky sojourn are juxtaposed with images of swarms of people the latter representing Boyle recalled in an interview (and quoting famed climber Joe Simpson) ""the living world of anxiety."" Coloradans and other Westerners in particular know that desire to escape the human throng for the natural world. Co-written by Boyle and ""Slumdog"" scribe Simon Beaufoy ""127 Hours"" trims Ralstons accomplished and eloquent memoir ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" (2004) into lean drama. It zeroes in on an individual while exalting the universal the powerfully human. Boyle explores the darkest of moments but believes in the magnetic tug of a thing called love parental filial romantic. The list of tender nuances goes on. Could we do what Ralston did to free ourselves? Incredibly fit an outdoor guide and one-time mountain rescuer he knew a great deal about survival about dehydration about sinew and bone. But would each of us do everything possible to rejoin those who matter to us? Thats the question at the heart of ""127 Hours."" Franco is ace at capturing Ralstons love of the life lived outdoors. Hes nearly ecstatic as he bikes from his car to the canyons. Happily he bounds along rock and rutted road music blasting in a headset. The joy continues when he hooks up with two hikers. Kristi and Megan were the last to have contact with Ralston before his accident. Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn capture the caution and fondness that can pass between strangers. Its a gendered thing and a canny scene their initial suspicion of a solitary guy racing toward them out of nowhere scarf over his face. The trios spontaneous adventure is -- in a word -- awesome. Hes still buzzy (and were still smiling) when soon after he slips in the canyon. Over time his surprise is replaced by a dance between a freaked-out self and a beautifully problem-solving mind. Ralston graduated with a double major in French and mechanical engineering. Boyles unerring focus on Ralston doesnt mean ""127 Hours"" is without other humans; far from it. The film is rife with flashbacks and memories (and there is a soaring raven that comes to mean a great deal to Ralston too.) Early on Ralston begins leaving his loved ones video commentary. Perhaps it says something loony and true about our culture of self-surveillance that Ralston brought a videocamera but not a functional knife. In a pivotal scene his water running low and a kind of fuzzy delirium setting in Aron Ralston takes himself to task. Its an ace performance of recrimination and sorrow. From nearly the start of the disaster Ralston knows the only way to free himself is to lose his arm. Boyle is a master of the tactile the visceral. And the dismemberment is brilliantly crafted. Sound more than sight does the trick. But the fundamental power of ""127 Hours"" isnt really about the arm. Its about three little words we all should use from time to time. And though ""I love you"" is a good guess see the film for the answer. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpostcom/ madmoviegoer ""127 Hours.""

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 5 2010 Save for later Saved James Franco portrays real-life Aron Ralston in 127 Hours. Ralston wrote a memoir about his extreme measures to survive a rock slide. Fox Searchlight          View Caption James Franco as Aron Ralston gauging his options. Fox Searchlight          View Caption About video ads View Caption of What would you do if you were a hiker and a rock slide pinned your arm against a narrow canyon wall and help was nowhere to be found? If youre Aron Ralston who subsequently wrote a book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" about his real-life 2003 ordeal in Bluejohn Canyon Utah you exhaust all nonsurgical remedies over the course of 127 hours and then you do the dirty deed. You sever your right forearm.This sequence which provides the grisly inevitable climax to Danny Boyles ""127 Hours"" has reportedly set off a wave of fainting spells at preview screenings. Its only a movie folks though you may want to look away anyway. I didnt thereby ruining my dinner plans.James Franco plays Ralston and except for a lovely pre-rock slide interlude where he cavorts with two fetching lost hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) hes basically the whole show. Franco is a remarkably engaging actor - a prerequisite here - but Boyle understandably tricks up his predicament with a slew of Ralstons imaginings and fantasies and swaddles everything in a throbbing synthopop score. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The problem is most of Ralstons deliriums seem more like Boyles (even the ones that come straight from the book). Ive never been a fan of Boyles hyperkinetic pyrotechnics. From ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Trainspotting"" right through to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" he cant resist juicing everything he touches. He takes slickness into the stratosphere. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Boyles hard-sell split-screen stylistics - he intercuts everything from stadium crowd scenes to a biblical-size flash flood - are especially flagrant here because they contrast so sharply with Ralstons stark situation. (By the way given the limited dramatic choices its amazing how many product tie-ins Boyle manages to work in.)There is also something vaguely unseemly about the way Boyle and his coscreenwriter Simon Beaufoy tease out our expectation of the inevitable. Since Ralstons ultimate decision even for audience members who arent already prepared for it is essentially a given were placed in the uncomfortable position of being set up for the big payoff. This wouldnt be so bad if the events leading up to the amputation had a lot less glitz and a little more gravitas but too often they come across as glorified diversionary tactics.As a testament to positive thinking ""127 Hours"" will probably stand as a ringing affirmation for reckless survivalists. For those of us not so affirmed Boyles paean to heroism - a better title for it might have been ""A Farewell to Arm"" - is merely the best gross-out music video ever made.

Comments (3) 127 Hours Rated R  93 minutes  2010 Based on a true story this drama by British director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) features a terrific performance from James Franco as a cocksure rock climber who gets pinned by a boulder during a solo excursion in a Utah canyon. Boyle loads up on visual gimmickry to indicate the passage of time the depletion of the heros resources and whats running through his head. But aside from an exhilarating opening and a gruesome climax the movie isnt all that rich emotionally; all the visual razzle-dazzle winds up serving a pat lesson about people needing other people.

Over the next five days Ralston examines his life and survives the elements to finally discover he has the courage and the wherewithal to extricate himself by any means necessary scale a 65 foot wall and hike over eight miles before he is finally rescued. Throughout his journey Ralston recalls friends lovers family and the last two people he ever had the chance to meet? A visceral thrilling story that will take an audience on a never before experienced journey and prove what we can do when we choose life. Starring James Franco Lizzy Caplan Kate Mara Amber Tamblyn Clemence Poesy Kate Burton Darin Southam Elizabeth Hales Norman Lehnert Priscilla Poland Director Danny Boyle Running time 133 Release Opened Nov 12 2010  Editorial Review The deep strata of the human spiritBy Ann HornadayFriday November 12 2010""127 Hours"" tells the true story of Aron Ralston a climber who in 2003 became trapped in a slot canyon in Utahs Canyonlands National Park his right arm pinned under a falling boulder. Most of the buzz about the movie which stars James Franco as Ralston centers on the films climax when Ralston breaks and then amputates his own arm in order to escape certain death. Early reports of audience members passing out notwithstanding that harrowing event actually accounts for a very brief albeit jarringly realistic episode in ""127 Hours."" And although Ralstons act of desperation is admittedly difficult to watch viewers who might avoid the film out of squeamishness would be depriving themselves of one of the years most exhilarating cinematic experiences. Having directed ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and now this British filmmaker Danny Boyle has solidified his stature as an artist possessed of a singular gift for aestheticizing misery. With a nervy vivid visual style and a commitment to humanism at its most life-affirming Boyle makes the unbearable not just endurable but beautiful. Hes helped enormously in this endeavor by Franco who as Ralston embodies the intrepid outdoorsmans exuberance and charm but also his darker flip side of isolation and arrogance. When Ralston sets out for Utahs Blue John Canyon on a pristine April day hes told no one where hes going; his belief in his own physical and mental superiority makes him feel above the usual safety rules. That exceptionalism will prove pivotal once hes trapped in a narrow sandstone crevice for five days. But first ""127 Hours"" offers viewers a glimpse of what lures Ralston to the desert in the first place in a wildly kinetic montage of split-screens canted camera angles and giddy jump cuts Boyle captures the adrenaline rushes and peak experiences that prove so addictive to Ralston and his fellow hikers and climbers. When he meets two cute fellow travelers (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) on the trail he leads them to a sublime underwater pool where they splash and dive like sleek otters ecstatic with their own ruddy good health and a benevolent natural world of near limitless scope and seductive pleasures. As a portrait of youthful recklessness amidst the grandeur of indifferent nature ""127 Hours"" may remind some viewers of Sean Penns magnificent ""Into the Wild"" about a similarly brash young man on his own physically extreme journey. Like that earlier film Ralstons story plays like a 21st century extension of the American transcendentalist tradition where enlightenment and spiritual communion mesh so poetically with the rugged landscape of the countrys frontier. In Ralstons case mysticism arrives only after hes brought his mechanical engineers ingenuity to bear on his predicament (to no avail). Once dehydration and delusion kick in his flashbacks and visions take on an increasingly hallucinatory quality with ""127 Hours"" taking on a commensurate magical-realist visual style. As the character who virtually begins and ends his journey as two different men Franco delivers the performance of a still-promising career. Starting with the sublime TV show ""Freaks and Geeks"" through ""Milk"" and now ""127 Hours"" Franco has proved his bona fides as an actor whose gifts run deeper than mere boyish charisma (although he possesses that in abundance). He carries this film with the same life force and complex emotions that animate Ralston himself as he first tries to prevent and then make peace with and finally take charge of his fate. Oddly enough as a young man on a search for self-actualization Ralston has more than a little in common with the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg whom Franco plays in ""Howl"" and who did his own part for advancing transcendentalist literary values. As elemental as Ralstons ordeal is and as excruciatingly visceral as Boyle makes it ultimately ""127 Hours"" isnt about the physical struggle for life as much as psychic struggle to find meaningful connection within it. Its a movie worth seeing even when its barely watchable.Contains profanity and some disturbing violent content and bloody images.

Starring James Franco. Directed by Danny Boyle. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A young adventurer is navigating a crevice between two mountains of rock. He steps on the wrong thing falls about 20 feet and ends up with his right arm crushed underneath a boulder. He cant get out. No matter what he does he is stuck. No one knows where he is no one can hear him scream - theres probably not a soul around for many miles. All at once his life expectancy is less than a week. Hes going to run out of water and die. In ""127 Hours"" director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") tells the amazing true story of Aron Ralston who didnt die but rather lived to write his memoirs ... with his left hand. How he got out is a matter of public record and is something virtually everyone will know going in but knowing doesnt enhance the experience of the movie. It makes it even more excruciating. ""127 Hours"" about an unimaginably unbearable experience is pretty much an unbearable experience of its own. And yet it must be said its exceptionally well made. Boyle takes a situation thats almost impossible to make cinematic For about an hour of screen time maybe more James Franco as Aron is stuck under a rock. Aron wants to be any place but there and so do we. Aron cant leave the rock but we can easily get up and leave the theater. So Boyle employs memory sequences fantasy sequences breathtaking images of nature and perhaps a dozen shots so imaginatively conceived and framed that one cant help but feel awe at Boyles visual mastery. The problem is that ""127 Hours"" has the feeling of a film conceived for that very purpose to be so static and lacking in narrative movement that theres nothing to notice but the directors flair. Boyle more or less keeps the enterprise from sinking and yet for all his exertions ""127 Hours"" is not exactly enjoyable. Its an ordeal for Aron and for the audience too. Nor is the suffering worth it. The film does not have anything near a psychological or philosophical depth on a par with its visual inspiration. Its just a story about a bad thing that happened to a happy-go-lucky goofball. Hes an idiot when he gets stuck under the rock but by the time he gets out hes not an idiot anymore. Hes not a hero either but hes tough as rock and has the guts of 10 men. This comes through in Francos performance but in a muted way because hes not really Boyles focus. Boyles focus is his own virtuosity. ""127 Hours"" is sometimes agony to sit through sometimes dull to sit through and some shots so gruesome so gory and horrifying that many viewers will never see them. Theyll avert their eyes. Still hardly 10 minutes ever go by without Boyle showing us something extraordinary. Sometimes its a shot of the sun breaking into the crevice and warming the rocks. In another case its an extended fantasy sequence in which cascades of water rescue Aron and he shows up at an ex-girlfriends door begging for help. Boyle does something remarkable with sound. Two or three times when Aron experiences blinding shrieking inconceivable pain Boyle shocks the audience with a loud electric-buzzing sound that in its harshness and suddenness - in the way it overwhelmingly becomes the only thing in the room - becomes a sonic analogue for pain. Its an impressive effect. When hes in pain so are you. So ""127 Hours"" is the work of a very talented person. But I cant imagine Id have endured more than 30 minutes of it were it not all in a days work. -- Advisory This film contains strong language - if a boulder fell on you you wouldnt just say ""Oh fiddlesticks"" - and horrible disgusting disturbing scenes of gore and terror.

The latest from Danny Boyle is actually an ode to survival a bracing story of man and nature and an exhilarating sensory experience. Its my favorite movie so far this year. Cocky sportsman heads out for a little weekend-warrior adventure only to get taken down a notch by unforeseen elements. Its a classic premise tapped by movies including Deliverance (1972) except this time the menace isnt a wild river or a crew of backwoods Georgia predators. Its a boulder that fells Aron Ralston (a superb James Franco) a freewheeling Utah canyon climber who misjudges a rock falls below the radar of any human activity and gets his arm pinned but good.How to turn an immobilized explorer into dynamic cinema? First you call Boyle a director who could make rush-hour traffic a visceral and kinetic experience. He puts us inside Arons head from regrets and triumphs to unbearable thirst. He also finds creative ways to externalize the panic and introduce jolts of humor that prove absolutely necessary. A mellow chatterbox with a video camera in tow Aron conducts a mock morning-show interview with himself to flesh out his poor planning and hubris. Boyle makes the moment complete by dubbing studio audience response onto the soundtrack much as he interpolates music as an ironic commentary on Arons predicament. Time and again Boyle finds a universe of options in a claustrophobic setting.It would be a mistake to define 127 Hours as a mere head trip. Its a remarkably physical and tactile film. We see and hear a single ant as it crawls on Arons belongings. Aron learns to time the flight of a bird as it flies overhead every morning. When he resorts to desperate measures to stay alive including drinking his own urine from his camel bag the point-of-view shot comes from inside the bag (remember this is the director who gave us toilet swims in both Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire). Boyle has a rare gift for making us feel exactly what his characters feel. He shifts from Arons internal life to his external surroundings so deftly that the difference between the two becomes moot.Few actors are asked to carry the kind of load Franco handles here. After a brief prologue largely spent in the company of Aron and a couple of hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) 127 Hours becomes a one-man show. Theres nowhere else to turn and Franco goes to work with sly gallows humor that doesnt undercut the characters newfound sense of his own mortality. Mark him down for an Oscar nomination.By the time the moment arrives 127 Hours has already precluded the possibility of cheap bloody thrills.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + You have to hand it to Danny Boyle He doesnt shy away from a challenge. The director of ""Trainspotting ""Millions and ""Slumdog Millionaire has taken as his latest project a true story about a man stuck in a hole in the ground. In May 2003 during a day of solo canyon-hopping in Utah 28-year-old Aron Ralston found himself trapped in a crevice with a giant boulder pinning his arm to a wall. He remained there for five days before a dull knife and a spot of horrific do-it-yourself surgery allowed him to escape.Right theres the problem How do you make a movie about immobility? For a hyperactive stylist like Boyle whose movies are at best thrillingly kinetic and at worst represent death by a thousand cuts the solution turns out to be absurdly simple. He heads inward. ""127 Hours is a movie experience both grueling and transcendent and its most intoxicating scenes play in Ralstons head and heart as the days wear on. What begins as a story of survival becomes something infinitely more moving a mans journey back toward the human race.When the film begins Ralston doesnt need anyone. Hes played by James Franco that sly skinny changeling of an actor with an energy thats almost frightening. Ralston jumps out of bed in the city and within seconds is barreling through the desert on a bicycle ecstatic at being released once more from the bondage of civilization. Unlike Chris McCandless of ""Into the Wild hes not propelled by discontent or an unhappy childhood but by the sheer joy of being out in the world. Solitude is only part of the high.At one point Ralston crosses paths with two women hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) and leads them to a hidden pool like a mischievous sherpa; the scenes a plummet into abandon that flirts with eroticism and then lets it go. Our heros just not interested. Then karma comes calling in the form of that two-ton rock and ""127 Hours settles in for the duration.The particulars of Ralstons ordeal are faithfully catalogued the slowly falling level in his water bottle the sunbeam that warms him for 20 minutes a day. Retrieving a dropped pocket-knife becomes an epic adventure in its own right. Ralston was trained as an engineer and the part of his brain that isnt seizing up with panic considers his plight as a classic mechanical problem a matter of levers pulleys torque. The larger drama is that of an overconfident man slowly realizing he cant ace the biggest test of his life.Boyle jazzes this up as best he can and sometimes his camera goes where its not necessary -- up the drinking tube of Ralstons CamelBak for instance or down a water bottle filled with the hikers own urine. At other moments ""127 Hours pirouettes with absolute rightness into visuals that recalibrate everything weve seen like the pullback that reveals how insignificant Ralstons crevice -- and Ralston himself -- is in the vast harsh beauty of the Utah wilderness. A similar shot worked in ""Slumdog Millionaire but it works better here less show-offy more brutally to the point.The videos the hero records first to document his fix and ultimately as a last will and testament allow him (and Franco) to play to a narrowing audience with grim humor. As he weakens his ghosts come out to play parents (Treat Williams and Kate Burton) a beloved sister (Lizzy Caplan) friends Arons younger self (Koleman Stinger). All the people he loves but thought he didnt need dropping in to taunt him with their kindness. They settle into the bottom of the crevice on a sofa watching as he fades and goading him by their very presence into one desperate last act.There have been faintings reported in theaters when the next scene unspools; one of my own colleagues had to forcefully resist bolting for the exits hand over mouth. Yet Boyle films the moment steadily and unexploitively He looks but he doesnt dwell. (That said theres one moment in Ralstons improvised amputation that takes literal nerve on everybodys part director actor subject and audience.)The scene appalls but doesnt offend; its a ""Worst-Case-Scenario Survival Handbook nightmare that resonates on the metaphysical level. ""127 Hours understands what Ralston had to sacrifice to the gods of mischance -- the price he paid for the hubris of going into the desert solo -- and by all accounts Ralston understood it as well. The movie ends with a burst of pealing majestic Sigur Ros on the soundtrack and a religious vision of surpassing ordinariness. Sartre had it wrong says ""127 Hours.

"127 Hours review film examines internal and external journeys |       NJ.com comments 127 Hours review film examines internal and external journeys Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05 2010 at 809 AM View/Post Comments Chuck Zlotnick/Courtesy Fox Searchlight/MCT James Franco plays a solo hiker who finds himself wedged in a narrow desert canyon in ""127 Hours."" Every season or so a movie comes along -- ""The Perfect Storm"" ""Into the Wild"" -- thats billed as a thrilling story of man vs. nature. But honestly the good ones are never really about that. Theyre about man vs. himself. In the grueling -- and based-on-a-true-story -- ""127 Hours"" James Franco goes off into the Utah wilderness. He takes a few spills off his bike he flirts with two cute backpackers and then he takes a solitary hike. And promptly gets himself wedged immovably in a crevasse with a small boulder pinning his arm. He has no friends to call out to. He has no phone to signal for help. All he has is a single bottle of water a few ready-to-eat meals and a knock-off Leatherman knife. Now what? Well what comes first is that he has to realize that its not nature he has to fight now. Its himself. Or more specifically all those parts of himself that want him to scream to panic to just give up. Movie Review 127 Hours (R) Fox Searchlight (93 in.) Directed by Danny Boyle. With James Franco. Now playing in New York; scheduled to open in New Jersey Nov. 19 Ratings note The film contains graphic violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys review THREE STARS ""127 Hours"" is directed by Danny Boyle and while it has some of his signature love of colorfully tricky cinematography and cutting-edge (and bleeding-ear) music its a big change from his last movie the Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire."" That movie was set in one of the most crowded slums on earth. This one is set in a vast wilderness. That one was about how one mans life touched so many experiences. This is about a man whos always chosen to be alone -- and now finds it to be his curse. Some of those metaphors feel forced particularly as Franco talks to himself and to us about how this particular predicament has been waiting for him all his life. He always wanted to push people away? Great. It worked. And hows he feel about that now? This feels a bit too neat. Just as Francos many daydreams -- including one near ""Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" fantasy -- feel less like a deepening of the material than a way to stretch a one-hour National Geographic special into a feature-length film. Chuck ZlotnickJames Franco Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn in ""127 Hours."" But Franco -- who is having a bit of a moment this year having excelled in ""Howl"" and survived ""Eat Pray Love"" -- is never less than watchable as Aron the extreme explorer. And Boyles style is never less than energizing as it manages to keep this incredibly cramped space interesting. (The film would make a good double feature with ""Buried."") The constant hallucinations get a little boring (not least because they themselves arent all that interesting). And audiences who fled ""Slumdog Millionaire"" during the latrine scene should be warned that Francos eventual escape involves a dull knife and a lot of gore. But for all that this is still a triumphant story. Not of how one person conquered nature though. But of how he conquered himself.

(Opulence Studios) Joe Neumaier Friday November 5 2010 400 AM Title 127 Hours A hiker gets trapped in a gorge. With James Franco. Director Danny Boyle (133). R Gore language. At Lincoln Square 12 Sunshine Cinema.The appeal of the grisly but gripping ""127 Hours"" isnt watching James Franco as a hiker named Aron Ralston find hope in a hopeless situation. Thats par for the course in a drama like this which is a cross between ""Castaway"" and ""Into the Wild."" No the kick is in watching Franco think his way out of a deadly place and into just a really bad place.In Francos hands Ralston is a prime mover always running this way and that. During an excursion in 2003 Ralston a 27-year-old Coloradan goes rock-climbing in Bluejohn Canyon near a national park in Utah. He befriends two pretty fellow hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) but after frolicking in a lake Ralston heads off on his own not telling the girls or anyone else where hes headed.He winds up miles away in a narrow passage; a hefty rock suddenly falls on his right arm pinning him to a wall. Ralston stunned slowly assesses the situation cataloguing his tools and storing up his water supply. He makes videos for his family while trying to save himself until after five days he faces a grim choice either use a small knife to cut off his stuck limb or wind up dead.Director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"" ""28 Days Later"") makes the movie kinetic from the start often using split screen and putting the camera inside Ralstons water jug next to his feet and eventually inside his head as his mental compass spins wildly. Its exciting but gimmicky and can sometimes seem empty.But once Francos on his own everything is played across this terrific actors deceptively goofy face. Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoys script (from Ralstons book) keeps the hikers pre-calamity life on the periphery which is fine; as Franco goes from fearful to resigned to resentful of the spot hes in were absolutely hooked.

Photo Fox Searchlight / Everett Collec Director Danny Boyle (left) and star James Franco on the set of ""127 hours."" James Franco gives the performance of his career in Danny Boyles spellbinding treatment of the real-life survivor story of Aron Ralston. (ASSOCIATED PRESS) True-life tales of survival are a dime a dozen on TV these days but Ive never seen one anything remotely like Danny Boyles dazzling and utterly riveting ""127 Hours"" which takes you deep inside the mind of a young man struggling to free himself from a remote Utah cavern. Back in 2004 extreme athlete Aron Ralston -- played in an Oscar-friendly tour de force by James Franco -- was trapped when his hand was crushed under a boulder in a hiking accident. Its only fair to warn you -- and this is not really a spoiler -- that its clear almost from the outset that Ralstons only way out is going to require cutting off the now-useless limb. Having performed that duty Id recommend you stop reading now and head for the nearest theater to experience this movie without any other previous knowledge. If you need more convincing I have to report that Ralston in deep denial about the situation (he will pass through all the other stages of grief along the way) tries to free himself by chipping at the boulder then tries using an ingeniously deployed series of ropes and pulleys. Ralston abandons an early stab at limb removal because hes equipped only with a cheap dull blade -- and focuses on more immediate problems like the cold and a very limited supply of food and water. Like all great movies ""127 Hours"" takes us on a memorable journey. Which is not easy when 90 percent of the movie takes place with a virtually immobile hero in a very cramped setting. Boyle who directed the Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" suffuses this film with remarkable energy and visual inventiveness. Ralstons nimble mind toggles between memories dreams and ever-elaborate delusions. Im not going to describe these except to note that after seeing this youre likely not going to think of Scooby-Doo in the same way ever again. Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara turn up in the first 10 minutes as hikers who Ralston guides to an underground lake. There are also very brief glimpses of his friends and family -- most recognizably Treat Williams as his father and Clemence Poesy as the ex-girlfriend he remembers spending the night with. But for the bulk of the film Ralston is utterly totally alone alternately cursing and mocking his fate -- not to mention his selfish refusal to tell anyone where he was going. He uses a camcorder to record a diary -- a useful device for eloquent and moving soliloquies about just how far his pursuit of thrills has isolated him from humanity -- and ruefully funny gallows humor. As my colleague Kyle Smith noted recently on his blog the screenplay by Boyle and his ""Slumdog"" collaborator Simon Beaufoy specifically omits the conversations with God or prayers if you like that Ralston mentions in the memoir -- ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" -- that the movie is based on. But theres a palpable spirituality suffusing Francos fine performance -- when Ralston finally emerges from the cavern with a beatific look on his face its clear this young man found a new appreciation for life. Nothing that Franco has done before will prepare you for his work here. Stunningly photographed by Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak -- who repeatedly contrast the claustrophobic cavern and the gorgeous sweeping vistas outside -- ""127 Hours"" is easily one of the years best movies. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bachelorette star found dead off Southern Calif. highway Read Next Bachelorette star found dead off Southern Calif. highway Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 47897 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 22877 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 18677 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 4 2010 649 PM Hacker The horror of self-amputation in Danny Boyles 127 Hours.

You can also download the program  here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed  via iTunes  or directly with our  RSS feed. 127 Hours Danny Boyles 127 Hours (Fox Searchlight) departs from the same premise as the first Saw movie.  Instead of two mens ankles chained by a murderer we have one mans arm trapped by a fallen rock and instead of Saws titular tool we have a cheap Chinese pocketknife. But the sickening claustrophobic central dilemma is the same The protagonists have been stranded in hell by a force beyond their control and if they want to get out alive they had better get to hackin. Of course Saw and 127 Hours are films with completely different aesthetic and moral aims Saw sought to frighten and shock its audience while 127 Hours seeks to ... actually Im not sure what Boyle is trying to do here. Uplift and inspire? Yes by moments. Gross us out? In at least two long sequences oh God yes. Show off? Definitely. Boyles signature quality as a director is his intensity. His flashy polychromatic pop-music-crammed style is often praised as ""kinetic"" but it can also feel simply busy which is not the mood you want when trying to re-create five days of soul-searing isolation and silence. Unlike a horror movie 127 Hours cant take advantage of narrative suspense based as it is on a well-known true story In 2003 28-year-old Aron Ralston (James Franco) while hiking alone in Utah was pinned against a canyon wall when a boulder came loose and crushed his right arm. After five days a dehydrated and delirious Ralston managed to amputate his own arm below the elbow rappel down a 100-foot drop and hike out of the canyon. Severing a part of ones own body with a dull knife while fully conscious is an image thats difficult to dwell on for even a second and Boyle clearly relishes the chance to make us contemplate the act from every conceivable angle for 95 full minutes. How much time would go by before you seriously began to consider amputation as a possibility? How would you go about doing it? How long would the severing itself take? Its not that the director is a sadist exactly--hes just keen to experiment with extreme sensations like a teenager with a bottle of pilfered vodka and a bungee cord. Advertisement Except for a brief opening act in which Aron flirts with two girls he meets on the trail (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) and a very short coda in which hes found by some hikers and airlifted to safety we spend every second of the movie trapped in that canyon with him. There are flashbacks as Aron remembers the family he loves and may never see again but theyre fleeting and fragmentary enough that we never experience the relief of even a brief respite. We always remain aware were in Arons head especially since whenever Aron himself appears in a hallucination Boyle makes the smart choice of using a stand-in for Franco. As for James Franco himself Ive long considered him one of Americas natural wonders. In lieu of choosing the career path his movie-star looks entitle him to--doe-eyed romantic lead buff action hero--Franco has become a real movie star taking on roles that pose daunting technical challenges and if this performance isnt quite the tour de force that his Allen Ginsberg was in Howl its only because the character of Aron Ralston--a laconic charmer unwilling to accept his own human limitations--seems closer to Francos real-life self than a gay beat poet. Boyles last film Slumdog Millionaire had its hero running fighting and Bollywood-style dancing through the slums of Mumbai India with Anthony Dod Mantles nimble camera in tow. 127 Hours takes place in a space about five feet square but Mantle is still there and his camera almost as active. It frames Francos face in tight close-up as he screams for help then pulls up out of the crevasse and into the sky to reveal the vast stretch of empty silent desert that surrounds him. This is one moment when the jittery camerawork is effective but its power is weakened by the fact that nearly every scene contains an equally gimmicky shot. Boyles use of sound is similarly maximalist Sometimes its ironic and almost lighthearted as when Aron embarks on a new day of fruitless attempts to dislodge the crushing boulder to the sound of the 70s soul hit ""Lovely Day."" Later when the shit hits the fan and the serious arm-sawing begins A.R. Rahmans percussive string-heavy score sounds like a horror-movie soundtrack. Advertisement I cant tell you much about how sound and image worked together in that amputation scene because honestly I watched that part through intermittently covered eyes. When the film played at Telluride there were reportedly audience members who needed medical attention  and I can understand why Almost despite myself--indeed as I continued to assess Boyles aesthetic choices dispassionately--the close-ups of a human being butchering his own limb like a leg of lamb made me feel icy-hot and clammy as if I might pass out. (The cucumber-cool social columnist seated to my left seemed amused.) Boyles skill at wringing physical and emotional reactions from his audience is impressive; watching 127 Hours is as intended an experience of grueling intensity. But in the end Boyles maximalist approach has a boy-who-cried-wolf effect; a day after seeing this movie I remembered only the peak sensations not the storys emotional trajectory and certainly not the moral lessons (which as far as I can tell are pretty much reducible to ""When you go on a hiking trip leave a note""). 127 Hours wants to tell the story of a thrill-seeking adventurer forced to go on a wrenching inward journey but the movie itself is an extreme athlete incapable of keeping quiet or sitting still.

"Movie review 127 Hours - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Aron RalstonMovie review 127 HoursDirector Danny Boyle and star James Franco draw us into an agonizing unforgettable and ultimately uplifting tale of wilderness survival.November 05 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic There is such a tangible life force pulsing through ""127 Hours"" that it is almost impossible not to be drawn down into Blue John Canyon alongside its star James Franco for the real-life ordeal of Aron Ralston a solo hiker trapped in a remote area of Utahs Canyonlands National Park. Once there with the hikers right arm hopelessly pinned by an 800-pound boulder director Danny Boyle wrings you out completely with a film so emotionally and intellectually involving that when the horrific last resort finally arrives it leaves some moviegoers in a faint. And everyone else wondering Could I possibly do that? Based on the five days in April 2003 that the 26-year-old outdoorsman found himself ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" as Ralston called his bestselling memoir this is a classic tale of man versus nature and the extreme measures sometimes necessary to survive. As is the case in stories like these a whether on the peaks of Everest or in the depths of a Chilean mine a it is the face-off against unimaginable odds the test of the human spirit as much as the outcome that provides the intrigue. Boyle understands that. As he did in his Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" whose hero faced an unrelenting string of soul-destroying challenges the director again proves a master at balancing escalating tension with just-in-time release. Here the balloon almost almost almost pops. The films penultimate moment and the one already generating a public stir for its graphic depiction of the way in which Ralston finally frees himself in a bone-snapping bloody self-amputation is only a riveting few minutes and a powerful affirmation of the ""less is more"" precept. In Franco the filmmaker has the perfect partner in crime. Had the actor slipped along the way the film would have immediately lost traction since he must spend the bulk of it nearly immobile. In a smart move designed to deal with shooting in the cramped confines of the canyon and one that paid off Boyle used two cinematographers a Anthony Dod Mantle who worked with the director on ""Slumdog"" and Enrique Chediak ( ""Charlie St. Cloud"" ""The Good Girl"") a equipped with three types of cameras to get the effect he wanted. Franco began this very good year at Sundance exploring the provocative soul of beat poet Allen Ginsberg in ""Howl"" a far more intellectual exercise that ranged from smoky nightclubs to courtrooms then followed as Julie Roberts younger lover in ""Eat Pray Love"" with a stint on ""General Hospital"" and an excursion into performance art thrown in just to keep things interesting. In contrast ""127 Hours"" is a nearly solitary tour de force as Franco moves through the various emotional and physical states that desperate straits churn up with such a naturalistic ease it gives the film a documentary feel. It helps that Ralston was an amateur videographer who recorded daily updates on his efforts to escape his ricocheting emotions and his final wishes. Boyle adopts that as a storytelling device lending an intimacy to the film that would otherwise have been difficult to achieve. Some of the funniest and most wrenching moments come as Franco plays to that very small screen leaving us to watch a film within a film and making an already surreal experience even more so. This life-altering saga starts innocently enough with the hiker taking off on a spur-of-the-moment trip in the Utah desert. In the first of many twists of fate he doesnt leave word with anyone about where he is headed so no one knows where to start looking when they finally figure out hes probably in trouble. Rather than foreshadowing the coming doom the filmmakers infuse the opening sequence with the heady sense of excitement and risk that define this outdoorsmans way of embracing life. Using a split-screen effect that evokes a slot machine spin images of Ralston biking in a beautifully stark desert spin one way while on either side are shots of jammed football stadiums marathoners in a starting-line crush packed subways and crowded city sidewalks. Its all set to Bill Withers exuberant ""Lovely Day."" Point made. Then the fateful hike begins. Boyle soon seeds in one of the central metaphors that will define the film a water or really life-saving liquid of any sort a with Ralston greedily guzzling his very limited supply. It is here that the filmmaker takes the liberty to weave fiction with fact for dramatic effect. There are deep pools of water for diving in which Ralston does with Kristi ( Kate Mara) and Megan ( Amber Tamblyn) a couple of hikers he bumps into not long before the accident. Beer and soda being iced down for the party hes missing have never looked more thirst-quenching; rain sometimes soft sometimes in torrents is never more welcome. By the time we hit the shot of a bottle of Gatorade that was left in the back of Ralstons truck it takes everything not to run out of the theater to buy some. The other metaphor being worked over is humanity itself. For all the time this loner has spent escaping into the wilderness to prove how self-sufficient he is it is his thoughts of family friends lovers the son he still might one day have that sustain him. These come in a vivid stream of imagination set pieces that provide escape from the canyon a for both us and Ralston a when things get too grim. In the end ""127 Hours"" is one mans incredible unforgettable journey; it took the extraordinary alchemy of Boyle and Franco to also make it ours. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFor Danny Boyle and company much more than 127 Hours of...October 24 2010Grateful Climber Describes His Amputation OrdealMay 9 2003Ranger Awed by Hikers Will to LiveMay 4 2003Trapped Hiker Had One Way Out -- With His KnifeMay 3 2003MORE STORIES ABOUTAron RalstonSmart MoveCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-127-hours-20101105,0,5546405.story",200,127hours20,127hours,latimes

Share Tweet Based on Aron Ralstons book Between A Rock And A Hard Place 127 Hours chronicles the five days Ralston spent with his arm pinned underneath a boulder during a solo rock-climbing expedition gone wrong. Its a survivalist tale naturally but also a more far-reaching assessment of life and death as the situation forces Ralston to ruminate about his family his ex-girlfriend and the hereafter often in a hallucinatory rush of panic and half-sleep. Hot off Slumdog Millionaire director Danny Boyle would seem like the perfect man for the material because if theres a common denominator to his work since Trainspotting its his ability to bottle the caffeinated energy of youth. The setting may seem constricting but Boyle captures the intensity of Ralstons experience in a swift agonizing defiantly cinematic 90 minutes. But intensity is one thing; depth is another. Boyle succeeds best at the bookends before and after Ralston winds up in this predicament. James Franco plays Ralston as a confident carefree thrill-seeker who ventures out to Bluejohn Canyon Utah for a rock-climbing weekend alone. Not telling anyone where hes going is part of the point; real freedom means getting a clean break from civilization and the burdens of family friends and other responsibilities. So when he gets stuck under a rock in a deep crevasse Ralston cant expect anyone to come to his rescue. All he has for survival are a bottle of water a little food and a dull penknife for when things get really desperate. The money scene in 127 Hours has the intended visceral impact and its a credit to Boyle that he doesnt flinch from the terrible reality of what Ralston had to do to extricate himself. Yet Boyles restless style works against him much of the time too. The constant barrage of flashbacks takes away from the grim march of time; Ralston was stuck in one place for five days but the film makes that period feel much shorter. Worse still all that introspection adds up to a disappointingly shallow accumulation of regrets and life lessons none of them surprising. After the adrenaline rush 127 Hours turns to vapor.

Danny Boyles film--based on the story of Aron Ralston who in 2003 cut off his own arm after being stuck for five days under a rock in a Utah canyon--is a one-man show. Watch what Franco--actor/sleepy grad student/tepid writer/sometimes-funny viral video comedian/unsurprising conceptual artist/enthusiastic scholar of queer theory/aficionado of gender fuckery--can accomplish when he actually focuses for a couple of weeks.Once the boulder drops about 20 minutes into the movie and the title appears on the screen like a punchline were stuck in that canyon with Franco. Were as dependent on him for our moviegoing survival as Ralston is on his dwindling supply of water. At first this means enduring long sequences of frantic failure as he tries to lift the boulder push the boulder pull himself free straining mightily the whole time. (If anyone ever greenlights Constipation The Movie Francos got his audition tape ready.) So unbearable is his futility that when Ralston manages the small triumph of picking up a dropped knife with a twig Francos exultant ""Sweet"" is both mordantly funny and legitimately inspiring.That scene is emblematic of much of 127 Hours which for most of its middle section is a portrait of American ingenuity with Francos likable practical performance at its heart. Hell get to the arm-sawing sure but first Ralston--once an engineer--devises with the limited tools available to him clever systems of survival and he hopes mechanisms of freedom. He wraps himself in ropes and a bandanna as the nighttime temperature drops into the 40s. He pees into his CamelBak just in case. Soon hes assembled a complicated pulley system with which he hopes to pull the boulder off himself. All the while Ralston narrates his predicament into the video camera hes brought along a filmmaking device that seems awfully blunt at first but becomes a fascinating window into how a smart funny non-action-hero guy might behave as he tries to think his way out of a catastrophe.Soon enough were navigating through Ralstons head and the descent into thirsty delirium begins. ""Dont lose it"" he commands himself but he does and his hallucinations and memories--including one jolting cameo from Scooby-Doo--are visceral and affecting. Unlike Boyles last movie the flashback-dependent Slumdog Millionaire were not meant to draw explicit lines from the past to the present--theres no scene of a young Aron Ralston like learning to tie a double overhand stopper knot. Instead the glimpses of his past build an impressionistic picture of a young man so devoted to the pursuit of experience that he has left human connection behind. He built his life in solitary and having never bothered to tell anyone where he was going is paying the price now.As Boyles film flits from the real world--the heavy reality of a man in a canyon pinned near death--to the world of dreams and delusions so Francos performance transforms encompassing both universes. In the films final act hes a man in the throes of panic dying of thirst but dreaming of drowning. When the time comes for his final stab at freedom he summons not just the courage and physical strength to saw off his arm but also the last vestiges of his practical former self to work out just how to do it.About that sequence Its kind of amazing. It is really gory and funny and compelling with sound effects cannily standing in for pain. Despite including several horrible steps you probably havent even imagined its over quick--but youd be excused for thinking it takes forever.The image that will stick with you though is not the dull blade slicing through flesh but James Franco eyes wild slippery knife held firm in his mouth as he tightens his tourniquet his cheeks smeared red with blood. Its a vision of ecstatic violence that brought to my mind with equal parts sadness and excitement Heath Ledger as the Joker. With this smartly chosen intuitively delivered performance Franco is assuming the role previously filled by that risk-taking actor the serious sex symbol for the thinking movie fan.And its fitting and fascinating that its this movie that will likely earn Franco-- dilettante enigma artistic adventurer--movie-star status. The film that may turn him once and for all into an unapproachable celebrity whose awards-season prospects may force him to abandon his extracurriculars from now until February is itself a passionate bloody argument for engagement with the world.

"127 Hours | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 127-hours ) 127 Hours (United States/United Kingdom 2010) November 01 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Danny Boyle doesnt believe in doing the same thing twice. After the rousing success of the romantic fantasy Slumdog Millionaire he has switched not only gears but continents to tell the true story of Aron Ralston in 127 Hours an ""action film with a guy who cant move."" The films similarities to Buried are striking in that both movies rely primarily on the performance of the lead actor and both challenge the audiences stamina to stay with a character under trying circumstances for 90 minutes. The level of tension in 127 Hours does not reach the intense level achieved by Buried but it contains a scene so disturbing in its blistering realistic gore that some will be forced to turn away. 127 Hours is unflinching in its depiction of what constitutes the ""will to live."" The rest of this review assumes that the reader is at least cursorily familiar with the real life story of Aron Ralston whose ordeal was the subject of numerous news stories in May 2003 (as well as subsequent network TV and cable documentaries). Those who dont recognize Ralstons name and/or dont recall the news reports may find my discussion of the film to be highly ""spoiler-ish."" As is suggested by the title 127 Hours covers a period slightly longer than five days lasting from the end of April to the beginning of May 2003. Maverick adventurer Aron Ralston (James Franco) 27 years old at the time ventures into Utahs Blue John Canyon to do a little climbing and exploring. The films first fifteen minutes which are bright and colorful with glorious landscape shots accompanied by A. R. Rahmans throbbing score serve the dual purpose of introducing us to the cocky main character and showing off the setting. Aron encounters a pair of lost female hikers (played by Amber Tamblin and Kate Mara in what amount to cameos) and helps them find their way to their destination before he continues on his own. Its not long however before a mishap results in him tumbling down a shaft and becoming trapped at the bottom when a boulder crushes his arm against a tunnel wall and becomes lodged there. He tries everything within his power to free himself but the tools at his disposal are limited. As his supply of water dwindles Aron realizes he may die here. As with Buried 127 Hours remains with the protagonist for the entire running time never flashing to scenes of concerned friends or relatives wondering where their loved one is. There are a few brief flashbacks early during Arons ordeal and as dehydration and fatigue begin to take their toll on his mental state he experiences dreams and hallucinations. The film attempting to get into the characters mindset represents these as parts of a half-crazed reality. Aron who has a camcorder with him records a video diary of some of his thoughts and experiences with the hope that whoever finds his body will return it to his parents. (In real life the videotape exists. Although it has never been shown publicly Ralston allowed Boyle and Franco to view it as part of their preparation for making the movie. That along with interviews and his autobiographical book about the experience provides the narratives basis.) James Franco who is on screen for nearly every frame of the film (often in close-up) gives the performance of a lifetime overturning his reputation as a dramatic lightweight. He carries the movie. For more than an hour were down in a hole with Aron and the tautness and intensity of Francos performance keeps us engaged. Its his interpretation of the character that gets us to the point where we understand why Aron chose the path of self-amputation as the sole route of survival. Needless to say that scene is difficult to watch and Boyle doesnt truncate it turn the camera away or do anything to lessen its impact. We see Aron break both bones of his forearm then use the dull penknife of a cheap multi-utility tool to saw away at the soft tissue. Its a bloody and unpleasant scene. There have been walkouts at some screenings and many have closed their eyes or turned away. Although less gruesome than the goriest images in some horror movies the ""reality"" of this scene makes it more difficult to watch (in much the same way that its almost impossible to view a fingernail be ripped off in a motion picture even though its a relatively simple special effect). Although 127 Hours bears little resemblance to Slumdog Millionaire it is made by largely the same crew. Boyle wrote the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy. Anthony Dod Mantle did some of the camerawork. And A.R. Rahman the famous Indian composer wrote the score. Its a testimony to the talents of these men that if not revealed one would not guess the connection between the films. Boyle succeeds in documenting Arons ordeal and in chronicling the difficulties he faced while in the hole wild extremes in temperature physical and mental fatigue numerous failed attempts to free himself and the anguish of waiting for death. His eventual act was part courage and part desperation and many viewers will wonder (while hoping never to have to learn the answer) if they could do something equally extreme in a similar situation. The movie tosses in a little philosophy (about predestination) that doesnt resonate and some black comedy that does. One thing almost entirely absent (at least for those who know the basics of the story) is suspense. Not only do we know that Aron is going to survive but were aware of how hes going to do it. So watching 127 Hours becomes not an exercise in finding out how things end but in studying the details of what went on during those five long days. Labeling the movie as a ""thriller"" or an ""action"" film could be deemed misleading because of this. Regardless Boyle has made a singularly intense motion picture that tells in narrative form the same tale that has been related in TV documentaries. This is a fascinating story of determination and survival that deserves to be told. It is ultimately uplifting but its tough going to get to that point. 127 Hours (United States/United Kingdom 2010) Director Danny Boyle Cast James Franco Screenplay Danny Boyle amp; Simon Beaufoy based on the book Between a Rock and a Hard Place by Aron Ralston Cinematography Enrique Chediak Anthony Dod Mantle Music A.R.Rahman U.S. Distributor Fox Searchlight Run Time 134 U.S. Release Date 2010-11-05 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Sexual Content) Genre THRILLER Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Jaws (1975) Pulp Fiction (1994) Casablanca (1943) worse movies of this genre Neon Demon The (2016) Left Behind (2014) Jade (1995) Three...better movies of James Franco Milk (2008) Spider-Man (2002) Spider-Man 2 (2004) worse movies of James Franco Nights in Rodanthe (2008) Eat Pray Love (2010) Spider-Man 3 (2007) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2206,200,127hours27,127hours,reelviews

Boyle is the floridly intense pop-poetic stylist who made Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting and though it would be accurate to call him a fabulist here in a change of pace he summons all of his visual zap to tell the story of what happened to Aron Ralston a 27-year-old hiker as authentically as possible. The trick of the movie (which comes out Nov. 5) is that it knows that the real adventure is whats going on in Arons head. On a Friday night in April 2003 Aron (James Franco) a carefree bohemian jock out for pleasure but a bit of a loner leaves his home in Aspen Colo. to indulge in his favorite ritual of escape driving out to the miles and miles of fabulous twisty red-rock formations that make up Canyonlands National Park in Utah -- the ultimate adult jungle gym. He goes there to get high on the landscape a sun-baked piece of geological sculpture so full of hidden claustrophobic passageways that it suggests a Road Runner cartoon as designed by Antoni Gaudi. And he goes there to get high on himself. Boyles split-screen images have a surreal clarity linked to Arons childlike ""Oh wow"" gaze. Yet Aron a veteran climber is so cocky about his expertise that his skill shades off into recklessness. When he meets a pair of attractive hikers (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara) who could use a tour guide he leads them to a sandwiched-in cliff then has them all slide down to an underground hot spring. They seem to have found paradise (for Aron its a heavenly chance to show off) but theres a slightly threatening undertow to his bravura. Is he transcending danger or courting it? We find out soon enough when Aron on his own again (the way he seems to like it) falls through an ancient crack in the earth and a boulder tumbles right on top of him. He winds up wedged between two chalkstone walls the boulder having lodged itself with a kind of horrific granite permanence against his crushed right arm. Forty feet below the canyon surface his legs a-dangle his cries for help unheeded hes literally caught between a rock and a hard place. Since the real Aron Ralston wrote a book called Between a Rock and a Hard Place about his experience then became a public figure on talk shows you may go into 127 Hours knowing exactly what he did to survive. Yet in no way does that diminish the films psychological suspense its feverish drama of one dude trying to edge his way out of an abyss. 127 Hours is as gripping a tale of stranded ingenuity as Cast Away as Aron works to save himself by adjusting to his new reality. He grinds away at the boulder with a cheap pocket knife then drops it aghast and picks it up with his toes; he comes to rely on the 15 minutes of sunlight that brush the wall at 930 a.m. And he keeps himself chipper by rambling a diary of his experience into a camcorder. His words amount to a ruefully snarky monologue of fate from a member of a generation baptized in irony and Franco in a tour de force uses those words to capture Arons ordeal from the outside in. With his toothy slightly dazed beach-bum confidence the actor takes us through the Five Stages of Survival detachment jokes rage revelation and doing-what-you-gotta-do. He gets us rooting for his bluster under pressure. Here as in Trainspotting Boyle proves a master of altered states. Once Aron realizes that hes not getting (or going) anywhere he begins to descend into fantasy (theres a trippy montage of soft-drink ads when hes thirsty). And what he comes to see in a delirium of enlightenment is that his trapped state is what hes been running from his whole life. That boulder was waiting for him. 127 Hours offers a daunting challenge to a filmmaker How do you rivet an audience when your protagonist cant even move? The answer is that theres an awesome freedom to Danny Boyles filmmaking. And freedom too is the theme of the movie. Aron may be pinned but his soul gets unlocked and when he finally faces up to what he has to do hes not just cutting off his trapped appendage. Hes cutting off the part of himself that was only pretending to be alive. 127 Hours is a salute to do-it-yourself existential bravery and an ingeniously crafted one but what makes it cathartic is that its about a guy who gets high by taking the ultimate plunge.

Its ostensible subject is Aron Ralston the outdoorsman trapped in a Utah canyon by a falling boulder that pinned his right hand and forearm to the red rock.But the true subjects of Boyles film starring James Franco as Aron are many. They include the pleasures of solitude the afflictions of the solitary the Sisyphean challenge of a hump-busting ordeal and that transcendent moment of deliverance. Its a coming-of-age story - blunt mythic gut-wrenching.It takes a particular talent to build an action movie around a static figure literally stuck between rock and hard place. Boyle has the gift. He harnesses A.R. Rahmans music and Glenn Freemantles sound design to Francos electricity to at least 127 camera angles (superbly edited by Jon Harris) to create a propulsive sense of movement.It is not for the squeamish. It takes a greater degree of intestinal fortitude than I possess. In the films penultimate scene as Ralston amputates his own forearm I watched through fingers fanned in front of eyes.But though Aron ever tests himself Boyle does not test the audience. He does his darnedest to make the movie experience into an experience experience. And he succeeds. Everything about the bravura filmmaking and performance is designed to put us into Arons hiking boots head and body and make us feel his exhilaration as well as his delirium of fear and hope.In the films opening scenes Aron is (literally) a freewheeling thrill-seeker cycling recklessly through Canyonlands National Park unshakably fearless and self-reliant. He is a creature of movement conqueror of ancient rock kingdoms privy to the secrets of this mystical corner of Utah.When he meets two pretty hikers he shows them how to shimmy between the voluptuous lips of a crevasse and drop into a canyon pool. The girls are interested. But Arons drawn to nature; human nature not so much. The girls go on their way and leave Aron alone in his happy place.By this time Franco has so powerfully conveyed Arons soaring energy that when the rock pins him in the canyon its like seeing Niagara evaporate.When the film forcefully pulls back from glorious external Utah vistas to the even rockier landscape of Arons inner life it is no less breathtaking.The loner has told no one where hes gone neglected to answer his moms many telephone calls and failed to pack his rucksack for an emergency. But he has resources more sustaining than a PowerBar more infinite than Canyonlands. Arons hunger for human connection and his imagination pull him - and us - through. Not just literally does 127 Hours get out of the canyon and take us to a higher place.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

The Globe and Mail Published Saturday Sep. 18 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 23 2012 423PM EDT Comments Print /License AA The following short reviews of some of the films screening on Saturday Sept. 18 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival are by James Adams James Bradshaw Guy Dixon Rick Groen Liam Lacey Gayle MacDonald Dave McGinn J. Kelly Nestruck Johanna Schneller and Brad Wheeler. The star ratings are out of four. 127 Hours Danny Boyle (USA) 4 STARS The Oscar-winning directors film is based on the true story of Aron Ralston an avid outdoorsman who has a freak accident and finds himself trapped in a deep crevasse his right hand crushed under a boulder in the canyons around Moab Utah. In the hands of a less skilled craftsman the story - one man little dialogue in a crammed space - could have been a snore. But with the same deft touch sensitivity rapid-fire editing and superb score he brought to Slumdog Millionaire Boyle turns the near-death tale into a riveting re-enactment that will keep audiences squirming in their seats. James Franco gives a brilliant nuanced performance as Ralston a young man who tries every means at his disposal to move the rock before he makes the one decisive act - the self-amputation of his own forearm - to get back to the family he loves. G.M. Sept. 18 6 p.m. Bell Lightbox 1 Henrys Crime Malcolm Venville (USA) 2 STARS Henry (Keanu Reeves) lives a dull life. He works as a highway toll-booth operator in Buffalo. He stares blankly at everything even when his wife raises the idea of having a baby. So when he is sent to prison for a bank robbery he did not commit Henry sees it as an escape. While Henry is in prison his cellmate Max (James Caan) convinces him that ""if youve done the time you might as well do the crime."" Henry leaves jail intent on robbing the bank with Maxs help. He is now a man with a purpose. But when Henry meets an amateur actress played by Vera Farmiga and soon begins acting alongside her in a Chekhov play he must choose between following through on his plan or following his heart. As a heist movie that is also a romantic comedy Henrys Crime fails at both with little tension to the robbery and few laughs throughout. It will leave you with the same blank stare Henry comes home from work with. D.M. Sept. 18 530 p.m. Varsity 8 Cave of Forgotten Dreams Werner Herzog (USA) 3 STARS Hidden in a limestone cliff in the south of France lies the rarest oldest possibly most intellectually fascinating artwork ever found. Werner Herzog took a camera crew equipped with 3-D cameras into the heavily protected Chauvet Cave which contains what is believed to be the oldest cave paintings drawn some 35000 years ago. Because of the caves delicate environment no other film crew is expected to be allowed in again. Part documentary part scientific footage Herzogs film lingers on the mesmerizing drawings produced incredibly when prehistoric animals still roamed the Earth and Neanderthals were still a competing human species. A historic invaluable film. G.D. Sept. 18 9 p.m. Bell Lightbox 1 The Promise The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town Thom Zimny (USA) 3 STARS Using unearthed footage from recording sessions and home rehearsals from 1976-78 as well as new interviews the making of Bruce Springsteens raw-powered album Darkness on the Edge of Town is explored in depth. Starting with a lawsuit that delayed the sessions and continuing with Springsteens unwavering pursuit for the albums lean hardened sound Darkness was epic in its making if not in its result. Where 1975s grander Born to Run celebrated escape and youthful abandon Darkness had Springsteen dealing with the limitations of adulthood. With an unvarnished illuminating film on the creative process of an iconic artist director Zimny matches his subjects dogged focus. B.W. Sept. 18 630 p.m. and 845 p.m. Scotiabank 1 Im Still Here Casey Affleck (USA) 1 STAR For an hour and a half or so Casey Afflecks experimental ""documentary"" on his brother-in-law Joaquin Phoenixs apparent breakdown manages to keep the viewer trying to follow this ontological shell game Whats real? Whats pretend? Purportedly this is a documentary following Phoenixs decision to quit acting and become a rapper as he goes through a drug-assisted mental breakdown. Or is it possibly an Andy Kaufman-like performance-art piece in which the actor pretended to become unhinged as a demonstration of our toxic and dehumanizing celebrity culture? On the reality side Phoenix seems genuinely messed up and most of the movie involves a series of awkward encounters between him and people who arent sure how to act. Evidence of fakery includes selectively blurry shots actors cast in some roles and Phoenix and Affleck credited as writers. Verdict? Possibly its a whole new genre - the focumentary. L.L.

Every year the Telluride Film Festival pits the movies against the mountains--how much time do you want to spend sitting in the dark when you can be out on the town surrounded to the point of besiegement by the splendor of the Rockies? This year the little town was especially seductive what with cloudless skies by day a bedazzlement of stars by night and at an altitude of almost two miles mountain air as fragrant as it was thin. Yet the movies won by a landslide. The program of films old and new was so rich and remarkably varied that the festivals screens opened windows to a greater world. Watch a clip from the Israeli documentary ""Precious Life."" Video courtesy Origami Entertainment and Bleiberg Entertainment. Of the mainstream features on display the hands-down standout was ""The Kings Speech"" with Colin Firth as King George VI--the father of Queen Elizabeth II--and Geoffrey Rush as a raffish Australian speech therapist who treats the kings paralyzing stutter. Its a rare combination of crowd-pleaser and triumphant artistry and Ill have more to say about it later. Before that though comes the first of my adventures at Telluride last week--sitting in the dark for five and a half hours (with one short break around the four-hour mark) to watch ""Carlos."" ENLARGE Geoffrey Rush stars in The Kings Speech. Weinstein Company This epic achievement by Olivier Assayas (he made last years exquisite ""Summer Hours"") stars the Venezuelan actor Edgar Ramirez who gives a commanding performance as the international terrorist of the 1970s and early 80s. Technically speaking ""Carlos"" is a miniseries. Shot on a TV budget in an astonishingly short 91 days the production debuts next month on the Sundance Channel. Its unclear how many people will be able to see it as I did in a packed theater on a big screen. But nothing Ive encountered on any size screen matches the lucidity of this fact-based fiction--it amounts to a textbook on state-sponsored terrorism--and nothing Ive seen in recent years has held my attention so relentlessly. Not a single squirm in those first four hours--the last section is a bit of a letdown--or a single sag in the action ""Carlos"" also stood as a textbook case of the total immersion that one can enjoy only in a theatrical setting. ENLARGE Colin Firth as King George VI in The Kings Speech. Weinstein Company Another film an Israeli documentary called ""Precious Life"" may or may not get wide distribution in theaters; if it doesnt moviegoers will be deprived of an enthralling experience. Its the story of a Palestinian baby named Muhammad who was born in Gaza three years ago with a severe immune deficiency then treated in Israel by Israeli doctors. I approached this one skeptically because of a tangential connection to its subject matter. Back in the 70s I wrote ""The Boy in the Plastic Bubble"" a TV movie of the week about a similar case that emerged from the network process with a high sugar content. Would ""Precious Life"" be similarly sentimental? Not for a moment. The brilliance of this feature-length debut by a veteran Israeli journalist Shlomi Eldar lies in its tough-mindedness. When Muhammads mother Raida cautiously hints at her hostile feelings toward Israel and Jews Mr. Eldar never flinches from bringing them out into the open however stunning they prove to be. Indeed the dramatic center moves from the baby to the mother and the evolution of her feelings is so surprising and so stirring as to hold out symbolic hope for eventual peace between Israelis and Palestinians. As of now the only thing I can imagine standing in the way of an Oscar for ""Precious Life"" is peace breaking out before the ballots go in the mail. ENLARGE A scene from Of Gods and Men. Sony Pictures Classics A superb and austere drama in French and Arabic ""Of Gods and Men"" won this years Grand Jury Prize at Cannes. At Telluride it served as a companion piece to ""Precious Life"" even though the two films could hardly be more different stylistically. ""Of Gods and Men"" which was directed by Xavier Beauvois and photographed by Caroline Champetier is set in a village in North Africa. It tells in fictional terms the true story of a small brotherhood of French monks whose lives were threatened by Islamic extremists during the Algerian civil war of the 90s. Here the message of hope and reconciliation comes amidst brutally harsh events but its expressed with heart-stopping eloquence by Lambert Wilsons Brother Christian who embraces Islam in the spirit of Christianity. The incomparable Michael Lonsdale plays Brother Luc a physician who cares for the villages people and whose love of life--and good wine and Tchaikovskys ""Swan Lake""--prompts a scene of celebration that is nothing less than sublime. Watch a scene from Of Gods and Men. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures. The Tchaikovsky ballet also provides the framework for Darren Aronofskys psychological thriller ""Black Swan."" Natalie Portman stars as Nina a rigidly perfectionist ballerina trying to distinguish between reality and her delusions as she closes in on her goal of dancing ""Swan Lake"" at Lincoln Center. Its perfectly possible to tire of the directors gothic-horror tropes and the scripts psychological banalities--I certainly did--without ever losing sight of Miss Portmans wonderful performance or the scariness of Barbara Hershey as Ninas madly ambitious mother. Telluride has more distinctions than spectacular scenery. Since the festival doesnt give prizes it isnt overrun with industrial prize-seekers. Since its loyal patrons prize a sense of history the festivals programmers always come up with older films or downright old ones that could not otherwise be seen outside of university archives. One of this years rediscoveries--or rather discoveries since it was seen by next to no one at the time--was Stanton Kayes 1968 ""Brandy in the Wilderness"" a pioneering application of cinema verite techniques to autobiography in a diary form. The Brandy of the title played by Michaux ""Brandy"" French is the filmmakers wistful girlfriend a lost soul who wants to make a movie about her life. But the filmmaker who also plays himself--his nom decran is Simon--seems no less lost. The complex stuff of this seemingly simple film is his gradual self-discovery. Film history can be a tough sell these days at film schools where students often resist watching anything in black-and-white let alone the fragile treasures of the silent era. At this years festival though substantial audiences turned out to see such silents as ""Chicago"" and ""Rotaie."" The former a satirical melodrama with Phyllis Haver as the murderous Roxie Hart was directed by Cecil B. DeMille though he declined to take credit for it. The latter directed by Mario Camerini was the last silent film produced in Italy and a masterpiece thats been all but forgotten. If I needed a reminder of how affecting silent films can be it came in the films opening sequence when a man and a woman slowly make their way down a dark street to a small hotel take a drab room and sit apart from one another in mysterious melancholic silence. ""The Illusionist"" embodies melancholy in its figure of an aging magician with a dwindling bag of tricks. This delicate--and sometimes tentative--animated feature was made by Sylvain Chomet who won an Oscar nomination for his beautiful first feature ""The Triplets of Belleville""; he worked from a script that the late Jacques Tati wrote for a live-action film that was never shot. Its one of several small special pleasures that include two firsts ""The First Movie"" an endearing documentary by Mark Cousins about movies and the power of imagination among young kids in Kurdish Iraq and ""The First Grader"" an enjoyable if manipulative fiction film based on the saga of an octogenarian Kenyan farmer who entered elementary school so he could learn to read Naomie Harris is lovely as the old mans impassioned teacher. I was strongly impressed by a first feature from Romania Florin Serbans ""If I Want to Whistle I Whistle."" The young hero Silviu will be released from a juvenile detention center in nine days but thats longer than he can wait to save his younger brother from the clutches of their selfish mother. At the outset Silviu seems explosive and inarticulate. When an explosion is triggered by more stress than his psyche can bear his eloquence is startling yet still unequal to the task of explaining himself to a warden whos decent enough but unequal to the task of understanding. ENLARGE James Franco as Aron Ralston in 127 Hours. FOX Searchlight Two years ago Danny Boyle caused a Telluride sensation with the first public showing of ""Slumdog Millionaire."" This year the English filmmaker was back with ""127 Hours"" a stunner of another sort that stars James Franco. The script was adapted from ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" Aron Ralstons remarkable narrative of his entrapment in a Utah canyon wall during the course of a solitary day hike and his amputation of his right forearm to set himself free. An inevitable question is whether the movie is completely unsparing in its climactic details. The answer is not completely though a couple of men passed out at one screening. Another question is whether the filmmaker and his star have managed to transcend the visual and dramatic limits of what would seem to be a singularly confining story. The answer to that is a resounding yes. Mr. Franco is simply terrific and Mr. Boyles trademark exuberance creates a dizzying succession of images that get the movie not only out of the canyon but into its heros mind. Mr. Ralston attended the festival. Hes personable and articulate and I talked to him at a postscreening party. In response to my gingerly query he said watching the film had been extremely painful for him and his family. Then he grinned at the director who was standing with us and said ""But isnt it great how Danny brought in some of the horror techniques he used in 28 Days Later?"" You cant stop a movie lover from loving movies. My own movie love found its ideal object in ""The Kings Speech"" which was directed by Tom Hooper from a script by David Seidler and which I saw under ideal circumstances--no knowledge of what it was about thus no specific expectations although only an idiot would expect little from a film starring two such virtuosi as Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. In fact the story it tells with surpassing wit and grace has been known only to scholars and historians since it unfolded in 1930s England prior to World War II; thats partly why the period drama seems so marvelously new. The main source of its vitality however is the electrifying counterpoint between Mr. Firths magnificently tortured monarch and Mr. Rushs deliciously irreverent therapist (who broaches profound emotional issues without ever letting on that theyre psychological). After a mostly drab summer at the multiplexes heres a film that makes your spirit soar.

TWITTER Two years ago Danny Boyle held the first public screening of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" at the Telluride Film Festival. The rest as they say is history. Boyle was determined to complete his new film ""127 Hours"" in time for this years festival and it premiered to loud ovations -- and a few squeals of terror -- during the weekend. Boyle knew he had a narrow window of opportunity to take advantage of the worldwide success of Slumdog and he decided to tackle a risky piece of material inspired by Aron Ralstons ordeal when he was trapped in a narrow canyon in 2003. This film has disturbingly graphic images and it presents another challenge for audiences in that for most of the movie we are confined in the canyon with just one actor the remarkable James Franco. But Boyle is such a gifted director that he overcomes the obstacles and might even match the commercial success of his earlier Oscar winner. Boyle assembled many of the people who worked with him on Slumdog including screenwriter Simon Beaufoy producer Christian Colson composer A.R. Rahman and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (who shares credit with Enrique Chediak). Maybe its the comfort of the collaboration that helps account for the apparent effortlessness of the filmmaking. The film opens with a bang with lots of split-screen effects and speeded-up digital images as Aron heads off for a trip through Canyonland National Park in Utah. Boyle has demonstrated visual razzle dazzle and kinetic editing since his early films Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. Here the style is meant to mirror the energetic personality of the protagonist an adrenaline junkie who savors adventure and shares his infectious enthusiasm with anyone he meets. Aron encounters two girls while hiking in Utah and immediately goads them into climbing across a steep ledge and diving into a crystal-blue lake. We share the rush that the characters feel but we also feel a sense of impending danger. The clock stops when Aron leaves the girls and begins climbing down a canyon. Suddenly he dislodges a boulder that pins his arm and traps him. From here the film moves into a more interior mode though it maintains energy by drifting in and out of Arons memories and fantasies. Boyle takes advantage of the beauty of the setting familiar from many John Ford Westerns but he also captures the inner life of the character. He is aided enormously by Franco who pulls off a virtual one-man show. The actor already has demonstrated tremendous versatility and just this year viewers have seen him as one of Julia Roberts lovers in Eat Pray Love and as Beat poet Allen Ginsberg in Howl. Here he manages to create a radically different character -- an extroverted adventurer who is forced to turn reflective. Expect Oscar to come calling next year. The different moods Aron experiences point to the deeper themes of the film. 127 Hours is a pointed double-edged critique of masculinity. Aron was reckless enough to embark on this climbing expedition without telling anyone where he was going and the film sees that his cocky independent spirit gives him unusual survival skills. But that lone-wolf mentality also puts him in deadly peril and the scream that he utters near the end of the film -- ""I need help"" -- gives voice to his belated awareness of the inadequacy of the Wild West code of self-reliance that stunts so many men. Franco nails this key moment with rare emotional intensity. Although Ralstons ordeal gripped the world seven years ago there was no guarantee that a film would do justice to the chilling true story. All of the key creative personnel contribute to the movies nail-biting tension and unexpectedly moving finale. Jon Harriss editing is matchless and Rahmans score effectively heightens the emotion. Ultimately however it is the talents of Boyle and Franco that sock this movie home.

Danny Boyle has taken us to the surface of the sun (""Sunshine"") and the end of the world as we know it (""28 Days Later"") testing the limits of human endurance with each radically different project. ""127 Hours"" takes the adrenaline rush one step further pitting man against nature in the most elemental of struggles as Boyle compresses the true story of rock-climbing junkie Aron Ralston who spent five days wrestling with a boulder after a rockslide pinned his arm against a canyon wall into an intense 93 minutes. Marketed correctly pic should spell another hit for the high-energy helmer. On paper ""127 Hours"" would seem to buck convention on multiple fronts The film revolves around a single actor (James Franco) stuck in one location (""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" to borrow the title of Ralstons memoir) for most of its running time and though it packs an uplifting ending that emotional victory comes at the expense of the heros right arm -- depicted in a gruesome climax that caused a number of people to faint at the films premiere in Telluride (located just three hours from Bluejohn Canyon Utah where the events took place). Blatantly noncommercial elements aside Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy (""Slumdog Millionaire"") have managed to craft quite an accessible film after all opening up the action with a sexy prologue featuring two lost hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn whose carefree early scenes would feel right at home in Boyles ""The Beach"") and using several hallucinatory visions drawn directly from Ralstons book all the better to re-create his frame of mind at the time -- a task that relies on two cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak to achieve the films gorgeous supersaturated look. While Franco can sometimes be a wild card getting increasingly self-conscious with recent roles (most notably his guest-starring stunt on ""General Hospital"") his take on Ralston feels both credible and compelling; few actors could have made us care so much or disappeared so completely into the role. With very little time to establish the young mans backstory Franco uses his Method acting technique to slip into Ralstons skin making it that much easier for us to vicariously do the same. We ""get"" him instantly thanks in part to an energetic opening montage spread across three rapidly changing screens and cut to Free Bloods ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" that places the young engineering students interest in the outdoors within the broader American phenomenon of extreme sports. Ralston may be rather reckless flipping his bike and so forth on his way to the canyon but he knows what hes doing and the accident wasnt necessarily his fault While he was testing his weight on a loose chockstone the rock gave way and crushed him beneath it. Over the course of the next hour Ralston will cycle through all five stages of grief (with ""acceptance"" ultimately being the decision to remove his arm) while making room for some serious soul-searching. Ralston replays memories of his family an intimate night shared with g.f. Megan (Clemence Poesy) and his eventual breakup -- all serving to interrupt the monotony of dehydration and helplessness. As the days pass his visions become more vivid and abstract -- one day he hosts an unsettling gameshow-like monologue with himself complete with laugh track the next he dreams of a harrowing flash flood -- before culminating in a fateful premonition. Just as director Rodrigo Cortes did in the recent stuck-in-a-coffin thriller ""Buried"" Boyle constantly repositions the camera to help dispel the potential claustrophobia of it all sometimes pulling weird trick shots (such as the straws-eye view of Ralstons dwindling water supply). Since the real Ralston brought a camcorder along on the hike the film treats some of the footage as if the character were documenting the situation himself letting the writers get away with a fair amount of explanatory dialogue along with the occasional tension-breaking one-liner. As nerve-racking as the whole predicament is its surprising how much humor manages to sneak in with A.R. Rahmans Western-sounding synthpop score building from tension to ultimate triumph (with a boost from the original Dido collaboration ""If I Rise""). Many will come out of sheer curiosity about Ralstons self-administered amputation (whether or not they manage to keep their eyes open during the scene itself) but the scenes that follow are even more effective right up to the closing images of the real Ralston still chasing the adrenaline dream. 127 HoursProductionA Fox Searchlight release presented with Pathe of a Cloud Eight/Decibel Films/Darlow Smithson production in association with Everest Entertainment Dune Entertainment Down Prods.
