Sheesh His buddies arent exactly having a ball either. Freshly married Frank (Ferrell) is itching to misbehave and electronics store owner Beanie (Vaughn) thinks responsibility is what happens to the unlucky guys - and he should know. Wouldnt it be cool decide the trio if they formed a fraternity. You know with parties ritual initiation goonery and none of the seminars. But theres a catch the villainous dean of their new school is out to spoil their fun. Director Phillips (Road Trip) confesses to frat membership in his youth and even made a documentary on the subject. So why is this not funnier or more outrageous? Sure theres humiliating mischief and the girlfriends blowjob class is some kind of gory highlight. But no ones heart seems to be in the enterprise.

Slickly made diverting albeit unmemorable effort from director Todd Phillips and his co-scenarist Scot Armstrong isnt half so fresh or funny as their prior feature ""Road Trip."" Still its lively and different enough from concurrent releases to score just as well with the same demographic. This article was corrected on Feb. 13 2003. A comedy about grown-ups pitched at auds young enough to think college is a nonstop party youd never want to end ""Old School"" is this years kinder gentler ""Animal House"" -- as if anyone needed ""Animal House"" to be kind or gentle. Slickly made diverting albeit unmemorable effort from director Todd Phillips and his co-scenarist Scot Armstrong isnt half so fresh or funny as their prior feature ""Road Trip."" Still its lively and different enough from concurrent releases to score just as well with the same demographic with some crossover to twenty- and thirtysomethings. Prologue has realtor Mitch (Luke Wilson) returning early from a miserable days business travel only to find live-in girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) engaged with two undressed blindfolded playmates. He moves out -- into a rental home just off-campus in the town where his college buds Frank (Will Farrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) still live. Beanie whos got a wife and kids but suffers from a serious case of bachelor-days nostalgia decides the new house will be Party Central -- and since hes owner of an audio-equipment chain the massive kickoff fest manages to get Snoop Dogg and crew as its ""house band."" Frank meanwhile is newly wed to Marissa (Perrey Reeves). She graciously allows him a ""boys night out"" then is mortified when the notorious ""Frank the Tank"" of yore -- who emerges like a John Belushi Dr. Jekyll after a copious amount of brewskis- is spotted streaking down Main Street. This bacchanal attracts the attention of the male trios former teasing target Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) whos now the universitys Dean. Intending to get the juvenile grownups thrown out he has the house re-zoned as campus housing. However Beanie finds a loophole -- theyll start their own fraternity. Craving quiet rather than collective madness after his recent spousal trauma Mitch is a reluctant joiner. But hes already got Frank as a housemate -Marissa having given him the boot -- so why not. As pledges are put through hazing paces the ""frats"" anything-goes reputation (complete with KY-jelly topless wrestling contests) spreads like wildfire a fact that does not aid Mitchs earnest romantic pursuit of Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) a divorcee hed had a crush on years earlier. Meanwhile Pritchard uses increasingly underhanded means in trying to shut the house down. Pic lacks cumulative momentum or any especially hilarious setpieces to this point. But laugh quotient does jump a few notches with a climax that has the fraternity brothers forced to prove themselves worthy before an evaluation board -- including debating against surprise guest James Carville -- before a final confrontation with the vengeful Pritchard. Compared with the clever situations and sunny attitude of ""Road Trip"" ""Old School"" is less imaginative and more forced -- the attempts to feign depth via semi-serious narrative developments especially in Mitchs dealings with Nicole come off half-baked and unnecessary. Ample chances to lampoon aspects of college and civilian life are seldom taken. Script lacks verbal wit with rote substitution of cusswords (not to mention a few dismaying homophobic jokes). Nor are lead characters as idiosyncratically defined as one might like though all are well played Wilsons protag is pretty much your basic Nice Guy while the mix of misogyny and middle-class dad in Vaughns figure is pushed just far enough to be slightly creepy but not far enough to be a wellspring of outre humor. The reliably funny Farrells periodic party-monster outbursts amuse though hes had better material. Piven makes a dull villain (wheres ""Rock n Roll High Schools"" Mary Woronov when you need her?). In addition to Carville and Snoop there are middling cameos by ""Road Trip"" vets Andy Dick and Seann William Scott. Nonetheless ""Old School"" is better paced and more brightly mounted than most youth-skewed comedies of late. Phillips knows how to make an audience feel like its having a good time a knack missing from most such efforts since well ""Road Trip."" As in that pic soundtracked song choices are well above average in terms of variety and ironic kick with particular nods toward such chestnuts as Kansas ""Dust in the Wind"" and Simon amp; Garfunkels ""Sounds of Silence."" Tech contribs are all solid. Old SchoolProductionA DreamWorks release of a Montecito Picture Co. production. Produced by Daniel Goldberg Joe Medjuck Todd Phillips.

Will Ferrell with a little help from his friends reverts to the raucous behavior of his frat-house days in Old School. In lieu of a toga party one scene treats us to an octogenarian fraternity member wrestling two topless townie lookers slathered in KY Gel. Hey theres no stopping progress. Director Todd Phillips and co-writer Scot Armstrong have followed up Road Trip with a college-town farce thats on the slightly high side of boilerplate. Lead Luke Wilson is affably low-key while Vince Vaughn is funnier than he sometimes is. And Will Ferrell who rounds out their frat-house triumvirate takes to his drunken streaking scene down the communitys main drag with what looks like telltale zest. Review of the movie Old School ( out of four) Stars Luke Wilson Will Ferrell Vince Vaughn Jeremy Piven Ellen Pompeo Juliette Lewis Director Todd Phillips Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for some strong sexual content nudity and language Opens Friday nationwide If the leads sound a little ripe for a frat comedy this is the point. Married Vaughn newly married Ferrell and newly unattached Wilson turn Wilsons new digs into a fraternity house to escape a zoning clause that would otherwise enable the unctuous college dean (Jeremy Piven) to shut it down. They stock it with students and non (including the octogenarian) and steadfastly refuse to have anything to do with the school. Its all just an excuse to have parties and even Snoop Dogg himself shows up to entertain at the first one. The movie is so loosely structured that even James Carville shows up in one scene. As a result the throwaway bits (a wedding singer warbling obscenities a deliciously nasty gag during the end credits) tend to be good for guffaws in a way the overall movie is not. During the parts that fizzle maybe you can take the time to ponder what Phillips and Armstrong possibly will attempt in their upcoming movie of Starsky and Hutch. Like all DreamWorks releases Old School begins with the little kid dropping his fishing line off a crescent moon. If theres only paltry poundage on his catch this time out an energetic cast and moderate pacing skills are worth something. Unlike most of the lowbrow comedies in theaters these days this one isnt quite a carp.

Directed by Todd Phillips from a screenplay by Phillips and Scot Armstrong. 91 minutes. Rated R for some strong sexual content nudity and language. Several theaters. Let us ponder the vision of a naked Will Ferrell jogging purposefully through the night streets of a quiet college town his rear end glowing white like a jiggly beacon. Or if youd rather not ponder it dont go see ""Old School"" in which the nude Ferrell -- who could well be the man for whom the phrase ""sorry ass"" was invented -- is used as a visual punch line. Once seen its an image difficult to erase from memory -- and believe me Im trying. Naked former ""Saturday Night Live"" cast members aside ""Old School"" delivers on what its ubiquitous commercials promise a predictable for-the-boys comedy that does contain a few genuine laughs (not to mention a very funny reference to ""The Graduate""). Not quite enough to justify giving this movie 91 minutes of your life but as stupid gross-out comedies go you could do worse. The storys a sort of older version of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" meets ""Animal House"" with a slight twist Three 30-ish buddies frustrated by their nowhere lives and the women who seemingly control them form a fraternity on their old college campus. Others join them including a handful of college-age kids (brought in presumably to attract a younger movie audience) and the parties hazing and wrestling topless females in KY Jelly begin. When a college administrator (Jeremy Piven) tries to put a stop to the fraternity the guys must prove their mettle in a series of intellectual and physical challenges which is a polite way of saying that Ferrell does some really dopey rhythmic gymnastics and that Piven looks annoyed a lot. Luke Wilson Owens cute but less-funny brother stars as the cheerfully bland Mitch a regular guy blindsided by the infidelity of his adventurous girlfriend (Juliette Lewis sucking on cigarettes as if theyre popsicles). Hes given a less-dangerous-looking love interest Ellen Pompeo (""Moonlight Mile"") she of the curly smile and Renee Zellweger-like crinkly voice who wanders aimlessly but pleasantly through the movie. The screenwriters could have saved time by putting her in a T-shirt that read ""Nice Unthreatening Woman Dont Be Afraid."" Really the unspoken subtext of ""Old School"" is anxiety -- about women about commitment about settling for a mundane life about becoming dismembered (and I use the term quite precisely) when a fraternity prank involving rope and concrete blocks goes horribly wrong. But its not meant to be examined seriously; this throwaway movie with its oddball cameos (among them Snoop Dogg Andy Dick and Democrat pundit James Carville who must be hard up for a gig these days) and fat-kid sight gags is only after a laugh. And if that comes in the guise of Ferrells pasty posterior -- well in these dark days a laugh is still a laugh.

Starring Luke Wilson Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. Directed by Todd Phillips. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The saving grace of ""Old School"" is that it has about a dozen funny moments. These moments arent mildly funny or chuckle funny but really funny infused with the same coarse go-for-broke sensibility that director Todd Phillips demonstrated in his first feature ""Road Trip."" Theres nothing PG-13 about Phillips who appears himself in one scene uttering a single line ""Im here for the gang bang."" That says it all -- the terrain the audacity and ultimately the limits of ""Old School"" which despite the big laughs barely holds together in between. The problem isnt only that its story is weak; its tedious as well. Phillips whose professional calling card was a documentary about college fraternities (""Frat House"") returns to the subject in this story of a 30-year- old guy named Mitch (Luke Wilson) who rents a house close to a college campus. When the house is rezoned as coming within campus property Mitch has to relocate but his buddies have a better idea start a fraternity. They do with a membership made up of students and desperate guys in their 30s. Vince Vaughn in a role similar to the one he played in Jon Favreaus ""Made "" is the mastermind behind this and Will Ferrell plays another friend whose dim-witted diffidence disappears as soon as he starts drinking. There are scenes of wild parties and Ferrell is given a bit too much latitude to incarnate the spirit of John Belushi but sometimes it works. The scene in which he bursts naked and drunk into a performance by Snoop Dogg is a highlight. Whats missing is a reason to keep watching. Our hero Mitch doesnt care much about the fraternity and neither do we. When we meet him he is trying to recover from a disastrous breakup with a promiscuous girlfriend (Juliette Lewis in a satisfying cameo). He spends much of the rest of the movie mooning after an old high school crush Nicole -- played by Ellen Pompeo whose blond squinty sexiness is not unlike Rene Zellwegers. Mitch wants to pursue a romantic course and the movie wants to go there too but Phillips seems at a loss. He offers instead boring complications involving the fraternitys charter as if anyone cares. Only the certainty of more laughs around the corner keeps viewers in their seats. - This film contains strong language and gross sexual humor.

"CNN.com - Review Old School fails the test - Feb. 20 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review Old School fails the test Not even worth the old college try By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Will Ferrell Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn in ""Old School."" Story Tools RELATED  EW.com Review Old School (CNN) -- ""Old School"" gets old -- real fast. In this attempt at a comedy Luke Wilson Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn play a trio of 30-something buddies who have the worst cases of arrested development in the history of Western civilization. The idiotic premise of this film has these three supposedly adult men trying to recapture the irrepressible fun of their college years by starting their own off-campus fraternity. If youre not already running to the nearest cineplex consider this There are two -- not just one -- two nude scenes featuring Ferrell and as a bonus a third scene with him wearing only a pair of tight white briefs. Now thats entertainment. Ferrells character Frank has just gotten married but cant even spell ""commitment."" Vaughns character Beanie is a wannabe hustler with a wife kids and a store called Speaker City. Wilsons character the mild-mannered Mitch has just discovered his live-in girlfriend played by Juliette Lewis in a mercifully small part is into group sex when hes out of town on business. Suddenly out on the street Mitch decides to rent a house near a local college campus. The second buddy-boy Beanie sees the house he hatches a plan to turn the place into a fraternity thereby insuring that Mitch will meet lots of single girls. The solution to all their problems seems to be diving back into adolescence complete with a beer blast (featuring an improbable performance by Snoop Doggy Dogg) and plenty of underage coeds. A hodgepodge of a muddle of a mess Will Ferrell enjoys a drink in ""Old School."" Once the boys get set up in their den of iniquity they recruit a pledge class full of boozers and losers including a 90-year-old man a couple of complete nerds a grossly overweight black guy and whoever else that Central Casting sent over that day. Obviously comedy is suppose to arise out of this situation. This isnt a movie its a high-concept oil slick. ""Old School"" is brought to us by the same ""creative"" team which gave us that other ode to diminished brain cells ""Road Trip."" Director/producer/screenwriter Todd Phillips and his co-writer Scot Armstrong have once again lowered the threshhold for entertainment. In addition proving that you cant go home again this limp noodle of a movie is executive produced by Ivan Reitman who produced ""National Lampoons Animal House"" back in 1978. Also in the cast is Jeremy Piven as Gordon Pritchard the dean of the university. Somehow in this muddled mess the fraternity has been sanctioned by the school and now Pritchard has to figure out a way to get rid of them. Some of the most ludicrous scenes in this ludicrous film take place with the ""boys"" trying to qualify to stay on campus. Other cameo appearances include a very scary Andy Dick as a character you dont even want to know about and Craig Kilborn playing a obnoxious jerk -- proving once again that typecasting still works. ""Old School"" doesnt even deserve to go to video and DVD. This film should go straight to landfill.

On ""Saturday Night Live"" he went about as far as the network censors would allow squeezing his wobbly Jell-O-y self into teeny thongs whenever possible. But in this sloppy slaphappy production - a variation on all boys-will-be-jerks frat-house comedies throughout recorded history - he spends long long minutes with cheeks to the wind. Ferrell plays Frank newly married to a controlling wifey (Perrey Reeves) and trying unsuccessfully to pose as an adult. In fact hes longing for the old days of streaking glugging and horndogging with his equally undersocialized friends Mitch (Luke Wilson) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn). All three thirtysomething men have female troubles - women are if not the enemy then at least the mystery meat - so the lads decide to roll back the clock to a time when burping bonging and banging were de rigueur They start a new college fraternity. Cowriter-director Todd Phillips (""Road Trip"") first attracted attention with his buzz-of-Sundance 1998 controversial documentary ""Frat House"" and he no doubt mines that research here. More practically though he draws on the alumnus expertise of executive producer Ivan Reitman from whose ""National Lampoons Animal House"" all frat-prank movies flow. Under Reitmans deanship Ferrell lets his freak flag fly and Vaughn unlooses a notably funny light-on-his-feet lunkheadedness as a successful entrepreneur leashed by a wife (Leah Remini) and kids. Wilson meanwhile though not an especially impish house brother is nevertheless treated to a fine frowsy turn by the always surprising Juliette Lewis as a fiancee who ends up having a sexual appetite no simple frat boy could ever sate.

"Old School | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; old-school ) Old School (United States 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Old School is exactly what director Todd Phillips intends for it to be low-brow moronic to a fault and occasionally side-splittingly funny. I laughed aloud seven or eight times during this film and smiled or chuckled on a few additional occasions. Admittedly considering the bawdy brainless nature of the humor there were times when I was almost embarrassed to be laughing but that didnt stop me. In an era when a viewer is lucky to find one or two humorous moments during the course of a 90-minute so-called ""comedy"" Old School delivers with surprising effectiveness. Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) is an average middle-class guy whose life is thrown into a tailspin when he discovers that his live-in girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) is into an alternative lifestyle that involves multiple partners. Fleeing his broken relationship Mitch moves into a low-rent house on the outskirts of nearby Harrison University. Egged on by his best friends Frank (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) Mitch turns his new digs into a fraternity house for anyone who wants to pledge a young old student non-student. Mitchs house is soon the most popular place on campus which leads the straitlaced vindictive dean (Jeremy Piven) to begin a campaign to close it down. Luke Wilson an adept low-key comic performer manages to keep his dignity throughout the proceedings which is something of an accomplishment. His character gets to have some fun such as sleeping with 24s Elisha Cuthbert (playing a girl who looks older than the age on her drivers license). Dignified is not a word to describe Will Ferrell whose most memorable moment occurs when Frank is drunk and buck naked. Vince Vaughns usual stiffness isnt a distraction; hes in his element. Supporting players include a priggish Jeremy Piven; Ellen Pompeo (the only good thing about Moonlight Mile) as Mitchs would-be love interest; TV talk show host Craig Kilborn; and Juliette Lewis who is mercifully in only a few short scenes. The span of topics for Old Schools jokes doesnt range far and wide. Nearly every gag (and certainly every one that works) involves sex nudity drinking male stupidity or some combination of the above. (Plus theres an unforgettable rendition of ""Total Eclipse of the Heart"" featuring somea| shall we saya| ""alternative"" lyrics.) Like Phillips earlier effort Road Trip and older antecedents along the lines of Animal House Old School cares little for providing a cohesive narrative or presenting characters. These things are inconsequential devices to move from one joke to the next. If the viewers intention is to have a few laughs this movie gets a passing grade. If youre looking for a more complete cinematic experience Old School has a few too many absences.
