Ill say that for The Strangers the latest film (after Michael Hanekes Funny Games) to suggest that owning a placid country home isnt all its cut out to be. Neither is this unambiguously drecky film a horror-flick retread with nothing to recommend it outside its ripeness for mockery. Which is considerable. Just to clarify By ""unambiguously drecky"" I mean ""horrible beyond question"" and ""not open to debate"" -- that is even viewers who disagree with me on every movie will agree with me on this one. If youre one of those viewers and right now youre muttering to yourself ""Hnnh that Biancolli chick hates everything I like so no matter what she says I am so plunking down money on The Strangers because I just know Im gonna love it"" then dear reader you are deluding yourself. Consider yourself warned. The Strangers is supposedly a thriller. It is supposedly scary. Written and directed by newcomer and Texas product Bryan Bertino it concerns a handsome young couple who are inexplicably terrorized by a bunch of strangers in masks and it is supposedly inspired by ""true events."" Freaky no? Good premise for a minimalist chiller yes? Sure but its only a premise. Normally movies also provide 1.) characters and 2.) plot going that extra mile for audiences in search of diversion. Bertinos film provides neither. Instead it provides a few moronic reels of victims screaming crying and scuttling in and out of the house while three masked sociopaths stand around staring at them. The victims are tearful Kristen (Liv Tyler) and morose James (Scott Speedman) who arrive after a long night at a wedding reception where he popped the question and she said no. Its 4 a.m. and theyre both miserable. She mopes. He drinks. After a while they kiss and make up. But then theres a knock on the door Its a woman in shadows asking for someone who isnt there. Odd. A little while later theres another knock on the door then another. And then the masked sociopaths begin to materialize popping up in gotcha shots at windows and shadowed doorways and a backyard swingset and Kristen goes into hysterics while James stupidly wanders around outside. Their attempts at survival are so pathetic and misguided that the best part of the movie for me was the running commentary voiced by a woman seated behind me. (""Oh God thats a bad place to sit"" and ""Shes got a paring knife? Jeez"") We never learn much about the lead characters. We know nothing about James except he loves Kristen has a friend named Mike and lied about hunting with his dad. We know nothing about Kristen except she doesnt want to get married. As for Those Strangers all we know is that one wears a sack on his head (""Thats a stupid mask"") and two are women in kewpie-doll get-ups. Theyre creepy-looking -- Ill grant you that -- and they make lots of eerie thudding and scraping noises. They also have a preternatural gift for stealing and disabling telecommunications devices and once they get their hands on that ax hanging in the shed the ham radio is toast. But there are continuity errors. There are confusing edits. There is a weak almost wordless script that gives the villains little to do but loom spookily until the revolting finish and there is absolutely positively no suspense at all just sudden money shots designed to goose us out of our seats. Before it even starts Bertino tells us how it ends in an intro that claims the details of that fateful night are ""still not known"" which portends something less than happily-ever-after for the witnesses. But no matter what happens to Kristen and James at least they dont have to sit through 85 minutes in a darkened theater with The Strangers. It might be short but its painful. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mainstays No Tools 6-Cube Storage Shelf for 20 + pickup at...

Rogue Pictures hide caption toggle caption Rogue Pictures The Strangers Director Bryan BertinoGenre HorrorRunning Time 90 minutes Watch a Clip Put yourself in James shoes Youve gone to an isolated cabin with your girlfriend (Liv Tyler) right after shes turned down your wedding proposal presumably so that the two of you can spend the evening in tears together. You hear a knock at the door at 4 a.m. and the knocker gives both of you the willies -- so much so that your girlfriend wants a cigarette so you drive off to buy some leaving her there alone. (Are James shoes feeling uncomfortable yet?) The knocker comes back and starts really freaking your girlfriend out -- in a mask yet -- so she calls you. You dash back but decide shes being silly and youre going to stay there for the night rather than just driving away. (Shoes really pinching now right?) At which point bad things happen. And still you stay. And worse things happen. And the two of you are drawn closer together by all this. OK kick off those shoes Does any of this sound remotely plausible? Suspenseful? Intriguing? Well in the event its only the last of those things -- and only insofar as it raises questions about what possessed Liv Tyler to take a role in this sadistic unmotivated home-invasion flick.

And the chilling atmosphere. And the in teresting actors. And the ghosts. What are we left with? How about ""The Sucking""? If this review makes it to 500 words - a finish line that looms impossibly distant given how little there is to say about this nonstory - itll be as long as the script for ""The Strangers."" The film which is ""inspired by true events"" (i.e. ""made-up"") consists of 20 minutes of a drippy couple (Liv Tyler Scott Speedman) heaving sighs around a quiet night at an isolated country house (he wants to get married; she doesnt) until they spend an hour getting menaced by masked figures. This middle section - by far the best part - will thrill those who have seen one or fewer horror movies what with the way the actors inch around the (EEEEP) house clutching (AIEEEI) knives while hooded (AWWWK) stalkers seep into the background to blasts of aural scream-cues. I thought Id guessed the twist but I was wrong. All the hooded figures I assumed are just the guy in disguise - the Speedman character who disappears for long stretches. He has two possible motives He could be a psycho who actually wants to terrorize the girl for refusing him. Or he might hope to change her mind about his worth by pretending to be a hero and rescuing her from himself - though of course she would wind up outsmarting and stabbing him then taking off his mask to shock us all. The bad movie in my head was far better than the one on-screen which offers no twists at all. A twist? There isnt even a curl or a bend. Ancient Indian cemetery? Nope. Satanic cult? Negative. Deep-rooted moral failing comes back to do its ironic worst on someone? Nay. There are masked weirdos scuttling out of the paneling and thats it. Its obvious from the time you buy your ticket that this is a movie about whether Tyler gets killed. So while we wait does she devise a brilliant counterattack? Is she an experimental physicist who knows how to run a wire into that puddle so that anyone who steps in it will be fricasseed? No but she can cower and run shrieking through the yard. Her boyfriend is even dumber punting a chance to call 911 and managing not to realize that - if you have a shotgun - getting into a cozy barricade would be wiser than say stumbling around in the inky night. Various delaying gags come in on loan from the Overlook Hotel. Theres a radio that may not work a potential rescuer of the Scatman Crothers variety and a red word scribbled with redrum-esque fever on the windows ""Hello."" So we know this about the Strangers They can afford lipstick. They also torch a gas-guzzling car but that seems no more than a reasonable protest of the price of unleaded. Is that 500 words yet? kyle.smithnypost.com THE STRANGERSLiv it alone.Running time 90 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence). At the Magic Johnson the 84th Street the Orpheum others.

May 30 2008 (out of 4)Starring Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler. Written and directed by Bryan Bertino. 95 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowTo call The Strangers a movie is really stretching the definition of the word. With no plot to speak of no character development whatsoever no theme and precious little intrigue what we have here is simply a pileup of effects. And not especially special effects. There is not even an ending to give away. For the soundtrack some well-worn spooky creaking knocking walking noises and ominous random sounds (one incongruously resembling distant helicopters circling) of the sort you can download free from the Internet. For music a couple of lousy songs (the rights must have come cheap). For horrifying sights some familiar devices a man in a gunny sack with holes poked through it for eyes and ears and two females disguised with plastic masquerade dolls faces employed as always to scare the bejesus out of us the way clowns can frighten young children. The pacing is of the sort gauged to heighten adrenalin but the scare tactics are so obvious they could hardly raise a heartbeat. Liv Tyler who stars as Kristen could use some good screen time. She hasnt been seen in anything significant since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Perhaps thats why she went for the bee-stung lips treatment (they look like a prosthesis) - to be sure wed remember her.Scott Speedman plays Kristens depressed and rejected boyfriend James. His movie career could use a little lift too but taking a part in The Strangers might just have the opposite effect. The story such as it is is delivered in Morse code. If you cant figure out the signals youll never understand the background to the scary situation not that it really matters. Apparently its this the couple have attended a wedding where James has proposed to Kristen. She has seemingly turned him down. They drive in silence and inner turmoil to a suburban home surrounded by woods; its the ranch-style house where James grew up.James answers Kristins need for cigarettes and blithely walks out to the car leaving his jilter alone in a strange house.The fright begins the moment that Kristen is on her own with a loud knock on the wooden double doors. Right on cue and according to horror flick formula she goes straight for the door and opens it. Telephones are discarded or stolen. A teenage girl with long blond hair (we never get a glimpse of actual faces) says shes looking for ""Tamara."" And the fun begins.Bryan Bertino who has made the leap to writer/director from gaffer and electrician suffers from nostalgia for the 70s. The pacing the decor the LPs on the endlessly running old turntable (cliche alert) and especially the spooky nature of the home invasion all belong to an era when Stephen King and Brian De Palma ruled and movies such as Carrie The Omen Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Jaws defined the horror genre. Too bad that Bertino is no Stephen King. But not to worry the filmmaker is up-to-the-minute with horror-porn. Its a given from the clever line ""James we need a gun"" that there will be no shortage of gore.

Kristen McKay (LIV TYLER) tries to escape her attackers in a terrifying suspense thriller about a couple whose remote getaway becomes a place of terror when masked strangers invade--The Strangers. Photo Glenn Watson/Rogue Movie review Killers drop by in Strangers 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Strangers Thriller. Starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. Directed by Bryan Bertino. (R. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Youve heard of the suspense genre. Old-fashioned. Heres something new for the new millennium The we-promise-theyre-dead genre. ""Funny Games"" earlier this year was just the floor model. Now we get the finished product ""The Strangers"" a movie that announces before the action even starts that the people in the movie end up dead. Obviously theyre still working out the bugs. For example if you announce before you start a movie that the protagonists are going to be brutally murdered then you should cast people the audience wants to see dead right? Then the audience can think ""Hey great Liv Tyler ends up dead. Lets not leave. We dont want to miss this."" The problem is theres nothing all that obnoxious about Tyler notwithstanding her performance in Bertoluccis ""Stealing Beauty."" Whod want to see something like this? ""The Strangers"" isnt even like a slasher movie in which there are usually eight reasonably insufferable or at least dispensable people who are all bumped off but one or two protagonists who survive. This movie focuses on just two characters who dont survive and the whole action involves showing them being really really scared. They dont know its hopeless. To fully appreciate what were dealing with here step back for a minute. Imagine you fly in from outer space wanting to see some earthling entertainment on a Friday night. You hide your antennae under a hat and sit down to watch ""The Strangers"" at a convenient cineplex. What would you conclude about the culture that would produce such an artifact for mass entertainment? You might think one of two things You might say this is a culture that intuits itself as teetering on the edge of an abyss which feels itself threatened by unreasoning external forces and considers itself utterly helpless to defend itself. Therefore it needs to replay this vision of its own destruction as a way of releasing and ameliorating its fear. Or you might say that this is a culture with people so decadent that they identify with murderers and enjoy the spectacle of their crimes. Or you might say both. I might say both. But heres the tricky thing about ""The Strangers."" Sure it uses cinema to ends that are objectionable and vile ... but it does it well with more than usual skill. So is that really a bad movie? Oscar Wilde said that art is neither good nor evil just well or badly made. But what would he say if he got a load of a young couple in a house getting menaced by three masked morons with knives and axes for 85 minutes? Would he sniff a flower and talk about the pacing and the arresting compositions? Or would he do what any reasonable Victorian would do and say ""Thank God Ive been dead for 100 years""? Of course lets give writer-director Bryan Bertino credit. He knows how to frame a shot to make characters seem vulnerable. He knows how to use sound particularly repeated sounds (ominous knocking a skipped record etc.) to get under the viewers skin. Now for his next trick he just needs to turn his talents toward something that isnt repulsive. By the way I have a message for anyone who might be reading this in 2108 thinking ""Can you believe the bad review this idiot gave one of the seminal masterpieces of the 21st century?""

"Strangers The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; strangers-the ) Strangers The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli We tend to think of our homes as places of safety and refuge. The illusory nature of such a belief is quickly dispelled in Bryan Bertinos debut feature The Strangers. A chilling horror film about a home invasion this movie doesnt break any new ground on a plot level but its interesting cinematography suffuses the production with an overpowering combination of paranoia and claustrophobia. This is one of those rare horror movies that concentrates on suspense and terror rather than on gore and a high body count. By keeping the premise simple and making the small group of characters seem like genuine human beings Bertino sets the audience up for a tense and uneasy 85 minutes. Its 400 am when Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman) arrive at his cabin in the woods. It has not been a good night for them - Kristen turned down his wedding proposal - but its about to get much worse. As theyre preparing for bed and trying to figure out how to bridge the gulf that has suddenly opened between them theres a knock at the door. This is the first of many such interruptions of the still night and it isnt long before harassment develops into something darker and more dangerous. The woods normally empty and serene now hold the promise of terror and death. Bertino has a lot of tricks up his sleeve to make this more than just another ""danger at home"" movie. He employs a hand-held camera and often shoots in close-up or from a characters point-of-view. He also allows us to see things the characters dont. We know long before they do that theres someone else in the house - we see a figure lurking in the background of a particularly chilling scene. (Cue audience screams.) The director also uses sound to good effect whether its an unnaturally loud pounding on the wooden front door or the jarring repetition of a record skipping in the middle of a country/western song. Every shot in the movie has a purpose - not merely to advance the plot but to do so in a manner that will disconcert even the most jaded viewer. The Strangers (there are three of them) wear masks. They are simple masks but as we know from the lesson taught by Michael Myers even a blank white covering of the face can be terrifying in certain circumstances. Bertino gets a lot of mileage out of these masks. The first few times we see them they generate far more shock than a human face no matter how disfigured could. After a while however the effect wears off. Maybe thats why before the movie comes to its conclusion the masks have been removed. Their capacity to instill terror diminishes with increased familiarity. The Strangers is not a perfect motion picture but its one of the horror genres rare recent standouts. The melodrama at the beginning is weak failing to connect us to the characters to the degree Bertino intends and the final shot is a bit of a cheat. The Strangers shares a premise and some plot points with Funny Games although with effective ""boo"" moments replacing social commentary. It also bears a strong resemblance to David Moreau amp; Xavier Paluds 2006 French movie Ils. (Whether The Strangers is a remake of Ils has been a topic of much debate.) There is a claim that this story has been ""inspired by"" true events - perhaps the Tate-LaBianca murders at the hands of the Manson Family or the Keddie Resort Cabin 28 kidnapping and killings. Actors Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman accomplish whats needed for the roles - which is mostly to act terrified do a lot of running and hiding and express disbelief. This is not an actors movie but the leads do nothing to discredit the film by being campy or overacting. They take the material seriously and thats enough. Tyler also proves she can scream with the best of the modern scream queens. The Strangers are played by actors (Gemma Ward Laura Margolis and Kip Weeks) but hidden behind their masks and with minimal dialogue theres not much for them to do. The Strangers is so effectively produced that if you arrive home after a night showing to find the electricity off you will have misgivings about going inside. Horror movies come in two categories those that deal in supernatural creatures and those that have their roots in very real dangers. The escapism that often categorizes and distances viewers in the former is absent in productions like this. Theres pain and blood in The Strangers but the movie is more about psychological torture than the physical variety. Its intense but not necessarily fun and may disappoint less sophisticated horror fans. However for die-hard supporters of unsettling peeks into the dark side of human nature this is a welcome excursion.

The Strangers (R) Rogue (84 min.) Directed by Bryan Bertino. With Liv Tyler Scott Speedman. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS A huge remote house a skittish young woman -- and suddenly a psychopath at the door. For movies like ""Scream"" that setup was an invitation for knowing tongue-in-cheek shocks. For the recently remade ""Funny Games"" it was a challenge to subvert every comforting cliche and then mock the audience for wanting them. For ""The Strangers"" though its a simple unironic blueprint. Unfolding with an almost startling lack of self-awareness young filmmaker Bryan Bertinos debut is such a careful straight-faced knockoff of 70s exploitation films it plays like a parody. The initial based-on-a-true-story titles (yeah right) even come with such stentorian voice-of-doom narration I laughed out loud. But if this is a spoof Bertino forgot the jokes. Forgot much of everything in fact except the crude setup. A squabbling young couple is spending a not-very-romantic night in the mans old childhood home. Then theres a knock at the door. ""Is Tamara here?"" Nope wrong house. Except soon the visitor returns with two friends -- all wearing masks and intent on killing the homeowners. No rhyme no reason no mercy. Thats as much as we get in terms of plot or character development. All thats left now is an hour or so of shocks -- as people get dragged down halls tied to chairs chased through woods stabbed in the gut and shotgunned in the face. Theres an ax through the door as in ""The Shining"" and a hideaway in a louvered closet as per ""Halloween."" All thats missing is a chainsaw. Well relevance too. Because what movies like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Last House on the Left"" connected with was a paranoia fed in part by the creepy-crawly invasions of the Manson family. Was that hippie chick knocking at your door a harmless flower child or one of Charlies girls? Better keep the chain on just in case. The best horror movies connect with our subconscious fears -- both drawing their power from them and ultimately exorcising them -- and thats what the great grindhouse flicks of the 70s did. Its what clumsily a whole wave of war-on-terror era horrors did too as they focused on vacations from hell. Its a scary world out there; better stay home. But theres no modern subtext for home-invasion thrillers; if theres a lurking fear in our houses now its that our ARM is about to readjust. And without subtext all thats left is misogynist sadism. Watch the pretty lady scream scream scream all alone. Bet shes sorry she fought with her boyfriend now The director isnt untalented. He has only one trick (have a menace pop up in the background unknown to the hero) but he uses it well and the film delivers some shocks. Audiences who want nothing more than the artistic equivalent of someone jumping out and shouting ""Boo"" every five minutes or so will consider ""The Strangers"" solid entertainment. Those looking for pathos or performance though will be disappointed. Asked to do little but run and survive (or alternately sit and sob) both lead actors labor to meet even those lowered expectations. Liv Tyler -- a passive big-boned beauty who always seems in danger of curling up for a nap -- cries prettily. Scott Speedman bustles about and tries to look heroic. The three villains wear masks. Their agents idea Id bet. Ratings note The film contains gory violence sexual situations and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 29 2008 715 PM The Strangers Thriller about a couple terrorized by serial killers. With Liv Tyler Scott Speedman. Director Bryan Bertino (130). R Graphic violence language. At area theaters.If the movies are any indication backwoods lunatics sure are fond of country music. And who could blame them? A scratchy recording of Merle Haggards ""Mama Tried"" provides the perfect creepy atmosphere in Bryan Bertinos old-fashioned fright fest ""The Strangers.""Bertino knows that its the little touches that count. For James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) who proposes to his girlfriend Kristen (Liv Tyler) during a romantic weekend that means rose petals in the bathtub. For the nut jobs who follow them to their isolated retreat in the woods it means silently and patiently standing behind your unsuspecting victim waiting for the perfect moment to say hello. As it happens James and Kristens evening went south long before they started running for their lives. In flashbacks we learn that Kristen rejected the proposal and theyve arrived at the house in a state of sadness and confusion. Bertino lets us know the ending right up-front so the movies kick comes in getting there. Once the first masked stranger knocks on the door its only a matter of minutes before James and Kristen are running through the house the woods and a nearby barn in a desperate search for places to hide. Masks are back in fashion in director Bryan Bertinos creepy The Strangers. You may have noticed that the plot sounds strikingly familiar and not just because the movie resembles all those 1970s B-movies youve watched at 3 a.m. Its also a near-duplicate of last years ""Vacancy"" - and the inevitable comparison does ""Strangers"" no favors. ""Vacancy"" director Nimrod Antal gave us a pair of heroes who fought like hell to survive becoming closer and stronger in the effort. Bertinos undeveloped protagonists are colossally stupid (him) and frustratingly passive (her). Still Bertino does an excellent job building dread especially during the first half of the movie. Every silence pause and sudden noise startles - and the results frankly are more frightening than the graphic torture scenes in movies like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw.""

It sounds stupid enough and ultimately is but the director Bryan Bertino stages The Strangers early scenes with spooky panache. The first killer in his burlap disguise creeps into the painterly low-lit frame with ghostly quiet; for a while the fear is vivid in a J-horror knockoff way. But then comes the blood the shrieking midnight chase scenes the anything-goes over-the-top-ness. In other words everything that we liked the movie for not being.

By Peter Rainer May 31 2008 Save for later Saved ""The Strangers"" is about a couple played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler whose potentially amorous overnight in a remote family home in the woods is interrupted by a trio of masked crazies who proceed to draw big-time blood.The fledgling writer-director Bryan Bertino - not to be confused with champion figure skater Brian Boitano - has said of his maiden effort ""Early on when I started writing I figured out that a way to connect with people was to scare them. Through doing that you can talk about other emotions other feelings and connect with them more easily.""Just once when some schlockmeister makes a scream-and-torture movie Id like to hear him (and its always a him) say he did it for the money. These movies - other recent specimens include ""Vacancy"" and ""Funny Games"" - represent a great way for filmmakers to connect with peoples wallets. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Which is not to say that ""The Strangers"" is unskillful. But to what end? Unlike others of his ilk Bertino doesnt immediately dive into the mayhem. The couple James and Kristen are on the outs after his marriage proposal has been rebuffed. Their prenuptial tryst turns chilly; the rose petals James has strewn throughout the cabin serve as reminders of what might have been. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Strangers But just because Bertino attempts to paint these two as real people as opposed to human targets is no reason to stand up and cheer. Hes still playing the same slasher-pic game only in a slightly different key. The ""humanizing"" of this couple is essentially a tease - a setup for the mayhem to come.And when it does its so gruesomely relentless that the effect is like watching a slo-mo snuff film. The actors playing the masked creepies never reveal their faces. (Good career move.) One wears a scarecrow hood the other two both women have doll-face and pinup mugs. When Kristen cries out to them ""Why are you doing this to us?"" one of the women answers ""Because you were home.""But sometimes dear reader theres no place like home and thats just where you should be when this gorefest opens at a theater near you.

Comments The Strangers Young lovers Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman arriving at his parents remote summer home after a wedding are terrorized in the wee hours by three masked assailants whose motives are never explained. Making his debut as writer-director Bryan Bertino exploits all the old horror standbys--the phony based-on-a-true-story preface the knock on the door in the dead of night the eerily skipping record on the turntable the malevolent figure glimpsed in soft focus over the heroines shoulder. Theres nothing remotely new here but the movie has the taut queasy feel of an early 70s drive-in shocker old-fashioned suspense without any guarantee of old-fashioned mercy. R 90 min. By J.R.

"Scary Strangers frightfully lacking - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Scary Strangers frightfully lacking Liv Tyler trapped in a house in the middle of nowhere tries to escape a trio of killers in ""The Strangers."" (GLENN WATSON) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / May 30 2008 ""The Strangers"" is a horror film with a moral. No matter how nasty a gang of murderers is the moviemaker calling the shots is ultimately worse. Bryan Bertino in his directing debut set out to make one of those home-invasion chillers whose terrors never let up. But he just seems interested in outdoing the grisliness of his peers. ""The Strangers"" is not more violent than the average horror movie. But it has a realist style meant to call attention to its maker. Bertino has the pretensions of an artist and the indelicacy of a hack. He tries to get under our skin with a pile driver.Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman play James and Kristen a couple tormented by three masked killers - a young man and two young women - in the dead of night in the middle of nowhere. Before introducing the tormentors the movie tries to make us care about the couple. Bertino demonstrates that he knows how to use flashbacks James asked Kristen to marry him. She said no. The mood for love obliterated they arrive at the house he borrowed and decorated with rose petals in celebration of their engagement. Oops. Now were trapped in an extra-mopey episode of ""Greys Anatomy."" Neither Tyler nor Speedman seems to mind being turned into a gorgeous knife block.The house looks like a set from 1972. It even has a childs record player that magically includes an LP by the woodland fairy Joanna Newsom. Eventually theres a knock at the big wood door. The voice on the other side asks ""Is Tamra home?"" And the fun is supposed to begin. The killers do things like fire shotguns heave axes write on windows and destroy cellphone chargers. But the frights in the movie are more for us than the characters. Our assailants loom blurry in the background and do such things as watch Kristen make her way from one shot to another. Then they disappear without a sound or a trace. Theyre bogeymen whose faces Bertino never shows us. Its ""In Cold Blood"" for dummies.Earlier this year the Austrian director Michael Haneke released a remake of his own home-invasion nightmare ""Funny Games."" The movie was charged with intellectual fraudulence It rubbed our noses in the very violence it purported to critique. But Haneke meant to distance us from the horrors so that we could see them clearly. The movie respected its (puny) audience.""The Strangers"" is too pornographically self-impressed to care what you think. And its too ignorant of the mechanics of suspense to really freak you out. The histrionic sound design with its bangs and crackles and slams works harder than everybody else. The scariest thing in the movie itself aside from how contemptuously made it happens to be is the narration. It comes on in the opening minutes and alleges that what were about to see is based on a true story. But what actually happened - whatever it was - couldnt have been this banal.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movienation.

But the only reason to go to The Strangers - a contemptible home-invasion creepfest - is for the voyeuristic kick of watching hapless victims stalked and tormented. And even the weirdos who plunk money down for that will come away disappointed. A meaningless waste of time (and money) with Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman as a moody twosome whose weekend getaway turns into a run-for-your-life freakout The Strangers claims to be ""inspired by true events."" Meaning that at some point in time some place in America some people came into a house and did incomprehensibly awful things to its occupants. Kristen McKay (Tyler) and James Hoyt (Speedman) are driving to his familys vacation place after attending a friends wedding. What was supposed to be a romantic weekend - James had run ahead to furnish the cabin with rose petals candles and champagne - has soured even before they get there He had proposed to her at the wedding reception and she declined. Tears streak their faces as the Volvo wagon rolls into the dark countryside. Hes brimming with confusion and rejection; shes fraught with doubt and worry. They eat sullenly. They talk a little. He puts music on. She takes a bath. And then at 4 a.m. theres a knock on the door. Some strange girl asking for Tamara. Kind of creepy but they let it go send her on her way. And then James goes to buy cigarettes. And then someones thumping on the doors scratching at the windows. . . . The rest of what ensues in The Strangers written and directed by first-timer Bryan Bertino with a passing nod to David Lynch (check out the Twin Peaks-y art direction in the poster) is your basic grisly cat- and-mouse stuff. The intruders are unidentifiable The guy in jacket and tie has a sack over his head and the two women wear arty doll masks. Cell phones dont work kitchen utensils get used for ill and Tyler and Speedman go through the various stages required of the actors fear quaking fear angry fear confrontational fear sobbing fear. At least with Michael Hanekes Funny Games - the German-language original and the directors own recent English remake - there was irony and commentary. However unpleasant the experience of watching a family get toyed with and tortured Haneke was undeniably getting at something the audiences role in watching these kinds of movies its complicity even. No one is getting at anything in The Strangers except the cheapest ugliest kind of sadistic titillation. The Strangers  (out of four stars) Directed by Bryan Bertino. With Liv Tyler Scott Speedman and actors in masks. Distributed by Rogue Pictures. Running time 1 hour 30 mins. Parents guide R (violence profanity adult themes).

A young couple at a remote house get some very-latenight highly unwelcome visitors in debuting writer-director Bryan Bertinos effectively stripped-down thriller ""The Strangers."" Offering home invasion horror on a less intellectualized plane than the recent ""Funny Games U.S."" ""Strangers"" should court correspondingly more robust patronage from mainstream fright fans -- even if this exercise too might leave some viewers wondering what the point is at the punishing journeys end. In an opening that appears to reprise with seriousness 70s genre cliches parodied in ""Grindhouses"" mock horror trailers a male voice grimly reads onscreen titles informing us that the events were about to see actually took place at 1801 Clark Road on Feb. 11 2005. (This is a ruse as Bertino has said the story isnt based on any particular case.) We then see two boys on bicycles bearing Christian literature cautiously step into a home whose destroyed front door is just the first sign of violence. On the soundtrack a womans hysterical call to 911 is heard. Rewind to the night before as Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman) silently drive back from a wedding reception she in tears. Reaching his familys old vacation home -- strewn with candles and rose petals in anticipation of a now-unlikely romantic finale to the evening -- it gradually becomes clear he proposed and her answer was not the one expected. Nonetheless theyre about to embark on some make-up sex when theres a knock at the door which is odd since its 4 a.m. Porch light out they dimly spy a blond girl outside asking ""Is Tamara here?"" Shes assured she has the wrong house. Later needing a drive to settle his nerves James goes to get Kristen some cigarettes leaving her alone in the isolated house surrounded by woods. She isnt alone for long though. Separation of leads personal injuries a friends untimely arrival and other invariably dire turns of fate keep the action which more or less plays out in real time taut. Bertino lenser Peter Sova and editor Kevin Greutert make things queasily simple Theres a distinct absence of the usual shock cuts false scares or even gore f/x though things get bloody enough. The disturbingly unemotional antagonists played by Gemma Ward Kip Weeks and Laura Margolis are just fleetingly glimpsed until quite late. Quiet is used to unsettling effect with tomandandys near-musique concrete score as well as whats supposed to be old vinyl folk/country records (but are in fact mostly new alt-country tracks by the likes of Gillian Welch and Wilco) sparsely deployed. Its all efficiently nerve-jangling with Tyler and Speedman credibly registering every hue of panic. Still after such a long creepy cannily restrained buildup (in order to look more action-packed the pics promos cannibalize bits from right up toward the end) it must be said the resolution is rather flat a full-circle postscript rote. Instead of the chill atmosphere following one out of the theater these last moments instill a more ""Yeah whatever"" aftertaste. Shot in South Carolina the productions tech and design elements are all on the money.

In both films intruders invade isolated vacation retreats and proceed to taunt and terrorize the unfortunate souls inside. But while Funny Games plays like a hypocritical morality tale The Strangers is a straightforward white-knuckled shocker. The movie almost feels like it was written in shorthand. We quickly meet James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) young gorgeous and returning from a wedding reception. She has turned down his marriage proposal - were not sure why - and they are glumly spending the night at his familys vacation home. Emotionally things are pretty bleak. Then a befuddled young woman knocks on the couples door at 4 a.m. asking ""Is Tamara home?"" From there the movie hurtles into nightmare territory and the pace never lets up. Turns out the waif has two people with her. They all wear masks or a hood and their sole purpose seems to be the elimination of the toothsome twosome. First-time writer and director Bryan Bertino makes a splashy debut here. He swiftly creates a dark unsettling mood that never lightens. This isnt a sly wink-at-the-audience horror flick; instead it plays out with a gruesome frankness that recalls such great drive-in fare as The Last House on the Left. Bertinos fondness for old horror movies is evident throughout. The plot is tight and compact and avoids any deep philosophizing or pat psychology. When Kristen asks why the couple are being targeted the reply is simply ""Because you were home."" The sheer randomness of the statement makes the whole setup that much creepier. Of course the flip side of the movie being so lean and mean is that you may feel like asking ""Is that all there is?"" once the credits roll. But if youre a fan of the genre The Strangers provides all the shocks and scares you could possibly want. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.
