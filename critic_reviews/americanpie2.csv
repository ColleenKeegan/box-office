Less a movie than another efficient moneymaking machine for Universal Pictures pic takes up the comedy saga of five hormonally obsessed buddies ongoing sexual education as they finish their freshman year in college. Theres no pastry in sight in ""American Pie 2"" but otherwise the second serving is -- not surprisingly -- identical to the first. Less a movie than another efficient moneymaking machine for Universal Pictures pic takes up the comedy saga of five hormonally obsessed buddies ongoing sexual education as they finish their freshman year in college. Repetition is what ""Pie"" fans want and what they get but a shrewd commercial strategy begets -- unlike for example ""Rush Hour 2"" -- a remarkably boring comedy. Nonetheless the just-established August B.O. record by the Jackie Chan/Chris Tucker hit could immediately fall as this franchise with an R rating or not continues to roll on and on and on until these kids finally grow up. Adam Herzs new script is like a schematic drawing in which you can trace the direct links between the so to speak highlights of the first movie and the second. Instead of a pie Jason Biggs nervous-in-the-sack Jim now gets super adhesive glue. Instead of sex play broadcast over the Internet its now broadcast over walkie-talkie radios. And instead of Eugene Levy as Jims well-meaning but hopelessly square dad walking in on Jim pleasuring himself he now walks in on Jim doing it with a gal in his dorm room. This opening scene has already been made so familiar by the mass-saturated theatrical and TV trailers that its effect is worn down to the nub. Director J.B. Rogers seems to have studied the first film for which he did the a.d. chores with religious devotion His camera moves and placements are as obediently plain-wrap in style as the previous pic and it seems that much of the early party scene hosted by wild man Stifler (Seann William Scott) is shot-for-shot identical to the Stifler party scene in the original ""Pie."" Jim and the guys -- Stifler Oz (Chris Klein) Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) -- may say that they feel a year older but they dont look like it. After Stifler gets a dose of urine rather than the champagne spritzes he was expecting his noisy shindig is shut down by cops. These party animals have to look elsewhere for a pad and Kevins older brother (Casey Affleck) has just the place A lovely gabled Michigan lakeside home. Ensconced in the great digs for the summer the guys take on house-painting to pay the rent. Jim has received a call from Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) saying that shell be visiting him later in the summer and already hes worked up about it. Oz has had to say goodbye to Heather (Mena Suvari) whos off to a travel study project in Barcelona. Finchs recent adventures with Asian women have gotten him deeply into Eastern meditation and sexual practice a rich font of possible comedy that the movie oddly never knows quite what to do with. Kevins encounter with ex-g.f. Vicky (Tara Reid) is notes always-removed observer Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) ""as comfortable as a high colonic in Tijuana."" Jim as before gets most of the long comedy scenes. To restore his nerve for seeing Nadia and get love advice he hunts down his high school prom date and chirpy flautist Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) whos studying at the Tall Oaks band camp. He ends up in as hamfisted a comic bit as anything this summer performing on trumpet to an outdoor amphitheater audience. Later in a pallid knockoff of Ben Stillers spectacularly painful bathroom scene in ""Theres Something About Mary"" Jim grabs the glue rather than the lube for some solo bedtime action. In a scene so infinitely long that Jim must actually share screen time with others Stifler is sure that the occupants of the house theyre painting are lesbians. Always led by whats below the belt he busts into their place to check out the love den with Jim and Finch joining him. Theyre caught though when the women (Denise Faye Lisa Arturo) return. For all of ""Pies"" reputed raunch its amazing to notice what business it shies away from this time as if it were as ratings-phobic as its PG-13 competition. The setup for some hairy stuff is all there when Jim whose privates are swollen from his one-night-stand with the glue discovers that Nadia has arrived early. Nothing really happens His package is healed and his heart isnt really with Nadia anymore but with Michelle whom he recognizes as a fellow nerd. Not even a last-minute arrival by Stiflers mom (Jennifer Coolidge in an uncredited cameo) can heat up the pic though it does wonders for the grateful Finch. Part of the softness comes from a lack of genuine testosterone-driven energy by the central male ensemble led by Biggs who is not getting any funnier with each lead role. Though he may provide a sort of likable innocent rooting interest in contrast to the subhuman Stifler Biggs tends to confuse being charming with being pathetic. Hes the face of todays young American male insecurity and its not pretty. Thomas emerges out of the crowd with the same droll style he showed before with more screen time for the sequel. Thats also true for Haningan who has one of the goofiest faces in movies since Louise Lasser and certainly has no match in this ensemble for original comic chops. Circulating as usual in his own parental universe Levy briefly reprises his shtick. The rest of the cast fades into the wallpaper of the summer house nicely designed by Richard Toyon. Pic is technically a clone of the first lensed as bright and as flat as possible. Once again too the soundtrack is generally a train of the bland pop-punk song leading the bland.

Starring Jason Biggs Shannon Elizabeth Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein. Directed by J.B. Rogers. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It might have gone on forever. The adventures of the four buddies introduced in ""American Pie"" might have become a male movie version of TVs ""Sex amp; the City"" -- funny adaptable to change and always shockingly honest. But with the release of ""American Pie 2"" this would-be series hits the wall. No longer fresh -- though thats to be expected in a sequel -- it contains none of the virtues that made the first one anarchic and original. The lack of honesty is the fatal flaw. With its mix of lewd jokes sentimentalized characters and fake emotion ""American Pie 2"" has less in common with its predecessor and everything in common with every other bad comedy ever made about randy young men. Its as if screenwriter Adam Herz read the reviews and tailored the script accordingly. Jason Biggs who had sex with a pie in the last installment becomes the focus as Jim who is still pining for Nadia the Czech exchange student played by Shannon Elizabeth. Eugene Levy who was delightful in small doses as Jims dad gets to run his one-joke character into the ground this time out. In scene after scene Dad attempts to show his understanding for Jims sexual predicaments by bringing up unwelcome details from his relationship with Jims mother. Alyson Hannigan who as the flute-playing nerd had the funniest moment in the last movie is back. But in an attempt to turn an absurd type into a rounded character the script tosses out everything that made her funny. Were left with a gentle portrait of a quirky girl -- nice but for another movie. Meanwhile Jims buddies though ever-present spend the sequel treading water. Chris Klein as the gentle jock Oz is in love with Heather (Mena Suvari) but shes in France for the summer. So much for that story line. As Kevin Thomas Ian Nicholas goes through the entire movie moping about the fact that his former girlfriend (Tara Reid) wants nothing to do with him except to hug and be friends. No punch line here. She really wants nothing to do with him. Nicholas goes through the movie with nothing to do. The same goes for the last member of the quartet Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas). In the last film he had sex with the mother of the class bully and in this one he misses her. Hed really like to see her again. Great. The only cast member to have his role improved since the first installment is Seann William Scott who plays Stifler an obnoxious rich-boy vulgarian. ""American Pie 2"" gives us Stifler unbound -- more raucous more rowdy more loud more crude than before. The four friends decide to get a summer house by the lake and invite Stifler to join them in order to make the rent. Since the guys despise Stifler its hardly a realistic turn but then its not just economic for the boys -- its economic for the filmmakers. With one device all the characters are under one roof. ""American Pie"" had a certain urgency with its story of four guys frantic to lose their virginity before high school graduation. In ""American Pie 2"" Herz and director J.B. Rogers attempt to replicate that urgency but they come up with something weak Nadia is going to visit the summer house by the end of the summer. Jim knows she is just crazy about him but he is worried that he might not be good in bed. So hes frantic to get good before she arrives. Obviously Jim has nothing remotely resembling a problem here. He thinks he does but thats a slender complication from which to build a movie. Seeking sexual advice Jim goes to the band geek with whom he lost his virginity the previous summer and gets instruction on how to make love. Meanwhile he lives in a house with four guys who are a lot more experienced than he is but he never asks them. In a more honest film he would have. Biggs is an amusing comic with a flair for physical shtick but hes not the most endearing performer nor is Jim a character with many sides to him. With Chris Klein and other equally talented fellows in the cast it seems disproportionate to place an entire picture on Biggs shoulders. It does Biggs no good -- especially near the finish when the Nadia story is resolved in a way so false and so disappointing as to make an audience hiss and boo. Gross sex jokes are about all this one has going for it and while they seem less organic this time out there are some laugh-out-loud moments involving Super Glue and a porn video. Ill say no more. Advisory This film contains strong language nudity and sexual situations.

""American Pie 2"" features the same actors as ""American Pie"" contains the same infantile sex jokes and operates on the same guiding principle namely to make as much money as possible without even approaching competence or originality. Obviously this thing is scientifically engineered to be a stupid movie. The catch is that its a cynical unbelievably lazy stupid movie and its pawned off as one of the major releases of the summer. Jason Biggs stars once again as Jim an earnest young guy who stumbles into all kinds of hee-larious situations when he tries to masturbate or have sex. Jim and his buddies from the last picture -- Oz (Chris Klein) Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and Stifler (Sean William Scott) -- now have a year of college under their belts. They still want nothing more than to do the nasty and they try everything in their power to make it happen. Eventually they run out of time and you get to go home.

"USATODAY.com - American Pie 2 not as tasty as the original recipe Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 08/13/2001 - Updated 0959 AM ET American Pie 2 not as tasty as the original recipe By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY American Pie 2 (out of four) Stars Jason Biggs Chris Klein Seann William Scott Director J.B. Rogers Distributor Universal Rating R for strong sexual content crude humor language and drinking Movie sequels are a lot like sex. You cant repeat the first time. You can try to re-create the experience. Invite the same people to perform. Revisit the settings. Crack the same jokes. Duplicate the special moments with only minor variations to break the boredom. But unlike Madonna most of us cant pretend to feel touched for the very first time. Not when whats served is recycled goods. Thats the facts of life American Pie 2-style. Krazy Glue no matter where it gets stuck cant beat violating a bakery product for shock or entertainment value. Read more Video American Pie 2 trailer Stories American Pie 2 out-grosses competition Get to know Stiflers mom Read the two-star review Talk Read the chat transcript with Shannon Elizabeth Box-office estimates This weeks top ten in theaters This second slice just isnt as deliciously naughty as the original piece. Pie 1 was a groundbreaker not only for its now-common gross-outs but also for the adolescent sweetness it squeezed from its young cast. But the core quartet of sex-obsessed guys (Jason Biggs as hapless Jim Chris Klein as faithful Oz Thomas Ian Nicholas as fretful Kevin and Eddie Kaye Thomas as token sophisticate Finch) lost their virginity by the end of the first Pie. What could possibly be a fitting encore? (It says a lot careerwise that all were unbooked enough to come back for the sequel.) The filmmakers all but acknowledge their handicap and give in to the inevitable temptation. They do everything the same only slightly different and anyone who hasnt sampled the first Pies bits will surely be left wondering whats so funny. Now its the summer after freshman year of college and the foursome may be experienced in the sack but not that much more. They share a beach house work as house painters and throw parties. That covers it. Save for the tasteless gags and romantic travails. Stifler (the incomparable Seann William Scott) has another yucky encounter with a bodily fluid. An intimate get-together is broadcast publicly. Jims Dad (Eugene Levy) delivers more of his squirm-inducing father-son lectures. Its hard to get too hot and bothered over whether Biggs will gather enough makeout tips from Alyson Hannigans flute-tooting Michelle to impress Shannon Elizabeths exotic hottie Nadia. Or if Nicholas can ""just be friends"" with his lone conquest Vicky (a tired-looking Tara Reid). Scott is a different story. His Stifler is the id unchained a totally uncensored crude dude whose patron saint is a cross between Bluto and Otter from Animal House. When his obnoxious pickup artist is onscreen the film leaps to attention. As for the rest of Pie 2 its a cheap and easy amusement one thats gone a little stale and never quite rises to the occasion.

B. Rogers; Author Adam Herz; Producer (person) Chris Moore; Producer (group) Universal; Release Date Wide 08/10/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Universal Posted August 17 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Superglue plays a significant comedic role in ""American Pie 2."" Thats all Ill say about the quick-drying mucilage except to add that scholars of the 1999 original film will deduce that building model airplanes is not the adhesives demonstrated use - and that theres a sexual joke involved. If the first slice of sweetly raunchy ""Pie"" was about high school seniors intent on losing their cherries this second serving is about how those same now experienced buddies advance their carnal studies in the summer between their freshman and sophomore years of college. Renting a beach house together bumbling Jim (Jason Biggs) angling Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) suave Oz (Chris Klein) pretentious Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) and uncouth Stifler (Seann William Scott his close-set eyes perpetually imitating a horndogs slavering glare) aim to Get Lucky with chicks. So the guys party like its...1965 the summer of ""Beach Blanket Bingo."" Thats the charm of the ""American Pie"" concept from Adam Herz and original ""Pie"" directors Paul and Chris Weitz and the deep-crust sexually conservative heart of the enterprise too. These amiable young gentlemen and their young female friends (flaunting flesh no saucier than whats glimpsed in a Maidenform ad) may live in a contemporary material world of cell phones and Tommy Hilfiger wear but their sexual interests adventures and insecurities are as soft-core and coyly out-of-date as any yellowed issue of Playboy magazine. Even though theyre now college dudes fulfillment for fellas is still predicated on copping a feel and downing a brewski. In fact so engrossed are they in the pleasures of teen bikini movies past and so businesslike is director J.B. Rogers (""Say It Isnt So"") in moving the comedy along at a summer-movie clip (juiced by a forgettable soundtrack of pop tracks) the young men dont realize that the familiar young women in front of them - including sexy Czech Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) wiseacre Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) independent Heather (Mena Suvari) no-nonsense Vicky (Tara Reid) and band-camp geek Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) - have indeed advanced a year. All the girls have changed (except maybe Stiflers mom personified once again by Jennifer Coolidge); all the boys lag behind (except maybe Jims dad hilariously played once again as a clueless boomer by Eugene Levy). All the punchlines are served on dessert plates. All the family values remain intact held fast with a substance even stronger than superglue Nostalgia for sexual innocence past.

"American Pie 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-pie-2 ) American Pie 2 (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the case of American Pie more is less. As in less funny less sexy and much much less enjoyable. This sequel like so many that have preceded it this year exists exclusively because its forerunner made a lot of money - and the lack of inspiration behind the movie shows in every frame. Desperation permeates the production - a desperation to match the outrageousness hilarity and vulgarity of the first American Pie. Only in the third category does it come close. Everything about this picture is flat - the performances the direction the screenplay the ""comic"" sequences and the energy level. Yet as big a dud as the movie is it will doubtlessly be a huge hit because the movie-going public no longer seems to care about film quality as long as they see a few familiar faces. Two years from now well probably be watching American Pie 3. The ""force"" behind American Pie brothers Paul and Chris Weitz have only Executive Producer credits indicating a low level of involvement. Its hard to say whether that has anything to do with how discouraging the sequel is. The screenwriter Adam Herz is the same for both installments although this latest script was written on auto-pilot. The director is J.B. Rogers who was the first assistant director for American Pie. This is his second feature; his debut was the hideously bad Say It Isnt So. Considering the quality of that outing even the disappointment that is American Pie 2 represents a step in the right direction. Virtually everyone from the first movie is back for the return engagement although some of the pretty faces such as those belonging to Tara Reids Vicky and Shannon Elizabeths Nadia arent around much (and have no real reason to be present at all). In fact of all the women from American Pie only one has significant screen time - Alyson Hannigan who plays band camp babe Michelle. Of course all the guys are on hand including lead dork Jim (Jason Biggs); his sensitive big-guy friend Oz (Chris Klein); his normal buddy Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas); and his obsessed-with-an-older-woman pal Paul (Eddie Kaye Thomas). Then theres Stifler (Seann William Scott) who has a larger role here because of the actors popularity spurt in the last two years. The events of American Pie 2 transpire a year after those related in its predecessor. Although the principals have all gone off to college not much has changed (although Kevin and Vicky are no longer together). Oz and Heather (Mena Suvari) are still an item. Jim remains a model of sexual insecurity and inexperience. And Stifler is just as rude crude and lewd as ever. Together Jim Kevin Oz Paul and Stifler rent a beach house for the summer and thats where the various misadventures of American Pie 2 take place including a romance between Jim and Michelle. Unlike American Pie which actually had a story this picture can boast little more than a skeletal plot that serves as the device by which a series of sketches can be presented. There is a lot of forced humor in American Pie 2 - scenes that have been included simply because theres that expectation of ""shocking"" raunchiness. So we are given the dubious honor of observing a golden shower a sequence in which a character mistakenly uses quick-drying glue as a masturbation aid and a segment with some same-sex activity. Admittedly the material generates as many laughs as it does groans but the breezy freshness that surrounded American Pie has been replaced by a sense of obligatory crudeness. We chortled our way through the first film because it pushed the envelope in a way that was often funny and occasionally hilarious; American Pie 2 calculatedly attempts to replicate the things that made the original successful and fails. Then theres the matter of character development. American Pie had some - we cared about Jim and his friends. This time theyre just pawns to a stale plot and punch lines to lame jokes. Although the movies are entirely different watching American Pie 2 offers a similar experience to that of sitting through Scary Movie 2. You can see all the seams in the movie and sense how frantic the filmmakers were to replicate their previous success. But when a motion picture is the result of a financial impulse not a creative one this is often the unfortunate result. American Pie 2 (United States 2001) Director J.B.
