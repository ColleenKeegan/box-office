"In Friday Night Lights the football film goes deep - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Friday Night Lights the football film goes deep By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 8 2004 ""Friday Night Lights"" has an arresting poster probably the best for any movie all year. Three high school football players stand side by side on the 50-yard line helmeted with their backs to the viewer. Theyre facing the far-off packed stands and two floodlight towers. The men clasp hands and they all have a leg thats bent at the knee and pulled slightly back.Whats striking about the picture is its symmetry and ambiguity. The men could be dancers bowing at a curtain call. When exactly in a game does a moment like this happen? Theres no football no cheerleaders no grunting no blood sweat or tears just that image which distills from a bruising sport this note of elegance.In the movie the scene from the poster lasts for two seconds and is a lot less ethereal but the film itself is often just as lyrical if more melancholy. It contains all the stuff so beautifully absent from the photo the essential things like testosterone referees and the game itself. But it also bears something you rarely experience in a football movie. ""Friday Night Lights"" has a soul.Set in the Odessa Texas of 1988 a place of ubiquitous oil drills and a seeming cultural barrenness the movie recounts the true tale of the Permian Panthers and the teams quest for another state title. It walks the standard path that most underdog sports stories take to reach a kind of ragged glory. Theres the cocky star running back (Derek Luke) the shy quarterback (Lucas Black grown up and quite good) with a sick mom (Connie Cooper) and the butterfingers receiver (Garrett Hedlund) with the abusive drunk dad (Tim McGraw the country star). Billy Bob Thornton compassionate in a cooperative hairpiece plays the coach and here and there we see Connie Britton as his supportive wife.There are recruiters unseen commentators running play by plays lots of time in the locker room and the nagging desperation of a town with a population thats counting on the Panthers to make it to the state championships. Theres not much in ""Friday Night Lights"" that you havent ever seen or couldnt have imagined. Relative to most Hollywood sports movies however it just feels new.The film is based on the moving book the landfaring journalist H.G. ""Buzz"" Bissinger wrote more than a decade ago. Director Peter Berg working with expensive-looking production draws out these lives so you can see how the sport as its typically said of Lone Star football is the regional religion. (In one of the opening scenes a mother runs plays with her son at breakfast.)You rarely sense the screenplay which Berg wrote with David Aaron Cohen pushing characters to act although Lukes performance might be too showy even for a gridiron diva. But after his character is injured in the seasons first game and he realizes his life in football might be over Luke has a weepy collapse that actually fills you with sadness for his busted dreams.The picture toys with time skipping from the present to a few seconds of something that happened an hour or a day before. This doesnt deepen the meaning but it does lend considerable atmosphere which is further enriched by the excellent drums-and-guitar score from the art band Explosions in the Sky. Its rumbling steroidal and wistful -- sometimes during the same game. Bergs impressionistic approach (a flurry of scenes in the service of a mood) finally answers what millions of men have probably been dying to know how a Terrence Malick football movie might go. ""Friday Night Lights"" is very much in the plaintive key of Malicks World War II ballad ""The Thin Red Line."" This movie is just shorter and less sensual.Berg once played the bad-boy doctor on ""Chicago Hope"" then he made 1998s morally disgusting ""Very Bad Things."" Surprisingly his second movie last years muscular playful ""The Rundown"" showed improvement It stuck Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in the jungle. ""Friday Night Lights"" is a logical next choice He seems to be making a name for himself as a director of commercial movies for extremely virile yet openly sensitive men. He doesnt have Malicks artistry in him (hes too transparent) but hes not nearly the bullying hack Tony Scott (""Man on Fire"") is either.In fact he seems on the verge of revitalizing the male weepie. When the star quarterback throws a spiral to a gang of eager football-whipped kids it feels like hes just tossed them a very hard very fast leather bouquet.

Consider it mission accomplished. The Panther football team quickly finds out that Lone Star football glory only lasts so long in the season premiere of the show NBC is hoping will find a broader and much larger audience on its new night. After critics raved but ratings fizzled nows not the time for ""Friday Night Lights"" to play prevent defense storywise and congratulate itself for surviving but rather the writers and cast must strive to make sure nobody gets complacent reading press clippings. Consider it mission accomplished. Season two begins in the oppressive Texas heat the players laying around poolside when theyre not practicing on the field gearing up to defend their state title. Much of the action thoughout the episode stays clear of the gridiron focusing on where the characters stand after last seasons triumph Julie Taylor (Aimee Teegarden) is making goo-goo eyes for a hunky older guy completing dissing her boyfriend QB1 Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford); Lyla (Minka Kelly) has found religion; Jason Street (Scott Porter) is concerned new coach Jack MacGregor (Chris Mulkey) is tinkering with a team that already knows how to win; and ex-coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) is having a difficult time splitting his time between Dillon where his wife (Connie Britton) has just had a baby and Austin. Longtime character actor Mulkey looks to be a great addition playing a hardass who only knows one way to win football games -- his way. In one scene Chandler listening to Porter explain his concerns for the way the team is being treated doesnt say a word but the actors eyes and jaw clearly express his disappointment for the direction these new Panthers are headed. Later on he has a touching heart-to-heart with his daughter on her disdain for him being away from home. His exclusion from the list of Emmy noms feels even more reprehensible now. One highly dramatic storyline that involves Tyra (Adrianne Palicki) and Landry (Jesse Plemons) might worry some hardcore fans that the show is heading in a direction that could feel more ""CSI Dillon"" than anything else. But faith should be shown in showrunner/writer Jason Katims in that hes setting a device to see how this budding couple react under trying circumstances. Handheld lensing remains one of the shows signature elements and might take new viewers an episode or two to become acquainted with the visual style. Friday Night LightsNBC Fri.

And the teenage boys who play for the Permian Panthers--Texass most successful high-school team--are treated in those all too brief years of glory like gods. That is when they play well. Journalist H. G. Bissinger followed the team through its 1988 season and his best-selling book ""Friday Night Lights"" has become a kind of classic. It chronicles a town whose identity is inextricably tied to the fate of its team an exhilarating and terrifying prospect.That ambivalent electricity courses through Peter Bergs bone-crunching heart-twisting movie. ""Friday Night Lights"" gets you cheering for the Panthers but its a far cry from the usual rah-rah sports-movie formula--closer in texture and ambition to the documentary ""Hoop Dreams"" than to the pious ""Remember the Titans."" While its concentration rarely strays from the gridiron it has lots to say about race class celebrity competition and the way dreams can inspire as well as devour the dreamer.The coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) has a bigger salary than the schools principal. Everything in the bleak wind-swept west Texas town looks puny next to the gleaming stadium. That 1988 season the teams hopes for a state championship ride on running back Boobi Miles (Derek Luke of ""Antwone Fisher"") a cocky hotshot prospect who has college recruiters drooling. The quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) is Boobies opposite an uncertain unsmiling kid taking care of a sick mother. Even worse off is fumble-prone tailback Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) living with his vicious alcoholic father (Tim McGraw) a former high-school football star whose life has dead-ended. Disaster strikes the Panthers when Boobi is hurt. For a guy whose locker is filled with Mercedes Benz catalogs whose only hope of a future lies in football the idea that his knee injury is serious is too cataclysmic to be believed. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Bergs film which he wrote with David Aaron Cohen explodes in a hyperventilating handheld fast-cutting style that threatens at first to become overbearing. But inside the flash is subtlety these brief glimpses are always telling. Nothing is superfluous. The surprise is how deeply engaged you become with the characters how shattering their victories and defeats become. The movie can only skim the sociological surface that Bissinger explored in depth. And Berg sometimes sacrifices football logic for drama with a minute left and half a field to cover to win you dont call running plays. That said few films have shown so powerfully the slashing double edge of sports fever.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Comments Friday Night Lights Recommended H.G. Bissingers best seller about the 1988 high school football championships in Texas gets a heart-pounding big-screen treatment that captures all the action of a tumultuous season while showing the emotional toll on the players. Billy Bob Thornton gives an understated performance as coach Gary Gaines whose small-town Permian Panthers are pursuing their fifth state title; his ability to withstand community pressure shores up a group of teens who face trouble at home and/or a future without many prospects. Derek Luke (Antwone Fisher) stands out as the star running back ably assisted by Jay Hernandez Lucas Black Garrett Hedlund and country musician Tim McGraw. Peter Berg (The Rundown) directed though the 100-odd football plays were choreographed by his second-unit director former USC offensive lineman Allan Graf. PG-13 117 min.

Based on HG Bissingers best-selling account of the Permian Panthers 1988 state championship season - a study beloved of sports fans and sociologists alike - Peter Bergs potent drama depicts a post-industrial town whose entire emotional even spiritual life is vicariously invested in a bunch of teenage athletes. Not just local celebrities fawned over or reviled as results dictate the Panthers are latter-day warriors filing out for training to a military score the squad have the bearing of a platoon on exercises or gladiators primed for sacrifice. We are in the business of protecting this town intones Billy Bob Thorntons otherwise sensitively subdued coach - not from attack but despair.Sharing its subjects sports-centric tunnel vision (theres no hint of academic activity for these schoolkids) Friday Night Lights achieves considerable emotional impact by dissecting the various ways such intense pressure bears on these kids who pass most of the movie with gritted teeth and furrowed brows. Taciturn painfully conscientious quarterback Mike (Lucas Black) struggles to balance obligations to family town and himself while tearaway tailback Don (Garrett Hedlund) is loaded with the bullying expectation of his deadbeat dad himself a washed-up former champ; only cocky star player Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) actually relishes the experience preening strutting and crowing until injury strikes him with the force of bereavement. Working with a subdued palette Berg maintains a strong momentum regularly ratcheted up for games (and the occasional social encounter) in episodes of rhythmic almost musical montage and sound design. The affecting gruelling result is less a document of recreational sport than one of obligation and ordeal.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Lone Star Staters seek salvation in their pro and college teams but they unleash their almightiest zealotry for the high school game where teenagers often play out of fear rather than for fun and coaches are rudely welcomed with ""For Sale"" signs in their yards after each loss. ""Friday Night Lights"" faithfully based on H.G. Bissingers 1990 nonfiction bestseller is both a poignant celebration and a chilly condemnation of the high school gridiron as Gods country. A true story it marvels at the pure beauty of a tightly spiraled Hail Mary pass and the intricate camaraderie of young men but it also takes its gritty time blanching at a beastly community -- dunderheaded teachers and parents of players included -- that cheers for uniforms rather than for the kids quaking inside them. Only in the flicks final act does a rah-rah Tinseltown touch intrude on the verite feel but by that point even the most cynical of filmgoers will be calling out for a Kleenex. From left Derek Luke Billy Bob Thornton Lee Thompson Young and Lucas Black in Peter Bergs captivating football film ""Friday Night Lights.""

As a searing summer gives way to a balmy fall the only talk in town -- on radios in barbershops in police stations -- is about whether the Permian High School football crew which plays in a colossal 6 million stadium has the guts to win the state championship. The Permian Panthers certainly have the talent. This seasons stud running back is Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) an exquisitely ripped defiantly cocky kid whose locker overflows with desperate pleas from big-name colleges -- not to mention slick brochures for the luxury cars that hell surely be steering once he jukes his way to the pros. The quarterback is sullen cutie Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) whose only job is to hand the ball to Boobie and watch the points pile up. Wanton women throw themselves at the pigskin slinger -- and redneck neighbors thrust their infant children at him seeking both blessing and photo op -- but Mike is miserable He knows hell never get out of dreary Odessa unless he shows off his arm for college scouts but hes afraid to leave out of concern for his mentally unhinged mother who ruins her sons breakfast by sternly quizzing him about the teams playbook. The teams question mark just may be its head coach Gary Gaines (an understated Billy Bob Thornton) who has failed to win the state championship in his first two seasons at the school. The opposite of the stereotypical go-get-em play caller Gaines is a pensive Xs-and-Os man and his solemn nature and genuine affection for his players make him suspect in the eyes of select boosters before the season even begins. His mantra is ""Be perfect"" but that rallying cry starts to sound wrongheaded to Gaines when townsfolk barge into his office to suggest new defensive schemes and all but threaten him and his family if the Panthers dont bring the trophy home. Actor-turned-director Peter Berg whose previous helming gigs were the mean-spirited ""Very Bad Things"" and the dum-dum actioner ""The Rundown"" smoothly unveils the Panthers season like a fever dream bleaching the color from the scenes off the field and telling those between-game stories with stomach-knotting pockets of silence and doom. Although Berg only hints at the racial undercurrents the book illuminated a dinner party where Gaines is confronted by bigoted fans is excruciating. And the movies bittersweet heart is the relationship between a fumble-prone tailback (Garrett Hedlund) and an abusive alcoholic father who wields his Permian championship ring from way-back-when as a veritable weapon. (Country singer Tim McGraw bravely taking off his Stetson and revealing the bald spot we all knew was there plays the bad dad with a convincing mix of rage and reluctance.) When it comes to the action on the field however the movie explodes like a Technicolor nightmare. Berg smartly blends MTV-style cuts with the slo-mo glory of those vintage NFL Films His camera ducks and weaves herks and jerks and the quick-cut edits are smoothly synchronized with each bone-breaking tackle -- hits that are amped up with a tinnitus-inducing pow. The game footage is breathtaking but exhausting. In fact forget the large popcorn and just order an oxygen tank. Bissingers book succeeded partly because the Panthers do in fact have an unforgettable season but for reasons both jubilant and cruel. It would be unfair to give away too many of the very real twists that befell the Panthers but lets just say that Luke is a marvel as Boobie and when the star is forced to contemplate a life without football his breakdown in the arms of a loving uncle is a heart-wrencher. And sad sack Thornton plays Gaines almost as a victim letting his woe-is-me eyes do the acting as the Panthers get closer and closer to glory and his head gets increasingly cluttered with the madness surrounding him. (Thorntons scenes with Black with whom he worked in ""Sling Blade"" are especially moving.) The music might swell a little too loud during the big finish and a cheeseball coda might threaten the balanced storytelling the movie worked so hard to achieve. But give credit to Berg for keeping Bissingers all-too-true ending intact. Its a doozy. And if its not exactly what the Panthers wanted its definitely what the obsessed football fans of Odessa deserved. Friday Night Lights (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for obscenity sexual content and underage drinking.

Friday Night Lights explores something deeper a towns obsession. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Friday Night Lights Drama. Starring Billy Bob Thornton Lucas Black and Derek Luke. Directed by Peter Berg. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). ""Friday Night Lights"" tells the story of a real-life high school football team in Odessa Texas battling to make it into the state finals in 1988. But its about more than that. Its an examination of the phenomenon of high school sports the heartbreaks the life lessons and the neurotic investment a town can have in a teams success. Other sports movies do little but try to make the audience root for the team. ""Friday Night Lights"" accomplishes that almost in passing. Its real triumph is in the way it allows us to watch the action from a discerning and more rewarding distance. What we see is something sad and human bestial and ridiculous pathetic and grand. People who like sports movies will love ""Friday Night Lights"" but so will people who dont like sports movies and would never think of seeing a high school football game. Its more about sociology than championships. Director Peter Berg who as an actor was best known for starring opposite Linda Fiorentino in ""The Last Seduction"" does everything he can to keep the audience at an alert and watchful remove. Though set in the 80s ""Friday Night Lights"" could not be confused for an 80s film -- the technique is too obviously modern. Berg goes in for quick cuts hand-held shots and fast smeary pans. Its a risky approach but it succeeds here because its guided by a point of view. Berg is presenting a world he wants us to see as something apart from our own and fixed in an earlier time. The intention is not to give us the actual event but snippets of the event as they might exist in memory. In keeping with that intention ""Friday Night Lights"" is shot on a film stock that exaggerates contrasts while washing out colors. It really does look like a memory. The memory effect is further aided by period details which movies usually forget altogether when presenting fairly recent history. True to its time period the film has every woman sporting 80s-style big hair. In fact in retrospect that big hair looks pretty good. So does Billy Bob Thornton who as time goes on is developing an uncanny resemblance to the young Jimmy Carter. Here he plays coach Gary Gaines a man who combines a fierce determination to win with an odd equanimity of spirit. Thats an unusual combination but a natural for Thornton who can seem high-strung and mellow almost simultaneously. The 1988 season finds the coach with a team thats talented but small a liability he hopes to overcome through speed. At the center of his strategy is a runner named Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) a cocky kid who seems destined for big things. But when Boobie is injured early on the plans have to be redrawn. Boobies story becomes one not of triumph but of the agony of being on the outside looking in. Though Berg and the other screenwriters (Buzz Bissinger and David Aaron Cohen) make us care about who wins we never care as much as the characters do. Thus were able to see that the importance of high school football in this towns life is simply outsized. Nothing is more important than football. As far as everyone in the movie (except the coach) is concerned life is one long miserable slog interrupted only by a brief season under the lights. The kids feel the pressure to make the memories theyll take through life and to provide vicarious satisfaction for a lot of bored unhappy adults. Its not a healthy arrangement. ""You dont understand"" says country music star Tim McGraw who plays Billingsley the abusive father of one of the boys. ""This is the only thing youre ever gonna have."" And of course it is if your whole idea of success is so circumscribed as to see high school glory as the greatest thing to aspire to. ""Friday Night Lights"" beautifully conveys that limitation of vision. When the coach drives home he listens to himself being criticized on local call-in radio. In a parking lot two older townspeople imply that hell be fired if ""we"" dont win. Cant these people get a life? Though as adults theyre expected to remember their year on the team as ecstatic the players mostly look miserable coping with all kinds of stresses from within and without. Tension is the base note of Lucas Blacks performance as the quarterback and anguish is that of Garrett Hedlunds performance as young Billingsley. Less about sports this is a compelling movie about kids being enlisted into a towns mass neurosis. Advisory Some sexual activity and strong language.

The only newcomers showing the potential to break out are ""Bionic Woman"" and ""Private Practice"" two mediocre hours that are respectively violent and ditsy. Viewers have favored returning series. Thats good news for one of the very best dramas on television NBCs ""Friday Night Lights"" launching its second season at 8 tonight on Channel 9. The beautifully conceived story - again Not About Football - continues to delve into its rich characters as it disdains cliches tackles questions of blame and responsibility and details how very lost lives can become even within the tight parameters of small-town Texas patriotism and sports allegiances. No spoilers here but theres a twist at the end of tonights hour of ""Friday Night Lights"" that will reverberate through the season. This is cause for concern The addition of a sustained mystery not to mention the sight of teens jumping through windows to meet sex partners could render ""Friday Night Lights"" more like every other show. Still if it makes the story more accessible for those who crave a more literal narrative without altering the basic nature of the series Im for it. As the season opens Panther coach Eric Taylor (Kyle Chandler) has left Dillon to take a job coaching college football at TMU. His wife Tami (Connie Britton) is about to have a baby and their daughter Julie (Aimee Teegarden) is feeling alternately trapped and overlooked. Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly) has found Jesus; Julie has found life beyond boyfriend Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford); Buddy Garity (Brad Leland) is drinking; and Tyra (Adrianne Palicki) and Landry (Jesse Plemmons) are hanging out. ""Smash"" Williams is loving the limelight and Jason Street (Scott Porter) the wheelchair-bound former football star is finding satisfaction in coaching. The phenomenal Britton does terrific work in the first three hours of the season as the wildly hormonal overextended coachs wife. The story arcs dare to treat small-town American life in all its solemn complexity. The characters rise above inert cutouts each following a journey for better and worse worth taking. New to the cast is Daniella Alonso as Carlotta a fetching live-in Latina caretaker for Matts mother who may pose a dilemma or perhaps an opportunity for Matt. From the start the writers have used the admirable but complicated marriage at the heart of the series to anchor the action. Unfortunately the pair do too much talking on cellphones in the early hours this season. The sooner they can be reunited the better for the story not to mention the marriage. On the sidelines an ongoing source of angst and pride is the towns self-defining relationship with its high-school athletes. Is it possible they might go to State? The communal desire to ""go to State"" translates to Be Something or perhaps find a reason for living. Panther pride means never having to say youre sorry. But this year the individuals are separately and collectively being swept toward a realization At some point somebody has got to step up and take responsibility. For decisions for mistakes for themselves.

Friday Night Lights Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/friday-night-lights-2004,200,fridaynightlights16,fridaynightlights,rogerebert
"In Friday Night Lights the football film goes deep - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Friday Night Lights the football film goes deep By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 8 2004 ""Friday Night Lights"" has an arresting poster probably the best for any movie all year. Three high school football players stand side by side on the 50-yard line helmeted with their backs to the viewer. Theyre facing the far-off packed stands and two floodlight towers. The men clasp hands and they all have a leg thats bent at the knee and pulled slightly back.Whats striking about the picture is its symmetry and ambiguity. The men could be dancers bowing at a curtain call. When exactly in a game does a moment like this happen? Theres no football no cheerleaders no grunting no blood sweat or tears just that image which distills from a bruising sport this note of elegance.In the movie the scene from the poster lasts for two seconds and is a lot less ethereal but the film itself is often just as lyrical if more melancholy. It contains all the stuff so beautifully absent from the photo the essential things like testosterone referees and the game itself. But it also bears something you rarely experience in a football movie. ""Friday Night Lights"" has a soul.Set in the Odessa Texas of 1988 a place of ubiquitous oil drills and a seeming cultural barrenness the movie recounts the true tale of the Permian Panthers and the teams quest for another state title. It walks the standard path that most underdog sports stories take to reach a kind of ragged glory. Theres the cocky star running back (Derek Luke) the shy quarterback (Lucas Black grown up and quite good) with a sick mom (Connie Cooper) and the butterfingers receiver (Garrett Hedlund) with the abusive drunk dad (Tim McGraw the country star). Billy Bob Thornton compassionate in a cooperative hairpiece plays the coach and here and there we see Connie Britton as his supportive wife.There are recruiters unseen commentators running play by plays lots of time in the locker room and the nagging desperation of a town with a population thats counting on the Panthers to make it to the state championships. Theres not much in ""Friday Night Lights"" that you havent ever seen or couldnt have imagined. Relative to most Hollywood sports movies however it just feels new.The film is based on the moving book the landfaring journalist H.G. ""Buzz"" Bissinger wrote more than a decade ago. Director Peter Berg working with expensive-looking production draws out these lives so you can see how the sport as its typically said of Lone Star football is the regional religion. (In one of the opening scenes a mother runs plays with her son at breakfast.)You rarely sense the screenplay which Berg wrote with David Aaron Cohen pushing characters to act although Lukes performance might be too showy even for a gridiron diva. But after his character is injured in the seasons first game and he realizes his life in football might be over Luke has a weepy collapse that actually fills you with sadness for his busted dreams.The picture toys with time skipping from the present to a few seconds of something that happened an hour or a day before. This doesnt deepen the meaning but it does lend considerable atmosphere which is further enriched by the excellent drums-and-guitar score from the art band Explosions in the Sky. Its rumbling steroidal and wistful -- sometimes during the same game. Bergs impressionistic approach (a flurry of scenes in the service of a mood) finally answers what millions of men have probably been dying to know how a Terrence Malick football movie might go. ""Friday Night Lights"" is very much in the plaintive key of Malicks World War II ballad ""The Thin Red Line."" This movie is just shorter and less sensual.Berg once played the bad-boy doctor on ""Chicago Hope"" then he made 1998s morally disgusting ""Very Bad Things."" Surprisingly his second movie last years muscular playful ""The Rundown"" showed improvement It stuck Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson in the jungle. ""Friday Night Lights"" is a logical next choice He seems to be making a name for himself as a director of commercial movies for extremely virile yet openly sensitive men. He doesnt have Malicks artistry in him (hes too transparent) but hes not nearly the bullying hack Tony Scott (""Man on Fire"") is either.In fact he seems on the verge of revitalizing the male weepie. When the star quarterback throws a spiral to a gang of eager football-whipped kids it feels like hes just tossed them a very hard very fast leather bouquet.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Lights shines on gritty reality of footballBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Anyone who grew up in a football town will find Friday Night Lights dead on as actor-turned-director Peter Berg portrays the subculture of the Texas high school gridiron. Life basically boils down to win or die a mind-set that H.G. Bissingers superb 1990 book of the same name got right. Gridiron glory Billy Bob Thornton plays a tough but fair high school coach in Texas where prep football is almost a religion. Universal Studios The movie feels authentic though you can sympathize with studio marketers trying to sell it as far more rah-rah than it is. So clinically objective that its almost (but finally not) chilly and detached Lights portrays the checkered 1988 season at Odessa-Permian High School. The players families have gotten no breaks post-football prospects are drab and those oil derricks just dont look as majestic as they do in Giant. About the movie Friday Night Lights    1/2 (out of four) Stars Billy Bob Thornton Derek Luke Lucas Black Tim McGraw Garrett Hedlund Directors Peter Berg Distributor Universal Rated PG-13 for thematic issues sexual content language some teen drinking and rough sports action. Opens Friday nationwide Billy Bob Thornton really on a roll these days is part of an ensemble not the main event. Blessed with an infectiously hot-doggish running back (Derek Luke) Coach Gaines and his star both learn (though weathered Gaines surely knows it already) how perilously the fortunes of a community can turn on torn cartilage. Unconventionally non-linear by Hollywood sports-pic standards the movie offers so many snippets of tightly assembled details that it wouldnt be surprising to hear that it was sculpted in the editing room. We get the boosters and their not-so-veiled job threats such as the ""for sale"" signs that prankishly end up on a coachs front lawn after a loss and the radio commentators who perpetually second-guess. Though his film is largely impressionistic Berg gets some stirring performances starting with Thorntons sometimes tough-tempered but fair leader who must instill confidence when hes not so assured himself. Luke and Lucas Black (as the team quarterback) are supporting standouts as is singer Tim McGraw as the boozy father of a player his own football star long faded. One of the best football movies ever Nights in the end celebrates the game. But its unspoken subtext is still loud enough to make you wonder What happens to the kid in this community who wants to listen to show tunes?

"Friday Night Lights | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; friday-night-lights ) Friday Night Lights (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli If you go to this movie based solely on how it is being portrayed in the trailers and advertisements you will probably be expecting a feel-good romp through familiar territory - a football version of Hoosiers. Like nearly all sports movies Friday Night Lights is about redemption; however instead of wallowing in clichA(c)s Peter Bergs film uses them sparingly. This movie is less about what happens on the field than in the hearts of the players. And while it is ultimately an emotionally fulfilling experience it doesnt hide the ugliness in an effort to lionize the characters. The story which is based on true events as related in Buzz Bissingers best-selling book Friday Night Lights A Town a Team and a Dream follows the 1988 football season of the Odessa-Permian Panthers one of the elite high school clubs of West Texas. This is die-hard football country where stores close so everyone in town can attend the game. Sunday morning is for church. Friday night is for football. There are hopes for an undefeated season. The state championship is almost a given. With a player as talented as James ""Boobie"" Miles (Derek Luke) the concept of a loss is inconceivable - until Boobie goes down with a severe knee injury in the first game. Suddenly his supporting cast including quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) and running backs Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) and Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young) must step up. The teams coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) alternately endures the bile and the praise of the town. When the Panthers are winning he can do no wrong. But when the Panthers are losing he is persona non grata. Subplots abound and these are what enrich Friday Night Lights brew. After all when it comes to the on-field action there are only so many variations on a theme. The films soul may be closer to Rocky than Hoosiers or The Natural but there are still plenty of the expected ""big"" moments such as when the underachiever makes an important play and when the strong silent leader fuels a comeback. But while there is triumph in Friday Night Lights it doesnt always come where its expected. All of the Panthers are dogged by high expectations. Most sports movies are about the underdog coming out of nowhere to achieve a victory. Friday Night Lights is about the pressure to win. Boobie gets a painful life lesson when he sees a promising future vanish in an instant. This teenager who had always imagined that his talent would take him to the NFL stares resignedly at a group of garbage men making their morning rounds. Mike a natural mamas boy must shake his natural reticence and become a leader. Win or lose he must learn to grow up. And Don has to resolve the love-hate relationship he has with his drunken father (Tim McGraw) who savored a measure of success two decades ago as a member of a champion Panthers team and wants the same for his son. Two things lend Friday Night Lights an aura of verisimilitude the choice of actors and the manner in which Berg and cinematographer Tobias A. Schliessler have chosen to present the narrative. The films style is documentary-like. It is shot using hand-held cameras with slightly desaturated color and an image that often looks more like it was captured on video than on celluloid. This is not a pretty movie although it is effective in what it intends to do. Likewise the decision to use fresh faces relieves us from having to lay baggage at the feet of any of the actors (except perhaps Billy Bob Thornton who disappears chameleon-like into his role). Some of them are in the midst of starting fertile careers (like Derek Luke who previously played the lead character in Antwone Fisher and is wonderful here) but none is established to the extent his reputation gets in the way of us being able to fully accept him as his character. Friday Night Lights is being hailed by some critics as the best sports movie ever made. While I think that is hyperbole Bergs picture is certainly an above average effort that provides a solid emotional punch. The difference between this film and many of those that have come before it is one of perspective. In most sports pictures the big game at the end is the point. Its why were in the theater and what we have been waiting for. Here the game is just a means by which what really matters comes into focus. And thats sufficient to set apart Friday Night Lights.

"Thornton Scores a Touchdown washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Thornton Scores a Touchdown Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 8 2004 BEFORE I BEGIN a bit of full disclosure. As my layout editor noted the other day with some dismay the Weekend sections two main options for reviewing the new football movie ""Friday Night Lights"" were in her succinct summation ""the Brit"" (meaning my colleague Desson Thomson for whom ""football"" inevitably means soccer) and ""the geek"" (meaning you guessed it me a four-eyed Poindexter who also reviews -- gasp -- art on the side). Imagine her surprise then not to mention my own when I liked it. Thats because ""Friday Night Lights"" is not really a ""football movie"" in the conventional sense. Its more of a ""life movie"" that happens to be about football. The game in its refreshingly jaundiced view is not portrayed as a kind of violent religion or obsession -- well it is sort of but not purely or gloriously so -- or some grand metaphor for the human condition. Its more of a beautiful sickness and the films look of grainy jolting jump cuts; shaky hand-held camerawork; and blanched color make the movie feel like its got the DTs. The residents of Odessa Tex. where the film is set are mad for their high school team and that madness comes across less as an expression of some healthy all-American fandom than as a kind of addiction. Viscerally directed by Peter Berg the film doesnt just ask you to look at the monkey on the towns back but to feel its rabid bite. Based on the acclaimed nonfiction book by H.G. Bissinger ""Friday Night Lights"" charts the 1988 season of the Permian High School Panthers who that year would play for their fifth state championship in the small west Texas schools 30-year history. Filmed documentary-style with a verite urgency that careers with adrenaline from the locker room to the stands to the sidelines to the bedrooms kitchens and barbershops of the town the movie does not overly revere its subject which is precisely why it works so well. Oh it respects football and it understands football but it doesnt try to make the sport into something it is not which in the case of Odessa -- a town thats not that far away from the middle of nowhere -- is nevertheless everything. As star running back Boobie Miles (Derek Luke) puts it ""The subject is football. Aint no other subject."" Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton looking alternately stoic fierce and scared for his own skin when he starts losing games after Boobie is injured) would have his team of prematurely aged youths learn otherwise before its too late. ""Do you feel 17?"" asks tailback Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) whose abusive alcoholic father (country singer Tim McGraw) cant seem to forget his own long-dead gridiron glory days. ""I dont feel 17"" says quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) a kid who never smiles until close to the films end he throws his football away like a curse. What Gaines wants his boys to know is that life continues after loss and that being to use his term ""perfect"" is not about the final score but about doing your best. Thats right. This isnt a winning-isnt-everything-its-the-only-thing movie. Yes in the end it does all come down to One Big Game -- and its a bloody bone-crunching nail-biter against the bigger meaner and dirtier team from Dallass Carter High -- but if you havent read the book or you dont know the historical outcome the ending might actually surprise you. Like the final game itself the movie is full of both crushing disappointment and hope resignation and joy ugliness and great beauty. ""Friday Night Lights"" is honest because it gets a paradoxical truth Theres more to life than football even when there isnt. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS (PG-13 110 minutes) -- Contains obscenity sexual content underage drinking emotionally abusive parenting often brutal gridiron action and occasional bouts of Texan talk so twangy you may wish there were subtitles.

Heck even those who dont love books about sports think H.G. Bissingers 1990 nonfiction account of the same name is one of the greatest stories ever told. Because football itself is almost beside the point in his acute nuanced report -- a psychological thriller really -- about national issues of American hope pride pressure and sense of proportion. The games won and lost by the Permian Panthers of Odessa Texas Permian High School during the 1988 season in their quest to capture the fifth Texas state championship in their 30-year history are not in the end important. What simultaneously chills and warms are the sharp winds of racial and class conflict desperation and community resolve dead-endedness and opportunity that Bissinger sniffs in the dry Texas air and describes so vividly in the course of his yearlong chronicle. The movie adaptation directed with smart documentary-style briskness by Peter Berg (The Rundown) from a limber screenplay by Berg and David Aaron Cohen (The Devils Own) inevitably cedes some subtlety of sociology and reporterly description in favor of fast-cut sports action Stuff has got to move on screen motion-picture style while stuff can more easily just be in the pages of a book. Plus theres always got to be a coda apparently trumpeted like a sappy school anthem. (Not in my playbook mind but clearly in that of the Hollywood-gridiron system.) Still Friday Night Lights the movie retains the integrity of Bissingers book. And the greatest measure of its honesty may be that even when Billy Bob Thornton playing Coach Gary Gaines gives his players the films highpoint sermon during the teams crucial last halftime -- ""I want you to put each other in your hearts forever because forever is about to happen"" he preaches -- the coach himself doesnt dominate the game. Looking into the battered faces of his young men in the locker room or going eyeball-to-eyeball with the town bigwigs who demand a state championship with all the gentleness of a death threat Thornton giving a splendid disciplined performance seamlessly shapes his coach into a believable man of quality rather than star-size charisma. No one player dominates the game on Bergs playing field not even star running back James ""Boobie"" Miles personified in a blaze of brio by Antwone Fishers Derek Luke. And although some games are naturally more important than others as the mostly white Panthers scramble their way toward a do-or-die showdown with the massively built mostly black steamrollers of the Dallas Carter Cowboys no single matchup lingers in the air as the ""point"" of it all. There are no miracles on the field here; the chant ""USA USA"" is superfluous. (The Panthers are boosted along by chants of ""Mo-Jo Mo-Jo"") This is Heartland USA or a reasonable facsimile of it freed from thundering horn music to muck it up. Instead the season goes the way the season goes -- aint nothin hip hip hooray thrown in to tamper with reality. The running back is injured. The quarterback (a perfectly intense Lucas Black first memorably teamed with Thornton eight years ago in Sling Blade) feels trapped in Odessa by the very air molecules around him. The tailback (Garrett Hedlund) fights his wreck of a father (Grammy winner Tim McGraw potent in his first Hollywood role) a bully for whom winning a state championship was both the high point and end of his own blighted dreams. And at every step Berg (by happenstance hes Bissingers second cousin) and his prowling DP commercial cinematographer Tobias Schliessler rely on rough handheld shots of flat landscape industrial nothingness and the exertions of spangled cheerleaders to convey as much about wins and losses as any human-interest subplots. Its a happy/sad circumstance that Berg took on the movie -- an adaptation long in the works -- after the 1998 death of the projects original helmer Alan J. Pakula. Fortunately the ball has been passed to a player who understands that Friday Night Lights is about how life is a game and a game can be life.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Sports Billy Bob Thornton Texas or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- ""Friday Night Lights"" is set in the town of Odessa Texas located on the flat windswept plains of the state.Odessa is a hard-scrabble oil industry hub best known for one thing a championship high school football team the Permian Panthers. Every young man in Odessa who can possibly play ball carries the expectation of being part of that legendary team.They have to have those hopes. Being on the Permian Panthers is not only a ticket to winning but often a ticket out to the wider world.""Friday Night Lights"" tries to capture not only the ground-level football but the hopes and dreams of its characters the school and the town. Its about the importance of giving yourself over to something greater than yourself as an individual being part of a group striving for a common dream.It mostly succeeds.Billy Bob Thornton one of the movies most accomplished character actors plays real-life coach Gary Gaines. The coach is a dedicated family man under mind-shattering pressure by both the school board and the entire town of Odessa to bring home Permians fifth state championship in its 30-year history. Hed better; he failed to do so in his first two seasons as coach and Permian expects winners.Thornton -- whose father in real life was a basketball coach -- carries the role with style and grace. His character is the emotional core of the team.Star playersBut ""Friday Night Lights"" is a true ensemble piece and Thorntons star wattage doesnt overpower the film. The real stars of this story are the players themselves and to a great extent the town of Odessa.Lucas Black plays Mike Winchell the quiet uncertain quarterback upon whose shoulders so many expectations rides. He has worked with Thornton two times before; first in the Oscar-winning film ""Sling Blade"" later in the Thornton-directed ""All the Pretty Horses."" Hes grown both as a man and as an actor.Also of note is Garrett Hedlund who plays Don Billingsley the son of a man who lives his life through his son trying to recapture his own memories of his former glory days playing for the Panthers. Billinglseys father is played with great authority by country singer Tim McGraw in his first starring role.To call football an obsession for the folks of Odessa would be a mighty understatement. For these people the game and what it represents isnt just a sport; it symbolizes the American dream. Authenticity Tim McGraw plays an overbearing parent to Garrett Hedlund in the film.The 1990 H. G. ""Buzz"" Bissinger book on which the movie is based caused a minor scandal in Odessa. Many townsfolk believed the book criticized the towns obsession with the game of football to the detriment of its academic standards. You cant underestimate the hatred the town still has for the book.Director Peter Berg -- who happens to be a second cousin of Bissinger -- has carefully avoided those pitfalls with an outstanding screenplay written along with David Aaron Cohen. Though a lot of the dodging was done by concentrating on what happens at the line of scrimmage the film still offers a knowing look at the town and its culture.Bergs use of a hand-held camera and the gritty look of the film also add greatly to the authenticity of the action.""Friday Night Lights"" will be classified as a sports film but it has none of the glossy sheen given most of that genre. Its better that that -- better than a simple ride to whats often a foregone conclusion. ""Lights"" feels real honest and -- most of all -- heartfelt and its filled with good performances and a fine spirit.""Friday Night Lights"" opens nationwide on Friday and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

With the Dillon High School graduates now entering the real world a new group of student-athletes have arrived in this football crazy Texas town. Like a team with an influx of freshmen the fourth season of ""Friday Night Lights"" arrives at a transitional juncture. Series returning on satcaster DirecTV but relegated to summer 2010 duty on NBC finished last year with what could easily have been a series-ending storyline and now faces the additional challenge of maintaining a high level of quality despite showrunner Jason Katims splitting exec producer duties between this and the Peacocks ""Parenthood."" Since the pilot Katims has been the creative force of ""FNL"" and first episode signals he still has lots of original storylines to be mined. Most notable is the change of scenery for Coach Eric Taylor (the always stellar Kyle Chandler) who despite winning a state title has been forced out of his old job and reassigned to take over as coach of dilapidated rival East Dillon. Many of his players -- a majority are minorities with the school in a depressed part of town that has far fewer acoutrements than Dillon High -- are unwilling to put in the effort needed to become a well-rounded team and Taylor is clearly starting from scratch. Just how much Katims and his writers will include former Panthers quarterback Matt Saracen (Zach Gilford) and running back Tim Riggins (Taylor Kitsch) on upcoming episodes remains to be seen. Both are still meandering in Dillon post-graduation -- Riggins discovers he and higher education arent a good fit -- and having Saracen deliver pizzas after turning down a college scholarship is almost too sad to ponder. Storylines on those two feel a bit played out while new characters are intriguing and help the show remain vibrant. Vince Howard (Michael B. Jordan) is one step away from being locked up in juvenile detention before Coach Taylor gives him an opportunity to get off the streets and reinvent himself on the field. Shows minscule budget has turned into one of its greatest assets using real-life Austin locales and citizens to bring an authenticity that only adds to the drama. One doesnt have to be a soothsayer to figure out the season is heading toward a showdown between Dillon and East Dillon. Yet what has made ""FNL"" so riveting over its run is that while the town is football obsessed nothing that happens between the goalposts is as compelling as the journey before the lights go on.
