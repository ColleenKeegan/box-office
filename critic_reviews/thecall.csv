"The Week in Movies Answering The Call and the Soporific Powers of Burt Wonderstone << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com The Week in Movies Answering The Call and the Soporific Powers of Burt Wonderstone Sony Halle Berry March 14 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes all people in an audience want is to be wanted even when theyre not. They get desperate to stop minding their own business and start minding a movies instead. For instance when a teenage girls been snatched from a mall parking lot and thrown into a trunk then comes this close to being rescued by a stranger some people in the audience think that girl needs some encouragement. So they yell to her ""Scream bitch. Scream"" Even after a cut to the inside of the truck reveals that the girls abductor is ready to impale her cheek with a screwdriver were she to scream some people in the audience need her to take that risk anyway. God willing every audience for The Call will have that person who thinks hes just on the phone with a friend or stuck in traffic or totally by himself in the theater. They dont make enough thrillers like this anymore ones you can talk to ones that uncannily enough seem to listen. The night I saw the movie when one character drops a phone about 15 feet into a shaft someone in the audience said ""Damn I would have to go down there and get that."" And down into the shaft the character went. This is a cleverly made smartly written totally satisfying armrest-gripper that begins in a Los Angeles 911 call center where a veteran named Jordan Turner makes the rookie mistake of calling back a teenager who thinks her assailant has left the house. The bad guy hears the phone ring and the teen winds up dead. Because Jordan is played by Halle Berry the murder makes her do things like fan her teary eyes and doubt her skill. It Haunts Her. Six years later Jordans removed herself from the call center floor and leads training sessions for aspiring operators. But its just like the James Brown routine where somebody puts a cape over him because hes too tired to go on then he pops throws off the cape and keeps performing. Thats Halle Berry in The Call. During one of Jordans training tours the movie cuts away to two teens walking around a mall. One leaves. The other Casey (Abigail Breslin) is left to walk to her car alone where shes promptly stuffed into the trunk by a lunatic. Luckily she has her friends disposable cell phone and calls 911 where an operator is standing by. Eventually that operator becomes Jordan who tries to avoid taking the call the way you avoid having someone pass you the phone when whoevers on the other end is the last person youd ever want to talk to. Jordans eyes well right up with post-traumatic stress but she pulls herself together and gets Casey to stop mewling and whining and shrieking. Kick out the taillights. Theres paint back there with you? Pour it through the hole where the taillight was. At some point early on while Caseys freaking out Jordan learns that theyre both Capricorns. ""Were fighters"" the woman tells the girl. Thats the moment I knew The Call would hit the spot. Its a line you put on a mental Post-it. Like 2004s Cellular another enjoyable chiller built around crime and mobile technology The Call is the rare horror film in the last decade or so to forgo metaphysics the supernatural and source material that was first a hit in Asia. Lately its just a bunch of computer-generated effects crying wolf. Until someone finds a way to make us truly afraid again of ghosts and demonic possessions were fine being scared by stuff that happens on Nancy Grace and Criminal Minds. The director of The Call is Brad Anderson; Richard DOvidio wrote the script. Anderson began in the mid-1990s in independent romances (Next Stop Wonderland Happy Accidents) and has settled into a balance of chillers (Session 9 The Machinist) and television series. For this movie he finds a way of turning a fairly conventional abduction thriller into something visually scary. He attaches the digital cameras to reclining medical chairs and doors. He puts them right up close to some of the actors until their faces start to warp. It feels like Danny Boyles recent dizzy overcaffeinated style. This funhouse approach gives earthbound activity a ghostly webcam gloss that enhances the usual close-quarters intimacy and atmospheric suspense that Andersons good at. It also helps that the abductor (Michael Eklund) seems appreciably insane without ever settling for anonymous bogeyman tics. Hes handsome but in a way that makes you nervous about showing up for that second date. The Calls peppered with good side-dish actors -- Justina Machado Jose Zuniga Roma Maffia and Morris Chestnut as a cop whos dating Berrys character and is the rare man in a movie who knows how to hold the star. But the main attraction is the bond between Berry and Breslin who seems even mightier with a memorably swollen eye. Berry needs more of these ""dont mess with me"" movies. She has nothing to lose anymore. Until she can find a decent comedy or a great movie well take her in these pretty good ones as long as she doesnt turn herself into prey or bait or eye candy. What we sense from her is strength and what we like is to see her strong -- and with better wigs (the springy geometric number she wears here says ""I get so emotional""). When she repeats the abductors tagline back to him theres nowhere else for The Call to go so it rightly sends us home high. But not before letting us pelt Berry with our two cents. At some point the other night someone yelled ""Dont go in there"" as she proceeded to go right on in. If this movie is half the hit it deserves to be Berry needs to defy the peanut gallery and go in there over and over again. In The Incredible Burt Wonderstone Steve Carell has big hair and a pale kind of tan. Its as if someone covered him in Doritos dust and put him in the oven. He plays the Las Vegas magician of the title a pompous diva whose creaky casino show becomes passe and whose professional partnership with Anton Marvelton (Steve Buscemi) hits the skids. Anton leaves Vegas to bring magic to indigent Cambodians (one girl tries to bite his box of tricks) and the Trumpy owner of the casino Doug Munny (James Gandolfini) first fires Burt then considers hiring an ""edgy"" sadomasochist named Steve Gray (Jim Carrey) whose approach to magic is like a tornados approach to real estate. Will Burt get back on top? Will he and Anton have rapprochement? Will Steve die in the middle of one of his stunts? I didnt care. At some point Burt falls so far from riches fame and sold-out performances that hes performing at a retirement home and a kids garden party and is being coached by his crusty boyhood idol (Alan Arkin). Needless to say with these two when it comes to rediscovering the joy of magic the student becomes the teacher. But the best material in the movie -- the moments in which the comedy has teeth and tension -- come when it pits Burts good wholesome magic against Steves grossness and self-mutilation. At that point of course Burt Wonderstone is no longer a satire of magic shows in Vegas. Its an allegory for comedy in Hollywood. And theres some wit in having Carrey send up Jackass-style stunts (in one he holds his urine for 24 straight hours; in another he drills a hole in his head). But as fun as Carrey is its a joke that feels at least 10 years too late. The director Don Scardino is a veteran of 30 Rock and he can do a lot with reaction shots and crowd scenes. He orchestrates some funny bits around Carells idea of superstar pompousness to play Burt like hes Morticia Addams. Fired and broke he moves himself and the contents of his hotel suite into the tiny apartment of his ex-assistant (Olivia Wilde whose exasperation makes her seem reassuringly human). She makes him a nice fish dinner and without finishing the meal he picks up the plates and puts them outside her front door the way he must have at his hotel. But John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein have written a script that seems so scared of not being a hit that it forgets to be a movie. These two also wrote Horrible Bosses which was like a Steve Gray trick stretched to an hour and a half. Burt Wonderstone is desperate to remind you of the importance of humility and friendship and belief. Its desperate to make you care about characters who dont deserve it. But since every funny moment here involves cynicism arrogance heartlessness and self-destruction you never believe the movie when its telling you how nice and contrite these characters are. The best gag comes at the very end and involves members of the audience being dragged unconscious up aisles and heaved into a pile in a moving van. Its a very funny sequence thats also pretty mean They think the unconscious pile is us.

Experienced operator Halle Berry loses it when she feels she could have done more to prevent the brutal murder of a teenage girl. But her shot at redemption arrives swiftly when the same killer kidnaps a fresh victim (Abigail Breslin) who manages to call the emergency services from inside the boot of a moving vehicle. Since the audience shares Berrys sense of anguished powerlessness this is highly effective as suspense and milked effectively by astute indie mainstay Brad Anderson (The Machinist Transsiberian) during a gripping extended chase. Yet just when the movie has us in its grasp the script falls to pieces and turns into a crass female-in-peril button-pusher whose shameless psycho-killer cliches insult the intelligence.

Theres an argument to be had about whether serial-killer movies should ever be easy to watch but when Anderson starts shoving a fish-eye lens into Breslins terrified face it feels less like autocritique and more like an attempt to out-deprave Criminal Minds. Fairs fair however Crude as it is The Call milks its jump scares and dont-go-down-to-the-basement tension for all theyre worth. See it with a full house if you absolutely must see it at all.

(Greg Gayne) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday March 15 2013 600 AM Title The Call Film Info Director Brad Anderson (130). R Gruesome violence. Area theaters. Lets call ""The Call"" what it is high quality trash that both diminishes and is redeemed by all the talents who have deigned to bring it to life. Which is a fancy way of saying ""Halle Berry you have an Oscar. Why are you still making junk?"" Still at least this is well-crafted junk which is a step up for the star of ""Gothika"" ""Catwoman"" ""New Years Eve"" ""Dark Tide"" and ""Movie 43."" Director Brad Anderson whose experience runs from lauded indies (""Next Stop Wonderland"") to acclaimed TV (""The Wire"") has a firm handle on things for most of the movie which he structures as a taut thriller. Berry plays Jordan a 911 operator traumatized by a mishandled call from a teenage girl. When a similar emergency comes in months later shes determined to get it right. Casey (""Little Miss Sunshine"" Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin) is abducted by a sociopath (Michael Eklund) and thrown in a car trunk with only her cell for help. Jordan stays on the line as long as she can doing her best to extract clues and talk the terrified teen through potential escape plans. While she works in the 911 ""hive"" her LAPD boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) begins searching the city. Anderson does a great job building the tension between his limited locations. As long as were cutting from the car to the hive he keeps us on edge. Eventually though he makes the mistake of wandering out into the wilderness. We cover our eyes when Caseys in the car and roll them when Jordan goes searching for her in a deserted lair packed with torture equipment. Things only devolve from there. But Berry and Breslin do make a good team. Its easy to root for these talented actresses playing strong women determined to rescue themselves. (Even if the 15-year-old Breslin is required to rescue herself while shirtless a bit of cheap exploitation Anderson should have reconsidered.) No ones winning any awards for ""The Call."" But at least the award winners know how to make it worth our while. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Michael Eklund makes the most of the maniac role and Breslin is a sympathetic victim even if the most alarming thing about the movie may be seeing the girl from Little Miss Sunshine stripped down to her bra. Finally if youre going to watch a movie in which two people talk on the phone for most of the film its not the worst thing in the world for one of the folks involved to have the face of Storm from the X-Men.

"Call The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; call-the ) Call The (United States 2013) March 15 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note This review contains spoilers. It isnt possible to discuss the full breadth of The Calls stupidity without providing some specifics. Labeling The Call as ""relentlessly dumb"" would be an overestimation of its intelligence. This is as brain-dead as a movie can be and it assumes the audience will have the I.Q. of a rutabaga. I suspected I might be in trouble when the opening credits proudly proclaim that The Call is a ""WWE Production."" Uh-oh. Granted I wasnt expecting a high-caliber art film (although once upon a time Brad Anderson was an indie director - The Machinist anyone?) but the WWE isnt exactly known for gripping storylines and well-developed characters. The pedigree runs true. Things dont start out too badly. In fact they begin with a whiff of verisimilitude. I dont know what a 911 call center looks like but I can believe its something similar to whats shown in The Call. Were introduced to operator Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) who appears to be one of the best at what she does. Things take a turn for the worse for Jordan however when a caller is kidnapped as a result of a mistake Jordan makes. After the initial call is disconnected while the victim is hiding from her stalker Jordan foolishly hits the ""dial back"" button and the ringing of the phone alerts the intruder to the girls location. After this incident Jordan takes herself off the active roster and becomes a 911 instructor - until shes pressed back into emergency duty. The bulk of the movie follows a call from another kidnap victim Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) who is trapped in the trunk of her abductors car. The Calls intention is build suspense during these sequences but it misses the mark in generating tension. Mostly its just Casey whimpering and whining and the police showing a shocking lack of ability. Throw in some scenes of the nutso kidnapper (Michael Eklund) frothing at the mouth. There are some clever conceits such as when Jordan suggests Casey kick out a taillight and stick her arm through the resulting opening to attract attention. But the contrivances and coincidences which reach a fevered pitch during the final 30 minutes begin their germination here. My sense is that Anderson is trying to replicate the kind of taut claustrophobic intensity evident in the underappreciated Buried. If thats the case he fails completely. Both characters (victim and operator) are poorly realized. Their relationship is artificial and Jordan comes across as unprofessional breaking every one of the ""rules"" she teaches operators to follow. (Dont get personally involved dont make promises you cant keep etc.) The Call goes off the rails as it approaches the climax. Once the call with Casey is terminated at a critical juncture Jordan decides to take matters into her own hands. So distrusting the police departments ability to get the job done she goes on a one-woman hunt for the missing girl and incredibly finds her Yes shes a regular Ms. Sherlock Holmes. Then upon discovering the psychos lair does she call for backup? No - she dont need no stinkin backup (The screenplays lame attempt to provide logic for this decision is a laughably absurd.) Horror movie scream queens everywhere would welcome Jordan into their ranks. She commits all the classic idiot-blunders of those characters including the biggest one of all turning her back on a supposed ""downed"" killer. Now we all know that these guys always get up. Doesnt she watch Jason Michael Krueger movies? By whining and being generally unconvincing Abigail Breslin quickly got on my nerves. I was a little surprised to discover how much she has matured since that last time I recall seeing her (Zombieland). I mean she has breasts. Now before accusing me of being a sexist pig consider that Anderson elects to highlight this physiological fact by having Breslin spend the last quarter of the movie in her bra. Theres no doubt she is being presented as a sex object (and dont give me any crap about it being ""necessary to the story""). Halle Berry on the other hand is allowed to keep her shirt on. This is expected Hollywood (or should I say the WWE) is a lot more interested in the breasts of 17-year olds than those of 46-year olds. I am willing to credit The Call for one thing. In the sea of mediocre movies represented by the first quarter of the year this successfully calls attention to itself by being just plain bad. This is one of those films thats ripe for mockery. It can be lampooned and ridiculed and jeered at. It has little value as a serious drama or thriller but as an object of derision... Mystery Science 3000 was made for efforts like this one.

The preteen who calls 911 because her parents sent her to her room. The angry fast-food customer who calls because his fries are cold. The toddler who calls 911 -- twice -- just because he likes the pattern the numbers make on the phone. (That was my kid by the way and Im sorry.) The people who work the phone banks have heard all those stories. But they know the other calls too. Like the one Jordan just got The one from a teenage girl terrified because a man just broke into her house. The kind of call that ends in screams and a dial tone. Its the kind of call Jordan never wants to get again. And then six months later she does. What happens next is a very tense hour or so as the teen on the other end of Jordans line manages to stammer out whats happening -- a man chloroform a shove into the trunk of a car. Theyre driving somewhere now. She doesnt know where. She doesnt know what to do. But Jordan does. So does Brad Anderson a director with an interesting career arc. He first got attention for his tart Sundance romance ""Next Stop Wonderland."" Then he accumulated art-house cred for ""The Machinist"" the movie that first showed how intense Christian Bale could be. Since then though Andersons movies have been smart genre pieces -- which frankly have been a treat for smart genre fans. Tautly made and with unusually good casts his films put new spins on old scares. ""Transsiberian"" was an Orient-Express-style mystery. ""Vanishing on 7th Street"" mixed end-of-the-world panic with ghostly touches and references to the Rapture. ""The Call"" mostly continues in that offbeat pattern. It has a good lead in Halle Berry who plays Jordan with her usual close-to-the-surface emotion; although its been a spotty and disappointing dozen years since her Oscar for ""Monsters Ball"" the woman can still bring it. And Abigail Breslin is good as the resilient nice-girl abductee although her work is nearly undone by bad-guy Michael Eklund. Clearly he made all his acting choices early -- and badly. (""Lets see Im a psycho so that means I twitch and stare and let my mouth hang open."") Its a shame Anderson didnt re-direct him and re-shape the material more. If we mostly stayed in that 911 operations center ""The Call"" could almost be brilliant. (Imagine if we never left it at all and had to guess at what was happening offscreen.) Of course thats not ""cinematic""; the old playbook insists we cut back and forth to the crime. Whats more cliched though is that eventually the script forces Berry to actually physically get involved in the hunt. And whats really distasteful is that toward the end the kidnapper rips off Breslins shirt for no good reason -- or rather for the sole reason that the camera can now focus not only on a terrified teen but on one in her brassiere. Sex and horror have always gone together but in an otherwise smart movie -- and from a director whose movies often feature strong female characters -- this kind of sleazy pandering is particularly disappointing. Try to look past it though and youll find a movie with two smart actresses a couple of good shocks (one of which had the whole audience screaming) and an unexpected ending. Its not as good as some of other Andersons movies have been. But its a lot better than you might expect a movie like this to be. Ratings note The film contains violence gore strong language and disturbing material. The Call (R) Tristar (95 min.) Directed by Brad Anderson. With Halle Berry Abigail Breslin.

You know the sort of thriller that wasnt completely ridiculous an effort in the vein of ""Seven"" or ""The Silence of the Lambs"" an experience worthy of accolades. The tension was there the actors were willing and the stage was set for a well-executed suspense film. Sadly ""The Call"" is not that instead coming off as a very slick-looking exercise in getting an audience to disconnect from the content. Near the end people will laugh at the moments of peril that should be immersing them in terror. Jordan Turner (Halle Berry) is a 911 operator in Los Angeles her workplace a tension-filled ""hive"" that is considered the brain of first responders all across the city. The work environment it must be noted looks exceptionally cool a cross between NASA mission control and a tech start-up screens and blinking status lights signifying that work of import is being handled 24/7. Jordan fields a few calls some serious some silly and were introduced to the fast-paced and immensely stressful world of a 911 dispatcher. The opening scenes are especially strong mostly because this is a public service that almost never gets mentioned but also due to the gamblers mentality of each call. The next interaction could be a petty squabble or alternatively a life-threatening crisis requiring immediate intervention. Within a few minutes Jordan gets a call of the terrible variety a home invasion replete with screams and violence and from there on out ""The Call"" becomes completely frenetic. Six months later our favorite 911 operator finds herself voluntarily out of active duty and in a training role. Shes walking new recruits through the call center when another terrifying call comes in. All of her skills will now be put to the test or so ""The Call"" would have you believe. Major problems begin presenting themselves and this is the spot where ""The Call"" consciously decides to slowly drown itself in the tub. The very first sticking point is the massively coincidental nature of Jordans involvement in the call itself. Even if youre willing to give the film some slack the wave of logic bombs this portends will soon cause a viewer to question the entire enterprise. Plot-wise the second major action beat of ""The Call"" involves a massive police response helicopters multiple units assigned an amber alert - but all of it is orchestrated by ... well actually nothing. At the beginning of the call no one knows where Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is which way shes headed or has any clues which would even guide them in a general direction. And yet everyone speeds around like they have bees in their pants. While one might concede that police action isnt always focused there very easily could have been a line of dialogue that went something to the effect of ""She could be anywhere with this 15 mile corridor tell all officers to keep a look out for a suspicious looking blah blah blah."" Then after the initial imagery of the entire police force getting involved ""The Call"" decides to dial it back likely to up the simplicity level of the film. We are then treated to one cop driving around like a mad man. ""The Call"" wants you to figure that the safety and well-being of this little girl depends entirely upon one cop driving around in circles. The helicopter will only make cameo appearances from here on out and it offers all the helpful utility of a clown in floppy shoes. Well sure clearly everyone wants a story that is easy to follow and offers character development but to do so at the expense of any hope of a realistic film well that seems not so clever. ""The Call"" is a film where you can feel the puppet strings being pulled each and every characters motivation being derived from exactly what the script wants them to do. There is no life force no authenticity its a movie by proxy mixed with large amounts of ""just because"". 45 minutes into ""The Call"" you can tell its a movie that should last an hour. I actively wondered how they could possibly stretch the film out and then in horror I realized the plan. They were going to place generic time-wasting obstacles in front of all of the protagonists. In one instance a characters cell phone doesnt have service (natch) a groan-worthy device exacerbated by the fact that we just saw someone else make a call from the exact same spot. Then 20 minutes later service is magically restored in the exact same spot. Its a double whammy of awfulness. There are also plenty of times you might find yourself screaming at the screen ""Where are all the other policemen? Does Los Angeles only have one officer that they ask to do everything? Can we give him a raise and some rocket boots?"" There is also the rather large issue of the grand finale. Its preposterous on a level we havent seen since Christopher Guest was delivering genius mockumentaries. In the final moments of the film ""The Call"" manages to throw away any goodwill it hasnt already squandered going for a cheap thrill to ""wow"" people with. Its a surprise to be sure but so is finding a rotting fish in your desk. With this sledgehammer of an ending ""The Call"" officially stakes out a claim as a forgettable film to be lost to the ages once the weekend passes. Where do we end up with a film like ""The Call""? Some modicum of love must be given for a few elements the look is crisp the acting is solid and there are a few really poignant moments that drive home the thin line between life and death for those on the front lines of emergency services. Still even with all that ""The Call"" manages to falter a pretty remarkable feat given most movies of its ilk aspire to the very things ""The Call"" accomplishes. As it stands ""The Call"" is an active affront to logic placing us in a world we firmly know doesnt exist. Grade D+ Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and researched LAPD response times to verify one of the elements of ""The Call"".

You know things are dire when you find yourself thinking fondly of ol Buffalo Bill in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with his toy poodle and broken-tape-recorder voice. Nowadays any hack with a bottle of chloroform and an 80s pop fixation thinks hes a memorable serial killer. In the emptily unpleasant thriller ""The Call"" which may or may not be a paid advertisement for the good folks at 911 Halle Berry is our poor mans Clarice. Admittedly it would be nice to think every emergency operator is like Berrys Jordan tears trembling on her magnificent doe eyes as she feels your pain and tells you to sit tight the police are on their way. (Well in eight to 10 minutes. Hope things arent too dicey) But even 911 empaths like Jordan screw up once in a while; still distracted from a makeout sesh with her cop boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) Jordan inadvertently contributes to the murder of a teenage girl by an intruder. Six months later a hysterical call from the trunk of a car by Casey another teen (Abigail Breslin gamely blubbering) has a still-traumatized Jordan convinced the guy has struck again. ""The Call"" experiences a brief engaging upswing as Jordan and Casey race against time -- and a finite cellphone battery -- to piece together where the car is and attempt to alert other drivers (one of whom is a silver-haired Michael Imperioli cruising by to remind you of other superior odes to brute violence). Berry gives it her all reminding you why shes risen to greatness in better material (""Monsters Ball"") and remains so watchable even in dreck like this. Granted Casey is a scared-stiff adolescent but director Brad Anderson (""The Machinist"") has her making a belief-defying amount of bad decisions in that trunk. If it were me and I managed to smash a taillight and stick my hand out I might wave say until my freaking arm fell off. Not just a few times. But this is an awfully chilly LA a place where a killer (Michael Eklund) can bludgeon someone with a shovel in broad daylight next to the interstate and apparently no one is the wiser. So its not looking too good for Casey no matter how much (or little) she waves. Especially when Jordan starts asking her stuff like ""Whats your favorite movie?"" and comparing astrological signs. Nothing says youre in good law-enforcement hands like ""Hey Im a Capricorn too"" Soon enough we arrive where we always knew wed end up in a dank dripping cellar. (Just once a murderer couldnt do his dirty work in a finished basement? A nice rec room?) Cue the deep-seated psychosis the creepy shrine the chase wherein the bad guy being knocked to the ground might not mean hes actually dead. (Although if my screening audience is any indication this still throws people for a loop.) Ill say one thing for ""The Call"" Its ending is actually a bit of a surprise. Just when you think it couldnt get any stupider pow Ill be damned Hollywood you still have the power to blindside.

Starring Halle Berry Abigail Breslin Morris Chestnut Michael Eklund Michael Imperioli Director Brad Anderson Running time 135 Release Opened Mar 15 2013  Editorial Review A taut thriller gets hung up at the endBy Ann HornadayFriday March 15 2013""The Call"" a tense police procedural starring Halle Berry as a besieged 911 operator raises more than a few provocative questions Cant someone come up with screenwriting software that signals when a script has made the fatal slip from hyped-up suspense to sheer ludicrousness? Why would a director start a movie he clearly didnt know how to finish? And why on Gods green earth would anyone want to put one of the best haircuts in Hollywood under a bad poodle-cut wig? This isnt to say that ""The Call"" is devoid of value. Indeed for a good hour or so this classic girl-in-jeopardy ticktock obeys all of the fundamentals of the genre with convincing atmospherics taut pacing visceral action and a solid lead performance from Berry (bad hair day notwithstanding). As a seasoned emergency responder named Jordan Berry spends most of ""The Call"" glued to a chair in a Los Angeles Police Department call center nicknamed ""The Hive"" where a team of dedicated 911 operators handles everything from an errant bat in a bedroom to a double overdose to attempted murders and burglaries-in-progress. Early in the film Jordan takes a call from a terrified teenager that does not end well. Rattled she takes a position training new responders but she jumps into the breach when another young woman -- played by Abigail Breslin -- is abducted from a shopping mall parking lot. Director Brad Anderson (""The Machinist"" ""Transsiberian"") does a terrific job of establishing Jordans work culture (she has embarked on a romance with a colleague played by the handsome Morris Chestnut) and the warlike combination of bureaucratic ennui and white-knuckled anxiety that defines the psychic space that most 911 operators occupy. Perhaps unintentionally ""The Call"" even captures the shallow Southern California milieu in which its story takes place; when Breslins character sends a tearful last message to her parents she calls her mom the best in the world because ""she always gave me everything I ever wanted."" That touching ode to filial devotion is delivered in the trunk of a swiftly moving car where a lot of ""The Call"" takes place and where it gets a lot more crowded after an unexpected twist. Thats around the same time that the movie -- up until now a solid thriller -- hints that it seeks to join the ranks of ""Silence of the Lambs"" imitators predicated on graphic sadistic violence and imagining new ever more gruesome reasons to torture and murder young women (nudity optional). The twist in ""The Call"" is that Berrys character has no intention of allowing herself or her young charge to be a victim. That ethos of empowerment is commendable but by ""The Calls"" outlandish and weirdly perfunctory conclusion it feels less honorable than conveniently self-serving. Audiences may wind up cheering the vigilante manifesto that ""The Call"" morphs into but at some point theyll no doubt wish it made slightly better sense.Contain violence disturbing content and some profanity.

"Review Halle Berry is fierce in The Call but script needs 911 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Halle Berry is fierce in The Call but script needs 911Brad Andersons thriller finds Berrys 911 operator trying to help a kidnapped teen but the action devolves into formulaic genre.March 14 2013|By Sheri Linden Halle Berry stars in ""The Call."" (Greg Gayne Sony-TriStar...)Relegated to bit parts and off-screen voices in countless movies the 911 operator graduates to lead-role status in ""The Call"" with Halle Berry playing the heroic municipal employee.The semi-fresh thriller set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup. It buzzes along for a while the promising plot innovations inviting suspension of disbelief before by-the-numbers implausibility over-the-top valor and unsavory contrivances take over and the line goes dead.When Berrys Jordan Turner takes charge of an especially challenging call shes still shaken by her mishandling of an emergency that ended badly. Until circumstances force her back into the thick of it shes been taking a break from direct contact with the public and their shootings ODs and home invasions. Instead shes been training newbies at the Hive the thrumming call center where she works.PHOTOSA SXSWA 13 must-see filmsBerry who has a knack for finding the toughness beneath vulnerability and vice versa (and who deserves better roles) delivers a taut unfussy performance as a cops daughter whos dating a cop (Morris Chestnut in a minuscule role). She gets fine support from Denise Dowse as a co-worker and Roma Maffia as her supervisor.Jordan returns to the high-wire stress of the phones when teenager Casey (Abigail Breslin) calls from the trunk of a car having been abducted by a deranged man with a plan (Michael Eklund). In a handy if not quite credible plot contraption Casey is using a prepaid disposable phone making her location harder to trace and thereby drawing out the tension.The lifeline connection between Jordan and Casey is the heart of the film and director Brad Anderson working from a screenplay by Richard DOvidio choreographs gut-churning sequences as Jordan instructs the girl in ways to attract attention from the speeding sedan.These scenes also offer gruesome cautionary lessons in the etiquette of approaching suspicious weirdos on the road. The kidnapper doesnt take it well when his neat little plot is complicated by encounters with good Samaritans including one played by Michael Imperioli.But while Anderson gets the adrenaline pumping once that digital tether between Jordan and Casey is broken the story devolves into formulaic genre territory where any semblance of reasonable behavior is a distant blip in the rearview mirror.REVIEW More movie reviews from the TimesIn recent years Anderson known for well-received low-budget features such as ""Next Stop Wonderland"" and ""The Machinist"" has focused on prestigious cable dramas (""Boardwalk Empire"" ""The Killing""). Despite the impressive scale of his new film the material has the mild impact of a special episode of a network crime series with Eklunds villain a figure of mannered creepiness rather than profound chills.""The Call"" effectively taps into primal fears only to serve up a deflating bit of intended catharsis. On the way it stoops to ""a-ha"" moments of back story via conveniently arranged photos and teases out the threat of torture in the kind of bunker thats a popular choice among big-screen suburban psychopaths (""The Lovely Bones"" ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"").In the process Breslins good girl learns to curse but not before being half-undressed and subjected to her abductors sadistic leer. But the movies biggest letdown is the way its shift to action heroics makes Jordans occupation and its intriguing dramatic potential beside the point.calendarlatimes.com------------------------------------The CallMPAA ratingA R for violence disturbing content and some languageRunning timeA 1 hour 34 minutesPlayingA In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTheir blaze of gloryOctober 1 2004B.A.P.S.

Starring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin. Directed by Brad Anderson. R. 96 minutes. There are thrillers and then there are thrillers. And then theres ""The Call"" which if it were any more intense would require a complete physical and medical clearance for admission into the theater. I saw this film with a packed audience of about 300 people having 300 nervous breakdowns people jumping out of their skin or compressing into the seat in an agony of tension. At one point in the movie a woman tries to crawl through a narrow space and I found myself moving forward in my seat as though by moving I could help her out of there. Thats how complete is this movies ability to put you in the predicament of its characters. ""The Call"" might not be a classic for the ages but for a Friday night? For a movie to take people out of themselves? And to make them marvel at the viewing experience that just happened to them? This one is hard to beat. Its so simple. Its an idea that has been lying on a table forever and someone finally picked it up. Halle Berry plays Jordan a 911 dispatcher in a phone center the Los Angeles police call ""the Hive."" It is a high-stress job because every single bad thing that happens in Los Angeles is first heard about in this room - and lots and lots of bad things happen in Los Angeles. One night Jordan takes a call from a teenage girl reporting a lunatic trying to break into her home. Jordan gives the girl good advice at first; then she makes a crucial mistake. This mistake haunts her for six months so that when she finds herself talking to another girl in another crisis she is determined to do everything she can to make sure the girl survives. Aside from a brief introduction ""The Call"" takes place entirely over the course of just a few hours. Abigail Breslin plays a teenager who wakes up in the trunk of a car speeding down the freeway with a serial killer behind the wheel. She happens to have a cell phone and calls 911 - i.e. Halle Berry - but its one of those disposable cell phones that cant be traced. It seems hopeless. Its an enormous city and all the girl knows is that she is in a red car. The dispatcher has to figure out a way to help her escape but without much time and next to no options. The script finds ways to spin this out into a succession of riveting incidents that are believable enough and brutally nerve-racking. Berry and Breslin are everything the script demands of them - controlled abandoned frantic hysterical enraged. They and director Brad Anderson bring us into their world. But lets spare some love for Michael Eklund too. He plays the serial killer and hes so convincingly vile pathetic and repellent that audiences may forget hes acting. Indeed its a risk to be so good at playing someone so awful. Lets hope Eklund isnt rewarded for his efforts by having to play serial killers for the next 10 years. In any case by the time ""The Call"" is over viewers are muttering to themselves strangers are talking to each other and people are planning where theyre going to have a drink to calm down. Its one of those movies that rare thing - a thriller that actually thrills. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT March 14 2013The action starts with a bang but deteriorates and grows more absurd as the story strays farther from the LAPD call center.Halle Berry offers a convincing performance but cant escape the preposterous plot holes in The Call.(Photo Greg Gayne TriStar Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Halle Berry Abigail Breslin Morris Chestnut Michael EklundRated R; runtime 1 hour 36 minutes; opens Friday nationwideThe Call cribs from so many other psychological thrillers that it might as well be called ""The Girl With the Lovely Bones Cellular Silence of the Lambs.Halle Berry gives a convincing performance and attempts to anchor the movie ( out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide). But she cant save a story that is shot through with holes and grows more preposterous the more tense it tries to become.The Call opens effectively in ""the Hive"" an expansive L. A. Police Department 911 call center. These first responders calmly talk people through a wide range of emergencies from a bat flying into a childs room to a home invasion.Its the latter emergency that derails veteran 911 operator Jordan Turner (Berry).VIDEO Halle Berrys new hair in The CallMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYShe makes a tactical error when talking to a terrified teenager who is home alone when a man breaks into her house. Jordan is shaken by her mistake and haunted by a terse comment from the intruder. After she forcefully tells him ""You dont have to do this"" he replies chillingly ""Its already done.""Jordan is so troubled from the outcome that she takes a personal leave. When she comes back to work she trains new employees and avoids the phones. But in demonstrating proper procedure Jordan ends up taking a call from Casey (Abigail Breslin) who has been abducted from a shopping mall and thrown into the trunk of a car.Its a nightmarish scenario. And the less said about it the better to maintain maximum suspense.Jordan is determined to save Caseys life. Thinking on her feet she comes up with some effective ways to provide the police tips on Caseys whereabouts. But theyre dealing with a deranged and clever kidnapper (Michael Eklund).Breslin has ditched the glasses and grown up since 2006sLittle Miss Sunshine. As the victim here she isnt given much to do except panic cry and plead for her life. But she does convey believable fear and vulnerability. Eklund plays it way over the top and the story grows increasingly preposterous the more hes on the screen. Its Berrys movie and she plays her part nimbly until a climactic finale in which shes forced to become almost another character from another movie entirely.The Call trips up seriously when Jordan switches from competent emergency operator to avenging angel/action heroine. She can be ingenious in her efforts to keep imperiled callers focused and calm but also surprisingly dim.Though the film takes time to establish key connections between Jordan and her policeman dad and her LAPD detective boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) it inexplicably drops them.The story adheres to the thriller convention of the dilly-dallying psycho killer who takes inordinate time before doing his evil deeds allowing the good guys to come and save the victim. What begins as an intriguingly tense look at an under-appreciated group of crime-fighters devolves into an overwrought re-hash of similar stories. 12 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/WJumIE",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/03/14/the-call-review/1921625/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29,200,thecall15,thecall,usatoday

Its a grisly revelation and its played for shock value -- both for the audience and for the character making the discovery. Theres only one problem Early in the film the body of one of these girls is recovered. So the details of the killers M.O. shouldnt come as any shock whatsoever to the character that discovers his lair. Its careless storytelling -- and unfortunately its typical of the bizarre choices and the lazy sloppy structure that inform the last 20 minutes of the film. Those oddities include the moment when the films protagonist -- a 911 operator named Jordan (Halle Berry) -- undergoes a sudden personality shift. Theres also a hilariously ham-handed attempt at what I can only assume is meant to be a metaphor for American attitudes toward crime punishment and vengeance signaled by the conspicuous framing of an American flag behind Jordan in a key moment before the proceedings start going completely bonkers. Even the props department drops the ball providing canisters marked ""nitric oxide"" (rather than nitrous) to be used as anesthetic for an impromptu medical procedure. The shoddy attention to character plausibility and detail is particularly surprising coming from Anderson a director of smart indie thrillers like The Machinist Session 9 and Transsiberian. Hes been a gifted filmmaker with a talent for creating chilling tension through meticulous control of just these elements. While The Call never feels quite up to par with those earlier films for the bulk of its running time it at least seems like a passable entertainment with a handful of moments that do showcase Andersons usual flair for manufacturing an atmosphere of dread. The film opens with a nicely constructed set piece detailing the fast pace and pressure of 911 operators work transitioning into the call that will alter Jordans life a home invasion in which that serial killers latest target dials 911 while hes breaking into her house -- forcing Jordan to try helping her escape capture over the phone while waiting for the police to arrive. Six months after that harrowing call Jordan is a post-traumatic mess popping diazepam removed from the ""hive"" of the call floor and training new recruits. The training sequence is the first that doesnt work as Richard DOvidios script uses it as a blatant opportunity to present expository information on the difficulties of the job -- difficulties that have already been shown rather than summarized in the preceding sequence. i Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is the kidnap-and-kill target in The Call. Greg Gayne/TriStar hide caption toggle caption Greg Gayne/TriStar Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is the kidnap-and-kill target in The Call. Greg Gayne/TriStar While taking the recruits on a tour of the call center an operator gets a call from Casey (Abigail Breslin) a girl who has just been kidnapped from a mall parking garage and stuffed in a trunk her captor not realizing she had a second cellphone on her. When the operator freezes while trying to calm the panicking Casey Jordan takes over the call. The near-real-time cat-and-mouse that follows is the films strongest portion as police try to track down the moving target of Casey and her captor while Jordan feeds Casey instructions designed to get other cars to notice that shes trapped in the trunk. But at the point when Casey finally loses contact with the call center the film seems at a complete loss as to where to go next. A mostly taut if overly slick thriller gives way to something else entirely; its part Saw/Hostel-influenced horror part revenge-themed exploitation. Its such a jarring shift that it feels as if an entirely different crew of filmmakers invaded the production and took over with the ending for a different movie. Common sense goes out the window as the movie is left to limp to its bizarre finish without anyone to call for rescue.

The Call with Halle Berry keeps us waiting review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Call with Halle Berry keeps us waiting reviewThe Call a thriller starring Halle Berry is a barely adequate thriller pitting a 911 operator against a psycho killer.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentEntertainment ReporterThu. March 14 2013The CallStarring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin. Directed by Brad Anderson. 88 minutes. Opens March 15 at major theatres. 14AThinking about seeing The Call? You may want to put that on hold.As much as the film tries to extend itself beyond the boilerplate thriller formula -- distressed damsel twisted psycho clock ticking -- a flawed script and a less than persuasive villain undermine the effort.Article Continued BelowPredictability is the biggest hazard facing thrillers like The Call. Chances are youve seen the trailer so going in you already know where the story is going Halle Berry plays Jordan a 911 operator trying to help kidnap victim Casey (Abigail Breslin) calling from the trunk of a moving car.Since Hollywood convention dictates that Berry is too big a star you can bet our plucky heroine will eventually come face to face with the demented killer and emerge scathed but victorious.Likewise since rising star Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) plays Casey rather than an unknown starlet you know shes somehow going to make it through.So its up to screenwriter Richard DOvidio to deliver a story with enough unforeseen turns and jump-out-of-your-seat moments to keep it interesting and for director Brad Anderson to maintain a breakneck pace as Jordan struggles to save Casey from a certain and unpleasant death.Unfortunately both efforts are flawed and as the film draws to its prolonged and mostly predictable conclusion the more sanguine among us will be checking their watches and yearning for the closing credits.At least Berry delivers imbuing the role of Jordan with a nice frisson of intensity and desperation allowing us to contemplate the harrowing array of mayhem a 911 operator faces on a routine basis.When her misstep in the opening scene leads to tragedy and the story picks up six months later with a new victim (of predictably the same killer) its to Berrys credit that we become emotionally invested in her struggle for redemption. Breslin acquits herself well in a more thankless role. But Canadian actor Michael Eklunds twitchy portrayal of the killer is a disappointment sweaty and bleary when he should be steely-eyed and cold-blooded (and therefore more hate-able). So when the moment comes for that rush of bloody/sweet revenge-fuelled catharsis weve been longing for its only semi-satisfying.The main culprit is the script which despite a couple of novel turns falls back on hoary convention such as how Jordan despite an obvious lack of training manages to track down the killer herself.In the end The Call becomes just another thriller with an all too familiar ring.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Halle Berry answers The Call - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Halle Berry answers The Call Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 03.14.13 | 1237 PM If nothing else consider ""The Call"" an educational experience. What happens when you call 911? Heres Halle Berry as LAPD operator Jordan Turner explaining it all to us and a handful of onscreen recruits The airy call center known as the Hive the codes and procedures the tricks of the trade (dont make promises keep your emotional distance expect to hear from people asking directions to Starbucks). We know Jordans a battle-scarred veteran because weve seen her lose a kidnapped girl (Evie Louise Thompson) to a heavy-breathing psychopath (Michael Eklund) in the harrowing opening minutes of ""The Call."" Additional tip If you lose the connection dont call the caller back. The killer will hear the phone ring. Oops. Related Link Find showtimse and theaters This being the movies Jordan gets a second chance when the psycho strikes again snatching Los Angeles teenager Casey (Abigail Breslin going from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to Little Miss Nightmare) from a shopping mall parking lot. Casey has a cellphone but its a disposable and cant be traced -- otherwise ""The Call"" would be 15 minutes long. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Instead the movies 90 minutes of effective grueling increasingly ugly eventually ridiculous suspense. As LAs finest (including Jordans dreamboat boyfriend played by Morris Chestnut) scramble to find the maroon Camaro with Casey in its trunk ""The Call"" works as many variations on its set-up as possible. Those who cross paths with the villain -- like Michael Imperioli (""The Sopranos"") as a livery driver -- dont fare so well. But Jordan forges a bond with Casey over favorite movies (""Bridesmaids"") common astrological signs (Capricorn) and the proper etiquette of taillight removal. Youve seen pieces of this movie in ""Psycho"" ""Silence of the Lambs"" and 2004s ""Cellular."" Still the early scenes in the Hive give ""The Call"" a needed novelty Its a workplace drama and the work is responding to other peoples desperate worst-case scenarios. But its also a genre exercise which means the movie has to get dumber and dumber as it conforms to Hollywoods notions of audience expectations. It means Jordan has to go after the psycho herself has to go into that dark bunker alone has to -- well I wont spoil the ending but it leaves common sense far behind the better to cater to our bloodlust. The performances are fine. Berry sets her jaw ignores her poodle haircut and sticks to business while Breslin allows herself to be put through the wringer on her way to a deserved grown-up career. As the psycho Eklund twitches and sweats real good. But it needs to be asked What on earth is director Brad Anderson doing here? The man who made the delicate Boston romance ""Next Stop Wonderland"" (1998) the creepy Christian-Bale-gets-skeletal drama ""The Machinist"" (2004) and the baroque Euro-thriller ""Transsiberian"" (2008) has gone down-market with seamy exploitive touches like fish-eye lenses pushed repeatedly into victims sobbing faces. Maybe Anderson wants to sell out but hes not very good at it. If the early scenes in ""The Call"" pull you in with their sharply crafted suspense the last third has the dispiriting funk of a talented filmmaker throwing in the towel.

"The Call 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Call 3 stars Halle Berry in a scene from ""The Call."" Greg Gayne/Sony-TriStar Pictures SHARE URL EMAIL FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO The Call Fair 3 stars Director Brad Anderson. Starring Halle Berry Evie Thompson Abigail Breslin. Rated R for violence disturbing content and some language. By Jake Coyle Associated Press Thu Mar 14 2013 1206 PM In countless films about emergencies crimes and police work the 911 dispatcher is but a bit player an anonymous robotic voice briefly heard on the other end of a breathless call made by our movies main players. But in ""The Call"" the 911 operator gets a starring role. It would seem to be long overdue since Halle Berry is apparently among their ranks. Shes a highly professional emergency operator in Los Angeles where the trauma of a first kidnapping case has forced her to hang up the headset. But having shifted to a trainer position shes lured back for a second kidnapping call when a rookie dispatcher cant handle the frightened pleas from a teenager trapped in a cars trunk (Abigail Breslin). Director Brad Anderson (who has a few sturdy thrillers to his credit ""Transsiberian"" The Machinist"") working from the simple high-concept screenplay by Richard DOvidio ably cuts between Berrys increasingly emotionally-attached Jordan Turner and Breslins panicking Casey Welson contrasting the fraught strategizing of Turner with the frantic police pursuit of the kidnapper (Michael Eklund). Turners cop boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) is among those in the hunt. ""The Call"" dials up a shallow thrill ride but one efficiently peppered with your typical ""dont go in there"" moments. But what once was usual for Hollywood -- reliable popcorn-eating genre frights -- isnt so much anymore. ""The Call"" is a rudimentary almost old-fashioned 90-minute escape that manages to achieve its low ambitions. To distract and calm Welson Turner at one point asks her her favorite movie to which she replies ""Bridesmaids."" The bit has a two-pronged effect. One we cant help but think Wouldnt it be nice to instead be watching something as good as ""Bridesmaids""? But also two to remind us of the joy of moviegoing of which thoughtless movies like ""The Call"" are a definite part. But while ""The Call"" manages to build some suspense from the trunk of the car -- the clever attempts to elicit help the dwindling cell phone battery -- its deficiencies become less forgivable once the action turns off the road. Eklunds psychopath kidnapper is cartoonishly drawn and when he has Welson back at this lair -- and Turner is summoned from the high-tech oddly NASA-like call center -- ""The Call"" disconnects with horror film cliches. Berry with a ball of short curly hair keeps the film rolling even when it veers off course. Breslin making a leap to more sordid territory has little to do but be scared. Michael Imperioli makes a brief appearance as a concerned bystander a reminder mainly that the fine ""Sopranos"" actor deserves considerably better. From ""Phone Booth"" to ""Cellular"" (a film with which ""The Call"" shares many similarities) phone-based movies have generally been bad service for moviegoers who so often would rather look at their own mobiles in the movie theater. Perhaps we can await a sequel to ""The Call"" that shifts to the 311 call center where a pothole complaint spirals dramatically out of control.

They hired Brad Anderson (""Session 9"" ""The Machinist"") to direct and loaded the cast with sharp performers from Halle Berry as the operator and Abigail Breslin as the girl in peril to plum supporting roles for Morris Chestnut Roma Maffia and HBO alums Michael Imperioli and Justina Machado. And for most of the running time they get away with it -- until the script by Richard DOvidio (""Exit Wounds"") puts down the phone plunging its heroine into a standard serial-killer thriller and as a bonus making her act like an idiot. When ""The Call"" channels Cocteaus ""The Human Voice"" and focuses on Berry and her headset the movie maintains an entertaining level of suspense; when it becomes yet another ""Silence of the Lambs"" rip-off you can feel the tension seep away. Experienced 911 staffer Jordan (Berry) stands out among the worker bees at ""the hive"" the central complex for all of L.A.s emergency services. But when shes distracted after a romantic coffee-break visit by her cop boyfriend Paul (Chestnut) she makes a fatal error calling back the young victim of a home invasion. The phones ring gives away the girls hiding place and Jordan hears the killer dispatch his victim. Fast-forward to six months later Jordan is on anxiety meds and has given up the switchboard to become an instructor. When one of her trainees is unable to deal with a panicked call from Casey (Breslin) who has just been snatched from a local mall Jordan must return to duty. Anderson masterfully weaves between Jordan and Caseys ever-more-panicked conversation and the widespread manhunt for the girl; adding to the anxiety is actor Michael Eklund who plays the kidnapper as twitchy enough to be capable of very bad things yet smart enough to possibly get away with it. When ""The Call"" works its a supremely effective B-thriller. If only the film trusted its strengths. Somewhere along the line it was decided that it wasnt enough for Jordan to be a really great 911 operator. Apparently she also had to be a recklessly foolhardy vigilante pursuing her own clues and stumbling into the bad guys murder den unarmed and without backup. It feels like a real betrayal to Berry whos actually investing some soul into this character. (No easy feat as shes been saddled with a wig that calls to mind both Ronald McDonald and Patti LaBelle circa 1975.) All we know about Jordan is how she does her job but thats all we need to know and for this competent woman to turn into another blithering slasher heroine feels like a massive failure of nerve. ""The Call"" turns out to be more interesting than what the trailers promised yes but by getting hung up in an unconvincing and ill-conceived third act were left with a disappointing disconnect.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its rarely a problem when the heroes of action movies are called into action but it proves ruinous for The Call a tense and efficient little thriller right up to the moment when Halle Berry a 911 operator decides to leave her desk. A seasoned veteran of ""The Hive"" a sophisticated control center that links the citys 911 operators with first responders Berry is admired for her quick thinking and calm disposition in puzzling through life-or-death situations on the other end of the line. One night she makes a mistake that leads to the abduction and murder of a teenage girl and it shakes her confidence deeply--while also setting the table for a boilerplate redemption story. Berry gets her opportunity when she fields another abduction call this one coming from a teenager (Abigail Breslin) who was kidnapped in a mall parking deck and thrown in the truck of a car. With Breslins disposable cell phone making her near-impossible to trace the mostly solid second act has Berry settling the girls frazzled nerves and offering innovative solutions to alert the authorities to her location. The fact that Berry cannot directly help the victim is key to the suspense Both women have to operate within confined spaces and limited means and theres tension in their mutual blind spots. Director Brad Anderson a former indie upstart (his Next Stop Wonderland was a famous Sundance overbuy) turned capable genre filmmaker (his moody horror film Session 9 is particularly strong) emphasizes the violence with a distracting stutter effect but otherwise handles the back-and-forth between Berry and Breslin with swiftness and brio. But once Berry leaves ""The Hive"" and tries to hunt Breslin down on her own The Call sinks from a solid meat-and-potatoes redemption thriller to a lurid gratuitous relentlessly silly revenge story. Suddenly a premise that began as a simple abduction morphs into a nasty exploitation movie with an unstoppable monster for a villain a creepily sexualized child-in-peril and a lust for payback that goes completely unquestioned. But all that unsavory business aside the biggest problem with the third act is how the film discards the novelty of its own premise in order to bring its star into the action. When Berry trades her headset for a rock its the bluntest metaphor imaginable for a film thats completely lost its mind.

"Film Review The Call | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Call Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 7 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 11 2013 | 0600PM PT Halle Berry stars in this awfully familiar high-concept thriller Representing a slightly skewed take on 2004s ""Cellular"" crossed with a lobotomized ""Silence of the Lambs"" Brad Andersons high-concept thriller ""The Call"" would be an unremarkable bit of women-in-peril dreck were it not for two distinguishing factors -- the sexualized sadism inflicted upon the half-dressed 16-year-old Abigail Breslin and the equally sadistic Sideshow Bob coiffure affixed to the otherwise lovely Halle Berry. These indignities aside theres little to differentiate this high-pitched screamer from a particularly feverish ""Law and Order"" rerun and it might be tough for such a film to dial in sizable auds to theaters. One of the more high-profile films to bear the WWE Studios label in recent years ""The Call"" features no actual grappling yet it shows the fingerprints of its benefactor in the presence of wrestling star David Otunga as well as a serial-killer villain (Michael Eklund) who seems less psychopath than juice-head. Perhaps its unfair to blame the producers for the films overwrought tempo but whatever the cause the pics dunderheaded emotional timbre is miles removed from the relative class of director Andersons previous efforts ""The Machinist"" and ""Transsiberian"" confusing macho aggression for menace and tightly framed screaming for suspense. Berry stars as Jordan a hotshot 911 operator who rules over the bustling call center known as ""the Hive"" -- we know shes a star when co-workers casually ask her for the institutional code for a multiple stabbing. Featuring some nice aerial photography of Downtown Los Angeles the pic expends 10 minutes laying character foundations involving Jordans unseen cop father her handsome LAPD-officer boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) and her charged relationship with an unsympathetic supervisor then disregards these details entirely once the action gets rolling. Receiving a 911 call from a teenage girl in the midst of a home invasion Jordan concocts an elaborate strategy to help her evade the predator but gives the girl away by hitting the redial button when the call is cut off. (Berrys character will similarly vacillate between Jason Bourne-like ingenuity and howling stupidity throughout the remainder of the film.) The girl is abducted and murdered by the unseen catchphrase-spouting killer and the guilt-ridden Jordan takes a leave of absence. Try as she might Jordan cant avoid the call to heroism which arrives soon via another emergency call. Teenage Casey (Breslin) has been drugged and kidnapped from a mall parking lot and wakes up in the trunk of a car speeding down the freeway. Through some needlessly convoluted plot machinations she has a friends untraceable pay-as-you-go cell phone in her pocket and Jordan must don the headset once again to talk her out of harms way. Its here that the film generates its only real sparks of invention as the desk-bound Jordan is forced to coach the hysterical teen though a series of ruses to try to tip off passers-by. Unspooling more or less in real-time the pursuit sequences manage to evoke the primary appeal of such high-concept material for which one happily suspends disbelief just to see how long the filmmakers can stick to the premise. But no sooner can you say ""this time ... its personal"" than the film disengages completely running Jordan through some paint-by-numbers Nancy Drew routines and veering toward the ickily exploitative as it invents reasons to remove Breslins shirt and tie her up. Berry is enough of a pro to muddle through yet another underwhelming star vehicle with her dignity intact and Breslin acquits herself well enough for a problematic role in which shes forced to cry and scream nearly continuously. Eklund is a hulking malevolent presence though his scrambled-brow attempt at a psychopathic glare provoked gales of laughter at the screening attended. Whether its the odd directorial tic of freeze-framing during moments of violence -- perhaps intended to suggest a sort of rage-induced blackout but which feels like a projector glitch -- or the offputting cadence shifts in editing the film hits a number of unusual technical notes yet the overall quality is solid. Practical effects and freeway footage are well handled as are the scenes contained entirely within the trunk of a car. The Call Reviewed at Arclight Cinemas Hollywood March 5 2013. MPAA rating R.

Reply kathy says March 22 2013 at 621 pm I thought the ending was unreal and not believable. No person could survive the attack and live and once again you see the person still living. The ending should have involved police surrounding the place and the girls parents reuniting with her. Reply Joseph L Cooke says March 18 2013 at 514 pm Good movie and it had no competition. Excellent craftsmanship throughout. Reply daniel says March 13 2013 at 222 pm This movie will be another failure... Wont gross over 20 million Reply kristen says March 11 2013 at 910 pm i saw a screening last week at USC and the movie rocked. i am always confused when reviewers watch the same film and they hate genre movies. i figure they either tried to make it in hollywood and failed or they are just angry at the world...all of my friends thought it was intense and a great ride sort of like silence of the lambs. Reply eastlake256 says March 13 2013 at 642 am You are 100% right. You cant trust most of these reviewers. They tend to be doing jobs that they really dont want to do. Writers who havent sealed that book deal yet directors that are out of work actors that never made it very far. Who the hell remembers what was going on in 2004 let alone some movie called ""cellular"" Its like they just want to hear themselves talking? Anyhow... this movie was AWESOME I honestly thought it was going to be terrible. but it was scary as hell.. Good job to the folks involved. Reply Shadana says March 27 2013 at 1147 am I agree I was skeptical when I herd about it but it ended up being a GREAT movie. It had everything. Drama that ""whats gonna happen next"" feeling and so much more. I didnt want it to end. Now the ending is still a bit questioning but at the same time gives your mind that curiosity far as what happened to the guy and the victims.. But all in all I liked the movie and it just goes to show that we as people REALLY do take life for granted and we shouldnt because there are even more people out there like that little girl whos situations are much worse than our own petty issues.

TWITTER Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin star in a tense extreme-jeopardy thriller that kicks off with a breathless 911 call. Although it falls into a couple of jaw-dropping females-in-peril stupid moments near the end -- that is when unarmed women enter creepy cabins or dark basements knowing full well a boogeyman is on the loose -- The Call for the most part is a tense extreme-jeopardy thriller that delivers the intended goods. If a successful date movie sometimes is measured by its ability to scare girls so much that theyll impulsively grab the arm of their male companions then this efficiently made TriStar film should do quite nicely for a couple of weekends anyway. This has all the earmarks of a straight commercial assignment for indie stalwart Brad Anderson who of late has distinguished himself more for his work on high-end cable dramas such as The Wire Treme and Boardwalk Empire than for his features. The give-me-a-break moments notwithstanding the film does exactly what it sets out to do -- create genuine suspense about a teenagers fate in the hands of a predatory whack job -- and does so within a fresh conceptual framework. VIDEO The Call Trailer The central character in Richard DOvidios screenplay is a good and unusual one. Jordan (Halle Berry) works the phones at the Los Angeles Police Departments 911 emergency call center -- a large high-tech beehive at which dozens of operators receive ceaseless urgent phone calls from people throughout the city with problems ranging from a bird having entered the house to a murder seeming to be in the offing. The latter is the case during the breathless prologue in which a young woman desperately informs Jordan that a prowler is assaulting her. Cool and methodical as she has been trained to be Jordan suddenly hears the creep come on the line and tells him ""You dont have to do this."" She is to remain haunted by his reply ""Its already done."" Undone by her failure to stop this crime Jordan goes off the phones and switches to briefing applicants for the type of job she formerly had. Her two rules to live by are ""Stay emotionally controlled"" and ""Dont make promises."" However when it appears that the same madman is at it again shes drawn back in to try to advise another teenage blonde Casey (Abigail Breslin) what to do now that shes a captive with a cellphone in the trunk of a moving car. Theres no mystery about who the bad guy is; Michael (Michael Eklund) is a sweaty raving lunatic who after trapping Casey in a mall parking garage is bent on taking her to a place where he intends to do something very very bad. While the police desperately try to trace the phone call before the battery runs out and Michael drives out of downtown to points north Jordan guides the captive through some successful ploys such as knocking out a brake light from the inside and pouring some handy paint out the back to draw attention which ultimately forces the maniac to pull over and deal with an observant limo driver (Michael Imperioli) whos too curious and solicitous for his own good. The constant back-and-forth between the 911 center Caseys severely restricted perspective and the highway pursuit by squad cars and helicopters gives Anderson plenty of opportunity to create suspense both through the successes and failures of the prisoners strenuous efforts and the calibrated cross-cutting occasioned by the ongoing chase. Some of the best moments come when the driver must stop and confront others while Casey struggles to make her presence known. But the film loses some traction -- and provokes a chortle or two -- when they leave the road and finally arrive at the destination said isolated house and cellar where serial killers do what serial killers do from before Psycho to after The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. As always its a question of how long the nutcase dawdles in preparation for the big event and whether the savior can get there in time to stop it. The film has been smarter than this up to now and disappointingly descends from the intriguing world of the emergency operator to the cliched realm of the twisted villain. Up to the denouement Berry delivers a focused emotionally honest turn as a woman whose profession is far more taxing and draining than the norm; Jordan shouldnt need to become an action heroine. The virtually unrecognizable Breslin must spend most of the running time crying and pleading while cooped up in the trunk no doubt a taxing assignment while Eklund delivers the creep factor in spades. Morris Chestnut plays Jordans supportive cop boyfriend and asking Imperioli to play a well-intentioned good guy creates some interesting colorings for a brief role. Downtown L.A. and San Fernando Valley locations are well used and production values are solid on a budget.
