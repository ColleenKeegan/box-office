By Richard Corliss Feb. 25 2012 Share Read Later Relativity Media Act of Valor Year 2012 Director Mike McCoy Scott Waugh Studio Relativity Media Actors Alex Veadov Roselyn Sanchez Nestor Serrano RelatedAct of Valor Just how realistic is this Navy SEAL movie? Entertainment WeeklyBox Office Report Act of Valor Tops Friday With 9.1 Mil The Hollywood Reporter Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Last May when President Obama announced that members of Navy SEAL Team Six had found and killed Osama bin Laden in northeastern Pakistan questions quickly arose. Why was the ailing 54-year-old al Qaeda leader not taken alive -- subdued detached from his dialysis machine and remanded to custody? And if urgent exigencies demanded his assassination why was bin Laden shot in the head rendering photographic proof of his death officially unpublishable? Instead of aiming for the heart when they confronted the bad guy in Abbottabad had some SEAL members gone suddenly vengeful aimed higher and kept on shooting because the bastard deserved it? Having seen Act of Valor the vigorous amateurish action movie in which active-combat SEALs play something like themselves on dangerous missions around the world I can deduce one answer to those troubling questions. SEALs have cool heads and faultless aim. If they monogrammed the skull of the 9/11 CEO it must be because their President had ordered them to bring him the head of Osama bin Laden. (MORE See all of TIMEs 2012 Oscar coverage here) Initiated not in a Hollywood studio but in a Pentagon PR office and starring a half-dozen SEALs identified only by their first name and rank -- Lieutenant Commander Rorke Special Warfare Operative Chief Dave SPO First Class Ajay and others called Weimy Sonny and Mikey -- Act of Valor offers further insights into these nonfiction action figures. They are proud warriors fierce friends devoted husbands and pretty stiff actors. The movie which claims to be ""based on real acts of valor"" begins with on-camera testimony by Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh the ex-stuntmen who directed the picture; part hype about the films authenticity part implicit apology for the rawness of the picture the statement is like a ""making-of"" DVD extra youre supposed to watch before the movie. What follows is a story of this SEAL team saving America from an international cast of scoundrels. The Philippine suicide squad and the Mexican cartel thugs have been commandeered by two guys from Chechnya a drug smuggler nicknamed Cristo (Alex Veadov) and his boyhood friend now a jihadist who calls himself Muhammad Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle). Shabal plans to sneak the Filipinos through a tunnel from Mexico into the U.S. with the ultimate plan of bombing Las Vegas. Virtually all ethnic and religious stereotypes are represented including one that hasnt been seen much in movies lately the avaricious hook-nosed Jew. Thats Cristo whose merger with Shadad may be meant to show that Muslims and Jews can work together. Alert Iran. The villains here are as interested in torturing women and killing schoolchildren as they are in making dirty billions or bringing down the Great Beast Satan (US). They also cant shoot straight whereas the SEALs aim is unerring; no collateral damage when they blast away. And as hand-to-hand combat heroes they dont fire missiles at Afghan villages from computers back home. The Dronesmen playing deadly video games may be the warriors of the future. The SEALs with their ethnically diverse membership and platitudes about the folks back home are like the coolest commando hotshots from a World War II movie. From that war emerged a whole generation of actors not all of whom had come from Broadway. Audie Murphy a Texas farm boy who was the wars most decorated GI forged a star career in Westerns and in his own bio-pic To Hell and Back. But Murphy didnt have the impact of another soldiers single film appearance. Harold Russell had lost both of his hands when an explosive device detonated (not in combat; he was making an Army training film). Playing the sailor Homer Parrish in the 1946 hit The Best Years of Our Lives Russell gave audiences a poignant glimpse of the wars true cost. It could be that Murphy and Russell registered as fine actors because they had good scripts and better directors; Russell who won both the Supporting Actor Oscar and an honorary Academy Award ""for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans"" was directed in Best Years by three-time Oscar winner William Wyler. Rorke and Dave the central performers in Act of Valor had no such luck. The screenplay credited to 300 co-scripter Kurt Johnstad (though he is barely mentioned in the press notes about the project) is heavy on military jargon downrange -- ""We got about 4.7 clicks at 3-5-5"" -- and back home dewy bonding with Team members and fretful families. One SEAL has five kids another is expecting his first child. One carries his grandfathers American flag in his uniform pocket. On and on cliches pretending to be insights. McCoy and Waugh known as the Bandito Brothers can assemble complex battle scenes including an early skirmish that demonstrates all three of the Teams skills parachuting to the ground maneuvering silently under swamp water and creeping unseen toward an enemy compound. (SEAL is an acronym for Sea Air and Land.) The Banditos stumble though when they try getting the real soldiers to speak with passion or coherence. Fighting is a learned skill; so is acting. And the SEAL stars are plausible only when on maneuvers -- performing as their own stunt doubles. The SEALs who Johnstad says appeared in the film only on vacation time certainly look the rugged handsome part; but we cant tell if they could really act since the characters theyre meant to play are only heroic cardboard cutouts. And heroes dont question the mission. As they swoop into a globe-ful of foreign countries to pick off insurgents no one says ""Hey were the invaders. They live here."" Of course the movie is propaganda for the Department of Defense which has provided weaponry to Hollywood movies from Top Gun to Michael Bays Transformers series. (On the DVD for the first Transformers Pentagon liaison officer Paul Sifor recalled Bay touring a ""tank graveyard...like a kid at Christmas. Can I have that? Can I have that? Can I burn that? Can I blow that up? Absolutely. Anything you want."") An end credit for Act of Valor announces that it was produced ""in association with Tom Clancy"" the novelist who charges that the Clinton Administration was partly responsible for the 9/11 attacks because of its ""gutting"" of the CIA. The Pentagon clearly hopes Act of Valor will be an enticement for potential SEALs. Join the team and save the world and maybe be a movie star But recruiting posters dont often feature -- as this film does -- a soldier who loses an eye to an enemy bullet or who dies smothering a live grenade or who is killed just before his wife delivers her first baby. By our count three of the core SEALs are maimed or dead by the end. A new baby is left without her loving father. The picture ends not with a parade but with a funeral. And that may be the toughest most lasting image in this cockamamie Pentagon-approved war adventure.

And rightfully so. Theyre absolute badasses. But attacking with ninja stealth jumping out of airplanes and tracking down terrorists doesnt leave much time for acting lessons. With a cast comprised of real-deal SEALs (who not surprisingly remain nameless) Act of Valor is so rah-rah it makes Top Gun look like Easy Rider. The plot is video-game simple an Islamic jihadist from Chechnya is out to attack America on its own soil smuggling a bunch of suicide bombers across the U.S./Mexico border. Its up to the SEALs to stop them. When the bullets are flying Act of Valor is undeniably tense and thrilling. The brutal chaos of battle is well choreographed by directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh. But during this combat flick/recruitment videos quieter moments its stiff and sappy. Consider this mission only half-accomplished.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Nothing wrong with a tribute to real-life Navy SEALs the heroes who took down Osama bin Laden. But Act of Valor is an awkward something else. Filmmakers Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh have enlisted real SEALs to play themselves in a movie thats impure Hollywood fiction. The action involving Chechen rebels Mexican drug cartels and assorted terrortists is staged. And its hardly the fault of these commandos that their acting deserves no salute. In truth theyre a lot better than Charlie Sheen was in the 1990 crapfest that was Navy SEALs. I dont know what to make of Act of Valor. Its like reviewing a recruiting poster.

Just watched it and I have to say Im so glad I didnt pay money for it. Im as patriotic as many of you but this is a crappy movie. It is painfully obvious these guys are talented operators but awful actors. You can think a movie is awful and maintain your respect for those who risk their lives to honor their country. Stop attacking the reviewer and be more disappointed in the director who shouldve known better Papa2said on Tuesday March 06 2012 114615 PMMr. Roeper thank you for being fair and honest when it came to reviewing act of valor (it must have been a hard one to review) unlike all these people my cousin name was on that line of credits and have seen first hand how these guys operate. That being said the plot was bad there is no question about that but was it the the SEALs fault? No of course not they where given a subpar script because of subpar directors so I will not fault the SEALs. It would have been better if they had a been given better direction and a plot that was not pulled out of a video game plot. You can have your cake and eat it. I will not stand for subpar movies either. If everyone would really sit down and stop looking at the movie in a non bias way they would see that SEALs did great at what they do best and the directors failed at what they should have been good at. RICHsaid on Tuesday March 06 2012 70626 PMGOOD REVIEW BUT I THOUGHT THEY ACTED WELL Ssaid on Friday March 02 2012 73353 PMIt is understandable to hear the characters are lacking in development and folks arent connecting with them; it follows from too much realism (although not at the pace of the movie). We now live in an age where Hollywood defines reality rather than vice-versa... Chrissaid on Wednesday February 29 2012 14945 PMI have to agree with the review purely based on my own thoughts of the film. I read the book Act of Valor about 2 weeks ago not even knowing about the movie. I guess I should have known better but I hoped the movie would bring the developed characters and fascinating details of the SEALS and covert ops from the book. As I left the theater it was then I noticed the recruitment literature. This review was fair and I detect no disrespect on his part. People would be more entertained and better informed by reading the book it costs the same as a ticket. Being former military myself I can just picture those SEALS/actors getting ribbed by their fellow frogmen for hammy acting. Honorable men nonetheless. Georgesaid on Monday February 27 2012 32138 PMI honestly liked the movie but understand your rating due to the somewhat stilted acting and plot. I also have to say that seeing the authenticity of the service members the equipment and the procedures is a great change of pace. I hate when an otherwise great movie falters when they use incorrect uniforms lingo etc. Hopefully other movies will made in the same vein as Act Of Valor but with more refined stories and better acting. Reply from Richard Roeper George Thanks for your feedback. Much appreciated. One of the things I admired about ""Act of Valor"" was its attempt to be as authentic as possible. Obviously it helps when the stars of your movie are also the ultimate authorities If the script had been a little more sophisticated and a few of the SEALs had been played by professional actors I believe the film would have packed more of a dramatic punch. Ive learned over the years that whether a movie is about heroes such as the SEALs or civilians working in every profession imaginable the people who actually perform that job for a living will be able to pinpoint many inaccuracies. Im constantly getting emails from teachers cops lawyers doctors football players etc. saying ""It would never happen like that."" Theres no way a two-hour fictional movie can perfectly capture anybodys chosen field. Even documentaries are often criticized for taking shortcuts or showing only one point of view or neglecting to show certain details. Best Richard P.S. Im looking into the other thing you mentioned in your email regarding the introduction to the film and the soundtrack. Natesaid on Monday February 27 2012 13445 PMI thought the movie was amazing. The acting was rough but when the SEALs were getting down to business and giving briefings communicating on operational issues and communication while operating I think the acting was great. That being said it was also like the training environment for them so you saw the real person. When there were scenes of dialog about family etc you could tell it wasnt real to them. The film was amazing to me because the action and the technical aspects were so authentic from the gentle squeeze of the shoulder before they enter and clear a room to the way they move communicate use thier equipment. It was phenomenal and as a two time combat vet with the Army it evoked the physical and emotional responses no other war move has ever done. The end was poignant and somber. This movie will haunt me for a while. Nate Jake Stonesaid on Monday February 27 2012 101451 AMI am going to see the film this week. Would you agree in saying there may not be a perfect military film the pleases the viewers the academy and the military al at once. For example Battle LA had flaws wich made critics hate it but the marines loved how the movie acuratly portrayed marines. As opposed to The Hurt locker wich critics and the academy loved the drama and suspense but the military and EOD teams everywhere shouted out how inacurate thier procedures and techniques were shown. Can there be a military film that gets everything right? Please respond. Terry Pecksaid on Monday February 27 2012 24718 AMWhile I dont disagree with your review I have to emphasis that I think that the point IS to show these anonymous warriors in this fashion. As a combat veteran of Iraq and the youngest of several generations of U. S. Combat veterans I firmly feel this film is the most realistic and accurate portrayal of American servicemen their actions and their behaviors. It is everything that the Hurt Locker wasnt and I am thankful for it. On a side note I enjoyed the veiled insults these warriors included in their dialog. While critics mock the ""cliched"" dialog its obvious they missed the sarcastic point. The dialog is real and is delivered in a manner lost on the critic to be enjoyed by fellow combat veterans. Plus the combat scenes are damn near real. Damn near a documentary. Reply from Richard Roeper All due and great respect to our Navy SEALs and other great American heroes who fight for our freedoms I cannot and will not review a movie based on the subject matter and not the quality of the film itself. That would be insulting to the viewers and even to the subject of the film. I stand by my review and EVERYTHING I said in it--including my praise for the SEALs. All the best RichardCarlossaid on Sunday February 26 2012 94947 PMGuess we the public dont have your refined taste. Most of us licked act of valor which you trashed and hatted valley of Elijah which you loved. Generally if the critics love it I skip it and its served me well.

As an actual movie however it barely coheres. Mike McCoy and Scott Waughs film about a crack team of Navy SEALs uncovering and undoing an international drug-and-terror network before an attack on U.S. soil offers us a compelling first It stars real-life Navy SEALs often using live ammunition. These soldiers are so real weve been told that the film cant even list them in the credits. (Instead the end credits features a roll call of SEALs whove been killed in the line of duty with a somewhat unintentionally ominous shout-out to all those who will.) So what does a movie starring real-life Navy SEALs doing (sort of) real-life Navy SEAL things look like? Well not that much different from some video games it turns out but theres definitely a charge that comes from watching the real pros do their thing. They have a certain no-nonsense confidence thats bracing to those of us so used to the pretend toughness of recognizable Hollywood faces. Theyre assertive with their jargon and the film is full of language it bravely refuses to define I still have no idea what ""sterile aircraft"" or ""containment element"" means. The cleanly shot and edited battle scenes are impressively rousing not the least because they tend to avoid movie-friendly acts of individual heroism and instead give us scenes of genuine teamwork. (In the movies best moment an American sniper takes out a bad guy by a pier while a pair of hands reaches out of the water to grab the body so it doesnt make a splash and alert the other baddies.) At the same time with all this potential for realism its a shame that McCoy and Waugh have gone down such a jingoistic black-and-white path. The narrative here is painfully broad strokes and the villains -- a Benetton ad of evil that includes disgruntled Chechens jaded Russian Jews scared-stiff Filipinas anonymous African mercenaries and Mexican drug runners -- are a decidedly over-the-top bunch. The contrasts are hilariously stark -- the evildoers hang out in pricey foreign lofts listening to Brahms and drinking wine while our guys hang out at the beach and enjoy a few brewskis. They have yachts full of faceless babes in bikinis mixing cocktails while we have pregnant wives at home waiting by the phone. Its not that we need the villains to be nuanced or understood; its just that making them so cartoonish cheapens the real-life heroism the film is trying to celebrate. To be fair though its not like our heroes get much shading either. Any non-combat moments the soldiers in Act of Valor share when they settle down such as some moments at home with the families are thoroughly generic and stiff not unlike those staged ""narrative"" scenes in educational IMAX movies (or if youre in a less generous mood porn). They take us out of the film and have the ironic effect of dehumanizing the characters. One wonders how the movie might have played as pure unceasing battle scenes allowing the combat to define the characters; with real soldiers doing the onscreen fighting something special may well have emerged.

Relativity Media/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz Monitor Movie Guide Much has been made of the fact that the new war movie ""Act of Valor"" features real-life active-duty US Navy SEALs. As it turns out except for the curiosity factor there is no difference in the end between using SEALs playing SEALs and Hollywood actors playing SEALs. All things being equal I suppose Id rather see the real deal than say Charlie Sheen or Bruce Willis. But things are rarely equal in movieland and besides the SEALs here have been encouraged by their directors Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh to be as blandly stalwart as any garden-variety Hollywood counterpart.The movie is essentially a series of reasonably good action sequences involving wipeouts with Filipino jihadists Chechen rebels and Mexican drug cartels interspersed with buddy-buddy badinage not of the first freshness. The bad guys who specialize in funny beards funny accents and shaved heads would feel right at home in an ""Austin Powers"" movie.

The commanders allowed a small independent film company into their elite ranks to turn live training exercises into a feature-length movie five years ago in hopes of drumming up recruits fast. Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Real Navy SEALs playing themselves chase a terrorist across the globe. BOTTOM LINE Real-life action and painfully bad acting make this Navy-approved project a mixed bag. CAST Roselyn Sanchez Jason Cottle and real-life Navy SEALs LENGTH 141 Whenever a movie cooperates closely with the military someone is bound to attack it as a covert recruitment video. That was a valid criticism of ""Top Gun"" and ""Red Dawn"" but it wont work against ""Act of Valor"" a project initiated by the Navy and filmed during training exercises with active-duty SEALs playing themselves. Nothing covert there. So now that all cards are on the table hows the movie? Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break At its best ""Act of Valor"" feels like being embedded with the elite SEALs (the name stands for Sea Air and Land teams) Americas new glamour-boys following a hostage rescue in Somalia and more famously the swift dispatch of Osama bin Laden. That event soon to be a major motion picture from director Kathryn Bigelow (""The Hurt Locker"") is here reworked as a raid in a Mexican border slum one of several sequences that bristle with tension urgency and very real-looking chaos. Less convincing are the SEALs themselves who seem alive in the heat of mock-battle (the ammunition on screen is live) but cant pull off anything like emotion or even casual chitchat. If any star is born here its the twinkly-eyed SEAL called Senior Chief whose friendly-to-furious interrogation of a Russian smuggler (played by an actor Alex Veadov) is one of the films liveliest and funniest scenes. That stock Russian is one of many attempts by writer Kurt Johnstad (""300"") to turn the raw footage of directors Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh into something recognizably Hollywood. The result is an almost endearingly corny plot involving a CIA operative (Roselyn Sanchez) a Chechen terrorist (Jason Cottle) and a Mexican drug cartel. The actors are almost as bad as the SEALs and its sometimes embarrassingly easy to tell the staged action from the real thing. As a piece of filmed entertainment ""Act of Valor"" will never be mistaken for ""Top Gun"" but its a heck of a recruitment video.

"Act of Valor SEALing the deal |       NJ.com comments Act of Valor SEALing the deal Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 24 2012 at 704 AM View/Post Comments Real Navy SEALs share screen time with professional actors in ""Act of Valor."" Act of Valor"" is a movie about (sort-of) real Navy SEAL adventures starring real Navy SEALs as themselves. They arent however named in the credits for reasons of personal safety. Which seems a little illogical. If giving away their identities is a problem should they even be showing their faces onscreen? Why not just have them played by actors? But then Americans are proud of the force that took down Osama bin Laden and Hollywood would love to profit by that pride. (And if they can make even more profit by hiring a real Navy SEAL instead of paying Bruce Willis to play one -- well roger that.) So after a short but fulsome speech by the two directors the film starts off on its very complicated fictional story which ties together Ukrainian drug smugglers Chechen rebels Mexican drug cartels and terrorist assaults on America. And on the track of all of it is a team of eight veteran SEALs a band of brothers determined to fight for their country and if necessary die for each other. Early notices slammed the SEALs acting and its true that theyre a lot better at delivering an assault than delivering lines. But theyre not much worse than the so-called professionals around them. Roselyn Sanchez is passable as a captured CIA agent. But the rest of the cast is particularly bad particularly that Ukrainian villain whose accent is even more elusive than he is. Then theres the script credited to Kurt Johnstad who appears to think servicemen say things such as ""Its big trouble in little China gentleman."" Its better when Johnstad doesnt try at all and just has his heroes bark things like ""Send in a Marine detail to help exploit the target"" Or ""Secondary extract is burnt moving to tertiary extract"" Actually the movie is at its best when nobody talks and people just move. Its two directors are former stuntmen and with the actors really knowing how to hold a rifle or sweep a house for hostiles there are plenty of great action sequences. The first happens early when the team has to try to extract that kidnapped CIA agent -- and they come in by sea air and land. But theres another good scene at a Mexican shantytown and a final and sometimes surprising battle at a drug smugglers compound. By that final shootout the directors imagination starts to flag. Weve already seen too many identical shots of gunmen being taken out by a snipers headshots too many bullets crashing one-two-three into windshields before the car spins out of control. These combatants may be in the zone but as an audience were in danger of zoning out. But the film soon wraps things up. And if the ending seems a little rushed and vague too -- well ""Act of Valor"" is still miles ahead of Hollywoods first stab at the subject ""Navy Seals"" which not only got the capitalization wrong but cast Charlie Sheen. These guys though are the real deal. And any hero worship given them -- badly done or not -- is still deserved. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. Act of Valor (R) Relativity (101 min.) Directed by Mike McCoy Scott Waugh. With Roselyn Sanchez. Now playing in New Jersey.

A mechanically efficient yet soulless dramatization of the U.S. Navy SEALs in action ""Act of Valor"" ultimately misses its target The hearts and minds of American audiences. Coming on the heels of perhaps the SEALs most memorable mission -- the raid of Osama bin Ladens compound and his assassination -- this filmic celebration of the SEALs derring-do in a marathon effort spanning two continents and four targets nevertheless feels as overdone as it is technically precise. Ramrod action will secure muscular opening weekend B.O. but Heartland auds and genre buffs may be the only ones tempted to stay the course. Kurt Johnstads script derives from several actual SEALs operations but rather than serving up the action more authentically as separate ops the pic ties them together with a global terror plot that pushes this would-be docudrama closer to the territory occupied by TVs ""24."" Whats gained in conventional narrative build-up is lost in authenticity in a film that was conceived as a chance to depict real SEALs in their element. Bookended by a letter written and narrated by one of the SEALs (Dave going only by his first name as everyone in the unit does) the pic begins Stateside at the San Diego home base of the stalwart unit led by Lt. Rorke with Dave as his second-in-command leading a team comprised of Sonny Weimy Ray Ajay Mikey and ace interrogator Van O -- all played by non-pros who bring real service experience but limited acting ability to their roles. Enjoying a day of surfing and a night on the beach with their families the guys are super-relaxed for men about to go on a tough mission with Dave stiffly joking about Rorke and his wife (Ailsa Marshall) expecting a baby. Coinciding with a terror attack on an American school and the U.S. ambassador in the Philippines CIA agent Morales (Rosalyn Sanchez) is abducted in Costa Rica during her pursuit of international smuggling kingpin Christo (Alex Veadov). Rorkes unit is given their marching orders and after an exhilarating parachute jump into the jungle ""extraction"" is the name of the game. Though the sequence contains momentary thrills its also shot much like a vidgame which tends to sap deeper emotional involvement. The successful mission delivers some bad news Morales cell phone has data linking Christo with Chechen terrorist Abu Shabal (Jason Cottle) suggesting an imminent Stateside terror attack. Veadovs and Cottles over-the-top characterizations trigger flashbacks to scenarios hatched by the multinational cadres of baddies favored by ""24"" only with Kiefer Sutherlands galvanizing Jack Bauer missing from the picture. The SEALs now must spread out with a pair headed on an amphibious trek to Somalia to spy on Shabals planes loaded mysteriously with Filipino men and women while Van O with touches of dark wit and menace interrogates a slimy Christo as the baddie tries to flee to a safe haven in the South Pacific. As seemingly theatrical as the scene is -- even echoing hints of chatty Tarantino-style confrontations -- its also probably the closest to docu realism; Van O is the only SEAL in the cast who puts over the feeling that this is actually how he goes about his business. The film finally narrows to a pursuit of Shabal in Mexico where hes intending to send his Filipino allies armed with exceptionally potent suicide bombs through cross-border tunnels used by Mexican drug cartels. Initial fears that the script will devolve into a political attack on Mexico are averted with the custom caveat that this is a jointly approved U.S.-Mexico operation). The ensuing sequence is skillfully shot slam-bang stuff with sufficiently cool explosions -- and one friendly casualty -- that brings the pic full circle. While the idea to have the SEALs play themselves is a bold one it is undone by the fact that all but Van O dont have the acting chops to deliver the material. More problematically the SEALs seldom emerge as distinct individuals putting the emphasis on the team above the sort of clear-cut characters auds expect from gung-ho action pics. Making their first feature outing producer-directors Scott Waugh and Mouse McCoy command a strong technical team with d.p. Shane Hurlbut sitting shotgun and a sound team flexing tremendous audio guns (particularly Jeffery J. Haboush Larry Benjamin and Eric Justen manning the re-recording mix). Waugh and co-editor Michael Tronick adeptly weave a vast number of camera angles and p.o.v.s together for a sure steady flow.

Hollywood meets propaganda in this rah-rah action film about an elite group of Navy Seals who circle the globe battling terrorism. (Made with the full cooperation and participation of the Navy this independent film was picked up for distribution by Relativity Media shortly after a small crew of Navy Seals earned worldwide headlines after killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan last May.) ""Valor"" stars real-life active-duty Seals -- the Wall Street Journal reports that per government regulations they received no additional pay for their acting -- intermixed with a sprinkling of professional actors including Roselyn Sanchez and Nestor Serrano. Sanchez plays a CIA operative kidnapped on foreign soil by a powerful illegal arms dealer. Heading off to rescue her after first bidding goodbye to wives girlfriends and children the Seals learn theres a linked plot involving a jihadist and suicide bombers. The Seals swing into action -- lots and lots of action. As directed by feature first-timers Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh and written by Kurt Johnstad (""300"") ""Valor"" hits all the expected beats for a blow-em-up film. It flits from one exotic location to the next powerful weapons are fired and there are speedy vehicular chases and mighty explosions both on land and on water. The only thing missing is a cynical wise-cracking buffer than buff action hero along the lines of Sylvester Stallone Bruce Willis (who already played a Navy Seal commander in ""Tears of the Sun"") or Nicolas Cage. Instead we get real Navy Seals as stars -- the two leads are billed only as Lieutenant Commander Rorke and Special Warfare Operator Chief Dave -- who give performances that are to put it diplomatically longer on modesty and soldierly competence than charisma. For action fans the film delivers action. Beyond that not so much. And heres the really confusing part if the situation with terrorists is as dire in real life as depicted here with bloodthirsty enemies of the U.S. lurking everywhere then what the heck are real Navy Seals doing wasting even a minute of their time making ""Valor"" rather than getting out there in real life and stopping the bad guys?

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 24 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English In Act of Valor a recruitment poster loosely disguised as a movie the story is fictional but the leading men are not. Thats the gimmick here In the name of realism actual Navy Seals have been cast to play themselves. Unfortunately in the name of drama theyre shipped out to the usual bogus plot - in this case something about saving America from the clutches of suicidal terrorists doubly wrapped in their beliefs and their bombs. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new action film ""Act of Valor"" Movies Act of Valor The official trailer But say this for the real Seals. As performers they are to the action genre what the male stars are to porn flicks - laughably wooden in the dialogue department yet pretty impressive wielding their weapon of choice. We first meet the Seals at the San Diego training camp skydiving from planes and in their idle hours bonding in the surf. Meanwhile out in the big bad world nasty business continues apace. A car bomb kills the U.S. ambassador in the Philippines and over in Costa Rica a CIA agent is kidnapped then tortured. Since shes sorely in need of rescuing the Seals shift into operational gear parachuting down to the jungle packing an arsenal of modern firepower along with a quaint supply of old-fashioned lingo. Lots of coded exchanges like ""Whiplash this is Blackbeard roger that."" Yes lots of rogering too. Actually these early sequences are a pleasant surprise. Co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh handle the lead-up to the derring-do with an adroit mix of aerial panoramas and bug-eyed close-ups jumpy point-of-view shots alternating with calculated slow motion. The look is stylish but clean; indeed for a few shining minutes we almost buy into the pictures casting gimmick and its claims to verisimilitude. After all the movies have conditioned us to wooden acting from our action heroes and when push comes to shoot-em-up these boys definitely have the right stuff. But then comes more of that damnable plot. The villains are twofold A Ukrainian dope-dealer-cum-arms-merchant known only as Christos and a Chechen terrorist whos tailored a fashionably new and ultra-lethal exploding vest. The latter plans to import the vests and their wearers over the Mexican border into targeted American cities. However its the former who captures our attention. As played by Alex Veadov a professional thespian the charismatic Christos steals every scene hes in especially the one set on his luxury yacht adorned with a full crew of female admirers in uniformly skimpy bikinis. Suddenly that recruitment poster takes an inadvertent but enticing turn into shallower waters Join the Christos Navy be all that you can be. Too soon its back to the brave Seals as they assemble in Mexico to do battle with the vest-smuggler along with various miscreants from the drug cartel. Although the Seals continue in fine form the co-directors seem fatigued from the journey allowing their once-clean style to degenerate into a typical mishmash of clutter and bombast. Nevertheless even amid the noisy chaos its easy to make out the moment when the code of honour meets an act of valour prompting a brave lad to take one for the team falling on a grenade in order to save his comrades. All hail that flag-waving moment when the deal is really Sealed How sweet and fitting it is to die in defence of a movie cliche.

If you get in their way chances are better than even that your head will end up splattered against a wall.As you know if you watched ads during the Super Bowl Act of Valor is peopled largely by real-life active-duty SEALs. They fire live ammo in scenes designed to make you feel like your finger is on the trigger much like the shooting games so popular with the Xbox set. When theyre away from battle which isnt often in this high-speed high-impact plunge they banter about family and trade friendly insults.If it sounds like a recruiting film thats because it is. Act of Valor directed by Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh was conceived by the Navy as a means of drumming up interest in joining the ranks. Picture the high production value of U.S. military television ads maybe that new one that caresses a massive aircraft on a clear blue ocean. Extend to 101 minutes. Mix in scant plot and character elements on one side a nice SEAL with a baby on the way; on the other a pair of hotheaded terror collaborators looking to smuggle undetectable high-tech dirty bombs into the States.Then start splattering heads.The movie doesnt pretend to be anything but propaganda a modern-day cousin to the morale-boosting documentaries made by John Huston and Frank Capra during World War II. Not only do the bad guys come bearing kung pao and Rocky Road they also interrogate a female CIA agent with a drill (instant stigmata symbolism). Meanwhile the U.S. interrogator uses an appeal to family unity. Cause thats how we roll. This is still Hollywood despite the impressive battlefield verisimilitude.Act of Valor was hatched well before SEALs helped take down Osama bin Laden but the release timing is fortuitous for the recruiting cause. Just think You could hunt terrorists and land in an action movie to boot.ACT OF VALORB Directed by Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh. Rated R (violence and torture language). 101 mins.

Joe.""       Photo AP Im not going to say ""Act of Valor"" oversimplifies manly bravado but Sylvester Stallone just called to say theres more to war than square-jawed warriors shooting villains in the teeth. The film began as a recruitment video for the Navy and more or less wound up that way. A team of highly trained SEALs jaunts around the globe rescuing a beautiful CIA agent capturing a yacht covered with bikini beauties and massacring thugs. They storm compounds spout cool-sounding jargon wax poetic about their brotherhood and never complain get tired make politically incorrect remarks eat bad food or accidentally shoot civilians. Ultimately their goal is to stop a squad of suicide bombers from sneaking across the border from Mexico and randomly slaughtering Americans at leading tourist sites. According to the movie accomplishing this goal is as simple as shooting up the rat-bag camp in Mexico where the suicide vests are stored. Refreshing as it is to see the military portrayed as something other than a band of neurotics and creeps theres a reason this brand of rah-rah and bang-bang didnt outlast the age of Whitesnake and Marty McFly. Today we live with the reality of ongoing major military missions so theyre much less easy to imagine as fantasy action sequences where people say rude things to the men torturing them and the brains of villains always end up painted across the walls of their hideouts. Moreover those 80s movies at least had Lee Marvin and an escapist quality. This movie has a no-name cast and the real-life SEALs in it are more or less interchangeably able men. It consorts with reality -- it has a grit to it along with a somber respect for necessary sacrifices that winds up with a roll call of veterans who gave their lives in recent actions -- yet it also wants to be ""G.I. Joe."" Choosing one path or the other would have been wiser and sub-Tarantino dialogue such as the remark by a SEAL that if they should fail ""This would be big trouble in little China"" -- drawing a comparison between the mass murder of US citizens by jihadists and a 1986 Kurt Russell B-movie -- comes across as foolish. Some will enjoy the many ker-blammy shootout scenes (I was bored by them) but the best parts are the reflective opening and closing which actually present some interesting thoughts on the nature of the warrior class that is so central to so much of American history and yet so mysterious. Lose a loved one and youre advised to ""Put your pain in a box lock it down."" There might be some truth to that. Still these movies in which unimpeachable heroes give a good thwacking to international evildoers always seem to be written and/or directed by armchair admirals -- men like ""Red Dawn"" auteur John Milius Tom Clancy and Stallone -- who seem to know everything about the military except the way to their local recruitment office. Those who served under fire tend to have more nuanced views. The overall feel of ""Act of Valor"" is not that of battle-tested hard men chewing over war stories but of outsiders sucking up in an effort to be granted honorary membership in a club they can never understand.

Starring Roselyn Sanchez Emilio Rivera Jason Cottle Nestor Serrano Gonzalo Menendez Ailsa Marshall Alex Veadov Drea Castro Alexander Asefa Sonny Sison Director Mike McCoy Scott Waugh Running time 145 Release Opened Feb 24 2012  Editorial Review SEALs foil plot and vice versa By Mark JenkinsFriday Feb. 24 2012Military reality and video-game fantasy shake hands and come out fighting in ""Act of Valor"" an action flick that stars actual Navy SEALs. The exercises are genuine and so is the hardware. But the script undermines the sense of authenticity at every turn. Conceived as a recruitment film ""Act of Valor"" was directed by TV-commercial veterans (and former stuntmen) Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh. Because the movie wasnt originally supposed to be a commercial feature the filmmakers got unprecedented access to guns choppers submarines and other expensive gear. This enabled them to make a blockbuster-size movie for about 12 million. The action begins immediately with a training jump near San Diego. But screenwriter Kurt Johnstad (who toiled on ""300"") is already sketching the back story. Rorke is the son of a military man for whom ""being dangerous was sacred."" (There are many lines like that.) Also hes about to learn that his wife is pregnant with their first child. Rorke is the real first name of the SEAL who plays the movies central character. (None of the SEALs surnames are revealed.) Hes clearly not trained in delivering dialogue or expressing emotion. Yet the stiffness of the Navy mens performances is less of a problem than the global-conspiracy plot thats about to commence. In Costa Rica a CIA agent is posing as a doctor while observing an international drug and arms smuggler. Her cover is blown and shes captured and tortured. Soon the SEAL team arrives for the rescue. But their work has just begun. The smuggler is a Ukrainian Jew who grew up with a Chechen Muslim who has become a terrorist. The dealer is helping the terrorist smuggle a group of Filipinos into the United States from Mexico. Theyre suicide bombers outfitted with explosive vests that supposedly cant be detected. The SEALs must follow the group all the way to the final shootout. This is where the movie enters ""Mission Impossible"" territory. In real life SEALs handle individual missions. But this movie turns them into a squad of indispensable Ethan Hunts hopping the globe to foil supervillains and following the tidy plot to its bloody conclusion. Like most recent action movies ""Act of Valor"" is fast loud and strenuously over-edited. The filmmakers successfully conjure a chaotic you-are-there sensation. Exactly whats happening however can be hard to follow. While the SEAL raid that eliminated Osama bin Laden hadnt occurred when this project began reconstructing a single assignment like that would have made for a better and more believable movie. ""Act of Valor"" is gripping when it focuses on procedural details. But whenever the movie goes Hollywood its celebration of steely competence softens into macho sentimentality.Contains strong violence including torture and profanity.

But when the movie attempts to humanize them the dialogue feels forced. Terrorists smugglers and drug traffickers are played by real actors but dont come off much better. But the real disappointment is that the heroes are almost as featureless.The featured team of Navy SEALs initially rescues a kidnapped CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez) in a brilliantly coordinated effort from air water and land. The perilous chase that follows is breathtaking. It turns out that the abducted agent had begun to uncover a jihadist plot in which suicide bombers planned to attack several American cities. The SEALs must find the terrorists before they sneak into the United States via Mexico.While the films distinguishing element is the daring missions pulled off by real-life soldiers the cinematography polishes their efforts to a glossy sheen. Seemingly inspired by classic war films like Platoon the stunning photography and evocative musical score compensate somewhat for the acting deficiencies.About the movieAct of Valor1/2 out of fourStars Navy SEALs Roselyn Sanchez Alex Veadov Jason Cottle Nestor Serrano Director Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh Distributor Relativity Media Rating R for strong violence including some torture and for language Running time 1 hour 41 minutes Opens today nationwideThe global threat feels believable enough but the dialogue by Kurt Johnstad verges on cliche ""This will make 9/11 look like a walk in the park"" says a Russian smuggler assisting the jihadists.Initially the battlefield technology and visceral quality heighten the films sense of realism. But so many people are shot in the head with blood spurting that it grows numbing.The weakest aspect is the voice-over narration in the form of a letter from a soldier to his soldier pals infant son. Veering from emotional to heavy-handed it lauds the way of the warrior with overblown verbiage and concludes with a painfully long funeral scene.Employing Navy troops as stars is a clever idea for an action thriller. But the soldiers awkward line readings are glaring enough to distract from the potency of the story. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Starring Alex Veadov Roselyn Sanchez and Nestor Serrano. Directed by Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh. (R. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Act of Valor"" should be one awesome recruitment tool for the Navy SEALs. Real bullets fly. Real SEALs do the shooting. A real submarine splashes to the surface its fearsome shadow rising from the water. Real parajumpers leap into the sky. Real flames lick wildly out of real explosions and real tension mounts as buff warriors in camo huff through the jungle on their mission to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent. Good or bad the damn thing moves. This shouldnt be too surprising given its directors the Bandito Brothers Scott Waugh and Mike McCoy and given its conception as a Defense Department publicity stunt. Its intended to wow audiences with high-test action while planting a giant wet kiss on the smacker of the U.S. military - and it scores at both tasks. For what it is its well done well filmed well outfitted with ordnance and well exciting. However in script characters and plot ""Act of Valor"" offers only the barest minimum. The filmmakers are so intent on shooting the real SEAL deal that they forget this is supposed to be a movie We need a story. Something with suspense and actual character development. Something that doesnt ruin its biggest suspense in the films opening minutes when one SEAL narrates a letter to the unborn son of another SEAL who dies in action. Both are played by active-duty SEALs whose identities are not revealed. But one man lives one man dies and the fate of each is clearly announced in the films opening sequence. The grittiness of the movie the thud of its bullets and the thrumming energy of its covert ops - these are its strong suits. That active SEALs are playing loosely fictive versions of themselves adds oomph to the proceedings but the film gets snagged by its own narrative convention.

Daily Edition Login to download Act of Valor Film Review 307 PM PST 2/23/2012 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Docu and drama join forces for an ambitious Navy SEAL mission that falls short of accomplished. TWITTER A blend of reality and fiction Relativitys film about Navy SEALS stars actual active-duty recruits. Setting out to be the real deal of Navy SEAL movies Act of Valor goes beyond the likes of Charlie Sheen and Demi Moore with a blend of reality and fiction played out by a cast of actors and actual active-duty recruits. But the well-intentioned stab at manufactured authenticity yields a mixed bag of results. STORY Act of Valor Premiere Enlists Navy SEAL Talent Showcased in Film Although the film has its undeniably immersive convincing moments the merging of dramatic re-creations and on-camera ""performances"" proves less seamlessly executed than those masterfully coordinated land sea and air missions. That said with its arrival as SEAL heroism is riding high the Relativity release could make a serious splash with a relatively clear opening-weekend shot at targeted young-male audiences. It also could be edited into one heck of a recruitment video. Directed by Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh former stuntmen with extensive action-sports credits Valor does a sufficiently valiant job holding the fort until Kathryn Bigelows untitled bin Laden thriller lands in theaters in December. The film comes closer in tone to Bigelows The Hurt Locker than to G.I. Jane as it follows a team of SEALs initially deployed to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez) in Costa Rica. VIDEO Act of Valor Trailer Shows Real Navy SEALS on a Fictional Mission But their mission widens considerably in international scope upon uncovering a terrorism plot involving suicide bombers wearing vests filled with hundreds of ceramic ball bearings containing explosive gel. Taking its cue from real-life SEAL operations the script penned by Kurt Johnstad (300) layers in more traditional dramatic elements depicting relationships among the men and with their families back home. While the Intel-infused re-enactments pack a propulsive punch the other interactions -- requiring those individuals to essentially play themselves -- tend to be more stiffly executed. One notable exception is an energetic interrogation sequence between ranking SEAL Senior Chief Van O a man with a bushy gray beard and wildly intense eyes and a cool customer of a terrorist mastermind (actor Alex Veadov). Visually cinematographer Shane Hurlbut (Terminator Salvation) lends the bumpy picture a unifying visceral grit and editors Waugh and Michael Tronick (Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith) keep the combat adrenaline pumping.

The adventure film ""Act of Valor"" stars active-duty U.S. Navy SEALs in leading roles. In an unprecedented partnership between an independent film company and the Navy the commandos were filmed in exotic locations on training exercises with live weapons fire. Those documentary-style scenes were subsequently woven into a plot involving a jihadist suicide attack on Americas largest cities. The result is a film with a facade of authenticity stretched across an armature of comic-book heroism and absurd villainy. Commenters pause a moment. ""Act of Valor"" is not a good movie. This does not mean that I do not support our troops or that I sympathize with our nations enemies or that I dont know the men onscreen do more for our nation in a day than Americas assembled movie critics accomplish in their collective careers. What it means is that I think these real-life action heroes deserve a better movie. So does the audience. The plot While rescuing a female CIA agent from the kidnappers jungle base the men of Bandito Squadron recover a cellphone stuffed with intelligence secrets. A Muslim fanatic assisted by a Russian smuggler intends to move suicide bombers across the Mexican border. Kurt Johnstads script is generally light on ingenuity but here he achieves a hat trick hitting three ethnic hot buttons in a single plot. It is later bluntly established that the jihadists Russian enabler is a Jew perhaps for extra credit. The military players (whose identities are closely guarded by the Department of Defense and dont appear in the credits) are world-class experts at running with weapons which is all that ""Act of Valor"" requires of them. They all have the same haircut basic speech patterns mannerisms and all-American attitude. It would have been good to make them vivid individuals easier to tell apart but no such luck. Johnstad one of the five credited writers on ""300"" deals in types not people. He revives such stock figures as Serviceman Leaving Pregnant Wife Behind Scar-Faced Villain Damsel in Distress ""Bad Cop"" Interrogator and Sadistic Torturer. This is not presented as an homage to bygone war films but as a sort of dumbed-down ""Why We Fight."" Co-directors Mike ""Mouse"" McCoy and Scott Waugh are TV commercial directors specializing in high-octane spots for brands like Mountain Dew and NASCAR. ""Act of Valor"" initially was conceived as a public relations tool to drive recruitment. On that level it may be a success as it makes combat resemble a thrilling first-person-shooter video game. As a combat film its fine. As a social and historical document it seems certain to generate bad feelings on all sides. If were going to cast our fighting forces in fiction films lets honor them with projects worthy of them.

How do you take your trees? I couldnt have known before seeing ""Act of Valor but I prefer mine in heavy camouflage face paint and capable of demolishing a Mexicali neighborhood run by a wildly armed drug cartel. I prefer my trees to be Navy SEALs particularly the real-life ones whove been recruited to star in this peculiarly entertaining exercise in bare-bones Hollywood-style action heroism. The movie lasts a little more than 100 minutes but we can tell in about two that discovery of tomorrows Poitiers or De Niros will have to wait until perhaps well tomorrow. When these men speak you suddenly realize how uniquely good those Ents were in ""Lord of the Rings.Its true that the active-duty SEALs playing the SEALs - were not permitted to know their names for security reasons - have one facial expression and one tone of voice. Ask them to speak to each other about such nonmilitary business as life love fatherhood patriotism or surfing and the movie becomes a commercial for some yet-to-be-sold masculinizing pharmaceutical. Dudetrek or Bropecia. Something like that.In all the studiously manly borderline monosyllabic frequently terrible often explanatory dialogue - ""moving with tertiary extract - might leave you parched for charisma. But ""Act of Valor is certain to be showing right next to ""Safe House the box-office hit with Denzel Washington as a CIA operative gone sour. Though very little compares to Washingtons swaggering cool ""Act of Valor is a roller-coaster ride. ""Safe House is a parked car.The casting in ""Act of Valor of course leads to the movies innovations. Dialogue that chiefly entails laying out tactics for missions executed in the next scene pretty much obviates any need for Kenneth Branagh. Having the military play itself is propaganda on one hand and simple efficiency on the other. It also concentrates the movie-going publics attraction to combat as spectacle. So why bother with a star if what weve come to see ultimately are the talents of the stunt crew?As it happens ""Act of Valor was directed by Mike ""Mouse McCoy and Scott Waugh a couple of veteran stuntmen who dont simply admire the SEALs defiance of death. They appear to relate to it. Written by Kurt Johnstad whos a credited writer of ""300 the film involves a typical doomsday plot that manages to combine separate international affronts. A SEAL platoon heads into the tropics to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez) whos been tracking the connection between a Ukrainian drug smuggler (Alex Veadov) and a mass-murdering Chechen jihadist (Jason Cottle) whose bond is tighter than initially suspected.The smuggler is helping the jihadist execute a plot to destroy a handful of American cities using state-of-the-art bomb vests strapped to lowly Filipinos. What results are stressful action sequences in jungles amid shanties and on a yacht. And the Chechen is a villain whose sense of high fashion and culture makes him amusingly loathsome. When he enters the vest-bomb manufacturers warehouse a man is playing music. ""Mendelssohn? he asks. ""No. Brahms. Accordingly there is beauty in this movie that youd never experience in any film starring Chuck Norris or Michael Dudikoff. The sound mix keeps suspenseful quiet while you marvel at what perfect amphibians the SEALs are and how with them killing people places a crucial premium on gentleness (the SEALs tiptoeing down a hallway stirring the air with hand signals tapping a shoulder or falling through the night sky). If only the frantic editing had managed to linger longer on the dreaminess of those shots.Trying to reconcile the movies poetic imagery and intermittent narration with all the killing bombing and shooting (using live ammunition) produces far more confusion than Mendelssohn and Brahms. Malick? No. Bruckheimer and Bay Who else do we have to thank for the shots in ""Act of Valor in which the sun appears to sizzle like a peach on a grill? Where else would we find a man who keeps a big American flag folded in his pocket?Really the films presiding spirit of American might and international intimidation is that of Tom Clancy. Hes credited as an advisor on this film and his influence shows up from time to time. A scene between a SEAL and the smuggler is among the best in the movie. The two men trade insinuations and the tension is strong. Veadov is a better actor than the SEAL. But this SEAL with his graying beard and wry sense of humor has better lines. A sharply done encounter like that implies just what Clancy may have advised.The SEALs profile is higher since a team killed Osama Bin Laden last year. There hasnt been this much popular interest since Demi Moore fought to join a similar outfit in ""G.I. Jane. ""Act of Valor creates an illusion of authenticity while doing strategically little to dispel the groups mystique. Often with an action film you know that what youre watching has been staged. You applaud the rigorous theater. Here when the films climactic sequence has ended theres no impulse to clap. The verisimilitude holds you in moral check.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

The advantage of that tactic is that the guys look right in camouflage and handle military ordnance smartly. More about Act of Valor >> The problem is that these stoic warriors infect Act of Valor with more wooden acting than youd see at a ventriloquism school. Fortunately the pros in the cast especially the ones playing the bad guys rave it up so wildly that it all nulls out. The film is basically three covert missions (of diminishing interest) stapled together. But first we must establish the despicably evil nature of our enemies. They wouldnt They would? Schoolchildren? That tears it Shoot until your guns melt boys Theres a villainous Jihadist conspiracy in the works one thats ""going to make 9/11 look like a walk in Grand Central Park."" Right. If only there were such a place. Curiously for how often the global aspects of this plot are stressed the SEALs team engages over and over only with drug thugs from Mexico and Central America. One suspects its a budgetary consideration. Directors Scott Waugh and Mouse McCoy who promote themselves as the Bandito Brothers swipe a number of visual devices from video games (probably an accurate indication of their target audience). In fact many of the action scenes use the same point of view as first-person-shooter games - youre jogging through terrain with green-tinted night vision and the barrel of your rifle is bobbing in front of you. This gamer facade is what makes Act of Valor disturbing in the end. The killing becomes cold and clinical. You watch as one of our snipers dispassionately and from a great distance lays out these scruffy untrained campesinos one after the other with graphic head shots. Near the end the film degenerates into an extended chaotic firefight. You know who youre supposed to be rooting for because theyre the ones wearing uniforms but its easy to lose touch with why. Act of Valor lacks the most basic filmic technique of personalizing the battle. Sound meets fury. In a neutral setting. Shouldnt our SEALs at least get home-screen advantage?

Act of Valor Fair Directors Mike McCoy Scott Waugh. Cast Alex Veadov Roselyn Sanchez Nestor Serrano. Rating R for strong violence including torture and language. In many ways it is -- for professional actors. At the beginning of the film directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh appear on-screen explaining that not only are the service members in the movie not professionally trained actors but that live ammunition was used in much of the action footage. But they go on to say that once they had met the SEALs -- the film did start out as a recruiting tool -- and spent years embedded with them while observing the sacrifice their job requires and the toll it takes on their families ""how could an actor truly portray that?"" Pretty well Id guess if he were good enough. This is not to demean in any way the work the SEALs do. They killed Osama bin Laden They are heroic in ways those of us who sit on the sidelines can never comprehend. They deserve all the honor we can bestow upon them and I mean that genuinely. But that doesnt make them good actors and it doesnt make ""Act of Valor"" a good movie. Its an OK one -- the strategy sessions for raids are fascinating and the action itself is outstanding. But it would benefit greatly from having real actors in the major roles. That the bad guys -- who are actors -- are more charismatic is certainly not due to the fact that we are on their side. Its because they know how to make us want to watch. The film begins with the SEALs or in their parlance ""operators"" about to embark on a mission the extraction of a woman who has been kidnapped. We learn that Lt. Cmdr. Rorke -- the SEALs arent credited so its not clear if that is really his name -- is about to become a father and that Chief Dave is a father of five who cant keep the news of Rorkes fatherhood quiet. Its nice enough but the portrayals are wooden the sentiments cliched. Soon however the SEALs are on the move ready to snatch the kidnapped woman from her captors. The build-up and execution are flat-out insane in a good way. This is the rare case in which jerky hand-held cameras are of benefit; they add to the realism and suspense. What was supposed to have been a one-shot affair leads to a much bigger problem A jihadist (Jason Cottle) is working to send suicide bombers into the U.S. with advanced weapons; his childhood friend who happens to be an arms dealer (Alex Veadov) is helping in this pursuit -- and the clock is ticking. That means springing again into action which is in itself one of the more interesting plot points. When duty calls for these guys there is no rest no time to recuperate. You have just risked your life to save someone you dont know and never really will. Now go do it again. Screenwriter Kurt Johnstad plows ahead in a relatively straightforward predictable manner (he also wrote ""300""). It is the kind of story this sort of film demands and if the applause from the audience at the screening I attended is any indication its the kind of story many people want. But while the intentions behind ""Act of Valor"" are sterling the story could have been told better. One wishes the filmmakers had trusted it to professional actors who might have more fully realized the material.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday February 23 2012 1200 PM Title Act of Valor Film Info R Violence. At area theaters. Seeing a group of real-life Navy SEALs - men accustomed to extreme amounts of heroism and danger - give what laypeople call ""acting"" in the docu-fiction hybrid ""Act of Valor"" is like watching the wrestlers in dramas produced by the WWE Theyre great at what they do but being in front of the camera isnt part of that. Not that its their fault. ""Act of Valor"" is officially sanctioned by U.S. Naval Special Warfare and directed by members of the Bandito Brothers a group of ex-stuntmen-turned-producers of highly adrenalized commercial projects. The result is a big-screen recruitment film infused with a hero worship SEALs typically shun. Combine that with thudding action and a script that bends awful dialogue around military jargon (""Get your frogman on"" ""Were 12 clicks off"") and you have to quote one SEAL after his pal loses an eye ""a bum deal for Mikey."" Screenwriter Kurt Johnstads plot reportedly stitches together elements of actual missions. A smarmy smuggler Christo (Alex Veadov) is aiding scary jidahist Shabal (Jason Cottle) in getting well-equipped suicide bombers into America. An eight-man SEAL team uncovers the plot while rescuing a captured CIA operative (Roselyn Sanchez). They drop into foreign lands skulk through foliage and go underwater before bursting into huts. Why exactly real SEALs were needed to maintain the authenticity of such standard action-movie scenarios is a mystery. Directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh created a short documentary for Naval Special Warfare and insisted that these men could best depict SEAL life in a fictionalized Hollywood-ized adventure. They do have a brawny bonhomie. Some though stumble into their charisma. When a senior officer called ""Senior"" interrogates Veadov -- an Al Pacino wanna-be in rectangular art-director glasses -- its as if theyre in a high school film students project honoring Jerry Bruckheimers 90s oeuvre. These are all decent real guys who consistently go to hell and back. They went above and beyond by being in ""Act of Valor"" a movie nicely dedicated to fallen comrades. Now it can be a Navy secret like the location of nuclear subs which also contain bombs.

(AP Photo/ Relativity Media) Courtesy of IATM LLC In this image released by Relativity Media a scene is shown from the film ""Act of Valor"" starring real active-duty Navy SEALs. (AP Photo/ Relativity Media) ""Act of Valor"" isnt so much a movie as a recruiting tool. Literally. It was commissioned by the Navy to attract new SEALs then it grew it into a feature-length film with a story line and with active-duty personnel playing the key roles.On its own terms ""Act of Valor"" seems to be a realistic depiction of close-quarters combat with live ammo flying around the rough-edged heroes as they bust into terrorist hideouts. But anyone hoping for context or complexity should volunteer to infiltrate a good book.Ostensibly based on real cases it shuttles from Costa Rica where a CIA agent is captured and tortured by drug-running thugs; to Ukraine where a narco kingpin is plotting with a jihadist pal to smuggle suicide bombs into the United States; to Mexico where lowly human mules are ordered to schlep the explosive vests though border-town tunnels. By unspecified means U.S. intelligence is able to track the baddies and they counterattack with their best men 10-or-so SEALs who are played by actual American heroes.The characters are given sketchy background stories including a band-of-brothers subplot about a father-to-be squad leader and his surfer-dude subordinate. But notwithstanding the salty dialogue the other characters are patriotic cut-outs and a good-cop interrogation scene on a luxury yacht doesnt square with whats been leaked about Guantanamo and other rendition sites around the world.Of course the target audience for this movie is more interested in video games than geopolitical veracity and on a tactical basis ""Act of Valor"" hits the bulls-eye. Much of the fast-moving action was filmed during training exercises and it has the first-person-shooter perspective that potential recruits find so seductive. Within this limited perspective the movie has no room to scrutinize the policies for which the brave SEALs are fighting.""Act of Valor"" is a competently directed action movie but forcing the audience to wear such narrow goggles is a dereliction of duty.

"Review Act of Valor - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Recruiting tool wrestles with its gamelike focus in Act of Valor  Act of Valor Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Made with or without U.S. Department of Defense cooperation fictional films about the American military favor narratives in which (mostly) men buck authority risk their necks in bouts of jealous infighting and go the lone-wolf route in pursuit of the enemy.""Act of Valor""has no time for that lack of teamwork. Its Navy Sea Air and Land team warriors better known as SEALs collaborate without friction. They stick to the plan or adapt it when needed. Authority is not bucked. Voices are raised only under fire. And the SEALs played in this films rather strange mixture of real-life and hoked-up heroics by active-duty SEALs spit out authentic mission jargon without stopping dead to explain what ""hot extract"" means to the civilians. Heres how a frankly strange film came to be. According to Rear Adm. Denny Moynihan of the Navy Office of Information quoted in The New York Times the Navy was looking for approximately 500 more SEALs than they had at the ready. Then came ""a series of initiatives to try to attract more people"" Moynihan said. ""This film was one of those initiatives.""All movies start somewhere; this one derives from a seven-minute training video on the Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewmen. Sports documentary veterans Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh expanded on their short film once the Navy signed off on a fictionalized SEALs adventure. ""300"" co-writer Kurt Johnstad wrote a script. The real-life SEALs share the screen with such actors as Roselyn Sanchez as a covert CIA agent who in one scene endures power-drill torture before being rescued by SEAL commandos. ""Act of Valor"" plays like a highly favorable SEALs tribute placed atop a vaguely bogus storyline. After a bloody Philippines-set prologue the story follows a SEALs team sent into Costa Rica to extract Sanchezs Morales whose captors work for an oily drug lord (played by Alex Veadov). Theres a larger problem too involving the smugglers Chechen Muslim associate (Jason Cottle) whose plans for global terrorism include a multicity attack on the U.S.Thanks to its nonprofessional actors facility with weaponry ""Act of Valor"" contains shots and parts of entire sequences that feel different and truer than the average war picture. The filmmakers access to a full range of modern weaponry including a nuclear submarine lends an aura of credibility -- that is at least until the combat sequences obsess again and again on splattery kill shots to the head. The action beats come straight out of the video game ""Call of Duty."" And when you have real SEALs placed in a picture that lives and dies on the same old first-person-shooter aesthetic you have a film divided against itself.""No one is stronger and more dangerous than a man who can harness his emotions"" we hear at one point in a eulogy. I wish ""Act of Valor"" conveyed more of that real danger.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for strong violence including some torture and for language)Running time 141Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Act of Valor (movie) Petroleum Industry Gaming Central Intelligence Agency Roselyn Sanchez 10 movies to see this winter Crazy Horse Legendary documentarian lays bare a cabarets appeal  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0221-act-of-valor-20120223,0,1839553.column",200,actofvalor30,actofvalor,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet First things first Navy SEALs are American heroes. The top-secret elite fighting force takes on a lot of dangerous missions including killing Osama bin Laden in a daring raid rescuing hostages and performing tasks to which the general public isnt and will never be privy. Theyre trained in advance techniques and weaponry and have honed such specialized skills that in some respects Act Of Valors introductory explanation in which co-directors Mouse McCoy and Scott Waugh explain they had no choice but to cast actual SEALs in the film makes sense. After all what actor could fake what SEALs do for a living? (And lets leave Charlie Sheen and the 1990 movie Navy SEALs out of it.) But in other respects the casting of active-duty Navy SEALs here makes no sense at all. Acting is a specialized skill too albeit one less essential to national security and the films SEAL stars--billed only by their first names to protect their identities--look about as comfortable in front of the camera as a pampered Hollywood star would look taking live enemy fire. Act Of Valor began as a training film and its best in the portions that still feel like one. One sequence focuses on the sometimes-fascinating details of what it takes to pull off a stealth raid. When a sniper takes out the guard of a drug lords lakeside compound its a two-man operation one to pull the trigger and another to catch the body to avoid a telltale splash. Trouble is the directors--a pair of stuntmen directing their first feature and collectively known as the Bandito Brothers--dont have much of a flair for staging such scenes and even less of a grasp on how to shoot action once the fighting starts in earnest. Their handheld camerawork and frenetic editing makes it tough to figure out whats going on; its all the chaos of a Michael Bay movie with none of the slickness. And while the team does have access to equipment and vehicles that might make Bay envious they dont apparently have access to say the sort of lighting equipment typically used in professional filmmaking. A middle-of-the-night parachute drop for instance might be thrilling if it didnt look like a bunch of shadows rippling against a sea of blackness. As for the story it pits the SEALs against a narcotics kingpin working in league with a terrorist to smuggle suicide bombers across the Mexican border into the U.S. a plot that takes the heroes across the globe. Its thin material to say the least and manipulative to boot putting women children and a SEAL father-to-be in jeopardy in ways more about servicing cheap thrills than any larger point about the perilous state of the world in 2012. The film claims to be inspired by ""real acts of valor"" and ends with a dedication to SEALs whose lives have been lost since 9/11. But is using their sacrifices as material for an action movie--and a bad one--that much of an honor?

Act of Valor Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2012) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/act-of-valor-2012,200,actofvalor32,actofvalor,rogerebert
"Act of Valor | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; act-of-valor ) Act of Valor (United States 2012) February 22 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching a movie like Act of Valor it becomes clear how much synergy currently exists between film and video games. As the latter becomes increasingly more ""cinematic"" in the way action is depicted there are times when the former adopts the style and approach favored by some games. Act of Valor is one such example; the experience of watching it unfold feels almost incomplete without a controller gripped tightly in two sweaty hands. Character and narrative have largely been jettisoned in favor of depicting several high-energy ""missions"" that are loosely connected. Act of Valors ""hook"" which can be seen as either a marketing gimmick or a genuine attempt to do things a little differently is that the Navy SEALs in the film are played by real-life active SEALs. As a result the lead actors are unnamed (to protect the identity of the soldiers) the level of dramatic acting is on par with what can be expected from a high school play and the Navy had approval of the final cut. The result is a too-thick sense of reverence for the SEALs; instead of being rounded characters they are types akin to the brave men in John Waynes The Green Berets. White hats abound; these men are not just physically superior patriots - they embody all thats good and true about human nature. Theres something old-fashioned and a little refreshing about a movie that unabashedly represents its protagonists as heroes but it gets in the way of seeing the SEALs in Act of Valor as real people. Instead the leads are most readily identified as ""the lieutenant with the baby on the way"" and ""the chief with a large family."" Act of Valors first mission sends the SEALs into Central America to rescue a captured CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez) who is being tortured by terrorists. The chief bad guys are a smuggler named Christo (Alex Veadov) and an Islamic nutjob named Karimov (Dimiter Marinov) who have joined forces to plant 18 suicide bombers in strategic locations across the United States. Their goal kill thousands of people and create a world economic collapse. Act of Valor traces groups of SEALs as they capture targets glean important information (without resorting to torture - that would blemish the white hats) and stop the terrorists before they cross the U.S. border with Mexico. The narrative as a whole is not well developed and is at times borderline-incoherent; the riveting aspect of Act of Valor is the battles. Often presented from a first-person perspective shot by a shaky camera Act of Valors firefights are glorious examples of cinematic chaos. They make the battle scenes in Black Hawk Down seem like well-ordered precise depictions of modern warfare. The fact that its often difficult and sometimes impossible to figure out whats going on is of limited concern since were not invested in any of the characters. Who lives or dies isnt important; whats important is the experience. Its Call of Dut (or any similar game) on the big screen and theres a visceral thrill. Only afterward does it become clear how hollow and empty it all is. The incorporation of SEALs into the fabric of Act of Valors production strips away a layer of Hollywood sheen from the vision of combat represented here. In broad strokes its not that different from what we have seen dozens of times before but the details hint at an insiders perspective. Little things like the release of an unmanned drone to monitor activities during the rescue operation or the way the SEALs get on and off a submarine are what make Act of Valor more intriguing than the average entry into this genre - even if it sometimes comes across as a Navy recruiting film. Act of Valor isnt a movie in any real or meaningful sense. What is it? A hybrid perhaps? A glimpse into the future of blockbuster entertainment where the thrill of the moment assembled for an audience with a microsecond attention span trumps all other concerns? I suspect most gamers will appreciate this if only for the familiarity it provides. The best I can say is that I was never bored although I was never overwhelmed either. There are enough small things to keep it interesting even when many of the big things fail.

It stars real active-duty Navy SEALs and as the uniformed representative of the New York Coast Guard 9th Regiment who introduced my screening explained much of it was filmed with live-fire ammunition.None of the above works to strengthen the muddled movies dramatic narrative but the films boasted authenticity--including cameos from the latest in military hardware--and its closing dedication ""to all the warriors headed downrange in the future"" make clear the aim This is the most lavish recruiting tool the armed forces have deployed to theaters in memory besting that pre-movie commercial with the ""freedom aint so free"" Kid Rock soundtrack a few years back.The SEAL actors go uncredited but at the center of Act of Valor are ""Chief Dave"" and ""Lieutenant Commander Rorke"" two minimally charismatic studs who compete to deliver lines in the deepest bass-baritone. (You can remember which is which only because one of them keeps a toothpick in the corner of his mouth.)After a suicide bombing at the International School in Jakarta Dave Rorke and the cursorily introduced members of their team must deploy to the likes of Costa Rica the Sudan and Mexico to follow the border-hopping conspiracy of a jihadist network led by a Ukrainian-born convert to Islam Abul Shabal (Jason Cottle) arranging to purchase the latest in suicide-bomb technology from his boyhood friend an arms dealer (Alex Veadov).Despite that setup the villains come across as individuals rather more compellingly than do the films ostensible heroes mostly mouthpieces for warrior credo recited in voiceover (""No one is more dangerous than a man who can harness his emotions"" etc.). This is the prose of 300 co-screenwriter Kurt Johnstad again showing his obvious reverence for martial values though this time without a mythological visual analogue. The workaday soldiers dialogue heard here has one suspects the same relation to the real thing as the network-television micd talk of football players does to an actual unobserved huddle.You might argue that individual faces dont matter here as individuals arent the heroes of Act of Valor so much as is the organization the unit. But if this is an homage to teamwork its no great shakes at clarifying how a team works. The combat footage meant to show the unit working in tandem was shot in large part with helmet-mounted cameras a POV familiar to the films targeted demographic from tactical first-person-shooter video games. This obscures any broader understanding of physical relationships for an ""immersive"" cacophony of first-person perspectives More than any cinematic precedent Act of Valor most closely resembles the latest upgrade of Americas Army the multiplayer recruitment-drive game launched by the U.S. military in 2002.The films first set piece is the best a personnel-recovery mission that breaks away into a parallel-action chase capped by a gunboat pulling around a bend in the river mini-gun erupting with the fanfare of arriving cavalry. But that basic tactical clarity otherwise escapes Act of Valor Its all about you-are-there adrenaline injections a string of jolts to work up an appetite for the real thing.
