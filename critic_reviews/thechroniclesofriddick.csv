Such as did co-stars Diesel and Dench ever occupy the same set or were the good ladys digitally aided scenes spliced in via satellite? Is the films little-understood underverse a revolving-door Hades or a particularly poetic line of futurist intimate garment? Is this a movie or a projected video game? The compartmentalised narrative and CGI cityscapes strongly suggest the latter though the rote recyclings of Mad Max and The Matrix betray a few too many cinematic origins as the grumpy musclebound ex-con Riddick reluctantly battles a crusading army of death-fetishist Necromongers. All that said the sequel baton pass at the finale is pretty nifty but its surely asking too much to think the filmmakers could leave us wanting more. Come to think of it much much less would have been best.

Riddick from the cult sci-fi movie ""Pitch Black."" It is five years after the events of the first film. Since then Riddick -- a big strapping dude with ice-blue eyes for night vision and a vocal cadence that suggests Elmer Fudd on steroids -- has spent his time ducking from space-age mercenaries. Seems theres a price on his head. The story begins when Riddick is captured on the planet Helion by the occupying forces of Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) whose nasty army of Necromongers are hellbent on subjugation of all beings. Lifes like that in outer space. The bad guys shove Riddick into a hard-core underground prison on the volcanic planet of Crematoria. There he reencounters Kyra (Alexa Davalos) a woman he has some history with; he rescued her back in the old days when she was a wee gal. Since then she has aged into a tough no-nonsense femme-warrior whos about 20 years too late for a bit part in ""The Road Warrior."" Also in the story Thandie Newton as Dame Vaako a quasi-dominatrix leader the partner of Vaako (Karl Urban) -- both are clearly going to figure in the next ""Riddick"" movie -- and Keith David who reprises his ""Pitch Black"" role as Imam. And speaking of dames it seems to bring gravitas to a space-age flick you have to hire a Brit. Which is why we find Dame Judi Dench playing Aereon an ambassador of the ""Elemental"" race whos able to transform herself float in the air and move through objects. Its momentary fun to see her in this trashy flick. And she acquits herself well but who would doubt she could? Of course Dame Judi is a mere plot vassal in the Diesel scheme of things. The muddy convoluted story revolves around the stars cool-guy poses and one-liners. ""Who do I have to kill to get this payday offa my head?"" he retorts at the beginning of the movie. And to continue Riddicks deification a kid sidles up to him and asks ""Riddick are you going to stop the new monsters?"" (""Shane"" this aint.) Riddick is the chosen one you see. Even the children look up to him. Those same kids the moviemakers hope will also be queuing to rent this movie later. Will Riddick break out of Crematoria with Kyra? Will he find himself in a bruising mano a mano finale with the Lord Marshal on the Necromonger command ship? Ask yourself Has anyone ever kept the Vinster down? No scary space creature no Lord Marshal and certainly no snotty review. THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK (PG-13 115 minutes) -- Contains sci-fi violence noise and some obscenity. Area theaters.

In the follow-up writer-director David Twohy decided to subscribe to the More Is More school of filmmaking. Diesels biceps arent just big theyre swollen to the point of looking like Thanksgiving Day balloons; his character faces an army of not hundreds but thousands of masked and armored soldiers who fan out across an elaborate landscape like so many black-shelled cicadas. <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad26;sz=300x250;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086963882435?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad27;sz=160x600;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086963882435?""></a> <a href=""http//ad.doubleclick.net/jump/wpni.artsandlivingarticle/movies/reviews;dir=reviewsnode;dir=artsandliving;dir=movies;dir=reviews;page=article;kw=;ad=ss;ad=bb;ad=hp;pos=ad24;sz=336x850;tile=20;abr=ie;ord=1086963882435?""></a> ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" doesnt hark back merely to the classic horror or science fiction canon but to nearly every single cinematic genre in the book from westerns to film noir to sword-and-sandal epics. The scale is massive the volume incalculable the mishmash of historical and literary references too thick to untangle. This will provide plenty to chew on for admirers of Riddick the cynical neo-noir protagonist played by Diesel with monosyllabic hauteur. And as what amounts to a huge advertisement for a video game it succeeds in tantalizing prospective players with lots of new places characters and story lines. Most important it ends on a deliciously unexpected note just begging for another installment. If much of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is visually unintelligible lost in a welter of whipsaw editing blurry close-ups and strobe lights it wont matter to fans who have waited four long years for the next chapter in their antiheros gritty adventures. As that chapter opens Riddick is a hunted man being chased by a spaceship full of mercenaries or ""mercs."" The man who hired them is a Janus-masked figure named Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) head of the Necromongers a huge army of nihilistic crusaders bent on converting the entire universe to their belief in nothingness. Why Riddick has been singled out for capture eludes him  in the tradition of the noir heroes hes based on he just wants to be left alone  until halfway through the movie. At that point his past has already caught up with him during a visit to New Mecca a peaceable multicultural kingdom that flies in the face of the Necromongers obsession with racial purity. He will also cross paths with one of his cronies from ""Pitch Black"" all grown up with an attitude almost as snarly as his. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" which calls to mind such comic book franchises as ""X-Men"" and ""Hellboy"" in its internal logic and densely woven mythology manages to put its hero in a number of perilous situations from which he always ingeniously escapes (just dont look too hard at why hes in those situations in the first place or the whole thing will fall apart). At one point the pumped-up Riddick  his milky blue eyes hidden behind a pair of ever-present goggles  leads a ragtag crew on a race over a 700-degree planet called Crematoria outrunning a tsunami of molten lava in a set piece that suggests what will happen the day after the day after tomorrow. These moments would be kind of fun if Twohy calmed down long enough to let them sink in; instead he keeps piling on the visuals at a frenetic pace. This is particularly irksome during the fight scenes. ""Whos the better killer?"" Riddick asks an ally during one pivotal confrontation. With such a lack of visual coherence on-screen who would know? Diesel has clearly been cast for his tightly coiled physique rather than his acting ability; whereas most acting coaches are off camera with a script in their hands you picture his with a pail of raw meat yelling ""This time youre really angry"" Hes no Bogart whose world-weary loners Riddick is meant to recall but he does make an effective human King Kong a character the movie refers to almost as often. Laying it on ever thicker Twohy has created an often eye-popping world of his own in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" from the warm-toned Andalusian-themed New Mecca to the fascist baroque-monumental aesthetic of the Necromongers. And he has created some interesting new characters including a futuristic Lady Macbeth (Thandie Newton) and a lovely ectoplasmic oracle played by Judi Dench. Every time these two formidable actresses are on the screen ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" threatens to become a serious movie but theyre quickly overwhelmed by another indecipherable rampage or outsize visual effect. Bigger may not always be better but for these filmmakers its obviously the point. The Chronicles of Riddick  (115 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for language and intense sequences of violent action.

E-mail this article Print this article Search archive Most e-mailed articles Other links Movies and showtimes Search movies Sign up for movies e-mail Dont think you have to see ""Pitch Black"" to understand its sequel the sci-fi/action-thriller ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" I saw ""Pitch Black"" two weeks ago and I still didnt get all of ""Riddick."" The terms come at you -- excuse me Vin -- fast and furious. Necromongers. Furyans. The Purifier. The Underverse. Crematoria. Of course these terms couldve originated in one of Riddicks other showcases a 2000 TV production a 30-minute animated feature being released this month or the ""Riddick"" video game. Its a whole other universe out there. To paraphrase e.e. cummings Lets not go. Worse its Gene Roddenberrys universe. ""Pitch Black"" borrowed heavily from ""Alien"" and now ""Riddick"" is boldly going where Capt. Picard has gone before. Basically Riddick is fighting a race similar to ""Star Treks"" Borg aliens that destroy planets and assimilate survivors. The Borg were more mechanized though and thus scarier. The Necromongers (awful name) have a quasi-religious bent. ""Convert now or fall forever"" they say. (Not exactly the Borgs famous observation ""Resistance is futile."") Necromonger iconography is dark Egyptian although some wear chain mail like medieval knights while others borrow the long leather coats of Nazi officers. Apparently planets are being assimilated into a very large wardrobe department. So its five years after ""Pitch Black"" and Riddick (Vin Diesel) who just wants to be left alone is being pursued by mercenaries or mercs and suspects his old pal Imam (Keith David) of fronting the money. He confronts him (with a blade) and learns that Imams planet is about to be taken over by Necromongers. Will Riddick help? ""Not my fight"" he responds laconically. Of course it becomes his fight. In the ensuing onslaught Riddick is captured and the Necromongers are curious about him particularly the Lord Marshall (Colm Feore). Riddicks a Furyan and its been prophesied that a Furyan will overthrow the empire. Before the audience can blink though or distinguish among the various Necromongers Riddick escapes and is then recaptured by the mercs who take him to Crematoria a subterranean prison planet. There he becomes reacquainted with Jack who in ""Pitch Black"" was a 12-year-old tomboy. In the intervening years shes blossomed into a tall ass-kicking French model (Alexa Davalos). We should all have such puberties. ""Riddick"" wants to be epic but feels stunted -- like its hemmed in by an adolescent boys imagination. It introduces too many characters including Thandie Newton as an over-the-top Lady Macbeth schemer and Dame Judi Dench of all dames as an ambassador from a ghostlike race. The villains meanwhile have a huge absurd Achilles heel. Diesel makes a fine action star and some of the fight scenes are cool but resistance is recommended.

Even Vin Diesel cant toughen up flabby Riddick 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Chronicles of Riddick Action. Starring Vin Diesel Judi Dench and Colm Feore. Directed by David Twohy. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Vin Diesel is the most commanding and charismatic movie star of the new century and he makes it possible to sit through ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" without climbing the walls. With his impossibly low voice and pointed delivery he gives weight to neutral dialogue makes inane lines sound at least passable and turns the occasional wisecrack into the wittiest thing any bald action hero has ever said. Hes got it in him to be great but if hes aiming to be the next Clint Eastwood and not the next Jean-Claude Van Damme  he needs to never make another movie like this again. The picture is a sci-fi adventure about a battle for power between a death-loving religious sect (the Necromongers) stomping through the galaxy and a much weaker amalgam of other planets. At least thats my guess. The truth is that just about everything in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is impenetrable from the convoluted story to the dark and baroque art direction. Its an inane film rendered sometimes laughable by an atmosphere of dead-serious reverence. Written and directed by David Twohy (who wrote ""The Fugitive"" -- what happened?) ""Riddick"" is apparently a sequel to Twohys low-budget sci-film ""Pitch Black"" which co-starred a pre-stardom Diesel. At pains to fill us in on the back story Twohy loads the film with absurd expository scenes in which the characters have intense discussions about things the audience knows nothing about. In one scene Riddick (Diesel) is outraged that a girl he knew has joined the Merks. But who are the Merks? A futuristic pharmaceutical company? As if to atone Twohy invariably follows such scenes with garish action sequences. So first we get a thoroughly opaque conversation between the evil Necromonger chief (Colm Feore) and Judi Dench (who plays an amorphous spiritlike entity). And then we get a scene of animatronic wolves galloping through a prison. Dont ask why. It doesnt matter. The action looks as cartoony as anything off a home computer and it all happens to the accompaniment of a pounding drum machine interspersed with the generic sound of explosions going off in a distant echo chamber. We hear this even when nothing is exploding. The only important thing to know is that the Necromonger chief known as the Lord Marshal wants to take over the universe. His mode is to invade a planet and tell everyone they must convert or die which is even more extreme than Amway. ""If you dont join us we will destroy you"" he says. Riddick himself is the last living member of a warrior race that the Lord Marshal has decimated. Though a career outlaw Riddick reluctantly answers the call to thwart the Lord Marshals plan. With considerable ambition Twohy sets out to create in ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" a full-blown mythological universe populated by characters of diverse powers and capacities. Thandie Newton is Dame Vaako a slithering Lady Macbeth wannabe who keeps urging her husband Vaako (Karl Urban) to kill the Lord Marshal and take over. Each character gets his moment but in the end Twohy is just directing traffic. His creations have no depth no humanity -- theyre like characters in a video game bouncing off one another. Twohys screenplay mixes old-fashioned slang (""Grab a gat"") with new- fashioned coarseness while putting lofty space talk in the mouths of the more genteel characters ""This is the day of days."" It is indeed the day of days when the screenwriter of ""The Fugitive"" can come up with such drivel. Only one action scene measures up when Riddick and his party race above ground toward a spaceship while the Necromongers make for the same ship in an underground tunnel. The scene capitalizes on Diesels athleticism and benefits from being light on computer effects. I also rather enjoyed the bit in which Riddick brags to a guy that he can kill him with a metal cup and then proves it but by then I was pretty starved for amusement. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence and coarse language.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Thandie Newton Vin Diesel Judi Dench or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- OK its summer. Befitting the blockbuster season Hollywood has already destroyed most of the world in ""The Day After Tomorrow."" What could be next? How about destroying a whole bunch of worlds? Thats what you get with ""The Chronicles of Riddick."" In 2000 a still-unknown Vin Diesel made a big splash in a low-budget sci-fi flick called ""Pitch Black."" Written and directed by David Twohy the movie made a lot of money so of course they had to make a sequel. This time the toy box is much bigger and Twohy pulls out all the bells and whistles that money can buy.Once again Riddick (Diesel) is a rebel without a cause reluctantly dragged into a conflict he wants nothing to do with -- though instead of just a few monsters on one planet hes facing a huge army trying to conquer a whole bunch of planets and wipe out mankind. But all you really have to know is that there is a group of very bad bad guys -- dressed to kill in form-fitting leather and metal -- who are after the good guy. And of course the good guy is the only person who can save the universe.Good talent with nothing to doWhat is unusual for a summer action flick is the talent that Diesel and Twohy were able to attract to this dubious project. Academy Award winner Judi Dench lends her formidable presence to the project as Aereon a mysterious ambassador who changes shape at will and serves as a narrator for the film. Renowned Canadian stage actor Colm Feore (""Chicago"" ""The Sum of All Fears"") plays the main villain Lord Marshall leader of the evil Necromongers and gives the role plenty of flair if not substance. And Thandie Newton (""Beloved"" ""The Truth About Charlie"") plays Vaako the ambitious wife of one of Lord Marshalls commanders. She basically serves as a lovely coat hanger modeling a series of slinky futuristic gowns while displaying tons of attitude. Judi Dench plays a mysterious ambassador in ""The Chronicles of Riddick.""Unfortunately none of these actors are able to lend any kind of real weight or legitimacy to this special effects extravaganza.Okay so the story is lame and the dialogue is trite. But thats not the point. This is a wannabe summer blockbuster so all that really matters is one question -- how does it look? It looks great. Obviously millions of dollars were poured into the amazing sets and costumes.Big cheeseGerman-born production designer Holger Gross (""Stargate"" ""Broken Arrow"") has given the sets a decidedly Teutonic look especially the Necromongers home planet. And the sets are huge. According to production notes they took up a grand total of 310000 square feet and ""Riddick"" set the record for the most lumber -- 1.5 million board feet -- ever used in Vancouver for a film. However thats probably the only record this flick will ever hold.Costume designer Ellen Mirojnick (""Face/Off"" ""The Haunting"") also pulled out all the stops dressing 300 extras and coming up with some remarkable designs for the Necromongers uniforms (not to mention the aforementioned sexy dresses for Newton). Reportedly Diesels needs were much more modest 60 black T-shirts and 50 pairs of black pants.Overall ""The Chronicles Of Riddick"" is what it is -- a big cheesy sci-fi flick tailor-made for a young male audience looking for things that go boom. Its big loud and meaningless.""The Chronicles of Riddick"" opens nationwide on Friday June 11 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

The Chronicles of Riddick Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-chronicles-of-riddick-2004,200,thechroniclesofriddick10,thechroniclesofriddick,rogerebert
"Chronicles benefits from Diesel power - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Chronicles benefits from Diesel power By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 11 2004 When last you saw Riddick it was probably about 1 a.m. and you had stumbled across an airing of 2000s ""Pitch Black"" on HBO and thought to yourself that for a cheap ""Aliens"" knockoff this was actually a pretty smart little movie. Moreover you came out of it with something approaching respect for Vin Diesel as the anti-heroic Riddick an escaped interplanetary prisoner with metallic eyes that allow him to see in the dark. The movie harnessed the actors meathead contempt for everything and everybody to a character who had a reason to feel that way instead of just copping an attitude.Both science-fiction action films and Diesels career have gone steroid in the intervening years so heres a big-budget new Riddick movie from ""Pitch Black"" writer-director David Twohy. In fact ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is being positioned as the first in what is hoped will be a series that fuses aspects of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Matrix."" The similarities dont end there.When a giant black statue head fills the screen at the very beginning of ""Chronicles"" I thought the Wachowski brothers had somehow pulled a bait-and-switch and were coming at us with ""The Matrix Regurgitated."" It turns out that the ships of the all-conquering Necromongers just look like the Wachowskis climactic Machine-God. Not coincidentally Diesel comes off as a beefier less considerate Keanu Reeves. Riddick is drafted against his will to save the universe the planet of Helion Prime the human race and the benign spirit beings known as Elementals who are represented in the film by an ethereal dowager empress named Aereon. Understanding that theres nothing like a Dame the producers have cast Judi Dench who flickers in and out of visibility as if her agent hadnt fully committed her to the role.Fans of muscular sci-fi and teenage boys of all ages will probably kick my rating up by at least a star because really ""Chronicles of Riddick"" is a perfectly acceptable entry in the summer-behemoth genre. The beetle-black CGI spaceships cross ashen skies the fight scenes are filmed with remarkable stop-time panache you could cut the pulpy comic-book doom with a plastic knife. Riddicks silvery eyes often covered with welders goggles make you less aware youre dealing with Diesel who in any event swaggers less and gets down to business more.And Twohy can direct. Initially ""Chronicles"" is a hodgepodge of ""Lord of the Rings"" ""Starship Troopers"" and the more recent ""Star Wars"" films as Riddick is brought in to fight the Necromongers on the theory that to fight evil you ""need a different kind of evil"" (or at least a really ticked off personal trainer). Helion Prime is overrun by enemy storm troopers though led by the mystical and somewhat silly Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) who can suck souls from his victims.Twohys been boning up on his George Lucas and Leni Riefenstahl but in the second act he starts trusting his impulses and the film takes off. Riddick is captured by bounty hunters led by the sleazy Toombs (Nick Chinlund) and taken to the prison planet Crematoria where sunrise kicks off temperatures of over 700 degrees. Its the inverse of ""Pitch Black"" in other words and like that film this section of ""Chronicles"" offers action with clever twists and impressively visualized dangers.Crematoria is also host to Kyra (Alexa Davalos) who was once the boyish adolescent of ""Pitch Black"" and who here becomes Riddicks increasingly unlikely love interest. Theres a prison escape some scaly pangolin/wolf beasties a run across the surface of the planet with sunrise just behind -- all good genre fun. But then we have to go back to Helion Prime and the messianic hooey needed to assure a sequel.Like everything in this humorless new genre ""Chronicles"" comes with its own snap-together mythology. Riddick turns out to be the sole survivor (maybe) of the Furians a warrior race that was obliterated after the Lord Marshal killed off their firstborn on the advice of an oracle. That either makes him Moses or Oedipus; Im not sure. Theres Shakespeare in the mix too with the Lord Marshals right-hand strongman Lord Vaako (Karl Urban of ""Lord of the Rings"" his Eomer tresses traded in for a truly hideous future-mullet) urged toward rebellion by his ambitious wife. Dame Vaako is played with high slithering camp by Thandie Newton as if Cleopatra had just returned from having her claws sharpened at a day spa.Shes also the only note of fun in this massive enterprise which is more typified by sub-""Flash Gordon"" lines like ""Take him back to the ship for mind regression"" Diesels dialogue mostly consists of dour throwdowns meant to establish his rebel credentials. Asked by Aereon if there are others like him Riddick replies ""Sister they dont know what to do with one of me."" Maybe not but boy are they trying. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Maybe its the geek association but theres something that puts sci-fi clunkers in a class of their own. ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" may not quite gain entry to the hallowed pantheon of interstellar cheese of a ""Battlefield Earth"" but its not far behind. While ""Pitch Black"" had the virtue of being moody and unpretentious this bloated over-plotted sequel is a barely comprehensible barrage of rote clashes on grim planets between wooden characters led by human boulder Vin Diesel. Cult following of the 2000 release may provide a brisk opening weekend but Universal should brace for a warp-speed dive soon after. Writer-director David Twohy infused the derivative ""Alien""-influenced story of ""Pitch Black"" with a creepy atmosphere and a fun 50s B-grade feel. While that film grossed a modest 39 million at the domestic box office it climbed steadily in stature as a video/DVD release. Given that less was more first time around in the story of a motley crew stranded on a steamy planet swarming with monstrous predators Twohys decision to switch from simplicity to bombastic overkill in a lumbering tale of sectarian domination seems especially wrongheaded. While it has none of the bizarre personality the convoluted new entry bears a passing resemblance to David Lynchs ""Dune"" in its overstuffed narrative and emotional vacuum. Theres also a vague kinship in its conclusion to the warrior savior of the Frank Herbert classic rather optimistically opening the door to another sequel. Looking like hes been to John Travoltas ""Battlefield Earth"" hairdresser Diesel returns in feral mode as Riddick the escaped convict from the planet Furyo. After shaking off a band of mercenaries led by Toombs (Nick Chinlund) he commandeers their ship and travels to Helion Prime. Riddick pauses on arrival to shear off his long matted mane and restore his gleaming dome before investigating the bounty apparently put on his head by holy man Imam (Keith David) whom he saved from death in ""Pitch Black."" But Imam needs surly Riddicks help again to escape the planets imminent invasion by the armor-clad Necromongers a half-dead army ravaging the universe to force all they encounter to embrace a single evil faith. Leading the Necro marauders is the deadly Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) who sends his commander Vaako (Karl Urban) to kill Riddick. The Lord Marshal is unaware that scheming Dame Vaako (Thandie Newton) is pushing her husband to eliminate him and seize power. Riddick who meanwhile has been taken to the hellish planet Crematoria survives some stiffly CGI-rendered reptilian dogs then re-encounters the resentful young woman previously known as Jack but now for no good reason called Kyra (Alexa Davalos) whom he saved in ""Pitch Black."" Almost invariably in overblown sci-fi epics theres a classically trained Brit on hand to grimace inwardly while wading through ludicrous dialogue and reaching for the check. This time its poor Dame Judi Dench wafting about like a windy hologram as an air-elemental being able to read the future. She sets the Lord Marshal on edge by revealing the Necro chief will die at the hand of a Furyan. While ""Pitch Black"" was a sci-fi horror movie ""Riddick"" is straight-up action fare with Diesels antihero surrounded by an unlikable gallery of characters. With his cool urban deadpan jarringly at odds with the arcane scenario Diesel makes Sylvester Stallone seem expressive. Looking spectacular in her metallic Versace-goes-galactic wardrobe Newton slinks around glaring through slitted eyes like the high priestess of bitch while Davalos just gets to thrash about angrily. New Zealander Urban creates perhaps the only semi-intriguing character. The suspense engendered in the previous pic by leaving the monsters unseen for a long stretch and the visceral shocks of some of the killings are traded here for almost unrelenting but oddly monotonous action propelled by Graeme Revells robust militaristic score. Twohy barely pauses to explore the characters relationships which is probably just as well given punchy dialogue like ""If I owned this place and hell Id rent this place out and live in hell."" Fight scenes are cut so fast theres little excitement in watching them especially the climactic face-off during which the Lord Marshals shape-shifting form reduces much of the physical conflict to a blur. The widescreen visuals and Holger Gross imposing production design and vast sets have a muscular quality that underlines Universals substantial investment in ""Riddick."" But despite the films impressive scale its the narrative hollowness thats ultimately reflected in a look which has the flattened artificial dimensionality of a videogame. Universal this month is releasing ""The Chronicles of Riddick Escape From Butcher Bay"" from its games division and ""The Chronicles of Riddick Dark Fury"" a direct-to-DVD feature from animator Peter Chung. That this movie can be expected to deliver an expanded fan base to either of these tie-ins is in a word Riddickulous.

(Related trailerSee a preview of The Chronicles of Riddick) Vin Diesel shows off his muscles in The Chronlicles of Riddick. By Joseph Lederer Universal Studios Hes supposed to be a brooding bad boy in this sequel to the cult hit Pitch Black but instead hes a vapid space thug with only his musculature to recommend him. Riddick is played by the one-note Diesel as a hunted anti-hero with translucent blue eyes that give him some kind of extra vision. Hes a former prisoner caught between warring forces in an all-galaxy mega-battle led by the powerful Necromongers (a term that apparently means someone who deals or trades in death). Any group of beings with that moniker is evil; that much is clear. But little else is. The events take place in a vague future about 500 years from now. ABOUT THE MOVIE The Chronicles of Riddick  1/2 (out of four) Stars Vin Diesel Thandie Newton Judi Dench Colm Feore Director David Twohy Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action and some language Opens Friday nationwide Riddick is assisted by an otherworldly figure played by Judi Dench. Shes an ambassador from better folks known as the Elemental race and she looks pained in the role as if she had signed on to be in a classy sci-fi thriller but then showed up on the set and immediately regretted accepting. Riddick learns about his mysterious origins (hes the last of his breed) and faces off against the leader of the Necromongers (Colm Feore) with the future of all beings hanging in the balance. Despite the precarious position of all characters involved the movies still a yawn. One asset production design. A constellation of dark corners in a galactic underworld looks forbidding. But the visuals are sometimes undercut by the frenetic action sequences. The movie is less than two hours but feels three times as long. As one watches this overheated spectacle one longs to be quickly rid of Riddick. Ick.

Its been four years since Diesel staked his claim to action stardom in that heightened B-movie ""Alien"" knockoff and its easy to chart his growth on screen By now there isnt a line of dialogue no matter how trivial that this thick-featured Gollum on roids wouldnt dare to overdo in his ""threatening"" mush-mouthed monotone. When a man becomes a swaggering action star it is generally because like Schwarzenegger or Seagal he is more or less incompetent at any other role. Diesel however made an honorable grunt in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and he had a fast-break bluster in ""Boiler Room."" Hes a paradox a tough-guy actor with a spark of true talent who is borderline incompetent at lunkish action roles. In ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" Diesel once again tries to out-basso Isaac Hayes and he treats a cheesy line like ""I bow to no man"" not by understating it - the way that say Stallone might - but by pumping it up. Hes the king of trying too hard; he turns self-adoring musclehead attitude into macho camp. The modest virtues of ""Pitch Black"" in which Diesel played the allegedly fearsome escaped convict Riddick by domesticating him enough to make him seem almost sweet are mostly obliterated by Riddick in which the returning writer-director David Twohy indulges in almost two hours of lovingly photographed hardware and mortal combat set amid the cities skies and deserts of one of those futuristic digital cosmospheres. This time Riddick the sociopathic loner who knuckles under to no one becomes a galactic gladiator facing down a brainwashing fascist with the redundant name of Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) who makes his pronouncements from within a tall burnished-silver palace that looks like it was decorated by the team of H.R. Giger and Thom Filicia. Theres one exciting moment in which Riddick and Kyra (Alexa Davalos) all grown up out of her androgynous ""Pitch Black"" disguise swing across a mountain face inches from a nuclear blast. But ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" is mostly a ponderous chronicle. Judi Dench as Marshals soothsayer shows up for just long enough to make you wonder what Judi Dench is doing in this movie and Lord Marshal himself with his high-minded talk of glory and sacrifice sounds like hes recruiting for al-Qaeda. Any allegory however is abruptly buried by Twohys fetishizing of armor and weapons. He lingers over the elegant serrated daggers and boxy machine guns as well as an ax as elaborate as a designer palm leaf; even the jutting formations on the planet where Riddick and a band of rebel mercenaries get stranded look like razor-y knives. This is a movie so devoted to metal that it couldnt care less about the flesh it destroys. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
