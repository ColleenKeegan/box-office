"Perfume Scents of horror | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPerfume Scents of horrorThe 1985 German novel Perfume The Story of a Murderer has long twitched the noses of artful obsessives since it combines the nobility of a mythic quest with horror most foul.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 5 2007 Perfume The Story of a Murderer (out of 4)Starring Ben Whishaw Dustin Hoffman Alan Rickman and Rachel Hurd-Wood. Directed by Tom Tykwer. 147 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The 1985 German novel Perfume The Story of a Murderer has long twitched the noses of artful obsessives since it combines the nobility of a mythic quest with horror most foul. The book was a bestseller across Europe which never sniffs at excess and which has also embraced this film since its autumn release overseas. In America the novel aroused rockers Kurt Cobain (via the Nirvana tune ""Scentless Apprentice"") and Marilyn Manson (the album title Smells Like Children). Cobain and Manson were fascinated by author Patrick Suskinds imagery of an odour-obsessed serial killer who possessed no scent of his own.Equally entranced was auteur director Stanley Kubrick who declared Perfume to be unfilmmable since how does one depict scents on celluloid? It was quite the admission of defeat by a man who famously turned a flying bone into a spaceship. A frustrated Suskind opted to just sit on the movie rights turning his beak up at all entreaties.Until the day some 20 years later when fellow German Tom Tykwer was finally deemed ripe for the job something that should have been obvious a decade earlier. Tykwer froze time in Run Lola Run his 1998 festival hit in which a carrot-topped sprinter defied the laws of physics. Making smells manifest on film is well within the directors alchemic grasp.As indeed he demonstrates right off the mark sending the camera flying straight up the snout of Ben Whishaws sympathetic strangler Jean-Baptiste Grenouille whom we meet as he is being sent to the gallows for heinous crimes to be revealed in flashback.The visual cues that follow as a rampaging Grenouille deeply inhales everything from the finest perfume to the most foul rotting flesh could prompt olfactory twitching in the audience. Perfumes slow transition to the screen was made more difficult still by the cost and difficulty of recreating its setting of 18th-century Paris where odours of all kinds spill into crowded streets and dingy corridors of a not-so-gay metropolis. Its here that the unlucky Grenouille is whelped by his fishmonger mother and left for dead amongst the gills and maggots before being orphaned off to the cruelest of foster homes. In these most rancid of circumstances the unfortunate urchin discovers that his nose is so acute he can identify scents down to a single molecule. Thus begins Grenouilles quest for the ultimate of whiffs something he can hold true to when all else in his life seems false.But his obsession with smells soon proves fatal to a gorgeous young fruit seller - and to others too frail to survive his intense ardour.Tykwer teamed with production designer Uli Hanisch and costume maker Pierre-Yves Gayraud to render a portrait of Paris that both delights and overwhelms the senses. This is a movie where eyes turn into noses which may run at the many ghastly sights presented.Tykwers greatest directorial feat perhaps is coaxing Dustin Hoffman into a reasonable facsimile of bewigged Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini whom a grown-up Grenouille persuades to teach him the fine art of capturing scents. A most curious casting choice - did Tykwer owe someone a favour? - Hoffman nevertheless acquits himself reasonably well including a scene in which he demonstrates quite vividly the sensual feelings that an expertly crafted perfume can arouse.Also surprising but more felicitous dramatically is the pick of the dour Alan Rickman to play merchant nobleman Antoine Richis a widower whose pride and joy is his lovely daughter Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood). She is sought by the killer with the ravenous nose.Most impressive of all is Whishaw a relatively unknown British actor who fixes Grenouille somewhere between feral child and cunning predator. Previously seen as Keith Richards in Stoned and soon to be viewed as one of several Bob Dylans in Im Not There Whishaw has a knack for making the unwashed and ill-bred seem worthy of love and sympathy.He remains so even in the films risible ending courtesy of magic realism which has to be seen - or maybe sniffed - to be believed. Like something straight out of a Fellini wet dream its as loopy a sex scene as anything since the halcyon days of the 1960s. Id say that I smell a sequel except it could prove far too pungent for censors to bear.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" with Ben Whishaw Alan Rickman Rachel Hurd-Wood Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Tom Tykwer from a screenplay by Andrew Birkin Bernd Eichinger and Tykwer based on the novel by Patrick Sskind. 160 minutes. Rated R for aberrant behavior involving nudity violence sexuality and disturbing images. Several theaters. Tom Tykwers ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" is a gloriously beautiful movie about a hideous subject an 18th-century Frenchman who murders and preserves young women in an attempt to capture their scent. He is Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) an orphan and would-be perfumer gifted with a nose that can smell everything -- except himself. Growing up in the squalor of a miserable orphanage young Jean-Baptiste realized his gift and made his lifes goal ""to possess everything the world had to offer in the way of odors."" Apprenticed to the once-fashionable perfumer Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) he learns the trade and is struck by an offhand comment Baldini makes about roses. ""They must go to their deaths"" the perfumer says cheerfully ""with their smell intact."" Such is the intoxicating story line of Patrick Suskinds sprawling 1986 novel written in language so vivid you can practically smell the pages. And Tykwer brings it to the screen with an artists flair. Both the film and the novel are true originals You watch or read breathlessly seduced by the dark beauty of the images never knowing whats coming next. And though some significant changes have been made for the screen adaptation (by Tykwer Andrew Birkin and Bernd Eichinger) including the removal of a lengthy central section the novels gloomy lyricism remains intact. Its a strange at times repellent tale of a misfit who discovers his lifes purpose upon smelling an exquisite young womans skin but its told in language that seems to float above the storys sordidness. Likewise Tykwers film (beautifully shot by director of photography Frank Griebe) surrounds us with color and contrast fields of lavender blossoms whose dusty fragrance seems to rise from the screen; the dark rainbow of infinite browns and grays that make up the streets of Paris; the glowing pearly white of a rose held by the palest of redheads. The latter is Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) the teenage daughter of a wealthy landowner (Alan Rickman the very essence of nobility) and shes so exquisite she seems unreal In a blue-green gown that contrasts with her russet hair she looks like a Rossetti painting. Jean-Baptiste by now a serial murderer becomes obsessed with her her father grows ever more determined to protect her and the story races inevitably to a showdown. Tykwer best known for the ultramodern chase movie ""Run Lola Run"" would seem an unusual choice for a period film but he infuses the sometimes stately story with vigor; though well past two and a half hours it never feels long. A few oddly modern touches -- such as Hoffmans Italian-by-way-of-Brooklyn accent -- merely serve to add flavor. By the time ""Perfume"" finds its bizarre (and yes straight from the book) conclusion you may be sorry to see it end. Its a creative and original work shining colorful light on darkness.

Voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sigourney Weaver. Directed by Paul J. Bolger. (PG. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Once upon a time in a place called Hollywood and also places called Germany Australia and Canada because little ones mo-viemaking is a global affair somebody got the idea to deconstruct Cinderella. ""Happily Never After"" is the result of what turns out to be a less than inspired notion. The best that can be said of this charmless animated picture is that whether or not it ends happily -- an outcome youre unlikely to give a hoot about -- it does happily end. The first half is told in flashback an unnecessarily complicated plot device for a movie presumably geared toward young children. Cinderellas wicked stepmother (voiced with great gusto by Sigourney Weaver one of several talented entertainers who attempt to breathe life into lines unworthy of them) begins with a harangue about the way she the big bad wolf and others of their ilk are presented in fairy tales. Shes interrupted by the narrator Rick (Freddie Prinze Jr.) who introduces himself as the guy who polishes Prince Charmings boots and flosses his teeth. Rick goes on to describe events leading up to the stepmothers tirade accompanied by extremely rudimentary animation of the Cinderella fable gone haywire because her fairy godmother and prince fail to behave in time-honored fashion. Theres an unintended laugh when after catching us up Rick announces ""I hate to tell you but it gets worse."" Unfortunately he speaks the truth as Rumpelstiltskin and the Seven Dwarfs are dragged into the sorry proceedings precipitated by the accidental upsetting of the balance between good and evil in fairy tales. Following Terry Gilliams ""The Brothers Grimm"" heres yet another grim treatment of the Grimms. Rick and Prince Charming vie for Ella (Sarah Michelle Gellar) as Cinderella is simply called. Although Rick gushes about her beauty shes really rather ugly with a bad haircut and features almost identical to her nasty stepsisters. The prince prances around sporting cleavage as if in drag. No wonder his servant thinks he has a chance with Ella. The movies animators have been quoted saying they sought to give it a classic look. Cheesy would be more accurate. Gellar and Prinze who are actually married convey chemistry through their voices. They sound as if they belong together. ""Happily Never After"" could be best experienced with your eyes shut letting the hard-working actors cast a spell with their voices that the filmmakers dont even come close to matching visually. After a great year for animation 2007 is starting out dismally with this ill-conceived mess. -- Advisory Scary images not recommended for very young children. -- Ruthe Stein Perfume The Story of a Murderer Drama. Starring Ben Whishaw Dustin Hoffman and Alan Rickman. Directed by Tom Tykwer. (R. 148 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" has an elusive appeal. It might elude everyone. Its the story of a serial killer in 18th century France driven to extremes by an overly developed sense of smell and a completely undeveloped moral nature. It shows his birth his early career and his eventual coming of age -- as a fellow going around bludgeoning young women so he can cut off their hair and capture the scent of their skin. This isnt pleasant to watch. Neither is it amusing intellectually engaging whimsically fascinating coldly satirical or painfully poignant though at any given moment in this erratic film director Tom Tykwer might be trying for one of these conflicting tones. Rather what we have here is a two hour and 28 minute movie about a repellent creep and one whos not even interesting as repellent creeps go. Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is no Bluebeard and no Norman Bates. Hes not even Rod Steiger in ""No Way to Treat a Lady."" At the center of the story is the conceit concerning Grenouilles sense of smell which at least in the movie (its based on the novel by Patrick Suskind) never achieves any allegorical significance or metaphorical clarity. Instead it regresses starting off as a curiosity and ending up as a tiresome gimmick. The films strong points are visual. France is depicted vividly as a place of filth stench and disease and Tykwers willingness to dwell on the ugliness -- Grenouilles birth onto a slop pile of a Parisian fish market is especially disgusting -- promises something different from the usual powdered-wig costume dramas. Throughout the film when it counts Tykwer finds ways for the visual to accentuate the drama. The movies best shot is of a dead body being discovered in a bright room. At first the room is too bright as if the viewers eyes need to adjust and then slowly the terrible image comes into focus. Although Tykwers visual panache is without question he has trouble with crowd scenes -- the extras look like a gathering of modern extras dirtied up and acting badly. And he cant seem to strike the right mood. He has John Hurt narrate the film in exactly the sardonic detached way that he narrated Lars von Triers ""Dogville"" but its a bad match for the story. It suggests a film in which a worthy but misunderstood protagonist finds himself in collision with a callous ridiculous world. But the story is nothing like that. Its about a monster victimizing innocent people. Why is that an occasion for sarcasm? The first hint that the movie is about to spiral out of control comes when Jean-Baptiste (Ben Whishaw) kills his first victim (by accident). What does he do? He rips off her clothes and starts sniffing her all over. In that moment he becomes even less sympathetic than the child molester in ""Little Children"" but were stuck with him. Hes our protagonist and so he remains through a dozen or so other murders which take place over the course of 2 1/2 very long hours. For as long as he is in the film Dustin Hoffman as an Italian perfume maker livens up things but his part is brief. Alan Rickman in a more substantial role brings a lot of feeling and a good sense of the era in his portrayal of a concerned father but he can save only individual scenes. The movie is lost. Finally Whishaw succeeds in making the repulsive protagonist thoroughly repulsive which is probably a testimony to his acting ability. But it doesnt make it anything worth watching. -- Advisory Multiple murders nudity perverse sexuality. -- Mick LaSalle Eating Out 2 Sloppy Seconds Comedy. Starring Jim Verraros Marco Dapper Brett Chukerman Rebekah Kochan Mink Stole. Directed by Phillip J. Bartell. (Not rated. 82 minutes. At the Castro.) With a title like ""Eating Out 2 Sloppy Seconds"" its nearly pointless to try to review it -- isnt it obvious what youre going to get? It is but here it goes anyway. A rollicking comedy for the gay niche that rarely rises above the level of a high school skit Phillip J. Bartells sequel to 2004s ""Eating Out"" is loaded with silliness and eye candy. Theres a new nude model in town and this redneck Troy (Marco Dapper) cant decide whether hes gay or straight. Kyle (""American Idol"" reject Jim Verraros) tries to win him by pretending hes straight complete with pal Tiffani (Rebekah Kochan) as his girlfriend and a membership in a gay-a-holic recovery group. Marc (Brett Chukerman) goes the traditional route -- being his openly gay self. This is a reverse of sorts of the original film in which a man pretends to be gay to get a woman. In that movie the role of Marc was played by Ryan Carnes who has since moved on to ""Desperate Housewives."" The sequel includes an over-the-top supporting role filled by John Waters favorite Mink Stole as Kyles doting mother. A big part of the allure of ""Eating Out 2"" is the fantasy of a Los Angeles where everyone is young attractive and upbeat having lots of sex but without the drama and wearing the latest designs without any visible means of support. Its a fantasy that is quickly forgotten moments after the credits roll. -- Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations and language. -- G. Allen Johnson The Aura Drama. Starring Ricardo Darin Dolores Fonzi Pablo Cedron. Directed by Fabian Bielinsky. (In Spanish with English subtitles. Not rated. 134 minutes. At the Roxie.) Seven years ago Fabian Bielinsky crafted an exquisite little crime film ""Nine Queens"" whose success owed largely to the directors loving attention to intricate detail in unfolding the story of a scam within a scam. Bielinskys latest film ""The Aura"" is in some ways more ambitious which may be one of the reasons it doesnt work as well as it should. ""The Aura"" is the story of an epileptic taxidermist who spends his days dreaming up perfect thefts he never commits and avoiding his wife. At the outset of the film he is stuffing a fox for the museum. After hes stretched the skin over the skeleton he opens a drawer filled with plastic eyes staring up at him. The scene has meaning up the yin-yang as well see later on. A fellow animal stuffer wants to take him hunting. At first the nameless taxidermist (Ricardo Darin) demurs largely because he doesnt agree with hunting. After he returns home to find his wife has left him he changes his mind. The two men wind up in the middle of a Patagonian forest staying in some ramshackle cabins owned by an older man and his significantly younger downtrodden wife. A tragic accident diverts the action into unexplored terrain and the taxidermist finds himself participating in an armored truck robbery. Bielinskys purpose here is to explore what can happen when an introvert is offered the chance to make his fantasies a reality. The careful camera work beautifully dank cinematography and the quietly nuanced performance by Darin keep our attention but in the end the films bigger challenge isnt its length or its deliberate pace Its that its overly freighted with symbolism and meaning. The idea of the taxidermist a man who stuffs dead creatures to make them seem alive is too ripe from the start. Then we have that drawer filled with blind eyes all staring up at the man as hes finishing stuffing a fox. Later the wolf-like dog of a murder victim will stare at up him the same way. The one time that taxidermist has true vision himself is right before an epileptic seizure he tells the cabin-owners wife. And of course we understand that moments of clarity are rare in his timid existence. The rest of the time he watches others live. The film which is also Argentinas Academy Awards foreign film entry this year has been gestating since 1984 when Bielinsky was a young assistant director recently out of film school. The story and focus have changed greatly since its original conception but ""The Aura"" still has a bit of film-school earnestness to it not to mention shades of by turns ""Being There"" ""Key Largo"" and ""Deliverance."" Hows that for disparate influences? -- Advisory This film contains moderate occasional violence. -- David Wiegand Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 7 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 10 Parilia Ball - San Francisco orgiastic event from almost a...

Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is intoxicated by the pheremones of a girl (Karoline Herfurth). Photo Jurgen Olczyk Dreamworks Pictures Perfume The Story of a Murderer 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Perfume The Story of a Murderer is a film that inhales and savors transgression. It concerns a perfume-obsessive sociopath a misanthropic odor savant who pursues the ideal scent with homicidal zeal. He is an artiste just as Jame Gumb in The Silence of the Lambs is an artiste exploring an outre art form within the medium of skin. His name is Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw who played Keith Richards in Stoned) and his story begins with a close-up of his nose. Hes in prison for murder likely awaiting execution a fate linked to the predilections of his prodigious snout. A nose that means business. A nose it must be stated on a mission. In flashbacks (narrated by perpetually bemused John Hurt) we learn of Grenouilles arrival in ""the most putrid spot"" of 1738 Paris where hes born under a fish stand and left for dead amid the rotting flesh. Sent to an orphanage the little fellow matures into a disaffected and nearly wordless child uninterested in the world except as a source of aroma. He discovers a cornucopia of scents leaves and grass and yellow apples and wet shoes and frogs and stones and a dead rat filled with maggots. The full extent of Grenouilles gift reveals itself one day on a jaunt into town when the young man is running an errand as a tannery apprentice. He catches wind of a market girl and follows her scent through the citys dank passages suffocating her -- accidentally -- while trying to muffle her cries. But as her body turns cold it loses its ripe whiff of femininity and hes possessed by the will to preserve (how else to say it?) the scent of a woman. Perfume is a weird brew. Directed by Run Lola Runs Tom Tom Tykwer from Patrick Suskinds hit novel (Das Parfum) its a gruesome thriller twisted into art-house fare or perhaps the reverse. Tykwer knows how to cinch a gallows noose around the viewers neck but hes working within an art form that like Grenouilles includes a few repellant ingredients. Rapturous poetic flights mingle with stomach-heaving imagery in scenes that exalt the artists commitment to his art ending with Saturnalian climax that I cant describe but might if pressed compare to Hieronymus Bosch on oysters. Acting styles range from under- (Whishaws blank canvas) to over- (Dustin Hoffman doing an unbelievably bad Italian accent as Giuseppe Baldini an over-the-hill perfumer) with a few practitioners of moderation in between (Alan Rickman as a doting father the films one true source of heartbreak). But lush visuals and lusty rhapsodic language bring Perfume as close as cinematically possible to capturing an elusive sense. All the same wheres scratch-and-sniff when you need it? Murderous effort goes into olfactory concoctions that the audience must accept on faith. ""Thats a really good perfume"" Grenouille assures Baldini but without the benefit of Smell-O-Vision the remark might as well be ""Thats a spicy a-meatball."" Later while hes busy scraping the fragrance off dead women one has cause to ponder body odor in the days before Secret. Never have I tried to imagine the distilled tang of 18th-century female corpses but morbid curiosity will do that to you. So will Tykwers film an ode to artful serial-killing that leaves a peculiar scent. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals The Mel Brooks Collection on Blu-ray for 25 + pickup at Best Buy GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

Like the scent savant in Tom Tykwers impressive and disturbing version of German author Patrick Suskinds best seller cinema does not have its own odor. Notwithstanding a few dissatisfying smell-o-rama scratch-and-sniff stunts that is. And like Grenouille ""Perfume"" takes an odd turn and becomes darker for it. Amorally creepy might be the quickest way to describe this movie about a man who kills women for their scent. Granted Grenouille is meant to vex. Though British actor Ben Whishaws animalistic portrayal owns the screen Grenouille is not exactly anti-hero. And his string of killings make it impossible to think of him as hero. When we first meet Grenouille he is about to have his head lopped off. A dirty ugly-handsome man he looks confounded even scared as guards pull him from his prison cell to quell the frenzied crowd awaiting the execution. His mother was a monger in the Paris fish market before sewers seemingly before cleanliness. Her fifth nuisance pregnancy she treats Jean-Baptistes arrival as she did the others with a squat and nary an afterthought. But the baby doesnt die. He takes a deep sniff of the world through his gifted schnoz and wails. His mother is hanged. So rich is the books language about our scented world it was difficult to imagine a movie capturing the texture of its remarkable and elusive character. (The movie appears 20 years after the novel.) Yet Tykwer and his crew make pungent work of Grenouilles world. Grenouilles birth amid the scales the entrails the heads slopped on the cobblestone should make him sympathetic. And for a while it does. We might consider his mothers death Grenouilles first (accidental) murder. His next of a young fruit seller years later sets him on a quest to capture forever scents. Once he becomes the apprentice to famed perfumer - and minor fraud - Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) his mission to be the greatest perfumer becomes even twisted. And in lush Provence Grenouille becomes the murderer of the movies title. In that bucolic setting he also becomes the faceless nemesis to Alan Rickmans nobleman Antoine Richis. Richis cannily desperately works to protect daughter Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) from becoming the killers most prized essence. As Grenouille begins to pursue his calling with craftmans ardor the movie begins to have a disquieting odor. ""Perfume"" is too well-crafted too lovely to ever stink. Yet it leaves a cloying plume.

Comments Perfume The Story of a Murderer Patrick Suskinds international best seller set in 18th-century France is sparked as well as limited by the task of conveying smell which makes it a challenge to adapt to the screen (and probably accounts for Stanley Kubricks brief interest). The abject orphaned hero (Ben Whishaw) is born with an abnormally advanced olfactory sense and ultimately leaves Paris to prey on women in the countryside killing virgins to create the ultimate perfume. Director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) and cowriters Andrew Birkin and Bernd Eichinger preserve some of the novels storytelling flair and Dustin Hoffman does a swell turn as the antiheros Italian mentor. But despite a fairly spectacular climax the materials generic limitations eventually catch up with the plot. With Alan Rickman. R 145 min.

"Perfume is a sensory overload - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Perfume is a sensory overload Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) is intoxicated by the pheromones of the plum girl (Karoline Herfurth) in ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer."" (Jurgen Olczyk/dreamworks pictures) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  January 5 2007 The first thing we see in ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" is a mans nose. It looms out of the darkness and takes a long thoughtful sniff.The nose is the movies hero. The villain is the fellow attached to it. Directed and co-written by Tom Tykwer the clever German prankster who gave us ""Run Lola Run"" ""Perfume"" is a pitch-black period epic of squalor and enterprise. Fittingly it begins with an overpowering strength that slowly dissipates over the next two and a half hours.Based on the 1985 cult novel by Patrick Suskind -- Kurt Cobain wrote a song about it and Stanley Kubrick gave up trying to turn it into a movie -- the films subject is the life times and grave misdeeds of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) an orphan raised in the worst poverty 18th-century France has to offer but whose olfactory gift is prodigious.More than prodigious. Grenouille can smell an apple being thrown at his head or a couple making love in another building. He can inhale the latest perfume and immediately break it down into its constituent parts. He smells things first finds word for them later.Because he has known nothing but cruelty from the moment of his birth his talent has no moral compass. Grenouille craves human aromas -- we learn in passing that he has none of his own -- and he pursues methods of preserving them with the dispassion of a skilled lab technician even after the bodies start piling up. Hes both Dr. Frankenstein and his monster.Indeed in many ways Tykwer has created a visionary modern remake of a 1930s Universal horror movie down to the childlike beast panicky villagers and German Expressionist shadows reaching out to suck us under. On the level of craft the film is almost evilly gorgeous to behold. Frank Griebes camera peels apart layers of Dickensian grime to find unexpected beauty. Montages of odors brilliantly edited by Alex Berner  convey Grenouilles sensory overload. Even the sound editing feels raw and revelatory.""Perfume"" takes its time and Tykwer leaves room for moments of gallows humor. Narrated by a sardonic John Hurt  the story begins with Grenouilles birth in a fish market -- a moment out of ""Monty Pythons The Meaning of Life"" -- and grimly proceeds forward from orphanage to indentured servitude to apprenticeship with a failed parfumier (Dustin Hoffman made up to look like Punchinello and very funny for his 15 minutes of screen time).Eventually our tall dark and psychotic anti hero lands in the small town of Grasse where he sets about collecting the elements of his greatest work of art. Young women begin to disappear from the streets and ""Perfume"" drolly observes the reaction of the village leaders as they waver between faith and rationality. The former is represented by a rather overplayed Bishop (David Calder ) the latter by the enlightened merchant Richis (Alan Rickman sadly intelligent as always) who has a lovely young daughter (Rachel Hurd-Wood) to protect.As astonishing as ""Perfume"" often is to watch it has a built-in limitation The main character is and remains a cipher. The 26-year-old Whishaw is a British stage up-and-comer (his ""Hamlet"" got raves at the Old Vic in 2004) and he has presence all right -- he makes Grenouille a feral and sensitive instrument. The character never develops though. His madness widens in ambition but neither deepens nor turns unexpected corners and after a while the film bumps into a wall and stops moving.Well the final scenes are unexpected -- Ill say only that Grenouilles experiments pay off in ways even he isnt prepared for -- but theyre also unbelievable even laughable. The director stays true to the source novel even when it lifts into a magical realism that works only on the page and his faithfulness betrays him. ""Perfume"" is a thriller that Hobbes might have envied with a vision of life thats nasty brutish short and alluring. In the end though Tykwer seems more interested in scents than sensibility.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

"Perfume Raising a Stink washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Perfume Raising a Stink Ben Whishaw plays a man addicted to his sense of smell in ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" with Karoline Herfurth. (By Jurgen Olczyk) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday January 5 2007 ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer""based on Patrick Suskinds 1985 bestseller works on such a high wire it ought to get points for derring-do. A big-budget spectacle by European standards (about 67 million) its set in the foulest regions of 18th-century Paris features gruesome killings and asks audiences to become acquainted with the finer details of perfume extraction. So its simultaneously arty arcane and nasty. It follows the misadventures of a man-child whos keenly attuned and addicted to his sense of smell. The extra wrinkle is Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (newcomer Ben Whishaw) is so determined to extract the ultimate scent -- the one he remembers from his first and only love -- he resorts to serial murder to reproduce it. ""Perfume"" featuring the gravelly narration of John Hurt has its moments particularly as a visual experience. The squalor of slums the glitz of high-society gowns and the gorgeous countryside of southern France for instance take you to another time. But the film is an uneven experience. Fans of the book will appreciate its earnest attempts to capture much of the novels details spirit and texture. But most will see director Tom Tykwers failure to find the tonal balance that reprises the novels arch irony and that makes us appreciate Jean-Baptistes olfactory sensibilities despite his heartless serial killing. And few will applaud Dustin Hoffmans annoying performance as an Italian perfumer. Theres also the matter of evoking Jean-Baptistes sense of smell in a medium made for sight and sound. Tykwer best known for his fabulously kinetic ""Run Lola Run"" has no choice but to convey it visually. Thus we are forever shooting in and out of nostrils then cutting to extreme close-ups of whatevers being smelled a luscious virginal girl or the writhing maggots inside a dead rat. After a while good readers we got nose-cammed out. -- Desson Thomson Perfume The Story of a MurdererR 148 minutesContains overall intensity mature themes violence nudity and profanity. Area theaters.

In Perfume a coolly sensuous adaptation of Patrick Suskinds terrific 1986 international best-seller the young British actor Ben Whishaw offers a potent translation of smell and its effect. Playing Jean-Baptiste a near-feral orphan in stinking 18th-century France who is blessed but mostly cursed with a supernaturally sensitive nose Whishaw somehow gives his entire begrimed sinewy body over to the thrall of sniffing. The first time he inhales the aroma of a beautiful young girl the experience is orgasmic enough to become an obsession and its clear hes destined to become the worlds greatest perfumer -- never mind that his preservation of natural fragrance involves murder. (J-Bs teacher in odoriferous arts is played with amusement and rouge by Dustin Hoffman.) Tom Tykwer the inventive German director of Run Lola Run is a spicy match for the erotically charged novel. He makes effective use of images sliced thin as transparent garlic slivers to convey sensual buildup. And he conjures up a great fleshly be-in as aroused townsfolk get a whiff of J-Bs infernally perfected fragrance. Perfume misses some of the subtler base notes of Suskinds creepier more self-aware original but Whishaw and Tykwer blend the movie into something quite heady in its own bottle.

Tom Tykwers answer dont bother and indulge in other sensory pleasures instead. His and Andrew Birkins adaptation of Patrick Suskinds novel chronicling the olfactory perversions of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille a fictional serial killer in pre-revolutionary France with a particular nose for young women (who here all look like Calvin Klein models) offers obvious obstacles to any filmmaker. Bar rare experiments in smellovision such as the Odorama scratch-and-sniff cards John Waters created for Polyester (1981) cinema doesnt offer much to the humble pecker preferring instead its close neighbours the ears and eyes from which Tykwer demands full attention even if he leaves a jealous brain demanding more.Tykwer manages to send a tingle up the spine from the off when Grenouilles mother gives birth to her unwanted boy among the stinking entrails of a Parisian fish market. He has us squirming at the sights and sounds of this living hell just as he dives straight into the visual horror of the years that Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) spends living in an orphanage and working at a tannery. Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic deliver a rousing score (to which Tykwer himself contributed) but not even that can save a saggy middle section when we cant help but tire a little of all the murder and beauty. One of the films last hurrahs takes the word baroque to a higher plain as we witness a mass public orgy which can only be described as the marriage between the desert sex scene in Zabriskie Point and the nude public photographs of Spencer Tunick. Its a film so sumptuous that afterwards youll feel youve consumed a very very rich meal indeed.

But it is. Thats the secret at the center of Guillermo del Toros magnificent Spanish-language film which interweaves the girls gothic imaginings and the life shes forced to live in a remote Spanish military outpost in the 1940s when Francos troops have all but crushed the Loyalist resistance. Ofelia has an evil stepfather the outposts commander Captain Vidal. Her inner and outer worlds are populated by monsters including the fey faun of the title. Both worlds demand unquestioning obedience force her to decide on sketchy evidence who can or cant be trusted and require more courage than she may possess. ENLARGE Last week I put ""Pans Labyrinth"" on my list of the years 10 best films and marveled albeit briefly at its dark enchantments. Now its time to marvel in some detail at the wizardry of Mr. del Toro and at the somber beauty of his new film in which Ofelia is played by a remarkable young Spanish actress named Ivana Baquero. (I loved one scene among many good ones in which she takes on a monstrous toad that in the fashion of Francos forces draining life from the nation is draining all energy from a giant fig tree.) The director who is known for such stylish horror flicks as ""Cronos"" ""Mimic"" and ""Hellboy"" is part of a triumvirate of brilliant Mexican filmmakers that includes Alejandro Gonzales Inarritu and Alfonso Cuaron. In ""Pans Labyrinth"" Mr. del Toro returns to a theme he first addressed five years ago with ""The Devils Backbone."" In that film which pretty much followed the rules of the horror genre echoes of the Spanish civil war resonate within the walled confines of an orphanage. This time however the fantasy elements -- enhanced by the judicious yet spectacular use of digital effects -- transcend conventional horror though as children discover and adults forget horror is a basic ingredient of classic fairy tales. By doing so they amplify the evil conveyed by Sergi Lopezs stunning performance as the fascist commander. The result of the intricate interplay is a fairy tale for adults that is violent sometimes shocking yet utterly engrossing. And eerily instructive; it deepens our emotional understanding of fascism and of rigid ideologys dire consequences. ENLARGE Ivana Baquero plays a girl forced to live in a remote military outpost in Pans Labyrinth Theres a sense of all elements coming together here for Guillermo del Toro and his colleagues the splendid Mexican cinematographer Guillermo Navarro who has worked with him before; the production designer Eugenio Caballero; the sound designer Martin Hernandez; Doug Jones another veteran of del Toro films who plays both the faun and the Pale Man; and Javier Navarette who wrote the original music. Ofelias only human confidante a servant named Mercedes is played by Maribel Verdu who was the lovely mercurial Luisa in ""Y Tu Mama Tambien."" Once again her beauty is touching but Luisas mercury has been replaced by Mercedess tempered steel. Notes on a Scandal"" The two London teachers played with glorious gusto by Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett in ""Notes on a Scandal"" are lonelier than life which can get very lonely. Theyre also bigger than life and lots more vivid in their obsessions. Dame Judi is Barbara Covett a stern soul in a frumpy body and a closet lesbian whose closest companion is Portia her cat until her secondary school hires a new art teacher Ms. Blanchetts Sheba Hart. The unhappily married Sheba is a troubled soul in a preposterously gorgeous body which shes soon baring and eagerly giving to a fifteen-year-old student named Steven. (Hes played by Andrew Simpson and wears a callow smirk.) Parallel obsessions then Shebas heedless passion for her student and Barbaras mad fixation on Sheba which grows ever madder after Barbara discovers Shebas criminal dalliance with an under-age partner. The question posed by the movie with ever greater shrillness is whose behavior is more predatory. ENLARGE Ben Wishaw and Karoline Herfurth in Perfume ""Notes on a Scandal"" was directed by Richard Eyre a man of the theater who obviously adores actors and acting and adapted by the playwright Patrick Marber from Zoe Hellers celebrated novel. I was resistant to the broadband misanthropy of Mr. Marbers ""Closer"" and hes at it again; taken at face value these two women are simply despicable. But the screenplay has a bracing tincture of Grand Guignol and nothing is simple when the two women are played by a couple of superlative actresses who clearly delight in one another. Cate Blanchett shot like a visiting angel by the masterful cinematographer Chris Menges lights Shebas transgressions with a flame-throwers fire while Judi Dench takes Barbara beyond ""Fatal Attraction"" into new realms of crinkle-eyed cruelty. And makes her solitude convincingly toxic in the bargain. Perfume The Story of a Murderer ""Perfume The Story of a Murderer"" weaves a sensual spell of extraordinary delicacy then sustains it -- up to a point. Tom Tykwers elaborate film version of the Patrick Suskind novel concerns an orphan Jean-Baptiste Grenouille who is born in the streets of 18th Century Paris with a singular gift -- a preternaturally acute sense of smell. When Grenouille grows up and discovers the wonders of perfume he becomes a serial killer -- a sort of Jack the Sniffer -- who murders women not out of any overt sexual urge but because he seeks to capture their essence in a literal eau de femme. Mr. Tykwer is a director of distinction -- his films include ""Run Lola Run"" ""The Princess and the Warrior"" and ""Heaven"" (which was distinguished by Cate Blanchetts formidable performance.) His work in ""Perfume"" is audacious often elegant and the films strong cast includes Alan Rickman Rachel Hurd-Wood Dustin Hoffman doing an amusing turn as a Parisian perfumer and Ben Wishaw as Grenouille whose spectacular rise and epic fall suggest the trajectory of an anti-Christ. Once youve seen ""Perfume"" youre unlikely to forget it. But once the movie broke its spell and the story turned silly -- ""Perfume"" is very long -- I found myself thinking not of elixirs or even pheromones but of Jimmy Durante who would point to his fabled schnozzola and say gleefully ""The nose knows."" Children of Men ENLARGE Clive Owen in Children of Men Seldom does a film convey as stark and riveting a vision as the one that unfolds in ""Children of Men"" a dystopian drama starring Clive Owen and directed by Alfonso Cuaron. (The cinematographer was Emmanuel Lubezki and the production was designed brilliantly by Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland.) And seldom are the director his actors and their audience sandbagged by a script of such ineptitude. The time is 2027 and the place is England but an England that has become an armed camp of terrorist bands and unrelieved bleakness where fascist police hold hordes of illegal immigrants in giant cages. ""The world has collapsed"" a voice intones on TV. ""Only Britain soldiers on."" The cause of the collapse is clear and apparently intractable -- world-wide infertility and loss of hope; no baby has been born for 18 years. Then almost miraculously a pregnant young woman appears and its the task of Clive Owens Theo a former radical turned morose bureaucrat to shepherd her to the sanctuary of a waiting ship owned by a shadowy -- but good-shadowy -- group called The Human Project. Well never know if their mythic quest might have made an accessible movie for this one offers characters as bleak as its setting -- the sole exception being Michael Caine in a role one size larger than a cameo -- and makes a murky cipher of the plot. What is going on in all those shadows? Whats supposed to happen once Theo and his fertile charge reach the ship? The bloated adaptation of P.D. Jamess thoughtful compact novel is credited if you can call it that to five writers. They were too many or too few. DVD TIP In ""An Affair of Love"" (1999) a French-language film that identifies its lovers only as Him and Her Sergi Lopezs charming young Spaniard answers a personals ad placed by an older French woman played by Nathalie Baye who proposes ""une affaire pornographique"" (which was the original title). Please jump to no conclusions. The affair is anything but pornographic and the movie directed by Frederic Fonteyne from a script by Philippe Blasband is an unexpected delight.

"Perfume The Story of a Murderer | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; perfume-the-story-of-a-murderer ) Perfume The Story of a Murderer (Germany/France/Spain 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Perfume The Story of a Murderer is beautiful in its ugliness. Among other things it features gorgeously composed scenes of maggots animal entrails and human corpses. And in direct contrast to Marie Antoinette it portrays 18th century France is a grimy dirty place regardless of whether the location is Paris or Grasse. Certainly Tom Tykwers latest film is audacious but audaciousness does not necessarily equate to worthwhile cinema. Theres a mesmerizing appeal to the directors in-your-face style even if the images he displays are often repugnant. Unfortunately Tykwer is working with a flawed screenplay and even the most arresting visuals cannot compensate for the movies schizophrenic story. Perfume is the tale of the fictitious Jean-Baptiste Genouille (Ben Wishaw) a perfume maker who lives during the mid-1700s in France. Blessed with an acute almost superhuman sense of smell he begins his career by developing some of the most sought after perfumes while working as the apprentice to a Parisian salesman Guiseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman). When his ultimate desire to distill the essence of the human odor can not be achieved under Baldini he quits Paris for Grasse where he discovers the solution to his dilemma murder. He finds that by killing young girls slathering them in animal fat allowing them to stew briefly while tightly wrapped then removing the fat he can capture the human essence. For his ultimate perfume he needs thirteen such components which means thirteen deaths. The last of these is intended to be Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) the most beautiful girl in Grasse and the daughter of the powerful and influential Richis (Alan Rickman). For about two-thirds of its lengthy running time (nearly 2 1/2 hours) Perfume is an offbeat period piece/character study giving viewers insight into the workings of the demented mind of a serial killer. British actor Ben Wishaw in his first major international role is effective drawing us into the murderers sphere encouraging understanding (although not sympathy). Jean-Baptiste is creepy and uncharismatic and Wishaw plays him as both. His predatory nature is non-sexual. Even though all his victims are found nude they remain virgins (except those who would not ordinarily be such as a prostitute). The metaphor for sex is the theft of the girls essences. Jean-Baptistes crimes are rape and murder although his raping occurs not through penetration but through distillation. However about 110 minutes into the movie everything changes and Perfume turns into an unsubtle Jesus allegory. All the elements are in place the cross the resurrection the outpouring of love and the ascension. The shift in tone is so extreme and unexpected that it creates a disconnect with what precedes it. Although one would never call Perfumes first two-thirds subtle they are restrained compared to what Tykwer does during the third act. Perfume features two high-profile actors. The first Dustin Hoffman is out-of-place. Hoffman is the consummate professional and gives it a game try but he is miscast as Baldini and the performance rarely rings true. Alan Rickman on the other hand is exceptional. Unfortunately his role lacks prominence. The balance of the supporting roles are filled by British character actors. (Tykwers decision to shoot this in English for international marketing reasons limits his casting choices.) Tykwers career has been marked by daring choices some of which work better than others. Run Lola Run was an infusion of pure energy. The Princess and the Warrior was a powerful offbeat fable. Now Perfume takes Tykwer in a darker direction. Although the films most fascinating element - the quest for perfection by a sociopath who uses murder as a regrettable tool - is abandoned during the final act it is an absorbing albeit unsettling topic for a motion picture to attack. Tykwers approach invigorates the material providing a provocative collage of images that will have some viewers turning away and others wishing they had deferred their most recent meal. Deeply flawed though it may be Perfume is a challenging motion picture and one whose impressions are not easily shaken.

The seductive sensory prose of Patrick Suskinds bestseller ""Perfume"" reaches the screen with loads of visual panache but only intermittent magic in producer Bernd Eichinger and helmer Tom Tykwers long-awaited pic version. In many respects its too faithful to the 1985 novel an almost impossible to adapt reportage-cum-reverie written from an ironic modern viewpoint about an 18th century Parisian orphan who turns mass murderer in search of the perfect scent Love. Euro big-budgeter shot in English on a reported tab of E50 million (63.7 million) has a readymade fan base especially in Europe among the books 15 million readers but is more high-end fare in Anglo markets. Released Sept. 14 in Germany where its well on its way to hitting a hunky 3 million admissions in its first month pic has already started its three-month rollout across most of the rest of Europe. First test in an Anglophone territory will be Blighty on Dec. 8; Stateside release is skedded for Dec. 27. Suskind a reclusive Munich writer refused to sell the screen rights for many years finally yielding to Eichingers repeated requests in 2001. (In the meantime Suskind had co-written the superb ensembler ""Rossini"" which Eichingers Constantin Film distribbed in 1997.) British writer-director Andrew Birkin worked first with Eichinger on the script and they were then joined by Tykwer (""Run Lola Run"") who finally took over the helming reins. Tykwer seems the ideal choice having shown a grasp for contempo magic realism and highly metaphysical material in earlier pics like Expressionistic psychothriller ""Deadly Maria"" (1993) and Cate Blanchett starrer ""Heaven"" (2002) Tykwers most recent feature. Problem with ""Perfume"" is not so much how to make the audience identify with a largely silent olfactory-obsessed nerd who turns serial killer but how to transmit his compulsion in the strictly audiovisual medium of film. (AromaRama and Smell-O-Vision which dispensed odors into theaters died a quick death in 1959-60.) Tykwers early solution -- paralleling Suskinds stench-heavy opening prose -- is to lay on the visual grunge of 18th century Paris. After an opening in 1766 showing Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw) being led to hear his death sentence read to a braying crowd pic flashes back 22 years. We see his birth in a stinking fish market his childhood in an orphanage run by the money-grabbing Mme. Gaillard (Sian Thomas) and his apprenticeship in a filthy tannery under thug-with-boils Grimal (Sam Douglas). Parallel with this visual onslaught an offscreen narrator (an excellent John Hurt in the English version; veteran thesp Otto Sander in German prints) preserves some of Suskinds irony as he describes Grenouilles growing obsession with ""the fleeting world of scent."" His olfactory sense becomes so highly tuned that it nullifies all other human qualities including love compassion and personal communication. More than just a killer-thriller or the tale of a man with an exceptional gift ""Perfume"" is a skewed love story of a man who suddenly discovers the ""scent of woman"" but cant make the jump into real relationships. Wandering in nighttime Paris Grenouille catches the scent of a young woman selling plums (Karoline Herfurth). Almost accidentally he strangles her and then in one of the films most powerful sequences tries to preserve her bodily scent in his memory by sniffing her naked corpse. Grenouilles opportunity to develop his obsession comes in the form of onetime successful parfumier Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman) whom he persuades to take him on as an apprentice. When Grenouille discovers that human scent cant be bottled he sets out on his own to Provence in southern France -- to the town of Grasse which specializes in enfleurage extracting the essence of flowers. Joining a firm run by Mme. Arnulfi (German thesp Corinna Harfouch) and becoming obsessed by the virginal scent of local beauty Laura (newcomer Rachel Hurd-Wood) daughter of widowed merchant Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) he turns to mass murder to produce the ultimate femme-scent cocktail. Apart from scissoring an episode set in Montpellier script is extremely faithful to Suskinds book -- indeed more liberties should have been taken to make the novel work on the screen. During its first hour prior to Provence film is entertaining on a visual level with Uli Hanischs extraordinary production design and Pierre-Yves Gayrauds lived-in costumes giving a real feel for 18th century Paris without too much exaggeration. But with far too big a chunk of screentime given to Hoffmans unconvincing perf as the charlatan Baldini pic is slow moving . Despite Hurts toney voiceover and all the shots of Grenouilles twitching nose and talk of scent manufacture theres a limit to how well any film can convey the protags sensory dilemma. Film really gets under way in the Grasse half with the brighter more colorful vistas and Grenouille finally deciding to show the world hes not a nobody. With Rickman proving a classy combatant as a father seeking to protect his only child picture starts to grip in human terms. Only during the yarns final segment which plays OK in the book but looks daft onscreen does ""Perfume"" really lose its bouquet. Major kudos go to 25-year-old Whishaw recently seen as Keith Richards in ""Stoned"" for his half-angel half-devil perf as Grenouille a difficult role into which the young British thesp throws himself with conviction. Among the many fine supports Harfouch seems shortchanged in a part that seems to have suffered from cuts. Though it may offend enthusiasts of the original tightening throughout by some 20 minutes would improve the movie dramatically. But even in its present form pic is still like the novel an extraordinarily brave challenging piece of work. If Tykwer amp; Co. had cut loose a bit more and gone for the heart rather than the intellect ""Perfume"" could have been a fragrant treat indeed.
