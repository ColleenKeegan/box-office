Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com6/25/2015 Editor rating 2.5 The clue is right there in the title The most important element of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is not the young woman with leukemia. Nor is it sidekick Earl even though his enigmatic character presents quite a few interesting possibilities. No the focus is ""Me"" floppy-haired teen narrator Greg whose social awkwardness is presented as the real crux of this tragicomedy. Adapted by Jesse Andrews who wrote the novel on which the movie is based Me and Earl and the Dying Girl arrives with a bit of cinematic fanfare It won the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. Understanding why is not hard. The movie directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (most notable for directing episodes of American Horror Story and Glee) is full of the quirky touches Sundance audiences admire amusing flights of fancy involving animation; offbeat characters like Gregs dad (Nick Offerman of Parks and Recreation) a professor who wanders around in a robe slurping down bizarre food; cute title cards before each major scene (""The Part Where I Meet a Dying Girl"" ""Day 1 of Doomed Friendship""). Theres plenty to like here but the movie focuses on the least interesting person on the screen a curious choice considering were talking life and death. Greg (Thomas Mann of Project X) is a smart if unassuming senior in Pittsburgh where he negotiates the tribal pathways of high school by being a casual friend to kids from every clique without bonding with any of them. The one exception is Earl (RJ Cyler) from the tough part of town (translation hes African American). Greg and Earl have known each other since they were little kids. They have made a series of short movie parodies based on the classics they love (A Clockwork Orange becomes A Sockwork Orange acted out via gym socks with googly eyes as Droogs for example). But Greg still refers to Earl as his co-worker unable to call him a ""friend"" because -- well because thats the movies construct. Greg is afraid to have friends. When his classmate Rachel (Olivia Cooke Bates Motel) is diagnosed with leukemia Gregs mother (Connie Britton) insists he spend time with the girl even though theyve never been particular friends. Why is never fully explained although supposedly Gregs mom is friends with Rachels mom (Molly Shannon stuck in an awful borderline predatory older-woman part and making the worst of it). Gregs oddball sense of humor his mother says is just what Rachel needs. So the two become friends as we see via montage. But when Greg and Earl try to make a movie for Rachel whose health begins to falter things start to fall apart. The film founders at that point all its carefully constructed eccentricity not enough to overcome the unnerving feeling that were wasting time with the wrong person. We learn almost nothing about Rachel beyond her illness until the film is almost over; she exists as a catalyst for Greg to solve his social anxiety. The laconic Earl is another wasted opportunity The moments in which he talks to Rachel are among the films most simple and moving but hes relegated to the outskirts of Gregs preoccupations (Earl also has an older brother who may as well be called Stereotype since all he does is sit around smoking and shouting threats pit bull by his side). Even Gregs tattooed and charismatic history teacher (Jon Bernthal) is more interesting than the self-absorbed kid were supposed to care about. The obvious comparison is the film adaptation of John Greens The Fault in Our Stars the tearjerker about two teenagers with cancer who fall in love. That movie is an unabashed melodrama that aims straight for the tear ducts. Why then does it feel more authentic than Me and Earl and the Dying Girl? Maybe because the focus is in the right place the emotions are tangible enough to grapple with and were not asked to grieve for a boy with his whole life ahead of him.

Instead he spends endless hours with his equally solitary ""co-worker"" Earl (RJ Cyler) reimagining art-house-cinema classics with pun-drunk titles--A Sockwork Orange Death in Tennis--and pocket-lint production values. The teenage-Truffaut act is working out fairly well for him until the day his mother (Connie Britton lovely but underused) pushes him to reach out to a cancer-stricken classmate he hardly knows. Rachel (Olivia Cooke) isnt psyched either; shes uninterested in pity and initially as wary as he is. But they both need to connect more than they need to stay cool and a friendship blooms. The movie adapted by Jesse Andrews from his own award-winning YA novel took home a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance earlier this year. So its not entirely surprising that its preternaturally wise Pussy Riot-referencing kids and kooky adults (including Molly Shannon Nick Offerman and The Walking Deads Jon Bernthal) can feel less like real people than like a canny writers audience-courting inventions. Andrews brand of adorkability is an acquired taste and a hurdle that viewers with a low tolerance for twee--you either have the Juno gene or you dont--probably wont clear. But somewhere along the way Earl eases up on the suburban-Wes Anderson whimsy and starts to find its heart infusing the storys self-conscious cleverness and trick-shot set pieces with something sweeter sadder and even a little bit profound. In other words it grows up.

Movies that explore the treacherous process of growing up are a dime a dozen but few recent efforts encapsulate the layered fears that accompany the coming of age experience with as much wit and depth as Alfonso Gomez-Rejons ""Me Earl and the Dying Girl."" For 17-year-old Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) being social is more stressful than satisfying his immense self-consciousness crushing any desire to form lasting relationships. His sole companion is his coworker Earl (RJ Cyler) with whom hes been making whimsical adaptations of classic films since childhood with titles like ""49th Parallelogram"" and ""Its a Punderful Life."" While Greg just wants to make it through his senior year as inconspicuously as possible his mother soon tramples on his plans to maintain a friendly distance when she insists that he spend time with Rachel a classmate recently diagnosed with leukemia. He reluctantly agrees and a grudging clumsy first encounter quickly blossoms into a relationship that he never imagined he could participate in. Sparkling with smart humor brutal honesty and imaginative cinematography that includes constant visual surprises ""Earl"" is not your stereotypical maudlin young adult romance --in fact that angle is deliberately underplayed with Greg reminding us at regular intervals that this isnt a ""sappy love story."" That may be true but the characters are too lovable not to be infectious. Virtually squirming in his own skin Gregs teen conundrums are universally relatable and Mann infuses his neuroses with endearing honesty. While Gregs self-deprecating tendencies need a boost of confidence theyre a welcome distraction for Rachel who could use a few laughs to take her mind off her dim prognosis. But Gomez-Rejons profound grasp of Jesse Andrews multi-dimensional screenplay ensures that ""Me and Earl"" doesnt snowball into a pity party. As Rachel tests Greg in ways hes never been stretched and pushes him to confront realities he has determinedly avoided so far he stands to gain the most from their interactions. Their relationship goes beyond simple friendship or sexual chemistry -- the first real connection Greg has made that doesnt rely on his usual defense mechanisms. ""Quirkiness"" that increasingly common trait to films catered to young adults can often feel like a superfluous frill. But here its an effective storytelling tool. Narrated from the perspective of a social hermit like Greg whose modes of self-expression are unfiltered one minute and heavily-censored the next a straightforwardness narrative would seem out of place. Spurts of appropriately-timed animation chapters titles like ""The Part Where I Panic Out of Sheer Awkwardness"" and innovative camerawork by ""Oldboy"" cinematographer Chung-Hoon Chung -- which lurches erratically to right-angled perspectives -- only heighten the visual extension of Gregs multi-dimensional teen psyche. But none of the stylistic flourishes would work if not for the spectacular cast whose sincere performances imbue the screenplay with authenticity despite its eccentricities. The three leads approach their roles with rare maturity juggling comic timing with sensitivity for the more somber elements without missing a beat; Cyler in particular stands out as Earl Gregs creative wingman and voice of reason often serving as a simultaneous slap-in-the-face and grounding force during Gregs reflexive retreats into isolation. There is no doubt that ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" will hold major commercial potential post-Sundance. But dont let the numbers game steal the focus from the real takeaway Poignant without being melodramatic overflowing with unforced charm ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" holds a unique appeal thats certain to last. Grade A ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" premiered last week at the Sundance Film Festival. Fox Searchlight will release the film later this year.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Jun 12 2015 Film The biggest flaw in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is right there in the title the first word specifically. Alfonso Gomez-Rejons Sundance-winning coming-of-age drama is rife with meta-textual ambition featuring a fourth wall-breaking narrator rapid cuts to stop-motion animation set design so attentive to detail that it evokes Wes Anderson and a teen-with-cancer plot that largely manages to skirt cliche. Which makes it all the more frustrating that it filters all of this through the point of view of a bland self-centered protagonist whose personal growth makes up the narrative arc of the film while simultaneously being the least interesting thing about it.Related Story The Fault in Our Stars A Betrayal The ""me"" of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is Greg (Thomas Mann) a gawky high school senior in Pittsburgh who narrates his story to the audience with irritating self-awareness essaying a breakdown of his schools jocks/geeks/stoners sub-cultures as if it isnt territory thats been covered in a thousand other films. Greg cultivates his invisibility in the school proudly an acquaintance to all and an enemy to none and spends most of his time in a history teachers office watching art films with his friend Earl (RJ Cyler) who helps him make silly but thoughtful movie parodies that have names like My Dinner with Andre the Giant or A Sockwork Orange. When his mother (Connie Britton) hears that a classmate of Gregs has been diagnosed with leukemia she nudges him into spending time with her kindling a friendship that Gregs voice-over constantly reminds us is doomed.Both Earl and the cancer-stricken Rachel (Olivia Cooke) would serve as far more involving protagonists than Greg. Relegated to the sidelines the young actors deliver rather spellbinding performances though theyre limited by their dull narrative purpose. Earl is sometimes Gregs comically blunt sidekick (hes African American and supposedly from a ""bad part of town"" that consists of two ramshackle shotgun houses) and at other times a wise sage beyond his years; Rachel has a doomed sort of maturity watching sadly but empathetically as the people around her struggle with her tragic diagnosis.In the middle is the annoyingly precocious Greg. His parents are gently encouraging oddballs (his dad played by Nick Offerman putters around the house cooking adventurous ethnic foods) hes blessed with unique artistic talent (the quirky films he makes with Earl are lovingly rendered on screen as earthy gobs of genius by Gomez-Rejon) and hes innately funny and charming. So of course he spends the whole film complaining about what a boring nonentity he is and how detached he feels from everyone needing the shock of his friend dying of cancer to finally push him into adulthood.The biggest flaw in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is right there in the title the first word specifically. This is what keeps Me and Earl from ever feeling particularly authentic or weighty. Far soapier teen dramas along similar lines like last years The Fault in Our Stars might suffer from brutally obvious symbolism and sudden plot twists but they also value their lead characters as equals. Rachel is lovingly performed by Cooke but exists mostly to nudge Greg toward his own personal realizations. Screenwriter Jesse Andrews who adapted his 2012 novel gives viewers plenty of evidence to recognize Georges big heart and his personal flaws but doesnt let Greg himself discover them until the end of the film.Still this is a drama about a young girl with cancer and its final act is designed to hit viewers hard. Gomez-Rejon (a longtime second-unit director who made his feature debut last year with The Town That Dreaded Sundown) shows off way too much in the films first hour filling the frame with tons of overtly clever details and busily moving his camera around to no real end. His meticulous compositions have drawn many comparisons to Wes Anderson but Me and Earls kinetic filming of perfunctory high-school hustle and bustle evokes Richard Kellys work on Donnie Darko (another Sundance favorite many moons ago) while lacking that films supernatural edge. Its a relief when Gomez-Rejon settles down a little for the films more somber closing scenes which help reflect Gregs growing maturity in the face of Rachels advancing illness.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is both helped and hindered by its status as a Sundance darling--its hard to walk into a much-hyped drama about a teenage girl with cancer expecting it to reinvent the wheel. There are only so many ways to tell this story and despite the self-aware voice-over and multiple films-within-a-film theres little to Me and Earls plot that hasnt been seen before even if it handles its final moments much more deftly than its peers. Gregs personal evolution closes on a powerful note that helps rescue the film from being formulaic; but its still a shame that its Gregs story first and foremost that the film chooses to tell.

""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

First off the ""Dying Girl"" bit -- didnt we just go through this and five boxes of tissues with last years ""The Fault in Our Stars""? And then theres the supporting characters -- an overly tattooed teacher (Jon Bernthal) a pigfoot-eating dad (Nick Offerman) a boozy flirty mom (Molly Shannon). Its like someone just wrote ""insert quirky indie film character.""Worse this is yet another movie about making movies. Talk about being self-involved moviemakers.Yet it works (OK the quirky characters are a bit much) mostly because of its fine young cast and the steady hand of director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (""Glee"" ""American Horror Story""). You believe enough in these kids and hope enough for them to buy it.Standing center is Greg (Thomas Mann) the kind of high school kid who breezes through life without allowing himself to connect with anyone. His only real friend (although hed never use that word) is Earl (RJ Cyler) a black kid from the poor side of town. For years theyve been making art film parodies with titles like ""A Sockwork Orange"" and ""Eyes Wide Butt"" films Greg derides but which are actually ingenious.Then one day Gregs mother (Connie Britton) tells him a classmate he hardly knows Rachel (Olivia Cooke) has cancer and she pushes him to visit her. Which he does and although shes initially wary of being pitied a friendship of loners blooms. So Greg and Earl set out to make a movie for Rachel.And what a movie. In making something real and facing something real Greg finally learns to get real.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongMe and Earl and the Dying GirlGRADE BRated PG-3 for sexual content drug material language and some thematic elementsRunning time 105 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Nh1Cfr MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/25/movie-review-smarts-sweetness-overcome-quirks-indie-earl-dying-girl/29298463/,200,meandearlandthedyinggirl6,meandearlandthedyinggirl,detroitnews

Anne Marie Fox Olivia Cooke (left) and Thomas Mannin ""Me and Earl and The Dying Girl."" (Anne Marie Fox/Fox Searchlight Pictures via AP) Anne Marie Fox (From left) Thomas Mann Nick Offerman and Connie Britton in ""Me and Earl and The Dying Girl."" (Anne Marie Fox/Fox Searchlight Pictures via AP) Greg (Thomas Mann) is a high school senior whod rather not face the prospect of going to the prom. Some people might call him a nerd but that description doesnt quite fit. A nerd must struggle to fit in socially but Greg has figured out a way to circumvent the system by transforming himself into something of a ghost making his way from class to class without significantly connecting with any particular clique. And for the most part he likes it that way.His only friend -- whom he insists on referring to as a ""co-worker"" -- is Earl (RJ Cyler) who shares his love of cinema. The two collaborate on short parodies of classic films (with titles such as ""My Dinner with Andre the Giant"" and ""The Janitor of Oz"") that they keep secret from their classmates.Greg is forced out of his bubble when his mom (Connie Britton) insists that he hang out with Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who has been diagnosed with leukemia. At first Rachel is no more enthusiastic about the idea than Greg is. But she quickly responds to his offbeat sense of humor and finds that hes just the kind of friend she needs. As things progress that friendship begins to look more and more like a romance. Rachel even gets Greg to apply to college which he had been reluctant to do because he envisioned it as an even more horrible extension of high school. But her illness lingers.In his role as the films narrator Greg assures us that its not a romance and that we shouldnt expect the usual cliches. Whether hes being candid about his connection with Rachel is debatable. But hes definitely right about the breathtaking originality of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" Based on the novel by Jesse Andrews its a wonderful film about being young talented and uncertain about what lies ahead. Working from a screenplay by Andrews director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon deftly balances comedy and drama to create a coming-of-age story that ventures into dark places without succumbing to sentimentality. And he has elicited delightfully nuanced performances particularly from Mann Cooke and Cyler. Mann is excellent as a guy whos afraid to live up to his potential. Cooke brings to Rachel an empathetic charisma. And Cyler is by turns engagingly droll and explosively hilarious.""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a must-see -- and one of the best films of the year.What ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl""  Four stars out of four  Run time 145  Rating PG-13  Content Sexual content drug material language thematic elements  Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Me And Earl And The Dying Girl Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-dispatch Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

(Anne Marie Fox/AP) A movie review of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" This sweet and smart comedy follows a couple of movie-mad teenagers who befriend a classmate stricken with leukemia. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times How many movie references can you squeeze into one sweet and funny film? ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" -- the big winner at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival -- tests the limits with a smart script built around a couple of movie-mad teenagers who cant stop making low-budget imitations of ""Mean Streets"" ""Citizen Kane"" ""Apocalypse Now"" and other classics. The three kids named in the title are high-school survivors. Greg (Thomas Mann) gets by mostly by making himself appear to be invisible. His best friend Earl (RJ Cyler) helps him make miniature movies. Rachel (Olivia Cooke) is a classmate who has just been told she has leukemia. Movie Review 1/2   Me and Earl and the Dying Girl with Thomas Mann Olivia Cooke RJ Cyler Molly Shannon Nick Offerman Connie Britton. Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews. 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language. Several theaters. Gregs mother (Connie Britton) insists that Greg befriend her. Awkward at first wary that their relationship is based on pity the three form a bond thats mostly drawn from Gregs deadpan stand-up style. Mann is simply perfect for the role and Cooke and Cyler bring a weight to their characters that lends a necessary balance to the movies tone.

"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; me-and-earl-and-the-dying-girl ) Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (United States 2015) June 18 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli At first glance one could assume this is just another ""cancer romance"" but such a glib description does Me and Earl and the Dying Girl a disservice. As brought to the screen by director Alfonso Romez-Rejon and writer Jesse Andrews (adapting his novel) the movie is affecting without being overly sentimental humorous without being inappropriately comedic and quirky without being self-indulgent. Although there might be an occasional misstep along the way Me and Earl and the Dying Girl consistently hits the right notes earning both the tears and smiles that result. The story is told from the perspective of Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) an unreliable narrator. Although Gregs voiceover provides information not otherwise available to the viewer he is not to be trusted. Its hard to reconcile some of Gregs statements with the films title and captions that remind us that its ""Day XX of a Doomed Friendship."" Some of Gregs thoughts and imaginings make their way onto the screen by way of crude animated sequences that are at times a little too cute and arty but thats a minor quibble. Greg is a socially awkward high school senior who is as ambivalent about the future as he is about the present. He has only one true friend - Earl (RJ Cyler) a boy he has known since grade school and with whom he makes bad home movies. He and Earl have assembled a large library of these projects all of which are parodies of classics (""A Sockwork Orange"" for ""A Clockwork Orange"" for example.) Gregs life is on a fast track to nowhere (he is studiously avoiding applying for college) when his mothers interference pushes him into the orbit of classmate and neighbor Rachel Kushner (Olivia Cooke) who has just been diagnosed with leukemia. The relationship that develops between Greg and Rachel is beautifully handled by Romez-Rejon and Andrews. Its believable from awkward start to inevitable end. A non-sexual romance the interaction  encompasses the complex issues associated with how young adults cope with impending death at an age when they typically think of themselves as immortal. Greg and Rachel love each other but they never say the word and dont even go so far as to kiss. Their bond is stronger than that of a traditional male/female platonic friendship - her mortality demands an emotional investment that few teenagers are ever forced to make. The decision to go with low-profile actors rather than internationally recognized ""names"" works well. Thats not to say that the cast of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl exists in obscurity but none of the performers comes burdened by the heavy baggage associated with stardom. Olivia Cooke is more believable than 90% of screen cancer patients. Thomas Mann has a less ""showy"" role but hes as good as Cooke when it comes to inhabiting a character. Greg reminds us that cancer claims victims other than those whose bodies it infiltrates. Mann isnt afraid to make Greg unlikeable when thats what an honest reading of the script requires. There are some recognizable actors in supporting roles.  Molly Shannon grasps the essence of Rachels mother - a woman coping in her own way with the distressing tragedy of watching her only child slip away. Nick Offerman is a little too over-the-top as Gregs offbeat father - hes the only character in the film I never believed. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl contains enough wit and understated comedy to offset the seriousness of the underlying story. The lighter tone never threatens to undermine the dramatic elements but it keeps the movie from becoming lugubrious. Despite having limited feature directorial experience Romez-Rejon exhibits flawless command. The film is better grounded and less melodramatic than The Fault in Our Stars another well constructed ""cancer romance"". Winner of both the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Award at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival Me and Earl and the Dying Girl has the qualities necessary for a festival darling to thrive outside of the rarefied air in which it debuts. The movie deserves wide appreciation for the intelligence and understanding it brings to an emotionally difficult story and the way it allows the audience to appreciate the experience rather than feeling manipulated by it.

Photo Credit (Anne Marie Fox/Fox Searchlight advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A reclusive high-school film buff reluctantly befriends a girl with leukemia. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE A weepy romance that tries hard to be quirky and cool. More sincerity might have helped. CAST Thomas Mann Olivia Cooke RJ Cyler. LENGTH 144 Greg Gains the young protagonist of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" isnt your usual teenage loner. Hes remarkably social actually with connections to nearly every clique in his Pittsburgh high school jocks goths even the theater kids. By keeping his acquaintances casual Greg has established what he calls ""citizenship in every nation"" yet remains a man without a country. Thats an interesting character possibly even a new one in the annals of teen movies. Greg played by a convincingly vulnerable Thomas Mann (""Beautiful Creatures"") is a good kid with a creative streak -- hes a budding filmmaker -- but we can see the shallow adult he might become. Luckily he has Earl (RJ Cyler) a tough kid from a broken home who helps Greg shoot movies and provides the occasional reality check. Gregs comfy little world gets a jolt when his perceptive mother (a very good Connie Britton) forces him to visit a classmate diagnosed with leukemia. advertisement | advertise on newsday Olivia Cooke plays Rachel the dying girl of the films title. Its clear from the start that Rachel will break through Gregs jaundiced flippant facade but the problem with ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is that it strikes the same false pose as its hero. Much like last years ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this movie insists that it isnt just another corny weeper -- but of course it is and it feels like a bait-and-switch. Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon from Jesse Andrews screenplay (based on his own novel) ""Me and Earl"" is often smart and funny but even these qualities serve as distancing mechanisms. The film strains to avoid cliches by going into eccentricity overload. The critically approved soundtrack (heavy on Brian Eno) cool casting (Nick Offerman plays Gregs oddball father) and art-house in-jokes (Greg and Earl make spoof-movies with titles like ""A Sockwork Orange"") seem designed to separate this hip romance from a square old one like ""Love Story."" Really though whats the difference? Whenever ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" dares to be sincere it tends to work. More of those moments would have helped this heart-tugger hit its mark.

It earns them. With Thomas Mann and RJ Cyler.Olivia Cooke Thomas Mann and RJ Cyler stars as the titular trio in ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.""(Photo 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4.5 stars (out of 5)The actors are all good never overplaying the drama.There is a suprising amount of humor in the film; it earns its emotional payoffs.""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a movie that practically dares film snobs to slam it.Good. Its up to the challenge. Yes its self-referential and self-aware and meta in the way that it lets you know that it knows that you know that its being so. A lesser movie would fold under that kind of headache-inducing narrative knot-tying.Luckily ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" isnt a lesser movie.Whats clear from the start is that director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon loves films. His is based on a script by Jesse Andrews who based it on his novel. As the title implies this is ""The Fault in Our Stars"" territory. But that was a movie engineered to wring maximum tears out of its audience.Interview Earl cast and director talk about the filmGomez-Rejon wants something more. He manipulates plenty here but never your emotions. What he gets out of you on that front he earns.Thomas Mann plays Greg the ""me"" of the title. Hes a high-school senior who has managed to sail along by never joining any clique but being friendly with all of them. It has saved him heartbreak and embarrassment but hes not what you would call engaged.Hes got one friend though hes so aloof he doesnt call him that Earl (RJ Cyler) a Black kid who lives in a rough part of town and shares Gregs interest in films and filmmaking. Theyve seen practically every great art film and have set about remaking some as spoofs with whimsical titles like ""A Sockwork Orange"" or ""Eyes Wide Butt"" or their current project ""A Box of Tulips Wow"" their take on ""Apocalypse Now."" Theyre silly and both Earl and Greg say theyre not any good but they show a strength of imagination uncommon in kids their age.Plus theyre funny.One day Earls mother (Connie Britton) and father (Nick Offerman) sit Greg down for some bad news Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a classmate has been diagnosed with leukemia. Its sad Greg agrees but he balks when his mother insists he spend some time with Rachel -- he barely knows her.But off he goes to her house where Rachels boozy mother (Molly Shannon) greets him ... interestingly. She introduces him to Rachel who immediately announces that she isnt interested in pity. But he begs her just to hang out for a while so he can satisfy his moms demands.More 2015 summer movie guideOK one second. If this sounds like another movie where the focus is on the wrong character where a young womans illness is being used as a device to help make another character stronger and more mature well I cant argue that it isnt. But the focus has to be on someone and Mann is so natural and so likable as Greg its not a major problem (at least it wasnt for me).It helps things on this front when Earl becomes more involved in Rachels life. Hes kind of an auxiliary friend to her; they bond over their shared frustration with Greg to meaningfully commit to anything.As the months pass Greg and Rachel grow closer. He points out every so often that in most movies the two would fall for each other thorny problems solved with a well-timed kiss. But this is not as he also points out time and again most movies.AZCENTRALMe and Earl and the Dying Girl (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsAlong the way he and Earl decide that the greatest gift they can give Rachel is a movie -- her movie a tribute to her. Of course theyve never made a movie that wasnt purposely bad before so this proves to be a challenge. But the payoff is well worth the false starts and procrastinations -- for the audience and for Rachel. Though not in ways that you would expect.Gomez-Rejon plays with expectations throughout actually. He often allows the characters to telegraph their breaks from convention but that proves to be less annoying than youd think. Its a fine line between being gratingly self-conscious and really smart; more times than not ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" comes out on the winning side of that equation.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres an air of precocious genius around ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" which despite its glum title is an inspired existential comedy. Yes its about two high school boys and a girl cancer and young love. But it is far wiser than all that and free of stock figures. It brims with self-referential jokes ranging from odd to downright absurd yet in emotional terms the story is a model of believability. Its about specific kids facing specific challenges. A major winner at this years Sundance this is the kind of movie that opens as a sleeper hit then surprises evokes and inspires tons of viewers into enduring fans. Set in a somewhat ramshackle side of Pittsburgh the film is about an oddball friendship between two schoolmates. The leading character and narrator is Greg (the titular ""Me"") who insists from the opening that we shouldnt worry this story has a completely happy ending. Hes an educated but underachieving senior with minimal interest in contributing to society. The ultralong shots that director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon uses to frame Gregs view of the schools crowded hallway make it clear this kid doesnt fit in. Thomas Mann beams in the part tackling the complex restless character like a junior Paul Dano. Fidgety silver-tongued a pile of self-critical oddities Greg spends the most free time possible with his colleague Earl (impressive R.J. Cyler) translating classics of world cinema into zany two-minute remakes. Rather than focus on their finals or college admission the misfits turn puppet footwear into ""A Sockwork Orange."" Or launch parodies like ""Eyes Wide Butt"" ""248 P.M. Cowboy"" or ""My Dinner With Andre the Giant."" Earl a cool character who generally acts like hes 10 minutes from jilting his pal for good never quite backs away from Greg. Like us Earl probably views him as ultimately adorable and empathetic and actually wants to spend time in his company. Then theres the girl. Gregs mother tired of his disconnected attitude guilts him into a sympathy assignment spending time with Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a classmate with leukemia. ""Youve got it all wrong"" he says nerdishly when they meet. ""Im not here because I pity you. Just because my moms making me."" As if that wasnt self-deprecating enough Rachel replies ""Thats actually worse."" One day they start talking the next they are bosom buddies. Shes as smart naive and grumpy as he is -- her social awkwardness about being ill matching his messed-up gawkiness. Amazingly Greg has met the yin that his yang always needed. Avoiding the arc of a standard teen romance the movie shows two kindred spirits going head over heels in a wildly entertaining way. ""If this was a touching romantic story our eyes would meet and suddenly we would be furiously making out with the fire of a thousand suns"" Greg narrates as he gazes at the smiling Rachel in her bedroom. ""But this isnt a touching romantic story."" Its a platonic connection that is completely utterly nonromantic like an adolescent ""Harold and Maude."" Or at least seems to be. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual content drug material language thematic elements. Theater Uptown. The supporting players better known than the stunningly sympathetic leads are too famous to cite without setting off spoiler alarms. Gomez-Rejon and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung are clearly in love with film classics as much as Greg and Earl are quoting images from Werner Herzog and ideas from Stanley Kubrick as if they were in a steal-from-the-masters competition. Like the story adapted from his young adult novel by Jesse Andrews the twisted elegance of their visuals is designed to put a little love in your heart. And get you to mutter ""Nice shot man."" And as you think about it all later in bed to bawl a tad.

Nearly every drop of human experience in it is mediated by movies not in some Godardian assault on false Hollywood narratives but to flatter an audience too self-consciously hip to swallow this story straight. Its a remarkably assured con-job -- but Im not sure that the director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and the screenwriter Jesse Andrews (adapting his own novel) havent conned themselves into thinking theyve captured the feel of modern adolescence better than anyone since Truffaut in The 400 Blows. A poster of Truffaut filming Jean-Pierre Leaud running along a beach makes that theory frighteningly plausible. The nominal focus is the ""doomed friendship"" between the narrator Greg (Thomas Mann) a co-director of comically cheap blockbuster-knockoff videos and a girl at his high school Rachel (Olivia Cooke) who has just been diagnosed with leukemia. Ive put ""doomed friendship"" in quotation marks because the words are repeatedly used in the intertitles (""Day 8 of the Doomed Friendship"" ""Day [Whatever] of the Doomed Friendship"") and so youre as conscious of the movies formal zaniness as you are of the girls escalating cancer. ""Earl"" (RJ Cyler) is Gregs African American companion who largely bonds with Rachel over their concern that Greg is scared of acknowledging any and all forms of friendship. Yes this is another black person who exists in a movie to help the white protagonist grow. But Rachel is a bit of a prop herself. At first she and Greg have a spiky relationship He has only come to visit her because his Mom (Connie Britton) insisted--in true meta fashion -- that spending time with a dying girl would be good for his soul. (""You have been given a real opportunity"") But after Greg and Rachel banter for a while you see in her eyes that shes thinking ""Hey hesA funny"" and a genuine smile spreads across her face. Cooke -- a 22-year-old Brit who was a regular onA Bates MotelA -- has an angel-soft face and eyes that grow even bigger as her face becomes more drawn. She spends a lot of time moaning about how ugly she has become but shes picture-perfect to the last. For some reason Gomez-Rejon (who worked as an assistant to Martin Scorsese before directing episodes ofA GleeA andA American Horror Story) is fond of fish-bowl lenses and the occasional Dutch angle. He and Andrews cut to Clay animation scenes of a moose stomping on a chipmunk whenever the high school hottie Madison (Katherine C. Hughes) approaches him. Nick Offerman seems to be in his own private sitcom as Gregs dad -- the running joke is that he serves Greg and Earl extreme fare of distant cuisines like East Asian shark--and Molly Shannon is directed to play all her scenes sotted with a full glass of wine in her hand. The tone is all over the place but I doubt that Gomez-Rejon would have it any other way. This isA not he might be sayingA The Fault in Our StarsA -- though that movie had its self-conscious meta jokes too.A Its obvious that I found much ofA Me and Earl and the Dying GirlA -- the sensation of this years Sundance Film Festival -- appalling but some of the final scenes snuck past my defenses. The climactic interaction between Rachel and the film that Greg has made for her is so ecstatically weird that it gets points for its audacity. Its almost inspired. But the coda -- an ode to Gregs self-sacrifice -- is unforgivable a testament to the ego- and power-trip that is the movies ultimate reason for being. If it becomes a touchstone for cinephile teens of this generation you can look forward to a lot more shitty films with filmmaker heroes groping their way towards empathy by staring through a camera lens.A Tagsme and earl and the dying girlmoviesmovie review Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories How UnREAL and the Republican National Convention Gave Us a Night of TV White Privilege Winona Ryder and the Power of Meta-Casting 8 Essential PokA(c)mon Go Tips Youall Want to Know Most Viewed Stories Constance Wu Slams Matt Damonas Great Wall Film for Perpetuating a aRacist Mytha 39.2k Shares Share Tweet LeBron James Reportedly Stopped Justin Bieber From Performing at the RNC 92 Shares Share Tweet John C.

Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures Greg (Thomas Mann) is jokey mostly as a substitute for actual social interaction. Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures A movie about high school students dealing with mortality -- havent we been dipping into that well a lot lately? So the surprise was the laughs when Me and Earl and The Dying Girl became the surprise smash at this years Sundance Film Festival taking both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize. Here was a film that managed to be at once earnest and flip capturing teen angst without wallowing in teen drama. The opening shots introduce us to Greg (Thomas Mann) a dweeby high school senior whos perfected the wisecrack as a substitute for social interaction. A member of no clique hes on friendly terms with everyone from jocks to goths to geeks because he only half-engages zooming down a hall hearing a snatch of conversation like say ""your test was today?"" and offering a bit of snark -- ""ugh tests been there"" -- without breaking stride. His one close buddy Earl (RJ Cyler) hes known forever. They bonded as kids while watching Gregs dads film collection and then coming up with punny titles for movie parodies -- A Sockwork Orange Senior-Citizen Kane -- they make with household detritus and toys. But being jokey and making videos does not prepare Greg for news his mother gives him about a classmate with leukemia -- Rachel (Olivia Cooke) whod been talking tests in that school hallway. Greg cringes when he realizes what tests she meant. Worse his mom insists that he go and spend time with Rachel though he barely knows her -- and social grace is lets say not his strong suit. Rachel lets him hang out and soon theyre bonding somewhat. The moviemaker in Greg senses that thats cool even as the highschooler in him senses that its emotionally treacherous. i Earl (RJ Cyler) is brought into the picture partly to protect Greg from too much pain if Rachels (Olivia Cooke) illness progresses. Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures Earl (RJ Cyler) is brought into the picture partly to protect Greg from too much pain if Rachels (Olivia Cooke) illness progresses. Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures Partly to protect himself from too much closeness and too much pain if Rachels illness progresses he brings Earl into their world and ends up opening himself up more than he intended when Earl mentions their movies outing him as it were as a creative soul in high school. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon -- working from a screenplay Jesse Andrews based on his own novel which was in turn somewhat autobiographical -- has a sure sense of the sort of kid who would use a camera lens as a shield. He also has an engaging way of using camera tricks -- weird angles voice-overs animation -- to get at the hormone-addled inanity that is teenagerdom. Nowhere more so perhaps than when the boys are working on their movies -- making their Apocalypse Now parody say A Box-of-Tulips Wow with toy soldiers parachuting into a vacant-lot jungle to rescue a box of origami tulips. In their no-budget-goofball way these minifilma are genius. Sheer genius. This kid you figure is gonna grow up to be quite a storyteller. And in a sense he did.

The films self-conscious self-deprecating tone is in sync with how gawky geeky teenagers try to have it both ways. By Peter Rainer Film critic June 12 2015 Save for later Saved Rachel (Olivia Cooke) and Greg (Thomas Mann) navigate the spectrum of teen social hardships in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. Anne Marie Fox/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.           View Caption About video ads View Caption of The funny-sad Sundance hit ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a winning movie about losing. I didnt always warm to its coy quirkiness but its the rare American movie about contemporary teenagers that rings more true than false. Greg (Thomas Mann) is a nondescript Pittsburgh high school senior with a supposedly foolproof formula for survival Be friendly with all the cliques without joining any of them. At lunchtime he and his best and only friend Earl (R.J. Cycler) eat in an indulgent teachers office rather than brave the school cafeterias social gladiator pit. When Gregs mother (Connie Britton) strong-arms him into visiting Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a fellow senior newly diagnosed with leukemia he balks. He barely knows Rachel and assumes (rightly) that she would interpret the gesture as a pity visit. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Gregs occasional voice-over narration fills us in on what he is thinking. When he and Rachel first connect for example we are informed that their relationship is not going to follow the predictable lovey-dovey route. Title cards periodically pop up such as ""Day 7 of Doomed Friendship."" But Gregs narration recorded after the events we are witnessing have long passed is possibly unreliable. Case in point About midway through the movie he tells us not to worry because Rachel doesnt die. Is he just trying to make us feel good? The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and his screenwriter Jesse Andrews (adapting his own novel) have a clear affection for these kids. They also are a lot more gooey than they let on. (Just like Greg.) Their pretense about avoiding sentimentality is just a decoy. ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is every bit as drippy as the conventions it pooh-poohs; its just cannier about how it twangs our heartstrings.Knowing all this I still didnt much mind the manipulations. The films self-conscious self-deprecating tone is in sync with how gawky geeky teenagers try to have it both ways. Its supercynical and supersappy at the same time. Greg has no illusions about being cool but he has an essential decency that Rachel recognizes and elicits despite his best efforts to appear aloof. His friendship with Earl also rings true despite a running gag I couldnt quite accept The two boys have a passion for making home movies that lampoon the classic art films in Gregs globe-trotting fathers collection. (Sample title ""A Sockwork Orange."") Werner Herzog comes in for some heavy ribbing and Truffauts ""400 Blows"" is practically a template for Gregs own milder form of rebelliousness. Its fairly funny although the boys fixation on art house cinema even as parody seems more of a filmmakers conceit than that of precocious teens. I could have done without the occasional animated sequences illustrating Gregs fantasies like the one where a moose (standing in for the resident high school hottie) unknowingly tramples a woodland mammal (himself). Its too cutesy by half. At times the facetiousness recalls ""(500) Days of Summer"" a movie ""Me and Earl"" more often than not transcends. At least its less annoying about its romantic poses.Mann is sometimes funny playing a nobody who is actually a somebody but his hangdog winsomeness can get a bit wearying. Cycler and Cooke though are real finds. Cooke never allows us to feel sorry for Rachel even when things are looking grimmest. It takes a real actress to pull that off.Cyclers Earl is a black kid from literally the wrong side of the tracks but there is never a moment when we feel he is being utilized by the filmmakers to make racially charged points. Young as he is Earl is his own man. He has a disdain for phoniness that Holden Caulfield would have appreciated. Come to think of it J.D. Salinger might have smiled at this movie except he didnt like movies. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for sexual content drug material language and thematic elements.)

The Citizen Kane of teen cancer tearjerkers Alfonso Gomez-Rejons funny and bruising Sundance sensation is like The Fault in Our Stars remade for Criterion Collection fetishists. Ostensibly spun from the same cloth as most YA dramas the film latches on to a generic high-school kid named Greg (Thomas Mann) who spends all of his time making parody versions of classic films (i.e. Eyes Wide Butts The 400 Bros) with his ""coworker"" Earl (excellent newcomer RJ Cyler). The videos are a great expression of Gregs cinephilia but whats the use in making so many movies if none of them are truly your own? Conveniently for Greg a local girl named Rachel (Olivia Cooke) has just been diagnosed with leukemia and theres no greater catalyst for a pubescent male movie character to come into his own than that. Despite an occasionally stilted pace and a few cartoonish touches (Molly Shannon plays Rachels mom with a broad sexual frustration that clashes with the rest of the material) Earl develops a rare emotional heft particularly when Greg is pressured to make Rachel an original film. The project forces Greg to eclipse his influences and risk doing something that puts himself on the line and Earl follows suit. Thanks to a restless visual dexterity and a brilliantly deployed soundtrack of Brian Eno tunes (Gomez-Rejon used to work for Scorsese and it shows) this spirited but safely familiar pastiche of John Hughes and Wes Anderson is eventually compelled to become its own thing embracing the most tired tropes of YA weepies so that it can kiss them goodbye.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 12 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 12 2015 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon Written by Jesse Andrews Starring Thomas Mann Olivia Cooke RJ Cyler and Molly Shannon Classification PG Country USA Language English Something for you me and the film geek Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a quirky self-aware dramedy with a vibe that is at turns wiseacre and wise with tear-jerking moments that are never maudlin and comic moments that are authentic.The main character - that would be Greg the ""me"" of the title - is a self-centred high school senior who takes pride in his superficiality. Hes also the candid narrator and one might chalk his self-loathing up to perceptiveness. Hes awkwardly uncool and hard to root for but not hard to watch. His coming of age is presented deftly and is played with mutilayered aplomb by Thomas Mann whom I assume well be seeing around more. Tina Fey Maya Rudolph and Martin Short take a photo of themselves at the Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary special on Feb. 15 2015.

(June 10) AP Video Video Video Fans flood premiere of Entourage movie in London The girl dying of leukemia clearly sees something in her awkward classmate and neighbour and because the character (played with understatement by the young actress Olivia Cooke) earned my trust from the get-go I was obligated to put in the 105 minutes to come around to her side.Greg plays his life as if its a game. He has no close friends - he makes cheeky DIY films with Earl (RJ Cyler) whom he describes as a ""co-worker"" - but displays deep guile in the way he cultivates alliances with the various cliques and characters at his high school. He makes a point of earning ""citizenship with every nation"" while firmly committing to none of the groups.When hes urged by his mother - ""the LeBron James of nagging"" - to spend time with Rachel recently diagnosed with cancer he trudges to her house reluctantly. There he is met by Rachels single mother played by former SNL cast member Molly Shannon an excellent character actor when given a chance as she is here.Greg describes his relationship with Rachel as ""doomed"" but he makes her laugh and provides a distraction. That he doesnt seem to feel sorry for her is exactly what she wants.The film is adapted from the young-adult novel of the same name a bestseller written by Jesse Andrews who makes his screenwriting debut here. He hammered the thing out with second-time director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon apparently a patient man.Comparisons will be made with last years The Fault in Our Stars but unlike that teenage-cancer story there are no romantic feelings to be had here from either side (even though the pair spend countless hours together in her bedroom). As she gets sicker Greg is forced from his emotional fort. He begins making a film for her to the exclusion of all of his school work.Gomez-Rejon has crafted a soulful story about a teenager dying. He manages to include a hilarious Hugh Jackman voice cameo with all sorts of cinematic winks nods and homages for the popcorn nerds. Most importantly he disdains kid gloves - they wouldnt be the right fit at all.

The Sundance favorite ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" sabotages itself by answering this question whoppingly offensively wrong. A dirtier quirkier take on the same material as last years slick cancer romance ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this self-consciously clever melodrama equates the value of a girls life with a boys realization that he should probably go to college. (That sound you just heard was the wistful sigh of a million high-school seniors who wish they had something that juicy to write about for their college-application essay.) Appropriate to its teenage milieu Alfonso Gomez-Rejons breakthrough film isnt unlike spending a couple of hours with an exceptionally witty high-schooler Its entertaining as hell but you cant help rolling your eyes a little at its self-satisfied pseudo-profundities. Also Read Ouija Star Olivia Cooke May Play Jack Hustons Sister in Ben-Hur Remake (Exclusive) To be fair its easy to see why the film became a festival darling. Based on Jesse Andrews novel of the name and adapted by the author himself ""Me and Earl"" is both densely packed with droll humor and deft in its emotional manipulations. It aims for and achieves a charming visual whimsy partly through Claymation sequences involving horses squirrels and ""the hot one from Pussy Riot."" Headed by a largely unknown but terrific core cast it feels bracingly contemporary if occasionally too glib in its cultural references. Its story of a detached dude finally learning to take himself his life and his relationships seriously is a familiar one but its at least told with goofy flourishes like a series of puns on cinema classics that comfortingly reassure us that growing up doesnt mean having to relinquish the weird the silly or the absurd. And yet its premise -- that high-school senior Greg (Thomas Mann) learns to embrace the future when it looks like his new leukemia-stricken friend Rachel (Olivia Cooke) wont have one of her own -- is so narcissistically narrated that the story repels with its self-absorption. (Unfortunately the film celebrates rather than scrutinizes Gregs self-centeredness.) Also Read Project X Star Thomas Mann Joins Kristen Wiig Will Ferrell Comedy (Exclusive) An amiable loner except for his lifelong pal Earl (R.J. Cyler) Greg is badgered into hanging out with a just-diagnosed Rachel whom he barely knows by his bossy mom (Connie Britton). Their first meeting goes about as well as youd expect from two teenagers forced into conversation; theyre too afraid to make eye contact and Greg hilariously jokes about touching himself too much. (One of the films better observations about adolescence is that teenagers are always terrified that theyre a lot more awkward than they actually are.) Greg and Rachel quickly establish an easy rapport -- a development aided by the fact that the sweet thoughtful girl has nothing else to do but become her new friends steadfast admirer. (Apparently the affection runs in the family; Rachels inappropriately flirty mom played by a game Molly Shannon also cant get enough of her daughters new friend.) Earl tells Rachel about the dozens of intentionally bad homages to movie masterpieces he and Greg have made together and so were treated to glimpses of ""The Seven Seals"" ""Breathe Less"" and ""A Sockwork Orange"" all adorably dumb. After learning of the duos films Rachels intimidatingly attractive friend Madison (Katherine C. Hughes) asks Greg to make a movie for the ill girl. He doesnt exactly agree to do it but as Rachel gets sicker he feels increasingly obligated to make something thats heartfelt and worthy and special. Of course thats easier requested than done. Also Read Connie Britton Joins Ryan Murphys FX Miniseries American Crime Story The People v. OJ Simpson Despite its lumpen one-sidedness Greg and Rachels blossoming friendship -- strictly platonic -- is believable and affecting particularly when theyre just riffing on things to amuse each other in her bedroom. (They bond over how best to avoid annoying well-wishers Act ""subhuman"" or just plain dead.) But the films tight focus on Gregs eventual need to budge from his comfort zone comes at the expense of Rachels credibility as a character. She makes a momentous decision that ultimately renders her illness a cheap plot device for Gregs maturation and the specter of death into mere college-essay fodder. If theres a lesson the scripts peddling its to answer when opportunism knocks. The better epiphany would have been that cluttering up a film with quips and visual gags and unusual camera angles can only go so far in covering up a cloying emotionally hollow core.

This brilliantly funny casually profound and deeply affecting coming-of-age chronicle directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon from a screenplay by Jesse Andrews even manages to be life-enlightening--its a fresh take on contemporary adolescence as a journey from ironic detachment to openhearted feeling.

Fox SearchlightOlivia Cooke Thomas Mann and RJ Cyler are the title stars of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.(Photo Fox Searchlight)Millennials dont have a John Hughes a guy who puts teenagers on the big screen in a meaningful watchable way.But they do have Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.Deftly juggling humor and heartache while always exuding a lovable quirkiness the excellent art-house comedy/drama (   1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in select cities Friday expanding June 19) showcases three teenagers who pop off the screen with originality and unlike a lot of the current coming-of-age ilk just the right amount of unpredictability.Screenwriter Jesse Andrews adapts his own young-adult novel and introduces Greg (Thomas Mann) a kid who survives high school by being everyones friend but no ones at the same time. His not-altogether-bad idea Blend in but dont stand out. The only person he lets in in any real way is Earl (newcomer RJ Cyler) a laid-back sort who calmly deals with Gregs neuroses.Gregs whole raison detre gets blown up when his mom (Connie Britton) nags him into submission about visiting Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a classmate whos diagnosed with leukemia. At first shes as awkward about this forced friendship as Greg but the two discover a bond that changes both of them.USA TODAYSweet scene bonds young Me and Earl starsEven though in voiceover Greg tells the audience ""this isnt a touching romantic story"" that doesnt mean director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon cant have a little fun with expectation.One senses he knows that people are just waiting for these two kids to have a love story akin to The Fault in Our Stars or any other entry in the teen-movie pantheon so the filmmaker frames shots where Greg and Rachel are on opposite sides of the room as they enjoy some of their most important connecting moments.Mann and Cookes chemistry is off the charts She really gets some meaty scenes as the cancer takes hold of Rachel and Mann follows suit as Greg wrestles with maybe losing this new positive force in his life.Cyler is a real discovery as Earl; the only negative is that the scene-stealing character isnt in the movie enough. The actor makes the most of his opportunities though especially as Earl transitions from sidekick to real friend giving Greg an emotional smackdown when he needs it most.USA TODAYHow Me and Earl created real teenagersThere are standouts among the grown-ups as well. Nick Offerman plays off his oddball Parks and Recreation role here as Gregs sociology professor dad an aloof figure who loves his cat and weird cuisine. Molly Shannon is excellent as Rachels worried wine-guzzling mom and Jon Bernthal is outstanding as a sensitively macho teacher who doubles as Gregs authoritative voice of reason.Me and Earl mines some serious drama but one of its most winning qualities is that it always finds time for whimsy mostly in the form of Greg and Earls ""remakes"" of classic films. Other movies opening this weekend may have rampaging dinosaurs but only one offers The Janitor of Oz and Rosemary Baby Carrots.Theres room for both laughter and tears as Me and Earl weaves its threesome into this generations next great love story. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1JILPbd",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/06/11/me-and-earl-and-the-dying-girl-movie-review/71033648/,200,meandearlandthedyinggirl21,meandearlandthedyinggirl,usatoday

Energetic storytelling and inspired visuals make this one an entertaining experience. Thats not to say it isnt manipulative but not in the ways youd imagine. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl stars Thomas Mann as Greg a guy skating through the minefield known as high school life. A good-natured slacker Greg has found a way to interact with all the various cliques at school without actually engaging with anyone. He zips past offering a smile a nod a quip; hes hiding in plain sight. (Not that hes unfeeling Greg turns to jelly whenever the school beauty played by Katherine C. Hughes speaks to him. Their exchanges are accompanied by charming animated bits that show how hot girls destroy your life. Cute.) Watch the trailer for Me and Earl and the Dying Girl The only person Greg considers a friend is Earl (RJ Cyler) a guy hes known since early childhood. Earl and Greg work together on ridiculous short movies that are send-ups of the classics they see courtesy of Gregs dad (Nick Offerman) an eccentric academic. A Sockwork Orange complete with footwear puppets is a typical example of their oeuvre. Gregs mom (Connie Britton) informs him one day that his childhood acquaintance Rachel (Olivia Cooke) has been diagnosed with leukaemia.  Mom also says that Greg has to visit her.  He doesnt want to go and Rachel doesnt particularly want to see him either but thanks to the little chapter headings that run through the movie we learn its Day 1 Of Doomed Friendship. Another section is called The Part Where Rachel and I Become Actual Friends.  Watching Rachel and Gregs low-key believable relationship unfold -- with some help from Earl -- is the heart of the movie. Rachel gets sicker. She pesters Greg into applying to college. Prom is approaching and the school beauty suggests to Greg that he and Earl should make a movie for Rachel. Greg and Earl have a falling out but it doesnt last. Greg eventually gets to show Rachel the movie he made for her. Get out your handkerchiefs. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a sweet-natured tale; alas its also self-conscious in a way that makes it in the end impossible to love. Parts of the film are wonderful -- hilarious dialogue manic camera-work a cast that includes Molly Shannon and Bobbe J. Thompson -- but youll never forget that youre watching a movie. It should be said that others dont have that issue. The film has won a handful of awards at film festivals including both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at Sundance. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl opens in Toronto on June 12. It will expand across Canada on June 19 and 26.

Anne Marie Fox/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Anne Marie Fox/Twentieth Century Fox Olivia Cooke as Rachel and Thomas Mann as Greg in Me And Earl And The Dying Girl. Anne Marie Fox/Twentieth Century Fox Not many teen movies would devote an entire montage to a joke about Errol Morris Interrotron. But for better and worse most teen movies arent Me and Earl and the Dying Girl. The scene parodying the documentary filmmakers signature interview technique may seem overly esoteric but in context it makes perfect sense. It comes as a young film obsessive tries to make a movie for a friend dying of cancer his loving attention to detail flying over the heads of the bemused classmates hes roped into being interviewed with the device. More than just a wink-wink to cinephiles the scene is the perfect encapsulation of how much difficulty our hero has fitting into the real world no matter how hard he tries to do right. ""Me"" is Greg a pale awkward teenage boy (is there any other kind in the movies?) played with gawky charm by Thomas Mann. ""Earl"" is Gregs only friend (RJ Cyler) a ribald kid who literally wanders into his life from the other side of the tracks. The two exist in a high school symbiosis that prevents them from having to get too close to anyone else instead living on the margins of every other social group. In between they spend their free time making parodies of classic cinema allowing Greg to show off his spot-on Werner Herzog impression. They also coast on the good graces of their demented history teacher (a scene-stealing Jon Bernthal) who has ""Respect The Research"" tattooed on his neck. Gregs perfect plan to sneak through teendom unnoticed is foiled by Rachel the ""dying girl"" a cute classmate whos been diagnosed with cancer. After Gregs mom (the always lovely Connie Britton) pushes him into socializing with this poor soul hes shocked to discover he actually enjoys spending time with Rachel. Maybe its because she only asks not to be pitied; because she finds his films cool; or because shes played with a wry smile and raw feelings by Olivia Cooke who has no interest in becoming just another terminal teen. Whatever the case Greg soon has a mission to make a film for Rachel and improve her mood as her health spirals downward. When he agrees to sit with her at lunch they enter the war zone of the cafeteria with grins so infectious they leap off the screen like the Cheshire Cats. Me And Earl won both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize at this years Sundance Film Festival which makes it the textbook definition of a crowd-pleaser. Its based on the novel by Jesse Andrews who also collaborated on the screenplay. Perhaps to ward off unfavorable comparisons to John Green and The Fault in Our Stars Andrews has deployed Gregs interior monologue with snarky acerbic digressions to strike like landmines at any sign of sentiment. Do Greg and Rachel seem like their blooming hormones are about to kick in during one of their hangout sessions in Rachels lush cavernous attic bedroom? Slow down shippers ""This isnt a touching romantic story"" Greg insists suddenly restaging the image so the two remain on opposite ends of the room. Its like a self-loathing Funny Games. Such insistence on chastity and dispassion may be novel for a high school saga but it also tries our patience. Greg and Rachel dont have to make out but couldnt they do something with the remaining time Rachel has on Earth other than just sit around watching movies? (Not that theres anything wrong with that.) Gregs perverse inaction is also at odds with Me and Earls many technical virtues which seem like they belong in a hipper more fanciful story. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon no doubt drawing from his time as personal assistant to Martin Scorsese and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu uses a series of long takes often stretching them past the point of comfort. In those pauses his actors make us feel the awkward disquiet of adolescent interactions that the script fails to deliver. Also film school students would kill to craft even one of Greg and Earls lo-fi masterworks which precisely mimic the aesthetics of their originals while adding potty humor puppets and stop-motion animation. Yet Greg refuses to acknowledge he has any passion for filmmaking. He snaps at his dad (Nick Offerman who seems born to be a teen movie dad) for making an innocuous comment about his talent. For Greg to keep insisting that none of this means anything forces the movie to lower itself to his level so that the principle conflict revolves around his own self-worth (he gives up on schoolwork and applying to college). This is at the expense of Rachel who surely has other things on her mind as her cancer progresses--and also Earl who doesnt get to develop beyond a one-note joke machine. Still it would be unfair to the films many virtues to only focus on what it gets wrong. If every teen movie were as buoyant stylish and aware of history as Me and Earl the cultural landscape would feel a lot smarter. The end-credit list of Greg and Earls filmography is worth the price of admission alone. A remake of the 1960 British thriller Peeping Tom called ""Pooping Tom""? Now thats respecting the research.

Comments click to enlarge Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Rated PG-13  105 minutes  2015 Jonathan Levines 50/50 (2011) broke new ground by turning a preeminent source of movie drama--young people battling cancer--into the stuff of wiseacre comedy. This similar effort adapted by Jesse Andrews from his own novel benefits from the earlier movies audacity without equaling it though its sardonic story of a high school misfit (Thomas Mann) ordered by his mother to befriend a leukemia-stricken classmate (Olivia Cooke) demonstrates a sharp eye for the teenage politics of pity. I didnt believe for a moment the subplot in which the hero and his poker-faced pal (RJ Cyler) shoot a series of home videos parodying famous art-house movies (ask someone that age to name a classic film and hell probably tell you The Breakfast Club).

Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (144). PG-13 Language. Area theaters. The charming soulful ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a movie that loves movies -- which is great because youll love this one. A winner at this years Sundance Film Fest the comedy-drama takes what we expect from teenage flicks and gives it a sharp sly spin of its own. Narratively the movie takes on a lot but its grown-up enough to do things with terrific style and soulfulness. Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is a nerdy Pittsburgh high-schooler coasting through senior year with a plan -- let no one get too close be amenable to all social groups keep all feelings at bay. Olivia Cooke and Thomas Mann in ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" Greg is not focused on college but he is a movie fanatic. He and his one pal Earl (RJ Cyler) ""remake"" classic movies using silly riffs on titles and plots ""A Box o Lips Wow"" shows a soldier in Vietnam finding a box of tulips. And they make a ""Vertigo"" spoof named ""Vered He Go?"" (They know the puns are bad.) When Gregs parents (Nick Offerman Connie Britton) ask him to visit Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a classmate with leukemia Greg plans to swing by make jokes and leave. But hanging with Rachel becomes his focus to the detriment of his schoolwork and his crush on a hottie (Katherine C. Hughes). Rachel is teaching Greg something he didnt count on. Adapted by Jesse Andrews from his own novel the movie trundles along on charm and a knowing sense of its own abilities until to paraphrase ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it gets busy thinkin about living and dying. Except this isnt ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Gregs voice-over keeps reminding us this isnt a bittersweet romance which is true. But that doesnt mean its neither of those. The fun Wes Anderson-esque personality that punctuates the movies first half -- when Claymation is used to illustrate an idea or we glimpse some of Greg and Earls cinematic ouevre -- eventually quiets down. The adults seem less goofy the wisecracks less wise-ass. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon coaxes us in with charm and a sharp confident visual style then gently reveals the storys conscience and heart. Cooke Mann and co-star RJ Cyler His cast does a high-wire walk expertly. We buy Mann as a goofball hiding behind smarts and snark and feel the gut punch as mortality creeps in on the lovely Cooke. Offerman dispenses wry life lessons as Gregs dad a professor as Jon Bernthal impresses as a cool teacher who lets Greg and Earl eat lunch and watch Werner Herzog films in his office. Rippling through it all is a gorgeous score by Brian Eno with original songs and a catalogue of tunes that bring up movie-related memories for Greg and for us. A lot of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" wears its heart on its sleeve. Other movies might not be able to do more than that or would get bogged down in the tricks and traps of such a sly comment on teenage genre films. This one is different. It embraces feeling good feeling bad feeling odd and crucially that all-too-rare feeling of discovery. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE FIRST VIDEO HERE AND THE SECOND VIDEO HERE.

Photo Anne Marie Fox MOVIE REVIEW Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Running time 104 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexual references drugs profanity). ""What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?"" goes the opening narration of the immortal ""Love Story"" (1970). ""That she was beautiful and brilliant? That she loved Mozart and Bach The Beatles and me?"" Theres no such lachrymose sentimentality -- let alone sex -- in ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" a funny hip touching and utterly irresistible comedy-drama about a trio of high-school misfits one with stage IV leukemia who bond over art films. Its roughly like a Wes Anderson-John Hughes remake of ""Love Story as overseen by Hal Ashby -- art-directed within an inch of its life and packed with look-at-me camera angles as well as sharp one-liners. And at times it does read like a prototypical quirk-filled Sundance Film Festival award winner complete with an African-American teenager whose primary function appears to be to help his white buddy. But the self-conscious direction of Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (""American Horror Story"") turns out to perfectly fit Jesse Andrews borderline-twee adaptation of his own novel and there are uniformly excellent performances by a perfectly chosen cast. The shaggily charming Thomas Mann (""Project X"") kills it as chronic underachiever Greg Gaines who negotiates high school by carefully avoiding friendships that might place him in one clique or another. RJ Cyler (left) and Thomas MannPhoto Anne Marie Fox Greg even insists on calling his BFF Earl Jackson his ""co-worker"" (RJ Cyler in what turns out to be a sly stereotype-busting role). They make short parodies like ""A Sockwork Orange"" when they arent watching actual art films in the office of their heavily tattooed history teacher (Jon Bernthal) or at Gregs home with his dad (Nick Offerman) a kimono-wearing sociology prof and exotic chef. Our hero is pushed out of his comfort zone when his mom (Connie Britton) forces him to pay a visit to terminally ill classmate Rachel (Olivia Cooke) whom he barely knows and who isnt at all interested in a pity party. But they quickly bond platonically over Gregs mordant and self-deprecating humor and their shared love of the arts. Olivia Cooke and Thomas MannPhoto Anne Marie Fox When Earl starts hanging out with them he mentions the short films which theyve never shared with anyone. Rachel adores them but a request that they make a film especially for Rachel forces Greg to focus on his conflicted feelings about the girl and her unhappy fate. Theres a lot of sharp comic dialogue but like Greg this wonderful movie doesnt shy from more painful moments that threaten to derail Gregs relationships with Earl and Rachel. ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" isnt perfect -- for starters Molly Shannons fine turn as Olivias chardonnay-sipping mom seems to belong in another movie. But its about as good as it gets for a summer movie and its many times superior to the similar ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Id love to see what Greg and Earl could do with that one.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday June 11 2015 Follow AnnHornaday It seems like just yesterday -- or at least just last year -- that we were bidding goodbye to a teen protagonist on his deathbed (""The Fault in Our Stars"") or hers (""If I Stay""). But dont put away those handkerchiefs quite yet ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" may keep tears at bay for as long as it can but they arrive nonetheless and right on cue. Adapted by the author Jesse Andrews from his novel of the same name ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" was the big hit at Sundance this year and its easy to see why The story of three teenaged misfits navigating adolescence love and death in middle-class Pittsburgh bristles with sardonic humor and bravura bursts of visual energy. Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon with a surfeit of zooms swooping close-ups and dramatically canted camera angles ""Me and Earl"" is as much a playful heartfelt love letter to movies as to the bittersweet lessons of mortality and friendship. The endless film references and studied self-conscious style can prove distracting until the audience settles in and comes to understand why theyre justified. The ""Me"" of the title a high school senior named Greg (Thomas Mann) is a movie fanatic as is his best friend Earl (RJ Cyler); eschewing the cliques and claques of their peers they spend most of their time constructing silly sardonic remakes of the films they worship giving them titles like ""Pooping Tom"" and ""The Seven Seals"" the latter of which repurposes the Bergman classic as a romp featuring well seals. Its all calculatedly adorable as are on-screen chapter headings that all start with ""The Part Where . . ."" and the budding relationship between Greg and Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a girl he knows only slightly but gets to know better at the insistence of his mom played with furrowed concern by Connie Britton. (His dad a perpetually bathrobe-clad academic is played with curmudgeonly humor by Nick Offerman.) If youre still reading this is The Part Where You Figure Out that Rachel is the third title character of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" -- Andrews does his best to misdirect the viewer away from that spoiler but few surprises lurk in the broad strokes of the plot. Instead the revelations come by way of small funny moments like the slightly off-center observations of Rachels glassy-eyed mom (Molly Shannon) Gregs real and imagined encounters with his school cohorts (especially a pretty girl hes crushing on) a suspected case of an LSD-laced bowl of Vietnamese pho and of course the affecting life lessons he learns not just from the wise and funny Rachel but from Earl. Another giveaway ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is structured in accordance with its title with Greg given pride of narrative place and Rachel and Earl relegated to supporting players in his drama. They arent given much by way of their own interior lives and Earl especially is relegated to the kind of wisecracking comic relief that ""the black friend"" has historically been relied upon to provide on the emotional journey of a white protagonist. Similarly Rachels character only comes into full focus once shes off screen by which time Greg can fully appreciate her gifts and of more paramount importance what shes taught him. ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" succumbs to the same cloying too-cuteness and solipsism that often plague its glib and sentimental genre. But those limitations are leavened by the films lively ultimately affecting flourishes and sprightly voice. In the hands of filmmakers as energetic as Andrews and Gomez-Rejon the teen weepie is a story that can be retold as many times as you can fully drench a hankie wring out and repeat. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sexual content profanity and some thematic elements. 105 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Olivia Cooke Thomas Mann and RJ Cyler star in ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" which deals with a teens illness with uncommon wit and sensitivity. Photo Anne Marie Fox Associated Press Me and Earl ... You wont want to see it but youll like it 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Its best to mention this going in that this is going to be a weird review. In it Im about to recommend a movie I would not see in a thousand years. Id say a million but I have no idea how a million would play out. But for sure a thousand years would be too short a time to locate an impulse to see a movie called ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" Of course it might be different if ""the Dying Girl"" in question turned out to be the name of a boat or a horse or a ballet. But no this is a film about a teenage boy who is thrust into a friendship with a classmate who has an advanced case of leukemia. It would hardly seem possible but the movie is often very funny yet without diminishing for a moment the seriousness of the illness or of illness in general. So just in terms of tone ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a notable achievement. The movie walks several delicate lines at once between farce and tragedy and comedy and drama. And it doesnt even seem to be walking those lines so much as skipping and running along them with an effortless sense of its own very specific truth. That kind of unself-conscious specificity can only be achieved by experienced hands or inspired novices and in this case it was the latter. It is the first feature film by director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon from the first screenplay by Jesse Andrews who adapted his own (debut) novel. Perhaps the key to the movie is that its not about average people experiencing something so bad that its interesting. Its about characters who are interesting in themselves experiencing something bad and inconvenient. Without the illness these characters might have been worth a movie on their own. The ""Me"" of the title is Greg through whom the story is told. As played by Thomas Mann Greg is a fascinating mix -- witty and clever with a subterranean self-esteem and an elaborate strategy for surviving high school in spite of it. His idea is to be mildly friendly to everyone and engage with no one except Earl (RJ Cyler) with whom he makes a series of short films. He never refers to Earl as his friend but as his business partner. The friendship with Rachel is forced on him. His mother is friends with her mother and when the word comes that Rachel is sick his mother insists that he go to see her. Rachel doesnt want to be visited and Greg has nothing to say to her but gradually they find they have things in common -- an arch sense of humor an appreciation of art an outsiders angle on things. Stories in which one persons illness makes someone else a better person tend to be by their nature obnoxious in that they miss the point. The crisis is about the sick person and what theyre going through not about what gems of the spirit can be gleaned from anothers suffering. Yet though ""Me and Earl"" conforms to that basic pattern it doesnt offend possibly because Rachel cares about Greg as much as the viewer does and possibly because the movie doesnt ever try to make sense of Rachels illness. Leukemia is never anything other than terrible something that sometimes can be ignored and sometimes cant. Gomez-Rejon matches the wit of the script with gently witty touches such as the clever use of a fishbowl lens. He also relies on his actors for long takes which give the movie a lived-in naturalistic feeling. One particularly tasteful touch is his way of filming the door opening to Rachels room each time Greg visits. It creates a breathless sense of not knowing what to expect. So this is a very worthy movie not that this will hold any sway with illness-phobes whod rather stare at the wall for 105 minutes than see a good movie about sickness. Still its safe to say that ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" will be enjoyed by everyone -- who doesnt deliberately avoid it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A calling card film if ever there was one Alfonso Gomez-Rejons Me And Earl And The Dying Girl applies the off-beat camerawork and meta-movie high jinks of his not-quite-remake of The Town That Dreaded Sundown to a geek coming-of-age story. Its values are pure film school abrupt artificial camera movements; unbroken takes that draw attention to their length; references that feel less like homage than compulsive listing. The exam-like ""this is what I know this what I can do"" mentality produces plenty of zany aesthetic choices but at the expense of qualities like character; this is one of those cases where the means largely obfuscate the ends which arent that interesting to begin with. Which would be fine if Gomez-Rejon--an American Horror Story veteran who spent time as an assistant to Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Martin Scorsese--was more of a full-fledged stylist. A feature-length tribute to great directors with no direction of its own his second feature is the kind of self-consciously quirky slapdash movie that still leaves a viewer eager to find out what its director will do next.Adapted by Jesse Andrews from his own novel Me And Earl is set over the course of a school year in Pittsburgh as senior Greg (Thomas Mann) befriends Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a girl with leukemia and hangs out with his lifelong best friend Earl (R.J. Cyler). Greg is an amalgam of blank-slate white male coming-of-age protagonist tendencies and college-cool tastes; Rachel and Earl are single-trait characters--terminally ill and black respectively--that only function as reflections of Gregs maturity or lack thereof. The characterizations are broad across the board though the grown-ups are generally more interesting Nick Offerman doing a kind of mirror-universe Ron Swanson as Gregs dad a sarong-wearing cat-loving professor with a thing for exotic cuisine; Molly Shannon as Rachels mom never seen without a wine glass; Jon Bernthal as Greg and Earls heavily tattooed history teacher. Its a cartoonish teen movie about aesthetic values though not artistic ones quick to point out its own breaks with convention (e.g. it isnt a love story which qualifies it as fresh in todays YA adaptation landscape) and chock-full of the kind of moves that get teenagers interested in filmmaking straight dollies whip pans jokey title cards self-aware voice-over narration.Though its refreshing to see a new American indie that puts this much stock into form thinking outside the handheld-shot-reverse-shot box is only the first step toward a personal vision. No amount of arty compositions (courtesy of Stoker and Oldboys Chung Chung-hoon) can bring the relationship between Greg and Rachel to life and one eventually begins to think of the plot--which finds amateur filmmakers Greg and Earl trying to make a movie for their new friend--as the thing thats getting in the way of the quotes and name-checks that are the movies real raison detre. There are send-ups of Andy Warhols Screen Tests Powell and Pressburgers Archers production company logo and Errol Morris Interrotron interview system; hand-made parodies of A Clockwork Orange The Conversation and Breathless; semi-ironic quotations of the scores to Vertigo and The 400 Blows; and so many references to Werner Herzog that he could qualify for fourth billing. Though fitfully funny these cant mask the movies fundamental emptiness. The climax set to Brian Enos ""The Big Ship"" pulls out the ultimate young film-buff move by using a sublime piece of music to prop up a scene--basically a series of wordless reaction shots--that doesnt work emotionally. For better or worse it feels like the movie its protagonist would make with plenty of movie-hip gestures toward nothing in particular.

"Me and Earl and the Dying Girl review Tender humorous romance - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Me and Earl and the Dying Girl review Tender humorous romance Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Twentieth Century Fox Film RJ Cyler as Earl left Nick Offerman as Gregs Dad and Thomas Mann as Greg in ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" RJ Cyler as Earl left Nick Offerman as Gregs Dad and Thomas Mann as Greg in ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" (Twentieth Century Fox Film) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Disarming ode to teenage cinephilia and the power of friendship. The big noise from this years Sundance Film Festival ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is a weaselly liar of a movie. It comes on full of self-deprecating bluster professing no interest in jerking tears a la ""The Fault in Our Stars"" as it lays out its tale of a Pittsburgh high school seniors friendship with a fellow classmate diagnosed with cancer.But gradually as the narrator-protagonist learns to lower his emotional guard the film lunges sensitively for the jugular. This was a film about a kid for whom cinema is all destined to be launched in the company of movie geeks at a major festival. Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejons comedy-drama spurred a bidding war won by Fox Searchlight at Sundance where it won the two top prizes. With an appealing perma-shrug and wry air of self-defeatism Thomas Mann plays Greg the ""me"" of the title. This half-abrasive half-genial social misfit spends most of his free time remaking Criterion Collection titles such as ""The 400 Blows"" or ""Mean Streets"" as mini-spoofs with a relatively straight face.Gregs best friend is surly yet supportive Earl played by RJ Cyler. Their relationship is defined by nattering film references by the ton interrupted by the occasional yearning for their schools females. The dying girl is Rachel portrayed by Olivia Cooke. Her sphinxlike way of tolerating Gregs supreme social awkwardness plausibly gives way to deep affection even when the script makes you take that part on faith. Egged on by his mother (Connie Britton perfect in an imperfectly pencil-sketched part) Greg is guilted into befriending Rachel after she receives her leukemia diagnosis leaves school and confines herself largely to her room. Rachels mother (Molly Shannon) copes with the situation with a glass of the nearest available whatever.""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" deflects its own young adult best-seller cliches by carving up the story as Andrews did in his rather raunchier 2012 novel into chapters with titles such as ""The Part Where I Meet a Dying Girl"" or ""Day One of Doomed Friendship."" If Bertolt Brecht entered the YA market with help from the guys who wrote ""(500) Days of Summer"" then youd have something like Gomez-Rejons sophomore feature.

The location work in Pittsburgh captured well and fluidly by cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung is full of forgiving light and graceful hill-dotted compositions.The chief limitation of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is an old story However touching Cookes Rachel is there mainly to prop up the sweetly messed-up young male lead and then to quietly guide him toward adulthood. At the same time ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is often very funny and many will weep big buckets of laughter-through-tears. Gomez-Rejon has a seriously promising future; this film is shot in a hundred different styles reflecting the sentimental and cinematic education of its protagonist.Phillips is a Tribune critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune Me and Earl and the Dying Girl Anne Marie Fox Twentieth Century Fox Film A scene from ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl.""

From a popular novel embraced by the teenage market Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a sweet affectionate coming-of-age story about kids living with the cruel vicissitudes of death that makes crying heart-healthy. Think The Fault in Our Stars and reach for the Kleenex. ME AND EARL AND THE DYING GIRL  (3/4 stars) Written by Jesse Andrews Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon Starring Thomas Mann RJ Cyler and Olivia Cooke Running time 105 min. This one is about an unconventional high school senior in Pittsburgh named Greg Gaines (played by the remarkable Thomas Mann) a movie junkie who eschews everything about organized school activities from sports to proms to hanging out in the cafeteria preferring instead to spend all of his time with his friend Earl (RJ Cyler) a black boy from a poor neighborhood making their own cheap offbeat re-titled versions of classic films. Instead of the latest date flick Greg whose room is decorated with posters of The 400 Blows likes foreign films that are ""confusing and pointless like life."" Some of his favorite homemade parodies are ""Pooping Tom"" and ""Death in Tennis."" These are the years when kids just mark time trying to survive without drawing too much attention to themselves. Greg is smart and appealing to everyone but himself and suffers from a punishing lack of self-esteem. Instead of hero-worshiping Justin Bieber he imitates Werner Herzog. Movies are a way to escape the touchy-feely benevolence of his doting parents--a mom who is ""basically like the LeBron James of nagging"" and a bewildering dad who is home a lot barefoot and eating cereal. One day Greg finds out a pretty classmate named Rachel (Olivia Cooke) has been diagnosed with fatal leukemia and his worst fear of getting close to a member of the opposite sex is realized when his mother forces him to befriend her. Reluctantly he pays her a visit. Shes just as frightened of a different gender as he is but he tries to cheer her up--with fear dread and resentment at first then a sympathy that turns to genuine concern. Shes unresponsive until he shares his movie library of 42 films. Shes particularly fond of a takeoff on Rashomon he calls ""Monorash"" and an outrageous take on Midnight Cowboy titled ""248 P.M. Cowboy."" Greg and Earl go through the usual fights jealous epiphanies and growing pains but the thing that keeps them bonded is a movie theyre making about Rachel as an alternative to the way everyone else treats her like a Hallmark card. To their surprise this unlikely trio of misfits with their special language and a vocabulary that has a rhythm of its own forms a tender relationship based on honesty trust and something like love. When Rachels condition inevitably deteriorates the boys are changed forever. The three leads are unknown but wonderful. Jesse Andrews screenplay (adapted from his book) and Alfonso Gomez-Rejons direction try to avoid all of the inherent sentimentality but hell its a movie about dying of leukemia and showing a brave face when your heart is breaking. You can do just so much without a small pack of Kleenex. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl treats a serious subject with wackadoodle humor that is endearingly contagious. Its tender clever wise and highly recommended.

But ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" manages to pull it off delivering an unusual story that combines get-the-Kleenex teen melodrama with plenty of wry film-school jokes. Too many film-school jokes perhaps - although theyre one of the best parts of the movie they also tend to overwhelm the movie. But theres still a lot of real sentiment poking through. The movie set in the nicely authentic rust-belt environs of Pittsburgh stars Thomas Mann as Greg a high-school senior whos drifted through high-school by forging superficial truces with all the various cliques. He has one friend Earl - played by the no-nonsense R.J. Cyler -- and one passion Shooting thats-not-punny-thats-shtick movie parodies like ""A Sockwork Orange."" Then his do-good mother pushes him to visit to Olivia Cookes Rachel a classmate whos just been diagnosed with leukemia. And no the two teens dont fall in bittersweet love (as Greg warns us early on). But what happens is a lot better and a lot rarer in movies of any kind let alone teen-oriented ones about goofy boys and pretty girls - they become genuine respectful supportive friends. Thats actually a pretty liberating breakthrough - how many real male/female buddy movies have you seen? - and when it keeps it at its center ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is at its best as it shows two rather guarded young people slowly learning to trust. In fact those scenes are good enough that you may wish it eased back on the comedy a little bit. Its one of those movies that stacks the deck with eccentrics and while some characters are terrific (like the heros dad a mad multi-culti sociologist played by the never-disappointing Nick Offerman) others dont really register or come across as simple sideshows - like Rachels tipsy Mom or Earls angry brother. And while the film parodies are undeniably funny there are so many of them that they become a distraction from the real story at hand. (And perhaps as they are in Gregs own life a safe way to keep from focusing on some uncomfortably real emotions.) But that doesnt stop ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" - which features tremendous cinematography by South Koreas great Chung-hoon Chung - from holding your interest from beginning to end. And occasionally touching your heart in a way that few recent teen films have. In fact Im tempted to give Greg and Earl an idea for their next parody project ""The Spectacular Wow."" But I think theyve already made it. Seriously. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and substance abuse. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (105 min.)

But its surely the most adorable for better or worse -- less like The Fault in Our Stars and more like Diary of a Wimpy Kid reconfigured for a slightly older hipper audience and with cancer thrown in.Its so carefully designed to feel laid-back that its breeziness comes off like a calculation; its emotional pull is sometimes irresistible which may make you want to resist it all the more. But the movie has flashes of wit and originality and feeling. (It won this years Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at Sundance.) And it doesnt hurt that this adaptation of Jesse Andrewss 2012 novel -- directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon from a screenplay by Andrews -- was shot in Pittsburgh on real streets that look like places where people actually live. Some scenes were even filmed in the house in which Andrews himself grew up (and where his parents still live) a pretty Victorian thats well kept but also comfortably worn around the edges. The shelves in the living room are lined with books that you can tell werent chosen and arranged by some production designer.Film Details Me and Earl and the Dying Girl RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time104 min. More Info Trailer So even when the story twists in directions it maybe shouldnt -- and keeps adamantly promising a plot resolution thats different from the one we ultimately get -- its still easy enough to coast along with Me and Earl. Thomas Mann (who played one of the wild partiers in Project X) is Greg a smart but awkward high school senior who has turned his unwillingness to fit in at school into a survival tactic Instead of choosing to hang out with just one group -- like the theater geeks goths or stoners -- he surfs the spaces between each professing a benign noncommittal and thus false friendliness toward all. This gangly kid with a way-too-nasal voice has exactly one friend Earl played by the half-snazzy half-deadpan RJ Cyler lives on the other side of town a side thats not nearly as nice as Gregs. The two have been pals since childhood though Greg wary of the commitment that the word ""friend"" represents refers to Earl as his ""co-worker."" Long ago Greg and Earl found out they shared a taste for European art films fostered by Gregs sociology-professor dad played by a whiskery Nick Offerman who spends much of the movie drifting around in a terrycloth bathrobe just as you can believe a sociology professor would. Now Greg and Earl have become amateur filmmakers themselves filling up a shelf with parodies of film-school classics that they produce direct and star in -- the titles include Senior Citizen Kane A Sockwork Orange and my personal favorite Monorash. EXPAND Fox Searchlight Gregs ideas of what friendship can mean get upended when his meddlesome mother (Connie Britton) insists that he ring up a leukemia-stricken classmate he barely knows Rachel (Olivia Cooke). Rachel her hair a thatch of unruly waves -- until of course she starts losing it -- is a somber girl whos smart enough to know that she doesnt want or need anyones charity friendship. And yet the two become close helped along undoubtedly by some of the marvelous Brian Eno music on the movies soundtrack The montage-y scene in which they finally click is set to Enos ""Ill Come Running"" as sublime a song about loyalty as has ever been written.Yet to me the films more resonant friendship is the one between Greg (whos white) and Earl (whos black) Thats partly because the unspoken ease between the two plays mischievously with the idea of the token black friend. Forget tokens -- until Rachel comes along Earl is Gregs only friend. When Greg makes the trek from his nice house to Earls not-so-nice one hes greeted by a cranky pit bull and an older brother of Earls he finds vaguely menacing. Greg is neither hip to nor put off by that setting; its just different. Earl and Greg live in separate worlds of stereotypes but the place where they come together -- the kinship they find over those ridiculous homemade movies -- is a world of their own making.Whats more its Earl who at first can talk most easily to Rachel loosening her up making her laugh treating her as a person and not a cancer victim -- hes more at ease with the world than Greg is. Some of the gags in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl feel a bit tired and oversold like the way Rachels boozy mom (played by Molly Shannon) insists on cuddling Greg inappropriately. And the picture sidles up too coyly like a hermit crab to its tearjerker ending -- a finale thats inevitable even though the filmmakers take great pains to make us think otherwise. The friendship between Greg and Rachel is engaging enough and these two performers are sweet together. But the lazy bond thats in place before the movie even starts that between Greg and Earl is the more intriguing. What brought these two together in the first place? We dont really know. Their solidarity is like a weed poking through the cracks in the sidewalk unlikely yet inevitable. Somehow it just happened and then grew without careful tending. A good friend sticks by you when you have cancer. A better friend sticks by you for no reason.Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. Written by Jesse Andrews. Based on the novel by Jesse Andrews.

TWITTER Thomas Mann plays a creative loner who finds himself entertaining a girl with leukemia. A smart-ass charmer merciless tearjerker and sincere celebration of teenage creativity Alfonso Gomez-Rejons Me and Earl and the Dying Girl got a standing ovation at its Eccles premiere today and deserved it. The tragicomic story of the friendship between a misfit teen his pal Earl and -- uh you get the idea -- is an illness pic without the guilt-inducing mawkishness or carpe diem platitudes. Film-geek friendly but thoroughly accessible and very funny it has the makings of a mainstream hit. Whats more the girl lives. Maybe. Thomas Mann plays Greg a high schooler who starts senior year confident that having diplomatic ties to all cliques but real friendships in none is the key to survival. His single bond is with Earl (RJ Cycler) the only other kid around who digs the foreign movies Gregs world-traveling dad (Nick Offerman) likes to watch. Together the boys make punny lo-fi parodies of the classics (for example A Sockwork Orange and Senior Citizen Cane). Forced by his pushy mom (Connie Britton) to visit a girl he hardly knows who was just diagnosed with leukemia Greg is appalled. But while Rachel (Olivia Cooke) is similarly aghast at the parentally obligated pity date she soon proves an easy crowd for Gregs comic material -- the sort of smart self-deprecating wit that is the stock-in-trade of teenage boys who know theyre not living up to their potential. They hit it off becoming fast friends and the movie knows what youre thinking More than once Gregs winning voiceover (written by Jesse Andrews from his novel) points out that no this is not where the two are going to lock eyes declare their love and tumble into each others arms. (Their failure to do that doesnt mean theyre not in love.) Greg manages perceptions in other ways as well assuring us that this girl were falling for is not going to do what the title implies. ""She survives ... so dont freak out."" By his second reassurance we may question Gregs motives. Is it just his desire to protect us as we enter his psyche -- a world in which the schools resident Hot Girl wounds him like a moose who tramples small woodland mammals without even knowing? Gomez-Rejon animates this colorful metaphor and some others as well overlaying the screen with helpful titles such as ""Day 7 of Doomed Friendship"" and shows us a few of Greg and Earls movies. The playfulness of the storytelling sometimes recalls (500) Days of Summer sometimes nods toward the more absurd moments in John Cusacks teen-angst comedies and inspires comparison to many other touchstones without feeling copied from any of them. Mann shaggy and insecure and unhandsome enough to get away with it when he complains of having an animals face makes an excellent Everyguy here and his funniness is unforced. Cyclers Earl is more overtly charismatic though similarly low-key (especially when raptly watching a Herzog or Powell and Pressburger DVD). And the film makes good but sparing use of him as a loose-lipped agent of change in Greg and Rachels relationship. The film is so comfortable with its chunks of gold it doesnt mind not spending them all. Any pic that can introduce Offerman and Britton in roles that play to their strengths then leave them out of most of the movie without causing viewers to complain is doing something right elsewhere. (Molly Shannon as Rachels boozed-up oversharing mother gets more scenes and is as ideal for them as Offerman and Britton.) The toughness of leukemia treatment is touched on during Gregs daily visits to Rachels house but never dominates the films mood. When the issue becomes impossible to ignore Gomez-Rejon shifts gears adeptly without losing his fascination with the ways these kids entertain themselves and each other. The whole thing after all is a book Greg is writing and after years of making little joke films he didnt want anyone but Earl to see hes finally done something that demands to be shared.

But (for its first half anyway) ""Me and Earl"" also reminded me of some of my favorite dryly whimsical Sundance movies like ""Submarine"" (2011) and ""Youth in Revolt"" (2010). Both of those films struck me as like Wes Anderson without the megadoses of twee. The first person of the title is Greg (a wonderful Thomas Mann) a lonely upper-middle-class white high schooler whose only friend Earl (RJ Cyler) is a black kid who lives in a rough neighborhood and has much less patience for all things shy and indirect than his buddy. The two of them watch Werner Herzog movies on their lunch break in the company of a hip history teacher (Jon Bernthal) and in their spare time make short parodies of film-school curriculum mainstays Theres ""The 400 Bros"" and ""Senior Citizen Kane"" and ""A Sockwork Orange."" Everybodys talkin about their ""258 P.M Cowboy."" Actually nobodys talkin about these two mismatched geeks and Gregs odd parents a professor (Nick Offerman) with a fondness for bizarre foreign food and an Olympic-class nag artist (Connie Britton) arent helping him adapt to his surroundings. Greg despairs that college will be even worse because he wont know anyone there. His shyness gets shattered by one of his moms carpet-bombing nag sessions though She insists that he pay a visit to a classmate (Olivia Cooke) he barely knows who has just been diagnosed with leukemia. Rachel the classmate isnt interested in the pity of a random classmate but in a line typical of this very funny movies ability to find humor in unexpected places Greg says ""Im not here because I pity you. Im here because my mom is making me."" Okay maybe you can call the rest of the movie from here on out. So what? The execution is what matters and the easy camaraderie of the two leads the inventiveness of Earl and Gregs movie spoofs (seen in hilarious snippets) the sharpness of the dialogue and the performances of Mann and Cooke not only make it all work they make it all sublime. I hinted above that ""Me and Earl"" lacks some of the more irritating and meretricious aspects of ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and that indie quality is what may stop the movie from being the huge hit it deserves to be. Despite its familiar and crowd-pleasing shape this movie plays to an audience that gets a joke about what Werner Herzogs college application might have sounded like. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" flattered its audience and told them they were smart; ""Me and Earl"" simply assumes its audience is smart. Well see how that works out. In the meantime mark down Cooke and Mann for stardom. The first-rate writer Jesse Andrews (whose script is based on his own novel) and the wry but sensitive director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon will be very busy as well.

Anyone who buys a ticket to a film called ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" goes in fully expecting to cry. Its sort of a given. The surprise then is the laughter the near-constant stream of wise insightful jokes that make it so easy to cozy up to characters dealing with a tough emotional situation. The story of a high-school senior forced to befriend a classmate who has just been diagnosed with leukemia and the sincere nonsexual connection that forms as a result (sorry ""The Fault in Our Stars"" but theres no nookie here) this rousing adaptation of Jesse Andrews novel is destined not only to connect with young audiences in a big way but also to endure as a touchstone for its generation. After landing a coveted spot on the 2012 Black List the coveted assignment went to director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon who worked as a personal assistant to Martin Scorsese shot second unit on such films as ""Babel"" and ""Argo"" and oversaw 20 episodes of ""Glee"" and ""American Horror Story"" for producer Ryan Murphy. Despite all that experience theres nothing jaded about his approach here which balances the new-toy giddiness of a first-timer (this is actually his second feature) with the wisdom of restraint in key areas. As such he pushes the envelope with his dynamic camerawork and framing but pulls back where others might have gone heavy downplaying the sentimentality and music (from Brian Eno). Premiering to a standing ovation at the Sundance Film Festival ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" is the kind of movie that gives the Utah-based sprocket opera its sterling reputation among budding cinephiles -- those who associate Sundance with films that defy formulas take risks and resonate on a deeper level than the studio-made stuff they grew up on. Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann) is just the type of teenager who appreciates such movies. Maybe thats why he struggles with the best way to narrate it. His isnt the first ""Im with cancer"" story to come along in recent years although this one doesnt want to jerk tears. Rather Gomez-Rejon and Andrews are determined to earn them -- and they do by making us care about the characters starting with Greg. Hes a familiar enough guy played by a normal-looking actor (you might recognize Mann from ""Project X"") with all the awkwardness we all feel in high school. Gregs coping mechanism is to make superficial friendships with all the different social cliques in school. Hes good at telling people what they want to hear but not so great at real human interaction as evidenced by the fact he refers to his best friend Earl (RJ Cyler) as his ""co-worker."" The duo spend hours together everyday studying and making short-film parodies of classic movies most of which even dedicated film majors dont discover until college. (With titles like ""A Sockwork Orange"" and ""Pooping Tom"" theyre all terrible but thats sort of the joke one that astoundingly never gets old.) As hobbies go such amateur filmmaking is designed to spare Greg the hassle of actually having to interact with his peers. Hes especially terrified of girls which makes the request from his mother (Connie Britton) to visit Rachel (Olivia Cooke) a particularly challenging one. Since the movie is committed to approaching this task with as much humor as possible Gomez-Rejon casts Molly Shannon as Rachels mom who surely would have reminded underage Greg of ""The Graduates"" Mrs. Robinson if only he had ventured out a bit farther than the Criterion Collection (which gets primo placement throughout). Rachel doesnt have any more interest in receiving pity than Greg does in doling it out which explains how the two kids who would never be friends under normal circumstances manage to shift the focus to other things. Turns out Gregs a pretty funny guy (those punny movie titles notwithstanding) and as you probably guessed he stands to gain at least as much from these interactions as she does. Still it takes Earls involvement to nudge the conversations into more personal territory -- although hes been plenty candid with us since the beginning. Finding Gregs voice must have been the hardest thing for Andrews whose eloquent adaptation of his own novel could have turned out wildly different in the hands of another helmer -- like Gus Van Sant who took a more twee approach with his even more ""Harold and Maude""-indebted terminal-teen drama ""Restless."" Meanwhile compared with last summers ""The Fault in Our Stars"" which Josh Boone directed with almost no sense of personal style ""Girl"" practically erupts with technique The camera hardly ever sits still offering odd wide-angle perspectives and panning in big self-conscious maneuvers with nearly every shot. Such a flashy approach comes at enormous risk obviously since it draws attention to all the clever surface choices when we should really be trying to focus on the connections being made onscreen. But it also seems to fit a character who is himself an aspiring filmmaker. And it makes the few scenes in which Korean d.p. Chung-hoon Chung (""Stoker"") holds steady and lingers on Greg and Rachel all the more effective. There are two scenes in particular where the jokes cease and these two fragile humans are allowed to reveal their true emotions which serve to define the movie in place of all those showy moments when the camera is busy rotating sideways as Greg walks to school or following him from the living room upstairs in one elaborately choreographed gesture. Still Gomez-Rejons tricks should help distinguish the film in the minds of those young viewers impressed by such innovative flourishes. The same could be said for a few of the more eccentric supporting roles including Gregs father (Nick Offerman playing a culturally curious version of his usually brusque self) and heavily tattooed history teacher Mr. McCarthy (Jon Bernthal). As Earl newcomer Cyler stands out as well evolving from comic relief to a sort of conscience figure as the relationship between Greg and Rachel deepens. Its refreshing to see that bond flourish as something platonic (romantically speaking Greg is more interested in another classmate played by Katherine Hughes) which also allows the film to depict Rachels deterioration in a realistic way. There are plenty of young actresses who wouldnt dare to be seen bald and a whole other group who would have made a big fuss of it but Cooke approaches the role with quiet dignity. And yet none of this would have worked had the team not found the right Greg. The story demands someone with enough insight into other peoples personalities that he can size them up in an instant but not so much that he comes off as a jerk. Blending wit and modesty Mann fits the bill coming across as an overgrown kid with a good heart but virtually no practice in relating to others -- which is perhaps the thing that makes his experience so profoundly relatable.
