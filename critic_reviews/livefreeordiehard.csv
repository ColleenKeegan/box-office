Frank Masi/Twentieth Century Fox Director Len WisemanGenre Action ComedyRunning Time 130 minutes (requires RealPlayer) Bruce Willis working-class cop probably isnt the first guy youd turn to if you knew youd be battling a gang of computer creeps -- hes so tech-challenged he doesnt even carry a cell phone -- but if hes already engaged when the battle starts its helpful to have him in your corner. His first encounter in a decade with megalomaniacal geniuses involves a doomsday scheme in which a team of computer hackers brings the U.S. to its knees. Its not remotely plausible but with Willis McClane leaping onto the tailfins of passing jet fighters and bringing down helicopters by launching police cars at them theres enough stuff blowing up that action fans wont mind much. Providing an invaluable assist A geeky hacker type (Justin Long doing a pretty hilarious variation on his ""Hi Im a Mac"" persona) who becomes McClanes inadvertent comic sidekick.

Comments Live Free or Die Hard Twelve years after the third entry in the action franchise about unstoppable New York maverick cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) a steely computer genius (Timothy Olyphant the seriess weakest villain so far) has crippled Washington D.C. by breaching the nations vital data banks. McClane enlists a Jersey hacker (Justin Long the Mac guy from the Apple ads) to reverse the damage but the bad guys omnipotence at nearly every turn dilutes the films suspense. The physical stunts by Maggie Q as a lethal martial arts expert and Cyril Raffaelli as a Eurotrash sniper who rappels down buildings are more thrilling than the over-the-top chase sequences so contrived as to verge on self-parody. Len Wiseman (Underworld) directed. PG-13 129 min.

The first Die Hard was a B-movie masterpiece of spatial containment but a great many fireballs have passed under the bridge since then and the series has sprawled usually too much for its own good. Live Free or Die Hard gets a bit of the old mojo back by tapping into fears that are by nature too virtual to see. The terrorist played by Timothy Olyphant (is it intentional that hes been styled to look like an android?) is a former government cyber-spook who attempted to demonstrate U.S. vulnerability after 9/11 and was pilloried for his efforts. Now hes going to prove it all over again this time for maximum chaos and profit. He whips up a Y2K-style national meltdown hacking into the countrys security systems traffic grids and God knows what else. As McClane dives down elevator shafts leaps out of the way of falling cars and generally behaves like the scarred and wisecracking human bullet he is the whole drive of the audience is to see him burst through the fourth wall of computer technology so he can confront the bad guys on his own bare-knuckle terms. I wish Willis had been given a few funnier lines but his Bogart-with-a-smirk charisma has aged gracefully. At its best Live Free or Die Hard is an enjoyable pop projection of post-9/11 anxiety. That said it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didnt have to deal with it.

The word is ""genial."" Not genial as in cheerful though Pixars latest animated feature is certainly that but genial with an accent as in brilliant or inspired. The characters are irresistible -- why would anyone want to resist a hero who so gallantly transcends his rattiness? -- the animation is astonishing and the film a fantasy version of a foodie rhapsody sustains a level of joyous invention that hasnt been seen in family entertainment since ""The Incredibles."" ENLARGE The uncommon denominator of both productions is Brad Bird the writer-director-cum-field marshal who once again has led an army of artists and technicians in the making of a film that feels both personal and classic. Theres the same unerring showmanship which makes a complex story seem luminously logical the same delight in hurtling motion sophisticated comedy (which flatters kids and grownups alike) and copious detail. Instead of using the kitchen of a fancy French restaurant as a picturesque background ""Ratatouille"" explores the workplace and its frenzied rituals -- as well as its intricate hierarchy -- with a screwball zest worthy of the sainted Julia Child. And Remy slices dices and cooks with thrilling ingenuity that overcomes his dual deficits in standing and stature. But is the world ready for a movie that sees an upwardly mobile rodent in a kitchen as a cause for celebration rather than extermination? Once youve met the clean little rat in question and registered the high preposterousness of the premise -- not to mention the elegance of the execution -- the answer is yes. Remy is a born foodie ""If you are what you eat I only want to eat the good stuff."" And hes a dreamer who uses his highly refined sniffer to follow his bliss. What makes him so endearing though -- and surely winning to kids -- is that hes a quintessential outcast an underrat whos first reviled by the very people who come to lionize him. When Pixar Animation Studios released ""The Incredibles"" in 2004 the company served notice that its computer animation techniques could rival or excel much of the action in live-action movies. Now Pixar as part of Disney has taken those techniques to new heights of virtuosity -- and new depths during a vertiginous ride through the City of Lights sewers. (Although the complexities of fluid dynamics have posed formidable problems for animators the results here are so convincing that you wonder if they cheated by pouring water into their computers.) ""Ratatouilles"" tour de force sequence turns on a partnership between Remy and the restaurants dishwasher a clueless gangly kid named Linguini. The rat cooks by remote control as he rides like a cross between a puppeteer and a mahout inside Linguinis toque. Their wild dance is repeated a bit too often but its the funniest thing of its kind since Steve Martins body was possessed by Lily Tomlins spirit in ""All Of Me."" The cast of characters is large remarkably varied and wonderfully voiced especially Ian Holms Skinner the restaurants dwarfish dictatorial head chef; Janeane Garofalos Colette a feminist chef with a passion to succeed in a milieu dominated by men and Peter OTooles Anton Ego a food critic of vulpine physique and acidulous demeanor. Anton is as you might guess an insufferable esthete but he is also bless his caustic soul eager for new experiences. And so it falls to him to taste and savor the vegetable dish of the movies title in a moment of comic revelation that is nothing short of sublime. Sicko When the government stripped Mr. Incredible of his superhero status in ""The Incredibles"" he was reduced to working in the claims department of an HMO where his job was to deny claims. His testimony would have been a worthy addition to ""Sicko"" though Michael Moores argumentative blogumentary about health care is shockingly funny -- and sometimes genuinely shocking -- without him. Mr. Moore sees the United States as a nation in denial so much so that weve slipped to number 37 in a World Health Organization ranking just ahead of Slovenia. Lashing out with Swiftian scorn at a system that leaves almost 50 million Americans uninsured he finds ample reason for outrage in scarifying stories told not only by the uninsured but by those whose insurance companies failed or betrayed them. Just as Al Gore did with global warming in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" he frames the health care crisis in moral and ethical terms. ""Who are we?"" he asks. ""Is this what weve become?"" One might also ask whats new here. Coming at a time when Americas health care system is being scrutinized and debated as never before ""Sicko"" covers familiar ground. Yet the question misses the point for the movies appeal lies at the intersection of its timing and style. Precisely because our concerns about health care have become so immediate and because the production package is so entertaining the shrewdly titled ""Sicko"" may help stimulate the debate. But -- and yes with a Michael Moore film there is always a but -- the filmmaker cant leave ill enough alone. With hardly a nod toward critical thinking he represents the universal health care systems in Canada Britain and France as essentially flawless through the use of ardent interview subjects extravagant praise and slippery rhetorical devices. And the claims he makes for those countries are positively modest in comparison to his discovery of health-care heaven in Cuba (which happens to be 39th in that W.H.O. ranking a fact that can be gleaned from a fleeting close-up of the list but one thats never mentioned in the course of the film). Its bitterly funny when the filmmaker seeks treatment for a group of chronically ill Sept. 11 rescue volunteers by taking them on a boat to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay where he contends Al Qaeda prisoners get better medical care than mainland Americans. Yet its embarrassing when the jaunty provocateur turns earnest propagandist and sails off with his ad hoc wards to Havana where doctors and nurses are happy to minister to their new patients on camera. (Its also embarrassing that our Treasury Department has put Mr. Moore under investigation for possible violations of the trade embargo against Cuba.) Lots of ""Sicko"" stands as boffo political theater but its major domo lost me by losing his sense of humor. Live Free or Die Hard Dont judge ""Live Free or Die Hard"" by its title which sounds like a license-plate motto or make snide assumptions as I did about the impending death of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. John McClane the New York cop played by Bruce Willis may be long in the tooth but he hasnt lost his bite. This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment and startlingly shrewd in the bargain a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh as you gape at their thunderous extravagance. ENLARGE Bruce Willis returns as police detective John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. The film was directed by Len Wiseman from a smart fluent script by Mark Bomback. The plot involves a cyber plot -- a computer-based attack against American institutions particularly financial institutions on a scale so vast that the good guys (at the FBI) as well as the bad guys (in a mobile facility that looks like a Best Buy showroom) call the concerted attack a Fire Sale -- ""everything goes."" And the shrewdest part of the film is its teaming of the creaky (but buff) McClane whos derided by a baddie as a ""Timex in a digital age"" with a young computer whiz named Matt Farrell; hes played by Justin Long the casually charming actor who embodies the cool Mac in those Apple commercials that make fun of Microsofts Windows. (Timothy Olyphant gives another strong performance as the Fire Sales mastermind Gabriel.) The Macs cool carries over but ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" warms it up by putting it in a moral context; Matt must redeem himself however frightened by the danger he may be because he wrote the mutating encryption algorithm -- Im just quoting from my notes -- that gave the Fire Sale program its basic structure. All of this is an elaborate excuse of course for the taciturn John McClane to take endless punishment in the course of saving civilization while kung fu fighters fight a Harrier jump jet harries an 18-wheeler and a cop car goes airborne to bring a chopper down. Good for him and for us.    DVD TIP Ive recommended it before but I keep meeting parents and kids who havent heard of ""The Iron Giant"" (1999). Brad Birds debut feature about a boy and his alien robot isnt on a par with ""The Incredibles"" or ""Ratatouille"" -- how could it be and what is? -- but the film is pretty great in its own right.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 29 2007 Save for later Saved ""Live Free or Die Hard"" - the fourth ""Die Hard"" movie and the first in a decade - is easily the best in the series since the first one. Although it has its fair share of computer-generated effects an alarming number of the stunts and explosions seem real and the entire enterprise is character-driven rather than machine-tooled.Bruce Williss New York City detective John McClane is cynical and divorced with a college-age daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who barely speaks to him. Hes handed the routine assignment of transporting a young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) to Washington D.C. for questioning by Federal authorities. Its not long before McClane is once again in his element Bullets spray SUVs do back flips on the highway helicopters zoom in for the kill.The perpetrator of the fun and games is Washington renegade Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) who aims to shut down the entire digital infrastructure of America by engineering what in geekspeak is known as a ""fire sale"" - everything must go. As the plan rolls out and panic ensues McClane with Farrell in tow hustles to stay ahead of the terror. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? As opposed to most smash-and-burn sequels this one actually has a good idea going for it McClane represents the old-school analog world Gabriel stands for the digital. Most thrillers now are so high-tech that its almost mandatory for the protagonists to be computer geniuses and so theres something inherently funny about a modern action movie hero who doesnt know beans about computers. McClane must rely on Farrell to survive but the opposite is also true. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is a celebration of analog brawniness over digital finesse. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Len Wiseman and screenwriter Mark Bomback keep the action coming almost nonstop and yet the movie is never tiring because the set pieces are all different from one another. Even the fighting plays out the analog versus digital theme In the best of the fighting scenes brawler McClane and a sleek kung fu bad girl (Maggie Q) practically embody yin and yang.In a movie with so much destruction set over the the 4th of July weekend in New York and Washington D.C. - at one point the White House appears to have been detonated - its unavoidable that 9/11 references abound. The filmmakers havent quite solved the problem - no one has yet - of how to make a popcorn political thriller about domestic terrorism without putting out bad vibes. Although he quotes from Lenin Gabriel is ultimately just a bland-faced bad guy in the James Bond villain mold and yet the film summons up imagery and fears that are all too real.But at least for the running time of the movie we have nothing to worry about; John McClane can take anybody down. Grade A- Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action language and a brief sexual situation.

"Live Free or Die Hard | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; live-free-or-die-hard ) Live Free or Die Hard (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli After twelve years haunting the shelves of video stores John McClane (Bruce Willis) has been exhumed. The indefatigable hero of three Die Hard films during the 1980s and 1990s appeared to have reached his ""sell by"" expiration date with the lackluster Die Hard with a Vengeance but Fox decided there was still room for the old school cop in the digital age. So John McClane is back - sort of. For although this guy looks like McClane sounds like McClane cracks wise like McClane says ""Yippee kiyay"" like McClane and gets bloody like McClane he doesnt always seem like McClane. Instead of an everyday guy getting the crap kicked out of him as he soldiers on to save his family this guy is a superhero without the costume. If we as the movie-going public werent so obsessed with familiar faces there would be no Live Free or Die Hard. Take away Bruce Willis and this is straight-to-video material. The filmmakers fixed one mistake of Die Hard with a Vengeance but left two in play. This time John is again fighting for a loved one although now its daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) instead of wife Holly whose only appearance in this movie is via a still photograph. Unfortunately the film forgets that the Die Hard formula works best in confined spaces and has John zipping all across the East Coast with stops in Camden (New Jersey) Baltimore Washington D.C. and West Virginia. Worse the lone wolf has been saddled with a partner. If it didnt work when the sidekick was Samuel L. Jackson hows it going to work when that guy is Justin Long the dweeb forever known as Mac from the Apple TV ads? The story goes something like this a cyberterrorist Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is about to unleash Armageddon on the United States. As in all Die Hard movies his motives are purely financial (only William Sadler in Die Hard 2 had a noble cause). He has a sexy henchwoman Mai Lihn (Maggie Q) whose leg kicks are high enough to earn her an instant spot with the Rockettes. Meanwhile our hero is at Rutgers upsetting his daughter by interfering with her date and threatening to do nasty things to her would-be boyfriend if he rounds first base. Thats when John gets the call - head to Camden to pick up hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) and bring him to D.C. for questioning. Unfortunately Johns not the only one who wants Matt. Gabriel wants him in little pieces - he knows too much. John arrives just in time to get involved in shootouts car chases and really big explosions. Eventually when Gabriel gets tired of having an annoying New York City cop systematically whittle down his fighting force he decides to even the score by kidnapping Lucy. Director Len Wiseman at times forgets that hes directing a Die Hard movie not another Underworld installment. Color desaturation might work well with vampires and werewolves but its not a great enhancement to McClanes world. Also while the action sequences are assembled with workmanlike efficiency they skate past preposterousness into the realm of outright silliness. Ill buy John jumping off the roof of an exploding building with a fire hose as a tether but playing chicken in an 18-wheeler with a fighter plane while double-decker highways pancake all around him? Yippee kiyay indeed. The character of Matt Farrell is a major annoyance and more than one audience member will wish that Gabriel would hit the mark and leave John on his own. Long isnt right for the part - hes too closely associated with the TV commercials (and in an instance of ""clever"" product placement the computer Farrell uses is a Mac) - but the writers exacerbate the situation by making him an irritating whiner. John may be a fly in the ointment but Farrell is an albatross around the flys neck. As the head villain Timothy Olyphant isnt the best bad guy in the Die Hard series (hands down thats Alan Rickmans Hans Gruber). In fact hes not even the best bad guy in this film. That would be Maggie Q whose role as a henchwoman ensures she wont be around for the finale. Then theres Kevin Smith. Whats he doing here anyway besides sticking out like a sore thumb? There is one bit of casting the movie got right - Mary Elizabeth Winstead who had the lead in Final Destination 3 is great as Lucy. In my dream version of Live Free or Die Hard she would have teamed up with Dad and things would have gotten a lot more interesting. In some ways Live Free or Die Hard is the perfect summer movies there are lots of explosions the action verges on maniacal it takes an act of God to kill a character (whether good or bad) and the running length tops two hours. The movie generates some excitement and releases the occasional burst of adrenaline but at times it feels more like a big-screen episode of 24 than another Die Hard. Johns one-liners have become as mechanical as his methods. There are times when the old John peeks out from inside The TerMcClaneter and we smile but those moments are too few. Much has also been made about the PG-13 rating but thats a red herring. This film is as violent as its predecessors and the profane part of the tag line is still there. In fact its a wonder that the MPAA allowed this to pass without an R. When it comes to pure turn-off-the-brain action Live Free or Die Hard delivers and its at least a little less burdensome in doing so than any of the summer of 2007s other to-date blockbusters. While it would be nice to trumpet that John McClane has returned in triumph that would be a lie. Twelve years is a long time between sequels and while it can be said that absence makes the heart grow fonder this length of absence encourages forgetfulness. Bringing back John after all those years might have made sense if the script was great but this is pyrotechnics 101 with a side order of computer-geek-speak. Strangely enough Live Free or Die Hard may work better for an audience that doesnt know much about the series is than it will for Die Hard die hards who will be wondering who that impersonator is and what he did with the real John McClane. The original Die Hard came out of nowhere to blitz the 1988 summer box office. The fourth installment arrives with a weight of expectations that Atlas would have trouble shouldering and when the dust settles in September its unlikely that Live Free or Die Hard will be one of this years big success stories.

Related How Bruce Willis Keeps His Cool Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME I dont recall by what cracked narrative logic the SUV got into the elevator shaft although its perfectly clear why John McClane (Bruce Willis) and bad gal Mai (Maggie Q) are fighting to the death as they cling to the tottering vehicle-because all of us (the filmmakers the audience) really want them to. I mean why would you put a sexy mystery woman into Live Free or Die Hard if not bring her into conflict with its weary but still nicely toned hero and witness the slender beauty and the rudely wise-cracking beast battle each other. Its nice clean sado-masochism that doesnt endanger the blessed PG-13 rating. Still its a pretty good sequence in a movie thats full of pretty good--if insanely improbable--sequences including one high point moment in which a car driven by Willis manages to knock a malevolently hovering helicopter right out of the air. Realism is not shall we say high on the list of director Len Wisemans priorities. At the screening I attended you could sense the audiences adrenaline pumping and then hear the applause burst forth when Willis and his computer nerd buddy Matt Farrell (the very cute Justin Long) escaped from assorted largely fiery villainies on a regular--say every ten minutes or so--basis. The bad guys in this instance are led by a rogue computer genius named Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) who has been shabbily treated by the federal government. He intends to get his revenge by hacking into every computer-run system in the country beginning with the transportation grid and ending with the financial system from which he intends to drain every last penny before hes finished. His scheme is called a ""fire sale"" (as in ""everything must go"") and of course it will make him rich. But thats not the point; the point is revenge. The central joke of the movie-and its not a bad one-is that it takes a rogue cop (McClane) to catch a rogue mastermind nevermind the fact that McClane is so obviously computer illiterate. Its hard to imagine him owning a PC let alone cruising the Internet in search of blog tidbits or pornish delights. But if he did we can only imagine him picking up a computer and hurling it to the floor when for some reason he had trouble paying bills online or balancing his checkbook. In other words his short-tempered everyman has been dragged snarling and fretful into the computer age and theres some fun to be had from him. McClane has--in addition--a bad relationship with his daughter which the movie eventually repairs and a funny one with Farrell who emerges from his first car chase complaining of a skinned knee and a potential asthma attack. Naturally Farrell toughens up considerably by the time the last fireball blasts past his ear. Could the movie have used a few more grumbly witticisms from McClane? Absolutely. Could Mark Bombacks script have been more probable? Sure. Are we perhaps getting a little tired of movies over-loaded with high-tech gear whirring numbers on multiple screens and the barking of incomprehensible instructions to the techies tapping away at their keyboards? I think so. But thats not why were at the theater watching Live Free. Were there to be rendered breathless by the stunts and the CGI tricks which are admirably managed. And for the films relentless one-damn-thing-after-another pacing. In its primitiveness its refusal of anything like psychological nuance or big ideas lies its dubious glory. It is a movie born to be forgotten-except as something that against your better judgment you had a pretty good time watching back in the summer of 07. Which is more than you can say for other elephantine sequels moping dolorously around us this year.

At major theatres. 14A The point is John McClane is back and as usual up to his neck in trouble he didnt ask for and doesnt want.I say ""as usual"" though in fact the iconic action figure was fairly ill served in the first and second sequels to the surprise 1988 hit Die Hard (despite being surrounded by supportive Canadians Sheila McCarthy in Die Hard 2 Die Harder and Graham Greene in Die Hard With a Vengeance).It wasnt the remarkably consistent Bruce Willis - for whom lets face it this wisecracking role has never really been much of a stretch - as much as it was what he was required to do and to whom and with whom and for whom.I am pleased to report that with the what and who this time more or less equal to the task sequel number three Live Free or Die Hard is indeed a worthy successor to the original - not perhaps quite as good but close.Article Continued BelowWell start with whats wrong with it and work our way back if only because thats what McClane the eternal pessimist would do.The action set-pieces though spectacularly staged by director Len Wiseman (Underworld Evolution) are derivative even of themselves - there are so many cars propelled into the air that the movie at times starts to resemble another Bruce Willis flying-car flick The Fifth Element. Theres an athletic foot chase right out of Casino Royale a truck explosion a la Terminator and a mano-a-womano fight to the death that looks like a declawed outtake from the second X-Men. (I would give its elevator-shaft setting some points had there not been so much elevator action in the original.) Then there is the central villain a standard set impossibly high by the incomparable Alan Rickman in the original Die Hard here assayed comparatively blandly by Deadwoods Timothy Olyphant as a button-down uber-patriot who wants to bring the country down to save it attacking its transportation communications and defence electronically - what is known in terrorist terms as a ""fire sale"" as in ""everything must go."" To that end he has employed - and then summarily executed - the countrys leading computer hackers. All except two not coincidentally representing the movies cleverest casting calls the TV-commercial Apple shill Justin Long and the director and occasional actor Kevin Smith.Both will prove invaluable in this technological war that an outdated McClane finds himself uniquely unprepared for - although if I ever hear anyone again utter the phrase ""analog man in a digital world"" I will be forced to shove their tongue into the nearest USB port.Long is a competent cowering foil to McClanes gonzo el destructo man of action. But because his being protected from harm is nowhere near the kind of stakes that bring out the best - and thus the worst - in McClane the emotional ante is upped by the abduction of his now college-age daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead from Grindhouse).Which brings us back to Willis his irreverently exasperated charms undiminished and indeed enhanced by the passage of almost two decades.Hes back.

Live Free or Die Hard Movie Review (2007) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/live-free-or-die-hard,200,livefreeordiehard13,livefreeordiehard,rogerebert
"A comedy of Yankee errors - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW A comedy of Yankee errors Aaron Stanford plays John ""Rugged"" Rudgate a small-town ""gangsta"" at the center of this crime comedy set in New Hampshire. (Think Film Co.) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  March 30 2007 ""Live Free or Die"" has picked up some brutal reviews from other critics around the country (""criminally short on laughs"" Variety ). Thats probably because theyve never been to New Hampshire.If you have been to that fine state immediately to our north -- better yet if youve escaped -- this crime comedy will have the squalid bitterly funny ring of truth. Like a 1972 Dodge thats been up on blocks in a front yard off a state highway ""Live Free"" takes an awfully long time to start up. Its timing isnt great either but it gets you to the state liquor store and thats what counts.Aaron Stanford (""Tadpole "" the ""X-Men "" movies) is intentionally miscast as John ""Rugged"" Rudgate  the scourge of Rutland N.H. (played convincingly by the town of Claremont  just over the border from Vermont). His legend precedes and overshadows him; in reality hes a shrimp a coward and a motormouth. Hes not even a criminal since the ""hot"" speakers he sells from the back of his rusted blue van have been legally purchased.Rugged would die of shame if you knew that though since he aims to be the baddest mother in the state. Hes got the New Hampshire gangsta look -- knit hat at least three shirts tattered parka -- and he claims to have killed a logger or two. When he runs into a thick-witted high school acquaintance named Jeff (Paul Schneider ) who just inherited a self-storage facility Rugged spies a chance to get a piece of the action.First though he has to prove his manliness against a local Bluto (R.E. Rodgers ) which results in a sequence of mishaps that include murder breaking and entering and the theft of vintage pornography. Events dont escalate in ""Live Free and Die"" so much as devolve in a slow-motion daisy chain of ineptitude. To do something right would probably mean youre from Connecticut.Stanford is amusing as this preposterous wannabe -- a Yorkie trying to act like a pit bull -- but Schneider makes the part of the heros sidekick into something special. Always a half beat behind the rest of the characters hes like Art Carney stuck in molasses. As Jeffs sister Zooey Deschanel ambles through a few scenes and immediately raises the films IQ by 50 points.The minor characters are hit-and-miss. Michael Rapaport cant do much with the underwritten part of a jealous policeman but Ebon Moss-Bachrach is unsettling as a local thug of the sort Rugged aspires to be and Judah Friedlander (""American Splendor "") is truly sleazy as a hardware store proprietor. From his greasy muttonchops to his imitation Stephen King horn-rims he captures a very particular Granite State retail truculence. I bought a used car from this guy once and I got hosed.""Live Free or Die"" -- named for New Hampshires motto which is stamped onto state license plates by prison inmates -- has been written and directed by former ""Seinfeld"" writers Gregg Kavet and Andy Robin . The film has the same sense of dryly observed entropy as the shows final episode the one that angered the faithful by stranding Jerry and company in a small Massachusetts town.Kavet and Robin just set the inaction a little farther north in the land of no taxes and less hope. Clearly theyre hoping for another ""Fargo"" but they dont even make it across the river to Bellows Falls . This isnt a great movie -- its barely good really -- but it gets something about New Hampshire Ive rarely seen onscreen a defiant pride in the way things dont work out. ""Live Free"" is a comedy of vastly diminished criminal expectations. Thats the fun of it and the frustration too.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Live Free or Die Hard reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Live Free or Die Hard reviewed. Live Free or Die Hard reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateSummer MoviesThe joy of blockbusters.June 26 2007 718 PM Real American Hero The analog awesomeness of Live Free or Die Hard. By Dana Stevens Read more from Slates Summer Movies. Bruce Willis as John McClane Midway through Live Free or Die Hard (20th Century Fox) someone tells Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) ""Youre a Timex watch in a digital age."" Its a nearly identical line to one uttered in Oceans Thirteen to George Clooney and Brad Pitt and like that movie the fourth installment of Die Hard is a nostalgic tribute to an earlier age of Hollywood filmmaking. But whereas Oceans Thirteen stylishly saluted the Vegas heist picture Live Free or Die Hard dispenses with the style It brings back 80s action filmmaking through sheer muscle. This is a movie that believes in doing things the old-fashioned way hurling real cars at real helicopters and dangling real SUVs down real elevator shafts. Sure theres computer-generated enhancement but only as much as necessary to keep those hurtling vehicles from killing the equally real (and certifiable) stuntmen and women who agree to climb behind their wheels. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its been nearly 20 years since Bruce Willis appeared as John McClane in the original Die Hard and 12 years since the third installment Die Hard With a Vengeance in which he saved New York from Jeremy Irons. In the first chapter of the franchise since 9/11--hell the first chapter since Clintons first term in office--the stakes are considerably higher. The requisite evildoer computer genius Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) wants to shut down the entire countrys telecommunications utilities and financial infrastructure in a three-part digital attack known as a ""fire sale"" (because ""everything must go""). Gabriels motives--do you really need to know? Theres anti-government paranoia involved (Lenin is quoted at one point) and of course billions of dollars to be moved into Gabriels bank account from well everyone elses but essentially the guy is just an asshole. To make sure his scheme is bug-proof Gabriel hires a bunch of freelance hackers--basically nerds in basements--and once theyve served his purpose picks them off with extreme prejudice. Advertisement On a routine errand to pick up one of the suspected hackers a New Jersey kid named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) McClane finds the boy and himself targeted by a pair of French assassins who appear to be practitioners of parkour. Thus begins a jolly chase in which McClane and Matt pursued by international villains airborne cars and at one point a Harrier jet make their way toward the top-secret NSA facility thats become Gabriels command center. Theres so much violence noise and mayhem in Live Free or Die Hard that the overall effect is strangely Zen (just as the din in Times Square can be so deafening sometimes that it resolves into a gentle hum). Though the movies at least 20 minutes too long its deeply satisfying full of old-school buddy banter and the kind of action sequences that make you burst out laughing at their sheer audacity. In the Die Hard world the human body--particularly Bruce Willis all-too-human 55-year-old body--is not so much flesh and bone as a vulcanized rubber projectile. Ignoring the current trend toward hyperrealist gore director Len Wiseman (Underworld) never shows us the real-life results of say being thrown from a fast-moving vehicle There are no severed limbs no faces ground to hamburger. Instead the combatants ignore their manly well-placed lacerations and brush themselves off for the next round. I suppose this approach is mind-corroding in its own way minimizing the effects of violence and so on but its a relief to get through two hours without any exploding heads or flying organs. Live Free or Die Hard is like the pretend play of a child banging Matchbox cars together imagining the physics of midair collision for the sheer glee of it. One bravura chase sequence inside a tunnel garnered a round of applause at the screening I attended. An even more absurd scene in which McClane leaps from a collapsing highway onto the back of a fighter jet in midflight recalled the ending of Dr. Strangelove--if Slim Pickens had survived his bronco ride on the missile. The Die Hard movies belong so completely to Bruce Willis his indestructible physique and world-weary way with a one-liner that it seems almost spurious to mention the rest of the cast. But Justin Long who looks like a smarter Keanu Reeves is endearing as the slacker sidekick who carries his messenger bag even into the jaws of doom. Timothy Olyphant as the sneering supervillain projects a somewhat generic malice but the kung-fu star Maggie Q as his ice-queen girlfriend dies almost as hard as McClane and looks fabulous doing it. Director Kevin Smith does a funny eleventh-hour cameo as a chubby computer whiz called the Warlock. Live Free or Die Hard lacks any single wisecrack as deathless as McClanes trademark ""yippee-ki-yay motherfucker"" (which he tosses off here at one point the offending F-word cut off by a gunshot to preserve the PG-13 rating). But it has enough mind-blowing stunts to leave audience members walking out and inventing obscenity-laced catchphrases of their own. On that topic ... its been nearly a year since the last SlateMovies contest in which more than 700 readers contributed fake movie titles inspired by Snakes on a Plane with brilliant results. In honor of the Summer Movies issue I hereby propose a contest for the best fake action-movie one-liner (required reading Eric Lichtenfelds well-considered analysis of the Die Hard catchphrase). Your entry neednt be profanity-laced (though it can be)--just make it snappy and memorable the kind of thing youd love to say right before blowing a bad guy away. Send me your contributions by the evening of Monday July 2 and Ill post the results late next week. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Photo DIGITAL DIMENSION 20TH CENTURY FOX Live Free or Die Hard 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Early in Live Free or Die Hard New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) rescues a young computer hacker from a horde of assassins. After several assailants die the frightened youth (Justin Long) turns to McClane in shock. ""Have you done stuff like this before killing people?"" ""Yes"" says McClane ""but not for a long time."" Right on both counts. McClane dispatched killers by the bunch in the three previous Die Hard movies but since 1995 hes been busy with other things going bald giving up smoking learning to remove a certain 12-letter hyphenate from his vocabulary and spying on his dating daughter. Fortunately for McClane shooting head-butting absorbing punishment and cracking wise are like riding a bicycle. Set off a few explosions and automatic weapons it all comes back. Thats fortunate for us too. Live Free or Die Hard is the most creative and exciting Die Hard film since the original though its hardly the originals equal. For sheer fun original conception and tautness Die Hard -- picked by Entertainment Weekly recently as ""the Greatest Action Movie of All Time"" -- is tough to match. But LFoDH tries hard. In keeping with the series last two entries Die Hard 2 Die Harder (1990) and Die Hard With a Vengeance (1995) it is overlong and progressively cartoonish. More than ever McClane is now in the Batman ""human superhero"" mold. The size of the villains gang and scope of his evil plan have reached awesome absurdity. Hans Gruber used a gang of 12 to rob a skyscraper in Die Hard. That had grown to scores when Simon Gruber robbed Manhattan in Vengeance. For LFoDH preppie-looking Thomas Gabriel a disgruntled former U.S. intelligence computer expert has hundreds of baddies on call in his plot to shut down most of the United States. If you believe his declared purpose to warn the nation its vulnerable to an enemy then you havent been paying attention in earlier Die Hards. As McClane says its always about stealing money. Enter McClane. Hes no Sampson. Losing his hair just made him tougher. Watch close and you may spot a bit less speed and spring in this self-declared ""Energizer bun-ny"" but hes still bouncing up the ground and making hits like a linebacker the ultimate smart-aleck tough guy. The film directed by Len Wiseman (Underworld) has less talky dead time than the earlier films and the action stunts and visual effects are over the moon though the biggest one -- involving an 18-wheeler and a fighter plane -- goes from far-fetched to comedy. With Willis 52 pushing the modern action-hero age envelope the principal secondary characters are all youthful. Gabriel is played with calmly assured cockiness by Timothy Olyphant (Deadwood). More intriguing is his main assassin and lover Mai Lihn. Portrayed by Maggie Q (Mission Impossible III) she has a sleek sexual malevolence. She and McClane share a memorable confrontation that proves theyre both durable. Even getting smashed by a speeding SUV doesnt slow her down. Replacing McClanes wife his daughter Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is now the focus of the inevitable threat by the villains. She also supplies a love interest for the McClanes computer-hacker sidekick. While LFoDH adheres closely to the tone of the earlier films McClanes dome is not the only thing that has changed. Cigarette smoking is no longer cool nudity scares off parents and too much gore is frowned upon. If you really pay attention youll notice a slight toning down to get this movie the series first PG-13 which is now more profit-stable than an R rating. louis.parkschron.com Todays Deals Fruit of the Loom Mens Boxer Briefs 8-Pack for 12 + pickup...

Sunday June 24 2007 613 PM Live Free or Die Hard John McClane returns in this actioner that pits him against cyber-terrorists. With Bruce Willis Justin Long Timothy Olymphant. Director Len Wiseman (210). PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action language and a brief sexual situation. Photo gallery Live Free or Die Hard premiere If you think a 52-year-old Bruce Willis is too old to be falling out of planes hanging from an SUV driven into an industrial elevator or bracing himself in the back of a van about to be blown up no worries. Nothing in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" the belated fourth entry in the John McClane ""Die Hard"" series could or did happen. The action in this fast-paced hysterically overproduced and surprisingly entertaining film is as realistic as a Road Runner cartoon. But the work done by stuntmen - with heads shaved to match Willis - is amazing and the many action set pieces are choreographed with breath-taking efficiency by director Len Wiseman (""Underworld""). The fun of ""Live Free"" is surprising to me because I found nothing to like in the first three films least of all Willis look-at-me-Im-a-movie-star performances. But Willis has aged well and grown on me. Hes still saying ""Look at me"" but here he bears the weight and humility of age. The plot is a kind of queasy exploitation of 9/11. Seems that after that infamous date a computer wunderkind in the Department of Defense was convinced that America could be taken down by hackers but his concerns were dismissed and he made a career change to terrorist. Now hes figured out how to hack into the FBI database shut down transportation and communication systems and is finishing the third phase of operation Fire Sale - turning off the utilities. As before John McClane is inadvertently drawn in to the terrorist plot and compelled to solve the case and save the country. Working as a detective in Camden N.J. McClane is busy picking up a known hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) for questioning when some heavily armed French-speaking assassins try to kill them both. From then on its a chase film with multiple deaths and mucho destruction. Mark Bombacks script lacks authenticity but overflows with snappy dialogue the best of which is delivered by Long who is very funny as the wisecracking geek who becomes a functional ally of McClanes. If Willis comes back for another sequel hell have to bring Long with him. Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Starring Bruce Willis Timothy Olyphant Justin Long and Maggie Q. Directed by Len Wiseman. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SF Gate.com/movies.) Either ""Live Free or Die Hard"" will go down as the summers best action blockbuster or its going to be one exceptional summer. This time the hype is real. The latest ""Die Hard"" film the first in a dozen years is the best in the series an invigorating return to the style of blockbuster that dominated summers back in the early 1990s. In those days when the blockbuster was new there was an excitement about it as a popular new form. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" rediscovers the freshness of this much-abused genre by returning to basics strong characters compelling situations and grand (but human) scale action. Call this an overdue correction. Fifteen years ago computer graphics had finally evolved to the point that virtually everything imaginable could be depicted with the graphics augmenting live action. But over time the cart ran away with the horse. Recent blockbusters have appeared like oversize computer screens with a fake-looking Spider-Man swinging through a fake-looking New York skyline. The truth is nothing in ""Spider-Man 3"" or even the likable new ""Fantastic Four"" movie can compare in impact to the straightforward first action sequence in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" in which our hero John McClane (Bruce Willis) armed with just a handgun faces down five assassins wielding automatic weapons. Though 52 years old and as bald as a coot Willis looks even more formidable than he did when he made the first ""Die Hard"" movie 19 years ago. Willis has not gone soft on McClane and so McClane hasnt gone soft on us. He has a caustic unsentimental understanding of the character and presents us with a McClane whos a cynical difficult man one whom the years have only made smarter tougher and more calloused. His two saving graces are his humor and his usefulness. Its no surprise to hear that hes divorced because marriage is not what hes good for. McClane is good for crises and disasters which means hes great for this movie. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" plays off of two fears that pervade our present culture 1) terrorism; and 2) the possible existence of elite bands of computer geniuses who might seem like poorly nourished and poorly groomed young people but who in fact know all about stuff like ""mutating algorithmic security codes"" and are currently reading your e-mail. The conscienceless computer geek for whom sabotage is a prank and real life holds no meaning is a newly minted villain in recent films and here we get a whole team of them headed by Timothy Olyphant as Gabriel a cyber terrorist. Gabriel has a great plan. First he and his girlfriend Mai (Maggie Q) steal the best ideas from the smartest hackers out there. Then they kill the hackers -- by making their computers explode (an idea whose time has come). And then they set out to completely paralyze and destroy the United States. They have a room full of people who with a few strokes on a keyboard can get in anywhere and wreck everything. McClane (Willis) enters the equation when hes asked on behalf of the U.S. government to find an especially brilliant young hacker named Matt (Justin Long) and bring him to Washington. It seems like an annoying routine assignment until McClane finds out that the cyber terrorists are doing everything they can to kill this guy. Machine guns and helicopters are just the beginning. McClane has to protect the hacker and while hes at it figure out a way to save the country because the suits in Washington dont have a clue. All the real computer geniuses are apparently in the private sector. To enjoy ""Live Free or Die Hard"" requires one imaginative leap of faith -- that its possible for evil geeks to gain control of anything from the stoplights in Washington to the power grid that controls the entire Eastern corridor. Quibble with that and have a miserable time or accept that and in return get a film of nonstop interest and incident where the bad guys control everything and the good guys constantly have to scramble. Two hours and 10 minutes go by in a shot carried along by some great action sequences including a fight to the death in an elevator shaft. By playing it old school most of the way the movie earns the right to a spectacular sequence relying heavily on computer graphics in which an F-16 attacks a truck being driven by McClane -- and destroys an entire highway. Willis is in his element. Olyphant is perfectly ice cold. And Maggie Q makes a vivid impression as a sexy cyber terrorist/martial artist/homicidal maniac. Kevin Smith shows up in a nice featured role as a computer genius who lives in his mothers basement. ""Live Free or Die Hard"" saves its best and most emblematic moment for the finish. I wont say anything more except that it takes a classic climactic situation and resolves it in the coolest most unexpected and most low-tech way imaginable -- and in a way that reinforces everything youve ever liked about the ""Die Hard"" movies and McClane as a character. Its just terrific. -- Advisory Peril gun violence mild sadism and death.

"Never say die Willis proves in new sequel - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeNever say die Willis proves in new sequelIN REVIVED ROLE BRUCE WILLIS SAVES THE WORLD FROM HACKERSBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 06/26/2007 013417 AM PDTUpdated 06/26/2007 060912 AM PDTClick photo to enlarge John McClane (Bruce Willis) again finds himself in harms way in movie ""Live Free or Die Hard."" (Handout/MCT) <<1>> In the midst of a massive cyber-attack on the nations computer infrastructure - a network so vulnerable that its apparently possible to shut it down with a laptop and a really good WiFi connection - the criminal mastermind behind the plot in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" takes a tender moment with his stone-faced stiletto-heeled Eurasian kickboxing moll. Thomas Gabriel the evil genius who is about to ""hit the reset button"" on the United States is putting his girlfriend Mai (Maggie Q) on a chopper to personally shut down the Northeastern power grid. He gives her what at first appears to be a big kiss although its also possible hes performing some sort of data upload through her mouth. It was bound to come to this sooner or later With the idea that ""virtual terrorism"" will soon allow some IT guy with a snootful of Red Bull to Google Armageddon you knew that Hollywood would come up with an action hero to make the world safe from computer-savvy nerds. The shock isnt that they did it. The surprise is that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" - the fourth installment in a franchise begun in the 80s that seems determined to live up to its name - does it so remarkably well. Easily surpassing the two lamentable previous efforts in the series this fourth installment rivals the original ""Die Hard"" that made Bruce Willis a movie star. There is no form of overkill from which ""Live Free or Die Hard"" ever shrinks.Advertisement This point is asserted most strenuously during the scene in which Willis as NYPD Detective John McClane drives an SUV down an elevator shaft while attempting to make a hood ornament out of Gabriels girlfriend. Some will argue that the watershed moment when the movie goes insanely over the top occurs earlier when Willis purposely aims a speeding car at a traffic tunnels tollbooth using it to launch the vehicle skyward like a heat-seeking missile. He does this to bring down a hovering helicopter from which French-speaking hit men are firing machine guns at him. Mais oui But thats just a sedan. Maneuvering a gas guzzler down an elevator shaft - while a woman in eight-inch heels is attempting to open a can of kung fu whup-ass on you from the back seat - doesnt resemble anything weve ever seen before. Including life on the planet Earth. There are several stunts that are meant to make even jaded action movie audiences gasp including another in that same tunnel sequence in which a sedan somersaults toward McClane (and the camera) at astonishing speed before bouncing off some passing cars. Director Len Wiseman (""Underworld"") has made the stunts look less perfect and more real by using almost no computer-generated effects. This pays off. They are all impressively executed though youre more likely to laugh at the sheer improbability of them than gasp. Similarly McClane is an analog mote in the glassy digital eye of Gabriel (played by Timothy Olyphant better known as the good-guy sheriff on HBOs ""Deadwood""). We arent told exactly who Gabriel is or what he wants for a while though we see him giving orders to a retinue of pale pocket-protected hench-geeks. They send their first shot across the bow of the FBI Cyber-Security Division by hacking into its computer system. As one worried-looking agent tells the commander of this hapless unit ""They definitely cracked our door."" McClane is dispatched to fetch a young computer hacker named Matt (Justin Long) who explains that whats happening is known as a ""fire sale"" because everything must go. Matt is one of several cyber-geeks who has written an algorithm for the plot assuming that it was purely theoretical. As McClane rolls up to his apartment some rooftop assassins unleash a barrage of absolute hellfire on the two of them. But they miss and they go right on missing for the rest of the movie. Worst assassins ever. Theres a fair amount of dialogue like this ""Transportation hubs are prepped and set"" ""Begin Stage 1"" ""Upload the video package"" ""Begin Stage 2"" And theres one enormous plot glitch during which we learn that two government spooks have been keeping a little secret that changes everything. That this wrinkle could have been avoided by simply giving the cops credit for being as smart as the hackers only makes the flaw seem more egregious.

And whos going to save the day? John McClane that two-fisted old school New York City cop from a trio of vintage Die Hards thats who. The guy probably doesnt even own a PC. In Live Free or Die Hard the fourth installment in Bruce Willis blow-em-up blockbuster franchise - and the first in 12 long years - gigabytes and fisticuffs collide. The result pretty much what youd expect. The action kicks off when McClane is dispatched in the dead of night to pick up a Camden hacker wanted by the Feds. Its Independence Day weekend and the FBI short on staff calls in a favor. John McClane (not to be confused with a certain two-fisted old school presidential candidate) has been stalking his college-age daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) making sure shes behaving herself - and that her date is behaving himself - when the assignment comes in. So its off to Camden where ace hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) lives and where a band of French thugs are about to blow him to smithereens. Luckily McClane gets there first - just before the subtitles read ""kill him"" Let the ammo and the automobiles - and the jokes about how ancient and out of touch McClane is - fly. Live Free or Die Hard directed in workmanlike style by Underworld Evolutions Len Wiseman has its share of wild stunts and spectacular carnage but it feels pokey and predictable too. Willis with his shaved noggin and smug mug commandeers cars and copters improvising various life-saving and death-causing escapes (fire hydrants as projectiles elevator shafts as places to park a car). He unleashes massive amounts of automatic weapons fire and even engages in some kickboxing with Maggie Q. (The Hong Kong star does the martial arts stuff - McClane just waits until he can plant a solid uppercut.) Timothy Olyphant playing a disgruntled ex-Defense Department cyber-security expert is the ringleader of the team of computer nerds and Frenchy henchmen bent on bringing Americas electronic infrastructure down thereby causing mass chaos and facilitating the theft of millions of 401(k) plans. Come July 5 the country will not only be broken - itll be broke. Long who looks - and acts - like Keanu Reeves kid brother tags along with Willis. The two trade insults (""Youre like a Timex watch in a digital age"" the Kid tells McClane) and sneer contemptuously at the bureaucratic ineptitude of the FBI (headed by Cliff ""Get me a secure line"" Curtis). Too long too loud and lacking in good lines (the Timex crack is typical) Live Free or Die Hard does its job. Its the movie equivalent of a cop on the eve of retirement he knows what he has to do and he gets it done. But his heart isnt really in it anymore.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com. Read his blog ""On Movies Online"" at http//go.philly.com/onmovies.

"Summer Boom Time washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Summer Boom Time Simply smashing An airborne patrol car demolishes a helicopter in the fourth chapter of the series starring Bruce Willis this time as a geezer up against some evil geeks. (Twentieth Century Fox) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Tuesday June 26 2007 Summertime may have officially arrived five days ago but everyone knows its not bona fide until an action movie that kicks major tushie hits the screens. And ""Live Free or Die Hard"" -- the latest installment of what by rights should be the creakiest adventure franchise in Hollywood -- does the honors with gritty more-is-more abandon. At a time when the action genre has come to be dominated by sleek matte surfaces and set-em-and-forget-em computerized effects ""Live Free or Die Hard"" seeks to remind viewers of the simple nostalgic pleasures of watching stuff get blown up and bad guys get smoked. And oh how they blow up and get smoked albeit in the course of yet another numbing two-hour-plus running time. As ""Live Free or Die Hard"" opens it looks like its going to be one of those ""Matrix""-y odes to technology and Zen battle with an unpromising montage of jittery computer screen close-ups and attractive young people wearing headsets and typing. But soon enough a ranch house belonging to one of those computer geeks goes up in the first of several fireballs and were off to the races. It turns out that all that typing is being masterminded by an angry webmaster and his hacker minions who are busy executing a systemwide monkey wrench that will bring the entire country to its techno-dependent knees. The FBI on the trail of hacker minion Matt Farrell (Justin Long) asks New York cop John McClane (Bruce Willis) to track the kid down in New Jersey (no not Hackensack) and bring him to Washington for questioning. Thus does Our Man McClane who began offing terrorists 19 years ago in the very first ""Die Hard"" (this is the fourth) find himself doing battle with the new cyber-version of the baddies as he and Matt wend their way down I-95 while the entire countrys transportation communication and utility systems go blooey. Preoccupied with a disintegrating relationship with his daughter and a chronic case of existential alienation McClane is the muscle of the team while Matt --who the villain is desperately trying to eliminate before he can talk to the bureau -- is luckily played by the guy from those Apple computer ads on television. (The villain named Thomas Gabriel and regrettably underplayed by Timothy Olyphant resembles Richard Clarke if hed watched ""Speed"" one too many times. Far more memorable is Gabriels assistant Mai played by the gorgeous Maggie Q whose character is the target of McClanes most offensive verbal epithets.) Director Len Wiseman who most recently perpetrated the dreadful ""Underworld"" movies on an unsuspecting public does a pretty good job at whats most important in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" deliver the whammies on a regular and with a little luck surprising basis. With the bad guys here representing technology at its most insidiously powerful the filmmakers set themselves up as the champions of all that is analog old school and authentic; thus the stunts in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" have the snarling crunch of a junkyard dog. When McClane first encounters Matts pursuers he bluntly dispatches them with a decidedly low-tech fire extinguisher; a few moments later he drags one of them through an alley on the side of his car finally smashing him up against a dumpster. Indeed in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" most people are taken out by way of vehicular homicide manslaughter or recklessness. The best scenes in the movie involve the three-way smashup featured in the ads an SUV dangling in an elevator shaft and a hilarious sequence involving a helicopter. (According to the paper-rock-scissors calculation fire hydrant beats copter and car trumps both.) With the exception of some really nifty black rubber computer keyboards and a terrorist-threat sequence reminiscent of the culture-jamming cult band Emergency Broadcast Network ""Live Free or Die Hard"" at times seems to have been constructed entirely of concrete rebar and chain link. The fact that some of the effects in the film were generated by the very computers that the filmmakers hold in such disdain is beside the point in a movie that deploys technology in the service of the 1980s action aesthetic the first ""Die Hard"" defined. With his head shaved and comfortably showing his age Willis seems to nod toward the McClane of 1988 while admitting that with years come limitations. He still takes bullets and beatings with improbable aplomb showing a degree of physical stamina that the neurotic stammering Matt both admires and finds ludicrous. ""Theres tough and theres stupid"" Matt suggests at one point having not received the memo that the ""Die Hard"" movies mean to be both in a good way. Willis and Long have an easy witty rapport or at least they seem to The dialogue is so slurry and rapid-fire that most of it sails past like so many overturned tractor-trailers. The point of their relationship of course is that while Matt represents the future its McClane with his unerring sense of old-fashioned values who will triumph. (Actual quote ""Its not a system its a country"") As easy as it is to misread ""Live Free or Die"" as a conservative wish-fulfilled fantasy McClane is as disgusted by dithering feds and the modern surveillance culture as he is by weedy lily-livered knowledge workers. For him theyre all just part of one big O.K. Corral. Like so many genre exercises featuring the lone hero with a gun ""Live Free or Die Hard"" doesnt subscribe to any particular ideology other than what can best be described as libertarian testosterism. Its not for nothing that ""Live Free or Die Hard"" is set during a Fourth of July holiday weekend; with its early fireworks and yippee-ki-yay set pieces it dutifully engages in the cinematic excesses that have come to be seen as American as apple pie if the pie were suddenly set on fire and smashed into billions of gooey pieces. If audiences arent rolling their eyes at the movies over-the-top final sequence in which McClane drives a semi-trailer on the Baltimore Beltway while being shot at from a fighter jet (hey just another day on 695) theyll be laughing both with and at it. And theyll be grateful for the movies ambitious if essentially contradictory mission to keep it real even as it engages in unreality at its most preposterous. Is ""Live Free or Die Hard"" utterly ridiculous completely absurd totally insane? Of course it is. Forget it Jake. Its summertime. Live Free or Die Hard (130 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense violence and action profanity and brief sexual content.

Its the Luddite versus the techies in ""Live Free or Die Hard"" and guess who wins. Back for a fourth round after a decade on the sequel sidelines Bruce Willis enthusiastically resurrects resourceful working-class cop John McClane as the unlikely opponent of computer creeps bent on bringing down a digital-dependent nation. Tone careens madly from serious peril to action camp and everything in between but the sheer quantity of often outrageous stunts should help overcome franchise mustiness to entertain general auds and rack up solid returns here and abroad. First two ""Die Hard"" installments appeared in 1988 and 1990 -- the third followed in 1995 -- meaning that those interested in reviving the series had to confront the fact that much of the target aud for such a picture wasnt even born when John McTiernans original hit the screen. Fox scenarist Mark Bomback and co-story writer David Marconi have responded in obvious and safe ways pairing Willis with a scruffy young computer geek with an anti-authoritarian streak and an aversion to physicality (Justin Long) making the villains disaffected (and very attractive) Yanks rather than foreign religious fanatics and tailoring the package for a PG-13 rating rather than an R which is what the previous three entries received. Helmer Len Wiseman a musicvid vet with a certain following based on the ""Underworld"" duo plays up the incongruity of McClane being forced to confront the technical expertise of very 21st-century baddies who know how to shut down communications data and security systems with the tap of a laptop key. When the FBI realizes its computers have been hacked into McClane is assigned to haul in Matt Farrell (Long) a New Jersey slacker on a laundry list of suspects. Even this isnt easy however as French () assassins frantically attempt to take Matt out even as McClane endeavors to spirit him away. In short order the ultra-efficient culprits led by ice-cold black-clad tech genius Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) bring Washington D.C. to the sort of standstill it hasnt experienced since ""The Day the Earth Stood Still."" After Wall Street is thrown into similar disarray Matt sees that someone is setting off a ""fire sale"" a three-step plan to shut down everything in the country thats run by computer. While the government -- Homeland Security FBI NSA the armed forces police et al. -- scrambles to figure out what to do McClane tries to keep Matt alive at least long enough to reveal what he knows about the dastardly project in which he was an unwitting participant. At every turn they are attacked by Gabriels well-armed goons precipitating numerous action scenes that are ludicrous on the face of things -- McClane successfully battles a marauding helicopter with a fire hydrant then a vaulting car and later rides the wing of a spinning fighter jet -- but so much so that theyll become the sort of audience talking points people will have to see for themselves. Along the way the anti-gov nasties also kidnap McClanes daughter (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) making the battle ""personal"" in time-honored tradition. All the ""Die Hard"" films have centered upon terrorists but the ones until now dwelled in the pre-9/11 world; by avoiding contempo reality (theres barely a mention of it) new entry can legitimately be accused of evasiveness even timidity. But filmmakers largely disarm this sort of criticism by recasting the film as a virtual action cartoon one you can laugh at and even enjoy for the preposterousness of its propositions. Any doubts about how seriously pic is intended are dispelled in the third act with the arrival of Kevin ""Clerks"" Smith as the ultimate high-tech geek who humorously handles an overload of exposition and helps close the noose around Gabriel and his misguided cohorts. Head shaven and still in fine shape Willis has no trouble convincing that hes still capable of handling heavy action. Longs character spends so much time seeming desperate that thesp has little opportunity to give him other personality traits leaving Matt a basically rote creation. Olyphant is all unruffled smoothness as the vengeful villain while Maggie Q as Gabriels martial arts-proficient g.f. and Winstead as McClanes initially estranged daughter provide incidental hottie moments. Set pieces outlandishness notwithstanding pics physical aspects feel convincingly real.
