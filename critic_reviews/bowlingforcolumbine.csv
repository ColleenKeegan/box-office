People laughed cheered jeered at the ""villains"" and burst into prolonged applause when it ended. Anyone clinging to the old canard that documentaries are dry dusty affairs obviously hasnt seen one of Moores. Like the movie that put him on the map ""Roger amp; Me"" (one of the most successful documentaries ever released) his latest screed is an impure and highly entertaining gumbo of comedy confrontation righteous anger crusading zeal dubious populism and moral showboating.Its impossible not to have strong reactions to ""Columbine."" People tend to reject it outright or defend it wholesale and both positions seem equally wrong. Its both powerful and infuriating brilliant and facile hilarious and horrific witty and demagogic. Its a great movie to argue about. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Baseball cap in place Moore sets off on a quest to understand the unique American romance between guns and violence. Why do Americans blow each other away at a rate that far exceeds any other country? The filmmaker admits upfront that he was a gun-loving NRA member himself at an early age--the first indication that not all our knee-jerk leftist assumptions are going to be met. His journey takes him from his home state of Michigan to Colorado to L.A. and to Canada from a startling visit to a Michigan bank where the prize for opening a new account is a handgun to an unnerving appointment with Oklahoma bombing suspect Terry Nicholss brother. The guy sleeps with a loaded .44 under his pillow and looks like he might use it at any moment.Moores methods are scattershot impressionistic and personal rigorous historical analysis is not his bag. He often settles for easy ironies and broad gestures such as playing Louis Armstrongs ""Its A Wonderful World"" over a montage of U.S. aggression in Iran and Guatemala and Nicaragua. He visits the missile-manufacturing Lockheed Martin plant near Columbine implying a dubious connection between the weapons plants (and our aggressive foreign policy) and the high-school shooting spree. So if Lockheed Martin were based in Vermont Columbine wouldnt have happened?Even more annoying--especially for someone who fancies himself a man of the people--is the way Moore sometimes makes himself look good at the expense of his unsuspecting subjects. Theres an irrelevant interlude in South-Central L.A. where Moore thrusts a mike in front of a busy L.A. cop and asks him a whimsical antipollution question about why its impossible to see the Hollywood sign through the smog. The audience is prompted to laugh at the cops flustered response but this cheap ""Candid Camera"" ploy exposes the condescension lurking beneath Moores camaraderie.I was afraid we were in for more of the same when Moore shows up at Kmart corporate headquarters with a wheelchair-bound victim of the Columbine shooting. They are on a mission to protest the selling of bullets at Kmart (its where the killers of the 1999 shooting spree bought their ammo). Anyone whos seen Moores other movies knows what to expect--a corporate runaround in which all the Kmart bureaucrats will come off looking evasive and hypocritical. But an amazing thing happens--the mission succeeds. Kmart agrees to stop selling bullets. You can see that Moore is as surprised as we are. Still you have to take your hat off to the guy what other filmmaker could actually change a major corporate policy--and with the cameras rolling?""Bowling for Columbines"" saving grace--what keeps it intellectually honest--is the fact that Moore doesnt have all the answers to his questions. He holds up one cliched theory after another about the root causes of American violence and punctures holes in most of them. The movie isnt saying that guns in themselves are the problem even if it demonizes Charlton Heston and the NRA for their extraordinary insensitivity. (The group held their annual meeting in nearby Denver just after the tragedy.) Canada he points out is as gun-obsessed as the U.S. Canadians own 7 million guns. They are subjected to the same barrage of violence in movies and music. They too suffer from poverty and unemployment and have a multiethnic population. Yet in the same year that 11127 people were murdered by guns in the U.S. only 165 were killed in Canada. Theres a very funny sequence in which Moore goes from house to house in Toronto and discovers that nobody bothers to lock their doors there. (Needless to say the Toronto audience ate up the flattery.)Those unlocked Canadian doors get at the heart of Moores argument for what he sees in America is a culture ruled by fear a fear fueled by the news media and the politicians and exploited for profit and power a fear disproportionate to any real danger. (Remember the Y2K panic anyone? How much money was made off that one? Take a look at those SUV ads that feature hissing rattlesnakes to see how Madison Avenue plays the fear-for-profit game.) Moores thesis comes via Barry Glassner a University of Southern California professor and the author of ""The Culture of Fear."" Its a provocative argument though one formulated before the events of 9-11. Not that our very real anxieties about terrorism negate the Glassner-Moore thesis. On the contrary one has only to look at how the Bush administration is exploiting that fear--and hyping new scares--to see the connection between fear and political power. (What happened to the notion that in times of trial our leaders were supposed to reassure us?)The person who articulates the connection between panic and consumerism most eloquently is of all people Marilyn Manson the cultural conservatives favorite bogeyman. When Moore asks him what hed tell the kids at Columbine hes the only one with the wisdom to say he wouldnt tell them anything hed listen to what they had to say. How can you not like a movie in which Marilyn Manson is positioned as the voice of reason?Thats Moore at his unexpected best. For him at his self-righteous worst theres the aftermath of his interview with Charlton Heston at the movie stars home. Heston feeling (correctly) ambushed cuts off the interview and walks off in a huff. Moore then plants a photo of the murdered Flint 6-year-old outside Hestons door and walks away with his head hanging solemnly the camera lovingly recording his sensitivity. It was almost enough to make me sympathetic to Heston--if the NRA president hadnt hung himself with an unconsciously racist remark.Yes Moore when hes not being funny and smart can at times be a self-aggrandizing pain in the ass but too many critics have dismissed his movie on the basis of their personal animosity. But who else in our timidly apolitical movie culture is raising these issues planting these grenades under the body politic? Who else has the chutzpah to show up camera in hand on Kmarts doorsteps? Perhaps it takes a shameless showman to get American moviegoers to ponder these essential questions about our national nature. His razzle-dazzle techniques can be superficial but his movie is deep enough to draw blood. Dont swallow ""Bowling for Columbine"" whole. Fight it. Question it. Enjoy it. But by all means dont miss it.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Bush Dick Clark Charlton Heston John Nichols Marilyn Manson Matt Stone; Director Michael Moore; Author Michael Moore; Release Date Limited 10/11/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 125; MPAA Rating R; Distributor United Artists (MGM) Posted October 23 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT The first time I watched Bowling for Columbine was this past May at the Cannes Film Festival where European camera crews crowded outside the screening room eager for confirmation from exiting American journalists that the United States really is the culturally barren territory of gun-crazy idiots and weasels that filmmaker Michael Moore makes it out to be. And I was dismayed by the gleeful excitement of my international colleagues their stupidest opinions of America confirmed by a large unkempt rambunctious shlub of a native who wears his gimme cap the way other stars favor sunglasses. The second time I watched ""Bowling for Columbine"" was last week in my New York neighborhood in a full theater on a Friday night when a sniper in the Washington D.C. area was still terrifying citizens. The weary urban audience around me didnt need to be told that there are gun-crazy idiots and weasels in the land but they enjoyed the opportunity to laugh (rather than weep) at the proof anyhow. And I was dismayed because I realized Michael Moore - the guy who made ""Roger amp; Me"" and the best-selling author of ""Stupid White Men"" - is one of the only large unkempt rambunctious shlubs around doing this provocative stuff on a popular mass-movie level. We need his noisy cocky energy his passion and class consciousness; we need his shticks we need his stones. We also need more filmmakers on the left to challenge Moore and to do the kind of stuff he does only better. Because as a political provocateur hes a one-man gang that cant shoot straight. Among Moores points in ""Bowling for Columbine"" is that guns are neutral things in themselves but lethal in the hands of a certain kind of inflamed American - and awfully easy for Americans to acquire. (Moore opens a bank account just to get the rifle that comes as a gift to new customers.) He argues that in a right-to-bear-arms/gotta-defend-the-homeland culture like ours lenient gun-control laws and easily obtainable weapons are a dangerous combination. And for tragic proof he replays the terrible story of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold who killed and died at Columbine High School in Littleton Colo. (About the title Bowling was the boys first class on the morning of their shooting spree.) An unspooling of the security-camera coverage of the two on their rampage accompanied by audiotape of eyewitness accounts is horrifying; Moore also enlists a couple of students who survived the carnage - one is in a wheelchair paralyzed - to assist him in a ""Roger amp; Me""-like assault on Kmart the company from which the Columbine bullets were bought. But as in all his movie and TV work Moore cant resist detours that provide momentary fun - and lingering confusion about his intentions. ""Bowling for Columbine"" includes footage of Chris Rocks sharp comedy riff about expensive bullets as a crime deterrent; an impossibly compacted maddeningly superficial history of American foreign-policy hypocrisies; a powerful indictment of Michigans ""welfare to work"" policies (complicit Moore concludes in the shooting death of one 6-year-old child by another in his hometown of Flint); and a ""South Park""-ish nod to Canadians who apparently keep a lot of guns too but dont use them on one another. (They also dont lock their front doors; Moore opens a few and draws a national conclusion.) The relentless bombardment of info-bits is the movies appeal and maybe Moore - who grew up around firearms and who became a lifetime member of the NRA after Columbine to agitate for change from within - is right Maybe scatter-shooting is the most effective trick for keeping general audiences entertained enough to entertain serious questions about controversial issues. But Moore has never overcome his polemical weakness for getting more fun out of making detours than out of making points. And his signature move - of waylaying people in positions of power or at least documenting his righteous failure to do so - only grows less pleasing with repeated use. Certainly the receptionists security guards and lower-level staffers caught in the camera dont deserve the discomfort. And even the big fish who swim into Moores net merit better sport. He barely dings Dick Clark about the low-wage welfare-to-work employees who staff one of Clarks mall-food establishments in Michigan but Moore gets momentarily close to actor and NRA president Charlton Heston who makes the mistake (hubris? vanity? frailty?) of allowing the filmmaker into his Los Angeles home. The documentarian may have a valid complaint - that Heston and the NRA showed outrageous insensitivity in showing up for rallies in Littleton and Flint soon after child-on-child gun violence. What Moore wants to get from the encounter (and what he wanted the audience to enjoy) however is troublesome. As the actor (foolish old man? canny representative of a powerful lobbying group?) courteously but abruptly concludes the interview and makes his rickety way down the corridor to privacy even Moores target ticket-buyers are likely to squirm with concern unsure of who the real weasels and idiots are in this large unkempt rambunctious country of ours.

Directed by Michael Moore. (VHS and DVD. R. 119 minutes.) ""Bowling for Columbine"" takes a critical look at gun ownership in the United States but it expands the debate so much -- and so well thanks to Michael Moores daring interviews indelible humor and unflinching eye for detail -- that the documentary reaches an exalted level of filmmaking. It explains the very fabric of American society. ""Bowling for Columbine"" reminds us that this is a society where more than 11000 people die every year from guns where TV news and entertainment programs gorge on a diet of violent images where banks give away rifles to customers where the public lives in fear of being robbed and killed and where government leaders tell people that its OK to solve problems with might and militarism. Moore centers his thesis on the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton Colo. where two students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 classmates. People blamed their depravity on everything from violent video games to the music of shock-rocker Marilyn Manson (whos interviewed in ""Bowling""). But Moore says the problem of violence in America is much much deeper than that and points his finger at a cross section of factors including racism. Its no coincidence Moore believes that the NRA and the Ku Klux Klan were founded around the same time 130 years ago. Decades from now historians will look back at ""Bowling for Columbine"" and say it captured the zeitgeist. The questions that Moore asks are designed to spark debate. The answers are packaged in a way that will produce laughter tears and anger. Advisory This film contains scenes of violence.

Rated R for some violent images and language. Egyptian What gets you while watching Michael Moores gun documentary ""Bowling for Columbine"" are the tears. A grade-school principal turns away from the camera and weeps remembering the loss of a 6-year-old student fatally shot by a classmate. A security consultant in Littleton Colo. home of Columbine High School gets choked up on mention of the 1999 massacre. Most painful of all accompanying grainy Columbine videotapes that look like scenes from a horrific video game is a voice on a 911 call. ""Theyre firing shots in the library"" says the voice somewhere between a sob and a shout. Moore (""Roger amp; Me"") has made a flawed film but an important one; a documentary that occasionally borders on incoherence but as often speaks with utter clarity. Why he asks are there so many gun deaths in the United States? Is there something in our culture that makes us more violent than say Canadians who have just as many guns but far fewer shooting deaths? Moores answer is a complex one but boils down to something simple. We are he says a people consumed by fear. Its a powerful message and Moore pounds it home with a heartfelt urgency. Never one to keep his own opinion and personality quietly off-camera he trudges through the film like Everyman with a camera crew narrating in his folksy slightly nasal voice as he travels from Colorado to Michigan to Ontario to California. Hes got an unfortunate fondness for making regular people look foolish (remember the woman who sold rabbits in ""Roger amp; Me""?) and its a bit cringe-worthy here when he coyly asks an earnest law-enforcement official whether a dog can be arrested for a crime or lets a few Columbine classmates ramble on incoherently. Elsewhere though hes uncannily on target. Early in the film he enters a suburban bank branch thats advertising a free gun giveaway with new accounts. (""We are a licensed firearm dealer"" says the teller with no apparent irony.) Moore agreeably fills out a form makes a deposit gets his gun and wonders aloud whether guns and banks arent an odd combination. And even he seems genuinely affected when another stunt -- bringing several wounded Columbine students to Kmart headquarters to ""return"" the Kmart-purchased bullets still in their bodies -- has a surprising and very positive result. Moore gives short shrift to viewpoints other than his own here though he does ambush a few opposing voices. NRA president Charlton Heston interviewed at home mumbles something alarming about the ""mixed ethnicities"" in the U.S. contributing to gun violence. (The film was made prior to Hestons announcement that he has Alzheimers but Heston seems dazed and the interview has a cruel edge.) And his approach to the topic can only be described as scattershot -- Moore careens from discussions of foreign policy to interviews with militia members to wandering onto peoples front porches to see if their doors are locked with links that are tenuous at best. Surely the case of Susan Smith who drowned her children in her car is borderline relevant here as is an interview with Dick Clark who owned the chain of restaurants that employed the mother of the boy who shot the 6-year-old. (Wisely Clark avoids the camera.) But despite its messiness ""Columbine"" is devastating viewing. Watch it argue about it embrace it denounce it -- Moores put his finger on something we all need to talk about before only tears remain. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

"Bowling for Columbine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bowling-for-columbine ) Bowling for Columbine (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli While there will always be a debate about the authenticity of Michael Moores documentary techniques theres no arguing that Bowling for Columbine succeeds equally well as a provocative essay on gun violence in America and an opportunity for the writer/director to engage in some heavy self-promotion. Whether you like him or hate him its impossible to deny Moores charisma and persuasiveness as a showman. He takes a thesis and runs with it and while some of his conclusions may be a little farfetched his probing often pays unexpected dividends. Bowling for Columbine is Moores most effective film to-date - a vastly more compelling piece of pseudo-documentary movie-making than either the overrated Roger and Me or the ego-inflating The Big One. Viewers attending a Moore film should be aware that the director has a history of ""faking"" scenes. So unlike in a more traditional documentary not everything that appears on screen can be believed. Moore is skillful enough that we dont recognize when were being fooled. It took a Film Comment expose by Harlan Jacobson to unearth all of the behind-the-scenes shenanigans in Roger and Me. So when Moore ambushes Charlton Heston during an interview theres no guarantee that this wasnt set up beforehand (although I dont think it was). Also when Moore starts barging into houses in Toronto to determine whether Canadians keep their doors locked this could easily have been arranged before the cameras rolled. We just dont know. Moore claims one thing; his history argues another. Regardless of how dubious its documentary tactics may be Bowling for Columbine is powerful thought-provoking and upon occasion bitingly funny. Moores easygoing tone never makes the viewer feel threatened - just as his rumpled personal appearance puts his victims and adversaries at ease. Hes a predator in disguise. The movie offers something for everyone. Even those who disagree with Moores politics will find themselves thinking during and after the movie. Whether you agree with the directors conclusions isnt the issue - its that you recognize the problem. The point of the film is to determine why gun violence especially that of children on children is rampant in this country. At first Moore is guided by the precept that easy access to guns is the cause. And despite being a card-carrying NRA member he is more than willing to point the finger at Heston and his cronies. But along the way Moore makes a discovery - there are more guns per household in Canada than in the United States yet the death toll even when adjusted to consider the unequal populations is much lower. This forces Moore to conclude that while the ready availability of firearms in the United States may be a contributing factor to the high number of gun-related homicides its not the primary reason. Eventually after conducting various interviews and hopping around the country (and out of it) Moore suggests that fear enhanced by the medias obsession with death and violent crime may be the root cause of Americas death-by-gun problem. Americans are frightened. They live in gated communities and lock their doors at night. They sleep with loaded guns under their pillows because only a firearm at-ready gives them a sense of security. Fear makes people jumpy and apprehensive and more apt to resort to violence. And theres no cure for it. It is a societal ill that is perpetuated by the evening news and reality TV shows like ""Cops"". Once in a while Moore goes down a rat hole. He tries with limited success to blame the death of a six year-old girl on a work-for-welfare program. If you follow his convoluted logic it makes a certain kind of sense but hes stretching things. A more likely culprit is the uncle who didnt keep his gun safely locked away from the youngster who brought it to school and fired it. Strangely Moore never addresses the issue of gun responsibility and safety. The film features a number of fascinating interviews. The one with Heston is the most predictable since theres probably nothing that he and Moore agree upon. The most unusual is probably the chat between the director and James Nichols (the brother of Oklahoma City co-conspirator Terry Nichols) who makes a comment along the lines of ""The pen is mightier than the sword but you have to have a sword for when the pen fails."" Nichols also makes a statement about weapons-grade Plutonium that has to be heard to be believed. Other interview subjects include Columbine alumnist (and co-creator of ""South Park"") Matt Stone and goth rocker Marilyn Manson (who was blamed in some circles for the Columbine tragedy). Moore engages in his share of grandstanding stunts one of which surprisingly pays off. He brings two Columbine survivors to the Michigan headquarters of K-Mart (the ammunition used to shoot them was purchased at a K-Mart store) and asks if the boys can return the bullets that are still in their bodies. The next day K-Mart announces that after a 90-day phase out period it will no longer be selling ammunition. Moore is flabbergasted. I can predict with a large degree of certainty that Bowling for Columbine will outrage viewers whose political leanings are conservative. In addition to portraying many gun owners in an unflattering light Moore insinuates that the CIA was indirectly responsible for the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center (a view that is bound to be unpopular regardless of how it is presented). The film is at times laugh-aloud viciously funny (provided you arent among Moores targets). But above all no matter how much you love or despise the messenger and his means theres no denying that the message bears consideration and rumination. Imperfect as it may be Bowling for Columbine is riveting stuff.
