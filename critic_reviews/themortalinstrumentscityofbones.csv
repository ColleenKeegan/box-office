Grade C+ The first movie adaptation of Cassandra Clares ""Mortal Instrument"" series ""City of Bones"" starts like a house afire or at least a Brooklyn apartment then splutters into heaps of creative ashes. (Next up - no kidding - is ""City of Ashes."") Like many a young adult fantasy these days this movie carries tons of exposition and pseudo-mythology on its back. Its the spawn of a literary menage a trois - think of J.K. Rowling Stephenie Meyer and J.R.R. Tolkien as the parents with George Lucas as godfather. The teenage heroine Clary Fare (Lily Collins) goes to a Goth club in New York where she witnesses a murder that no one else can see pulled off by three chic tattooed killers equipped with baroque weaponry. The next day one of them Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) who looks like a refugee from the ""Twilight"" movies (which of course Bower is) tracks her down and tells her that hes actually a heroic demon-killer. Mid-explanation Clary receives a frantic phone call from her devoted single mother (Lena Headey). Clary races back to their apartment where she uses the flame of a gas oven to fight a demon. Jace shows up in the nick of time. He teaches Clary that the world is divided between ""mundanes"" - normal people - and Shadowhunters. Part angel and part human they can make themselves invisible to mundanes. They were born roughly a millennium ago when the angel Azriel (traditionally the angel of death) poured his blood into a chalice and mixed it with that of a noble knight. Those who drink from this ""Mortal Cup"" as well as their descendants are empowered to unmask and destroy demons. Clarys mom had been hiding the Mortal Cup from a rogue Shadowhunter (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) when his evil forces swept down and kidnapped her. Clarys mother was once a powerful Shadowhunter - and Clary herself may be the most potent of them all. Clary enters the Shadowhunters world and drags her best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) along with her. They join forces with Jace and his pals to rescue her mother and to protect the Mortal Cup. As Clary learns how to navigate a Byzantine netherworld which includes witches warlocks and part-demon part-human ""Downworlders"" (like vampires and werewolves) the movie displays some feisty funny attitude. The filmmakers win affectionate laughs when Simon yells ""The werewolves are here to save us. Never thought Id say that."" At the films high point Jace relates the secret life of Johann Sebastian Bach demon killer. It turns out that his mathematical progressions of chords can still rouse monsters out of hiding. Sadly director Harold Zwart fails to maintain this playful tone. Early on Clary asks Jace humorously enough ""Is this the part where you start tearing off pieces of your shirt to bind my wounds?"" Not much later the film stumbles on the usual pitfalls of inflated banal teen triangles. Alas at one point Simon even tells Clary that Jace is just ""using"" her. As the plot thickens so does the movie to the point of indigestibility. (Jessica Postigo wrote the script.) Dramatically the film dumps one complication after another in your lap from weak links in the Shadowhunter hierarchy to laughably abrupt revelations about secret parentage and possible incest. (Lucas needed hours to make similar moments pay off in the ""Star Wars"" series.) Even when the film is visually striking - particularly in a secret city underneath a cemetery governed by Grim Reaper-like brothers with mouths stitched shut - the images dont stick with you or haunt you. (See one serpentine or ashen demon and youve seen them all.) Thats partly because Zwart is no great camera stylist. But its mostly because he rushes to unspool the story line of a book thats 485 pages long. The film lacks rhythm momentum and near the end a cathartic surge. Cutting between a pair of routine battles doesnt make either of them memorable. Before the producers start shooting the second movie in the series they should secure a mortal instrument of their own an anticlimax control.

""Harry Potter"" ""Twilight"" ""The Hunger Games"" and others have dramatized this critical period to great success both in print and onscreen. For studios seeking another such franchise gold mine Cassandra Clares ""Mortal Instruments"" a hefty best-selling sextet of YA novels would seem the next big thing. Not only does it exploit the same demographic as those other properties it shares swaths of their DNA.

TWITTER Lily Collins stars in Sonys adaptation of Cassandra Clares best-selling YA book. Certainly not the first and very unlikely the last studio attempt at launching a Twilight/Hunger Games franchise of their very own The Mortal Instruments City of Bones is a bona fide saga all right -- just not in a good way. Based on the first in a best-selling series of fantasy adventure novels by Cassandra Clare this Canada-Germany co-production is an overlong melodramatic take on the age-old battle between the forces of good and evil. PHOTOS Teenage Dreams 17 of the Most Popular YA Properties Adapted for TV and Film All the usual suspects are here from the conflicted heroine and her rival suitors from decidedly different walks of life to the dark sinister forces that threaten to tear them apart both figuratively and literally. But despite the overstuffed assortment of vampires werewolves warlocks and demons of all shapes and sizes The Mortal Instruments seldom feels like anything more than a shameless soulless knockoff. Released well ahead of the traditionally challenging Labor Day holiday weekend the Screen Gems presentation could still snare some young female mallgoers on the hunt for a little break from back-to-school shopping. A sequel is already slated to begin shooting in Toronto this fall. Despite that ring of familiarity the film starts off energetically as Clarissa ""Clary"" Fray (Lily Collins) begins to realize that she isnt the average everyday Brooklyn teen she thought she was seeing symbols and people that nobody else does. VIDEO Mortal Instruments How Author Cassandra Clare Helped Bring the Book to Life When her mom (Lena Headey) goes missing upon being attacked by a particularly nasty demon Clary and her platonic geeky buddy Simon (Robert Sheehan) team up with chronically brooding Shadowhunter Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower) to help track her down. Meanwhile the aforementioned dark forces are closing in on her convinced that she knows the location of The Mortal Cup a vessel that could create serious havoc if it fell into the wrong hands. While director Harald Zwart (the Jaden Smith Karate Kid remake) briskly sets the scene the proceedings soon get bogged down by all the ponderous exposition and stone-faced dialogue credited to screenwriter Jessica Postigo Paquette that grows sillier by the second. Among the films more smirk-inducing revelations Bach was not only a great composer but a Shadowhunter himself (with the identifying tattoos to prove it) who deliberately wrote note combinations that would drive demons nuts. In the face of that sort of nonsense Collins does her best to remain rooted in her character conveying a persuasive empathy against increasing odds. The other characters including Jonathan Rhys Meyers as the power-hungry Shadowhunter Valentine and Jared Harris as Jaces tutor Hodge Starkweather have it tougher infusing some much-needed dimension although CCH Pounder manages to make the most of her eye-rolling turn as tarot card-reading Madame Dorothea. Production values are generally lively thanks to some imaginative visual effects and production design especially during a sequence set in the vampire-filled ballroom of the derelict Hotel Dumort.

Starring Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Kevin Zegers and Lena Headey. Directed by Harald Zwart. (PG-13. 130 minutes.) Every moviegoer will have his own breaking point when ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" surpasses the mundane and enters the ridiculous. For some it will be upon first hearing that ponderous title. Others will give in when Lane Pryce from ""Mad Men"" shows up as an agoraphobic librarian in a secret castle humans cant see. For me it was upon learning - small spoiler here - that composer Johann Sebastian Bach was actually a demon hunter who created songs using crafty musical settings that work like a dog whistle for hell spawn. B minor seems to make their eyes turn white and bug out the most. ""The Mortal Instruments"" (were dropping the last three words from now on - newsprint costs money) is a film that fans of Cassandra Clares book series will enjoy or at least absorb with interest as they see their favorite characters on the big screen. Almost everyone else will watch a bad movie with too much exposition ridiculous dialogue an unsympathetic heroine and a love triangle that goes nowhere like a season of ""Threes Company."" All of which is even more deadly because of the 130-minute running time. Gather with your favorite shadowhunters and downworlders and pray on the Mortal Cup that you never have to watch a directors cut. Shadowhunters? Mortal Cup? This is the world of ""Mortal Instruments"" where young Clary Fray (Lily Collins) discovers she is related to the shadowhunters angel-like beings that have been battling the undead in an ages-old war that goes undetected to humans. Clarys mother (Lena Headey) is in peril the girl sees murderous acts and her dorky/hot best friend - even the nerds have fantastic abs in this film - doesnt believe her. Clary joins forces with Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) who leads a team of shadowhunters fighting the traitor Valentine who can summon the undead. Actors Jared Harris and C.C.H. Pounder offer some adult supervision as the aforementioned librarian and a witch. Bower is a feral often compelling presence and the script wisely takes itself seriously only 85 percent of the time. Theres a cool detail where shadowhunters tattoo themselves with runes allowing them to cast spells. But just when a moment starts to feel like fun someone opens a secret portal and then talks about it for five minutes. So much explanation in this film. The source material for ""M.I."" (it keeps getting shorter ...) was 485 pages long and it feels as if every detail was crammed in the movie. Clary is also a problem. No doubt she develops into a capable and resourceful heroine in the five volumes so far in the book series. But shes a bit sniveling and a drag here. Too much of the action is propelled by her incompetence whether shes screaming out loud when she should be quiet or breaking a dish when she should be stealthy. Think a younger cuter more goth Mr. Smith from ""Lost in Space."" The responsibility falls in part upon director Harald Zwart who fell into the trap of faithfully translating the book without considering the cinematic ramifications. You say Bach existed to fight demons? Then maybe novels exist just so fans can say ""I liked the book better than the movie."" The makers of ""MI"" should have accepted that and abandoned the near-impossible dream of a film that feels exactly like the novel. Once again the established fan base will probably adore this movie because it was made for them. And while doing that the filmmakers squandered an opportunity to ease a broader demographic into this world. Keep it simple keep it entertaining and if at all possible under 110 minutes. Even a downworlder knows that. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

"Review Mortal Instruments film needs major repairs - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Mortal Instruments film needs major repairsBy Randy MyersCorrespondentPosted 08/21/2013 033039 AM PDTUpdated 08/21/2013 033046 AM PDT""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" accomplishes a stunning feat. This first entry in a film franchise based on a popular young-adult book series is so bad it makes the ""Twilight"" saga look like ""The Godfather"" by comparison.""City of Bones"" is laughable in all the wrong places and clumsy as it overexplains its cluttered mythology at some moments but shortchanges the story line at others. It proves that not all young-adult book series are created equal especially when Hollywood gets its mitts on them. Be wary fans of the Cassandra Clare book series. I saw the movie with two people who loved the novels but trashed the movie. The overstuffed plot about Clary (Lily Collins) a Brooklyn lass who taps into her supernatural mojo throws in the prerequisite werewolves and vampires. Cant these guys just go into hibernation already?Thankfully these critters arent the main attraction. They play second fiddle to Shadowhunters tattooed hotties -- for the most part -- assigned to protect the Mundane aka humans from demons. Mundanes cant see Shadowhunters but Clary -- whose superpowers are simmering on the back burner -- can.The Shadowhunters are often serious wear leather and seem to prefer shopping on Victorias Secret and Undergear websites. The hunkiest of them all -- Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) -- prefers to air out his chest while wearing a hoodie that looks like it was stolen off the ""Arrow"" TV set. Jace helps Clary sort out her tangled heritage which also catches the interest of a reclusive downstairs neighbor (""Warehouse 13s"" CCH Pounder) Advertisement The movie starts off choppy but interesting when mom (Lena Headey) gets kidnapped by two thugs with a shapeshifting demon dog (the films best special effect). Thereafter we learn of a magical cup that needs to be retrieved meet a renegade Shadowhunter named Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers who sweats up a storm) and get slapped with a plot twist that makes your skin crawl when youre not too busy laughing at how poorly its executed. The screenplay by Jessica Postigo Paquette insists on repeating the obvious and its occasional decent one-liners get drowned out by limp dialogue that explains and explains and explains. At one point near the climactic brawl that is all elbows and appendages one character shouts out words that are intended to wound -- that one character loves another. No duh big guy. Weve been wasting our time watching this thing for more than two hours. We knowSince this is a YA novel an obligatory but rather silly love triangle takes shape as clueless Clary hangs out with earnest Simon (Robert Sheehan) a cute but nerdy guy friend (isnt there always one?) who comes along for the ride and gets kidnapped briefly. This leads to a lame action sequence involving vampires and werewolves. Yawn. This film publicity image released by Screen Gems shows Jamie Campbell Bower as Jace left and Lilly Collins as Clary in a scene from ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones. (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Screen Gems Rafy) ( Rafy ) Director Harald Zwart (""The Karate Kid"" remake) fumbles and stumbles. It sometimes seems like hes just tagging all the bases. He even throws in a love song that is obviously meant to produce a chart-topping hit.His leads fail him too. Collins (""Mirror Mirror"") doesnt make much of an impression and she and Campbell Bower show no chemistry even though he delivers some humorous lines with deadpan style.This should serve as a warning. Hollywood needs to stop gobbling up any YA novel it hopes will replicate ""Twilight."" Earlier this year the much better ""Beautiful Creatures"" came out and landed with a thud. Rent that one on DVD; its leagues better than this.Hollywood has more than enough high-caliber young adult lit to mine. Filmmakers should tap into richer human stories. We mere mortals would dearly appreciate it.The mortal instruments City of Bones  Rating PG-13 (fantasy violence suggestive language and content)Cast Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Kevin Zegers Robert Sheehan CCH Pounder Jonathan Rhys Meyers Jared Harris Aidan TurnerDirector Harold ZwartRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Aug. 21 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Mar. 19 2014 454PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Harold Zwart Written by Jessica Postigo Paquette Starring Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Robert Sheehan Year 2013 Country USA Language English Now that the supernatural romance series Twilight has faded into darkness and Harry Potter has vanquished Voldemort studios are grasping for copycat opportunities. Cassandra Clares six-part Mortal Instruments series (five have been published so far) seems to offer much thats familiar including vampires werewolves and even some demon hunters. This first episode of what threatens to be a franchise (a sequel is already announced) suggests Twilight Harry Potter and The Da Vinci Code were run through a blender and served lukewarm. Once again a moody adolescent discovers she is from an ancient race with special powers. Lily Collins (daughter of Phil Collins) plays Clary Fray a New York teenager who goes to poetry readings and draws and squabbles with her mom; until one evening she discovers shes no mere ""mundane"" (Mortal Instruments answer to Harry Potters ""muggles""). Instead shes a Shadowhunter a race of angelic assassins dropped on earth during the Crusades to fight the shape-shifting demons that are among us.The plot follows Clarys attempts to find her kidnapped mother (Lena Headey) and to recover a ""Mortal Cup"" of obscure powers. Sticking to the romance formula shes torn between two men the nerdy best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) and the sinewy blond supernatural boy Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) who introduces Clary to her new supernatural life and helps unblock her memory.Collins (Mirror Mirror) is a pale young English beauty with caterpillar eyebrows and an unfortunate tendency to let her mouth hang open when other characters are speaking. That happens all too often here as a parade of supernatural androgynous men explain the storys convoluted mythology. The line-up includes Alec (Kevin Zegers) who has a repressed gay crush on Jace; the kinky warlock Magnus Bane (Godrey Gao); the professorial Jared Harris as Jaces tutor; and Jonathan Rhys Meyers as an ambiguous figure who blends Star Wars Darth Vader and The Rocky Horror Picture Shows Dr. Frankenfurter.Within this bloated fantasy hodgepodge there are few grace notes In the role of the creepy fortune teller Madame Dorothea CCH Pounder (Law amp; Order Special Victims Unit) is evil fun. And a few special effects including a Rottweiller who turns into a skinned hellhound leave an impression. Otherwise Mortal Instruments manages to occupy 130 minutes of frantic numbing activity.

(Rafy Photography) By Stephanie Merry August 20 2013 Follow stephmerry Sony Pictures didnt wait for the release of "" The Mortal Instruments City of Bones "" to announce plans for a sequel. Lets hope the filmmakers learn at least a few lessons from this first adaptation of the popular teen fantasy series of novels. To be fair there are elements worth celebrating. The movie is thankfully less self-serious than the mopey ""Twilight"" films. ""The Mortal Instruments"" revels in its own camp. But there is plenty of room for improvement. The action flick is overly long complicated and even by teen romance standards cringe-worthy in its cheesiness. Based on a series of novels by Cassandra Clare ""The Mortal Instruments"" story feels like a mash-up of ""Twilight"" and ""Harry Potter."" The main protagonist is Clary (Lily Collins) a seemingly typical teenager who begins drawing strange symbols in her sleep and seeing violent images that her best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) cannot. It turns out Clary is a shadow hunter or a half-human half-angel predestined to track and kill demons. Her realization coincides with the disappearance of her mother (Lena Headey) another such vigilante whos been masquerading as a bohemian artist in Brooklyn. To find her mom Clary teams up with Simon and another shadow hunter the snarky smoldering Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower). Their quest coincides with the demon-killer networks larger goal of finding a magical cup that could save or destroy humanity; Clarys mother was the only person who knew its whereabouts but the information may also be hiding somewhere in Clarys cloudy memory. The plot gets more convoluted from there with vampires werewolves witches and grotesque oozy monsters joining the mix. The special effects are good for the most part and the chase scenes are thrilling. If only it were clearer what everyone was running from and why. But one narrative is easy to follow Clary and Jace are falling in love while Simon is also enamored of Clary and shadow hunter Alec (Kevin Zegers) has eyes for Jace. The characters are plucky and quick-witted which is a welcome change from the brooding Edward Cullen and monotone Bella Swan. Simon has a wry sense of humor and Jace offers up his hokey lines with a knowing wink. Even Clary admits at one point the puzzling intricacies of the plot when she says ""This is so confusing."" If only shed acknowledged the corniness when she and Jace share an intimate late-night moment in a greenhouse amid blooming computer-generated flowers and twinkling lights. When an overhead sprinkler system turns on drenching the pair during their first kiss is it a sly nod to romantic shlock or just another example of it? There were loads of laughs during an early screening of the film but it was difficult to tell whether the movie was vying for them or not. ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones""  PG-13.

Based on Cassandra Clares hugely popular series of young-adult sci-fi/fantasy/romance novels the overstuffed but decent film stars Lily Collins (Mirror Mirror) as Clary Fray -- a seemingly ordinary auburn-haired New York teenager who develops a paranormal gift that allows her to see cryptic symbols invisible to other mortals (called ""mundanes"") like her platonic best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan). What gives? Quite a lot actually. Theres so much mythology to cover that you might want to strap in. It turns out that Clarys mother (Lena Headey) is a Shadowhunter an underworld race of half-angel warriors who are the last line of defense between our world and the shape-shifting demons who would happily eat our clueless kind for lunch. When Clarys mother is kidnapped by a gang of demonic goons searching for a magical chalice Clary joins up with a group of fashionably hip androgynous Shadowhunters. One of them is the dreamy Jace (Twilights Jamie Campbell Bower) a tattooed blond bad boy who looks he stepped out of a dewy Spandau Ballet video. (Hey its possible -- hes been alive for a thousand years.) As the films heroine Collins does a good job as an innocent girl-next-door-turned-demon-slaying badass. She juggles rock-em sock-em action numbers (clad in thigh-high leather boots) and the kinds of schmaltzy Harlequin romance scenes that will get the pulses of teen girls the world over racing. It doesnt hurt that shes surrounded by the kind of hammy scenery-chomping Brits (Jared Harris and Jonathan Rhys Meyers) for whom movies like this seem tailor-made. For the uninitiated some head-scratching will be inevitable. The thickets of mystical mumbo-jumbo plot points are hard to keep straight (are the vampires working with or against the werewolves? And where do the warlocks fit in?). But director Harald Zwart (2010s The Karate Kid) mostly keeps the derivative CGI-packed City of Bones fizzy and fast on its feet -- at least until the final act which seems to go on forever in its attempt to set up the sequel. And make no mistake there will be a sequel. Clary may not wind up having the same pop-culture impact as Bella and Katniss but like it or not this wont be the last time you hear from her.

Area theaters. What makes an instrument ""mortal"" is still a little vague in ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" the newest wanna-be ""Twilight."" But one things for certain This particular instrument is way out of tune. This one is by far the worst of the ""Twilight"" copies. And when that bunch includes ""The Host"" and ""I Am Number Four"" thats saying something. Lily Collins Clary is just a typical teen gal living in the cheapo movie version of New York City. Shes starting to have visions and finds herself drawing glyphs that strangely resemble the onetime Twisted Sister logo. After she and chum Simon (Robert Sheehan doing his best Jay Baruchel imitation) find goth kids with British accents chasing them they enter the world of Shadowhunters. Turns out Clary is not a mere ""Mundane"" (think ""Muggles"" but more boring). Her mother (Lena Headey who spends most of the movie literally asleep) is part of a society of demon fighters sworn to protect various ""mortal instruments"" from the clutches of baddies. But now that shes been mom-napped its up to Clary Simon and a very blond very brooding guy named Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) to battle some poorly rendered CGI creatures. From left Jemima West Kevin Zegers and Jamie Campbell Bower in Mortal Instruments City of Bones (Rafy) Despite an avalanche of back story the film is merely an excuse to hop from one spookily dressed set to another. Alas the titular City of Bones is more of a basement. Other than a gag about a cache of weapons beneath every church altar theres hardly a moment of levity or imagination. For a film that is wall-to-wall fantasy youve seen all of this before in much better movies. Laughs come by the third act but theyre of the so-bad-its-good kind. Allegedly revelatory lines like ""You are a Morgenstern"" dont quite have the intended impact especially for moviegoers old enough to remember TVs ""Rhoda."" When the elder statesman role is played by Jared Harris one has to wonder how many British stage actors politely said ""No thank you."" Lily Collins and Jamie Campbell Bower explore secrets in the Shadowhunters world in The Mortal Instruments City of Bones. (Rafy) However author Cassandra Clares book series is wildly popular with four sequels and three prequels to ""Bones"" already published and more on the way. So even with this film suffering from cinematic osteoporosis we may get another visit like it or not. On mobile?

Thats most of what I remember about seeing ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" the opening installment in a new teen-oriented fantasy franchise that makes few concessions to outsiders. As directed by Harald Zwart (of the ""Karate Kid"" remake) and scripted by Jessica Postigo Paquette this is a cheerful high-energy screen adaptation of the best-selling young-adult novel by Cassandra Clare that may fill the post-Potter post-""Twilight"" void if only on a temporary basis. Its an episodic yarn about half-angelic ""Shadowhunters"" arrayed with and against vampires werewolves and demons that arrives at the tail end of summer when its target audience is presumably home from the beach but not yet back in the classroom.With its blend of romance action magic and bits and pieces of supernatural hoo-ha imported from other sources - the Potterverse and ""Twilight"" most obviously but also ""Star Wars"" ""Avatar"" ""Lord of the Rings"" and the ""Blade"" and ""Underworld"" series - this initial ""Mortal Instruments"" picture has the vibe of a straight-to-video release from the mid-90s except with a 60 million budget and considerable special-effects expertise. Its young stars have the right feeling of almost-famous beauty and anonymity Lily Collins whos had supporting roles in ""The Blind Side"" and ""Stuck in Love"" plays Clary Fray a New York teenager who discovers that her missing mom has been concealing her true identity heritage destiny etc. Clarys principal foils are a blond brooding Anglo Shadowhunter named Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower who has appeared in both the ""Potter"" and ""Twilight"" series) and her mildly nebbishy ""mundane"" would-be boyfriend Simon (Robert Sheehan of the British teen series ""Misfits"" and the Irish crime series ""Love/Hate""). [This is a correction I previously had this character confused with Alec played by Kevin Zegers.]Its evidently important in this kind of universe to present the young female protagonist with sexual dichotomies as with the choice between the preening narcissistic Jace who is liable to play a Bach fugue or kiss her in an enchanted garden at midnight and the loyal but thoroughly chaste Simon who at one point gets abducted by vampires and strung up in what looks very much like an S/M bondage club. Jace is like all possible genders at once Simon none at all. This series also continues the ""Twilight"" tradition of making parental figures seem inordinately young thereby suggesting perverse possibilities that may (or may not) be unintentional. In this case Lena Headey who plays Clarys mother (and has lately been seen as Cersei Lannister on ""Game of Thrones"") is 15 years older than Lily Collins although they could easily pass for sisters. Jonathan Rhys Meyers (Henry VIII on ""The Tudors"") meanwhile plays Valentine a Shadowhunter who has gone to the dark side in some confusing fashion and who may or may not be Clarys dad and hes only about 10 years older than Collins. You Might Also Like But of course all these people are angels or semi-angels or in Clarys case semi-demi-angels so even though they can die maybe they dont age normally? Its safe to say there was a lot about this movie I didnt quite get. What I did grasp is that Clary thinks shes a normal New York teenager - that is a normal New York teenager who lives in a neighborhood that is clearly in suburban Toronto - until she starts drawing weird rabbit-head glyphs and having fragmentary memories and attracting the attention of Jace whom ""mundanes"" like Alec cant even see. The lady who lives on the ground floor of her building (CCH Pounder) is a witch and Clary gets drawn into a literally underground New York scene dressing in discount fetish gear and hanging out in a decrepit sub-Hogwarts place called the Institute presided over by an untrustworthy looking tweedy fellow called Hodges (Jared Harris who played Lane Pryce on ""Mad Men""). Shadowhunters are half-human guardians trying to save the earth from demons you see or all of them except Valentine who has defected to the demon team and wants to find a Holy Grail-type artifact whose whereabouts Clarys mom may have hidden in Clarys mind or something. I quite enjoyed ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" in patches like the super-creepy scene when Clary has to enter the catacombs where all former Shadowhunters are interred presided over by some corpse-like monk-dudes with stitched-up mouths in order to get her repressed memories back. But a lot of it is super-generic fight scenes and Clary not quite getting to kiss Jace for various reasons and you almost never get that feeling of specific gravity of commitment to the universe that was present even in the most extreme dumbass moments of the ""Twilight"" and ""Potter"" movies. I imagine fans of Clares books will find this movie largely satisfactory but its distinctly a rush job an almost random collection of sexy-supernatural teen signifiers aimed at squeezing the penultimate dollars out of a declining trend. Theres something almost cool about that. (But OK not quite.) Follow More Andrew OHehir.

VPC Scott Bowles USA TODAY 721 p.m. EDT August 20 2013Despite some effective action scenes The Mortal Instruments gets jammed up on derivative story lines and one-dimensional characters.Lily Collins plays Clary Fray a half-angel Shadowhunter in The Mortal Instruments City of Bones.(Photo Rafy)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  1/2 out of fourStars Lily Collins Lena Headey Jonathan Rhys Myers Jamie Campbell Bower Jemima WestRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 10 minutes; Opens Wednesday nationwideThe Mortal Instruments City of Bones cant decide which franchise it wants to ape Twilight Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings.So it tries to mimic all three leaving this young-adult novel adaptation ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Wednesday nationwide) with a nasty split personality. Though it has flashes of promise Bones traces the footsteps of its fantasy film predecessors too closely to blaze anything close to an original narrative.Based on the first book of the six-novel series by Cassandra Clare Bones tells the story of Clary Fray (Lily Collins) a New York teen entering that awkward demon phase. Seems that everywhere she turns Clary finds warlocks werewolves and just about every creature to grace an Abbott amp; Costello movie; shes like Buffy the vampire seer.After an effectively staged demon-angel battle involving Clarys mom Jocelyn (Game of Thrones Lena Headey) Clary learns that she is the descendant of a line of Shadowhunters a secret society of half-angel soldiers who protect the world from demons (though not zombies -- those are silly Hollywood creations apparently).VIDEO Collins on Mortal Instruments vs. TwilightREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersIt doesnt take long for Clary to team up with a band of humans and angel hybrids that could have come from Hogwarts grad school Theres dorky Simon (Robert Sheehan) the sidekick who provides the laughs; Isabelle (Jemima West) the sexy Shadowhunter to keep the fanboys interested; and Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) the Shadowhunter love interest who is meant to stir memories of Robert Pattinson but looks a lot like a male Kate Moss.Together they head to an alternate New York called Downworld which is a lot like the regular New York but with worse bathrooms. There the evil Valentine (Jonathyn Rhys Meyers) awaits.If Bones finds a rhythm its when the film takes cues from The Lord of the Rings particularly its demon soldiers. The movie is slickly shot briskly paced and replete with expensive effects.But director Harald Zwart (The Karate Kid reboot) drains anything approaching tension. This is a film geared to audiences not quite ready for The Hunger Games and Bones wont test kids nerves. At slightly over two hours though it will test parents resolve to remain awake.Credit Bones with putting female characters in first-rate action scenes. But even they cant overcome writing that occasionally borders on monstrous. 105 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 20 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/164o18hSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

Evil Once More With (So Much) Feeling Facebook Twitter Google+ Email August 20 2013600 PM ET Mark Jenkins Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) and Clary (Lilly Collins) are Shadowhunters -- they are teens and they are special -- in the first of a threatened series of half a dozen films based on Cassandra Clares Mortal Instruments novels for young adults. Or perhaps at 2 hours 10 minutes this is all six films. We may have misunderstood. Rafy/Sony/Screen Gems hide caption toggle caption Rafy/Sony/Screen Gems The Mortal Instruments City of Bones Director Harald Zwart Genre Adventure Fantasy Running Time 130 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action and some suggestive content With Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Lena Heady Jemima West CCH Pounder Jonathan Rhys Meyers Jared Harris Its time for mom and Clary to have the talk. No not that talk. Jocelyn (Lena Headey) needs to tell teenage Clary (Lily Collins) about angels and demons vampires and werewolves magic chalices and sacred blood -- not to mention hidden sanctuaries interdimensional portals the identity of her father and the existence of an unknown brother. Plus something nutty about J.S. Bach. No wonder shes been putting it off. Too late now The Mortal Instruments City of Bones has begun Jocelyns in a self-induced coma and Clary is being pursued through a New York that looks a lot like Toronto. When it doesnt look like a generic CGI monsterland. There are five more novels -- one as yet unpublished -- in the series that inspired this combined beast-impaler/bodice-ripper. But its hard to imagine whats left to throw in the hopper This installment already features hefty chunks of the Twilight saga a few dollops of Harry Potter and bits of Arthurian legend all upholstered in fashions that might have shamed Siouxsie and the Banshees. (Note to filmmakers Having your teenage protagonist complain that shes dressed like a hooker doesnt excuse dressing her like a hooker.) At the beginning Clary is an auburn-haired aspiring artist whos begun to draw runes though with neither intention nor understanding. She and Simon (Robert Sheehan) the chum who wants to be so much more visit a Goth-style disco. There Clary realizes that she can see people no one else can. Well not people exactly; more like models from some 80s Helmut Newton photo shoot. Some of them are demons passing for human the rest angels who are half-human. The latter are called Shadowhunters and Clary it will turn out is one of them. Mom didnt mention that either. Poor Simon is just a muggle known in this supernatural subdivision as a ""mundane."" But hes sure to get transformed although a demotion seems as likely as an upgrade. i Jace helps Clary as she sets about uncovering the truth about her unsuspected heritage as one of the chosen few who defend humans from things supernatural and also he is pretty and blond and dreamy and distracting. Rafy/Sony/Screen Gems hide caption toggle caption Rafy/Sony/Screen Gems Jace helps Clary as she sets about uncovering the truth about her unsuspected heritage as one of the chosen few who defend humans from things supernatural and also he is pretty and blond and dreamy and distracting. Rafy/Sony/Screen Gems There are only a few good Shadowhunters left apparently. In fact the City of Bones is a catacomb filled with the skeletons of their departed. But that wont be on the final exam since the movie spends only a few minutes there. Clary finds herself allied with Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) a pouty blond pretty-boy Shadowhunter who makes her all tingly. Thats problematic since whenever the battling stops so the potential couple can flirt the dialogue descends from the silly to the downright mortifying. One make-out session actually includes a Demi Lovato love ballad. Jace and his cohorts live in an invisible Hogwarts-like refuge -- impregnable of course but only until it isnt. Among the Evil Ones who might come knocking is archvillain Valentine played by Jonathan Rhys Myers who hasnt looked so much like David Bowie since he played a Bowie-like rocker in Velvet Goldmine. Valentine has a thing about blood thats part Satanism part Nazi eugenics. But to make his sanguinary cocktail he needs a Grail-like cup that Jocelyn has hidden. Clary as you will have suspected by now just might know where it is. Director Harold Zwart who did that Karate Kid remake with Will Smiths son handles this nonsense professionally The art direction is stylish the editing dynamic and the special effects respectable. There are even a handful of witty moments. If only Zwart could have handled the mushy stuff without words City of Bones might have escaped being laughable. If only. Aside from the giggles induced by the romance-novel bits the movies principal hazard is exhaustion. There are too many characters and too many of them spend too much time morphing into something else. Five more like this? That would be demonic.

Set in a world of scantily clad demon hunters bisexual warlocks and a host of vampires and werewolves apparently on loan from ""The Twilight Saga"" ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is a ludicrous borderline-nonsensical supernatural concoction with a slightly redeeming sense of its own silliness. Even by the genres lax standards of plausibility not a whole lot coheres in this first adaptation of Cassandra Clares bestselling urban-fantasy series a muddled mash-up of Stephenie Meyer J.K. Rowling and Joss Whedon with a little ""Men in Black"" thrown in for good measure. While its tattooed torsos fantastical f/x and precociously kinky undertones suggest a focus groups notion of what teenagers want from their entertainment this Canadian-German co-production could have a hard time overcoming the B.O. curse of recent fantasy fare like ""Beautiful Creatures"" and ""Percy Jackson Sea of Monsters."" Still the Screen Gems release should benefit from a five-day opening weekend devoid of much direct competition.This story first appeared in the August 27 2013 issue of Variety.

The next film in the series ""The Mortal Instruments City of Ashes"" is already set to begin production this fall with director Harald Zwart (""The Karate Kid"" ""The Pink Panther 2"" ""Agent Cody Banks"") back at the helm suggesting a measure of studio confidence that will be adjusted upward or downward depending on how ""City of Bones"" performs. Still at a bloated 130 minutes this overstuffed f/x extravaganza has that desperate cram-it-all-in quality typical of a franchise-starter wannabe suggesting the work of individuals not entirely convinced theyll be back for the sequel or that there will even be a sequel. Jessica Postigo Paquettes screenplay all but crumbles beneath the weight of its convoluted mythology and hormonal melodrama as well as its narrative obligations as an origin story of sorts. The film spends an inordinate length of time waiting for dark-haired Clary (Lily Collins) to realize that although she likes to argue with her mother (Lena Headey) and attend crappy poetry readings with her nerdy best friend (Robert Sheehan) she is not strictly speaking just an average New York teenager. In fact shes descended from a long line of Shadowhunters a race of magically gifted leather-clad fighters who do battle with the demons that walk undetected among mankind. One of the reasons Clary belongs in the Shadowhunters company is that she can see them a gift not granted to ordinary muggles (er ""mundanes"" as theyre called here). And what a sight they are Clarys guide to this invisible world of rites and ruins is Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) a mildly androgynous blond heartthrob whose presence more than that of any witch or vampire is what primarily defines this story as a fantasy. Jace is lusted after not only by Clary but also by his Shadowhunter buddy Alec (Kevin Zegers) who nonetheless keeps his desires under wraps. Far less inhibited is Magnus Bane (Taiwanese model-actor Godfrey Gao) drolly described as ""the high warlock of Brooklyn""; his first appearance in heavy guyliner piercings and a disturbing blazer-and-boxers combo is a thing of very dark magic indeed. That scene sets up the films subtlest joke suggesting it can be hard to tell the difference between a supernatural shindig and certain enclaves of New York nightlife. (The costumes were designed by Gersha Phillips.) These outre touches and flashes of self-aware humor are what sustain passing interest in Zwarts film providing welcome distractions from its needlessly complicated none-too-intriguing story in which Clary tries to track down her missing mother and retrieve something called the Mortal Cup -- a much-coveted artifact whose specific properties remain an utter mystery even after youve heard everyone whisper about how important it is for the better part of two hours. The plot is essentially one long tease anyway; its established early on that Clarys knowledge of her Shadowhunter past has been deliberately suppressed a fairly convenient device from a screenwriting standpoint (its not a plot hole its a memory block). In short ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is the sort of frenetic fantasy that piles on the pyrotechnics the prosthetics and the simpering romantic interludes in lieu of any genuine sense of wonder or emotion. Those who fall outside the films intended viewership may pass the time by contemplating the surprising sexual conservatism of the Shadowhunter universe or perhaps the curious resemblance between Jace and a character from a far superior epic franchise (Cassandra Clare achieved her early fame as a popular and controversial figure in Harry Potter fan-fiction circles). Even when the story requires her to dress up like a fetish-ball Cinderella Collins cant do much to engage our attention in a character who is by turns stubborn angsty indecisive and a bit slow on the uptake; having previously played Snow White in ""Mirror Mirror"" the actress may want to reconsider taking on too many films of this ilk in which she is not allowed to be the most compelling thing onscreen. As one of Clarys two love interests Bower sells his brooding-Brit act persuasively enough and wields a sword handily in the generally incoherent action sequences. On the adult side of the equation Headey is a fiercely watchable presence in her too-brief moments; CCH Pounder and ""Mad Mens"" Jared Harris enliven the proceedings as vaguely sinister characters operating on the storys periphery; and Jonathan Rhys Meyers momentarily jolts the film awake as a louche Shadowhunter who expands the films stew of pop-cultural influences to include ""Star Wars."" Much of the pictures relatively modest budget seems to have been applied toward scenes of metamorphosis in which hitherto benign characters suddenly shift into demon mode while some of the more bizarre gadgets on display -- a fire-generating pentagram a glowing aquatic memory portal -- are well visualized by the f/x team even when the script is at a loss to explain their purpose. As ever Toronto makes a workmanlike stand-in for New York while production designer Francois Seguin brings rote but effective Gothic touches to bear on his sets for the Institute (the Shadowhunters Hogwarts-style safe house) and the underground catacombs that explain the second half of the films ungainly title. Atli Orvarssons unmemorable score is supplemented with snippets of Bachs Goldberg Variations which tie into one of the scripts better gags. Incidentally in a departure from usual practice the Los Angeles press screening of ""City of Bones"" was preceded by a trailer for Sonys upcoming ""One Direction This Is Us"" while the screening of ""One Direction This Is Us"" was preceded by a trailer for ""City of Bones"" -- all presumably to maximize awareness among two target audiences with a fair amount of overlap.

Brian says December 15 2015 at 930 pm Just worthless compared to the books Reply Brian says December 15 2015 at 921 pm What where you thinking twighlight you had to make this beyond twighlight this city of bones was cheesy.. the book was amazing find a true producer to make this soooo amazing Reply Christian Grey says December 3 2015 at 159 am I love ""City of Bones"".. Also the most exciting novel for the youngsters these days. What is it ? its fifty sahdes of grey  I just read the book and totally in love with the way Author has expressed her self. Great imagination. So waiting to to watch the movie now Reply seaira crowells says May 12 2015 at 1016 am city of bones is an amazing movie cant wait to see city of ashes Reply Danielle DePriest says September 8 2013 at 714 am Part 2 .... please Mission accomplished I was left wanting more Reply Annette Faucheux says September 2 2013 at 253 pm Looking forward to the follow up movie Reply marie says September 1 2013 at 1011 pm Ok... I LOVED THE BOOKS Cassandra is one of my favorite authors and The Mortal Instruments amp; The Infernal Devices are the best books I have ever read. In my opinion its nothing like twilight. There are many books that have vampires and werewolfs so why does it has to be copying twilight? An about the love triangle is nothing like twilight either. Jace is a Shadowhunter not a vampire Simon is a human not a werewolf and Clarissa is a Shadowhunter(just like Jace) not a human. And copying HP because of the muggles? Wellmostly every fictional world has humans and in TMI amp; TID they are called Mundanes not Muggles. And Im pretty sure neither Magnus Bane nor Ragnor Fell uses a wand to do magic. About the movie.... I like it but it was not what I expected. I expected better. It tried so hard to be funny that some important deatils were jumped. It annoy me the fact that Simon didnt turned into a rat nobody metioning Idris poor deatils about the Uprising no Valentine vs. Luke fight no Jace REALLY believing that Valentine is his father and Clary his sister no portal showing Idris and breaking into crystalsno portal at Madame Dorothea no Jace taking a pice of portal showing Idris no Jace going to the hospital to see Jocelyn (because clary thought that Jocelyn will wake up if she hears Jaces voice). And they should have made the viewer be sure that Jocelyn is in a complete comma so that tells the viewer like SORRY SHES IN COMMA YOU NEED TO WATCH THE NEXT MOVIE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS) And it needed more Jace/Clary scenes(romance). And at last they REALLY needed to let clary kill the demon that is at her house that would have shown that she is really brave AND THE FIGHT WAS NOT IN THE INSTITUTE and the institute was not suppose to be destroyed plus Hodge was suppose to flew away because he is a coward. BUT I still think the movie was pretty cool. And I will watch it again ;) I just really hope that if there will be a second part they had to make it better (not so funny).. City of Ashes is more about trying to discover who you are and trying to wake your mom (both Clary and Jace). And they have to make the people hate Imogen Herondale(the Inquisitor).. so that they never forget who she is because she is a very important character(in my opinion)... so that when (spoiler) Jace discovers who he really is in city of glass the people remembers Imogen and they have to be like OMG THAT BTCH IS HIS GRANDMAAAA... and they have to put all of the scenes of simon/vampire And they have to mention Idris and show the Clave Im really looking forward to City Of Ashes. I hope they make it... by the way this is just my opinion. Reply amy holland says August 28 2013 at 941 am i absolutely love this serious...of course the book and movie are going to be different..i expected that..i missed simon turning into a rat...but oh well..i expected clary to be a nerd so to speak and isabelle to be drullingly sexy...an I found clary sexier than her...if anything to be different more on clary and jace ( Im reading city of ashes and am waiting to be told the truth that they arent bro and sis I wanna see them in a sex scene) and more in detail as the book was with the shawdowhunter history and world..also a little bit more on valentine and Jocelyn..want to see more in detail of each downworlder environment as well...over all I absolutely love city of bones and find my self wanting more from clary and jace...love those 2 Reply WonderingY They Jackedupmymovie says August 27 2013 at 448 pm Jace was painfully skinny Magnus was boring and flat Isabelle is supposed to drip sex appeal and she didnt and Valentine bore absolutely NO resemblance to his description in the book. And lets talk about the fight scenes... Jace is supposed to be a superior shadowhunter. It seemed to me like he was getting thrown about quite a bit until he got to his fight scene with Valentine. And why did Valentine have those horrible braids in his hair? Really? All this talk of HG Twilight and Harry Potter... Valentine looked more like a knock off of Tom Cruise in Rock of Ages. Just made me sad. Smh. Please dont make a part 2 until u fix all of your flaws Revisit Valentine and Magnus Reply themortalinstrumentswillfailsohard says August 26 2013 at 126 pm How DARE you even MENTION Joss Whedon in this redonkulous artical about this stupid movie I want to forget before it even comes out. Shame on you. Reply jayedee says August 26 2013 at 818 am Ok well i have just watched ""TMI"" ""City Of Bones and iam currently reading ""City Of Lost Souls"" so i figured i might as well add my own two cents worth since everybody has an opinion and is entitled to it right? Ok so the books i have really enjoyed as well as been a little frustrated by but you get that as with most things in life but as for the movie well iam slightly dissappointed for the obvious reasons of being a lot of key details being left out but regardless i still loved the movie. And as for the movie being compared to big name productions of the likes of ""Harry Potter"" or ""Twilight"" i can see similarities but only slight ones and ""TMI"" IS completely on its own in its own way. Now iam NOT a tween nor a teen and iam absolutely in love with fantasy/fiction books/movies and the reason being is for the escape it gives me to an amazing world of the imagination....unfortunately what quite a few people are lacking in then you have these awesome authors with these wild imaginations that if you let them take you on a wonderous journey of the mind and it doesnt matter which genre you love more wether it be book/movie? So am i a hardcore fan??? Well the answer is a big FAT ""YES"" of nigh all fanasty based literature YA novels ""YES"" and iam 31. There is not enough fantasy based movies made from books let alone that are made well. We as a whole have more than enough of ""Horror"" ""Action""  ""Drama""  ""Comedy""  ""Thriller"" ""Indie""  ""Porn"" and unfortunately ""Reality Shows"" if i wanted to watch real life drama queens id go for a walk......and see plenty. Anyway thats just my opinion. Reply themortalinstrumentswillfailsohard says August 26 2013 at 130 pm You need to grow up and try reading an actual book for a change you are 31 and still having wet dreams about vampires and werewolves? Get over yourself go read Tolkien oh wait it would be too much for your tiny simplistic mind to comprehend. There are no shirtless teens chasing after young girls / Reply maxh says August 28 2013 at 1013 am Oh nice. Im 30 and I love reading YAF (except Twilight - urgh) especially when it is well written and imaginitve. And yeah I am a fantasy geek so I have indeed read (and reread) Tolkein Brooks Zelazny et al. You dont seem to understand that some of us can have eclectic reading tastes and arent defined by what we should read but what we enjoy reading. Berk. brad says August 24 2013 at 722 am As of Sat morning it looks like a bomb thank God. Reply angel says August 24 2013 at 637 am If you want more information on why this movie is so bad and why its based on crappy original text read this review. http//theweek.com/article/index/248587/girls-on-film-the-confounding-problems-of-fan-fiction. It will give you the insight to see this movie for the sub-par crap that it is. Reply Monica says August 23 2013 at 652 pm Alright I must say that Jane Austen is my favorite author and Ive read classic literature. If you look in my kindle you will find more classics lit than anything else So I dont think its fair to say that if young adults read more books in this context they would understand why TMI sucks... I love Cassandra Clare and for you to say her writing is bad is pretty messed up. Im not ashamed to say she is one of my favorite authors. And about the movie being bad? It wasnt too bad. I liked that they actually got most of the stuff from the book into the movie. Yea they changed a few things but not so much that you cant even tell where the book plot is. Im a person who HATES book to movie adaptations and I didnt mind seeing this movie. The only thing that was bad about the movie was that they totally told everyone that clary and have arent siblings. Other than that there isnt much to cry about Yea and for those who say young people should read more classic literature I picked up Dantes Inferno because of Cassandra Clare not to mention A Tale of Two Cities. Which by the way I hated the first time I read it. If she can make me pick up another good book then why the heck not keep reading. Reply Paula Middagh says August 22 2013 at 719 pm Most of the reviews are bad because people you comment in opening week are obviously hardcore fans. I didnt like the movie so much because Ive read the series and it was amazing. I was already expecting this movie to be awfull but it wasnt. If you see all the bad comments are about the differences between the book and the movie. You cant expect the movie to be as good as the film Im pretty sure anyone who hasnt read the books would enjoy this movie a lot. It was done beautifully and they kept some of the original lines (which made the script not so bad) the acting was good and the soundtrack was fine. Even though there werent flying motorcycles and the plot and ending were different the movie was good and any bad comments about it are from a fan who has just arrived from the theater and its angry as hell. Like I was. Reply Aimee says August 22 2013 at 1253 pm As a Mortal Instruments lover who has read the series numerous times I was infuriated by the movie. I was seriously ready to walk out after 30mins. I understand things may need to be altered or put into a different order so people who havent read the series can understand what is going on but to take extremely poignant scenes and change EVERYTHING is ridiculous. They COMPLETELY 100% altered the ending and straight up told you the biggest bombshell of the series is a lie. The screenplay writer needs to be told to find a new profession. Thank you for destroying an amazing work of fiction by turning it into a mockery and a joke. J.H. Bach as a Shadowhunter?? Youve gotta be freaking kidding me. Every detail Paquette ""added"" to the story did nothing but detract from it. I know there are a lot of details and in depth mythologies societies and cultures but Harry Potter proved that it is possible to convey all of these things in the ""show dont tell"" manner a rule which Paquette blatantly ignored. All of what made these books amazing was traded for pointless action scenes that did nothing to add to the story (and werent in the original anyways). I cant see how true fans of this series are anything but disappointed. Reply Lilly says August 26 2013 at 133 pm I could not agree with you more i am only back from seeing it and was disgusted dont get me wrong they had some scenes from the book but changing the ending and were things took place I was so annoyed and I too was tempted to leave the cinema they destroyed it Most of it made no bloody sense especially to someone who hasnt read the books And now they have started making the second one dont think i will be going to see that if its anything like this Reply Gabs says August 22 2013 at 718 am This movie is not Twilight-esque. It is not Harry Potter-ish. It is not a Hunger Games. It is its own series. Yes it is aimed at teens/young adults. However I also believe it is aimed at fans of fantasy/fiction books like myself. I am way past my teens seeing as how I turn 31 in 2 days and have been waiting for this movie to come out. I read the book series three times amp; love it. After reading amp; seeing Beautiful Creatures which was horrifically disappointing I didnt let myself get my hopes up TOO high about this movie. But I LOVED it Sure there are A LOT of main points missing but the same goes for most ""book turned movie"" films. I do believe it is time for young people to be the review voice for films such as these. Reply pots says August 22 2013 at 620 am Im sick of hearing bad reviews about this movie i dont understand why its getting such negative feedback All the complaints about it seem to all be saying that it is copying off various other fantasy films like twilight and harry potter how ridiculous if you say that its like saying Percy jackson copies greek mythologhy or twilight copies dracula how is city of bones copying them just because there is magic and vampires doesnt mean its exacly like harry potter and twilight they are completly fucking differen how hard is it to understand mortal instruments is about shadow hunters last time i wachted harry potter im pretty sure there wasnt half angel half human beings fighting demonds in it the funny thing is that most of the bad reviews are adults last time i checked mortal instruments was aimed at young adults thats another things that really annoyed me and that goes for any book or film where people complain about them when they are not the intennded audience if youre going to read a book or film that is not aimed at you be warned that you may not enjoy it also this writer reallly irritated me by putting a host of vampires and werewolves apparently on loan from ""The Twilight Saga"" in which part of city of bones did the vampires sparkle? or the werewolves constantly take their shirts off? stop comparing books films when they are nothing alike or saying stuff like the next twilight i feel this film has been unfairly reviewed by people who are not the intended audience or are comparing it to other films and books and saying it stole ideas. look at every book and film can you say every idea in them are completely original? Reply Mystergirl says August 22 2013 at 831 pm Because oh slow one the books are heavily copied from fanfiction of harry potter hence the blatant similar(read stolen) material. Papers arent going to higher little teeny boppers who know little about accurately reviewing works to type up reviews.Movie critics no matter how old can discern between movies that are well worked and presented and claptrap. Everyday teens cannot. As a critic read that again in fact ill type that again CRITIC it is their job to make light of the positive AND negative aspects of the films. Almost every single review I read applauded the special effects. If all of these PROFESSIONAL movie critics all have the same ""issues"" with the film and the premise of it than these issues are actually there whether people like it or not. A true fan can distance themselves from the world of stanning and fandoms and call out bull shit when it appears. If my decision to read the book was based of this film on which I wasted 10 dollars I wouldnt pick up the book in fact Id turn in the opposite direction if I saw it. But since Ive already read it.... Im just thankfully that I read it from the library and didnt purchase the series. No matter how people want to spin it Cassandra Clare is a plagiarist on some levels. Using established characters from Harry Potter to write fanfiction is one thing[not to mention using many lines from tv shows with cult followings like BtVS without crediting them in her fanfics] but to then take entire passages from the fanfics your wrote based of characters you didnt create and use them in your professional work not to mention basing your characters BLATANTLY off of them is plagiarism. Her characters and storyline are the bad cliches.Yes HP was cliche on some points however the take on the idea was so originial and the world so intricately and creatively built that there were no faux pas as fat as cliches utilized. The same cant be said for TMI. Lets just say that if J.K and Joss Whedon really wanted to they just might be able to sue her and win but I digress. At the end of the day people are entitled to their opinion and while you may not like them its intelligent to be objective and not the atypical fangirl who will accept anything as good writing. If only teens today spent more time reading classic novels you know ones that are actually well written and not archaic theyd see why older people complain about these films and books[specifically Twilight and MTI] and this is coming from a 23yr. old. Reply daughterofagunn says August 24 2013 at 1015 pm Awesome response I read the book when I was in year 8 as in cant judge books for shit year eight but Im now in year ten and I can safely say that MTI has plummeted off my favorite books list but unfortunetly I have read the rest of the books so far and I need to say it sould have ended at number three number three would have been such a good ending and I couldnt help but feel as if Cassadra Clare was selling out with the next two instalment that was when I first heard about her plagarism yet I still read the rest of the books and still went to see the movie. I had suspected it would be terrible and wasnt far off. While the FX were great the music was excruciatingly over-the-top in some areas and the dialogue towards the end was outright make-me-gag ""Remember when I told you Id never seen an angel I lied."" is what I think they had Jace say which is a shame comsidering those completely cliched words (that sounds like the mumbled pick-up line of a drunk guy in a club before he throws-up on the pavement) had to be uttered from such an amazing actors mouth (Campbell-bower) it made me cringe. The costume design was shall we say sub-par I had kind of been hoping that they might go out of their way o actually design some runed-up gear for the shadow hunters instead slapping on some black jeans shirts and leather Jackets like every other bad-ass ever. although I have to say that I did like their take on the Silent Brothers but if you use your imagination and think about it the Silent Brothers arent that far a stretch from Voldemort if you equate a missing nose for missing eyes. And while the idea of half human half angels that demons may seem original and cool its basically just taking demon hunters (an idea used by many) and Nephilim (also used frequently in literature) and slapping a new title on for good measure. But I have to say that the movie wasnt exactly the worst Ive ever seen of adaptations I just hope and pray almost everyday that Divergent My favourite book series of all time is not ruined by its film adaptation it truely deserves more than that. But basically in a nut-shell to me the TMI series is like a cheeseburger I know its unhealthy and processed and yet I eat it anyway and hate myself after. the only thing I was glad about in this film is that they reaveled the Jace and Clary were NOT related many people seem utterly annoyed by this but these people need to remember that people outside the fan base will be seeing the film and INCEST is not exactly a good selling point for ANYTHING EVER Twelve says August 23 2013 at 950 pm Well said Cassandra Clare is a disgrace to proper writers. But her fangirls dont seem to care that shes a plagiarist (nor do her publishers...) or that her books are derivitive mind-numbing garbage. If kids think that these books pass for acceptable quality literature I seriously fear for the future of the book and film industries. This is the only review Ive read so far that has mentioned Clares past. I dont understand why people think plagiarism is okay or why it should be dismissed or even celebrated. It is not okay to steal others original work and pass it off as your own Plus if it were okay we would just be reading and watching the same thing over and over again. What a terrible world that would be. Oh wait.... Esteban Martinez says August 23 2013 at 728 am Best comment Ive read here. Absolutely spot on. samantha jones says August 21 2013 at 308 pm kiss my bum dude dont be jealous its an epic movie and a bad ass earth shattering book. you bloody MORON okay dont dissssssssssss just cause you dont have a talented bone in your entire body does mean you can degrade a work of art.

I guess. Those who care however will have already read the book and therefore cant be spoiled. When it comes to movies based on YA novels there are two flavors those designed exclusively for fans of the books (Twilight for example) and those that seek to draw in a wider (and possibly partially male) audience (The Hunger Games for example). The Mortal Instruments City of Bones is a card-carrying member of the former group. Only an aficionado of the source material could love this film and its made with that viewer in mind. The rest of us - unenlightened philistines who havent visited Cassandra Clares universe of angels demons witches vampires and werewolves - arent part of the box office success formula. That may sound cynical but if you see the movie youll understand the perspective. This is a negative review but it doesnt come from the pen of someone with a deep and abiding love for The Mortal Instruments saga. To its credit Jessica Postigo Paquettes screenplay makes some changes to the novel in order to provide more closure. If City of Bones was to be the only adaptation of a Mortal Instruments book at least it can be said to be reasonably self-contained. (This is highly unlikely since the sequel has already been greenlighted.) There are some ""hooks"" into future installments that are clumsily inserted and feel more like plot holes but at least the ending isnt an outright cliffhanger. The storyline is at times muddled and incoherent. This wont bother readers much since they have the ""inside track"" on whats happening. Then again the narrative is so predictable that maybe it doesnt matter. Most fantasy stories adhere to certain tropes - it creates a sense of comfortable familiarity. What separates good from bad in the genre are the details and the little delights. This is where City of Bones disappoints. It sticks so closely to the YA formula that it feels like a mashup of a watery fantasy with soap opera. Suds overflow. I was frankly reminded of Dark Shadows (the TV series not the movie). Will it cause surprise and consternation that theres a possible incestuous twist to the main love story? Not really. The movie diffuses this by having a secondary character explain the underlying ""lie."" And because The Mortal Instruments saga would have been excoriated by fans for not resolving this dilemma favorably one neednt be concerned about any icky brother/sister copulation. Although City of Bones ends with some lingering ambiguity about this relationship its more in the characters minds than the viewers. The movie takes place in New York. As anyone who has spent a fair amount of time there knows the city is full of demons. It takes someone with angel blood to see them however - like teenager Clary (Lily Collins) whos about to embark on an adventure that reveals her secret powers. When you think about it City of Bones could be seen as a superhero origin story. Throw in the romantic triangle and you have Spider-Man with a less interesting villain cheesier dialogue and no upside-down kiss. In between episodes related to her attempts to learn what it means to be a shadowhunter Clary bounces back and forth between the two guys who want to get into her pants. The first is Simon (Robert Sheehan) a nerdy ""mundane"" who is stuck in the friend zone. Then theres the hot often bare-chested Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) who gets Clarys juices going the way poor Simon never will. I suspect the average viewer will be more invested in the romantic triangle than the tired tale of how a megalomaniac shadowhunter named Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) wants to use Clarys secret talents to uncover a hidden relic called the ""Mortal Cup"" which is a key to immense power. Or something like that. Clary Jace and Simon are joined by two other shadowhunters Alec (Kevin Zegers) and Isabelle (Jemima West). There are also werewolves and vampires. Im guessing that future installments of The Mortal Instruments will have Simon turning into a vampire and hooking up with Isabelle. These developments are based on what could generously be described as unsubtle foreshadowing. Lily Collins is an attractive actress but theres not much evidence that her acting skills have advanced since Mirror Mirror. While sparks dont fly between her and Jamie Campbell Bower at least there are a few fitful embers. Lena Headey who has a supporting role as Clarys mother looks bored possibly because shes comparing City of Bones narrative trajectory with that of Game of Thrones. Jonathan Rhys Meyers seems to enjoy hamming it up even though the movies shaky foundation starts to crumble the moment he shows up. Jared Harris has a bizarre part; most of his scenes must have ended up on the cutting room floor because his character - the legendary shadowhunter Hodge - makes no sense whatsoever. The director is Harald Zwart whose unimpressive resume (Agent Cody Banks The Pink Panther 2 The Karate Kid remake) raises all manner of red flags. Sadly those are warranted. One scene that could have (and should have) crackled with suppressed sexual tension and playful rivalry - a trading of quips about Bach - feels rushed and doesnt have the necessary zing. Its a minor misstep but symptomatic of a larger problem. City of Bones lacks the energy and intelligence to achieve sufficient elevation above its overly familiar plot to make it worthy of the attention of anyone who hasnt fallen in love with Clares books. The only question remaining is whether the fan base is a large and thriving one like Twilights or an uncaring one like Beautiful Creatures. The answer to that question will reveal how many more of these movies were going to be subjected to.

"Review Super powers cant save Mortal Instruments City of Bones - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Super powers cant save Mortal Instruments City of Bones Mark Olsen Many of Hollywoods recent adaptations of young adult fiction are confounding They seem far more invested in the fantasy trappings and wonky internal mythology of their made-up universes than they are in the deeper metaphors of body shock transformation and revelation. They are made as if their audiences actually care about vampires and werewolves not the dark corners of the human psyche they represent.""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is no exception. Its the first film adaptation from Cassandra Clares series of novels and the fact that there is already at least one sequel planned feels more like a threat than a treat. Directed by Harald Zwart from a screenplay by Jessica Postigo Paquette the story has a lot of ground to cover with a deep albeit nonsensical internal mythos that must be explained quickly. Right up to the last the film is still setting things up.PHOTOS Images from Mortal Instruments City of Bones The movie stars Lily Collins as Clary Fray a young woman who comes across as something of the neoconservative delegate of recent young adult heroines. She complains that she is put into a dress that is too tight and too revealing that her shoes are impractical and all the while she wants to get back to her mother. One of the first things she does upon discovering she has supernatural powers is use them for home renovation and redecorating.Early in the film Clary discovers she is not just a ""mundane"" a plain-old human but rather a part of the world of ""shadowhunters"" a half-human half-angel race that patrols our streets for vampires werewolves and all manner of supernatural creations. Throughout the film Clary discovers -- Jason Bourne-style -- that she possesses powers she never knew she had often at the exact moment she needs them.""City of Bones"" goes so far as to explain how certain sets of musical tones can cause a demon to reveal their true form and that no less than Johann Sebastian Bach was in fact a shadowhunter. In a rather hilarious set of shots the camera looks closely at a portrait of Bach to reveal the faint points of tribal tattoos peeking out from his ruffled 18th century finery. (Brief piano excerpts heard in the film are played by director Zwart.)The film is set in modern-day New York City but there are no real connections to contemporary life as even the cellphone service seems a fantasy working after traveling though some sort of mystical dimensional portal. When a character is introduced as the ""high warlock of Brooklyn"" he does not appear as one might expect as someone with an interest in old-time haberdashery and do-it-yourself pickling techniques. Rather he is the sort of internationalist jet-set glam that has long represented sybaritic impropriety from ""The Hunger"" to ""Blade."" PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013After Clary and her cohorts survive a demon attack the single most dramatic cliffhanger moment of the film occurs when she must decide in an instant whether to hug her longtime nice-guy friend or a bad-boy shadowhunter. The hug happens.Collins has none of the gritty fortitude and self-possession of Kristen Stewart in the ""Twilight"" films or Jennifer Lawrence in ""The Hunger Games"" leaving her as little more than a young woman with extraordinarily luxuriant hair and her rather formidable brow line.Lena Headey a fearsome screen presence who always exudes a regal cant-touch-this-itude such as in her role on ""Game of Thrones"" spends nearly the entire movie either offscreen or inert in some sort of frozen state. Though her character apparently has an expanded role in the future stories here shes wasted and a constant reminder of how wimpy the play-acting kids all seem. Jared Harris and Jonathan Rhys Meyers likewise float through without much to do while CCH Pounder provides unintentional comic relief when a tentacle emerges from her neck.""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is just a sloppy rag bag of ideas cobbled from other stories. Its Bella and Edward until its Luke and Leia and then maybe its not. By then audiences may have just thrown up their hands anyway as the films reaches a noisy cluttered climax that seems to wrap up nothing and simply turns the page to the next story. Chaste and passionless the pre-fab franchise of ""City of Bones"" has crumbled long before it gets there.mark.olsenlatimes.com------------------------------The Mortal Instruments City of BonesMPAA ratings PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action and some suggestive contentRunning time 2 hoursPlaying In wide release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Literature Fiction The Mortal Instruments City of Bones (movie) Arts and Culture Harald Zwart Exclusive Mortal Instruments game lets players be Shadowhunters Hunger Games Divergent The new wave of strong female-led sci-fi Lily Collins wears Dior on Glamours Next Big Thing cover Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-mortal-instruments-20130821,0,4979484.story",200,themortalinstrumentscityofbones18,themortalinstrumentscityofbones,latimes

"Mortal Instruments City of Bones far from mundane review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMortal Instruments City of Bones far from mundane reviewThe Mortal Instruments City of Bones is a well-made supernatural fantasy thriller that boasts a strong cast and great action scenes. The Mortal Instruments Jamie Campbell Bower and Lily Collins shine a light on probable sequels.  (eOne)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentWed. Aug. 21 2013The Mortal Instruments City of Bones Starring Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Jemima West and Kevin Zegers. Directed by Harald Zwart. 130 minutes. Opens Aug. 21 at major theatres. PGIf you thought New York was one crowded city you dont know the half of it.Because beneath the veneer of the venerable metropolis is a dark underworld of witches werewolves vampires and demons and their sworn enemies the Shadowhunters. Article Continued BelowAnd while the rest of us go about our mundane existence -- ""mundane"" is the term Shadowhunters use to refer to us ordinary mortals -- theres an ""ongoing war that can never be won but must always be fought"" as one character notes. Its a war being fought by sexy young people covered in elaborate tattoos sporting gothy attire and wielding all manner of way-cool weaponry.Its the screen adaptation of the first of The Mortal Instruments books City of Bones by best-selling author Cassandra Clare a film clearly engaged in another epic contest to win the hearts and dollars of the same teen audiences and fantasy buffs who have turned the Twilight vampire series into a 1.4 billion worldwide box-office bonanza.The producers of City of Bones are so sure that this film will score with theatregoers theyve already green-lit production of the second film City of Ashes for late September in Toronto barely a month after City of Bones premiere.Will their confidence be rewarded? Very probably.City of Bones and its sequel (or sequels) will inevitably be compared to the Twilight franchise and will probably come out ahead at least critically.Thats because the plot is richer and more complex and the characters more interesting. And while there is some moony-eyed interaction between our heroine Clary and shadowhunter Jace its not nearly as tiresomely overwrought as the relationship between vampire lovers Bella and Edward of the Twilight Saga.Director Harald Zwart who has flailed away at less distinguished cinema fare as The Karate Kid remake (2010) and Agent Cody Banks (2003) finally has a vehicle that tests his talents.His dark vision of the shadow world beyond the ordinary one is intricately detailed and believable throughout even if much of it is the product of CGI mastery.Theres some great fight sequences and Zwart maintains a pulse-thumping pace from start to finish.The casting is mostly solid with fine support from the actors in minor roles. But the real revelation is how well Lily Collins (daughter of ex-Genesis rocker Phil Collins) inhabits the role of Clary so effectively and commands the screen so effortlessly.Jamie Campbell Bower brings a nice intensity to the role of Jace thanks in part to his rather exotic looks including those startlingly big blue eyes and pallid complexion.Robert Sheenan as Clarys ""mundane"" admirer Simon exhibits a puppy dog innocence and haplessness that endears and Canadian actor Kevin Durand chews up the scenery in his short time on-screen as brutish henchman Pangborn. Some of the CGI -- the representation of the demons particularly -- is more silly than successful and Jonathan Rhys Meyers portrayal of Valentine a pivotal role is a bit of a letdown more screechy than menacing. The script by Jessica Postigo contains tantalizing hints of incest and bi-curiosity and moments of much-needed levity -- the ""no zombies"" line is a LOL zinger -- rescuing the film from taking itself too seriously.Understandably theres a number of loose threads left hanging in the story but that only stokes our curiosity for future adventures.One word that wont be used to describe City of Bones mundane.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"The Mortal Instruments City of Bones 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Mortal Instruments City of Bones 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO The Mortal Instruments City of Bones Bad 2 stars Director Harald Zwart.Cast Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Robert Sheehan.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of fantasy violence and action and some suggestive content. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Aug 20 2013 1228 PM ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is the perfect movie for those who thought the ""Twilight"" series just wasnt quite teenage girly enough. Which is odd because director Harald Zwarts adaptation of Cassandra Clares novel threatens to go somewhere darker and dangerous somewhere kind of cool. And then a boy and a girl kiss in a greenhouse as a vapid romantic ballad swells and the sprinkler system goes off. Swoon. Or yawn. Depends on your tolerance. Or whether youve finished high school. Lily Collins plays Clary who lives with her mom Jocelyn (Lena Headey) in New York just a normal girl so she thinks. She starts drawing strange symbols and at a club one night with her best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) can suddenly see people others cant. When one of them named Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) kills someone and no one else notices its clear something is up. Is it ever. Her mom goes missing after a struggle a dog turns into a demon and Clary is a little better at fending off such creatures than she realized she was. There is a lot Clary doesnt realize about who she is. Turns out that she is not as Jace thinks a ""mundane"" or regular human. Jace is a being called a ""Shadowhunter"" part angel and able to see who on Earth are demons and who are humans. An eternal battle rages between blah blah blah oh look Clary is making moon eyes at Jace again. That doesnt sit well with Simon who is understandably jealous because he does not have supernatural powers that chicks dig. Instead hes kind of a nerdy demon punching bag at least for a while. But he is devoted to helping Clary which goes a long way particularly if youre 12. The Shadowhunters assemble at a mansion that serves as their headquarters in the middle of Manhattan that to mundanes looks dilapidated. There they work out whats really going on A bad guy named Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is looking for a supernatural cup for which he has nefarious plans. He is convinced that Clary knows its wherabouts. Its all rather murky. Zwart and screenwriter Jessica Postigo dont always spell things out clearly which can be OK when a filmmaker is trying to give out information in bits and pieces to build suspense. Here it just seems like misguided story telling. Collins whose biggest role was as Snow White in ""Mirror Mirror"" is often as confused as the script. Shell be moping along about something or other and then crack a snarky joke about riding in a car to a werewolf. (There are vampires too. Any resemblance to ""Twilight"" is probably welcome in terms of bringing in an audience.) And yes theres a love triangle one that gets twisty -- a nod to ""Star Wars"" is just one instance of ""The Mortal Instruments"" paying pretty obvious homage to movies that came before it. The ""Harry Potter"" series is another. But theres so much bouncing around in tone and story that this film never really finds its footing. It flounders around trying to figure out what it should be and never really settles on anything. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Based on the novel by Cassandra Clare it stars Lily Collins as Clary Fray a Brooklyn teen who discovers she is a Shadowhunter by birth. Shadowhunters are a society of half-angel warriors who protect humanity against demons apparently. When Clarys mother disappears sexy fellow Shadowhunter Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) guides her into their secret underworld. Along for the ride is besotted best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan). Let the love triangle commence Its a potent mix for young fans that gets off to an entertaining action-packed start with bursts of knowing humour. But its soon bogged down by an increasingly convoluted plot an overindulgent running time and absurd dialogue (So Bach was a Shadowhunter?). The film is at its best when camping it up in leather rather than taking itself so seriously. Heres hoping the sequel is purposefully sillier - and considerably shorter.

The plot is very generic teen fantasy using elements twilight Harry Potter and Underworld to create a rather unbelievable story. Typecasting Aidan Turner as the head werewolf (having also been a werewolf in Being Human) and featuring Lena Headey (Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles and Game of Thrones) the acting leaves a lot to be desired. The usual teen angst love triangles and hissy fits feature regularly whilst the group of teenage Shadowhunters tackle evil demons as well as a fellow Shadowhunters who has gone rouge due to a lust for power.One to avoid even on a Sunday afternoonHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 6 2013samanthaFeaturedmost amazing movie you will ever seeHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreOct 6 2013samanthaFeaturedmost amazing movie you will ever seeHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-mortal-instruments-city-of-bones,200,themortalinstrumentscityofbones23,themortalinstrumentscityofbones,timeout

This movie adaptation of her first tome City of Bones is faithful to that lineage the filmmakers cutting and pasting from Clares nods to J.K. Rowlings series with all the grace of a first-graders collage. Hogwarts is now ""The Institute"" a demon-hunting school smack-dab in the middle of Manhattan hidden from human eyes on another plane of existence. Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) is the Harry surrogate a ""Shadowhunter"" who casts runes slays demons and is revered by his fellow warriors for always saving the day. Theres a Dumbledore theres a Voldemort theres a magical MacGuffin that our heroes must track down but its a soulless attempt to re-create the Potter magic. Mortal Instruments greatest asset--and its only twist on the formula--is Lily Collins. After nameless motiveless thugs kidnap her mother her character Clary stumbles into the arms of the hunky hero and discovers her own Shadowhunter bloodline. Collins is routinely sidelined by a script loaded with Stargate- Total Recall- and Star Wars-inspired tangents but when the plot simmers down the starlet displays blockbuster-worthy charm and agility. If only the fantasy surrounding her made a lick of sense. Here the Muggle types are known as the ""Mundane."" An apt label for a wanna-be franchise with plenty of sheen and nothing to say.

I think that they let the audicene know to soon that Clary and Jace werent brother and sister The set up witht the scenes and order was also a little dissapointing and i didnt feel as though there was much depth into the charectors and there should have been. But thats just my opinion.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 19 2013leeFeaturedI did not like the lead actress and I dont care how much praise she receives by certain critics she is overrated. She did not embody the spirit of the character from the books her costars are too old for there roles and the screen writer (bleep bleep) the script. The actor playing Jaycees best friend/ foster brother is close to 30 years old and hes playing a 18 year old WHY And the same goes for all of the actors who are supposed to be playing teenagers in the movie Hollywood listen up take a cue from Waterloo Road and start hiring Teenagers to play teenagers in your insipid movies and you might actually find successful franchise.

SIMON is the awkward bespectacled equivalent of Clares take on Harry. Keep in mind the love-triangulation and the sparkly softly-lit characterization inherent in it is far more important than the magic to the intended audience.

Incoherent juvenile and often non-sensical this is a story that has everything youre looking for provided that youre looking for absolutely nothing. But who is to blame? Firstly Im loathe to blame the writing or script here mostly because I refuse to believe ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" was written at all. The mostly likely scenario is that they enlisted 35 10th-grade classes giving them each a few blank pieces of paper to work with along with the basic framework of a scene. ""In this scene the girl likes the boy"" I can see them saying or ""Here there is some action involving swords"". From that point on the plucky tenth-graders were off writing for ten to fifteen minutes on how they could see a movie moment like that playing out. These scenes were then collected and shot in movie form which is why there seems to be no rhyme or reason to anything transpiring onscreen. This potpourri delivery mechanism is what left them with moments where main characters reference a conversation that never happened or foreshadow a moment that never comes. Even the context for the subtitle ""City of Bones"" is handled in the following idiotic manner The two main characters head off on an adventure to recover some lost memories. One character takes the other into a graveyard and then motions with his hands ""This is the City of Bones"". Then some unexplained monk-like beings attempt to help revive the characters forgotten moments. And thats it thats the full accounting of ""The City of Bones"" a plot point so important that they mentioned it once for five seconds and then never brought it up again. Of course the acting could be another target for blame only no one could have pulled off cheesiness on this level with a straight face. This is the sort of movie amazingly that makes you long for a ""Twilight"" marathon so disjointed and poorly executed that the audience was often laughing along with parts that werent even remotely intended to be funny. The plot such as it is Lily Collins as Clary discovers shes able to see things that normal people arent a bit like Haley Joel Osment in ""The Sixth Sense"" only shes seeing demons and Shadowhunters instead of dead people. Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) is himself a Shadowhunter tasked with killing evil demons and hes intrigued by Clary once he realizes her ability. However their introduction is immediately wrong-footed as on her birthday she attempts to get into a dance club is denied and then sees something a human cant which causes a demon to intercede for her thus allowing her access to the club which is where Jace runs into her. But wait arent demons the bad guys and Jace one of the good guys and so why would a demon help Clary out? Never fear as this wont be explained just as what Clary actually is will never be explained. Its alternatively posited that shes a mundane (human) with special powers shes actually a Shadowhunter too that shes the daughter of a traitor Shadowhunter or possibly that she holds the key to everything. Or maybe shes pals with warlocks and werewolves but not vampires? ""Aw heck"" thinks ""Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" ""perhaps if we keep throwing out theories and conflicting origin stories it will escape everyones notice that were not telling any story at all."" A noble goal Alas it is not to be because in the end its deadly apparent that the audience is leaving even less informed than they came in the only thing lodged firmly in their memory being an incest subplot (because sure why not?). Its certainly possible that the popular book also titled ""Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is marvelously written full of depth and genius and its a shame that the movie wasnt able to translate any of that cleverness. Possible yes but credit cant be given for solid source material if none it shows up during the film itself. Other scenes and subplots that defy all hope of making sense in this film include Clarys mother being unconscious and a running gag (though the movie didnt mean for it to be one) about how Clary is trying to ""save"" her though from where or what eludes the movie. Additionally Clarys mom Jocelyn played by ""Game of Thrones"" stalwart Lena Headey has a male companion Luke (Aidan Turner) a character that jumps in and out of the narrative as ""Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" looks around desperately trying to stall for time. All of this feels like a movie youve missed the first 45 minutes of theres no reference points or foundation with which to understand anyones motivations or fears. At times Jace and Clary are falling in love only 90 seconds later to come off as ""whatever"" which very well may be indicative of the high school experience but doesnt provide any clarity whatsoever as to what or even whom were supposed to be rooting for. At other moments it would seem that Clary is the key to the propagation of future Shadowhunters but this tact is largely abandoned midway through the film as well. Speaking of are any of these people in school? What do they do for work? How many demons are there? Why are there demons? What do the vampires witches and werewolves have to do with anything? Why can humans occasionally see Jace but not always? What does the sign Clary keeps fixating on mean? The questions keep piling up with each additional scene though unfortunately ""Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" seems massively content to point at Clary and Jace and say ""Lookit those two are making out"" only to later throw out ""Yeah but what if they are brother and sister?"" Its as clumsy as someone with oil on their hands trying to catch an ice cube. ""Bad"" isnt the word ""terrible"" is much closer to what were talking about here. What of the directing? Harald Zwart handled the recent ""Karate Kid"" which wasnt abysmal though hes also responsible for ""Pink Panther 2"" which was. Based on the intended maturity of the content which I can only surmise was of the tween ""Twilight"" and ""Beautiful Creatures"" variety (both of which are eminently watchable) it may have been that stepping up a level in weight class from age nine to around fourteen proved to be too much for Mr. Zwart. This effort can only be kindly described as ""clunky"" which even without a script underneath the narrative is no feather in a directors cap. If you cant win an audience with story you have to do so with pacing and/or visuals and ""Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" certainly falls flat on its face in those categories as well. Once the writing acting and directing are considered it becomes clear theres no primary villain to blame for ""Mortal Instruments"" - only not so innocent bystanders that took the check for subpar work. Really everyone working in conjunction must have had a hand in the miserableness for no one person could produce something this bland and boring. At over two hours it feels around 18 hours long which doesnt bode particularly well for sequel talk. That said the first 30 minutes or so are tolerable when everything is still a mystery because its also supposed to be the point where youre grasping to find plot footing. Past the hour marker however this turns into an exercise of diminishing returns the only real mystery being why anyone would sit through the whole thing in the first place. SCORE 2.5 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and adored ""Beautiful Creatures"" and ""Twilight New Moon"".

The Mortal Instruments City of Bones (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Mortal Instruments City of Bones (PG-13) Fans of Cassandra Clares young-adult novels will love this film adaptation. Everyone else not so much. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/20/2013 Editor rating 2 Start with a heaping helping of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Throw in some Percy Jackson a dash of Twilight a spoonful of The Vampire Diaries and a sprinkling of Harry Potter and you end up with The Mortal Instruments City of Bones the latest in a seemingly endless series of coming-of-age stories set against a fantasy/horror backdrop. In the 1980s and 90s teenagers usually served only one purpose in scary movies To get slaughtered. Today though they increasingly make their way into young adulthood by vanquishing supernatural evil. I suppose thats progress. This adaptation of Cassandra Clares first book in her popular series of young adult novels is wildly ambitious in scope and looks far better than its relatively modest budget of 60 million. The story focuses on Clary (Lily Collins) a teenager living in Brooklyn with her mother who discovers shes the latest descendant in a line of Shadowhunters half-human half-angel creatures ordained to protect humanity from demons vampires slimy tentacled things and practically every other monster you can think of (except for zombies; in one of the films few traces of wit Clary learns there is no such thing). The creatures live among us invisible to ordinary mortals and are kept in check by the Shadowhunters attractive tattooed teens who wear lots of black leather the angel-faced Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) who is supposed to be a fearsome warrior but is so pale and skinny you keep wanting to give him something to eat; the surly Alec (Kevin Zegers) who resents Clarys presence for reasons that are totally not what you think; and the intrepid Isabelle (Jemima West) who is defined primarily by her mean magical whip. Instead of frontloading City of Bones with one of those expositional voice-overs that explains the movies universe to the audience director Harold Zwart (The Karate Kid remake) and screenwriter Jessica Postigo allow us to gradually discover it through Clarys eyes. There are neat little touches such as the revelation that Johann Bach was a Shadowhunter who composed a piece of music that compels any demon that hears it to shed its human disguise. There are some genuinely creepy set pieces such as a visit to a run-down hotel inhabited entirely by vampires and an encounter with a kindly witch (The Shields CCH Pounder) that takes a sudden and scary turn. City of Bones contains the requisite love triangle this one involving Jace Clary and her sweet-natured pal Simon (Robert Sheehan) who doesnt even try to hide his longstanding crush on her (she thinks of him as a brother). Although it is aimed squarely at teens the movie has a refreshingly laidback attitude toward sexuality When the heroes visit a powerful warlock named Magnus (Godfrey Gao) he greets them in his underwear and immediately starts macking on Alec. There are moments of surprisingly effective horror (including a snarling Rottweiler that turns out to be something far more menacing). Lena Headey as Clarys mother gets to throw down against two baddies in a scene that makes her character Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones seem like a frail dandelion. But Clares almost 500-page book was dense in history and mythology. Even well into its second hour City of Bones is still having to explain who the evil Valentine (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) is or why Hodge (Jared Harris) who is to the Shadowhunters what Rupert Giles was to Buffy is unable to step outdoors. And I havent even mentioned the werewolves. Or the portal into another dimension. Or a whole bunch of other stuff. Near the big finale as the movie furiously cuts back and forth between a swordfight flamethrowers razor-sharp boomerangs dungeons demons made of glowing red ash and swarms of evil birds I completely lost track of what was going on in this nutty overstuffed picture. But I cant say I was bored either. Only the ending which leaves about five different plotlines dangling a la the carbonite Han Solo in The Empire Strikes Back was truly irritating. Plans for the second film are already underway with a targeted release date of 2014 (with Sigourney Weaver joining the cast). But unlike the Harry Potter series which managed to cross over far beyond the books readers The Mortal Instruments franchise is strictly for the initiated. They will no doubt love it. Everyone else will be flummoxed. Cast Lily Collins Jamie Campbell Bower Kevin Zegers Jemima West Robert Sheehan Godfrey Gao Jonathan Rhys Meyers Lena Headey Jared Harris CCH Pounder Aidan Turner.

You would be wrong. Stop me if youve heard this one Photogenic teen discovers shes part of a long line of special people with super-human powers and shes now the target of a supremely evil figure from her past who wants to use her as part of his plot to destroy humanity. Meanwhile shes torn between two handsome boys (one blond one brunet) who are obsessed with her. Take a big scoop of ""Harry Potter"" legacy-of-magic add a dollop of ""Twilight"" chaste romance and then sprinkle in a little ""Star Wars"" whos-your-daddy-drama for good measure and the unpalatable result is ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" a thoroughly dreary and occasionally baffling YA-by-the-numbers saga. And to make matters worse while well never get to see the follow-ups to ""The Golden Compass"" or ""Beautiful Creatures"" the second ""Mortal Instruments"" movie is already on its way from the same writer (Jessica Postigo) and director (Harald Zwart ""Pink Panther 2"" the 2010 ""The Karate Kid"") that made this one such a chore to endure. Also read Box Office Mortal Instruments Not Likely to Stop the Bleeding for Twilight Wannabes Adapting the first in a series of novels by Cassandra Clare Postigo and Zwart throw in everything from witches and vampires and demons to gay warlocks mini-skirted monster hunters and werewolf bikers but this silly epic never goes anywhere remotely interesting. Clary (Lily Collins ""Mirror Mirror"") is hitting her late adolescence and compulsively drawing the same symbol over and over again; when she spots the image in a nightclub sign (that seemingly no one else can see) shes given the nod to enter the most PG-13 Samp;M disco on earth where she sees snake jewelry come to life and a club kid get run through with a sword. While Clarys out the next day with nerdy pal Simon (Robert Sheehan the ""Red Riding"" trilogy) two supernaturally-powered goons attack Clarys mother Jocelyn (Lena Headey) and demand that she hand over a magical cup. With the help of Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) the swordman from the nightclub Clary fends off a Rottweiler-turned-hellbeast awaiting her at the apartment. Jace tells Clary that he and Jocelyn are both Shadowhunters supposedly half-human and half-angel beings who defend humanity from demons. As Clary tries to remember her past she finds herself torn between her tender feelings for Simon and her new attraction to Jace all of which gets complicated by the appearance of the deadly Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) who has a longstanding connection to any number of the characters here. See video The Mortal Instruments City of Bones Teases Every Monster You Can Imagine (Rhys Meyers does provide a highlight of sorts by hamming it up so much during a scene involving a signet ring that he momentarily sends the films camp factor off the charts. If the rest of the movie provided as many unintentional laughs wed be talking a must-see here.) ""City of Bones"" by no means lacks incident what with all the people drawing sacred runes and tracking down objects and breaking into churches to find vampire-hunting weapons and opening gateways within dimensions but none of it registers. The years umpteenth origin story filtered through some of the most familiar tropes of contemporary pop literature turns out to be one of the summers biggest snoozes. Theres no reckless fun here nor even the kind of exaggerated self-seriousness that made the ""Twilight"" movies entertaining viewing for fans and snickerers alike. ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" feels like a pilot for a Teen Nick series you wouldnt want to watch. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" hopes to be the start of a new franchise for tweens and Twihards but the twuth is this twash is anything but a twiumph. Maybe the author who uncorked the popular book series shouldnt twi so hard (starting with her pen name ""Cassandra Clare."" Actually shes Judith Rumelt.) Rumelt has overstuffed this thing to the groaning point (or maybe I was the one groaning) with so many vampires demons werewolves runes crypts warriors weapons and witches that its as if someone handed her a checklist of stuff that sells young adult fantasy fiction and she couldnt leave anything out. Lily Collins plays Clary the Harry Potter-like girl growing up in Brooklyn without a dad though given that its Collins I guess youd call her Hairy Eyebrows. Shes unaware that shes not one of us human ""mundanes"" (geez Judith when you ripped off ""muggles"" you couldnt find a word a little less similar?) but a magical Shadowhunter like the hunky blond guy (pouty lips pouty cheekbones even pouty hair) named Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) whom she meets after he runs his sword through someone at a nightclub. Jonathon Rhys Meyers dreadlock mullet is the most terrifying aspect of this overstuffed film. (AP) In the first of 75 consecutive expository scenes explaining how we all got here thousand-year-old Jace tells her about his friends who wear neck and shoulder tats called runes and their war with the cult of shapeshifting demons which attacked her mother in search of an unholy grail that chief villain Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers in a dreadlocks mullet that is the only frightening thing in the movie) wants for evil purposes that are still being explained in the closing minutes of the movie. We move on to more back story from a gay guy named Magnus (Godfrey Gao) at a sort of vampire pub who explains hes been hypnotizing Clary for years so as to repress her memories about who she really is. Jared Harris Jaces Shadowhunter Scoutmaster checks in to deliver more back story and somewhere along the line local magical black person Dorothea (CCH Pounder) a Brooklyn witch reads the tarot cards that reveal Clary has a deep connection with cups. The front story such as it is brings battles that arent remotely suspenseful or involving such as a big silly fight with a gang of pose-y vampires. As for the inevitable hookup between the leads its momentarily delayed by a dumb lovers quarrel The godlike Jace actually gets jealous when he spots her platonic best friend Simon (Robert Sheehan) waiting for her in her room at Shadowhunter H.Q. but Simon practically has ""nerd sidekick"" written on his forehead. No one over the age of 14 could possibly see him as a rival and Jace is 986 years over the age of 14. I think my favorite moment came when Clary having been stuffed into a lacy little black number and thigh-highs that 1985 Madonna would have deemed too slutty stops to ask ""How is dressing like a hooker going to bring my mother back?"" Clary you are not a person. You are a list of 13-year-old girl faves secrets feeling underestimated tall blond guys in low-slung leather trousers tats birthdays (Clary is having one when everything starts to happen) and the bimbo Goth look. Or maybe my favorite bit was the page of dialogue virtually lifted from ""The Empire Strikes Back."" Or maybe it was when we learn Bach designed chords to annoy demons because he was a Shadowhunter himself. (Cut to portrait of Johann Sebastian wearing those neck and sleeve tats you probably didnt notice before). One of the good guys plays some Bach to draw out a demon then is completely unprepared when the monster emerges. In the end there are so many special effects -- to no particular effect and with none feeling special -- that I could barely catalogue what was going on. Lets see draw this sword away from this evil pentagram which will close the skylight that sent a beam of light over Manhattan which will calm the evil bats but...anyway the main action is in the other room and there are these friendly werewolves who have promised not to turn wolfy but kinda do anyway and theyre up against these alien monsters who look like theyre made of ash and apparently freeze if you flash the right rune at them but we dont know that until after it happens which just seems random. ""I understand what you did and I forgive you"" goes one of the closing lines of dialogue. Well I dont and I dont.

For every multi-film Harry Potter phenomenon theres a handful of Golden Compasses or Eragons indicating that the target demo adolescents are savvy consumers. They know that the best of these series construct deeply felt mythologies around characters fans feel like they could somehow be. The first adaptation of Cassandra Clares The Mortal Instruments novels City of Bones does neither playing onscreen as an endless parade of derivative genre tropes even tedious and convoluted when it dares to break the formula--there may or may not be an incest subplot. Lily Collins headlines as Clary Fray a teenager who quickly discovers that she and her mother Jocelyn (Lena Headey) are shadowhunters those of angelic blood who hunt demons. Jace Wayland (Jamie Campbell Bower) another shadowhunter comes to her rescue when Clary discovers that her mother is missing. Simon (Robert Sheehan) Clarys best friend is a mundane a person unable to see these magical realms. Together the trio begins the usual epic adventure of good vs. evil in which ancient worlds collide and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Jared Harris engage in swordplay. The nomenclature varies slightly but theres little new or exciting in City of Bones. For strong female role models and unique fantasy settings stick with The Hunger Games. The adaptation of the second book has already been announced but the series already seems as if it has outlived its mortality.Subscribe to the Voice Film Club podcastFollow VoiceFilmClubFilm Details The Mortal Instruments City of Bones RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time120 More Info Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact John Oursler Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune August 23 2013 -- 938am Video (2346)  ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" is the first movie in a proposed franchise about angels and demons (and vampires and werewolves and celestial hit men called shadowhunters) in contemporary New York City. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Have we coddled the current crop of kids to the point where they only recognize reflections of themselves in superhero movies? Or is modern life so daunting that they seek escape in stories where they can defeat armies of enemies and stay young forever? The latest expression of this youthful ardor for paranormal tales is ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones"" the first movie in a proposed franchise about angels and demons (and vampires and werewolves and celestial hit men called shadowhunters) in contemporary New York City. Jamie Campbell Bower (a graduate of the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" movies) stars as a pre-Raphaelite heartthrob named Jace who looks as fresh as morning though hes been battling Earths demon trespassers for more than a thousand years. Luckily for him the Gothic look of his youth is in fashion again and he blends into the club landscape. Lily Collins plays regular gal Clary whose doodles of a rune-like symbol suggest that shes unknowingly connected with Jaces battle clan of hot pouty angel/human halfbreeds. The film works better than it might have thanks to well-conceived characters and agile direction by Harald Zwart (2010s ""The Karate Kid""). When otherworldly bad guys break into the Brooklyn apartment of Clarys artist mother in search of an enchanted chalice Jace comes to Clarys rescue. An attraction is instantaneous. Shes pretty; he with his bedroom eyes preposterous cheekbones and luxuriant hair is prettier. They share missing-father issues which has made him rude and sarcastic while she has a thing for strong protective older (much much older) men. Even running for their lives the duo show a gift for creating characters who can needle each other and bicker while zig-zagging toward a close-up kiss. The movie has a zippy energy that makes it easy to slide over half-baked plot points but the puzzlers keep piling up. By the messy confused finale I felt like I was watching a Scientology PowerPoint presentation. Screen Gems Jace (Jamie Campbell Bower) and Clary (Lily Collins) play an attractive duo engaged in a divine battle against demon trespassers in ""The Mortal Instruments City of Bones."" Why would the storys immortal villain Valentine (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) employ a pair of (apparently) human henchmen to do his dirty work? How can a mortal get a vampire bite but not become a vampire? When Valentine discloses a secret about Clary and Jaces parentage is he a reliable witness? Above all where is everyone in New York City? Other than a crowded disco scene the Big Apple seems to have a population of about 11. Perhaps they scrimped on extras to splurge on visual effects. The film has a look with dark grandiose interiors cobwebby catacombs and several varieties of demons. I especially enjoyed the humanoids made out of ash and embers and the attack dogs composed of Silly Putty. With its spectacle morbid sense of humor and hustling pace ""The Mortal Instruments"" encourages you to shrug and just go with it.
