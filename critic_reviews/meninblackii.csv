Given that Tommy Lee Joness deadpan Agent K has shriveled to the point where hes now merely prunish it was a fine idea to invent a plot in which Will Smiths Agent J hurtles back in time to save the life of his mentor and a better one to cast another actor. As the younger K Josh Brolin wears a semi-squashed nose (it is age-appropriately less spread) slits his eyes and replicates the music in Joness voice  that weary quarter-tone-up-the-scale Southern sigh that makes good comebacks bluesy. Theyve cast a still-untapped major talent  Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords  as the snarling extraterrestrial villain Boris the Animal and concocted a fascinating character in Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) a disheveled entity hidden under multiple layers of clothes and driven mad by his ability (more curse than gift) to see multiple futures at once. Such agreeable personalities as Emma Thompson (as the new boss) the dishy Brit Alice Eve (as the younger Thompson) and Bill Hader (as Andy Warhol) flit in and out. The finished product is in a different league than the whompingly terrible Men in Black II  it hits its marks. But its not inventive enough to overcome the overarching inertia the palpable absence of passion. Barry Sonnenfeld is a puzzling director  so smart so worldly so plugged into the community of hipsters (he got his start as a cinematographer for Joel and Ethan Coen) and so square. For some reason he loves putting his subjects dead center in the frame  doorknob-dead. A setting that cries out for bustle and throwaway gags gets served up on a slab. The only casual thing is his handling of the violence  darts in peoples brains  which is more graphic than it needs to be and doesnt gibe with the jokey tone. Bystanders are just fodder. The script was enough of a mess to stop the shooting for high-priced rewrites but you know what they say about washing garbage. Better lines would have helped Smith who delivers rat-a-tat arias of desperation and long ironic monologues to onlookers whove seen too much and whose memories hes about to zap  by my (imprecise) count one out of ten jokes gets a solid laugh. Clement has a roaring entrance in the wittily storyboarded prison-break overture spitting his invectives through his Jagger lips and a mouthful of giant rotted incisors; and hes funny when he goes back to the late sixties and meets his younger biker self and all they can do is bellow at each other. But hes stuck spewing the same second-rate comebacks (Agree to disagree Dont call me the Animal) and he grows tiresome. At least Haders Warhol  surrounded by Factory creatures far stranger than the sundry aliens  has nice moments and Stuhlbargs Griffin is an original. Instead of going for a manic Robin Williamslike spritz Griffin relays visions of possible timelines (each branching into entirely different futures) with a kind of beatific resignation having long abandoned the idea of holding it all together. As usual in the Men in Black pictures there are amusingly outlandish alien effects the head that whines while being used as a bowling ball; the dart-spitting scorpionlike creature that inserts itself into Boriss hand with puppyish affection. Bo Welchs design of J and Ks headquarters continues to take your breath away the sleek white-on-white interiors looking as if theyve been fashioned from some hard plastic substance unknown by the rest of Earth beautifully setting off the agents skinny black suits and ties. You can imagine the sinking feeling of Sonnenfeld Smith and company standing around those stunning sets and thinking Why is this script not working? A better question would have been Where is the love? -- David Edelstein Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick HBOas Divorce Is Actually a Wish Fulfillment Comedy HBOas Limited Series The Night Of Might Get a Second Season Game of Thrones Will Officially End With Season 8 TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

Sony Pictures The world is generally not kind to long-belated sequels. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that long-belated sequels are generally not kind to the world. When a film property sits on the shelf long enough its recipe fades and its ingredients molder. Thus The Godfather Part III. Thus The Two Jakes. Thus Indiana Jones and the Aliens George Lucas Insisted On Putting In. (Yes yes Toy Story 3 you get to be the rule-proving exception.) Men in Black III seemed poised to add to this litany of cinematic woe ambling along a decade after the franchises already weary second installment slouched into theaters. Yet contrary to expectation the movie represents at least a partial return to form--not as inventive as the first but surely better than the recycled materials that made up the second. Its hardly a must-see or even a should-see. But its a might-see a could-if-youre-in-the-mood-see. The movie stars Will Smith as Agent J Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K and in its defining flourish Josh Brolin as Tommy Lee Jones. (Back to this in a moment.) As the story opens Agents J and K are fulfilling their professional obligation to ensure that the many extraterrestrials living covertly on Earth obey the laws delineating their visits. (In particular theres one proprietor of a Chinese restaurant whose Noodle Surprise contains a larger than usual surprise...) But from the start something is weighing Agent K down even beyond his appropriate guilt over MiB II. Hes surlier and less communicative than in the earlier films swimming against an undertow of hidden sorrow. ""What is the most destructive force in the universe?"" he asks J before answering himself ""Regret."" Whats going on? Have we stumbled into No Country for Old Men in Black? The movie takes its time in providing an answer but early on we learn that Ks regrets are somehow connected to an alien assassin he apprehended at Cape Canaveral in July 1969 (students of astronautical history take note). Moreover that very assassin Boris the Animal--played by Jemaine Clement with the kind of swaggering relish scarcely seen since Tim Curry took off his garters--has after decades of incarceration just escaped from his prison on the Moon. MORE ON MOVIES The Deathly Dullness of Dark Shadows Our Picks for Which Film to See Each Week of Summer The Astonishing Avengers How to Fix the Action Movie Boris arrives in New York and shortly thereafter Agent K vanishes. Searching for him at Men in Black HQ (essentially IKEA but with a better-dressed clientele) Agent J is told that K has been dead for over 40 years. Boris has of course gone back in time to 1969 and altered history by killing Agent K; it falls to J of course to follow him and alter it back. The central gag of the movie and its a good one is that Agent K circa 1969 is played by Josh Brolin who captures Joness inflections with unerring fidelity. Brolin has gifts both for mimicry and for the particular rhythms of Texas and as he did in W. he puts both to good use here. Like Jones his delivery is at once clipped and drawn out martial and laconic. Brolin puts more care into uttering a single syllable-and-a-half Alright than many actors devote to entire performances. Smith is good if hardly memorable as J and Jones makes the most of his limited screen time as Agent K circa 2012. Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man) does a nice job as a potentially cloying alien ally though Emma Thompson is underutilized as new MiB chief Agent O. The movie gets appropriate mileage out of its 1969 milieu without going the full Austin Powers and has a nice reversal on the obvious Andy-Warhol-must-be-an-alien joke. There are gags about using cell phones on airplanes flushing goldfish down toilets and the improbability of the Miracle Mets pennant drive. And while the film hardly represents a return to early form for director Barry Sonnenfeld its nice to see him working on the big screen again. In the end though MiB III is somewhat undone by its own structure. Having opened with the proposition that what happens in 1969 will explain the personal loss nursed by Agent K ever since the film faces a quandary It can close with a truly terrible event thus messing with the whole goofy MiB vibe; or it can make light of it thus undermining its own premise. For me the conclusion missed in both directions at once--offering a revelation with serious implications but then uncomfortably ushering it offstage as quickly as possible. Its a pity theres no going back to fix it.

Twitter previousTrack of the Day ObligatednextFirst Black Graduate of Naval Academy Dies Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 65 Id Like to Hear His Wife Say Something James Fallows None The most personally moving and most fundamentally patriotic moment of the Democratic National Convention was the appearance by the bereaved parents of Army Captain Humayun Khan and the statement about the meaning of their sons life and death and about the Constitution by Mr. Khizr Khan. After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

At area theaters in 2-D and 3-D. Its been a decade since Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones appeared on screen as comedic partners but now alien-control Agent J and Agent K are back in ""Men in Black 3."" Fittingly given the franchises space-time theories of time and dimension this outing hinges on time travel. When the taciturn senior agent K (Jones) vanishes in a profoundly existential way J goes back to 1969 to thwart the designs of Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) and save his future partner -- and the planet. Josh Brolins turn as a younger K is a clever well-played pleasure (and deliciously peculiar since Brolin and Jones were in ""No Country for Old Men""). Its been a few years too since Smith -- not so long ago a staple of summertime fare -- had a berth in the season of the presumptive tentpole blockbuster. Hes been plying his trade in more serious fare as actor-producer (""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""Seven Pounds"") as well as producer (""The Secret Life of Bees"" and ""Lakeview Terrace"") with laudable if mixed results. The Smith-Jones duos return as the titularly clad operatives while not exactly essential comes with the charms of reprised well-liked characters and a ""didnt-see-that-coming"" conclusion that makes up for the first hours sequelitis. Its easy to forget mid-kvetch that sequels are popular in large part because they reunite us with familiar characters we took to in the first place. Here the familiar is the story. ""Men in Black 3"" is about J and K their odd-couple energy their abiding fondness Js interest in what makes K tick ever so imperceptibly. With the exception of Emma Thompsons martini-dry timing the beginning is pro forma. Maybe thats part of the point J and K have nested into their banter their mind-erasing of bystanders who have witnessed aliens their routine. A spat of sorts finds the pair on the phone which makes it possible to crack the door open on their personalities. K wears a perpetual hangdog glower. J has an big portrait of a dog hanging on his wall. Ks home is a surprisingly warmer affair a masculine library. Js is a sleek minimalist abode with an outsized screen just off camera for video games. The goofy aliens and mandated (but hardly awesome) 3-D are for easy laughs yuks and a couple of ""awws"" (a spiky little thing in a Chinatown restaurant is especially cute). A scene in a bowling alley finds a wise guy mouthing off and gesticulating part Jersey part a galaxy far far away. Written by Etan Cohen (""Tropic Thunder"") and starring an actor angling to portray the nations first black prez ""Men in Black 3"" teases ideas of race and racism. ""1969 wasnt the best time for your people"" says slacker/time-jumping facilitator Jeffrey Price (a pleasingly lax Michael Chernus) right before J leaps off the Chrysler Building into the vortex of the roiling decade. An earlier scene in a Chinese restaurant likewise swings on the a performer being in on -- heck exploiting -- the joke. Js warned more than once ""Dont ask questions you dont want to know the answer to."" Still hes right to wonder given what hes learned of the cosmos in his years of service. What questions has he to fear? Contrary to the evidence its hard to believe the filmmakers -- or Clement -- intended to make villain Boris an example of the banality of evil. Though hes got a bizarrely mirthless laugh and his teeth are a jagged mess hes dull. In the spirit of happy dej... vu theres Griffin an alien that recalls a former Boulder resident alien one Mork from Ork. Michael Stuhlbarg (""Boardwalk Empire"" ""A Serious Man"") has Robin Williams squinty impish smile. Once he arrives on screen ""Men in Black"" finds itself in bemusing touching and smarter territory. Brolin is terrific capturing the tight-lipped cowboy poetry of Jones Agent K as a quasi-cowpoke in a suit. But its not mere imitation. After all something did indeed happen to K to make him the grim mentor J knows him as. What that was turns out to be one of the finer kernels offered in an airy popcorn flick.

Starring Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin Director Barry Sonnenfeld Release Opened May 25 2012  Editorial Review Peace love and aliens in the 1960s By Michael OSullivanFriday May 25 2012First the good news. There are a couple of real pleasures in ""Men in Black III"" the third installment of the sci-fi adventure-comedy series about cops policing a shadow world of aliens living among us. The most satisfying is the setup itself. In a time-travel scenario Agent J (Will Smith) must go back to 1969 to prevent the murder of his partner Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) by another interloper in the space-time continuum an escaped convict named Boris the Animal who was once locked up by Agent K. Boris is played by an unrecognizable Jemaine Clement (""The Flight of the Conchords"") and a pile of CGI effects. Agent Ks younger self is played by Josh Brolin who uses some old-fashioned acting to create an uncanny -- and pretty funny -- personification of Joness laconic squinty-eyed K. Brolins performance is another of the films delights. But the best thing about the setup -- which conveniently coincides with the Apollo 11 moon launch a key plot point -- is that it affords the film an opportunity to make fun of the 60s which it does most nimbly in a scene set at Andy Warhols Factory. Bill Haders Warhol who hides a secret that I wont reveal can be added to the growing list of worthy cinematic impersonations of the iconic silver-wigged artist. Michael Stuhlbarg (""A Serious Man"") also makes a good impression as Griffin the Archanan a harmless alien with the ability to perceive many potential futures simultaneously. Half neurotic mess half blase hippie hes like Woody Allen crossed with Pauly Shore. Miraculously that somehow works. Not everything in the film does. Until Agent J ""time jumps"" into the past -- a trick that entails him leaping off the Chrysler Building -- the movie feels flat-footed and lazy reprising old jokes and sight gags from the two earlier films. It simply takes too long for things to get going. And Agent Js plunge (repeated late in the film from the top of rocket scaffolding at Cape Canaveral) looks way too obviously like a green-screen effect. All of the special effects budget seems to have gone into Boris who has some kind of deadly scorpion critter living in a hole in the palm of his hand. Its actually kind of cool but enough already. An early Chinese restaurant scene features a fishy little alien that looks like a 10 rubber hand puppet someone picked up from the toy store. Adding to the list of misfires is Emma Thompson as Agent O who replaces Rip Torn as the head of the M.I.B. agency. Seemingly intended to add spice as Agent Ks is-she-or-isnt-she love interest the actress is hopelessly wasted. One wonders whether the character wasnt introduced simply to justify a ""Men in Black IV."" Agent O goes nowhere. Finally theres the tone. In earlier incarnations the ""Men in Black"" franchise struck a happy balance between sly humor and slimy alien action. This third outing climaxes with a dark and melodramatic twist that while adding a layer of nuance and back story that the previous two films never had also feels wildly out of sync with its audiences expectations. If there ever is a ""Men in Black IV"" -- and at this point its hard to imagine one -- lets hope it finds that delicate balance between the yuks and the yucks.Contains sci-fi action violence and some suggestive material.

He channels Jones mannerisms nails his Texan drawl and even rather eerily resembles the actor approximating the signature steely glance that seems to reach right through people. With his low-key delivery its not hard to imagine that this more amiable fellow could grow into the surly and enigmatic secret agent played by Jones.Other supporting parts are memorably quirky in particular arch-villain Boris the Animal played with a zestful Tim Curry quality by Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement and A Serious Mans Michael Stuhlbarg as a nebbishy knowing alien named Griffin.VIDEO Men in Black 3 London premiereMORE Smith Brolin discuss working together on MiB3A top-secret corps of agents who monitor alien activity -- working in collaboration with extraterrestrial good guys and fending off the nefarious ones -- is a clever conceit as presented in the original film a decade and a half ago.This spirited three-quel comes close to the exuberance of the first Men in Black and is a distinct improvement over its limp 2002 follow-up. By filling in the blanks of the back stories of both Agents J (Smith) and K (Jones) it opens up a new era -- the late 60s -- which provides plenty of fodder for alien jokes and comedy. It also adds an unexpectedly poignant element to the saga.About the movieMen in Black 3 out of fourStars Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin Emma Thompson Jemaine Clement Michael Stuhlbarg Alice Eve Director Barry SonnenfeldDistributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and brief suggestive content Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens Friday nationwideAgent J goes back in time when his tight-lipped partners life is put in jeopardy by the nasty Boris a space prison escapee.

Media San Francisco Chronicle MIB3 Science fiction-action. Starring Will Smith Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. (PG-13. 106 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""MIB3"" is not quite as fresh as 1997s ""Men in Black."" But its a heck of a lot better than 2002s ""Men in Black II"" which failed to replicate its predecessors hipness humor and sticky alien charm. All three elements are in place for ""MIB3"" once again directed by Barry Sonnenfeld who returns to the freaks-among-us alterniverse where a secret arm of government monitors the comings and goings of extraterrestrials just trying to make a buck - or launch an intergalactic invasion - from grubby storefronts in and around New York. New this time are converted 3-D visuals which run from unobtrusive to outright razzle-dazzle A leap off the Chrysler Building offers the best single hunk of eye candy in the franchise so far. Also new is a time-travel plot in which K the cranky agent in the Roy Orbison getup is played by not one but two scowling actors four decades apart. The first as ever is Tommy Lee Jones; the second is Josh Brolin who eerily duplicates Jones voice glower physicality and overall sense of unresolved gastric distress. Hes a nice foil for the ageless and chipper Will Smith returning as Ks non-cranky partner J who hoofs it back to 1969 after a time-jumping Boglodite with projectile hand fangs (Jemaine Clement) whacks the younger K before K has a chance to shoot off his arm.

Good. Because this completely screws up the space-time continuum. K as we know from the previous two films was already instrumental in saving the world on multiple occasions and here we learn of his role in yet another. The screenplay by ""Tropic Thunder"" co-scribe Etan Cohen obeys the usual sci-fi conventions with economy and tidy narrative reasoning though its best not to think too hard about the nitty-gritty of temporal displacement. Abundant humor dabs of heartbreak and a suspenseful vertiginous climax go a long way toward compensating for any logical lapses or cliches. Another big plus Michael Stuhlbarg (""A Serious Man"") as a cosmic interloper in a fuzzy hat who captures the multifold emotional delicacies of fifth-dimensional existence with wide-eyed sweetness and depth. As for the 44-year-old Brolin hes a bit long in the tooth for the 29-year-old K. But this is after all a movie with (a) a guy who shoots teeth from his palm and (b) a scene in which Emma Thompson monologues in Venusian. If youre looking for cinema verite look elsewhere. If youre looking for a fun fizzy sequel in a franchise left for dead 10 years ago have at it. Amy Biancolli is a Hearst movie writer.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Men in Black 3 Video Rated PG-13  103 minutes  2012 The comedy sci-fi franchise returns after a ten-year hiatus with the same formula of respectably funny wisecracks and obsessively detailed space monsters. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as secret agents who monitor extraterrestrial visitors to earth though Jones gets relatively little screen time; the story has Smith traveling to the year 1969 to prevent his partner (played as a younger man by Josh Brolin) from being zapped by an escaped convict (with clusters of little fingers knitting together around his eye sockets in the palms of his hands etc). As in most successful fantasy blockbusters theres a comfortable balance between technological wizardry and human talent--for all the eye-popping special effects one of the chief pleasures here is Brolins impeccable mimicry of Joness weary West Texas drawl.

"Movie review Men in Black 3 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview A far out trip to the past in Men in Black 3In the new installment of the space-alien policing series Will Smith and Josh Brolin (as a younger Tommy Lee Jones) are chasing a bad alien in 1969 and the new mission makes for a campy fun film.May 25 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Will Smith stars in ""Men in Black 3."" (Wilson Webb / Columbia Pictures )""Men in Black 3"" has got the MIB mojo back a well most of it anyway. With Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones once again suited up and sporting shades as agents J and K and a casting coup in Josh Brolin playing Ks younger self the latest alien crisis is good trippy fun as the fate of Earth and 60s retro style hang in the balance.Director Barry Sonnenfeld whos been onboard from the first film has recovered some of the brashness and all of the unbridled affection for the weird wonky otherworldly types that made the initial 1997 cosmic comedy such a kick. ""3"" is a more restrained affair but it kind of suits the guys now that an entire decade has passed since the disappointing ""Men in Black II."" Lets just let that poor sap rest in peace.In a sense thats the films opening gambit a a funeral for one of the agencys own that essentially represents the passing of an era with K (Jones) delivering the driest eulogy in memory. But ""MIB 3"" is not content to leave the past alone and neither is a very crusty alien called Boris the Animal (""Flight of the Conchords"" Jemaine Clement is proving once again how well crazy suits him). He is 40 years into a life sentence for some very bad behavior but determined to find a way to get back to the 60s so he can reclaim well a little piece of his former self.Whatever Boris has in mind all that Agent J (Smith) knows (or anyone whos seen the trailers) is that one day he and K are crime-fighting partners 20-plus years into cleaning up alien messes and using that handy neuralyzer to remove any ordinary humans memory of those events a and the next day he wakes up to a world where K has been dead for decades. And therein lies the meat and potatoes of ""MIB3.""Can history be rewritten and K be saved? Is time travel possible? Will J take a leap of faith or at least one off the top of the Chrysler Building to find out? Its certainly a good excuse to let J do a little time traveling and test whether hell have as much on-screen chemistry with Brolins K as Jones. As a footnote Emma Thompson has joined the task force as O theoretically the agent running the entire secret agent shebang (Alice Eve plays her younger self). But as it has been from the first this is a boys game and the women barely register.No surprise there is a lot more than Ks fate riding on Agent Js mission and with both a present day and a 60s-era version of Boris on the loose there are so many new memories to be made a and erased. That back-to-the-future element proves to be ""MIB3s"" best feature if for no other reason than it allows Brolin to have a go at channelingJones which he does brilliantly. The locked-down partner that J has lived with all these years turns out to be a lot looser guy in 1969. There is even the hint of a love life. One of the movies great pleasures is watching all the ways in which Jones Agent K temperamental and totally impatient informs but doesnt define Brolins version of the character.Fortunately there are other reasons that the past is a blast thanks to ""3s"" screenwriter Etan Cohen a ""Beavis and Butthead"" alum and a co-writer of the dark farce ""Tropic Thunder."" Cohen likes messing around with convention and he does a nifty job letting a vintage vibe overtake most of the movie with director of photography Bill Pope (""Matrix"") production designer Bo Welch (all ""MIBs"" and much more) Oscar-winning visual effects whizzes Ken Ralston and Jay Redd and master creature creator Rick Baker more than happy to find themselves in a kind of retro heaven.As it happens 1969 was a very busy year with space travel sports hippies and more providing the filmmakers a lot of fodder to futz with. The main conduit for keeping this fairly complicated story straight comes in the form of Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg). The actor who was excellent as the much-tested martyr at the center of the Coen brothers""A Serious Man"" is completely captivating here as a sweet alien nebbish whose special effect is his multi-platform memory a basically he knows all the possible scenarios for what happens next depending on what happens now.Smith has always been the glue that held MIB together and he does so again in ""3."" Heres the difficulty. The very winning wide-eyed wise-cracking rookie Smith introduced in the original ""MIB"" made for a hard act to follow even for the actor. Both he and the movie get some of the swagger back here. But for fans the exhilaration of experiencing the originals inventiveness for the very first time a well that ship has sailed. Still 1969 turns out to be a pretty good year for the men in black making ""3"" campy fun if not quite a classic.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMen fights well but misses a predictionMay 28 2012Box office Men in Black 3 tops Avengers with...May 28 2012Men in Black 3 was no easy sequel to makeMay 14 2012In this years cast ...January 14 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesSuitsEntertainmentTime TravelCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-men-in-black-3-20120525,0,7281374.story?track=rss",200,meninblackii8,meninblackii,latimes

Video courtesy of The Weinstein Company. By Joe Morgenstern May 24 2012 613 p.m. ET To avoid misunderstanding a French film called ""Les Intouchables""--meaning of course ""The Untouchables""--comes to us with a hybrid title ""The Intouchables."" Its not quite English but neither does it evoke crime fighters in 1930s Chicago. This hugely likable comedy a box-office phenomenon in France takes place in contemporary Paris. Loosely based on a true story it finds unlikely uplift along with tenderness in a friendship between two men who are untouchables in different ways Philippe a wealthy white aristocrat left quadriplegic by a parasailing accident; and Driss a black ex-con from the projects who becomes Philippes caretaker. Theres still room for misunderstanding in the scripts manipulation of racial and cultural stereotypes--its very French on and below the glossy surface. Yet the film fulfills its feel-good promise as long as its seen as the fairy tale it was meant to be. ENLARGE Omar Sy as Driss and Francois Cluzet as Philippe in The Intouchables. The Weinstein Company A fairy tale thats also a perfect star vehicle for Omar Sy the French comedian comic writer and television personality who makes Driss an unstoppable life force. An immigrant from Senegal with a big smile a bigger heart and a tripwire temper the caretaker transforms--and is transformed by--his paralyzed employer. Philippe is played by Francois Cluzet a superb actor who given the scripts dynamics often serves as Mr. Sys straight man. Philippe is fascinating in his own right. Thered be no movie if he werent open to being transformed or sufficiently intrigued by Drisss volcanic personality to risk a give-and-take with someone alien to his world. Yet ""The Intouchables"" becomes Mr. Sys show just as last weeks French release ""Polisse"" was dominated by the French rapper Joeystarr. Its not that both men are nonwhite but that both by virtue of their training bring outsize energies to productions shrewdly tailored to their talents. Thus does Driss make a mockery of Philippes beloved high culture--opera classical music modern art--in a series of setups that are as shameless as they are entertaining. (The best moment may be the most shameless when Driss shakes up Philippes birthday party.) And culture isnt his only target. He cant fathom why Philippe would sustain an epistolary relationship with a woman hes never seen. Pick up the phone and call her Driss says forgetting that among other impediments to love a quadriplegic cant pick up anything. When Philippe insists that all he wants is a meeting of minds we understand what he does not that hes already got a great one with Driss. Agent J travels in time to MIBs early years in the 1960s to stop an alien from assassinating his friend Agent K and changing history. Video courtesy of Sony. ""The Intouchables"" which was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano--and handsomely shot by Mathieu Vadepied--has a few odd lapses. The filmmakers are in such a hurry to get from one situation to the next that we never quite see the specific moment when Driss realizes that Philippe against all odds has actually hired him; or the moment when Driss realizes that Phillipe has sold a painting that the caretaker painted on a whim. And Driss can be a bit much when those outsize energies threaten to hurtle out of control. Mostly though the films appeal is so unerring that its easy to forget how offensive its characterizations might have seemed in other circumstances the white aesthete empowered by great wealth; the black servant jovial and companionable but still a man with a criminal past. (The real-life caretaker a Muslim named Abdel was born in Algeria.) How then does all of this qualify for fairy-tale status? For audiences in France and Western Europe the answer must have been simple given the productions remarkable commercial success--by using humanity and humor to defuse the anxieties of contemporary life. In the France of the film the nations ceaseless clash of cultures has a cheerful lilt immigration isnt a problem and theres no place for alarmist politicians like Marine Le Pen. For audiences here the social context matters little if at all but the pleasures are similar--mismatched buddies who prove to be perfectly matched happiness bought not with money but with friendship and audacity and a feel-good ending that must be felt to be believed. ENLARGE Josh Brolin in Men in Black 3. Columbia Pictures Men in Black 3 If time travel worked as well for us as it works for Will Smiths Agent J in ""Men in Black III"" we could go back to the summer of 1997 and be astonished anew by the wit and copious inventions of ""Men in Black"" the now-classic sci-fi extravaganza about alien invaders among us and the terrestrial agents who monitor their activity. Since thats not an option were left with our memories and cant help but weigh them against the memories-to-be of this latest sequel. (""MIB II"" is best and ever so easily forgotten.) ""MIB 3"" directed by Barry Sonnenfeld in excellent 3-D suffers from problems that afflict almost every time-travel plot; the script credited to Etan Cohen is all over the place not just temporally but dramatically. Still the film is packed with gorgeous effects and amusing creatures including Jemaine Clements Boris the Animal and Agent Js travels take him back to someone who makes the whole adventure truly memorable Josh Brolins Agent K as a startlingly pleasant younger man. Hes startling because the hallmark of Agent K as played until now by Tommy Lee Jones has been comical disagreeableness; K has seen it all has battled all of the life-forms a chaotic universe can concoct and is no longer amused. Mr. Jones is back as the older K in the current sequel and his presence reminds us of how deep the old cops dyspepsia runs. (It also reminds us of how predictable Mr. Jones has become in strumming that single note through all of his recent roles.) The younger mans personality is all the more startling for the skill and generosity with which Mr. Brolin creates a persuasively vital K while foreshadowing the grump to come. The script explains the change in elaborate detail but the performance defies explanation; its mysteriously marvelous. A pair of young lovers flee their New England town which causes a local search party to fan out and find them. Video courtesy of Focus Features. Moonrise Kingdom Wes Andersons beguiling and endearing ""Moonrise Kingdom"" set on a mythical island off the coast of New England in 1965 starts with kids in what appears to be an overgrown doll house listening to Benjamin Brittens ""The Young Persons Guide to the Orchestra."" Whats going on here? Is Mr. Anderson trying to imitate the storybook look and animation techniques of his previous feature ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""? Maybe yes on the look but his new film in radiant live-action is very much its own creation an adults guide to young love. (Kids may go for it too though theyre apt to mistake its sweet-spirited eccentricity for discomfiting silliness.) Eccentricity is putting it mildly. Adam Stockhausens production design and Robert D. Yeomans cinematography provide a tween toyland for the 12-year-olds at the center of the action. Jared Gilmans Sam and Kara Haywards Suzy are made for each other and they know it after meeting at a church pageant. Hes a precocious orphan with foster parents who consider him emotionally disturbed. Shes unhappy at home as well she might be with the parents fate has given her; theyre played by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand. ENLARGE Bill Murray Frances McDormand Edward Norton and Bruce Willis in Wes Andersons Moonrise Kingdom. Focus Features As in all of Mr. Andersons films the adult world does not come off well though Bruce Williss police chief stands as an exception in this one which the director wrote with Roman Coppola. The grown-ups are clueless about what to do when Sam and Suzy run away together and vanish into the wilderness while a monster storm gathers force. Whats clear to us wise old moviegoers however is that Sam in his ridiculous coonskin cap and Suzy with her luggage and binoculars are headed toward adolescence on a voyage of self-discovery and that they love each other intensely even though theyre not sure what comes next. Edward Norton is a cigarette-smoking Scoutmaster. Bob Balaban is the narrator earnestly reporting the progress of the storm as its tracked by the U.S. Department of Inclement Weather. DVD Focus ENLARGE The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (2007) Beyond quadriplegia is a mercifully rare condition called locked-in syndrome when one is fully conscious but unable to move or speak. No fate could be more frightening no premise for popular entertainment could be more improbable. Yet Julian Schnabels magnificent French-language film like its true-life subject transcends realitys prison with surreal buoyancy. The source material is a slender but celebrated memoir of the same name by Jean-Dominique Bauby who is played in radiant good health as well as the deep freeze of immobility by Mathieu Amalric. In either mode its an astonishing performance. Tell No One (2006) Guillaume Canets brilliant thriller stars Francois Cluzet as Alexandre Beck a pediatrician who has lost his beloved wife her mutilated body was found near the shore of a lake theyd been visiting since they were children. Eight years later he starts receiving cryptic emails suggesting shes still alive. From that point forward everything he thinks he knows about the circumstances of the crime and everything we think we know from a series of flashbacks dissolves in doubt or explodes into chases. The director and Philippe Lefebvre adapted the script from a novel by the American crime author Harlan Coben. Bottle Rocket (1996) Wes Andersons directorial debut which he wrote with Owen Wilson stars Mr. Wilson as Dignan a delusional master-criminal-in-training. (Almost every character that the actor has played since is Dignans spiritual descendant.) The film also stars Owens brother Luke Wilson. He plays Anthony who has recently been released from a mental hospital and who finds love though no common language with a motel maid. Fey and almost plotless ""Bottle Rocket"" sometimes seems blissed out on its own inconsequentiality. Still in an era of coldly impersonal filmmaking its a handmade heartfelt oddity with lovely moments of deadpan sweetness.

CBS NewsMen in Black 3 The Bummer of 69 The Village Voice Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Its silly to feel sorry for a big studio movie especially a second sequel bound to make buckets of money but director Barry Sonnenfelds Men in Black 3 arriving 15 years after his original and 10 after Men in Black 2 is so creaky and out of touch it inspires pity. Its opening sequences are a near marvel of confusion mayhem and embarrassments for its actors. If it was a person youd worry it had dementia. Agents K (Tommy Lee Jones) and J (Will Smith) are back but the reliable tart and taciturn vs. sweet and sassy energy between them is absent as if they filmed their scenes independently acting opposite puppets in front of a blue screen. Their banter is blather. At a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan they manage to fight off a slew of aliens. In 3-D Rick Bakers creations while never intended to be taken seriously seem goofy old-fashioned and repellent in the wrong way--that is you really dont want to look at them. Even blasting aliens in tandem K and J still arent connecting. J is needier than usual while K is brooding; an alien he locked up 40 years ago Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement from The Flight of the Conchords) has escaped from a lunar prison and is headed back in time to July 1969 just before the first moon walk to kill K. (MORE TIMEs interview with Oscar-winning makeup artist and creature maker Rick Bakers inspirations) The average moviegoer is well educated in the particulars of time travel. Even if your high school curriculum didnt include any H.G. Wells thanks to Back to the Future Terminator and dozens of other films just about everyone knows how it works. Why dont the fleet of screenwriters who cooked up this script? They have J wake up the morning after the bloodbath at the Chinese restaurant to a world already missing K. This makes no sense. Boris has gone back in time but given that he hasnt found or killed young K yet old K ought to be alive well and doing that ""sort of surly Elvis"" thing he does in contemporary Manhattan. Instead hes dead and gone and at headquarters only the boss and former paramour O (Emma Thompson 53 and playing 65 or so every actresss dream) even remembers old K. Also an alien invasion has commenced because while K was capturing Boris back in 1969 he also put up a shield that prevented anyone from Boris planet to enter the atmosphere. (One more logistical lament that would include Boris in 2009.) J goes back in time to save young K and stop the invasion. Just before he leaps J gets a warning from the guy (Michael Chernus) who lends him the time traveling device which looks like a cross between a police badge and a smart phone to be careful in 1969. ""It wasnt the best time for your people"" he cautions. J looks baffled as if being a black man today didnt include having some sense of what being a black man in 1969 was like. Maybe hes been hitting the neuralyzer in his down time. (SPECIAL What year Will Smith landed on the Time 100 list) Without Jones it must be said Men in Black 3 improves considerably. The actual time traveling sequence which starts with Smith in freefall from the Chrysler Building is the kind of special effect that makes the annoyance of the 3-D glasses worth it for a few minutes. 1969 is reasonably fun--and if anyone can pull off jokes about racial profiling it is the ever-likeable Will Smith. Theres an entertaining run-in with Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) and the whole Factory gang and a few sweet scenes with a Mork-like alien (Michael Stuhlbarg who starred in the Coens A Serious Man). But the best reason for going back in time and really when it comes down to it the only reason to see Men in Black 3 is Josh Brolin who plays young K. His Tommy Lee Jones voice is not that far removed from the George Bush voice he used in W. but he hits all those querulous notes just right. Posture body language Brolin nails it; his sideways glance is pure poetry of Tommy Lee-ness. Even if you love Jones and many of us do it can be hard to distinguish between his characters--so often maximum misanthropes--and his suffer-no-fools public persona. In his brief scenes in Men in Black 3 which mercifully only constitute 10 or so minutes of screen time Jones gives the impression that hes genuinely miserable being there. Meanwhile Brolin looks like hes having the time of his life playing a youthful curmudgeon and he reminds us what was so delightful about Jones and his taciturn routine in the first place. J keeps looking at young cool K and shaking his head. ""What happened to you?"" he wants to know. For Jones likely a case of sustained sequelitis.

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Men In Black 3 Director Barry Sonnenfeld Genre Sci-Fi Action Comedy Running Time 106 minutes Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence and brief suggestive content With Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin Emma Thompson From the Department of Inessentiality Summer Division comes Men in Black 3 one of those franchises that lost all creative life in the first sequel but keep drawing breath anyway thanks to an iron lung powered by a half-billion dollars in worldwide grosses. The concept of a secret agency devoted to controlling Earths undercover alien population can only seem novel once and the Odd Couple dynamic between Will Smiths chatty effervescent newcomer and Tommy Lee Jones irascible veteran has a shelf life too. To merely rinse and repeat for the third entry adding only new creatures and the obligatory 3-D effects would have buried it deeper into the ground. Introducing time travel to a series that has never raised that possibility sounds like a desperate ploy drafting off Back to the Future much like young Marty McFly drafted off cars on his skateboard. Perhaps it wouldnt seem like a stretch for such a high-tech agency to disrupt the space-time continuum but taking the franchise out of its natural habitat is what happened when Fonzie jumped the shark. Perhaps thats why it took a full decade to make the second Men in Black sequel. And yet director Barry Sonnenfeld working from a script by Etan Cohen (Tropic Thunder) gets just enough juice out of the time-travel idea to give Men in Black 3 a lift. A plot that has Smiths Agent J going back to 1969 to save his partner -- and the world -- allows for ample opportunities to riff on American history and introduces an uncanny Josh Brolin as Jones younger self which twists a tired buddy-movie partnership in subtle and often clever new directions. i Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) plays young Agent K the target in 1969 of an attack by a time-traveling alien that threatens to change the future. Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men) plays young Agent K the target in 1969 of an attack by a time-traveling alien that threatens to change the future. Sony Pictures As the film opens a dangerous new threat emerges in ""Boris the Animal"" a creature so deadly that he has spent the past 40 years chained up in a prison on the moon. The man who put him there? None other than Jones Agent K who shot off Boris arm in the process. When Boris escapes from prison steals a time-travel device and goes back to July 16 1969 to kill K in a showdown at Cape Canaveral J sets his own device 24 hours earlier in an attempt to warn his future partner and avoid a full-on alien invasion. Though there are some callbacks to the first two movies Men in Black 3 doesnt expect viewers to remember some complicated mythology -- in that respect it serves as its own memory-wiping ""neuralizer"" -- and the streamlined plot is unusual and refreshing for a time-travel movie. (Just dont think about the what-ifs for too long.) Sonnenfelds best movies function like elaborate Rube Goldberg contraptions with visual gags popping out on a precise calibration of gears and springs and Cohens script however derivative is a stable apparatus. As soon as Smith makes a leap in time zipping past dinosaurs and plunging through a World War II ticker-tape parade Sonnenfeld turns Men in Black 3 into an alternate history that operates somewhere between a Warner Brothers cartoon and the cantina scene in Star Wars. Within the 24-hour window the film zips from Andy Warhols Factory to the Apollo 11 launch while keeping up a lively banter between Smith and Brolins K who hasnt quite calcified into the mirthless grouch that hell have become 40 years later. Though other newcomers like Flight of the Conchords co-star Jemaine Clement (as Boris) and A Serious Mans Michael Stuhlbarg (as an alien who can see possible futures) make strong impressions Men in Black 3 belongs to Brolin whose Tommy Lee Jones impersonation is so scarily precise that it often sounds like Jones is overdubbing him. But its not just skillful caricature either When the film gets sentimental about J and Ks friendship Brolin finds the right emotional register as a young agent who isnt quite set in his ways. In a franchise that could also be too set in its ways his flexibility makes all the difference.

Our reviewer asks Why? Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Aliens again. ""Men in Black 3"" revives the long-dormant franchise for an inessential new chapter in Hollywoods never- ending story of Earth guys battling space intruders. This third go-round throws lots of talent at the screen from the effects-cluttered frames to the A-list supporting cast featuring Josh Brolin Jemaine Clement and Emma Thompson. Maybe 40 percent of it sticks. On the other hand theres the patched-together script haphazard direction and an ending that given the level of expectations for the series isnt exciting enough. Its OK. Once again the key to the film is Will Smiths self-deprecating charm and easy chemistry with capable co-star Tommy Lee Jones. As field agents for a secret interplanetary version of the Immigration and Naturalization Service they keep tabs on Earths resident aliens hunting down undesirables and using neuralyzer wands to impose amnesia on any civilian who observes them in action. When the series debuted in 1997 the concept was fresh and sparky with lean uncluttered storytelling. It was huge fun. But once the idea was established -- our planet is a ""Star Wars"" cantina of extraterrestrials in disguise -- wed reached the punch line. It looked like the end of the line in 2002s terminally bloated ""MIB2."" A decade after that untidy sequel whats left to carry the story is the ingenuity of makeup master Rick Bakers ingenious alien designs and the performances of Jones as battle-hardened grouch Agent K and Smith as his upbeat partner J. Its still an effective pairing. Jones seems to live for heavy sighs and barked commands; Smith has aged out of the eager-beaver protege role but he still has a puckish lightness of spirit. Even if the scene is nothing more than the two of them eating pie at a diner theyre fun to watch. This outing makes an effort to freshen the mix with a time-travel plot. Director Barry Sonnenfeld a fan of ham-fisted comedy establishes the cartoonish tone at the outset. His camera leers as a slinky prison visitor (former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger) delivers an extremely suspicious pink cake to blustering villain Boris (Clement all gnashing teeth and basso profundo growls). A few explosions later Boris is back on his alien motorcycle abetting an invasion force of giant floating jellyfish. Worse K vanishes into a temporal wrinkle leaving J no partner with whom to banter. Wilson Webb Sony Pictures Tommy Lee Jones right and Will Smith star are shown in a scene from ""Men in Black 3."" To rescue K and thwart the alien assault J must travel back to 1969 on the day of a historic U.S. rocket launch. There he meets a younger version of K (Brolin doing a knockout Jones impersonation) who is a lot more agreeable than the vinegary sourpuss of 2012. The action builds to a scene of four-man fisticuffs atop Apollo 11 as its about to lift off. Theres a touch of desperation about the back-to-the-future ploy. Michael Stuhlbarg (""A Serious Man"") appears as a fifth-dimensional idiot savant assigned with giving the audience unedifying explanations of the laws of time travel. It all sounds pretty arbitrary frankly. Sonnenfeld depends on crashing action and hyperventilating camera moves to puff up the slack blimp of a story. Unfortunately theres one effect that computer-animation technicians can never duplicate a genuine sense of fun. ""MIB3"" is at its best when it throttles back the action to admire its actors. As the new head of the MIB agency Thompson brings her luminous intelligence to bear on not very inspired jokes improving them immensely. Jones grimaces and sighs eloquently and Smith has a cracklingly funny scene when he runs afoul of 1969 racial profiling. Brolins performance goes beyond mimicry to something authentically touching in a poignant scene at the conclusion. Even in a brief cameo Bill Hader scores as Andy Warhol whose studio is presented as a hangout for artsy E.T.s. Still these moments are more like skits than elements of a coherent plot. I liked bits and pieces of the film but I never felt the jigsaw puzzle was fully assembled.

"Men in Black III | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; men-in-black-iii ) Men in Black III (United States 2012) May 24 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The problem with some franchises is that the studios dont know when its time to quit. The lackluster nature of Men in Black II should have been a hint to Sony that the Men in Black series had run its course. Now at least ten years beyond the ""sell by"" date along comes Men in Black III. This sequel is so lifeless and pointless that it moves beyond ""unnecessary"" into the realm of ""unwanted"" and ""insulting."" The publics lack of enthusiasm for this movie is matched only by the apparent disinterest evident in the production. Those who dont understand what it means for an actor to ""sleepwalk"" through a performance need only watch Men in Black III; theres no shortage of examples. If there was reason to be bullish about Men in Black III going in it was that the three principals - actors Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones and director Barry Sonnenfeld - had returned. But Smith gives the impression he wants to be elsewhere. Jones appears to be still playing his role from No Country for Old Men. And Sonnenfelds work behind the camera is no more than adequate. The chemistry between J (Smith) and K (Jones) has evaporated. The quips traded by J and K have lost their bite; theyre obligatory. I imagine this is how it might be if Riggs and Murtaugh were exhumed for another Lethal Weapon. Theres so little humor in the final cut that all of the jokes were used in the trailer. Its sad. The story involves time travel. There are two ways to handle this overused plot device with at least cursory consideration of the paradoxes involved (think Back to the Future or Star Trek IV) or by employing a seat-of-the-pants approach that is more appropriate for a cartoon. No points for guessing which one is at work in Men in Black III. In fact the screenplay feels frustratingly incomplete with significant plot points left unresolved. (What it is the ""big moment"" that changes K? And please dont tell me its the lame thing that happens near the end.) Its as if the movie went into production without a script and the filmmakers made things up as they went along. Such an approach can arguably work for a comedy but Men in Black III is easily the least funny of the three films skewing more toward sci-fi and action while muting the humor. The lack of narrative coherence therefore represents a major drawback. Men in Black III opens with a jailbreak. Ks arch-nemesis Boris (Jermaine Clement) finds a way to escape his maximum security prison cell on the moon. Once he has returned to Earth he tries unsuccessfully to kill J and K. Failing at that he time travels back to 1969 and helps his younger self eliminate K on the day of Apollo 11s historical lift-off. Because he drinks chocolate milk J is immune to the way reality is re-shaped around the temporal shift and realizes something had gone wrong. After a consultation with the Men in Blacks new leader O (Emma Thompson) J makes his own time jump. This reunites him with a much younger K (now played by Josh Brolin) and puts them on a collision course with both Borises in an attempt to repair the damage done to time. Or something like that. If theres a bright spot to be found in Men in Black III its Josh Brolin whose dead-on impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones makes the real actor seem like an imposter. Brolin seems to be having fun which is more than can be said about the people sitting in theater seats enduring this shit. Theres also something odd about Jones make-up job. Its unclear whether its intended to make him look older or younger. The actor is 65; we learn that K is supposedly 72. It makes no sense however that latex applications would be used to add seven years to Jones age. The end result is that the actor looks like a waxwork from Madame Tussauds that has been left out in the sun too long and is starting to melt. Visually Men in Black III looks like it was made on a budget roughly equivalent to that of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The CGI is awful the ""creature effects"" are about 30 years out-of-date and the 3-D is an abomination. Its inexplicable why anyone thought Men in Black III would be improved by the darkening and blurriness that accompanies a poor post-production conversion but thats the case here. All the usual problems with inept 3-D are in evidence. (The company to do the work on Men in Black III is reportedly the same one that botched Clash of the Titans and The Green Lantern.) Still considering the quality of the project this isnt a case where its better avoiding the surcharge and seeing the 2-D version; this is a case where its better avoiding it in any D. Most summers theres a sequel that underperforms relative to expectations. My money is on Men in Black III for 2012. Its hard to imagine how any movie-goer could legitimately claim to be entertained by this mess. The action is sloppy and limited. The comedy is perfunctory. The lack of energy and craftsmanship is shocking. Its a poor option even as a temporary diversion. (To add insult to injury there is no post-credits Easter egg.) Men in Black III is to this franchise what Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was to that one. Its hard to be more definitive about how this movie experience plays out.

(Wilson Webb) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday May 24 2012 1200 PM Title Men in Black 3 Film Info With Will Smith Josh Brolin Tommy Lee Jones. Agent J travels back to 1969 to save the planet with his future partner. Director Barry Sonnenfeld (145). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters. The producers of ""Men in Black 3"" must have blown enough on computerized graphics to subsidize a colony on the moon. But really they spent all they needed on flesh-and-blood humans. Theres no way to know what Josh Brolin got for signing up with Barry Sonnenfelds intergalactic action franchise. Even so hed be well within his rights to double his rate for ""MIB4."" The movies uncanny casting -- in which Brolin plays the younger version of Tommy Lee Jones Agent K -- is certainly its most memorable element. But of course neither of those formidable gentlemen is this series true star. That status belongs to Will Smith and after three years out of the spotlight its clear hes ready to grab it back. Jones is pushed offscreen early and rather unceremoniously after an evil alien named Boris (Jemaine Clement) is discovered to be planning Earths destruction. Agent J (Smith) has to time-travel back to the 60s when Agent K (Jones) first met Boris and chose not to kill him. The plan is for J to erase this villain in 1969 so he wont exist to wreak havoc in 2012. Once in the 60s J meets up with Ks younger slightly hipper self (Brolin). K is skeptical of this stranger who claims to be from the future but soon theyre working side by side. Even better they have the chance to bond in a way the 21st-century pair rarely experience. Brolin is such a perfect match for Jones and Smith so confidently charismatic that everything else seems like a distraction. The critical drubbing of ""MIB2"" 10 years ago may have reminded Sonnenfeld that money cant replace a well-crafted script and sharp direction. So now the aliens feel like an amusing sideshow rather than the main event. The actors connect as partners rather than celebrities cashing a giant paycheck. And the satisfyingly grand finale is brought back to human scale with a genuinely emotional revelation. Then again its probably wise not to oversell the movies popcorn ambitions. The jokes are comical but rarely hilarious while the 3D action is more energetic than truly rousing. And not all of the casting is impeccable. The bland Alice Eve for example is a distractingly poor choice to represent young Emma Thompson (as Agent O). But thats okay Compared to its bloated predecessor these are minor complaints. A solidly entertaining summer movie is always welcome even if it cant quite claim to be out of this world.

In Theaters May 25 2012 . Stars Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin . Photo Credit Columbia Pictures/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A government agent travels back in time to save his partner and the planet. BOTTOM LINE No longer the cutting-edge franchise it once was but Josh Brolin playing a younger Tommy Lee Jones pumps fresh blood into the movie. CAST Will Smith Josh Brolin Tommy Lee Jones LENGTH 146 Containing a conspiracy was so easy in 1997 the year ""Men in Black"" introduced Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as the sleek-suited alien-tracking agents J and K who handily wiped out many a memory using a pen-sized device called a neuralizer. Pretty neat but that was before cameraphones Twitter and WikiLeaks made secrecy seem so well outdated. So how does ""Men in Black 3"" address the past 15 years of technology? Simple by traveling back to a time before it existed. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? That idea isnt terribly original but it works much like this breezy mostly entertaining movie. The franchise is no longer the zenith of blockbusterism and the gooey effects from Hollywood veteran Rick Baker look overly familiar but ""Men in Black 3"" remains an amiable comedy with some fondly familiar faces. The loosey-goosey Smith almost wipes out our memory of his mopey ""Seven Pounds"" and Jones reinhabits the surly K as if no time at all had passed. In ""Men in Black 3"" J goes back to 1969 to foil the plans of Boris the Boglodite (a memorably weird Jemaine Clement) with the help of a time-sensitive humanoid named Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg more cloying than endearing). Bill Hader as Andy Warhol and Alice Eve as a pretty agent with a ""Mad Men"" coif provide the 60s humor but the heart of the film is Josh Brolin as a younger cheerier K. His rendition of a 29-year-old Jones is dead-on funny but its also so deeply informed -- the Texas twang the unamused stare -- that it borders on biopic quality. Barry Sonnenfeld directs with his usual vertiginous flair even if his attempts at up-to-the-minute humor generally fall flat. Lady Gaga is an alien? Anyone with a Twitter account knew that. 048 VideoMen in Black III premiere PLOT A government agent travels back in time to save his partner and the planet. RATING PG-13 (violence and gooey effects) advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Will Smith Josh Brolin Tommy Lee Jones LENGTH 146 PLAYING AT Area theaters some in IMAX and 3-D BOTTOM LINE No longer the cutting-edge franchise it once was but Josh Brolin playing a younger Tommy Lee Jones pumps fresh blood into the movie. VideoTrailer Men in Black 3 Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Men 3 a very expensive sequel As the new installment of the 15-year-old franchise ""Men in Black"" proves getting to the big screen isnt always a cakewalk. One of the most troubled productions in recent Hollywood memory Sony Pictures latest movie in the Will Smith-Tommy Lee Jones sci-fi-comedy franchise encountered multiple script rewrites a discontented star and a three-month production shutdown as writers and studio executives scrambled to fix a project that nearly fell apart. 141 VideoThe Men in Black are back By the time it was over the studio had run up a tab of nearly 250 million -- making ""Men in Black 3"" one of the most expensive releases of the summer. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""With something like Men in Black a sequel is actually more difficult than the original"" said Walter Parkes who has produced all three films. ""The challenge is to be fresh and original but also deliver on the core values of the franchise."" It was a family trip to Southeast Asia about three years ago that convinced Parkes that ""Men in Black"" still resonated around the world; he spotted locals watching the original movie on TV in an airport. Smith meanwhile had a long-gestating concept for a new movie involving time travel. -- Los Angeles Times Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

(AP Photo/Columbia Pictures-Sony Wilson Webb) Columbia Pictures A scene from ""Men in Black 3."" Columbia Pictures photo Before there were talkies with screenplays there were moving pictures and impressive images are still an effective way to hypnotize us into liking mediocre movies. ""Men in Black 2"" was a so-so sequel to a blockbuster sci-fi comedy but the sets and effects were as groovy as the original and I confess that I fell for the bait-and-switch.The threequel ""Men in Black 3"" is both more and less of the same. It still has cool creatures and 1960s set design and the 3-D is the best of the season but if you try to remember the story or jokes youll find that youve been hit by a neuralyzer beam.In the decade since the last installment little has changed. The Men in Black agency still keeps the Earths alien population under wraps and Agent J (Will Smith) is still trying to unwrap the human side of gruff Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones). It turns out theres a reason for Ks crustiness and his name is Boris (Jemaine Clement). Reptilian biker Boris (dont you dare call him Boris the Animal) is the last of the bloodthirsty bogladites and has been locked in a lunar prison since a failed invasion in 1969. But Boris breaks out with a plan to reverse time restore his amputated arm and revenge the bogladite race against Agent K.The time-travel gimmick brings out the best in the movies technical team and it opens up a role for Josh Brolin as a younger and slightly more sensitive version of Agent K. But while Smith is still the center of attention the script by Etan Cohen doesnt leverage enough of the comic possibilities in J following the trail (re)introducing himself to his skeptical partner and adjusting to life before black was beautiful. Indeed the best scenes belong to Michael Stuhlberg as a sweet-but-spacey alien who can envision every possible twist of fate. The final twist involving Js childhood circa the moon launch might be considered poignant in an alternate universe but an invasion by real-life emotions would spoil the ration of fun here. ""Men in Black 3"" is all surface but as with the moon the surface can steal our attention ""Men in Black 3""Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 145  Content Sci-fi action violence and brief suggestive content Videos Watch a trailer for Men in Black 3 May 24 2012 (...)

"Men in blech A most unnecessary sequel |       NJ.com comments Men in blech A most unnecessary sequel Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 24 2012 at 800 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1050 AM View/Post Comments Wilson WebbWill Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back again. In his new film Will Smith goes back in time to stop a very very bad thing from happening. Its a dangerous mission and one with only a small chance of success. Obviously he fails. Because if he succeeded we wouldnt all be faced with ""Men in Black III"" now would we? In the world of unnecessary sequels -- a densely inhabited world and one those slime-busting dark-suited federal agents should really clean up -- this film may stand as one of the most unnecessary. After all the last ""Men in Black"" was 10 years ago. And while it wasnt wonderful it ended with such a terrific pseudo-profound blows-my-mind-man ending the franchise seemed complete. I mean what more could you want? Another paycheck maybe. And so Smith and Tommy Lee Jones -- who is beginning to look like a very old and cranky shar-pei searching for a sunny spot to snooze -- are back in black and back chasing aliens who are threatening the universe. Same old same old. The one new thing that ""Men in Black III"" has going for it is that when Smith goes back to 1969 to avert the coming catastrophe he meets up with a younger version of Jones -- who turns out to be Josh Brolin. (And that gives Jones the opportunity to pretty much exit the film and maybe find that patch of sunlight.) Its the films smartest move. We saw Brolins gift of mimicry in ""W"" and he gets the stoic twang of the older actor exactly right here. But hes also very very good. Just as he was in ""No Country for Old Men."" And in ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger."" And in ""Milk"" where he resisted the temptation to demonize his character. Brolin deserves bigger juicier parts. And we deserve better than ""Men in Black III"" which has a lot of 3-D special effects and a lot of chase scenes but no real sense of fun. If it werent for ""The Avengers"" youd begin to think -- after ""Dark Shadows"" after ""Battleship"" -- that Hollywood didnt know how to make a big summer movie anymore. Maybe they accidentally looked into their own version of that memory-erasing neuralyzer. Of course Brolin is terrific and Smith is still charming and its always nice to see Emma Thompson even wasted in a small part taking over from Rip Torn as the mens boss. Theres also a lovely appearance by Michael Stuhlbarg as a sweetly smiling alien who can see the future -- every possible one of them. But the busy dizzy story strains belief even for a time-travel plot about secret government agents chasing intergalactic villains. Theres a lot of too-fast-to-follow exposition and several things that make no sense at all (after-effects perhaps of rushing into production before your script is actually finished). So yes it really is too bad that Smith couldnt go back in time and stop this thing. Although you can always take an extra-dimensional trip yourself simply by digging that first ""Men in Black"" DVD off your shelf -- and reliving a past when this franchise was fresh and funny. Ratings note The film contains violence. Men in Black III (PG-13) Columbia (106 min.) Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. With Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin. Now playing in New Jersey.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 24 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 222PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The first was a delightful surprise so much lighter and wittier and best of all brisker than your generic lumbering blockbuster. Just as decidedly the second was not. Now with sole steward Barry Sonnenfeld again at the directors controls MIB 3 - thats Men In Black Three-Peat for the uninitiated - has a chance to win the rubber match. Yes another franchise is back and at first the thing appears as ossified as the fissures in Tommy Lee Joness craggy mug. But then what comes back goes back retreating in time to the busy summer of 1969 and in the mists of the past damned if an old tune doesnt find some new energy. Delight a modest yet palpable measure of the stuff is restored. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Men in Black 3"" starring Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin Movies Men in Black 3 The official trailer In a nifty little reversal we start with a woman in black a sexpot in leather who frees the villain of the piece from his lunar prison. That would be Boris the Animal. Hes a one-armed baddie who has a bikers beard binoculars for eyes and a lethal case of crabs - they keep erupting from his alien corpus to claw the unsuspecting. Meanwhile back on the good Earth K (Jones in de rigueur undertaker duds and shades) is looking as galaxy-weary as ever. Alas so is the first act. The K-J banter with partner Will Smith errs on the tired side a shootout at a chow mein palace is just action-scene rote and Smith speaks for us all when he opines to his buddy ""Im getting too old for this. I can only imagine how you feel."" Happily and not a moment too soon the plot rears its murky head. Sure as ever in these matters it defies comprehension but it does have the singular merit of plunging J into ""some sort of temporal fracture."" Translation He makes a leap back in time; in this case a literal jump off a towering Manhattan skyscraper. Way up there Sonnenfeld puts his 3D camera to potent use. The vertigo is disorienting and delicious - we feel dizzyingly high. Tumbling through the decades our boy lands in the heat of July 69 where he hooks up with a much younger K and where the movie embeds a wonderfully sustained sight-and-sound gag - Josh Brolin doing an uncanny impression of Tommy Lee Jones right down to the last clipped consonant. His theft of the actors whole persona is eerily accurate and the gag never gets tired. Neither does an amusing set-piece foray to The Factory. There in a tinfoil space where ""everybody looks like an alien"" the men in noir encounter a whiter shade of Warhol. Cant spoil the joke but beneath his platinum wig it seems that Andy was harbouring quite the ivory secret. Here Sonnenfeld regains his form from the original encouraging both the extraterrestrial critters and the tossed-off yuks to creep up quietly from the edges of the frame (""Were meeting with the Viagrans - they have a revolutionary new pill""). The front-and-centre exception is Griffin which affords another terrific actor Michael Stuhlbarg the opportunity to engage in some thievery of his own stealing every scene hes in. Doe-eyed but fast-talking sporting a ski tuque with ear flaps his anxious alien has the capacity to entertain multiple possible realities simultaneously including the most unlikely of all. In a visit to the rough diamond of old Shea Stadium he hypothesizes that a bunch of perennial losers just might a few months hence transform themselves into ""the miracle Mets."" Like that would ever happen. The ensuing action isnt much but that too is refreshing - its not really meant to be. Instead the climax unfolds on a piece of real estate thats all about location location location. Atop the giant erector set of the actual moon launch ensconced in their capsule Neil and company the factual heroes take a back seat to their fictional counterparts. Apparently men in black suits had to save the Earth before mankind in spacesuits could make that giant leap. Eventually the picture even explains the source of those many crags in Joness weathered mug He confesses that his fiercest battles are fought with the demon of regret. Of course thats the same internal alien that typically worms its way into every movie franchise inviting ennui and spreading disappointment and inflating boredom. But this time at least for a few acts back in time the demon has been tamed.

"Men in Black 3 (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Men in Black 3 (PG-13) Josh Brolin and some spectacular 3D effects are the only bright spots in the third installment of the sci-fi comedy series. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/24/2012 Editor rating 1 In order to make its target release date Men in Black 3 started shooting without a completed script. Now the movie is out and Im pretty sure the screenplay was never finished. Etan Cohen (Tropic Thunder) is credited as the writer although several other folks took passes at it. Cohen was just the guy who drew the short straw and wound up with his name in the credits. Its a tough break because the blame for this crass empty movie doesnt really rest with him. No the people to blame for this cash-grab are Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones and director Barry Sonnenfeld and the studio executives who pushed forward with Men in Black 3 even though no one actually remembered or even liked Men in Black 2 because they knew audiences would line up to see it no matter what. All they needed to sell the film was enough footage to make an appealing trailer which they got courtesy of Josh Brolin playing a younger version of Agent K (Jones) in 1969. Brolin has been on a roll of great performances (No Country For Old Men W True Grit Milk) but he rarely gets an opportunity to play funny and he seems delighted by the chance to do it here. His impersonation of Jones deadpan voice and inexpressive demeanor and clipped curt sentences is so uncanny he outshines every single special effect in the movie -- and this is a film that has some sort of computer-generated trickery in almost every shot. But Brolins amusing performance is not enough to justify the rest of this enormous expensive folly. Every other actor in Men in Black 3 look utterly bored and unengaged -- even the ones playing aliens. Smith is a hugely charismatic star who always gives his all even when hes stranded in a dud such as Wild Wild West (another train wreck Sonnenfeld directed). Here though he appears hesitant even uncertain that dusting off the black suit and shades for one more go-around was a good idea. The plot of Men in Black 3 requires Agent J (Smith) to travel back in time to keep his partner from being assassinated. But aside from an interesting scene in which Smith is rudely reminded that civil rights were radically different 40 years ago the movie has little use for its period setting. Instead you get hoary gags about oversized cell phones and a cameo by Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) who turns out to have been friendly with aliens all along. Men in Black 3 fumbles all its opportunities to play around with the paradoxes inherent in time travel A new character (played by Michael Stuhlbarg) has the ability to see the future but the film uses him primarily for schmaltz and sentiment. Theres a big revelation near the end of the movie thats supposed to put a lump in your throat but it makes you gag instead. Who goes to see a Men in Black picture to get choked up? Werent these films intentionally designed to be irreverent and goofy? The one thing Men in Black 3 unquestionably has going for it is its look. Sonnenfeld was a cinematographer before he became a director (he shot Millers Crossing and Raising Arizona for the Coen brothers) and he knows how to compose beautiful shiny images that beg for a freeze-frame button so you can study them closer. The special effects are terrific -- when Smith is standing on one of the iconic gargoyles of the Chrysler building he really looks like hes up there -- and the 3D is the best Ive seen since Avatar or maybe just the best period. Men in Black 3 is so dull and empty its the first movie that has ever made me think ""Thank God this is in 3D.""

By the time Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles rolled around in 2001 15 years after the first Crocodile Dundee became a surprise blockbuster the title character had been given an awfully long time to grow acclimated to those kooky Americans. Men In Black 3 finagles its way out of this predicament by literally resetting the clock with a time-travel premise that makes Will Smith both a contemporary intergalactic cop in the late 1960s and a stranger to Josh Brolin who plays the younger version of Smiths stone-faced future partner Tommy Lee Jones. Smith returns in Men In Black 3 as a veteran agent of a secret organization dedicated to policing the earths many extraterrestrials. Hes forced to travel back to 1969 to prevent an evil alien (a shockingly effective nearly unrecognizable Jemaine Clement of Flight Of The Conchords playing sort of a psychotic extraterrestrial-biker serial killer) from destroying the world by killing Brolin. Smith is aided in his quest by an elfin time-jumping alien with psychic powers played by another Coen brothers veteran A Serious Man star Michael Stuhlbarg. Men In Black 3 lacks the novelty of the first film and its take on the late 60s feels an awful lot like a psychedelic dress-up party all broad caricatures and groovy vibes. But the film is largely redeemed by an unexpected emotional resonance befitting a Steven Spielberg production. Jones sad eyes betray a pervasive pain his purposefully spare dialogue only hints at while the perfectly cast Brolin conveys hints of playfulness and warmth while staying true to the craggy stoicism at the characters core. Men In Black 3 benefits from a cast as equipped to handle drama as action-adventure and comedy. In the abstract Stuhlbargs twinkly-eyed sidekick suggests Joe Pesci in Lethal Weapon 2 by way of late-period Robin Williams with an alien twist but Stuhlbarg makes a character that easily could have come across as precious into a surprisingly palatable even charming man. Barry Sonnenfelds mildly overachieving film isnt essential but it finds just enough ways to justify its existence beyond the insatiable demands of commerce.

For all the millions of dollars spent on digital astonishments in ""Men in Black 3"" the films most remarkable special effect is an analog one. Its the carbon-based Josh Brolin who plays a younger version of Tommy Lee Joness Agent K with an uncanny replication of the older actors bearing and vocal mannerisms. Brolins performance is funny masterful confident and more than a little unsettling. If one human being can sample another thats whats going on here.The rest of ""Men in Black 3"" is about as good as one could hope for from an unnecessary sequel thats a decade late to the party. The films opening act is a painful forced march that reintroduces the main characters -- alien-containment agents K (Jones) and J (Will Smith) -- and struggles to recapture the tone of deadpan action-comedy that made the original 1997 ""Men in Black"" a blockbuster charm (and the lack of which made 2002s ""Men in Black 2"" instantly forgettable).Theres a cumbersome plot to set up about a rampaging alien baddie named Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"" under heavy latex and screw-in goggles) who escapes to the past and kills off his nemesis K forcing J to go further back in time to save the day. There are old jokes about celebrity aliens and brain-wiping neuralyzers dusted off but not made fresh. Worse theres a thankless appearance by Emma Thompson as agency chief O shrieking like an alien fish.Once Smith time-trips back to 1969 though -- he has to leap off the Chrysler building in a sequence thats a triumph of Looney Tunes action silliness -- ""Men in Black 3"" picks up and becomes deft absurdist entertainment. The script (credited to Etan Cohen with a lot of other hands in the batter) doesnt bother with culture-clash gags a la the current ""Dark Shadows."" One of the few times the movie stoops to play with the time period is when J and his newly young partner pay a visit to the Warhol Factory where the vibe seems more Summer of Love than Downtown Hipster and where we learn a few surprising things about Andy (Bill Hader).The story line too feels pro forma -- a mad scramble through Coney Island Shea Stadium Cape Canaveral and other landmarks as the agents chase Boris (both his 1969 and 2012 incarnations) while trying to get a MacGuffin atop the NASA rocket heading for the moon. Director Barry Sonnenfeld returning to the series for the third time keeps it as loose and rubbery as he can and his taste for exuberant wide-angle camerawork dovetails nicely with the films post-production conversion to 3-D. He treats the technology as the whimsical joke it is and in sequences like that time-jump and a goofy detour to a bowling alley out of ""GoodFellas"" Sonnenfeld more than rises to the occasion.The same goes for Smith even if hes effectively the series straight man by now. A reliable pro the star nuances the creaking dialogue takes it manfully through a ridiculous final twist and stands back before the two performances that make ""Men in Black 3"" actually worth something. One belongs to Michael Stuhlbarg (""A Serious Man"" ""Hugo"") as Griffin a scruffy beaming alien in a parka and wool hat. Griffins race has the ability to see all possible futures at once -- its like something out of a short story by Borges -- and while that gift might render you or me into a lump of terrified protoplasm Stuhlbarg plays the character as an addled saint. Every scene with Griffin is a small miracle of conceptual comedy that makes the rest of the movie seem like the hardware it is.The other performance is Brolins a feat of egolessness in which one actor completely subsumes himself into the style and sound of another. The performance works as an optical illusion Our eye sees Brolin but our brain is fooled into seeing Agent K and through him the craggy beloved Jones made youthful again. ""Men in Black 3"" is essentially a bait-and-switch -- a movie that promises one star and delivers another -- but because the imposture is so well-crafted so serenely inventive we accept the bargain. As far as the studio sees it everybody wins Tommy Lee Jones gets a paycheck and a vacation while the young audiences of America are spared the horror of spending 106 minutes with an old person.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Aside that is from keeping the peace on Earth between humans and aliens waving neuralizers around to wipe out peoples memories and bickering in the way of odd-couple partners in comedies? With so many movie extraterrestrials to keep track of over the past 10 years even a studious MIB fan can be excused for feeling a bit neuralized too. Among the many pleasures of Men in Black 3 (available in hip-and-happening 3-D) is the nimble efficiency with which the movie reestablishes the old MIB conventions -- all those fabulously ornate Rick Baker-designed creatures all that Jones crustiness and Smith slickness -- and then just as gracefully finds something new to do with the boys and their Ray-Bans. To move forward the story jumps backwards -- to the summer of 1969 when the Mets were destined to win the World Series and astronauts were preparing to walk on the moon. The first time 1969 came around K put the Mad Max-ish alien known as Boris the Animal (a tasty role for Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement) in prison. Now some 40 years later Boris has busted out of the clink -- on the moon by the way -- and slipped through the space-time continuum back to 1969 intent on killing K. So MIBs present-day chief O (Emma Thompson) dispatches Agent J to do a quick job of tinkering with history safeguarding the world and rescuing his partner all without getting trapped in 1969 for good. This is a winning plan for a lot of reasons beginning with the axiom that as the crew of the USS Enterprise demonstrated in Star Trek IV The Voyage Home back in ancient 1986 its always fun when fancy folks from the sci-fi future are forced to fumble with the less elegant technology of the past. Working with a model screenplay by Etan Cohen (who co-wrote the brilliant Tropic Thunder) MIBs auteur director Barry Sonnenfeld captures the nostalgic hopefulness of the era. But most of all MIB3 is one giant leap for mankind because Josh Brolin shows up to play the younger Agent K. And he just nails the feat triumphantly creating a riff on/homage to the Tommy Lee Jones-ness of K that goes much deeper (and funnier) than a simple imitation of drawl and speech patterns. Brolin conjures up a man in full just as taciturn but not nearly as closed as the craggy puss he is when Jones does the squinting. Its a great performance one for the thespian yearbook. And as happens in the best of cases Brolin raises his costars game. For an African-American Hollywood superstar like Smith marching his character backwards to 1969 presents unique opportunities for social commentary on changing perceptions of American black men. Smith makes big statements with the most casual and charming of reactions and line readings. Sonnenfeld and Cohen move their baby along with an integrity and gait that ought to serve as a blueprint for other filmmakers faced with the particular challenges of reviving big-ticket and time-dated hunks of pop culture. Amid the mayhem the movie is sophisticated enough to note the family resemblance between Rick Baker-stitched aliens and the human creatures who populated Andy Warhols Factory in the downtown Manhattan of 1969. And even while Brolins K is embroiled in a high-tension climactic showdown with Boris -- at Cape Canaveral on the day the Apollo 11 crew blasted off for the moon -- theres air and space enough in the movie to evoke the real awe of that day that time. The film isnt afraid of emotional truth. Which is why in the end Men in Black 3 would be nothing without the participation of the alien called Griffin. Played with melting sweetness by the wonderful Michael Stuhlbarg Griffin has the gift -- and curse -- of seeing the future or more specifically seeing multiple equally possible futures some swell and some less so. Griffins eyes are a misty blue and he wears a little wool hat and a perpetual worried smile. Hes gentle and patient and he wishes the best for humankind but he cant guarantee it. Likewise there was no guarantee that after so long an absence there would be anything fresh to say about Men in Black. Yet behold it is good.

"Review Men in Black 3 - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Men in Black 3By Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury NewsPosted 05/23/2012 120000 PM PDTUpdated 05/23/2012 021949 PM PDT In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers SOUTH BAY Search showtimes theaters EAST BAY Search showtimes theaters Chernobyl Diaries Hysteria Men in Black 3 Polisse Whores Glory Like an alien trapped in a human host a better movie is itching to burst out of ""Men in Black 3.""Coming 10 years after the meaningless ""Men in Black 2"" this better more ambitious sequel cant wash away a powerful eau-de-why-bother stench of that one though it does deserve props for furthering the odd-couple relationship between likable government alien-busters -- the taciturn Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and the blabbermouthed Agent J (Will Smith).But ""Blacks"" good intentions to add more emotional complexity get sideswiped by a hit-and-miss screenplay from Etan Cohen (co-writer of the hilarious ""Tropic Thunder""). Sure hes cooked up a few good laughs and a couple of choke-you-up moments but just as many bits land on the floor with a thud. Another strike against it is Barry Sonnenfelds direction which is less than nimble in shifting tone between humorous and sentimental. The film is further hampered in the final stretch by the absence of the colorful Rick Baker-created alien critters that make the first half much better as well as a weak climax that goes for the drama over the action. Ive got nothing against genuine emotion -- even in a popcorn flick -- but when a films been building up for an alien showdown that duel better be good. This ones not.The premise relies on time travel an overused plot device usually carted out when inspiration has dried up like a tan-obsessed mom. Agent J (Smith) drops back into 1969 so he can stop evil alien Boris (Jemaine Clement) from changing history and slaying a younger version of Agent K the agent who put him behind bars of a lunar prison.Advertisement This back-to-the-past development happens about 30 minutes into the film spritzing the storyline with some freshness mostly thanks to production designer Bo Welch who has a heyday re-creating the rich time-period details. But an even bigger part of why this works is the presence of Josh Brolin as the more relaxed youthful Agent K. Brolin along with cohorts Smith and Jones elevates ""Black"" even when it slumps. As the less weathered more innocent K Brolin is comic perfection. His vocal inflections are uncannily similar to Jones yet hes not merely mimicking him. The versatile actor so good in ""Milk"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" adds subtle shading to his character that helps us understand why hes turned out the way he has.Smith who hasnt been on-screen nearly enough lately is as charming as ever and could teach a master class on the right way to play lead roles in big-budget movies. Jones receives limited screen time but does his deadpan most with what he has.Now for the bad news. The always welcome Emma Thompson is all but squandered as Agent O the new leader of the Men in Black enterprise. Shes not given much to do but yip like an alien -- a particularly awful moment.As the villain Clement (""Flight of the Conchords"") overenunciates to convey evilness but fails to reveal much more than an aptitude for snarly diction. And even though Michael Stuhlbarg (""Hugo"") tries his darndest hes saddled playing a soothsaying eccentric -- a role that seems tailor-made for Robin Williams. ""Men in Black 3"" is erratic like that -- sometimes fun sometimes not. Even with all that talent it never really gets sent into orbit.Men in Black 3   1/2Rating PG-13 Cast Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin Jemaine Clement Emma ThompsonDirector Barry SonnenfeldRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Men in Black III Fair Director Barry Sonnenfeld. Cast Will Smith Tommy Lee Jones Josh Brolin. Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action violence brief suggestive content and language. It sounds like good advice yet I cant help myself. I have to ask Why did they make this movie? The original released in 1997 was a terrifically fun sci-fi comedy with the laconic Tommy Lee Jones and the ebullient Will Smith teaming as agents of a secret organization that keeps Earth safe from bad aliens (and ensures the good ones stay safe as well). The confirmation that your weird grade-school teacher was from another planet alone made it worthwhile. Hotlist Best of Tommy Lee Jones Interview Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones The 2002 sequel ... not so much. So 10 years later was there a clamor for a third installment? If there was I missed it. The good news is that its better than the second ""Men in Black."" The bad news is not all that much. There are a couple of clever ideas a few funny moments a wealth of computer-generated special effects. But its hollow at its core and the asides have lost some of their spark. So Lady Gaga is an alien living on Earth? Duh. Agent J (Smith) and Agent K (Jones) are still partners still cleaning up alien messes still wiping witnesses memories clean so that the general population remains unaware of whats really going on. But J is growing tired of Ks silent act. A staleness has set in which seems like a dangerous path for director Barry Sonnenfeld to travel given the context. Bigger trouble is brewing. On a prison whose security is so maximum its located on the moon Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement from ""Flight of the Conchords"" unrecognizable) escapes in about as dumb a way as possible. He is a rather disgusting creature -- a deadly little spiderlike thing lives inside his hand and Boris shoots what seems to be an inexhaustible supply of dartlike weapons out of his hand as well (crowded in there). Boris has a score to settle with K who put him away 40 years ago and shot off his arm. Boris changes all that going back in time and killing the young K in 1969. Only J realizes this at first but eventually he convinces his new boss O (Emma Thompson of all people) that something is amiss. (A craving for chocolate milk is key which tells you the level of sophistication at work here.) So J has to travel back in time to the day before to prevent Boris from killing K because if he doesnt an alien invasion which has already begun will wipe out ... oh forget it. You get the idea. Its all an excuse to send J back to the 60s to set up the films best joke -- Josh Brolin playing the young Agent K. Brolin nails it. Its not just mimicry; his Agent K while still stone-faced and withdrawn is a little happier than the later model and it intrigues J. What happened to you to change you he asks several times? To which K replies good naturedly ""I dont know. It hasnt happened yet."" Aside from that joke Sonnenfeld also uses the premise to place the modern J in the 60s and presumably laugh at the results. A factory turns out to be THE Factory and Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) comes in for the MiB treatment (though not in ways you would expect). Michael Stuhlbarg is sweetly charming as an alien who can not only see the future but all possible versions of it. (""Its a pain in the ass"" he says of the gift.) Smith and Brolin have a decent chemistry and the final showdown between the agents and Boris while a little reckless and all over the place scores some points for incorporating the launch of Apollo 11. There is also an attempt at some emotional payoff though it throws the whole space-time continuum thing into question (I think; that stuff is always so hard to follow). ""Men in Black III"" isnt bad certainly not as bad as it might have been. But its not exactly good either. Mostly its something else unnecessary.

The first Men in Black (1997) wore its Tarantino-meets-Spielberg sunglasses proudly yet the concept was already feeling tired--and glibly out of sync with the new fear--by the time Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones saddled up for the much-reshot 2002 sequel. Apparently its okay to be nostalgic again especially when the emotional payoff is this big--a wonderful surprise. Men in Black 3 resuscitates not only Smiths lagging humor (his Carrey-esque rubber face returns in full force) and Joness crankiness but also the relatively lost virtues of clever cyclical time-travel scripting (a la Back to the Future) and a willingness to trust in an audiences grasp of basic history. After Agent K (Jones) is mysteriously wiped out of existence Agent J (Smith) must go back to 1969--the journey is a dazzling Chrysler Building leap through time falling past bankrupt Black Tuesday jumpers and WWII parade confetti--to reconnect with the younger version of his partner (Josh Brolin a fast study) in a racially tense America. Dont worry. The movie isnt a civics lesson. Were still talking gooey splatterings of lasered alien dripping from the ceiling plus a terrifically neurotic villain the bearded Boris the Animal courtesy of Conchord Jemaine Clement. You do sense though that the people behind MIB3 (mainly veteran producer Walter F. Parkes and script doctor David Koepp) were smart enough to let the audience grow up a bit enough to get the Andy Warhol jokes and one brilliantly weird creation a delicate alien who can see every outcome at once. Hes sort of like the screenwriter but also the hyperaware audience member; the acknowledgement is endearing.

A single scene? I saw both MIB movies upon their original release and have as little memory of the experience as if Id been mind-wiped with one of those ""neuralyzing"" flash sticks that Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones use to give amnesia to witnesses of supernormal incidents. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The modern science of the franchise depends though on the public having a short memory waiting for the moment when 02s ""I paid 7 for that?"" fades to indifference and then receptivity if not nostalgia. Hence Men in Black 3 which reunites the series stars with director Barry Sonnenfeld who beginning with 1991s The Addams Family made his fortune on special-effects comedies that could be synopsized and cross-promoted on the side of a 44-ounce fountain drink.If you opt to rent the 3-D glasses Men in Black 3 will be 14; the product has not otherwise changed significantly. Ten years later Agent J (Smith) and Agent K (Jones) have retained their affable younger black guy/tight-assed older white guy repartee. While J is nagging the emotionally constipated K to be more forthcoming about his past Boris ""The Animal"" (Jemaine Clement) an intergalactic hellion that K collared and crippled in 1969 is busy busting out of lunar prison. Boris is seeking not only revenge on K but also a complete do-over of the intervening 40 years during which his entire belligerent race was driven to extinction. Boris plans to effect this massive mulligan by traveling back in time to assassinate a young K. To prevent this J has to travel to 69 himself where he partners with a young K (Josh Brolin not young enough but doing a fair TLJ impersonation) and hustles against time to hunt down Boris.Is this the 80s or 2012? Its all quite Back to the Future down to the involvement of Steven Spielbergs Amblin Entertainment and a soundtrack theme song titled ""Back in Time"" with Miami rapper Pitbull replacing Huey Lewis and the News. The time-travel gimmick has at least the potential to be something more than a Hail Mary to save a tired property here though as there has always been a touch of retro-futurism about the MIB movies Joness starchy old-school Joe Friday-like formality the overtones of ""Great Society"" bureaucracy in the MIB Agency even the first films climax at the 64 Worlds Fair Unisphere with all of its dated Tomorrowland implications. Practically none of that comes to play in the third MIB. The new-old 60s gadgetry--gyroscopic motorcycles the jet packs we were promised primitive models of familiar MIB gear--is rendered in the familiar circa-1997 surgical-stainless-steel design template. As for the time-travel culture shock you get a few hippies with speaking roles and no significant engagement with the zeitgeist of the era. ""It wasnt the best time for your people"" J is warned as a black man traveling into the vicinity of the MLK assassination but aside from a light-comic profiling scene Martin Lawrences Black Knight had about as much to say on race relations as MIB3 does.In addition to saddling Boris with the limpest villain catchphrase in recorded history (""Lets agree to disagree"") the script by Etan Cohen and the inevitable small army of paid-by-the-one-liner punch-up men revisits the time-tested franchise gag in which public eccentrics (i.e. Dennis Rodman) are revealed to be hidden-in-plain-sight aliens. Here its Andy Warhol (Bill Hader) whos secretly an MIB agent; while in character Haders Warhol says things that Warhol would never conceivably say (""Nows not a good time. . . . This is a be-in."") and functions as a condescending stand-in for ""freaky"" 60s counterculture as a whole dismissed with a smug emperor-has-no-clothes twist.Despite such ubiquitous timidity one can pluck out a few pleasing distractions here. Special-effects man Rick Baker whose workshop was responsible for the previous MIB creatures puts together a colorful bestiary in a Chinese-restaurant shoot-out which also provides an opportunity for some good green-screen slapstick. The great Michael Stuhlbarg has a part as an extraterrestrial visitor who has the gift and curse of being at any given moment able to calculate the probability of every possible outcome of a situation in every single butterfly-effect chain of events leaving him a knot of elation and hypochondriac paranoia. Can even he conceive of a marketplace where the bland formula of MIB3 wont be rewarded?

Heres a case in point. Fifteen years since the jaunty original a decade since its diabolical cash-in sequel Men in Black 3 - is anyone really bothered? So its more of the same smartly designed slightly whimsical secret-agent alien-blasting nonsense this time in 3D. What does bring a smile to the face however is Will Smith back on screen after a four-year break not trying so hard to be serious or different and seemingly happy to gambol his way through some entertaining fluff. As for his black-suited cohort Tommy Lee Jones is now of pensionable age and looks like hes here on highly paid sufferance. So the movie comes up with a time-travel plot whereby Smith flits back to 1969 to save his cranky partner from a fate worse than death at the hands of visiting extraterrestrial psycho Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement). Oh and save the world while hes at it.Josh Brolin may be nobodys idea of a movie star but he gives a witty likeable and thought-through performance as the younger pre-grumpy Tommy Lee as we take a roundabout route to exploring the Smith amp; Jones chemistry that made the first movie more than just an effects extravaganza. Needless to say there are plenty of wibbly-wobbly aliens and theyre fine though you can also sense Sonnenfeld really working the 3D with lots of playful perspectives evidently conceived for the format. Not much for Emma Thompson to do as the agency boss but otherwise this freshens up the formula to amiable effect. Im still not convinced anyone really needs it but this is a respectable effort in the circumstances.

Its a look that the parents of recalcitrant teenagers know all too well that grimace that says ""You can make me go to this piano recital but you cant force me to look like Im enjoying myself."" We get some version of that face quite a bit from Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones in ""Men in Black 3"" a sequel that seems to indicate that a decade after their last onscreen outing these two stars are strictly here for the paycheck. Which is a pity since theres a zippy and clever movie going on all around the two lumps with their names above the title. Just like that piano recital however youll enjoy yourself more if youre paying attention to whats happening while ignoring the sourpuss in the corner. As alien-managing Agent J (Smith) gripes that he never has any meaningful conversations with his partner Agent K (Jones) Ks old nemesis Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement of ""Flight of the Conchords"") escapes from a maximum-security prison on the moon. Back in the 60s K shot off Boris arm and foiled an invasion attempt by Boris fellow Boglodites thereby dooming the warrior race to extinction. Boris decides to remedy the situation by jumping back in time and killing K and when that happens J is the only one who notices Ks absence and acknowledges the rift in the time stream. With the Boglodites set to invade Earth in this altered present J must jump back to 1969 himself to save the life of young K (Josh Brolin) and the world itself. Time-travel conundrums can give you a migraine if you think about them too hard (if Boris successfully kills K in 1969 why do the Boglodites wait until 2012 to invade?) but the script by Etan Cohen (""Tropic Thunder"" ""Idiocracy"") keeps things moving along briskly and doesnt get too mired down in the details. Moving the action to 1969 allows the film to play on several of its strengths not the least of which is getting Jones off screen and replacing him with Brolin who does a dead-on impersonation while also putting his own charming spin on the character. And since production designer Bo Welchs gleaming Men in Black headquarters has been ripped off all over the place (seen a Progressive Insurance commercial lately?) the time jump gives him the chance to recreate everything from the Apollo moon launch to Andy Warhols legendary Factory. The connection between the King of Pop Art and the Men in Black is one of the films best jokes thanks in no small part to Bill Haders hilarious cameo as Warhol. Generally speaking in fact the supporting cast runs the show here from Michael Stuhlbargs wide-eyed portrayal of an alien who can predict the parallel outcomes of multiple futures to Emma Thompsons all-too-brief appearance as higher-up Agent O. (One of the films greatest visual effects is the bubble-flip wig sported by Alice Eve as young O in 1969.) In addition to Welchs slick and seductive art direction we get more terrific aliens (of all shapes sizes and dispositions) from the legendary Rick Baker and the visual effects (supervised by Ken Ralston and Jay Redd) are dazzling but never overwhelming particularly in the films crisp 3D which feels immersive without being overly distracting. Its just too bad that Smith and Jones cant be part of the fun. Smith tries to recapture his wisecrackery of yore but its apparent that hed rather be brooding his way through another ""I Am Legend"" or ""Seven Pounds"" instead. (Why not just replace him with ""Saturday Night Live"" star Jay Pharoah who does a better Will Smith than Will Smith these days?) Jones meanwhile feels so distanced and distracted that its as though hed filmed his entire performance in front of a green screen at a remote location. Were supposed to find it ironic or something when J tells K ""Man Im getting too old for this. I can only imagine how you feel."" Take the note gentlemen. Or at least pretend like youre enjoying the recital. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Perhaps the best that can be said for the years-in-the-works ""Men in Black 3"" is that its prolonged difficult development rarely leaves visible scars on the finished product. This is no small compliment as subjecting the franchises zippy cornball energy to committee rethink and patchwork solutions could have been toxic and the sequel survives with the originals spirit largely intact. Pic does betray a few saggy sloppy edges and reigniting interest in the property may be a difficult task but overseas B.O. and franchise newcomer Josh Brolins quietly hilarious performance should give it a decent shot. There are a number of conflicting points to consider in assessing the pics commercial potential. In Will Smith it toplines one of the biggest movie stars on the planet albeit one who hasnt made a single film in four years. Moreover the film is part of a property that grossed more than 350 million at the U.S. box office alone yet 10 years have passed since the last installment -- the limp ""Men in Black II"" -- and its unclear just how strong the interest is for an encore. But thats all ultimately a problem for Sonys marketing department. For their parts director Barry Sonnenfeld and scripter Etan Cohen approach the material in a strangely low-key manner as though this were merely a midseason episode of a long-running series rather than a comeback after a decade away. This serves the movie well however as its clear the filmmakers arent simply expecting to coast on audience goodwill. Oddly enough the film seems to anticipate audience fatigue with its characters early on. After a prologue in which shotglass-eyed baddie Boris the Animal (""Flight of the Conchords"" Jermaine Clement) is broken out of a lunar prison Men in Black partners Agent J (Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) are seen back on Earth going through the motions of brokering peace among New York Citys undercover alien population and ""neuralyzing"" eyewitnesses with sub-Bondian one-liners. Jones is as laconic as always though even Smith seems notably dialed down this time with his bellows maintaining an inside-voice volume and his eyebrows rarely extending past half-arch. The conversational rhythms between the two partners have slowed and J begins to interrogate K about his continued reticence to open up to him even after 15 years of working together. The funereal mood then culminates in an actual funeral. Then just as one has begun to wonder where all this ennui and Oedipal anxiety is heading escaped alien Boris travels back in time to 1969 -- when the young Agent K initially foiled his evil scheme leading to Boris imprisonment -- and kills the intergalactic lawman with Agent J the only one who notices something is wrong in the present day. With Boris evil brethren now angling for planet-wide invasion J must travel back to the summer of 69 himself to protect his young partner (now played by Brolin) and put Boris down for good. Most time-travel plots reveal holes upon later reflection but this one is so openly nonsensical with its own rules so arbitrarily applied that scrutiny is a killjoy. This may rub some auds the wrong way though ""Men in Black 3"" is at its best when it simply owns its own absurdity. (At one point we learn that ruptures in the space-time continuum cause headaches which in turn produce a powerful craving for chocolate milk.) Now back in New York of the 60s Smiths J serves as the straight man for some expectedly groanable time-period gags though there are thankfully fewer of these than one might initially fear. (A trip to Andy Warhols Factory in search of aliens is too obvious by half though Bill Haders turn as Warhol goes a long way toward justifying it.) Fortunately J isnt stranded too long before running into Brolins young Agent K at which point the pic perks up noticeably. Brolin puts in a performance of almost eerie verisimilitude (indeed there are brief shots where one almost suspects Jones has served as Brolins stand-in) nailing Jones Texas drawl and granite facial tics while subtly suggesting a childlike spirit hidden beneath. The pic never overdoes the characters youthfulness of course; casting a 44-year-old thesp to play K at age 29 is one of its better in-jokes. Aside from Brolins K the pic introduces a delightfully Vonnegutian new character in Michael Stuhlbargs Griffin a weirdly adorable humanlike creature who can see all possible outcomes of any given scenario. (His description of the wild combination of variables that had to line up to allow the Miracle Mets victorious 69 season is the closest this series has ever veered toward poetry.) That this creature is forced to serve as conduit for the films undeservedly sappy ending may cut down his overall grade but he reps a nice addition nonetheless. As in the past editions Rick Bakers alien character designs and makeup remain a high point and an early shootout in a Chinese restaurant may be the sickest and stickiest sequence in the series history. Sonnenfeld endeavors to keep a light touch amid the serviceable 3D mayhem and aside from some weirdly dodgy effects work in seemingly straightforward shots -- a glimpse of the partners riding together in a car has the cutout roughness of an old ""Dragnet"" episode -- the big moments come off swimmingly. Time-traveling sequences and a climatic battle that takes notes from ""Casino Royales"" best setpiece are particularly well executed. In this age of blockbuster bloat Sonnenfelds willingness to wrap things up well before the two-hour mark as well as his eschewal of sledgehammer product placement count as gestures of considerable mercy.

Photo Tommy Lee Jones is only on-screen in ""MIB 3"" for about 15 minutes. ( ) Tommy Lee Jones is only on-screen in ""MIB 3"" for about 15 minutes. ( ) For a very belated obscenely expensive second sequel that perhaps nobody -- except accountants at drowning-in-red-ink Sony -- was clamoring for ""Men in Black 3"" is a reasonably crowd-pleasing and painless experience. Sure I might not feel so forgiving if Will Smiths massive two-story trailer were parked on my street in Manhattan during the films interminable production last year. But this only mildly bloated and convoluted action comedy has enough inspired moments to wipe out memories of the abysmal 2002 first sequel as surely as one of the black-suited heroes neuralyzer. PHOTOS MEN IN BLACK 3 FILMING IN NY Borrowing heavily from ""Back to the Future the new film finesses the second ones biggest problem -- Tommy Lee Jones very weary-looking Agent K -- by sending Smiths Agent J back in time to 1969 where he meets a 29-year-old version of Agent K (played in an uncanny impersonation by Josh Brolin). (Never mind that Brolin in real life is now 44 and that in 1969 Tommy Lee Jones was 22 rooming at Harvard with Al Gore and soon to make his film debut as Ryan ONeals roommate in ""Love Story""). This time tripping becomes necessary because Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) a very evil and scary-looking alien who Agent K apprehended in 1969 has escaped from a supermax prison on the moon. Boris himself has gone back to 1969 to kill K -- before the latter destroys his arm captures him and installs a security shield to protect Earth from an invasion from Boris world. For reasons that arent made terribly clear J is now the only person on Earth who doesnt believe that K was killed in 1969 -- except possibly Agent O (Emma Thompson) the new head of the Men in Black service after the off-screen demise (presumably of natural causes) of Rip Torns Agent Zed. After a breathtaking leap from the Chrysler Building into 1969 J is stopped by the cops for ""driving while black"" and briefly taken into custody by the younger notably less crotchety K (who amusingly carries the inevitable brick-size cellphone a decade or two before it was invented as well as a battery belt for his outsize nebulizer). The agents finally team up for a raid on Andy Warhols Factory -- the movies best sequence -- where they encounter the movies most delightful character an alien named Griff (marvelously played by Michael Stuhlbarg) who can see infinite multiple versions of future events (like the Mets improbably winning the World Series). The films climax takes place at Cape Canaveral (actually known as Cape Kennedy at the time) where J and K need to place the Earth-security device on Apollo 11 before it takes off for the first landing on the moon. An attempt at pathos -- even the dimmest audience member will guess the identity of a black military officer who turns up in an attempt to explain Ks grouchy future mien -- doesnt quite fly and it seems almost perverse not to utilize the considerable comic chops of Clement (""Flight of the Conchords""). Director Barry Sonnenfeld back for his third ""MIB keeps things moving agreeably and Rick Baker contributes some wonderfully squirmy-looking extraterrestrials especially for a hilarious raid on a Chinese restaurant that contains most of Jones perhaps 15 minutes worth of footage. ""Men in Black 3"" at one point reveals that Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber are extraterrestrials -- a throwaway joke that even the filmmakers seem to realize has whiskers after 15 years.

Daily Edition Login to download Men in Black 3 Film Review 917 PM PDT 5/21/2012 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Columbia Pictures A decade after Part Two the MiB franchise recovers the originals magic TWITTER Finding smart ways to bring novelty to the franchise without forsaking what made the original so much fun (and in fact doubling down on some of those qualities) Barry Sonnenfelds Men in Black 3 easily erases the second installments vague but unpleasant memory and -- though we might hope producers will quit while theyre ahead -- paves the way for future installments. Its hard to imagine it wont be a hit and hard to begrudge that success no matter how saturated we are with comic-book properties and sequels. The script credited solely to Etan Cohen despite many rumored contributors finds a way to give Will Smith the lions share of screen time while involving us more emotionally in the character of Tommy Lee Jones Agent K. After a time-traveling villain kills K in 1969 Smiths Agent J must travel back to prevent the murder -- where he discovers a youthful less stony K (Josh Brolin easily conjuring Jones Texas deadpan) and cant stop wondering what happened to sap the mans joie de vivre. The movie deploys most of its creepy-crawly ETs in the first act with baddie ""Boris the Animal"" chief among them. Flight of the Conchords co-star Jemaine Clement goes full-tilt ferocious in the role leaving fans to add their own ironic comedy to his performance (and to imagine him laughing at a repeated catchphrase we assume is intentionally horrible) while he works to live up to Rick Bakers genuinely disgusting design for the character. Boris who often sprouts mouthlike body cavities and has a symbiotic relationship with a projectile-spitting insect breaks free from a moon-based prison in a high-energy opening scene. He makes his way to Manhattan then time-travels to kill the man who once blew off his arm while foiling his plans to conquer Earth for the Boglodite species. The film lingers just long enough in the present to introduce a replacement for Rip Torns MiB-chief Zed Agent O (Emma Thompson) who evidently has history with Agent K. Then it sends Smith back using a time-travel method that makes little sense -- for some reason plummeting from the Chrysler Building is required -- but is a lot of fun to watch. The pic moves briskly once back in the 60s having a bit of fun envisioning a lower-tech version of Men in Black gear and working in pop-culture details (a nice gag involves Andy Warhol) without slowing the action a bit. The filmmakers find a convenient resolution for all chrono-conflict confusion in the person of Griffin (Michael Stuhlbarg) an alien whos able to see all possible futures simultaneously. With Griffin as their oracle J and K eventually wind up at Cape Canaveral for climactic action involving the launch of the first moon mission. Although some plot twists are easy to spot theyre no less satisfying for being telegraphed. 3D is as irrelevant as ever here but fortunately the gimmick does nothing to dim the jewel tones of Bill Popes appealing cinematography. Other production elements like Danny Elfmans score continue the winning look and feel established in the first film.
