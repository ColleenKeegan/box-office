Director Michael MooreGenre DocumentaryRunning Time 113 minutes (requires RealPlayer) Related NPR Stories Sizing Up Sicko Mondello and Silberner Rate Film as Entertainment and Expose June 23 2007 When he took on the gun lobby in Bowling for Columbine and George W. Bush in Fahrenheit 9/11 firebrand documentarian Michael Moore could reasonably be said to be courting controversy even if there sometimes seemed to be more sizzle than steak in his arguments. But when he suggests that health-care costs are out of control in this country its hard to imagine anyone wanting to argue with him apart from maybe a few pharmaceutical-company lobbyists. The point hes making -- with his usual humor and force -- is that most other developed nations have some form of universal health care so their citizens arent troubled by the costs of medical emergencies. In a funny hospital sequence British patients are visibly startled at the very mention of money in the same breath as medicine whereas even Americans with decent health insurance are likely to worry about what a visit to the doctor will cost. Moores tactics are as provocative as always -- a trip to Guantanamo for instance to demand that three ailing Ground Zero rescue workers get the same free health care the U.S. government affords suspected terrorists. Theres plenty of grandstanding most of it very funny. And in this instance all that sizzle is selling the steak.

From the title on Sicko is outspoken in its dismay that a country as rich and powerful as the United States should force so many of its citizens to gamble on the odds of sustained good health. But dismay in this case is healthy. With considerably less personal bombast than he laid on in Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore first shows how the profit-driven health-insurance industry got this way. Then he introduces various Americans who have suffered as a result of business as usual. And then he looks at how a few other countries have (in his never-mistaken-for-humble opinion) done health care better England France Canada and yes Cuba. Moores doofus persona as an American abroad wears thin -- a man who wins awards at Cannes can no longer pass as a rube. And the Cuban escapade designed to provoke backfires when he loses focus by including Cuban firefighters in an homage to 9/11 first responders. But the questions Moore leaves viewers with are important nonpartisan ones. If other countries can provide their people with universal health care why cant we? If we cant who are we?

This cant be stressed too much. For if anyone in these isles mistook Moores new film for a balanced erudite essay on the American healthcare system  they could rightly accuse Moore of distortion self-aggrandisement emotional blackmail and all the other qualities that weve come to know - and love - from Moores particular brand of filmmaking. As it is you suspect that Sicko has all these elements in droves yet still youre glad that the film exists and may even find yourself cheering or shedding a tear at its more demagogic moments. Its only later when you emerge into the light that you find yourself hurriedly adjusting your trousers and a small amount of guilt starts to flow.Sicko is a quieter more focused and less feral beast than its predecessor Fahrenheit 9/11 but thats not saying much. Moore takes 50 minutes to lumber into view which on a first viewing of the film I took for a new modesty. Most probably though Moores early absence - the voiceover is very much his own - is for other reasons; he must find it more difficult to film in public these days.One also wonders has he come to depend more heavily now on other interviewers and researchers than his own legwork? Whatever the methods the point of the film is a strong one well-made the profit-motive of American health insurance is killing people. Moore sidesteps the issue of millions of Americans not even being able to afford proper insurance and instead fires unease straight into the heart of employed financially comfortable secure middle-America. Moore presents case after case of those who have suffered from insurance companies finding ways to wriggle out of the deal. Hes good on the underlying values of the system too offering an amusing episode in which he traces the roots of the reds-under-the-bed fears against socialised medicine even tracking down a 12-inch record that Ronald Reagan made to help the cause.Its when Moore crosses the pond and starts to compare the American situation with the perceived Nirvana of the British and French systems that any European viewer will have to start biting their tongue and chanting this is meant for less-intelligent Americans less-intelligent Americans less-intelligent Americans . . . for whom the entire concept of free healthcare was always demonised as a Soviet method of mind-control. Of course as we know our NHS has its own problems but theyre not Moores concern why ruin a good rant? Mostly Moore keeps to his simple but important task of comparing the benefits of government-run healthcare with that operated by private enterprise and destroying some popular myths about socialised medicine. The films worst chapters come at the end with two very stupid stunts one involving a trip to Cuba and another involving Moore footing the medical bill for the wife of a vocal critic.So familiar now is Moores heavy-handed style of persuasion that when a film called Manufacturing Dissent arrived in our cinemas last week and accused him of distorting one of the central thrusts of Roger amp; Me his film about unemployment in Flint most critics were willing to shrug their shoulders with a resounding Aw shucks. We shouldnt be so complacent a good cause doesnt justify iffy means. Yet you would have to be very naive to watch Moores films this one included (which is less obviously wild and hysterical) and not see through his methods. In fact thats part of the pleasure; a groan here a heartfelt nod there. And for us Brits at least Sicko is worth it just for the sight of Moore wandering around Hammersmith Hospital looking for the cash till.

"Prescription for trouble | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsPrescription for troubleLike the kid who chops his fathers prize roses to give his mother a bouquet Michael Moore delivers his films with dirty hands.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 29 2007 Sicko (out of 4) A probe of Americas health-care system. Written and directed by Michael Moore. At major theatres. 113 minutes. PG Like the kid who chops his fathers prize roses to give his mother a bouquet Michael Moore delivers his films with dirty hands.He sparks valuable debate about such serious issues as gun abuse politicized terror and corporate chicanery yet he does so with little regard to factual accuracy or even simple fairness. He is a crusader without conscience.His latest work Sicko a probe into American health care is occasionally enlightening frequently amusing and constantly engaging. Viewed strictly as satire which is how all his films should be seen it does a good job of mocking a system thats clearly in need of an overhaul.Sicko is also completely lacking in journalistic rigour presenting only the negatives of for-profit U.S. health care and only the positives of the government-run Canadian British French and Cuban Medicare programs. As always Moore makes unsupported assertions and uses out-of-context edits. The film is not a documentary if that term is to mean anything more than unvarnished propaganda.Moores many apologists including journalists who should know better give him a free pass under the ""greater good"" argument. Who cares if hes careless about the details or ruthless about his accusations? Hes got a good heart And hes funnyThese same apologists dont extend such courtesies to Moores chief nemesis President George W. Bush whom the filmmaker manages to present as both the dumbest man on the planet and a diabolical schemer. When Bush and his cronies fudge on the facts it can only be due to the vilest of motives.A hilarious Bush malapropism opens Sicko but this time the U.S. president isnt the focus of Moores animus as he was in the terror satire Fahrenheit 9/11. The millionaire filmmaker is out to expose the ""powerful forces"" of American health insurers and their political allies whom he charges exploit pain for profit. (They include Sen. Hillary Clinton Medicare lion turned HMO tame tabby one of the few non-Republicans whom Moore skewers.)As violins wail on the soundtrack and Moores hushed voice drips sympathy we gape in horror at travesties of corporate medicine. A bankrupt Denver couple drained of their life savings by hospital bills is forced to move into a daughters home. A car-accident victim having been knocked unconscious is refused compensation for an ambulance because she thoughtlessly neglected to get advance approval for the ride. A man with a severed finger chooses to lose the digit rather than pay the 60000 it would cost to have it sewn back on.These and many other sad and shocking stories are contrasted with scenes of the enlightened Utopias in other countries where Medicare is ""free"" - if you ignore the fact as Moore does that high taxes and long wait times pay for that ""free"" care. He once again presents Canadians as the cheery hobbits of North America who live happily in the shire and look with fear upon the dark place below. Moore manages to find Canadians including members of his extended family who wait mere minutes for hospital treatments and surgeries with no costs and few cares.These would presumably be the same jolly Canucks he presented in Bowling for Columbine who dont lock their front doors because there are no gun nuts north of the 49th parallel.Moore goes golfing with an affluent Canadian who speaks movingly about Medicare and its founder Tommy Douglas. When a disingenuous Moore asks why wealthier taxpayers should pay for their poorer fellow citizens to be healthy the golfer replies ""Somebody has to look after them."" The man then reveals himself to be a Conservative voter. Uncork the champagne in OttawaElsewhere on Moores tour of compassion he introduces us to a British doctor who can afford a 1 million home and an Audi on his Medicare salary and French patients who are given free vacations and home-helpers thanks to government largesse.Moore saves the biggest revelation for last. Rounding up several 9/11 rescue workers who claim to have been abandoned by their American health-care providers he attempts to gatecrash the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Moore reasons that if the terrorist suspects imprisoned there can get free medical care then so should the heroic warriors of 9/11.When they are turned away - although we never actually see that - they throw themselves upon the mercy of Cuban authorities who are only too happy to provide the 9/11 workers with ""free"" health care courtesy of the comrades. Moore interviews the pediatrician daughter of late Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara who tells us that communism is better than capitalism.Gosh who could argue with such impartial counsel? Maybe the many Cubans who each year try to flee the island to become American citizens? Such things as usual dont trouble Moore. Nor does it seem to occur to him that if Guantanamo were to deny health care to its prisoners the U.S. would be in violation of international law and basic human rights.And yet for all that Sicko is still worth seeing - as long as the big grain of salt needed for it is put on more than just the popcorn. Moore doesnt have anything good to say about American health care and too much good to say about other systems but hes once again poking a necessary stick into a rotting beehive. Just keep him away from your rose bushes.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 29 2007 129 PM Sick Joke Michael Moore gathers our rage at Americas health-care system. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Sicko click the arrow button on the player below You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Michael Moore Even those viewers who are ideologically in sync with Michael Moore can find plenty to critique in his methods the gimmicks the deck-stacking the deliberate neglect of opposing points of view. On the other hand even Moores worst ideological enemies would be hard put to dispute the basic argument of his new film Sicko (Weinstein Co.) The American health-care system is a sick joke and has been for a very long time. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. We dont need Michael Moore to tell us this of course. We get the clue from the ruinous medical bills that arrive in our mailbox from our friends gruesome stories of conditions untreated and claims denied and even from the mouths of our own doctors. (My GP never misses an opportunity to grouse about the insanity of the insurance labyrinth.) The prize anecdote in our household was when before having a child I called my private health insurer to ask about a ""family plan""  Hows this for a family plan an Oxford rep told me scarcely bothering to conceal her amusement. Your baby can be covered at the same full-price premium youre paying now in essence doubling your rates. The people in Moores documentary many of whom he found after soliciting their stories on his Web site tell tales that follow that same Lewis Carroll logic to far darker places. Advertisement After offering some brief glimpses of the hell inhabited by those with no health coverage at all--the film opens on a guy stitching up his own slashed knee then visits a man who had to choose which finger he could afford to keep after a table-saw accident--Moore states that this isnt a movie about them or their nearly 50 million uninsured compatriots. Instead hes chosen to focus on Americans who have insurance and find themselves screwed up the yin-yang anyway. This is a wise choice from a rhetorical point of view because by exploring the dilemmas faced by those who have shoveled out premiums for decades Moore can show that our status quo doesnt just have a few soft spots--its rotten to the core. To give away too much about these peoples stories would undermine one of the films great strengths the quiet dignity with which the subjects tell their tales themselves. Babies dying on the ride between the nearest hospital and the nearest in-network alternative. Spouses dying of cancer because the HMO deemed lifesaving procedures too ""experimental"" to try. (Isnt that the whole point of being experimental?) Moore listens to these stories without undue editorializing--for all his bullying of those in power (and occasionally the audience) hes a soft touch as an interviewer. In one of the movies best segments insurance-industry insiders frankly admit that their profession is rapacious. A former medical director for an HMO testifying before Congress delivers a scathing rebuke both of the insurance industry and of her own role in denying patients care. Another whistle-blower describes the industrys tactics with stark clarity ""Youre not slipping through the cracks. Somebody made that crack and swept you toward it."" A woman who does customer service for a major insurer weeps as she recalls denying sick customers coverage then adds ""Thats why Im such a bitch on the phone to people. ... I just cant take the stress."" The lighter second half of the film takes us on a three-country tour of free universal health care. Moore dashes around Canada Britain and France collecting anecdotal data about the superiority of those countrys systems--and even if his methods are thoroughly unscientific its hard not to swoon with envy at the French  SOS Medecins system with doctors whisking from house call to house call in jaunty white cars. In a London hospital Moore wanders around looking for the billing department in vain. All this is packaged with the usual Michael Moore jollity interspersed with vintage clips from a Soviet-era musical about wheat-threshing and a 50s-era LP recorded by Ronald Reagan about the dangers of socialized medicine. Its during the movies finale when Moore takes a boatful of sick Americans to Guantanamo Bay in search of free health care when the deck gets stacked high enough to wobble a little. I dont begrudge him the prank or the visual gag of shouting ""Can we get some medical care?"" through a megaphone--I confess to being a sucker for this kind David-and-Goliath political theater. But when Moore gives up on the prison and herds his flock including three ailing 9/11 rescue workers through the streets of Havana his tone becomes almost reverent. An old Irving Berlin tune about the wonders of this tropical island paradise plays on the soundtrack--ostensibly ironically but Moore seems to take it at face value. The scenes in a Cuban hospital where the sick Americans tearfully thank their kind caregivers are the only ones in the film that feel staged. I wish Moore could realize that he doesnt need to disavow dissenting ideas in order to build his (essentially airtight) case. This folksy tour of the health-care crisis brings to mind the saying of another American populist Mark Twain ""Everyone complains about the weather but no one does anything about it."" In a democracy of course complaining about something is doing something about it as long as some of that griping is done at the polling booth. In that spirit Sicko is less a documentary than a clearinghouse of rage. Though it has its share of voice-over exposition and comic stock footage the films real purpose is to aggregate individual health-care horror stories into a portrait of the profit-driven and (literally) inhospitable place our country has become.

Photo Caption Michael Moore explores Americas health care system in his documentary SICKO. Photo by TWC 2007. Photo TWC 2007 Need a doctor? Thats too bad. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Sicko Documentary. Starring written and directed by Michael Moore. (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Michael Moore does something very shrewd in ""Sicko"" his new documentary about the health care crisis in America. He doesnt address his film to the 50 million Americans who dont have health care but to the 250 million who do. And he makes the case that things need to change not by appealing to sympathy or to common decency but to self-interest. He tells people who have health insurance that even if they think theyre safe theyre not -- and he shows them why. ""Sicko"" will scare people and it probably should. Moore makes two arguments in this documentary one thats entirely persuasive and another thats at least intriguing. The first is that health care in America is in a state of escalating crisis -- that people are getting swindled and people are dying. Moore documents a corrupt and scandalous situation in which doctors and health care gatekeepers get rewarded for denying coverage and the HMOs rack up profits in the billions -- which they then use to buy off politicians. If what Moore is saying is true if health care companies really are making billions by deliberately defrauding customers and letting them die then were witnessing the moral equivalent of war profiteering or perhaps war crimes. Having made the case that our system isnt working Moore launches his second argument that what we need in this country is what France England and Canada already have a single-payer system. He then proceeds to present the national health systems in these countries as nothing short of idyllic with short waits in emergency rooms house calls (in France) happy doctors and expert care. Its here that I wish Moore would have striven for more balance not because hes obligated to be fair but because a balanced approach might have been more informative and persuasive. For example in his French English and Canadian interviews he never asks the one key question What are you paying in taxes? Yet theres no mistaking the pride these people have in their system not just because of what it does for them but for what it says about them and their culture. Indeed even if Moore is guilty of propagandizing he shows enough for us to realize that weve been on the receiving end of propaganda for years without knowing it -- that ""socialized medicine"" is a nightmare that doctors are so poorly paid that theres no incentive to enter the profession that people dont get to choose their own doctor and that governments to save money let serious illness go untreated. Moore does a good job of knocking down those arguments and demonstrates how if anything that state of affairs actually exists more and more under our system. A woman relives the nightmare of having her daughter turned away for emergency treatment at a hospital because her plan covered only treatment at another hospital. The child died on the way. He interviews a young woman denied treatment for cervical cancer because her plan considered her too young to get cervical cancer. Promising treatments are denied desperately ill patients on the basis of being ""experimental."" One of the patients Moore interviewed has since died and another woman who appears to be in her mid-20s has seen her cancer metastasize. But these are just isolated incidents arent they? Apparently not. A health care company screener breaks down in tears talking about the system by which she is forced to refuse care and a former investigator for an HMO discusses the ways in which his department looked for excuses not to pay legitimate claims. ""Youre not slipping through the cracks"" he says. ""Someone made that crack and is sweeping you toward it."" Moore may be an imp a manipulator and a provocateur but he keeps his vaudevillian antics to a minimum and to the extent theyre there theyre welcome They provide enough diversion grim laughter and gallows humor to make this dispiriting topic bearable. ""Sicko"" is enraging alarming and terribly sad but Moore takes care that its never anything less than fascinating a series of compulsively watchable stories and incidents interspersed with masterfully edited sequences. Some might prefer other Moore films for their subject matter. But in terms of pure storytelling and filmmaking this is his most accomplished work. In a jaw-dropping prank Moore takes Sept. 11 rescue workers -- denied coverage for respiratory ailments contracted while pulling bodies from the rubble -- and brings them to Cuba for medical treatment. He captains a small flotilla of ships to Guantanamo Bay so that these Americans can get the health care that the terrorists and alleged terrorists are getting and when that doesnt work he just takes them to a Cuban hospital. Its Moore at his best. He contrives situations but then real things happen. In the process Moore rescues 9/11 from its heinous use as a stealth weapon for the teardown of American values and uses it in the interest of restoring true American values like ""looking out for the other guy"" as James Stewart once said in an old Capra film. No one should consider ""Sicko"" the last word on the health care issue but it just might spark the demand for a genuine honest discussion. -- Advisory Some mildly disturbing hospital footage and adult subject matter.

His newest polemic ""Sicko"" takes aim at our disastrous health-care system at a moment in the national debate when even the die-hardest boosters of free enterprise acknowledge that major changes have to be made if not the free universal health care that most Western countries offer and that we resist.The ""we"" as Moore takes pains to show us are the drug companies the hospital industry the bought-and-paid-for politicians and the health-insurance companies the latter being the true focus of this alternately hilarious and heartbreaking screed. This time around Moore spares us the spectacle of himself storming the offices of his villains his camera ever ready to capture their clench-jawed embarrassment. Hes more concerned with the victims--not the 50 million uninsured but the much vaster numbers who have private health insurance and suffer for it. We see their harrowing personal stories the couple who have to sell their home to pay their medical bills; the woman who had to be rushed to a hospital in an ambulance who is then told--with a logic worthy of Kafka or Groucho Marx--that she cant be reimbursed for the ride because it wasnt pre-approved; the woman who lost her husband to cancer because her insurer deemed the surgery he needed as ""experimental."" And on and on in one pungent vignette after another.Moore traces the origins of this mess back to a 1971 meeting--astonishingly caught on tape--in Richard Nixons White House at which the president expressed his approval of Edgar Kaisers proposal to maximize profit by offering less care. Driving home the modus operandi of the insurance industry is the angry guilt-ridden congressional testimony of a former Humana Corp. medical director who lays out ""the dirty work of managed care"" which rewards its employees for saving the company money not for helping its patients. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Is ""Sicko"" one-sided? You bet. The globe-trotting Moore compares our broken system with the free health care offered by Canada France England and--in what has already become his most controversial flourish--Cuba where he takes a group of 9/11 rescue workers for help they cant get at home. Because he paints in broad simple strokes his overly rapturous depictions of these systems are bound to raise skeptical eyebrows. (Its not hard to find horror stories in any country.) And even though you can easily imagine the Cubans licking their chops at the PR opportunity Moore affords them who could not be moved by the tribute the Havana firefighters pay to the American rescue workers who have come to their land for treatment?The opponents of free health care love to raise the ominous specter of ""socialized medicine."" Why Moore asks in a very funny montage that turns a Soviet musical propaganda movie on its head do we readily accept free schools libraries police officers and firemen but blanch at the idea of free medical service? Adopting his faux-naif aw-shucks persona (still effective if getting harder and harder to swallow) Moore just as he did in ""Roger and Me"" asks us to contemplate the dark side of the profit system. And the thesis that ran through ""Fahrenheit 9/11""--that the powers that be use fear and intimidation to keep us docile and compliant--informs every frame of his movie. The difference between France and the United States one observer provocatively suggests is that in France the government is afraid of the people and here the people are afraid of the government.It will be fascinating to watch Moores enemies have a go at ""Sicko."" Certainly he leaves himself open to criticism. To make his point that the French dont have to be overtaxed to pay for their government-paid health service he shows us the comfortable lifestyle of one happy French bourgeois couple. This does not exactly qualify as a rigorous argument. But if Moore can be irritating hes also indispensable. I think this time around a lot of people who dont cotton to the filmmakers politics are going to find themselves lining up on his side. The simplicity of ""Sickos"" argument is also its power. It asks us as Americans a few basic but haunting questions Who are we? What have we become? The follow-up question is left unstated What are we going to do about it? Lets hope ""Sicko"" helps us come up with the right answer.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Michael Moore investigates the American healthcare system in Sicko. Photo Courtesy Photo Sicko (re-release) 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Judging by its title Sicko might be mistaken for a slasher flick and the assumption is not far off the mark. Not because of violence. Not because of gore. But because it is in some ways a horror film. Among its victims Rick who sawed off two fingertips but could only afford to reattach one -- for 12000. Carole who couldnt pay her hospital bills and was dumped at a homeless shelter in her flapping white gown. Tracy who was denied coverage for a bone-marrow transplant and died weeks later of kidney cancer. Michael Moores latest documentary-as-soapbox-vituperation is a damning touching darkly comical expose on the United States health-care system. It is also a deeply impassioned appeal for change. Moore haters like to dismiss the man as a whack job and a lying partisan crank but hes really an idealist. Look past the omnipresent ball cap and slumping gait and youll find a patriot -- a true believer in the American dream. When he says ""We live in a world of We not Me "" hes not being the least bit campy. He has for a moment no sense of irony whatsoever. He believes this stuff. As he did to the American gun culture in Bowling for Columbine and the Bush administration in Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore uses Sicko to assail the insurance industry and pharmaceutical companies and the politicians who accept their contributions. Bush gets slapped around some but so do Hillary Rodham Clinton -- once reviled by the industry for trying to establish universal health care -- and former Louisiana congressman Billy Tauzin who pushed for the Medicare prescription bill before leaving to head the drug-company trade group PhRMA. As usual Moore assembles his argument from poignant anecdotes and factoid-driven diatribes that use graphics music and archival material to make his point. Just listen to that fuzzy audio of Nixon and Ehrlichman discussing Kaiser Permanente. But we also get lots of winking video footage (I especially liked the old Soviet agitprop) and choice music clips that run from the Khachaturian Saber Dance to a French rendition of Feelin Groovy. With Sicko Moore himself doesnt pop on-screen until some 40 minutes in a shrewd move for a filmmaker who understands his role as cultural irritant. People who hate him might continue to hate him. They might call Sicko an overly theatrical sucker-punching screed that paints France as paradise Canadians as smiling (but we knew that) Britain as maddeningly reasonable and Cuba as a cure for what ails us. But its a fiercely effective call to arms -- a film that persuades and shames and chills. And he asks why a group of ill 9/11 emergency workers volunteers not on the New York City payroll couldnt find affordable health care until he took them to Havana. You could dismiss it as a stunt this trip to Cuba. You could point out the countrys problems or the movies cherry-picked health statistics. But nothing so illustrates Moores rumpled brand of optimism as those few minutes near the end of Sicko when Cuban firefighters stand at attention to honor their ailing American brethren. Its as uplifting and heart-rending a thing as you will see at the movies all year. And it speaks of Moores enduring faith -- his angry nettled exasperated belief that ""despite all our differences we sink or swim together."" amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Banana Republic Extra 50% off sale items + free shipping w/ 50 Mainstays Sheridan Rug for 7 + pickup at Walmart PUMA Mens Tazon 6 Ripstop Sneakers for 40 + free shipping Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

""Sicko"" his latest feature- film commentary is the fruit of those epiphanies. Mildly rabble-rousing and oh-so-comfy in its observations ""Sicko"" is far from zeitgeist-altering. Its funny and mildly informative. But if youre hoping for a documentary that could nudge in a sea change in our health care system well its no ""An Inconvenient Truth."" Moore could have made a tragedy. Or he could have taken the artistically risky leap and made the fiction-comedy he hankered to create. Instead ""Sicko"" is a teaspoonful of documentary sugar in a summer of popcorn salt. Thats not a bad thing really. Only we could use stronger medicine. Moore likely knows we citizens need a bitter pill about our own sorry habits. Its just hard to write out that prescription and put fannies in the theater. Send me your health care insurance tales a post on Moores website read in early 2006. OK Moores shout-out led the witnesses more than that ""If you have been abused in any way by this sick greedy grubby system and it has caused you and your loved ones great sorrow and pain let me know."" Donna Smith answered the call. A former newspaper columnist who battled cancer she moved to the Denver area to live with her daughter when she and her husband were forced to sell their home to pay off medical debts. The couple and other patients whose coverage left them painfully exposed are featured alongside doctors and patients in nationalized health care programs abroad as well as a number of former HMO employees who are as frustrated as the patients. The latter perform acts of onscreen contrition. A doctor turned administrator turned whistle-blower speaks to a congressional committee about the leaps her salary took as she became good at rejecting claims. Dont think of it as ""denying care"" she was coached. Think of it as ""denying payment."" Moores examination of the health care insurance biz is often amusing. During a visit to a London hospital all the interviewees seem flummoxed by Moores questions about payment. An immigrant couple with their newborn an admitting administrator even a cashier politely hear him out before chuckling. Being a Moore production it also provokes. During a trip with a group of ailing 9/11 first responders to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay the director stands on a ship bullhorn in hand requesting access to the base for the quality medical treatment Guantanamos ""enemy combatants"" are allegedly receiving. Its pure Moore. Its also less than the media hullabaloo made it out to be. In an effort to show how more enlightened countries take care of their citizens the filmmaker takes his crew and his mildly hayseed shtick to Canada England and France where nationalized health care exists. The journeys are interesting even moving. Yet they feel to often like a comparing of apples and oranges. A trip across the border to Canada doesnt unearth any naysayers. He does interview his charming aunt and uncle. For a homegrown critique of class and care north of the border rent ""The Barbarian Invasions"" winner for the Best Foreign Language Oscar in 2003. In Paris Moore rides shotgun with a doctor making housecalls for emergencies and not-quite emergencies. The fun scenes raise one question ""Whats a housecall Mommy?"" And Flint Mich.s famous son is rightly tickled upon hearing the French government sends caretakers to help women whove recently given birth. They do chores like dinner and laundry. What wrinkles are in store for that system given Frances recent election of a president who promises American-style reforms? ""Sicko"" kicks off with a couple of galling tales of the uninsured. (Actually the movie opens with a clip of our president flubbing a comment.) Half an hour into the movie youd be right to wonder why President Bush was there. But teasing the unintentional comedy of George W. has become one of the tics of Moores trade though hes cut down some on the partisan barbs and sniping. Hillary Clinton gets her due for trying to make universal health care a reality in the early days of Bill Clintons administration. Then Moore takes aim at the presidential hopeful for making nice with the medical-industry lobby. Its taken a long time and plenty of repeat viewings to make peace with the sort of filmmaker Michael Moore is. The maker of ""Bowling for Columbine"" and ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is not really a documentarian. Hes cinemas first columnist.

Sicko Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2007) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/sicko-2007,200,sicko13,sicko,rogerebert
"Moore at his feverish best in hilarious sobering Sicko - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Moore at his feverish best in hilarious sobering Sicko By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 29 2007 Man of the people or America s very own Great Satan? Wherever you stand you have to admit Michael Moore has a gift for making a point.Perhaps thats understating the matter. When the celebrated (and reviled) filmmaker pulls up in a fishing boat outside the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay and announces via bullhorn ""I have three 9/11 rescue workers They just want medical attention The same youre giving Al-Qaeda "" we are witnessing a master gadfly at the top of his game. Whether we cant breathe because were laughing too hard or because we feel like weve been punched in the gut is moot.""Sicko"" is Moores best most focused movie to date -- much more persuasive than the enraged and self-righteous ""Fahrenheit 9/11 "" -- and not just because the director turns the dial down on his own faux-folksy persona. Moore has a thesis he can get his arms around this time. Resolved The US health-care system is a disaster built to punish the sick and enrich corporations. Other countries do it better -- a lot better. Why is that and how do we change? Its only on the last point that Moore falters.Go ahead feel smug; you live in Massachusetts where affordable universal insurance becomes law on Sunday. ""Sicko"" unleashes its scorn not just on insurance companies but on HMOs Big Pharma and the politicians they own. The movie builds its case from the ground up with anecdotes of average Americans so cruelly abused by the system the only response is the laughter of disbelief.One man lost two fingers to a tablesaw then was told by doctors he could afford to have only one re attached so would he prefer the middle or ring finger? A woman was denied the cost of post-car-crash EMS care because it hadnt been pre-approved. Another woman was told she must give back the money that paid for her operation because she hadnt disclosed a pre-existing condition a yeast infection years earlier.Those are the more grimly entertaining stories. Others just make you want to cry and for once you dont feel Moore is exploiting other peoples tragedies (any more than they want him to at least). Some people were willing to use the director right back; theres a tart little segment about a father desperate to get a second cochlear implant for his baby girl (the insurance company would only pay for one) who drops Moores name in a phone message to the claims department. Bingo -- the implant is approved.""Sicko"" features interviews with former insurance company employees who describe quotas for claims denials and bonuses for anything above quota -- the system appears rigged specifically to not provide help to those who need it. Moore talks to a doctor whose signature is on a series of denials to a woman suffering from a brain tumor; it turns out the signatures are stamped without the doctor ever reading the claims. How did we get here? ""Sicko"" reaches back to the Nixon administration for a fascinating secret-tapes conversation in which aide John Ehrlichman urges the president to get behind Kaiser Permanentes HMO approach to health care. (The next day Nixon announced the HMO Act of 1973. ) Moore also brings up Hillary Clintons doomed attempt to pass a universal health-care bill the way you might discuss an ex who stood you up; he acidly notes Senator Clinton is now the second-largest recipient of contributions from health-care corporations.The films bitterly funny activist vaudeville truly begins when Moore travels abroad to see how different nations take care of their sick and injured beginning with a woman who sneaks over the border to Canada for health care. ""Were Americans"" he deadpans. ""We go into other countries when we need to. Its tricky but its allowed.""Its when ""Sicko"" ventures across the channel to France that Moore and the movie swoon most amusingly. Three months paid leave for cancer survivors Doctors who make house calls Health-care nannies who do the washing for new mothers ""No one from the government comes to do your laundry in America"" gripes the director.Actually back in America facilities are seen dumping those who cant pay onto the street in their hospital gowns -- Moore has the surveillance-cam footage. The United States is ranked 37th in the quality of its health-care system ""just above Slovenia ."" We have the highest infant mortality rate in the Western Hemisphere.Does Moore present his case even handedly? Not remotely which is one reason hes the rock star of nonfiction moviemakers. In the grand tradition of troublemakers from Thomas Paine to Thomas Nast to Jacob Riis  he dares to have a point of view and the effrontery to press it without tact. Hell fudge a fact or two in the interests of what he considers the greater truth and his critics are happy to call this lying.This can and has (and continues to) get him into trouble and the films walk-in visit to a Cuban hospital seems a medical miracle too rose-colored by half. Perhaps well see all the outtakes in the DVD including whatever it took to set up this sequence.""Sicko"" has so much fun pointing out whats wrong in fact that it can barely be bothered to specify what might make things right. There are plenty of universal health-care proposals out there -- put forth by presidential candidates various states foundations -- but Moore knows the details would cramp his style. His genius as a provocateur is his failure as a policy analyst and thats the American way too Put on a good show but leave the particulars to someone else.Still for once the investigation seems to have fueled Moores outrage rather than the other way around. Whatever you call his movies -- agitprop advocacy entertainment Commie propaganda the Truth -- ""Sicko"" is built to persuade. It succeeds by making us ill with laughter and with shame.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

"Review Sicko a tonic even with flaws - CNN.com Review Sicko a tonic even with flawsStory Highlights ""Sicko"" engages in overstatement at times but still good Michael Moore takes on health care system Film makes best points when Moore simply presents stories Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Americas most inspired polemicist -- and most polarizing filmmaker -- Michael Moore returns to the fray with his first movie since ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" broke box-office records and challenged George W. Bushs White House. Michael Moore talks with a medical professional in ""Sicko."" With ""Sicko"" this time Moore has set his sights on a more amorphous and possibly an even more powerful target HMOs and the American health care industry. A little over a year ago Moore invited citizens to send in their health-care horror stories. Within the week his Web site was inundated with 25000 emails. If this is anecdotal evidence its on a scale worth talking about. ""Sicko"" begins with three cases illustrating the plight of the 46 million Americans without health insurance but quickly moves on to address wider concerns about the kind of care reserved for the lucky 250 million who do have coverage. In a nutshell Moores argument comes down to this the insurance companies are making a killing at their customers expense. And in this industry that term is all too literal. Moore adopts a low profile in the films relatively somber first half softening his familiar snarky stridency for a hushed sincerity more appropriate to the hospital waiting room. Many of the people here are in desperately dire straits sick bereaved or just plain broke. Other interviewees are whistle-blowers guilty and angry about their roles in the Machine. Dont miss Analysis Does Moore get his facts straight? As well they might be. As countless stories have documented Americans face countless problems with their health care. They may be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions -- or retrospectively denied coverage for pre-existing conditions they never knew about. HMOs employ teams of investigators to disallow claimants on technical grounds and some offer medical directors financial incentives to deny drugs and treatments that -- by definition -- cut into corporate profits. (This style is a legacy of the Nixon administration according to a striking scene from ""Sicko"" that plays a snippet from the White House tapes.) When Moore does eventually slouch on screen its to play the innocent abroad a wide-eyed chump bowled over by the wonders of socialized medicine as its practiced in Canada the UK and France. This will be an eye-opener for many -- including the Canadians the Brits and the French probably. Having ""enjoyed"" first-hand experience of two of these three health systems -- the British and the Canadian -- I can attest that theyre not quite as idyllic as Mr. Moore paints them. Except in comparison with the U.S. system of course and thats the point. Moore is a master of overstatement but his comic shtick hits the target more often than not. It only hurts when we laugh. If Moore missteps its in the one sequence he and the Weinstein Company have made sure everyone has already heard about (with a little help from the U.S. government) the boat lift to Cuba for three ailing 9/11 heroes. Its Stunt Man Mike at his crudest and not as effective as he intended. To be sure its bitterly ironic that Guantanamo detainees have access to better medical care than the soldiers who guard them but Moore is easily diverted into a silly commercial for Cuban socialist medicine that plays exactly like the kind of Soviet propaganda films he sends up earlier in the movie. Its tough to see firefighters who have been let down by their own country receiving proper care in Havana but what makes it harder is the suspicion that Michael Moore is treating them like hostages in his own propaganda war. You have to wonder how this squares with the results of the World Health Organization report cited in ""Sicko"" which placed the U.S. at No. 37 one spot above Slovenia -- and if you look fast enough two places above Cuba. But all is fair in love and Moore and the system is sick no question. With four times as many health lobbyists as there are congressmen and with multimillion-dollar campaign donations at stake the prospect of universal care seems a distant hope. (In that regard the brief sequence implying that Hilary Clinton has been bought off may be the most significant.) Its not impossible that this bitterly funny bitterly sad call to alms could move reform back up the political agenda. For that reason alone you owe it to yourself to see this movie.

The word is ""genial."" Not genial as in cheerful though Pixars latest animated feature is certainly that but genial with an accent as in brilliant or inspired. The characters are irresistible -- why would anyone want to resist a hero who so gallantly transcends his rattiness? -- the animation is astonishing and the film a fantasy version of a foodie rhapsody sustains a level of joyous invention that hasnt been seen in family entertainment since ""The Incredibles."" ENLARGE The uncommon denominator of both productions is Brad Bird the writer-director-cum-field marshal who once again has led an army of artists and technicians in the making of a film that feels both personal and classic. Theres the same unerring showmanship which makes a complex story seem luminously logical the same delight in hurtling motion sophisticated comedy (which flatters kids and grownups alike) and copious detail. Instead of using the kitchen of a fancy French restaurant as a picturesque background ""Ratatouille"" explores the workplace and its frenzied rituals -- as well as its intricate hierarchy -- with a screwball zest worthy of the sainted Julia Child. And Remy slices dices and cooks with thrilling ingenuity that overcomes his dual deficits in standing and stature. But is the world ready for a movie that sees an upwardly mobile rodent in a kitchen as a cause for celebration rather than extermination? Once youve met the clean little rat in question and registered the high preposterousness of the premise -- not to mention the elegance of the execution -- the answer is yes. Remy is a born foodie ""If you are what you eat I only want to eat the good stuff."" And hes a dreamer who uses his highly refined sniffer to follow his bliss. What makes him so endearing though -- and surely winning to kids -- is that hes a quintessential outcast an underrat whos first reviled by the very people who come to lionize him. When Pixar Animation Studios released ""The Incredibles"" in 2004 the company served notice that its computer animation techniques could rival or excel much of the action in live-action movies. Now Pixar as part of Disney has taken those techniques to new heights of virtuosity -- and new depths during a vertiginous ride through the City of Lights sewers. (Although the complexities of fluid dynamics have posed formidable problems for animators the results here are so convincing that you wonder if they cheated by pouring water into their computers.) ""Ratatouilles"" tour de force sequence turns on a partnership between Remy and the restaurants dishwasher a clueless gangly kid named Linguini. The rat cooks by remote control as he rides like a cross between a puppeteer and a mahout inside Linguinis toque. Their wild dance is repeated a bit too often but its the funniest thing of its kind since Steve Martins body was possessed by Lily Tomlins spirit in ""All Of Me."" The cast of characters is large remarkably varied and wonderfully voiced especially Ian Holms Skinner the restaurants dwarfish dictatorial head chef; Janeane Garofalos Colette a feminist chef with a passion to succeed in a milieu dominated by men and Peter OTooles Anton Ego a food critic of vulpine physique and acidulous demeanor. Anton is as you might guess an insufferable esthete but he is also bless his caustic soul eager for new experiences. And so it falls to him to taste and savor the vegetable dish of the movies title in a moment of comic revelation that is nothing short of sublime. Sicko When the government stripped Mr. Incredible of his superhero status in ""The Incredibles"" he was reduced to working in the claims department of an HMO where his job was to deny claims. His testimony would have been a worthy addition to ""Sicko"" though Michael Moores argumentative blogumentary about health care is shockingly funny -- and sometimes genuinely shocking -- without him. Mr. Moore sees the United States as a nation in denial so much so that weve slipped to number 37 in a World Health Organization ranking just ahead of Slovenia. Lashing out with Swiftian scorn at a system that leaves almost 50 million Americans uninsured he finds ample reason for outrage in scarifying stories told not only by the uninsured but by those whose insurance companies failed or betrayed them. Just as Al Gore did with global warming in ""An Inconvenient Truth"" he frames the health care crisis in moral and ethical terms. ""Who are we?"" he asks. ""Is this what weve become?"" One might also ask whats new here. Coming at a time when Americas health care system is being scrutinized and debated as never before ""Sicko"" covers familiar ground. Yet the question misses the point for the movies appeal lies at the intersection of its timing and style. Precisely because our concerns about health care have become so immediate and because the production package is so entertaining the shrewdly titled ""Sicko"" may help stimulate the debate. But -- and yes with a Michael Moore film there is always a but -- the filmmaker cant leave ill enough alone. With hardly a nod toward critical thinking he represents the universal health care systems in Canada Britain and France as essentially flawless through the use of ardent interview subjects extravagant praise and slippery rhetorical devices. And the claims he makes for those countries are positively modest in comparison to his discovery of health-care heaven in Cuba (which happens to be 39th in that W.H.O. ranking a fact that can be gleaned from a fleeting close-up of the list but one thats never mentioned in the course of the film). Its bitterly funny when the filmmaker seeks treatment for a group of chronically ill Sept. 11 rescue volunteers by taking them on a boat to the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay where he contends Al Qaeda prisoners get better medical care than mainland Americans. Yet its embarrassing when the jaunty provocateur turns earnest propagandist and sails off with his ad hoc wards to Havana where doctors and nurses are happy to minister to their new patients on camera. (Its also embarrassing that our Treasury Department has put Mr. Moore under investigation for possible violations of the trade embargo against Cuba.) Lots of ""Sicko"" stands as boffo political theater but its major domo lost me by losing his sense of humor. Live Free or Die Hard Dont judge ""Live Free or Die Hard"" by its title which sounds like a license-plate motto or make snide assumptions as I did about the impending death of the ""Die Hard"" franchise. John McClane the New York cop played by Bruce Willis may be long in the tooth but he hasnt lost his bite. This fourth iteration of a series that first burst upon the world in 1988 turns out to be terrific entertainment and startlingly shrewd in the bargain a combination of minimalist performances -- interestingly minimalist -- and maximalist stunts that make you laugh as you gape at their thunderous extravagance. ENLARGE Bruce Willis returns as police detective John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. The film was directed by Len Wiseman from a smart fluent script by Mark Bomback. The plot involves a cyber plot -- a computer-based attack against American institutions particularly financial institutions on a scale so vast that the good guys (at the FBI) as well as the bad guys (in a mobile facility that looks like a Best Buy showroom) call the concerted attack a Fire Sale -- ""everything goes."" And the shrewdest part of the film is its teaming of the creaky (but buff) McClane whos derided by a baddie as a ""Timex in a digital age"" with a young computer whiz named Matt Farrell; hes played by Justin Long the casually charming actor who embodies the cool Mac in those Apple commercials that make fun of Microsofts Windows. (Timothy Olyphant gives another strong performance as the Fire Sales mastermind Gabriel.) The Macs cool carries over but ""Live Free Or Die Hard"" warms it up by putting it in a moral context; Matt must redeem himself however frightened by the danger he may be because he wrote the mutating encryption algorithm -- Im just quoting from my notes -- that gave the Fire Sale program its basic structure. All of this is an elaborate excuse of course for the taciturn John McClane to take endless punishment in the course of saving civilization while kung fu fighters fight a Harrier jump jet harries an 18-wheeler and a cop car goes airborne to bring a chopper down. Good for him and for us.    DVD TIP Ive recommended it before but I keep meeting parents and kids who havent heard of ""The Iron Giant"" (1999). Brad Birds debut feature about a boy and his alien robot isnt on a par with ""The Incredibles"" or ""Ratatouille"" -- how could it be and what is? -- but the film is pretty great in its own right.

"Bravo Sicko - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Bravo Sicko Kenneth TuranTimes Staff Writer NO one ever accused Michael Moore of not having a point of view. A master propagandist and disturber of the peace with an eye for pretense and hypocrisy Moore can orchestrate outrage pro and con like no one else. It wasnt an accident that his ""Fahrenheit 9/ll"" was the highest-grossing documentary of all time; it was business as usual. Moore is back again examining Americas healthcare system in the aptly named ""Sicko."" Its likely his most important most impressive most provocative film and its different from his others in significant ways.For one thing Michael the Confronter the man who relished face-to-face encounters with the rich and powerful is no longer in evidence. ""I wasnt in the mood to do that it was not where my head has been at"" the director said at his Cannes news conference. ""I became tired of yelling and screaming not getting anywhere."" Rather than irritate people what Moore wants to do is have an impact on policy and in an area that touches more Americans more directly than any other hes examined. In fact one of the challenges ""Sicko"" faces is that concerned citizens may feel theyve heard enough on the healthcare debate to last a lifetime.One of Moores gifts however is the ability to go over familiar territory in his own unmistakable way to turn dry policy issues into powerful emotional appeals. A tireless researcher (undoubtedly backed by a hard-working staff) and a master deployer of anecdotal evidence Moore knows if he did it like everyone else no one would be listening. A key to Moores technique is his folksy faux-naive persona complete with puzzled looks a silent-film star would envy and a way of asking disingenuous questions he already knows the answers to in a voice that plays with listeners the way Heifetz played the violin. Moore also has a gift for intuitively understanding how to orchestrate the situations reality provides. Much has been written for instance about his taking a handful of 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba for their medical care but the actual gambit is considerably more sophisticated. After seeing extensive news footage of government officials boasting about the fabulous healthcare Al Qaeda detainees are receiving Moore heads not for Cuba per se but for the notorious prison at Guantanamo Bay. ""We dont want any more care than youre giving the evildoers"" he intones piously through a megaphone at Guantanamos watery entrance. ""Just the same.""And though pre-release news stories assumed that ""Sicko"" would be little more than a compendium of healthcare horror stories Moore in fact has broader points in mind. He believes that profit-driven healthcare is a system that dehumanizes everyone it touches. And its not working particularly well either placing our level of care at No. 37 in the world ""just slightly ahead"" Moore says in that disbelieving voice ""of Slovenia.""Before he gets to those broader points Moore does take a bit of time to set the scene. He gives a nod complete with anecdotes about the dollars-and-cents price paid for severed fingers to the 50 million Americans with no health insurance.Then he moves on with heavy irony to ""those of you who are living the American dream"" namely the 250 million citizens who do have health insurance. As Moore documents with grim examples these people can have such extreme difficulty actually getting their companies to pay their bills that even the people doing the denying are sometimes moved to tears. Curious how we Americans ""a good generous people"" got to this point Moore takes a brief detour into the politics of healthcare focusing on the great number of members of Congress -- including Hillary Clinton whom he first applauds and then derides -- who accept huge campaign contributions from the healthcare industry.Finally and this is the true focus of the film Moore takes in-person trips to Canada Britain France and Cuba showing once again through examples how both patients and care-givers seem to thrive in countries where as one patient puts it ""you dont have to bring a checkbook when you go to the hospital.""Though he doesnt confront anyone Moores amusing presence in these scenes -- for instance searching tirelessly for a cashier in a British hospital only to find that its purpose is to pay patients travel expenses -- give this section its biting humor.What Moore is doing with many of these anecdotes and interviews is countering what he considers to be the domestic myths that have grown up around government-sponsored healthcare such as the idea a favorite of Ronald Reagans in his pre-presidential days that it was the first step toward a communist takeover. (Not quoted but called to mind by all this was a college professor of mine who liked to remind students that the earliest universal healthcare in Europe came courtesy of ""that notorious creeping socialist Otto von Bismarck."")Obviously Moore is being selective about the situations he shows us but his point -- that there is another side to this contentious issue than the one we usually hear -- is difficult to ignore. We would be horrified the filmmaker insists if the police and fire departments were forced to make profits so why should healthcare have to go down that difficult road? We Americans inevitably feel we know the best way to do everything but the great accomplishment of ""Sicko"" is that it is difficult to watch this slyly confrontational film and remain sure. kenneth.turanlatimes.com""Sicko"" MPAA rating PG-13 for ""brief strong language.""

Definitely not what the health-care provider ordered. Yet Moores Sicko the professional provocateurs most accomplished and fervent film is what the movie doc prescribes for temporary relief from the chronic headache that is the American health-care system. It is not a polemic but a plea. Mellower than the crusading grizzly bear of Fahrenheit 9/11 Moore lumbers through the corridors of hospitals from L.A. to London Ontario to London England. His focus is not on his jester self but on Americas health-care hell. Though Moore indulges in acts of political theater that are self-sabotaging for the most part Sicko pointedly contrasts the for-profit system bleeding Americans to death with the socialized systems of other countries. In England and France people at their most physically and emotionally vulnerable dont worry about money to pay for doctors and drugs. How should the worlds richest nation treat a leukemia patient an infant with a dangerously high fever ground zero volunteers whove developed respiratory troubles? Moore hears out the widow of that leukemia patient tears of grief and frustration pooling in her eyes as she explains how her husbands HMO denied his bone-marrow transplant as ""experimental."" He witnesses the infants mother cradling a photo album of her late baby and telling how her HMO Kaiser Permanente wouldnt approve her babys treatment at the closest hospital and how the infant had seizures and eventually ""expired"" as she was transferred from USCs King/Drew facility to a Kaiser-run operation farther away. He listens to the pained testimony of a 9/11 angel of mercy bankrupted by the high cost of an inhaler that runs 120 in the United States and a nickel in Cuba where medicine is socialized. These stories prompt Moore to ask whether other nations have a better answer to health care than managed care. In Moores composite portrait of the U.S. system the nations ailing middle class beggared by deductibles and copays is banging at the gates of the health-care citadel and cant get past the gatekeepers. Barring their entry? Ex-HMO administrator Becky Malke shamefacedly describes her former job as ""being in charge of keeping people from getting coverage."" Linda Peeno once the medical director of Humana is now a whistleblower who describes the function of the HMO as denying limiting or obstructing care in order to maximize profits. Moore subscribes to George Bernard Shaws maxim that ""If you want to tell people the truth you better make them laugh or theyll kill you."" And he leavens his serious comedy with absurdist anecdotes. Funniest is that of the young woman made unconscious by an auto collision and rushed to the hospital who awakened to learn that her insurer had denied reimbursement for the ambulance because it wasnt ""preapproved."" Equaling this story for laughs is the one about the woman who lost her benefits for having had a yeast infection characterized as an undisclosed preexisting condition. Then there is a delicious one involving Philadelphias Cigna Corp. which ultimately does the right thing by one patient. Moore points his camera at the gaping cracks in the American system where as Malke says ""Youre not slipping through; somebody made the crack and swept you in it."" The antidote to this system? Moore proposes socialized medicine. The most eloquent passage in Sicko is an extended interview with Tony Benn a Labor leader who explains the democratic ideology of Englands National Health ""Pay according to your means get treated according to your needs."" It is a system defended by Conservatives and Laborites. And while it may not be as ideal as Moore implies with short waits and every patient cured by the end of his or her visit the single-payer system is simpler to navigate than the maze of preapprovals and preexisting conditions encountered by Americans. Some countries Benn says keep their citizens poor because theyre easier to control. On the other hand ""The National Health relieves your money worries in times of illness."" Where in America HMO physicians are awarded bonuses for denying care in England physicians are awarded bonuses when their patients lower their cholesterol levels. Admittedly Moore shows only the upside of the English and French systems. A downside Taxpayers contribute 27 percent and 42 percent respectively of their annual incomes for coverage which Moore conveniently neglects to mention. Would Americans agree to assign a third of their income for the guarantee of universal health care? In this run-up to the 2008 election its an important question. Im grateful that Moore has guaranteed it a prominent place in the national debate.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 29 2007 Save for later Saved What would the run-up to a presidential election be like without Michael Moore? His new film ""Sicko"" like his last one ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" is a very hot button indeed. But the healthcare industry mess that he documents cuts across party lines. He focuses on one segment of the healthcare equation - the health insurance business - leaving aside any substantive discussion of Big Pharma or hospital malfeasance or the nearly 50 million Americans without health insurance.""Sicko"" is essentially divided into two parts. In the first he offers up a diagnosis of corporate insurance corruption; in the second he posits a cure for the disease.We hear from the mother of an 18-month-old baby who denied emergency room access died of a seizure. We see the widow of a man who denied coverage for a medical procedure died of kidney cancer. The parents of a deaf child are told that insurance will only pay for a cochlear implant in one ear since a double implant is deemed ""experimental."" And so on ad nauseum. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? For just about anybody who has had to deal with the health insurance merry-go-round these stories will seem tragically routine. Moore isnt fomenting anger here; hes simply documenting it. At one point a la ""Star Wars"" a list of preexisting conditions for which one can be disqualified for health insurance scrolls into deep space. It appears to include everything but hangnails. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Moores point here and it is well documented is that the health insurance industry is in the business of maximizing profits a practice often at odds with good healthcare. He shows a well-known clip from Congressional testimony in 1996 by Dr. Linda Peeno a former medical reviewer for Humana stating that her job involved denying claims in order to save the company money.The end result of all this is that according to Moore the US has the worst infant-mortality rate in the Western world and ranks 37th - one notch above Slovenia - in global healthcare.Moores solution to this crisis which occupies the second half of the film is to replace private health insurance with a national universal healthcare system and he demonstrates the efficacy of this approach by journeying with his camera crew to France England Canada and yes Cuba.His forays into these countries where he interviews happy-faced patients and expats and caring physicians does not remotely serve as a controlled study. According to ""Sicko"" no one waits very long for a medical appointment in Canada which Im sure will be news to all the Canadians who are wasting away in waiting rooms. Moore repeatedly refers to the ""free"" medical care the French receive as if no heavy taxation were involved. He also doesnt deal with the two-tier medical system that exists in these countries and the immeasurably quicker treatment one receives if one occupies the upper tier.The Cuban expedition is the most specious part of the movie. Several sick Americans including 9/11 rescue workers denied treatment through their insurance companies arrive with Moore at Havana Hospital and almost immediately are given first-class high-tech treatment for their ills. Leaving aside the matter of Cubas history of human rights violations does it not occur to Moore that his arrival with a camera crew might tip off the Cuban authorities to orchestrate a propaganda moment?As Dr. Leonel Cordova a physician who defected from Cuba in 2000 stated recently in The New York Times party officials and foreigners get the Moore treatment but for the 11 million ordinary Cubans hospitals are ill equipped and patients ""have to bring their own food soap sheets - they have to bring everything.""Barring a middle-class revolt its extremely unlikely that whatever its virtues universal healthcare could ever take hold in America. Still Im glad Moore made his film. It may incite lawmakers in a position to help - at least those who dont feel the need to don windbreakers and baseball caps - to trumpet their faux proletarian credentials.

"With an angry expose` of health care Moore grows up - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeWith an angry expose` of health care Moore grows upBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 06/28/2007 110744 AM PDTUpdated 06/28/2007 112033 AM PDT Its hard to know whether to laugh or cry at Michael Moores ""Sicko"" which is part documentary-style comedy and part tragic travelogue through the American health care system. Sometimes the only thing you can do is laugh and cry at the same time. At this point watching any new film of Moores - or for his detractors not watching but criticizing it anyway - is an experience inescapably shaped by such previous provocations as ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" and ""Bowling For Columbine."" The lopsided liberalism of those films is mostly absent from this one in which Moore seems mad at pretty much everybody who had anything to do with shaping or sustaining the critically ill health care system in the United States. It may come as a surprise to his Moveon.org fan base therefore that most of the politicians Moore blames for the current mess by name are Democrats (although Richard Nixon comes in for a beat-down too) and he takes special pains to pillory Hillary. Moores obvious admiration for Hillary Clintons plans for universal health care during the 90s as the medical czarina of her husbands administration starts off sounding like a big wet kiss for her current presidential bid. But it quickly sours. Moore shows how the far right linked the first ladys reforms to socialized medicine effectively neutering her politically for the remainder of Bill Clintons terms in the White House. The film also reveals that after she was elected to the U.Advertisement S. Senate Clinton became one of the top recipients of campaign contributions from the health and pharmaceutical industries. The medical insurance system that is laid out like a rotting corpse in ""Sicko"" isnt merely corruptible its contemptible. The section of the film that dissects the recent Medicare bill and how it floated through Congress on a wave of political payoffs makes you want to scream at the screen. For the most part ""Sicko"" represents Moores most mature work as a filmmaker. There is less of the cheap-shotting of such eye-level pinatas as Charlton Heston in ""Columbine."" And as director Moore waits 45 minutes to bring his narrator and sometimes heat-seeking star - himself - into the picture. When he does appear Moore approaches his journey through the health care maze in the same way that Mark Twain made himself the principal boob in ""The Innocents Abroad."" Hes a stranger in a strange land full of wonderment at what is going on around him. This device works just fine when he uses it to explain things but this fatuous pose is the cause of occasional disingenuous lines like when he says ""I always thought the health insurance companies were there to help us."" Much of Moores narration drips with sarcasm and most of it is very funny. But this he says with evident sincerity even though its clear that he never thought any such thing. The film quickly runs through a series of testimonials - most of them heartbreaking - from people whose lives have been wrecked by a health insurance system that either declines to cover the procedures they need or whose co-payments and deductibles have drained their life savings. It shows testimony from a former executive at Humana who says the company awarded him bonuses based on the how effectively he denied costly treatment to patients who applied for MRIs or brain scans. Another former executive a physician confesses to a congressional panel that she advanced her own career by rejecting requests from patients pleading for treatment probably killing some of them. Moore isnt a journalist and with ""Sicko"" he isnt interested in getting bogged down in the nuts and bolts of how the ""free"" health care systems in countries to which the United States compares unfavorably - the examples he cites are Canada England France and (a little red meat for Sean Hannity and Bill OReilly) Cuba - pay the bills. The mostly white upper-middle class people whom Moore interviews in those countries (plus a few members of the Cuban proletariat) appear very content with systems that allow them to show up at the doctors office sick - or in France get a house call from the state-run group S.O.S. Me`decins - without ever seeing a bill. It would be reassuring to know that clinics in the immigrant ghettos that ring Paris provide medical care that is just as good but the film never goes there. Moore doesnt stray far from the cafes of the prosperous when hes abroad. He plays most comparisons with the United States for laughs while playing dumb a lot himself. When some expatriate Americans in France tell him that the government provides them with free day care free nannies and even pays to have someone come to their homes to do the laundry Moore gasps and keeps repeating ""No way"" Way. As a diagnosis of what ails us ""Sicko"" can never be more than a snapshot but then so is a chest X-ray. The film focuses on the vast majority of Americans who are enrolled in the health care system whose jobs have conferred upon them what Moore sardonically refers to as ""the American dream"" of full coverage. They are blue collar people who have tried to observe the rules of that system and been left for dead.

"Sicko Michael Moores Anemic Checkup washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Sicko Michael Moores Anemic Checkup Michael Moores documentary about U.S. health care extols Frances system but overlooks the vast difference in population size. (The Weinstein Co.) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 29 2007 Ladies and gentlemen I think we can agree on two things The American health-care system is busted and Michael Moore is not the guy to fix it. His ""Sicko"" an investigation and indictment of that system which is choking on paperwork greed bad policy and countervailing goals turns out to be a fuzzy toothless collection of anecdotes a few stunts and a bromide-rich conclusion. Hes not even above looking hound-eyed into the camera as he stands on a Venetian bridge as a gondola scoots by underneath him and intoning ""Were all in the same boat."" We may be but heres the problem He never tells us which boat. He never goes for the big picture. He has some fun (and gives some fun) with what might be called inciting incidents -- metaphorical examples up-close-and-personals with the aggrieved some muckraking (one hospital secretly dumps rejected patients on the street outside a homeless shelter) and the like. And just when you think youre about to leap off into what in this business we call ""the nut graph"" meaning the you know content he changes thrusts. In the end its as if hes afraid of losing his audiences with charts numbers and assessments from neutral sources unlike the similar techniques used by Al Gore in ""An Inconvenient Truth."" He never interviews actual veterans of the system doctors nurses administrators -- only the victims. Thus we get a bottom-up not a top-down or a full-frontal view of the creaking system. The film progresses from anecdote to anecdote along predictable lines American health coverage = BAD European health coverage = GOOD. He leaves out the boring parts forgetting that as far as policy-intense health-care issues are concerned the only things that matter are the boring parts. His anecdotes draw pointed contrasts with Europe as he returns to France and England as examples of superb health-care systems but the comparisons are never put in any kind of context. France and the United Kingdom each has a population of around 60 million a fifth of Americas 300 million. Is it easier to administer a program so much smaller? I dont know but Im not investigating health care; he is he should and he doesnt. He also spends a great deal of time interviewing both the European beneficiaries of the system and most particularly the doctors to make a point that even in socialized medical systems doctors can still live the high life. This is like a little coded valentine to surgeons who seem to fear government-administered medicine the most; he seems to be saying ""Hey guys even if Hillary takes over you still get to keep the Cadillacs and the country club memberships."" Its a peculiar side trip. The anecdotes are the best parts of the film; Moore has an empathetic gift and hes able to draw eloquent tales of anguish and a sense of abandonment among blue-collar folks who arent used to complaining out loud about the tough breaks theyve caught. Four volunteers who rushed to the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and spent 48 days straight in that hell breathing in the ash and gas and petrochems and melted polyurethanes that filled that rancid air become our point-of-view characters in the film. They all seem like good Joes (or Jolinas) who gave it up for the cremated victims of that day five Septembers ago and now would like nothing more than to breathe again without pain. But of course theres health care theres bureaucracy and where theres b theres s no? Forms are lost claims arent filled diagnoses are challenged. Moore seems shocked to discover that some insurance companies offer incentives to employees -- doctors and investigators -- who turn down claims. But absent that would the system work if everybody got what they wanted when they wanted it and there was no adjudication no prioritizing? What would those economic consequences yield? The question goes unanswered because it goes unasked. He seems to think utopia is a collective wish away. He seems to think it would just be better if it were all free. Except Nothing is free. Somebody has to pay for everything. It may not be the end user (upon whom Moore focuses exclusively) but somewhere somehow somebody has to pay for the nurses aides those purple latex gloves the bandages the hideous green smocks and hair-hiders and of course the various implements for jabbing slicing and otherwise penetrating your trembly body. Some of his stunts dont work out with nearly the comic explosiveness he seems to think they might. In one for example he takes his Sept. 11 rescue workers to the U.S. naval base at Cubas Guantanamo Bay where by archival film hes established that the medical care for the incarcerated alleged terrorists is quite high much higher than its been for his Sicko Four. (He ignores the point that if it wasnt the media would raise holy hell.) He approaches the heavily guarded installation by small boat at sea and pitching and churning in the waters of the bay demands ""better medical care for these American heroes than they can get at home"" The Navy is not amused. Someone pushes a siren button and before the PT boats can be launched and the poor blue collar schlumps sitting there looking seasick are forced to go into a repel-boarders drill Moore wisely turns tail. Its just sort of stupid. But its meant to set up the capital-I irony that in Dr. Castros paradise the rescue workers having traveled up the island to Havana are immediately taken into the finest of medical facilities given free drugs and intensive care and their health is rapidly improved by the TLC and the attention. What was the name of that facility? Oh yeah Potemkin Village Clinic for Abused Heroes of Fascist America or some such. Thats my little joke; the point is what assurance is there that this care wasnt staged entirely for Moores friendly cameras by the not-dumb apparatchiks of Cubas excellent intelligence and propaganda service? That said the movie is partially redeemed I would say by Moores own wit and class He is a funny guy; who knew he was a noble one too? The nobility comes in toward the end when he details his own anonymous -- well its not anonymous now -- contribution of 12000 to a fellow whose wife could not get coverage and whose expenses were breaking him financially so he could not keep up his Web site which basically consisted of screeds meant to destroy Michael Moore. Extremely decent move guy. Moore asks why a man should be forced to choose between paying for his wifes cancer treatments or destroying Michael Moore. Good question. Someone has got to fix it or make it fairer negotiate the unbelievably complex issues and balance sound economic sense with fair play. America fix your boo-boo. As for Moore it can only be said Filmmaker heal thyself Sicko (113 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for brief strong language.

By David Denby Michael Moores documentary is an attack on the American health-care system.   Credit PHILIP BURKE Michael Moore has teased and bullied his way to some brilliant highs in his career as a political entertainer but he scrapes bottom in his new documentary ""Sicko."" The movie is an attack on the American health-care system and it starts out strongly with Moore interviewing families who have been betrayed or neglected by H.M.O.s and insurance companies. A man whose life might have been saved by a bone-marrow transplant died when he was refused ""experimental"" treatment. A feverish baby died when her mother rather than taking her to a hospital run by her insurer Kaiser Permanente rushed her to the nearest emergency room where they were turned away. Moore then zeroes in on the situation of three volunteer Ground Zero rescue workers who have trouble breathing or who suffer from stress and cant get assistance from the federal government. More baffled than angry they soberly report on their conditions and Moore comments that even national heroes arent given help by the nation. A bit later in the film however he presents congressional testimony suggesting that people the Administration has deemed to be national enemies--the detainees at Guantanamo Bay--are receiving good health care free. So Moore loads the Ground Zero volunteers plus some other people who have serious health problems into three boats in the Miami harbor. ""Which way to Guantanamo Bay?"" he calls out to a Coast Guard vessel and the little flotilla sets off for Cuba. When the boats arrive outside the base they are of course stonily denied entrance. An absurdist of outrage Moore has attacked corporations that destroy cities by closing down local plants (""Roger amp; Me""); a gun-happy culture that makes arms easily available (""Bowling for Columbine""); an Administration that begins a war without sufficient cause (""Fahrenheit 9/11""). He has stalked corporate officials and congressmen planted his bulk before them and asked mock-naive questions and his provocations at their best have smoked out hypocrites and liars. But this confrontation is different. Hauling off seriously ill people to a military base where they wont receive treatment is a dumb prank. And the insensitivity isnt much relieved by the piece of whimsy that comes next Moore and the rescue workers (the other sick voyagers having mysteriously disappeared) wander onto the streets of Havana and ask some guys playing dominoes if theres a doctor nearby. They go to a pharmacy and then to a hospital where the Americans are admitted and treated. Few people in Moores audience are likely to be displeased that they receive help from a Communist system. But what is the point of Moores fiction of a desperate wandering quest for medicine on the streets as if he hadnt known in advance that Cuba has free health care? Why not tell us what really happened on the trip--for instance what part Cuban officials played in receiving the American patients? After the early tales of the systems failure ""Sicko"" becomes feeble even inane. A recent poll shows that a majority of Americans not only favor a national health service but are willing to pay higher taxes for it. In that case wouldnt it have made sense for Moore to find out what features of universal care in other countries could be adapted to America? Instead of sorting through any of this Moore and his crew go from place to place--to Canada England and France as well as Cuba--and at every stop he pulls the same silly stunt of pretending to be astonished that health care is free. How much do people pay here in France? Nothing? Youve got to be kidding. But isnt everyone taxed to death to pay for health care? Well heres a nice two-income French couple who have a great apartment and collect sand from the deserts of the world. Not only havent they been impoverished by taxation; they travel. And so on. In each country Moore interviews doctors who speak proudly of how well their countrys system works. But the candor of these doctors is no more impressive than that of the corporate spokesmen Moore has confronted in the past. No one mentions the delays or the instances of less than first-rate care. We find out that a doctor in Great Britain makes a good income (about two hundred thousand dollars) but not how medical care in say Toronto might differ from that in a distant rural area or how shortages may have affected the quality of Cuban health care. Moore winds up treating the audience the same way that he says powerful people treat the weak in America--as dopes easily satisfied with fairy tales and bland reassurances. And since he doesnt interview any of the countless Americans who have been mulling over ways to reform our system were supposed to come away from ""Sicko"" believing that sane thinking on these issues is unknown here. In the actual political world the major Democratic Presidential candidates have already offered or will soon offer plans for reform. A shift to the left or at least to the center has overtaken Michael Moore yielding an irony more striking than any he turns up the changes in political consciousness that Moore himself has helped produce have rendered his latest film almost superfluous. In ""Evening"" based on Susan Minots celebrated 1998 novel an elderly woman Ann Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) lies dying attended by her two daughters (Natasha Richardson and Toni Collette) and by memories of a painful and ecstatic weekend decades before. In the early fifties at the Newport wedding of her best friend (Mamie Gummer) she divided her time between two young men--her friends ranting alcoholic brother (Hugh Dancy) and a handsome young doctor (Patrick Wilson) with whom she fell in love. The elderly Ann drifts in and out of memory and delirium and the director Lajos Koltai aided by a screenplay written by Minot and the novelist Michael Cunningham has concocted a remarkably complicated structure that alternates past and present fantasy and reality. It is perhaps unnecessary to say that Vanessa Redgrave flat on her back makes lucid poetry and vivid emotion out of the most fragmentary and evanescent feelings. I can pay Redgrave no higher compliment than to say that if I have to watch an actor expire for two hours I would rather it be her than anyone else. Meryl Streep as the long-ago bride now grown old has a fine moment too as she lies in bed with Redgrave and the two women look at the past compare marriages and make an accounting of their ""mistakes""--which turn out to be merely life as it is lived rather than as it is hoped for. As the young Ann Claire Danes with her broad shoulders and broad smile has a forceful way about her that makes one want to see more. Watching these performances however is about the only pleasure I got from ""Evening."" This is one of the rare movies that are too sensitive for their own good. In the course of it in both the past and the present all the characters have to spill their feelings about everyone else and the pileup of hurt rue and guilt--confessions and reconciliations and partings--becomes oppressive. The structure that the filmmakers have created is too complicated and fussy for their fairly simple story and what it has to say about time and memory and some of Koltais directorial touches such as a scene in which Redgrave imagines herself chasing little white moths in her bedclothes turn poetry into kitsch. Minots prose which is dreamy and taut at the same time has a distinctive rhythm that probably cant be transferred to film. In truth this sort of mood-memory material would have been done better fifty years ago when it would have starred Lana Turner Rock Hudson Sandra Dee and John Gavin and been directed by Douglas Sirk. The resulting movie--lets call it ""Theres Always Yesterday""--would have been obvious and floridly emotional but it would have had greater energy and theatrical flair than ""Evening"" which isnt much fun. The current crop of players is far more talented than my 1957 cast but refined acting can be a trap. As everyones love object Patrick Wilson is given little to do but stand around and look good. He was very effective as the dumb male dish in ""Little Children"" but if he doesnt find some assertive roles to play hes in danger of turning into a joke. American movies desperately need a young leading man. Hes my candidate.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Treatment Michael Moores best film yet diagnoses a sick health-care system. Plus Yearning rats thrilling Herzog and an overly burnished Evening. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Weinstein Co.) On June 29 two momentous films will open nationwide Sicko which will radically alter your perspective on health care in this country; and Ratatouille which will radically alter your perspective on rats in the kitchen. A cynic would say theres a better chance of a rodents becoming a professional chef than Americas getting universal health carebut that would underestimate the big bellicose rat at the center of Sicko. Michael Moore is a polarizing figure by which I mean he polarizes me. Hes a blowhard and a national treasure. His methods are suspect yet his work is indispensable. Think of him as a Shakespearean foola court jesterwith the slashing fury of a crusader. When the counterculture imploded in the late seventies the left lost its sense of humor and tools like Rush Limbaugh learned to appropriate its prankster spirit. (The Republicans reinterpreted speaking truth to power as razzing feminists and the liberal media.) At the height of Reagan/Bush I torpor Moores Roger amp; Me reclaimed the lefts antic legacy. But there were questions Was Moore using his camera to bludgeon ordinary people? Did he fudge the chronology? Yes and yes. The oaf was always undermining his own credibility. I tsk-tsked when he turned his 2003 Oscar win into an occasion for grandstanding about the invasion of Iraq He had a point but did he have to be so shrill? Yet in the end he shamed many of us when he called Iraq a war for fictitious reasons. No one had put it more succinctly. Why didnt we rise up? Maybe we will this time. Sicko is Moores best film a documentary that mixes outrage hope and gonzo stunts in the right proportions; that poses profound questions about the connection between health care and work; and that throws an unforgiving spotlight on what is in both senses the elephant in the room. The Bush administration was able to stonewall in the face of Fahrenheit 9/11 but this film will hit the working classeven the Republican working classin the kidneys with a large stick. Who cant relate to this movie? Who hasnt been flabbergasted by an insurers denial of payment? You could find millions of anecdotesand Moore good sensationalist that he is comes up with doozies. Some are ghoulishly amusing a guy who gets two fingers cut off but doesnt have the coverage to have them both reattached is given a choice between his ring finger (12000) and his middle finger (60000). (Figuratively speaking Moore gives the insurance company that middle finger.) A woman who is rushed semiconscious to the hospital after a head-on collisionand denied reimbursement for the ambulance ride on the grounds that it wasnt preapproved. A little girl going deaf qualifies for an implant in one ear but not both until her father threatens to contact Moore and the company calls back saying Good news EveryoneMoore the dad the audiencehas a good chuckle over that. But the laughter is short-lived Moore works his way from the absurd to the poignant (a retired couple loses their home after multiple heart attacks and cancer) to the tragic. Insurance companies deny claims (because say a malignant tumor is not deemed life-threatening) and patients die before the appeals process runs its course leaving behind stricken spouses and children. Its hard to keep from weeping when a mother tells the story of how Kaiser Permanente wouldnt let her little girlwho couldnt breathereceive treatment at a hospital that wasnt one of theirs. She didnt make it to one of theirs. Kaiser Permanente emerges as the supervillain if only because of an astounding 1971 Oval Office recording. On the tape John Ehrlichman convinces a dubious (or drunk) Richard Nixon to go along with Edgar Kaisers scheme to create a for-profit managed-care system on the grounds that hospitals would have incentives to give less care. Thats how the current health-care system all began. Really Moore didnt need to do much besides shine a light on these scoundrels people like ex-congressman Billy Tauzin who proclaims his voice quavering that he loves his mother he loves that old woman and thats why the Congress must pass a senior-citizens drug bill. Once Congress does Billy Tauzin leaves to make millions lobbying for drug companies. A repentant former HMO bigwig Linda Peeno explains to Congress that she owes her success to denying a procedure to a man who could have been saved. Every time you pay out its a loss. Youre not slipping through the cracks says an ex-employee tearfully. Somebody made that crack and swept you into it. Stories this potent dont need whacking emphasis and Moore employs his sorrowful persona sympathy for the neglected befuddlement over why why why this has to be. The second half of Sicko is a travelogue; our reporter shambles up to Canada and over to the U.K. and France to see how people bear under national health carethe dreaded socialized medicine. (Moore has great fun with clips of a lusty Soviet agrarian musical.) He asks a Canadian how much a procedure set him back and receives a look of incredulity. Money? Wheres the billing office in this English hospital? Billing office? For what? How can you French people afford to have kids with all these taxes? Oh the government gives us six months paid maternity leave and a nanny to help with diapers. Moore overdoes the slack-jawed-wonderment thing but the differences are uncanny. Hes in riskier territory when he whisks some folksamong them hobbled ground-zero volunteers denied government assistanceoff to Guantanamo (because its defenders boast of its superior medical care) and (failing to gain entrance) to Havana. It is astounding that in Cuba you can pay a nickel for an inhaler that goes for 120 90 miles north. One suspects however that there are trade-offs in the area of civil liberties. The larger issue in Sicko transcends medicine. Moore argues that Americans take dead-end jobs for health insurance then stay in them because employers have them over a barrel. He says if you transform health care youll remake society for the better. Of course powerful people are willing to pay through the nose to make sure that particular theory never gets tested. Moore doesnt mention one of my favorite TV shows House which is regarded in some quarters as daringly frank because its physician protagonist (the incomparable Hugh Laurie) uses painkillers indiscriminately and insults people. But does that man run tests In an instant he and his team of residents will suit up and perform a cat scan or open someones bowel or do exploratory neurosurgery (theyre very versatile)anything to solve some pesky medical mystery. Given the realities of managed care House might be our cultures most powerful opiate. After Sicko how can we watch it the same way? How can we let our politicians feed us sugar pills? 1 2 Next Share this story...

"Sicko | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sicko ) Sicko (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli For his fifth full-length ""documentary"" Michael Moore turns his attention to another hot-button issue health care in the United States. The points he makes - that the health care system is badly broken and other countries accomplish what we have trouble doing - arent revolutionary but they are presented in a compelling manner. For those living in the United States watching Sicko isnt an uplifting experience. Moore as has been adequately reported over the years isnt a hard-hitting journalist or a documentarian in the traditional sense of the job description. Hes more of a rabble rouser and a button pusher. His ego often gets in the way of his making a point (as happens on several occasions during Sicko) but he knows how to edit and spin in such a way that even the driest of topics can become compulsively watchable. As a documentary this movie has the same problems as all of those in Moores oeuvre; as a polemic or a visual op-ed piece its an effective piece of filmmaking. Moores thesis and approach in Sicko is straightforward and the film hangs together a lot better than his previous rant Fahrenheit 9/11 which lacked focus. Moore starts by cherry-picking horror stories from the American health care system in which people die because they are denied treatment or referrals lose fingers because they cant pay the hospital to have them re-attached after an accident and are prematurely discharged from hospitals because of cost issues. While the cases Moore documents are extremes anyone who has battled an HMO or sat in an emergency room understands that when it comes to medical coverage in the United States greed trumps need. Having illustrated some of the most glaring failings of the U.S. system Moore takes his viewers to four other countries where the concept of ""universal health care"" has changed the way people view disease and disability Canada England France and Cuba. Moore arguably goes overboard in praising the systems of these countries but his central question is valid if they can do it why cant we? Curiously its a question he doesnt pursue with much vigor perhaps because the answer is obvious. He touches on the political power of drug companies and insurance companies but is surprisingly restrained in attacking them. Moore weakens his case by occasionally lobbing politically motivated smoke bombs into the proceedings. Health care isnt a political issue since many Republicans and Democrats have been bought and paid for by corporations who have a vested interest in the status quo. The anti-Bush/pro-Clinton scenes make Moore appear petty and distract from the importance of his overall message. But thats Moore - his stated goal with Fahrenheit 9/11 was to present an expose of the Bush administration that would force the President out of office after one term. Moores ego also looms larger here than in any of his previous films. Toward the end of Sicko he recounts a tale of his ""generosity"" (sending an anonymous check of 12000 to the webmaster of an anti-Moore site who couldnt pay for his wifes health care). What could have been a kind gesture is turned into an example of self-aggrandizement by its inclusion here. There is a sequence in Sicko in which Moore takes a group of ill 9/11 volunteers to Cuba to receive the health care they have been denied in the United States. The government is allegedly pursuing possible charges against Moore for breaking a trade embargo with the communist country; however considering the context any such action is frivolous and treading close to violating Moores First Amendment rights. On the other hand news stories about this are bringing Sicko a lot of publicity making one wonder whether a master spin doctor like Moore might be using this to his advantage. In some ways Moore is his own worst enemy. In the past he has twisted facts and distorted statistics to such an egregious degree that supposedly hard data in Sicko deserve to be placed under the microscope of skepticism until they are proven one way or the other. For the most part however Sicko stays away from figures and numbers and concentrates on first-person accounts a few of which are heart-wrenching. Thats not to say that Moore always plays fair but that has never been part of his agenda. Whether Moore is preaching to the converted and whether there are flaws in his sermon doesnt detract from the import of the message. As is his trademark he does what he can to impart a degree of entertainment to a serious subject. The movie is well put together if a little long (the sequences in Canada England and France could be shortened) but theres a good mix of humor and pathos. Sicko is flawed but effective. Most importantly regardless of its overall veracity it provides an opportunity for open and frank dialogue about an issue that has been politicized and ignored for far too long in this country. Whatever anyones feelings may be about Michael Moore its hard to disagree with his argument that health care in the United States is broken and needs to be fixed.

Thursday June 21 2007 934 PM See also Photo Gallery ""Sicko"" premiere in NYC Film essayist Michael Moore has chosen fat targets before - corporate bullies gun fetishists war profiteers - but with ""Sicko"" hes got his biggest and most entrenched target yet. ""Sicko"" which takes on Americas profoundly profitable and catastrophically inefficient health care system is Moores most assured least antagonistic and potentially most important film. Anecdotal in nature ""Sicko"" shows whats wrong with our health care system by comparing it with those in Canada England and France where universal health care is as ingrained in the social fabric as their national anthems. Asked what would have happened in England if Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair had tried to dismantle the National Health Service an elderly British statesman answers without pause ""There would have been a revolution."" In the U.S. politicians in the pockets of medical industry lobbyists respond to any universal health care movement by screaming ""Socialism"" And as Hilary Clinton learned it works. Though Moore raised the dander of conservatives by taking ailing 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba for treatment they couldnt get at home ""Sicko"" is a darkly funny and relatively stunt-free polemic. No we dont meet any Americans who have good health care stories to tell. But this is a picture about the big picture showing that the U.S. while investing far more money in health care than any other country ranks 38th in the world in effectiveness - far far behind every other Western industrialized nation. The reason for this poor return is that most of the money ends up in the bank accounts of the insurance and pharmaceutical companies both of which are driven to improve the financial health of their stockholders. Moore who has a major but inoffensive presence in the film found insurance company examiners whose job it is to find reasons not to approve claims even if the patient is fatally ill. And he found a retired insurance company hit man whose job it was to find reasons in peoples medical histories to reclaim money already paid out and revert the debt to them. In England where the motto is ""Pay according to your means get treated according to your needs"" government-paid doctors receive bonuses for improving the health of their patients.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME George W. Bush recognized there was a crisis in the American health care system. But he thought the problem was that physicians six-figure incomes werent high enough. ""Too many good docs are getting out of the business"" the graduate of Yale and Harvard said in his homespun way in September 2004 two months before he was reelected. ""Too many OB-GYNs arent able to practice their love with women all across this country."" These days its almost too easy to make fun of the President; hes a lame duck who needs medical attention and fortunately he can afford it. (And if he couldnt his bills would be paid for by the people as is the health care of all Senators and Congressmen.) Besides Michael Moore had his instructive Bush-bashing in Fahrenheit 9/11 the highest-grossing documentary of all time earning 119 million at the domestic box office and lots more overseas. [an error occurred while processing this directive] So after beginning Sicko with this Bush malapropism Moore stays pretty clear of Dubya jokes pausing only to mention the extravagant amounts the medical industry gives to elected officials (including one-time health-care reformer Hillary Clinton). Instead he lards his new documentary with stories of ordinary Americans whose health insurance did not cover the diseases and accidents their plans should have paid for and whose prescription drugs were unaffordable. Like Donna and Larry Smith both in their 50s both career workers both with HMOs. But when she got cancer and he had heart trouble the bills mounted so fast that they had to sell their home and move to Denver into their daughters basement. That humiliation saved them just enough money that they could spend the rest of their life savings on treatment and medication. Moore isnt the first to say that the health care system is sick -- that its riddled with inequities and iniquities. Hes never the first to address a gut issue whether its corporate greed (Roger amp; Me) American violence (Bowling for Columbine) the politics of terror (Fahrenheit 9/11). But hes the one who does it the noisiest with the highest entertainment value mixing muckraking with showmanship Ida Tarbell with P.T. Barnum. His new movie -- which has its world premiere tonight in Cannes and opens in North America June 29th -- fits honorably in that tradition. As both harangue and movie tragicomedy Sicko is socko. Moore is such a big fat target metaphorically speaking that he attracts attacks from swarms of ideological critics thus bringing his message to more people. Last week for example the Treasury Department indicated it would investigate Moore for taking a trip to Cuba to check out Castros medical system. (Guess what he found? Its better than ours) Moore shot back with an open letter that claimed the Bush Administration was ""abusing the federal government for raw crass political purposes."" It was his way of saying thank you for all the free publicity. Moore has a genius for confrontational stunts -- demanding a meeting with General Motors Chairman Roger Smith chatting up an addled Charlton Heston on gun control buttonholing Congressmen to see if any of them had actually read the Patriot Act -- but the Cuba jaunt tops them all. It begins when he hears Congressional testimony indicating that detainees at Guantanamo were getting free colonscopies and nutrition counseling. (One female soldier cited in the film says ""They get way better health care than I do."") So he rounded up several volunteer rescue workers from the World Trade Center site who had suffered respiratory and other diseases and said their medical plans did not cover treatment for all their ailments. Off they sailed from Florida to Gitmo in the vagrant hope that 9/11 heroes might get the same high-end care the government said it was lavishing on 9/11 terror suspects. His bullhorn pleas met with silence Moore took his cargo of the ailing -- the rescue workers Donna and Larry Smith and a few others featured in the film -- to Havana where they got excellent imaginative sympathetic care from a local clinic. (At least one of the patients returned on her own and told the Associated Press she received the same level of treatment.) Already without having seen the film anti-Moore websites have collected claims that many Cuban hospitals unlike the one shown in Sicko are dilapidated and crawling with cockroaches. Uh-huh. That means theyre almost as bad as Walter Reeds Building 18 to which Iraq-vet outpatients were sent. Moore doesnt bother to address this point which helped galvanize public opposition to the war. (Was it too late for inclusion in the film or too easy a target?) Nor when he asserts that ""18000 of them [Americans] will die each year simply because they didnt have health insurance"" does he trouble to note that thats more than five times the number of U.S. military deaths in the four-plus years of the Iraq occupation. ""What has become of us? Where is our soul?"" Sicko traces the birth of the privatized health system to Richard Nixon who in 1971 on one of the White House tapes noted that the scheme would work for insurance companies ""because the less care they give em the more money they make."" Hardly anyone would deny that since then the HMOs and pharmaceutical companies have made billions while Americans have health care below the standard of other industrialized countries and pay more for it. (Even the flacks for HMOs acknowledge that the system needs reform.) Or that patients are routinely denied procedures they should be entitled to. ""Youre not slipping through the cracks"" a claims adjuster since reformed tells Moore. ""They made the crack and are sweeping you toward it."" Im sure scholars of the U.S. health care system even those without a political grudge will be able to poke holes in some of the movies arguments and address some important points the movie ignores. The upside of this populist documentary is that there are no policy wonks crunching numbers and reducing patients anguish to sterile statistics. The downside There are no policy wonks crunching numbers and saying soberly how much a national health care plan would cost U.S. citizens. In a 2hr. movie Moore could have taken a couple mins. to tote up the expected tab. Like most docu-dramatists Moore loves to show the tears of those screwed by the System; in Sicko at least seven interviewees start crying as they describe the lack of attention their maladies got. And when theyre not getting misty over the inhumanity of it all you may -- when you see surveillance footage of mentally disoriented outpatients from the high-end University of Southern California hospital who are put in a cab and dumped near an L.A. Skid Row homeless facility when their coverage runs out. Moore also likes to play Santa Claus. One child who had been approved for one but not two cochlear implants when she started losing her hearing received an OK for the second implant from CIGNA after her father waved the red flag of Moores interest in the case. The filmmaker also sent 12000 anonymously (well not any more; its in the movie) to a Moore-hating blogger who was going to shut down his site to pay for his wifes hospital bills. Most photogenically Moore brought his 9/11 boat people to Cuba. They might have gone to Canada France or Britain three other countries with generous government health plans. Moore has fun showing the cashiers window at a London hospital where patients dont pay anything they get money for the trip back home. Any prescription under the U.K. National Health plan he suggests costs only about 12. And in France the government will pay not only for health costs but for nannies. Theyll even cook for you and do your laundry. If Sicko doesnt win over the audience at tonights black-tie world premiere Moores francophilia should do the trick. Id take odds on a 15-min. standing ovation. The chronically scruffy auteur may play the game tonight and get all tuxed up. But hes still a blue-collar kid from Flint Michigan -- the car town that became a poor town when GM closed many of its plants. A classic entertainer and a professional mensch he knows how to couch a daunting issue in human terms. In Sicko as he said at a Cannes press conference today the larger questions are ""Who are we? What has become of us? Where is our soul?"" Hes latched onto an issue that affects more Americans more directly than gun violence or Islamic terrorism. The folks in Flint neednt worry overmuch that al-Qaeda will bomb the Longway Planetarium (whose Classic Vinyl laser show begins today) but they can count on getting ill and needing to pay the bills. Its something most Americans worry about; Moore says they shouldnt have to. As he said to AP ""We are the richest country in the world. We spend more on health care than any other country. Yet we have the worst health care in the Western world. Come on. We can do better than this."" And what will Americas top guerrilla docu-comic do after Sicko? ""I think its time for a romantic comedy"" he told TIME. But surely there are other bones of contention sticking in his throat. The political use of religion should appeal to this leftie whos still a practicing Catholic. Or how about the threat of climate change and the waters rising over Moores Manhattan home. What if he were to blend the two issues? He could take as his text this quote from God straight from the Bible ""I establish my covenant with you that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth."" If you want me to cite chapter and verse its Genesis 911.

Three years after winning Cannes top prize for ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" docu helmer and agent provocateur Michael Moore returns to the Croisette with more polemics-as-performance-art in ""Sicko"" an affecting and entertaining dissection of the American health care industry showing how it benefits the few at the expense of the many. Pics tone alternates between comedy poignancy and outrage as it compares the U.S system of care to other countries. Given Moores celebrity and fan base plus heightened awareness of the pic resulting from the heated battle thats already begun between left and right returns look to be extremely healthy. Pic should also play well internationally providing an eye-opening lesson for foreigners who may be inclined (like Moores Canadian cousins) to take out insurance from their homeland before visiting the States. Chief criticism of the film is that it paints too rosy a picture of the national health care of the countries he compares America to including Canada England France -- and Cuba. Employing his trademark personal narration and David vs. Goliath approach Moore enlivens what is in essence a depressing subject by wrapping it in irony and injecting levity wherever possible a graph shows Americas position in global health care as No. 38 -- just above Slovenia -- and is followed by film footage of primitive operating conditions; and he offers a long list of health conditions that can deny a person insurance coverage with the list scrolling into deep space accompanied by the ""Stars Wars"" theme. Pic explores why American health care came to be exploited for profit in the private sector rather than being a government-paid free-to-consumers service as are education libraries fire and police. Moore comes up with an archival audio recording of Richard Nixon from February 1971 praising Edgar Kaiser and his system using incentives for less medical care. The next day Nixon addresses the nation proposing a new health care strategy that amounted to a less-per-patient expenditure to maximize profit. Pic starts by sketching a gamut of health-care horror stories from average Americans those who cant afford insurance those who are denied coverage for various often ludicrous reasons and those who believe themselves well-protected but find that the moment they avail themselves of medical services their insurance provider uses obscure technical reasons to refuse coverage retroactively deny claims and cancel insurance or raise rates so astronomically that the patient is forced into the ranks of the nearly 50 million uninsured. Perhaps the most emotionally affecting story comes from Julie a hospital worker whose husband had a potentially terminal illness that the medical staff thought could be treated with a bone marrow transplant. Insurance deemed the treatment experimental and refused to cover it. Unable to afford an alternative the husband died. The congressional testimony of a former Humana medical director provides a devastatingly direct description of what she calls ""the dirty work of managed care."" Constantly told that she was not denying care to patients rather simply denying them Humanas coverage her career advanced as she saved her corporation money. Moore appears in his shambling folksy persona about 40 minutes into the pic interviewing foreign citizens American expatriates hospital workers and doctors in countries with nationalized health care. The dramatic contrast with America is played for laughs as the seemingly incredulous Moore continually mutters ""What do you mean its free?"" Pics most dramatic (and now controversial) tactic involves Moore taking a group to Cuba that includes 9/11 rescue volunteers with medical problems that havent been covered by insurance. First they go to Guantanamo Bay which Moore proclaims as the only place on American soil with universal health care and then to a Havana hospital where they are given treatment. Cuban seg wraps with a poignant expression of emotional solidarity between 9/11 volunteers and Cuban firemen who pay them homage. Pic incorporates extensive archival footage (some of which comes across as grainy on the bigscreen) as well as home movies and photographs. Extracts from Communist musicals classic comedies and horror films provide Moore further opportunity for comic editorializing.
