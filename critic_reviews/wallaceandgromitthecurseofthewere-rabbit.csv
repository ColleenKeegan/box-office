At films end the heroine Lady Tottington and the dread Were-Rabbit have a housetop confrontation worthy of (i.e. stolen from) King Kong. The whole rollicking adventure...

It isnt. As with Parks previous claymation works every movement here has been painstakenly stop-frame animated with presumably only occasional help from a computer. Trouble is the finished article is so CGI-like that you wonder whether all that organic stop-frame stuff was necessary. Sorry chaps. Wallaces hilarious Heath Robinson-esque inventions are still to the fore and in this instance responsible for the outcome of much of the plot which is somewhat superficial. With the annual giant vegetable competition on the horizon the locals are dependent on cheese-loving Wallace and his heroic hound Gromits pest-control company Anti-Pesto to keep at bay the ravaging rabbits that threaten to devour the neighbourhoods prized veggies. In a misguided effort to brainwash one of their captors into hating vegetables Wallace hooks himself and a test bunny up to his latest gizmo. Needless to say it goes awry and before long the neighbourhood is being terrorised by a gigantic rabbit. Parks previous outing Chicken Run played like The Great Escape and this ups the film-borrowing quotient even further to include scenes from The Fly King Kong Frankenstein Curse of the Werewolf even Tremors. The pun level is sky high (I especially liked Wallaces retro Smug fridge). Sadly though it treads water during the closing stages and its left to Gromits silent deadpan stoicism and ingeniously expressive Do I need this? facial language to win the day.

(Is she trying to carve out a new niche?) ""Tim Burtons Corpse Bride"" already in theaters is a delirious Goth nightmare; ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" opening today takes place in a world closer to our own but is no less delightful. Wallace and Gromit have been around for 16 years now since they first appeared in an Aardman Animations short film called ""A Grand Day Out"" nominated in 1990 for an Academy Award. Wallace voiced by Peter Sallis is a suburban Brit with a pear-shaped head (when he smiles his mouth pushes out sideways wider than his ears); Gromit is his faithful industrious and ever-silent pooch. The two live together in a house filled with the labor-saving inventions theyre always creating and with the loving detail that the Aardman crew provides (including in the kitchen larder a jar of something called Middle-Age Spread). In their first feature-length film directed by their creator Nick Park with Steve Box Wallace and Gromit must face a formidable foe the Were-Rabbit a mysterious veg-loving creature whos been having nighttime feasts on neighborhood gardens. As the 517th annual Giant Vegetable Competition is fast approaching and headlines like ""Night of vegetable carnage"" dominate the newspapers the neighbors turn to Wallace and Gromit and their pest-control company Anti-Pesto to nab the critter. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" with the voices of Peter Sallis Helena Bonham Carter Ralph Fiennes Peter Kay Nicholas Smith Liz Smith. Directed by Nick Park and Steve Box from a screenplay by Box Park Bob Baker and Mark Burton. 85 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. This involves some nifty inventions -- such as a vacuumlike device that sucks happy bunnies through a tube alive and well -- and some unexpectedly dire turns of events including a scene in which a vicar is forced to defend himself with a zucchini. (Now theres a phrase I never thought Id write.) The humor is low-key but hilarious; you may well find yourself giggling hysterically at the sight of dozens of angelic bunnies cheerfully waving goodbye or springing up from the ground like pea shooters or a line like ""There may be a large rabbit dropping."" And theres a hint of romance too as Wallace finds himself in close proximity with the lovely pretzel-haired gardener Lady Tottington (Bonham Carter poshly swallowing all her end consonants). The two have a scene thats as close to racy as these movies get Lady Tottington bemoaning her sometime beau Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes) notes that ""Hes never shown any interest in my produce"" while suggestively holding a pair of melons. (The constant gardener indeed.) All this is done in charmingly low-tech clay animation; you can see the squishiness of the plasticine used to model the characters particularly in their faces and ever-moving lips. And the very Britishness of it all -- right down to Wallaces string vests and the dodgy-looking teeth on most of the characters -- survives intact despite the American big-studio funding. This movie is a treat; take the kids and have a grand day out.

His upper-crust breeding shows as he moves swiftly from the kitchen into the garden to throw up. Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson imbue the couple with an intensity more powerful for being understated. They know when to pause and these timeouts -- allowing for the sound of a knife against a chopping board or ice clinking in a glass -- are as menacing as the verbal punches Anne and James hit each other with. Wilkinsons face becomes red and distorted with pain. He and his lovely co-star are the best sort of actors capable of disappearing into their roles. Their believable portrayals of a distressed couple do much to raise ""Separate Lies"" above the ""Masterpiece Theatre"" level. Still the film often plays like something you would see on PBS -- high quality but not cinematic enough to fill a big screen. In its weakest moments it resembles an imported British TV mystery. The whodunit elements involving the identity of a hit-and-run driver who causes the death of a bicyclist never quite jell even after the guilty party is exposed. ""Separate Lies"" works best as a searing portrait of an upper-class couple -- the kind who keep a home in London and another in the country. Julian Fellowes who wrote the script (based on the novel ""A Way Through the Wood"") and directs for the first time is on familiar ground. He won a screenwriting Oscar for ""Gosford Park"" in which he assiduously delineated the various levels of servants toiling downstairs in British mansions. Fellowes knows that James an international lawyer would dress in impeccably tailored pin-striped suits and that Anne would spell her name with an ""e."" No Lady Chatterley she takes a lover from her own class a bit of a rogue named Bill played with assured nonchalance by Rupert Everett. Anne is all too aware that he doesnt give a fig about her. But shes tired of falling short of her husbands high standards and Bill isnt the judgmental sort. While shrinks might diagnose Annes behavior as acting out she seems to be rather enjoying herself. Watson -- for my money the sauciest British actress since Glenda Jackson took up politics -- appears visibly more sensual once the affair commences. After confessing her infidelity Anne suggests to her husband that the three of them get together. ""That would be a little too Jerry Springer for me Im afraid"" James replies -- just one of many witty lines Fellowes has composed for his able cast. Hes much stronger with words than images. ""Separate Lies"" often looks claustrophobic despite numerous wide-angle shots of the English countryside. Theres a touching subtext about children and their impact on keeping a marriage vital. Anne and James dont have any and he wonders out loud if they were wrong to stop trying. Walking through a park he tosses a ball to a youngster eyeing him longingly as if wondering if things would be different if he were their son. Its an illuminating moment in a film with a lot to say about the human condition. -- Advisory This film contains strong language. -- Ruthe Stein Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit Animated comedy. Starring Peter Sallis Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by Steve Box and Nick Park. (Rated G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For those unacquainted with the animation of Aardman Studios ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" takes a little getting used to. The clay characters are often misshapen to make them easier to handle in the frame-by-frame shooting. All of the characters have huge mouths with bad teeth that look them look like Julia Roberts after a few months of crystal meth use. And the humor is extremely English. But the characters in this G-rated comedy -- a bumbling inventor and his caretaker dog -- are so winning that it should take only a few minutes to adjust. Wallace and Gromits first feature film is very imaginative and can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages. While previous short films starring the duo added one or two other characters ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" presents a whole city with dozens of sets and even more personalities. The movie borrows heavily from several werewolf films ""King Kong"" and other classics but still has an original vibe. Wallace and Gromit run Anti-Pesto a humane pest control service that catches bunnies with a giant vacuum. An experiment to get those rabbits off carrots goes awry and a giant half-human half-rabbit (but still kind of cute) monster starts terrorizing everyones cherished gardens just hours before the towns competitive vegetable-growing contest. The movies 85 minutes go fast and all thats left are small complaints. Like the recent ""Fantastic Four"" movie ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" presents the backward logic of heroes fixing a problem that they were responsible for in the first place. And there is a bit of a cultural barrier with some of the jokes -- its kind of disturbing and not all that funny that the main character likes cheese so much. Maybe it has something to do with the tedious nature of creating stop-motion animation -- this film took five years to complete -- but the medium appears to spawn an imaginative finished product. ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is teeming with activity and clever asides. Even the toupee jokes aimed at bad guy Victor Quartermaine (voiced by an unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes) are presented in a way that seems fresh and new. -- Advisory While this film is rated G it is definitely a hard G. There are a few vegetable-related sexual innuendos. And although you cant see his naughty bits the dog doesnt wear pants -- which is especially strange because he does wear a hat. -- Peter Hartlaub Three Dancing Slaves Drama. Staring Nicolas Cazale Stephane Rideau and Thomas Dumerchez. Directed by Gael Morel. Running time 90 minutes. In French with English subtitles. (Not rated. 90 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Director Gael Morels meditation on male sexuality and fraternal bonds is easy on the eyes. That doesnt necessarily make it interesting. Told in three parts this lovingly crafted film focuses on three brothers in a rural French town as they struggle to define themselves while coming to terms with the death of their mother. A deep topic to be sure one thats given short shrift by a director too besotted with his characters physical beauty to dwell on the uglier stuff under their skins. Fresh out of prison eldest brother Christophe (Stephane Rideau) abandons youthful indiscretions to take a job in a pork factory; this rankles middle brother Marc (Nicholas Cazale) whose own life of crime is just getting started. While Marc spirals through loops of drugs tranny sex and dog killing shy youngest brother Olivier (Thomas Dumerchez) studies capoeira (the martial art that inspires the films ungainly title) and falls in love with Marcs best friend. Their widowed father glowers over it all with clucking paternal impotence. Working from a spartan script co-written with Christophe Honore (writer-director of last years ""Ma Mere"") Morel has crafted a luscious yet ultimately empty film that takes a voyeurs approach to the beautiful young men whose lives seem to center on posing their bodies in provocative tableaus. Clothed or nude their physicality is so fetishized in scenes of glistening sweat and musculature that their inner lives become afterthoughts; for Morel the brothers and their friends are little more than animated objects housing inarticulate longing. The films money shot and its metaphoric core shows the brothers sleeping together in a naked tangle of limbs that renders them indistinguishable from one another. Thats the problem with the lovely but frustrating ""Three Dancing Slaves"" The characters are a mass of flesh when they should be a sea of emotion. The result is just another pretty -- and pretty insubstantial -- study in masculine angst. -- Advisory Contains nudity strong language and sexual situations. -- Neva Chonin  Henri Langlois  The Phantom of the Cinematheque Documentary. Directed by Jacques Richard. In French with subtitles. (Not rated. 128 minutes. At the Roxie.) Henri Langlois was the greatest film preservationist the medium has ever had. Movie buffs who love their Bergman Stroheim and Truffaut are indebted to him. For his efforts Langlois was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1974. But who knows the full story of the Frenchman who despite his celebrated status died impoverished in an unheated Paris apartment? ""Henri Langlois The Phantom of the Cinematheque"" is a treat for anyone whos passionate about films or whos ever wanted to learn more about them. Through rare archival footage the documentary profiles a man who single-handedly saved countless films from destruction and also helped promote them for an international audience. All this he did out of a pure and deep love of cinema and without an eye toward making a single sou. Langlois (1914-1977) started collecting films at a time when few thought doing so was necessary. The art form wasnt even a half century old yet Langlois had the foresight to view it as an endangered species a precious window into our past. In 1935 Langlois formed a film club with Georges Franju; soon after they founded the Cinematheque where they stored and screened films often past midnight. As the documentary makes clear the French government early on had little interest in backing what it did not recognize as a crucial part of its cultural heritage and Langlois ran the Cinematheque as a cash-strapped private institution that got by on donations. He cherished his role as a feisty underdog. Forever animated and forever smoking the portly Langlois in his baggy cardigans was the ideal scruffy ambassador for art films. Holding court at the Cinematheque he helped launch the careers of Godard Truffaut Rohmer and many other directors. Filmmakers and actors from around the world would visit Paris to take part in his programs and tour his pioneering Museum of Cinema. If visitors showed up without money he would let them in for free. Eventually Langlois authority was challenged by bureaucrats who thought they could better manage what Langlois himself had created. (One admirer in the film defends Langlois ""scientific sense of disorder."") In 1968 Langlois was fired and rioting cinephiles famously clashed with police and had their hero reinstated. Decades after Langlois death there are signs that film preservation is gaining more respect. Just last week a new Cinematheque Francaise was opened in an elegant building designed by the renowned architect Frank Gehry. Hopefully itll live up to Langlois legacy. -- John McMurtrie 24 Hours on Craigslist Documentary. Directed by Michael Ferris Gibson. (Not rated. 82 minutes. At the Red Vic and on Tuesday the Parkway in Oakland.) ""Seeking 270lb woman."" For those wondering who posted that personal ad on Craigslist hes a middle-aged weathered and balding smoker who likes to sit on his suburban front porch and yell at the kids in the neighborhood. Ladies still interested? The would-be lothario is just one of many Bay Area residents whose online anonymity is unmasked in the documentary ""24 Hours on Craigslist."" A series of vignettes that are edited in much the same way one might click from one random Craigslist posting to the next the film is a fun and free-form celebration of the sites communal spirit and only-in-San Francisco ethos. We encounter a butler for hire a mother trying to sell six strollers and a couple who operate a fetish Web site devoted to women who wear glasses. One of the most entertaining interviewees is a man looking to create a 70s-like guitar band -- with him singing lead as Ethel Merman. All are cleverly introduced in the film with the same sky-blue font that Craigslist uses on its simple and gloriously ad-free site. Limited to the one day of shooting Craigslist proposed -- the site likes to protect users anonymity -- director Michael Ferris Gibson nevertheless found numerous compelling stories to tell. Some reveal the more depressing and sleazy aspects of the site including a woman who seeks a gay man for money and a creepy man whos hosting a subterranean ""sex party"" that no one thankfully attends. Not all the vignettes make for riveting viewing. And a bit too much attention is paid to the ""mystery"" of Craig Newmark the founder of the site who is treated like a wizard and only shown from behind in the film. As Newmark says of himself in his online bio ""He aint no big deal."" But others will have their say. How this film fares may well be determined by whats written about it on the very site it documents. -- Advisory Adult language. -- John McMurtrie The Overture Drama. Directed by Itthisoontorn Vichailak. In Thai with English subtitles. (Not rated. 104 minutes. At the Balboa) The ranad is a classical Thai instrument looking much like a wooden xylophone. In Itthisoontorn Vichailaks ""The Overture"" masters of the ranad work their way into elite favor by facing off in musical duels as in ""Drumline"" or the dueling banjos sequence in ""Deliverance."" Its pretty fun to watch and a fascinating window into Thai culture. Unfortunately Vichailaks film which is ""based"" on the story of Thailands master musician Luang Pradit Phairao (1881-1954) is a by-the-numbers simple tale that pulls out all the cliched melodramatic stops when it should be exploring an obviously fascinating character in Thai history. Possibly the problem is that the historical person has been ""fictionalized"" -- usually a bad sign -- and is here called Sorn. As a younger man he is played with wide-eyed solemnity by Anuchit Saphanphong and he shows an early aptitude for music despite his fathers efforts to deny him the opportunity to play. Thailand is as harmonious as its instruments in these scenes in tune with its traditional self. In his last years the elderly Sorn is played by the stately Adul Dulyarat who stubbornly defies the Japanese imperial rulers World War II-era attempts to Westernize by outlawing certain Thai traditions. There are interesting tidbits in this lushly photographed movie but the tide of social change is frustratingly glimpsed at never explored and Sorn seems like an archetype out of a textbook rather than a real person. If only Vichailak had cut loose as Sorn does in the final ranad showdown this could have been something special. -- Advisory Some scenes of violence. -- G.

"We were rabbits once . . . and funny - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Cheese We were rabbits once . . . and funnymovies - reviewOctober 7 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticIts not clay theyre molding for these delightful Nick Park animations of chickens dogs and a Brit-twit named Wallace. Its gags.Ingeniously conceived immaculately constructed and elaborately stretched-out sight gags. Puns visual and verbal.And giggles. Oh my yes the giggles. Lets not forget those.Wallace Parks daft cheese-loving English inventor and his chauffeur valet and all around Dog Friday Gromit are now in their first feature film. Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were Rabbit is all Wallace amp; Gromit fans could hope for -- a silly and cuddly dab of Silly Putty animation from the folks who gave us Chicken Run but who made their reputations doing short films about a daft Englishman and his dog.Our intrepid duo are running a rodent-removal service in their retro-corner of Olde England -- Anti-Pesto they call it. Theyre humane removers of rabbits from gardens. Of course Wallace has an invention or three to help with that.Its a big deal in a town where the annual ""biggest vegetable contest"" absorbs dotty old ladies batty old men dizzy vicars and the woman who runs it Lady Tottington voiced with a fluttery flightiness by Helena Bonham Carter.Shes fending off two pests -- acres of rabbits and her trigger-happy toupee-sporting upper-class fop of a suitor Victor. Ralph Fiennes found his funny bone to voice this part.""Heard you had a spot of rabbit bother what what?""Wallace is smitten with the lady and perplexed by the rabbit uprising.""They must be breeding like . . .""Quick as you can say ""Im crackers about cheese"" Wallace has found a solution -- rabbit rehab. He resolves to use this brain-scrubbing gadget hes been trying out on himself to brainwash the little fellows teach them to ""Just say no -- to carrots cabbage and cauliflower""Naturally that backfires. Next thing you know something is burrowing subway-sized tunnels from garden to garden leaving the town cleaned out like a Winn-Dixie before a hurricane.The vicar blames the towns fertilizer fetish. Thats no mere rabbit or even a man committing all that cabbage carnage.""Does a man have teeth the size of ax blades? We have brought a terrible judgment upon ourselves""Will Wallace amp; Gromit -- OK Gromit because hes the smart one forever pulling Wallaces cheese out of the fire -- solve the mystery? Or will Victor have the last shot?""You can hop but you cant hide""The humor is familiar to anybody who watches ancient Britcoms on PBS or BBC America. Its finding whats funny in reliably British ""types"" those stiff-upper folks for whom ""Put the kettle on"" is a national mantra. Theyre dotty hobbyists manic Miss Marple readers tinkerers dog lovers and darned funny in a perfectly G-rated way.The characters are rendered in the soft cuddly lines that Plasticine demands every one with pop-eyes and bad overbites. The script and sight gags coat the whole film in a warm grin of recognition. This is an homage to those old British Hammer horror films of the 1950s and 60s. Somewhere the ghost of Peter Cushing is muttering ""Were-rabbit. Why didnt we think of that?""Actor Peter Sallis does the voice of Wallace with every ounce of clueless whimsy that he can muster. Gromit just furrows his brow and reasons everything out.Truth be told at feature-film length Wamp;G get a bit winded in the third act. The movie recycles gags from earlier Wallace amp; Gromit short films but thats more of an homage too. Our heroes have a history and they build on past gadgets to come up with new ones.And the finale is a corker -- anybody who isnt tickled at the sight of legions of rabbits howling at the moon plainly hasnt had enough tea in their diet.True Gromitheads know theres only one rule in Parks fanciful clay-coated universe Dont forget the cheese.

Michael Bay for example. Hell just ask for 50 million more then cram all 100 million into an aircraft carrier and blow it up. Or Renny Harlin who might use your money to make ""Cliffhanger II"" with Sly Stallone ice-climbing again in a tank top. But your 50 million is well-spent with Nick Park. Park created two of animations most distinctive and yes lovable characters when he first shaped Wallace amp; Gromit out of clay for short films in the 1990s. Full-feature money means Park can now populate dotty Wallace and indomitable Gromits English world with vicars ladyships bounders and constables. And each new character that hops on-screen in ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" is a smashing-pumpkins delight. You know their creator even if Wallace amp; Gromit arrive as mysterious imports. Park took his stop-motion clay puppets to three Academy Awards for shorts two of them with the man-dog odd couple of Wallace amp; Gromit. He parlayed that success into one feature with ""Chicken Run"" using the same clay techniques with different characters. Meanwhile Wamp;G fans have waited 10 years for a new installment showcasing Wallaces cheese addiction Gromits long-suffering intelligence and their Rube Goldberg inventions. Blessedly ""Were-Rabbit"" is as much fun to watch as it must have been to write. Our two heroes now run a varmint-control company called ""Anti-Pesto."" They protect the fanatical vegetable growers in their shire with elaborate and humane trapping schemes. Each time Wallace gets a new client he hangs their portrait on his living room wall attached to a trip-alarm - when a rabbit enters their garden the portraits eyes light up and make that ""bwaaant-bwaaant- bwaaant"" sound heard in all cinematic war rooms. Thus we are treated to gadgets like the BunnVac 6000 which leaves the hares floating happily in a gigantic bell jar. Theres a Halloween theme here so Wallace of course will play a buck-toothed Frankenstein combining the BunnVac with his Mind-Manipulator- O-Matic and use his own brain to re-train the bunnies to hate vegetables. All becomes bolloxed quicker than you can say Wensleydale. Wallace (voiced again by Peter Sallis) unleashes an enormous voracious rabbit on the countryside just in time for the harvest competition at Lady Tottingtons (Helena Bonham Carter). With so many visual pleasures in Parks movies we must pause to appreciate the sharp writing as well. A terrified vicar laments ""By tampering with nature forcing vegetables to swell beyond their natural size we have brought judgment upon ourselves"" Park and co-director Steve Box add a slight touch of double-entendre naughtiness to the mix with Lady Tottington complaining that her caddish suitor Victor (Ralph Fiennes) has ""never shown any interest in my produce."" As it was in the Wamp;G short ""The Wrong Trousers"" the chase finale is head-spinningly fantastic. Just try to remember these are clay figures filmed on sets the size of sofas. Park and Box send up ""King Kong"" ""An American Werewolf in London"" ""Frankenstein"" ""Snoopy amp; the Red Baron"" and at least a half-dozen others Im sure I missed. Every painstaking image from earlier in the movie is paid off with interest. We can only hope Wallace amp; Gromit bring such embarrassingly large mounds of leafy cash down upon themselves that Park can make his next feature even faster.

"Silly Rabbit is expertly crafted - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Silly Rabbit is expertly crafted By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 7 2005 Theres a corner of the animation world thats forever England -- a claymation universe where every brick row house has its proud vegetable garden where modern dentistry has yet to make serious inroads and where mans best friend and intellectual superior is his dog.This is the tidy absurdist world of Nick Park creator of the Oscar-winning Wallace amp; Gromit"" shorts 2000s hit Chicken Run"" and the exquisitely daft Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" codirected with Steve Box. The new film is supposedly a kiddie movie and if you have children or can borrow some on short notice theyll certainly enjoy themselves. It takes an adult sensibility though to appreciate silliness this finely tuned. Even more than Chicken Run"" Were-Rabbit"" is a tiny plasticine masterpiece.Audiences familiar with shorts like 1993s The Wrong Trousers"" have a leg up so for newcomers Wallace (voice of Peter Sallis) is a balding bug-eyed large-toothed inventor of tinker-toy contraptions that usually take the long way around to do something quite simple. Eternally optimistic and equally dense hes the picture of gormless pluck with a cheese fetish the Monty Python gang might understand. Ah but I do love a bit of gorgonzola"" is the closest Wallace has come to a life statement and it serves.All great comic boobs need a partner and Wallace has his unspeaking dog Gromit able to express infinite gradations of dismay with a tilt of his clay brows. When Were-Rabbit"" opens the two are running a successful concern ridding local gardens of rabbits in anticipation of the upcoming Giant Vegetable Competition overseen as always by Lady Campanula Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter). With their Anti-Pesto vans BunniVac machine the heroes are able to suck up dozens of the adorably stupid little rodents per second giving Gromit more time to tend to his prize melon (he keeps it under an electric blanket set on cozy"").Unable to leave well enough alone and flustered by the attentions of Lady T. Wallace sets out to cure the bunnies once and for all hooking his experimental thought-wave machine to the BunniVac for some harmless brain manipulation thats all."" In short order a hulking monster lepus is stalking the neighborhood gardens ravishing the turnips and terrifying the vicar.Before certain complications are revealed Wallace hopes to catch the Were-Rabbit by peaceful means while Lady Tottingtons fortune-hunting gentleman friend Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes) has a blunderbuss and aims to use it. The Lady herself is torn -- Victor hasnt shown any interest in my produce"" she sighs after showing Wallace to her secret garden high in Tottington Manor -- and Bonham Carter gets the characters twee horsey cadences just right. Between this and Corpse Bride"" the actress is showing more animation than she has in years.Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" gets increasingly manic as it goes riffing on everything from King Kong"" to Harvey"" to Snoopy vs. the Red Baron"" and its not above putting a cotton-candy B-52s bouffant hairdo on its villain to get a laugh. More than anything though the movies infused with Parks eye for the droll for naughty blink-and-youll-miss-them sight gags (keep a lookout for the cardboard box Wallace wears toward the end) and the biggest joke of all for the ingrained British desire to not make a fuss. Its hard to keep a stiff upper lip when youre facing down an 800-stone rabbit.Those lips are made of clay of course -- ropy red outlines any kid could make with enough Play-Doh. Park and his creative team spent five years making Curse"" though and it shows in each smudgy painstakingly crafted detail. What does it say when this the stop-motion puppetry of Corpse Bride"" and Hayao Miyazakis hand-drawn Howls Moving Castle"" have provided the best and richest animated experiences of the year?

"Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wallace-gromit-the-curse-of-the-were-rabbit ) Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli After a 10-year absence Aardman Animations foundation characters Wallace amp; Gromit have returned. The clay man and his dog who were featured in three animated shorts between 1989 and 1995 were left out in the cold when Nick Park and his crew made their feature-length debut with 2000s acclaimed Chicken Run. At the time fans pondered Wallace amp; Gromits fate and Park was quick to reassure them that the dynamic duo would be front-and-center for his next movie. Five years later (it takes a long time to make these stop-motion films) Park has kept his word. Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit gives mainstream audiences their first opportunity to meet the pliable characters with a cult following. Wallace (voice of Peter Sallis) is a cheese-loving chatty inventor living in a small village in rural Great Britain. His lone companion is his impossibly intelligent but always silent canine Gromit. When The Curse of the Were-Rabbit opens these two have formed a PETA-friendly animal removal service called ""Anti-Pesto."" When rabbits threaten garden vegetables in come Wallace amp; Gromit (armed with a giant vacuum cleaner) to save the day. Its their job to ensure that everyones carrots squashes peppers and melons are ready for Lady Tottingtons (Helena Bonham-Carter) annual Giant Vegetable Contest. However just when Wallace and Gromit appear to have everything under control there is a new arrival - a fearsome brute of a creature with an appetite to match its monstrous size. It is a were-rabbit and no one is sure how to deal with it. Wallace and Gromit devise a trap. Lady Tottingtons would-be husband Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes) loads his gun with gold bullets (the only thing that will kill a were-rabbit) and the rest of the townspeople arm themselves with pitchforks and shovels from the Mob Supply Store. British humor isnt like American humor. The emphasis is more on wit and slapstick and those qualities feature heavily in Wallace amp; Gromit. The film offers a bounty of chuckles but not many belly-laughs. Thats its nature. In an attempt to fit in with mainstream animated fare Park has made a few minor adjustments. An obvious one is the inclusion of double entendres. We have an Austin Powers-inspired scene with a pair of melons and an amusing note (""May contain nuts"") on the side of a carefully positioned crate. But there are no major compromises. Wallace amp; Gromit looks like an 85-minute version of Wallace amp; Gromit not the latest chapter of the Shrek saga. In terms of plotting and character development Wallace amp; Gromit falls a hairs breadth short of Chicken Run. This episodic movie feels more like several shorts cobbled together than a cohesive whole. And the first 20 (or so) minutes provides a newcomers guide to the main characters essentially re-creating moments from the earlier shorts. These arent necessarily bad things but theyre worth pointing out. The tone although darker than that of the average American animated movie is still perfectly suitable for family viewing. However its my guess that Wallace amp; Gromit will develop a stronger following among older viewers (as opposed to children). One wonders if kids will ""get it."" For those who think 3-D digital animation looks too perfect the style of Wallace amp; Gromit offers a welcome change. CGI is used sparingly; most of this movie was put together in an old-fashioned way - by moving the clay figurines fractionally for each frame. Its the same process that was used in classics like King Kong. Wallace amp; Gromit looks wonderful - a surreal fantasyland where dogs may not speak but outthink their human compatriots. Dont let the apparent primitiveness of the animation fool you - Wallace amp; Gromit is as smooth and pleasing to the eye as any computer generated imagery. The latest trend in animated movies is to assemble a vocal cast comprised of big-name stars. This can be a double-edged sword. While ""star appeal"" can boost box-office receipts and elevate a movies visibility it can be distracting. Park doesnt rely on prominent names. Wallace is as always voiced by Peter Sallis. (Gromit doesnt speak.) Helena Bonham-Carter (in her second animated outing of the year) and Ralph Fiennes are recognizable ""guest stars"" but unless you know about their participation beforehand its unlikely that youll recognize them. Fiennes in particular has disguised his voice. Wallace amp; Gromit has a lot of good-natured fun lampooning conventions from old horror movies (both those from Universal and Hammer). A scene where lightning punctuates every pronouncement is one of many examples. Theres also an extended homage to King Kong thats apropos when you consider that both movies use the same special effects technology. Wallace amp; Gromit is one of the better offerings to be found in a year that has seen a drop-off in the quality of animated films. Along with Corpse Bride (also filmed using stop-motion) its one of 2005s few non-live action feature capable of engaging all members of the family.

A Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit Genre Animation; Starring Helena Bonham Carter Ralph Fiennes; Director Steve Box Nick Park; Author Bob Baker Steve Box Nick Park; Release Date Wide 10/07/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 85 Posted August 8 2007 -- 1200 AM EDT I hadnt realized just how hungry I had been for a lovely bit of cheese -- I mean for a tasty chunk of Nick Park art and philosophy -- until the familiar bouncy theme music that announces the arrival of Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit got me salivating. Here in the nick of time is a cheeky pip-pip and hip-hip-hooray for the British virtues of decency class consciousness and well-tended garden vegetables Finally we have news of the daft Wensleydale-loving clay-animated English inventor Wallace and his resourceful long-suffering canine companion Gromit last seen on the big screen a decade ago in the Oscar-winning short A Close Shave. In their first feature-length adventure the duo operate a profitable pest-control business win the affection of a trilling noblewoman outwit the schemes of a twitty upper-class gent and defeat a ravaging mutant beast come to wreak havoc on the townsfolks gardens in scenes that bear no small semblance to those in Universal horror classics. In short the symbiotic pair generally display the absurd virtues of plucky Englishness and extravagant Laurel-and-Hardy luck in the face of chaos that have made Wamp;G such feet-of-clay heroes for 16 years and have put the Aardman Animation chaps on the map. The challenge this time for Park and his codirector Steve Box is to give fans what weve been waiting for while bringing newcomers to the Wamp;G household up to date on the couples domestic partnership. Mission Accomplished. It takes but a few scenes of morning routine in which the two are roused dressed and fed via a series of Rube Goldberg-inspired gizmos to establish that Wallace (voiced to perfection as ever by Peter Sallis) is the inventor but not necessarily the smarter of the two and that the silent Gromit (with infinitely expressive eyes that communicate a thousand shades of ""heaven help me"" and ""heres another fine mess youve gotten us into"") is actually the brains in the family. Then its off to the fair or at least to the days leading up to the annual Giant Vegetable Competition days in which the garden-proud local populace retains Wamp;Gs ""Anti-Pesto"" services to deal humanely with any rabbits that may threaten the well-being of competition veggies. (Wallaces innovative Bun-Vac 6000 painlessly sucks the little hoppers up into a holding vat then blows them into pens at the proprietors home to become supervised guests.) But the good work they do for grand Lady Tottington (voiced with a knack for being an animated fancy lady by Helena Bonham Carter) doesnt sit well with Totties pompous scheming suitor Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes letting rip with lusty glee) -- hed much rather blast the varmints -- and soon Victor has his sights on shutting down the Wamp;G operation too. The movie rollicks with visual slapstick puns and drive-by joke-cluster bombs that fall on young and adult viewers alike with such good aim (in the Chicken Run style which is highest praise indeed) that its easy to forget that it took Park Box and their devoted team five labor-intensive years to move these clay townspeople and bunnies and lycanthropes with stop-motion precision. (The thumbprints intentionally left on the subjects are marks of monomaniacal love.) For all the obsession required by the technical demands of this joyous hand-made film man dog and human handlers never appear to break a sweat. The Curse of the Were-Rabbit bestows generous blessings on all thats good in Englishness in moviedom and of course in cheese.

As quintessentially British in flavor as a wedge of Wensleydale ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" reps the long-awaited feature outing for helmer Nick Parks Plasticine pals here up against a mutant rabbit. Although DreamWorks slightly coarsening fingerprints are visible in places Park and co-helmer Steve Box stay faithful to the cozy core ingredients that made the clay duos kudo-reaping shorts and Parks previous pic ""Chicken Run"" so well loved. ""Curse"" delivers a wholesome morsel happily not too cheesy that families will nibble on as a treat this autumn before making a real meal of it on ancillary. First introduced in Parks film school final project ""A Grand Day Out"" (which was nominated for an Oscar) and met again in the follow-up ""The Wrong Trousers"" (which won an Oscar) Wallace (voiced by veteran thesp Peter Sallis) and Gromit (who never speaks) are one man and his dog respectively. Living in a tidy terraced house in a suburban corner of Northern England that looks stranded somewhere in the 1940s the two take trips to the moon (in ""Out"") and confrontations with larcenous penguins (in ""Trousers"") in their stride. An archetypal chalk-and-cheese double act dairy product-loving Wallace and his smarter pooch Gromit (arguably as great a silent comedian as Jacques Tati or even Buster Keaton) have a passion for building Heath Robinson-style labor-saving devices. Here theyve put their mechanical talents to work to build a security company called Anti-Pesto that patrols via remote control the backyard plots of their gardening-mad town. The annual giant vegetable competition is approaching and Wallace and Gromit are kept busy humanely extracting foliage-fancying rabbits from the ground with their Bun-Vac 6000. (They keep the mischievous rabbits afterward as pets.) When Wallace with Gromits help successfully fixes the lapine woes of pretty local toff Lady Tottington (Helena Bonham Carter on her second animated outing this year after ""Corpse Bride"") winning her regard in the process he attracts the jealous eye of scheming Victor Quartermaine (Ralph Fiennes). Quartermaine thinks shooting is a better method of pest control and wants Lady ""Totty"" for his bride. Wallace ends up making more trouble for everyone when he hooks the Bun-Vac up to his latest invention the Mind-O-Matic hoping to brain-wash the rabbits into not wanting to eat vegetables at all. The experiment backfires and soon a giant ""were-rabbit"" -- seen in classic horror movie-style only in glimpses and shadow outline at first -- starts ravaging the towns gardens turning the placid locals into an angry mob. This first third somewhat reprises in bigger-budget form the same shticks from Parks earlier shorts (such as the complicated contraptions that put Wallace in his trademark trousers and knitted vest for breakfast) but it helps bring viewers new to the duo up to speed with their world. Similarly pics grand finale at the vegetable fete although featuring entirely original slapstick sight gags and quite excitingly assembled indeed feels as if its sticking to the template laid down at the end of ""Trousers"" which was refined further in ""Chicken Run."" Nevertheless all the crisply paced stuff in between these bookends is consistently charming. Park and his usual screenwriting collaborator Bob Bakers taste for poky understated humor (Wallaces typical reaction to catastrophe is to moan softly ""Oh dear"") meshes well with Mark Burton co-scribe for DreamWorks ""Madagascar"" who might be supposed to be responsible for pics broader comic touches such as a tired gag that places a pair of melons right in front of Tottys breasts for an ""Austin Powers""-style double entendre. Many of the knowing pun-tastic ""Shrek""-lite jokes lurking in the background here feel self-consciously aimed at tickling grownups funny bones such as a row of books hiding Wallaces secret cheese store with titles like ""East of Edam"" and ""Grated Expectations."" Another big wink comes when a snatch of Art Garfunkels song ""Bright Eyes"" the theme for rabbit-themed toon ""Watership Down"" is heard on a car stereo. Overall this feels a smidge less genuinely innocent than the original Aardman shorts. Where ""Curse"" really shines and also stays true to its roots is in the animation department. Character design is faithful to the endearingly lumpy look with thumbprints deliberately left unsmoothed thats become shingle Aardman and Parks trademark. The sparing but wonderfully expressive work put into Gromits looks and gestures is simply bravura stuff. Merchandisers affiliated with the franchise should be delighted. Animation team makes the painstaking job of individually moving characters in big crowd scenes look effortless even with pics tens of rabbit extras. Deploying CGI in subtle but strategic way latter warren of critters is seen spinning in the Bun-Vac an effect done in an entirely different medium that is kept from looking too incongruous with the jerkier stop-motion animation by inserting tiny stutters in the movement. Camerawork will likewise impress animation geeks with tricky low tracks through foliage in the action scenes. Lighting is cleverly deployed to make figures pop out more even in night scenes. The rest of the production design underscores retro vibe while offering more pleasingly rough textures in hair and clothes that will prove particularly attractive to underage viewers who will sit mesmerized through pics trim running time. For the record onscreen title of print caught was ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" which appeared in the wake of portraits of the two leading characters.
