An election-year chapter of the gruesome action series paints a happier picture of democracy than the real world Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics 2016 Elections 2016 Presidential Campaign 2016 presidential election Donald Trump Editors Picks Elections 2016 elizabeth mitchell James DeMonaco Movies Our Picks Movies the purge The Purge Election Year Entertainment News Politics News Donald Trump; ""The Purge Election Year"" (Credit AP/Universal Pictures) There are two versions of an election year available at the moment one real and one fictional. One of them is a ludicrous and idiotic narrative about race and class in America full of unbelievable characters and implausible plot twists anchored in the naive belief that popular revolt through the ballot box can bring down a corrupt oligarchy. The other one is a movie.Yeah thats a joke and all -- but this entire year has been a massive practical joke inflicted on America and the world by God or the Three Fates or the tumbling dice of the universe. Im entirely serious when I say that ""The Purge Election Year"" which is both a violent action sequel and a mind-numbingly obvious political allegory presents a more idealistic vision of democracy than any currently available in the so-called real world of Trump and Brexit and post-partisan meltdown. Its a story of sacrifice and heroism a story of redemption and renewal and cross-racial working-class solidarity. Its a story about the American people finally reclaiming their destiny from the tiny clique of gated-community wealthocrats who run everything. Oh and its also a story about psychotic Catholic schoolgirls with chainsaws and homicidal Russian tourists in Abe Lincoln costumes. Im not saying that like its a bad thing.Its not quite accurate to say that the rise of Donald Trump very shortly after writer-director James DeMonaco began churning out the ""Purge"" movies (the first one was released in the summer of 2013 and ""The Purge Anarchy"" came a year later) is a case of life imitating art. First of all that assumes that Trump represents ""life"" and that the ""Purge"" movies are ""art."" No hold on because thats not just a gag line. Close down your computer drink a glass of cold water look out the window for a minute and then ask yourself How sure am I that any of this is really happening? A New York con man with a long history of business failures and bankruptcies who has a weird comb-over and acid-washed skin is about to become the Republican presidential nominee? It just doesnt pass the smell test. Either I fell through a black hole into another universe or I ate those shrooms that have been in my best friends freezer since 1998 or we have entered a baleful new phase in widespread public confusion between reality and media spectacle.One possibility we cant rule out is that ""The Purge Election Year"" and other things we perceive as fiction are actually reality. Are we like the prisoners in Platos cave only able to see the shadows cast by people and things in the real world but unable to see it directly? Neil deGrasse Tyson recently hosted a debate at the American Museum of Natural History on the proposition that our universe is actually a computer simulation designed by a vastly more intelligent species. Some scientists are willing to treat that idea seriously largely because there is no way to disprove it but also because (like belief in divine creation) it explains away any number of real or possible anomalies. I kind of like that idea and kind of dont but if the alien engineers changed the parameters of the simulation to make Trump possible then they are some cruel bastards.Another way of putting it that avoids pinning the blame on ""Matrix""-like overlords is that the computer simulation is one we created ourselves. As the English science fiction prophet J.G. Ballard once put it the alien planet is Earth. We have turned the incomprehensible and endlessly complicated real world into a construct we can understand like a cable drama or an offshoot of the Marvel universe. We have moved through progressive states of dissociation until we now relate to the real world as if it were not real and as if we were not real either. It has been said that Trump resembles a Marvel supervillain (well said by me anyway) but hes really more like a parody-president from a 1986 underground comic or from Mike Judges ""Idiocracy."" (Trumps blustery goofus demeanor where youre never sure whether hes really mad about something or just winding you up would make him a great host for ""Ow My Balls"")We may have buyers remorse at the belated realization that the world is not just TV and the Internet and that our actions have consequences In one recent survey a majority of Republican voters said they wished someone other than Trump were the nominee. Barely a week after the Brexit referendum 7 percent of those who voted ""Leave"" told pollsters they regretted their decision which would have been more than enough to alter the outcome had they voted for vaguely grownup reasons instead of voting for ""Ow My Balls"" But any consciousness that the world is not a video game and reality is not a reality show is intermittent at best and kind of a bummer. It goes away again after a while.In 2016 we have followed the internal logic of our culture to its extreme and rewritten ourselves as bit players in a movie of our own devising one that is not necessarily more convincing than ""The Purge Election Year"" but is likely to have unhappy consequences for real people we will never meet. That brings me to the end of a tangent that went a pretty long way from the crazy Catholic girls in the slutty prom-queen outfits. (If youre going out to commit mass murder on the gruesome night of carnival when nothing is illegal it makes sense to dress like a performer in a barely-legal porn video. I guess?) But it wasnt really a tangent and anyway were back. You Might Also Like If for some inexplicable reason you missed DeMonacos first two ""Purge"" movies I guess I just explained the premise. But it deserves some elaboration because all three movies are barely disguised fairytales about contemporary America. Theyre about institutional racism and predatory financial practices and how a tiny oligarchic elite can rule everyone else through the pretense of democracy and the illusion of freedom. This one is even about a sensible blonde lady whose presidential campaign depends on African-American support although Im going to guess that part is a hilarious accident.If you do the math ""The Purge Election Year"" is presumably set in the year 2032 but DeMonaco doesnt even bother to make it look like anybodys idea of the future. Some years earlier -- right now basically -- a bunch of rich white dudes who called themselves the New Founding Fathers staged a coup and replaced the old United States with a neo-fascist state that has ensured full employment and near-zero crime through the annual ritual of the Purge. Every year at the spring equinox (a nice touch) all forms of crime and mayhem are legal for one night from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m. and the cops firefighters and paramedics wont show up no matter what happens. If youre about to crack a joke about how thats every night in Detroit skip it -- we wore those out when the first movie was released in 2013.Theres no doubt that DeMonaco has milked the sadistic and prurient possibilities of this premise pretty hard in all three installments The Manhattan preview audience with whom I watched ""Election Year"" went nuts for the scene when the slutty prom queens get mowed down by a bad-ass black woman in an armor-plated ambulance. But like most ""exploitation movies"" the ""Purge"" franchise is deeply moralistic at heart. Just below the surface the Purge is a mechanism for culling the surplus population If a few middle-class families are terrorized by home invasions (as in the first movie) those most likely to fall victim to goons or gangs or ""murder tourists"" are those too weak to defend themselves the poorest of the poor the homeless the mentally ill undocumented immigrants and the elderly. So its basically Halloween meets the Holocaust configured as a way to vent your frustration on whomever you hate -- Muslims Jews gays guys who wear Dockers; its all good -- and ensure a harmonious and prosperous society the rest of the year. Its about making America great again pretty much. The only thing Donald Trump wouldnt like about that idea is that he didnt think of it first and the thing DeMonaco must think looking at the Trump campaign is that the unctuous theocratic president played in the movie by Kyle Secor (onetime star of ""Homicide Life on the Street"") isnt nearly as terrifying or as nonsensical as the real thing.As my movie-reviewing guru Joe Bob Briggs -- from whom I learned everything I know except that I forgot it again -- would say at this point theres an awful lot of plot in ""The Purge Election Year"" cluttering up the story. The idealistic blonde senator running for president on a promise to end the Purge (played by Elizabeth Mitchell of TVs ""Lost"" and ""Revolution"") lost her family to a Purger lunatic years earlier and has entrusted her Purge Night safety to former cop Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) a returning character from ""Anarchy."" Also returning is Edwin Hodge as an anti-Purge resistance fighter previously known as ""the Stranger"" who now gets a name and a Black Panther-esque paramilitary movement.Throw in the virtuous black small-business owner played by Mykelti Williamson his Mexican immigrant sidekick (Joseph Julian Soria) and the aforementioned ambulance-driving shotgun-wielding female badass (Betty Gabriel) and this whole movie is like a Coalition of the Willing -- willing to kick Donald Trumps ass. Even when you factor in the deranged porn girls and the episodes of pointless and gruesome violence under normal circumstances I would say that ""The Purge Election Year"" is stupider than real-world politics but somehow purer in spirit. Since nothing about this year is normal and nothing could possibly be stupider than the 2016 election Ill stick with the premise that this B-minus dystopian action flick portrays a better world and we can only wish we lived there instead of here.

James DeMonaco creator of The Purge (2013) must be the happiest man in America right about now given the confrontational mess our Presidential campaign season has become. In The Purge Election Year (the third in his dystopian film series) the writer-director both channels and takes advantage of the ideological rage and frustration that has fueled the current political scene granting this sequel an extra bit of blunt force. The focus this time is on a female senator and Presidential candidate (ahem) whose platform is built on ending the Purge the annual 12-hour period when all crime (especially murder) is legal. Election Year makes explicit what the previous films only hinted at The Purge has been designed by the all-white ruling cabal--the New Founding Fathers of America--to whittle down the poor nonwhite masses. Thus Sen. Charlie Roan (Losts Elizabeth Mitchell) after surviving an NFFA assassination attempt goes on the run through the violent streets of Washington D.C. with her head of security (Frank Grillo returning from 2014s The Purge Anarchy). Theyre helped out by a group of working-class African- and Mexican-American citizens led by deli owner Joe (Mykelti Williamson). The action is largely routine and the dialogue rarely more than functional but DeMonaco marshalling the franchises best production values yet shrewdly taps into the angry zeitgeist; his vision of an America where the citizens are encouraged to express their basest emotions is more relevant than ever. While theres no explicit Donald Trump analog the climactic sequence where the filmmaker really hits his stride offers a scary glimpse of radical conservatism taken to its logical extreme. The NFFA doesnt want to build a wall to keep out undesirables but rather to exterminate those already here and Election Years extrapolations of contemporary anxiety lend an urgency to its run-and-gun scenario.

"Purge The Election Year | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; purge-the-election-year ) Purge The Election Year (France/U.S. 2016) July 01 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Purge Election Year represents writer/director James DeMonacos attempt to squeeze one more movie out of a premise that has run dry. The first movie of the series offered little more than The Concept - an alternate universe tale that took a little from The Twilight Zone a little from Star Trek (specifically ""Return of the Archons"") and a little from 80s slasher films and cobbled them altogether. The Purge Anarchy did some moderately interesting things with this dysfunctional world and approached respectability. Election Year is a big step backward and illustrates that not only have the ideas underlying the would-be franchise worn out their welcome but DeMonaco isnt really sure where to go with this. The film clearly wants to be more than just a run-of-the-mill horror-thriller but the allegorical aspects are half-baked and the attempts to mimic Kubricks A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut feel more like campy satire than an homage. What is ""The Purge""? For those who havent seen the previous installments heres a primer its a social policy enacted by the ""New Founding Fathers"" that has resulted in great prosperity for Americas wealthiest citizens but at a cost. Every March 22 for 12 hours criminal law is suspended. People can do whatever they want even murder without fear of legal consequences. Its a time when they can either give freedom to their ""inner beast"" or hunker down in fortified homes and ride it out. This time around an exemption for government officials has been lifted thereby allowing politicians to orchestrate the assassinations of their rivals. Election Year is a direct sequel to Anarchy transpiring two years later and bringing back Sergeant Leo Barnes. Actor Frank Grillo looks thoroughly bored with the proceedings. His one-note performance transforms this character from a tough-as-nails protagonist into a largely irrelevant sidekick. Its hard to root for Leo because hes so dour and unfriendly. His job is to protect progressive Presidential candidate Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) and he doesnt do a very good job of it. In short order he has been shot and with a bullet in his left shoulder is ushering her through the city streets on Purge Night. If his primary characteristic is unfriendliness his secondary one is incompetence. Theres a subplot about a shopkeeper (Mykelti Williamson) who gets up on the roof with a gun to protect his deli from looters. Of course this plot thread intersects with Charlie and Leos. Theres a lot of running around and hiding from costumed lunatics who act like Clockwork Orange rejects. Its not hard to envision how better direction might have turned some of these scenes into surrealistic nightmares but DeMonaco hews too close to horror-thriller tropes to allow this to happen. Every time hes about to do something potentially artistic he remembers that his audience cares primarily about the body count and reverts to form. By calling the movie Election Year and releasing it amidst the bizarre cage match between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton the third Purge movie screams ""allegory"" with a stridency that the marketing campaign has embraced. Unfortunately its ""political commentary"" offers nothing beyond what has been in place since the first installment - allusions to a corrupt government ruled by Orwellian principles and determined to stamp out poverty by removing the impoverished. The script was written too early to function as a take-down of Trump - theres no avatar of the Republican nominee and his most controversial policies arent mentioned. And only someone in a fever dream would see the ultra-idealistic Charlie as a stand-in for Hilary. Those who see this as a cautionary tale dont have a strong grip on reality. Election Year is saturated by contradictions with the desire to inject social commentary into an exploitation film creating an inherent conflict. Nowhere is this more evident than about how DeMonaco treats guns. The none-too-subtle message is anti-gun but its awash in imagery and rah-rah story beats that fetishize firearms and their use to mow down a room full of bad guys. The films anti-American rhetoric paints with broad strokes that result in a narrative so absurdly artificial as to defy credulity. Yes I know alternate universe stories require a hefty helping of the quality referred to as ""suspension of disbelief"" but this asks too much of a thoughtful viewer. Weve gone down the rabbit hole and come out in a land where the laws of logic and sanity have been suspended. Distilled to its essentials The Purge Election Year represents a borderline-competent return to a world of madness and mayhem where the goal is to survive the night by any means possible. It follows the mandate of delivering more of the same to keep the franchise going and any attempts by DeMonaco to expand the canvas arent successful. The central premise probably isnt long enough in the tooth yet to turn off fans but theres little here to attract or interest anyone who isnt already on board The Purge bandwagon.

By the time Purge Anarchy rolled around a year later the series had transformed into an agitprop extravaganza about our obsession with violence Anarchy was a blood-soaked smorgasbord of 21st-century American neuroses with religious nuts financial crooks and race-inflected-class warfare all in a world where rich society doyennes salivated over gun models as if they were fine wines.This embrace of a social conscience wasnt opportunistic exactly; the Rod Serling-esque concept of a society sanctioned to go mad was always there. But DeMonaco clearly understood what made this series singular. So now the third film The Purge Election Year consciously foregrounds what once was blunt subtext Its a movie about how the Purge is wrong wrong wrong. As such it packs less of a punch; the writer/director has a lot to say but this neo-grindhouse framework isnt built for complexity. Still the film is just bonkers enough to work.Film Details The Purge Election Year RatingR GenreSuspense/Thriller Running Time105 min. Showing Today In8 Theaters More Info Trailer At the center of the new tale is Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) a presidential candidate who wants to end the tradition of Purge Night. (Her whole family was massacred some years ago which is why she entered politics in the first place.) Running against the countrys New Founding Fathers -- the sneering array of scotch-swilling vampiric and pious old white men who instituted the Purge in the first place in a not-so-veiled effort at population control -- she is perhaps needless to say a marked woman. Luckily she has trusty Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) the ass-kicking antihero of Purge Anarchy handling security for her.As the annual orgy of bloodletting begins the restrictions against killing high-level government officials are unexpectedly lifted rendering Charlie fair game. After one brutal assassination attempt she and Leo find themselves out in the streets where they hide out with wise-cracking bodega owner Joe (Mykelti Williamson) who is trying to protect his store against a group of glassy-eyed bloodthirsty...um schoolgirls. But like theyre really crazy really mean schoolgirls and they have bedazzled AK-47s and cars tricked out with Christmas lights and they playfully slap each others butts with flyswatters.As in the previous film theres a scrappy underground anti-Purge movement this time led by charismatic guerrilla leader Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge). Joe the senator Leo and Dante soon begin to collaborate; joining them is a tough-as-nails former street warrior named Laney Rucker (nicknamed ""La Pequena Muerte"") who now drives a triage van on Purge Night shepherding the wounded and abandoned to safety. EXPAND Grillo/Mitchell 16 Courtesy Universal Pictures Its telling of course that most of the folks opposing the Purge are African-American or Hispanic and that the powers that be are all lily-white. Theres nothing understated about the movies politics The New Founding Fathers shock troops wear uniforms festooned with white-power patches and Confederate flags; their leader has swastika tattoos. Were told at one point that the Purge mainly serves to kill off the poor and line the pockets of the NRA. In TV news footage showing foreign tourists coming to the U.S. for ""murder tourism"" one South African white guy starts yelling at the camera in Afrikaans. The only thing missing is a ""Make America Great Hat"" but who knows maybe I just missed it amid all the gunfire and explosions.Unsubtle politics dont equal clear politics of course. But as with other Purge movies Election Year knows that its having its cake and eating it too luxuriating in the violence while explicitly denouncing it. In Anarchy this two-facedness worked well because the film functioned mostly as an episodic Dante-esque journey through a carnival of horrors and also because Leo himself was out to purge -- DeMonaco understood the base appeal of revenge against those whove wronged you and he used that to toy with our allegiances.This time however the director seems to hold Purge Night at a distance He presents us with plenty of ghoulish and bizarre sights not to mention gruesome violence. But it all feels like its being played for maximum strangeness thus lessening its visceral impact. By contrast the sights and sounds of the earlier films felt like monsters from our collective id disturbingly familiar and compelling. Ironically DeMonaco is releasing this new one into a real-life political environment of unnerving tension and gonzo theatricality -- but in some weird way the previous films felt more prescient than this new one.If The Purge Election Year is ultimately still engaging its largely because of the irresistibility of the basic concept itself. But this new movie also makes a pretty good case for why the series should end here Things have not only come to their logical conclusion but you get the curious sense that the filmmakers have run out of ideas.

Frank Grillo and Elizabeth Mitchell star in The Purge Election Year in which a U.S. sentaor tries to stay alive during a 12-hour violent purge. Latest film in Purge franchise achieves apex of idiocy Add to ... JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 01 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jul. 12 2016 128PM EDT Comments AA Directed by James DeMonaco Written by James DeMonaco Starring Frank Grillo Elizabeth Mitchell and Mykelti Williamson Classification 14A Genre horror Country USA Language English The problem with the Purge films is that they feel like theyre beta-testing their own premise.Let me explain.Beginning in 2013 with the micro-budget The Purge a film distinguished by its ghastly premise and a nice late-period genre-hack performance by Ethan Hawke and continuing through 2014s The Purge Anarchy and now this new one this franchise delights in images of excessive cartoonish aestheticized violence. At the same time its ostensible message is that excessive cartoonish aestheticized violence is bad and wrong and that we should feel bad about indulging it. The Purge is a social-science-fiction film series in which America has reduced crime and all but eliminated a costly social safety net with an annual celebration in which all crime - including murder - is legal for 12 hours. Yet its heroes are those who conscientiously resist or fight back against the grisly holiday. It is in a word incoherent.It would be one thing to bait the viewers blood lust and then punish them for it. But the films command an audience thats enchanted by its displays of blood-drenched yahoos in kooky masks satisfying their barely repressed psychopathy. Judging by the series not-unremarkable box office returns and the cackling and clapping gallery at the recent midtown Toronto press screening such a viewer is in no short supply. The problem with the Purge films is they feel like theyre made for people who would actually take part in the purge.Election Years token objector is Senator Charlene Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) a presidential hopeful campaigning on a pledge to end the perennial purge by appealing to as she puts it (copping Abraham Lincolns old chestnut) ""the better angels"" of Americas nature. Shes a nuisance to films governing body of elites the New Founding Fathers of America (NFAA) who use the auspices of the purge to have her eliminated by a squad of elite force neo-Nazis their dark military garb festooned with swastikas and Confederate flag patches.The Senator is aided in her 12-hour ticking-clock survival plot by her security chief played by Frank Grillo. Grillo is supposedly reprising his role from the previous film in a rare bit of overarching franchise continuity but he might as well be a new character. His cookie-cutter hardass barely registers onscreen thanks in large part to Grillo himself being one of the most unremarkable third-string actors currently working in Hollywood. From his used-car salesman name to his boring good looks - Grillo is handsome but in the uninspired way a male model stuffed near the back of a sports jacket catalogue is technically matter-of-factly handsome - hes an utterly charmless performer with little to do but grunt through a string of abysmally shot shoot-em-up sequences.The two are also accompanied by a gaggle of lower-class black and Latino Washington residents. The fates of the haves and have-nots drawn together by the looming threat of purge night extinction they hustle through various seedy dimly lit backdrops before falling in with a radical sect aiming to take out the NFAA and ensure the Senators election to the broken nations highest office.Its here that the generalized ideological intelligibility of the Purge films achieves the apex of idiocy. Watching Mitchells white saviour politician lecture a black radical leader (Edwin Hodge) on the hypocrisy of revolutionary violence isnt just stupid and tasteless - its physically uncomfortable. (And especially because Senator Roan and co. engage in all kinds of wanton murderousness political and otherwise in spite of such screeching protestations.)The ultimate putrid irony of the Purge franchise doesnt lie in its nonsensical take on Americas culture of violence. Or even in the way it flirts with notions of institutionalized racism only to cement hackneyed racial caricature.Its in the way it pretends to challenge the viewers belief in the idea of America and in the democratic system itself only to turn on its heel and totally restore faith in those splintered ideas running a battered and bloody but not-much-worse-for-wear star spangled banner up the flagpole and saluting it without anything like humour irony or even contempt to temper the patriotic bluster.The problem with the Purge films is that the better angels always prevail - a thesis thats not so much speculative sci-fi or social satire as aspirational high fantasy.

Short / Universal Pictures)Not smart enough to be satire not corny enough to be camp and not twisted enough to be depraved ""The Purge Election Year"" is another letdown from the ""Purge"" series.There remains potential in the ""Purge"" premise -- all crime is legal for one night as a way for America to annually cleanse all of its pent-up rage -- but its again squandered as is the election year tie-in. Writer-director James DeMonaco could have had a ball by drawing parallels to our election cycle but he avoids making connections to current events. Hes served a big juicy meatball of a pitch but hes too timid to take a swing.Too bad. So here we are back on Purge night catching up with a few characters looking to avoid the evenings events. (""Purge"" movies never follow the Purgers only those hoping not to be Purged.)Among them are Senator Charlie Roan (""Losts"" Elizabeth Mitchell) whose family was killed in an earlier Purge and who is now a candidate for president running on a strong anti-Purge platform; Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) returning from the previous ""Purge"" movie and assigned to protect Roan; and Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) a deli owner looking to protect his store on the night in question.There are a few good bits -- a group of Purging teens rides around listening to Miley Cyrus ""Party in the USA"" while toting bedazzled machine guns; store owner Joe is price-gouged when his rates skyrocket on his ""Purge insurance"" an idea that warrants further investigation -- but mostly its more of the same from this stalled series.

(MICHELE K. SHORT / Universal Pictures)GALLERY Stalked by a killer in a Lincoln mask Frank Grillo and Elizabeth... (MICHELE K....)By Tirdad Derakhshani Staff WriterPosted July 02 2016Can you make a film that criticizes gun violence in America while also reveling in a relentless gory orgy of gun violence knife violence chain-saw violence and ax violence? Thats the plight of the Purge franchise an auteurish series of hyper-violent dystopian thrillers from writer-director James DeMonaco ( The Negotiator Skinwalkers) now in its third installment with The Purge Election Year. The premise and the basic story line are familiar Set in the near future the Purge movies concern an America where once a year for 12 hours citizens get to let off steam by committing any crime - including murder - without fear of prosecution. Its a nifty little law that saves the nation health-care and welfare costs Since rich folks can protect themselves the victims tend to be the poor the weak and the marginalized. Each film stages a gladiatorial battle pitting a ragtag group of working-class characters usually of color against the gray white men who run the country. Its not the most sophisticated social satire but the movies do tap into the growing discontent over the income gap and the prevailing sense that the rich play by a different set of rules. Frank Grillo returns as Leo Barnes a former police officer who saved a band of folks from predators in the second film. Barnes has landed a job as the security chief for U.S. senator and presidential candidate Charlene Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) the only politician in America who wants the purge law to be repealed. Needless to say her opponent Minister Edwidge Owens (Kyle Secor) has hatched a plan to assassinate her on purge night. The film costars Mykelti Williamson as Joe Dixon a struggling deli owner who teams up with friend and employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) to defend his business from the hordes. Betty Gabriel plays a neighborhood activist who uses a makeshift ambulance to help the injured.The Purge Election Year tries to show that what counts isnt firepower but compassion not egoism but community. But frankly it cant help but shoot itself in the foot The violence is too tantalizing too stylized too fetishistic - the film features killers dressed in fanciful Halloween costumes who dance and sing as they dismember people. Thats what wins out in the end. When Barnes and Dixon got around to shooting some of the villains the audience at a packed preview screening exploded in applause. It was purge night for them too.tirdadphillynews.com215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW The Purge Election Year ss (Out of four stars) y Directed by James DeMonaco.

O. SCOTTJUNE 30 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Frank Grillo and Elizabeth Mitchell star in this thriller which opens Friday. Credit Universal Pictures ""The Purge"" is a scrappy little franchise -- three movies so far -- built on a solid premise. In a dystopian future (the only kind we get these days) the American government has decreed that one night a year will be given over to lawlessness. Otherwise responsible citizens can unleash their blood lust in an orgy of mayhem without consequences.The films written and directed by James DeMonaco and produced under the Blumhouse indie-horror label are self-aware enough to know that they serve a similar function. While the stated moral may be that violence is terrible the visceral message is that its a lot of fun and Mr. DeMonaco is an able if not always terribly original painter of nightmarish sanguinary tableaus. The streets of Washington D.C. where ""The Purge Election Year"" takes place are stages for infernal scenes of ritualized chaos as tourists and teenagers dress to kill in patriotic costumes and rave-appropriate garb.This chapter wanders from horror-movie images and effects into the kind of straightforward action that shares DNA with westerns and platoon pictures of old. It is as you may infer from the movies title and other clues an election year. The New Founding Fathers the white-guy junta who initiated the purge 25 years before this film occurs have for some unstated reason moved Election Day from November to May. The Purge is in March at the height of the campaign and the New Founding Fathers anointed candidate (Kyle Secor) is facing a strong challenge from Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) who has made purge abolition her lifes cause after surviving the slaughter of her family many years before. Video Trailer The Purge Election Year A preview of the film. By UNIVERSAL PICTURES on Publish Date May 22 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed But electioneering is not really Mr. DeMonacos thing and at this point the American public might need a break so after minimal exposition (enough to orient viewers who might have missed ""The Purge"" and ""The Purge Anarchy"") the film gets down to brutal business. After a shocking (but not really) lapse in security Senator Roan and her security guy Leo (Frank Grillo) find themselves on the streets of the capital where they join forces with a band of independent purge dissidents Joe (Mykelti Williamson) who owns a small grocery store; Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) his trusted employee; and Laney (Betty Gabriel) who grew up in the neighborhood and now helps operate a clandestine ambulance service.There is also a more organized insurgency a band of rebels (their leader like Leo a returning character is played by Edwin Hodge) determined to overthrow the New Founding Fathers and end what they contend has become a cynical and merciless exercise in ""predatory capitalism."" Thats a phrase that floats above the sound of gunfire as a calling-out of the National Rifle Association. And ""Election Year"" feints toward real-world politics in other ways as well notably in how it pits a multicultural underdog coalition against a white power structure abetted by neo-Nazi mercenaries with Confederate flags and swastikas on their uniforms. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But this is not really a parable of black against white or red against blue. The contours of Mr. DeMonacos future America are a bit too lightly sketched to sustain that kind of interpretation. (It seems strange for one thing that a dictatorial conspiracy-minded group like the New Founding Fathers would allow free elections to go forward.) The first ""Purge"" movie focused on the psychological and ethical effects of the annual ritual. The second ""The Purge Anarchy"" -- the best installment so far -- explored its social dimensions and real-world implications. Its blend of astute commentary and effective carnage might have raised hopes that ""Election Year"" would turn out to be a timely and cathartic exercise in allegorical satire. It isnt quite but it goes about prosaic business pretty effectively. The spectacle of righteous violence in the face of terror is satisfying in ways that transcend (or sink beneath) politics. ""The Purge Election Year"" takes itself just seriously enough to provide the expected measure of fun -- a blend of aggression release and relief. A lot of people die but no one really gets hurt.""The Purge Election Year"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Swords axes power tools and other weapons mostly handguns and assault rifles. Running time 1 hour 43 minutes.

In this dystopian near-future the New Founding Fathers of America have instituted the contained lawlessness in order to keep crime and the population in check. The 2014 sequel ""The Purge Anarchy"" liberated audiences from the confines of a single home and let loose into the streets of murderous chaos. That films breakout star the brooding Frank Grillo an American version of a taciturn Jason Statham tough guy type is a Purge angel of sorts. His character Leo is back in ""The Purge Election Year"" which is the biggest baddest berserkest Purge so far. Writer/director James DeMonaco has written and directed all three films maintaining a consistency of tone and style including bits of humor and cartoonish weirdness among the grim dark and terrifying possibilities. Related List 20 greatest movie villains of all time The films distributors have utilized pitch-perfect marketing for our own current rocky election year (a sticker reading ""I Purged""; the tagline ""Keep America Great"") and the film itself reflects the historic nomination of Hillary Clinton with a blonde upstart presidential candidate Sen. Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) fighting against the NFFA establishment. Shes running on an anti-Purge platform arguing that it unjustly wipes out the lower-class population who are unable to afford the secure fortresses of the rich while the NRA and insurance companies reap the profits. It seems so terrifyingly possible because the economic motivations and logical leaps that lead to ritual slaughter seem rather straightforward. Leo now serves as Charlies protective Secret Service agent and is a Purge angel once again when they find themselves outside on Purge Night pursued by neo-Nazi special forces. There are several breakout stars alongside Leo in ""Election Year"" veteran actor Mykelti Williamson as Joe a warm deli owner and Betty Gabriel as a no-nonsense reformed purger by the nickname of ""Pequena Muerte"" (Little Death). The wacko Halloween-on-steroids style of the trilogy is amplified in ""Election Year."" Some of the set pieces seem simply provocative rushing by in morbid vignettes. But theres much to be enjoyed in the over-the-top imagery especially a horde of teenage girls in blood-soaked prom dresses wielding rhinestone-encrusted weapons and driving a Christmas-light bedecked whip blasting ""Party in the USA."" This September 2014 photo provided by NBC Universal Orlando shows character actors at UniversalAs Halloween Horror Nights in Orlando Fla. The horror film ""The Purge Anarchy"" which is the sequel to a movie about an annual night of unfettered crime and violence is just one of the inspirations for Halloween Horror Nights. The events feature hundreds of elaborately costumed actors and Hollywood-quality sets special effects and mazes inspired by pop culture influences ranging from El Rey NetworkAs A""From Dusk Till DawnA"" to AMCAs A""The Walking Dead.A"" (AP Photo/Universal Orlando Resort Kevin Kolczynski) These films are overtly political ""Election Year"" even more so. The message here about racial and economic inequality is relevant and accessible but not necessarily revelatory. But the heart of ""The Purge"" trilogy is ultimately deeply human. Our heroes fight to save individual lives among the mass death. They face a classic activist conundrum Is it worth your values to take up the tools of the master? One cant be against the Purge and also purge even if youre purging oppressors. The question of the film is not a political one but a moral ethical humane one. ""The Purge Election Year"" provides all that on its wild ride of blood-soaked anarchy.

June 30 2016Swiss Army ManStarring Daniel Radcliffe and Paul Dano. Directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert. Opens Friday at the Varsity. 97 minutes. 14AIt seems safe to say there will be no crazier film this year involving major actors than this existential love story. And maybe no more beautiful one either.Swiss Army Man is written and directed by Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan a.k.a. ""the Daniels"" of music video fame. They make ample use of their imaginations and visual talents to tell a unique love story.Article Continued BelowPaul Dano is Hank marooned on a remote Pacific Ocean isle who has come to realize that no one is coming to rescue him. Hes prepared to take desperate measures to end his loneliness -- until the day the body of a man played by Harry Potters Daniel Radcliffe washes ashore.Hank becomes involved with the stiff he calls ""Manny"" in ways that seriously need to be seen to be believed. It all makes for the strangest of bromances one thats destined to divide audiences as happened at the films Sundance premiere back in January. There were a few walkouts.No sensibilities are spared as Hank makes use of Mannys surprising dead-guy talents which include mad flatulence that allows him to be ridden like a JetSki and handy skills at providing water and starting fires. Go ahead and guess how Manny works as a compass.When Manny begins to shows signs of an after-death personality -- is it a zombie thing or is Hank going crazy? -- all bets are off as to where this story is headed. But its impossible not to get caught up in it even if youre simultaneously repelled by it.Peter HowellWeinerDocumentary by Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg. Opens Friday at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema. 96 minutes. 14ACo-directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg begin their doc as a redemptive chronicle of disgraced former U.S. Democratic Congressman Anthony D. Weiner. It turns into an astounding chronicle of hubris.Weiner resigned in 2011 after tweeting explicit photos of himself to young women online. Afterward he penitently claimed to have ceased his sordid habits but the lie catches up to him as he runs for NYC mayor in 2013.The camera catches his shock and paralyzing fear and the anger and dismay of his wife Huma Abedin and campaign staffers as an online gossip site reveals the candidate is still sexting women at least one of whom is seeking some kind of vengeance.Wrapped up in his own narcissistic bubble Weiner allows the astonished Kriegman and Steinberg to continue filming him to devastating effect.Peter HowellThe DaughterStarring Sam Neill Geoffrey Rush Paul Schneider and Odessa Young. Directed by Simon Stone. Opening Friday at Cineplex Yonge amp; Dundas. 91 minutes. 14AHenrik Ibsens The Wild Duck shifts from Norway to a moodily decaying Australian lumber town for this drama about a potentially heartbreaking long-quiet family secret.Estranged for years from his wealthy mill owner father (Geoffrey Rush) Christian (Paul Schneider) returns from the U.S. for the old mans wedding to his much-younger housekeeper. There he reunites with a childhood friend Oliver (Ewen Leslie) now married and with a teen daughter Hedvig (Odessa Young impressive).Oliver is out of work since the mill closed. Hes a struggling while damaged Christian who denies his demons and pieces a mystery together that will have far-reaching consequences if he cant keep it to himself.After a slow build the final act picks up the pace but director Simon Stone shows his hand too early. Still its chilling to watch the wreckage pile up.Linda BarnardThe Purge Election YearStarring Frank Grillo Elizabeth Mitchell and Mykelti Williamson. Directed by James DeMonaco. Opens Friday at major theatres. 109 minutes. 18AThe world has gone so topsy-turvy that the dumb-fun Purge franchise now qualifies as political satire.By vowing to end the annual Purge -- the one night when murder is legal -- underdog presidential candidate Sen. Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) has made seriously psychopathic enemies. Naturally they choose the grisly fiesta to take her out.She relies on her loyal security (Frank Grillo Anarchys taciturn butt-kicker) a deli owner (Mykelti Williamson spouting the best lines) and a Good Samaritan who kills like a samurai (Betty Gabriel) to ward off hordes of white-supremacist mercenaries ""murder tourists"" and bloodthirsty schoolgirls in gory corsets.Occupy Trump Black Lives Matter and the NRA all figure into the ideological swirl but purge the urge to look for real meaning. Like the election it clumsily invokes the lively third Purge is as thrilling as it is silly.Nick PatchOur Kind of TraitorStarring Ewan McGregor Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Susanna White. Opens Friday at major theatres. 107 minutes. 14AThe Cold War may be over but the Russian mafia schemes to infiltrate London one of the worlds financial capitals to launder dirty money.Ewan McGregor and Naomie Harris are British couple Perry and Gail holidaying in Morocco and struggling to get past infidelity. They encounter Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) a bluff Russian with a prodigious memory for numbers.Dima desperate to avoid certain death at the hands of a ruthless oligarch sees a ""gentleman"" and honest soul in Perry drawing him into a plan to defect by providing information on crooked British politicians.The performances are lovely and director Susanna White manages to wring maximum tension from the cat-and-mouse game. Fans of spy novelist John le Carre may take umbrage with the reworked ending but the film is nonetheless a riveting and accomplished work.Bruce DeMaraThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Pulp gets political and messy in The Purge Election Year - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Pulp gets political and messy in The Purge Election Year ""The Purge Election Year"" Michele K. Short / Universal Studios Edwin Hodge left and Frank Grillo in ""The Purge Election Year."" Edwin Hodge left and Frank Grillo in ""The Purge Election Year."" (Michele K. Short / Universal Studios) Justin Chang The end is nigh in ""The Purge Election Year."" Not the end of the world as we know it (another apocalypse? Ho-hum) but possibly the end of the Purge itself -- that cruel annual rite that for one night only allows all Americans to vent their bloodlust in the name of continued national health and prosperity. Pitting a heroic female presidential hopeful against a shadowy cabal of gun-toting one-percenters this is a crudely opportunistic engrossingly pulpy extension of a franchise that as ludicrous as its setup has always been seems increasingly in step with the violent absurdity of the times. That much is clear from the new movies cutthroat political rhetoric as well as a ghastly scene of a church being peppered with bullets.An image like that cant help but give you pause as it was clearly designed to do. Even more than in the series first two films the writer-director James DeMonaco wields his satirical ideas and topical reference points with a recklessness that similarly informs his murkily shot scenes of knife-to-knife combat and sniper fire. At times the experience of watching ""Election Year"" is a bit like scanning a few years worth of alarming headlines while someone sets off firecrackers under your desk. Black Lives Matter drone warfare local protests home-grown militias predatory capitalism the Florida electorate pop pop bang bang. In this frenzied B-thriller context where thinking too much could easily get you killed a hit-or-miss approach works better than you might expect. What once seemed like design weaknesses in DeMonacos speculative fiction -- the willful incoherence of his allegory and the scattershot quality of his satire -- now feel like a natural extension of his schlock-and-awe sensibility. He isnt concocting an alternate reality so much as sending out crazy dispatches from our own and he knows that a jab doesnt have to be subtle in order to land. The Purge Election Year trailer Watch the trailer for ""The Purge Election Year."" Watch the trailer for ""The Purge Election Year."" See more videos By now DeMonaco has also mastered a kind of quick drive-by characterization and here against the backdrop of Washington D.C. he erects an ensemble of straw people whose symbolic function can usually be summed up in a few sound bites. ""The soul of our entire country is at stake"" declares Sen. Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) a presidential candidate who apart from her cool blond demeanor is too thinly sketched to bear much of a resemblance to Hillary Clinton. Smart and sympathetic if a bit bland she seems to harbor no political agenda apart from her determination to abolish the Purge once and for all having lost her entire family 18 years earlier in a killers rampage. Rather than running against an obvious Donald Trump stand-in (because some figures exist beyond the reach of parody) Roan must go head-to-head with a prominent member (played by a freaky Kyle Secor) of the New Founding Fathers of America the evil government organization that initiated the Purge to begin with. (Any similarities between the NFFA and the NRA which is name-dropped separately here are probably not coincidental.) ""I have had it with all these idealistic pigs"" one NFFA leader spits directing his words squarely at the back row of the theater even as he and his conspirators take aim at Roan when the next Purge Night commences.Viewers who showed up for the first two movies will by now know the drill (and the rifle and the machete and the power saw). The first ""Purge"" (2013) was a cruddy but queasy-making home-invasion thriller that brought down the barricades shielding a familys McMansion and turned a homeless black man into a hero worthy of George Romero (an even more pronounced influence on the new film). The series quality kicked up a notch with ""The Purge Anarchy"" (2014) a nightmarish urban shoot-em-up that with a nod in the direction of John Carpenter broadened the allegorys scope and shifted its focus toward those on the margins of society -- nonwhite working-class citizens who were the real targets of the Purges cleansing campaign all along.That trend continues here with Joe Dixon (a wisecracking Mykelti Williamson) a hard-working deli owner who -- with the help of his Mexican-born co-worker Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) and his friend Laney (Betty Gabriel) a reformed gang member -- must protect his uninsured business from a few girls gone wild. Led by a precocious young Purger (Brittany Mirabile ferocious) who shows up in a blood-slicked pink tutu these and other killers seem to have borrowed a few moves and accessories from George Millers ""Mad Max"" movies and Harmony Korines ""Spring Breakers"" -- a connection reinforced by a recent surge in ""murder tourism"" thanks to a wave of young Europeans who have flown in to join the guilt-free mayhem. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Its not long before Dixons crew teams up with the imperiled senator and her personal bodyguard Leo (the excellent Frank Grillo) who was first introduced shooting and slicing his way through ""The Purge Anarchy."" The other recurring figure here is Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge) now a leader in the anti-Purge movement whose own insurrectionist plot prompts some obligatory moral handwringing in the third act. ""We cant be like them"" Roan pleads but rest assured that ""The Purge Election Year"" is never in danger of letting you confuse the haves with the have-nots. ""Is murder our new religion?"" someone asks early on and the question is made chillingly ridiculously literal in a sequence involving a freaky-as-hell midnight mass-- a savage spoof of gun-loving God-fearing America complete with psycho priests and weapons blessed with holy water. DeMonaco sets the stage with ghoulish delight though here as elsewhere he has a hard time generating any actual tension much less any real surprise over who will be left standing at movies end. I wouldnt be the first to point out that this franchise gaudily exploits the violence that it claims to condemn but theres a deeper hypocrisy here one that binds the commercial logic of this Hollywood franchise to the moral bankruptcy of the Purge itself So long as the right people wind up dead why not keep it going?------------The Purge Election Year MPAA rating R for disturbing bloody language and strong violenceRunning time 1 hour 45 minutes Playing In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Elections National Rifle Association of America Frank Grillo Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-purge-election-year-review-20160627-snap-story.html,200,thepurge10,thepurge,latimes

Theres no killer who looks like a squirrel whos lost his nuts. The man to fear is more normal slender gray-haired religious staid. He looks like a candidate whod get millions of votes in the comparatively civilized days of 2012. (Put down that pitchfork Mitt Romney.) Every cynic knows the real villain isnt the guy up front but the suits behind him a blurry room of men (and their token woman) sipping scotch from crystal tumblers and tut-tutting that ""idealistic pigs"" must accept that theres simply ""not enough to go around."" The poor have two choices stay poor or die. Three-time Purge director James DeMonaco shoots this plain-speaking presidential cabal through haze. There are few close-ups because the individual faces dont matter. The whole movie is like that an allegory that inks clear parallels between this violent America and ours and then smudges the evidence. These campaign funders arent Republicans -- here that word doesnt exist -- but if you associate that label with DeMonacos clan of shadowy old white men used to controlling the world thats on you. And Im sure its just a coincidence that opposition leader Senator Charlene Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) a ""wild-card independent"" just one point behind in the polls is a brainy blonde. Eighteen years ago on Purge Night a murderer forced her family to play ""Mommys Choice."" She was the only survivor. If elected her vow to abolish The Purge evokes three polarized responses hope skepticism and an outcry that shes stealing our freedom as if these annual 12 hours of armed chaos are how the founding fathers imagined their ""well-regulated militia."" George Washington mustve daydreamed about psychotic schoolgirls in masks and tutus shooting their parents. Ill at least have nightmares about this one played by Brittany Mirabile who cranks up the crazy -- and the Miley Cyrus -- while cruising down the streets in a sedan covered in Christmas lights like a drugged-out spring breaker. To kill or be killed? This not-so-sci-fi 2025 thriller captures a familiar helplessness How can you protect yourself from guns without strapping on your own? UniversalWhile convenience store owner Joe (Mykelti Williamson) and his favorite employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) guard their Washington D.C. shop from the fabulous Miss Mirabile police sergeant turned secret service agent Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) -- a survivor of The Purge Anarchy -- is tasked with protecting the populist senator despite her refusal to hide in a one-percenters bunker. Shell stay home thank you like the majority of voters. Mitchell plays her like a stubborn optimist but theres a noble quiver in her voice when she admits shes scared -- theres courage in choosing fear. Still raise your hand if you think theyll have a quiet night in. Whats more unexpected is how well this third Purge expands its slim nasty premise. The claustrophobic first film cared only about Ethan Hawkes rich daddy protecting his castle from thugs. It ended with a capitalistic shiv The wealthy fear the faceless needy but their worst enemies are their neighbors. Election Year stretches further grabbing at any parallel it can. DeMonaco opens with a black activist (Edwin Hodge) decrying The Purge as ""legalized murder"" -- shades of Black Lives Matter -- and rallies on to accuse insurance companies of making money off destruction pressuring working-class folks like Joe and Marcos to risk their lives to save their future. Later the news sure sounds like Trump when it warns of foreigners immigrating to murder Americans. We meet them dressed ironically in patriotic rave wear the way stoners party on the Fourth of July -- there are glow-stick Lady Liberty crowns and bloodied powdered wigs. But DeMonaco deliberately casts only white aliens from Russia and South Africa. Even in a movie with rhinestoned AR-15s ISIS is going too far. When Election Year elbows too hard we giggle -- say when ""P-U-R-G-E"" is scrawled in blood on the marble columns of the Lincoln Memorial. An alley guillotine screams French Revolution. But DeMonaco makes small choices I admire. For once no woman gets threatened with rape. Instead ladies seem to be the aggressors and as we cruise the streets of D.C. we see wives stabbing and incinerating husbands or dancing around a tree strung with male corpses. Meanwhile brave volunteer Laney (Betty Gabriel) puts her own safety in danger to rescue the injured -- and handcuff the furious kids who insist theyre still fine to fight. In the three years since the first Purge was a hit weve been forced to admit theres a lot more anger in the world than we realized. Partially thats due to global economic inequality. And partially its because were a species with anger in our blood. Were civilized now -- or at least we largely agree to act like it most of the time. Were no longer slaying rival cavemen nor slicing our suppers throat. But violence still vibrates inside us whimpering for an excuse to lash out. (Purge Night March 21 happens to be the anniversary of the launch of Twitter.) If weve learned anything from Trump rallies its that people readily rip off that mask of civilization in a supportive crowd. Take comfort in the two tough new heroes Election Year enlists in the battle for peace Gabriels mighty black female and Sorias fearless Mexican immigrant. Go ahead GOP or whatever your new Purge name is. I dare you to put them behind a wall.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Some thrillers scare us really effective ones upset us. While the craft of ""The Purge Election Year"" is amateurish the film is almost eerily well timed. The third entry in writer/director James DeMonacos surprise hit franchise about violent social collapse plays like documentation of a world going berserk. Theres a sense that presenting a bloody political slasher movie immediately following the horrors of Orlando and Istanbul is irresponsible. I think it delivers a wake-up call that those tragedies deserve. Its hysterical slash-and-burn tone is vulgar but we are not living in bland times. The premise is that some years previous the government commanded by the New Founding Fathers of America decided to revoke law enforcement one night a year. The Purge lets citizens blow off steam in a dystopian orgy of destruction. Not only does this reduce the population enrolled in costly assistance programs its a cash cow to be milked again and again. ""The Purge is Halloween for adults"" declares a costume shop owner who helps disguise the lunatics as Uncle Sam and Lady Liberty. Many of them show up for fright night already in costume skinheads with Confederate battle flag patches and swastika tattoos. The film trusts that you dont need reminding of what industry would make a nice profit from mass shootings and armed self-defense. Were introduced to Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) who watched her familys Purge night murders as a child and is now a presidential candidate promising to ban it. The NFFA aims to steal the election by kidnapping her. Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) is a tough former cop turned Washington D.C. security agent prepared to save her life by terminating countless Purgers. The onslaught introduces a number of working-class inner city defenders with a familial closeness across their diverse backgrounds. Mykelti Williamson gets the films limited but valuable laugh lines tossing off racially tinged hoots about the culture war. It hardly matters that the films rapid-fire editing feels as random as shuffling cards and the harsh illumination makes it look as if the movie has been filmed on a smartphone. Where DeMonaco hits his target is in scenes of crazies doing ritualized killing and of the raving ruling class urging them on. He also has a fine sense of soundtrack music opening the show with ""20th Century Boy"" by T. Rex and George Clintons ""We Want the Funk"" and bringing down the curtain with David Bowies ""Im Afraid of Americans."" The satire here is as subtle as blunt head trauma but it works. The Purge Election Year  out of 4 stars Rating R for disturbing bloody violence and strong language.

MOVIE REVIEW The Purge Election Year Running time 110 minutes. Rated R (gory violence profanity). ""The Purge Election Year"" imagines that right now laws are being ignored people gun each other down with impunity and the death toll is horrendous. Its too bad the title ""Chicago"" was already taken. Chicago though has for nearly a century been tightly controlled by a party that bears little resemblance to the Catholic neo-Nazi Tea Party- and NRA-lovers who are portrayed in the ""Purge"" movies. This ruling class has decreed that on one night a year everything is legal especially murder. The audience for horror movies (young people blacks and Latinos) is made up of Democrats and ""TPEY"" assumes theyll delight in a horror movie that contains several rants about the depravities of insurance companies pauses in mid-bloodletting to reflect on the electoral importance of Florida and features as a presidential candidate a liberal woman senator (Elizabeth Mitchell) who talks like Elizabeth Warren but looks like Jenny McCarthy. It all amounts to a bid to become the one scary movie of the year to be shown at the Democratic National Convention which would make it a horror show within a horror show. (The DNC would insist on removing the line ""Theres a whole bunch of Negroes coming right this way and were sitting here like a bucket of chicken."") Though it imagines devout Catholics holding a midnight Mass each year to celebrate human sacrifice of societys neediest people (the exact opposite of Catholic dogma) I would never dismiss ""Purge 3"" as just a ludicrous political allegory. Its also a ludicrous thriller. Writer-director James DeMonacos main tactic when not coming up with dialogue like ""Run. Fast"" is simply to have bad guys blown away by good guys who keep sneaking up behind them. Still I admired one detail. The Elizabeth Warren character advises her Occupy-type friends not to kill the man running for president on the pro-Purge ticket not because murder is wrong but because ""he becomes a martyr -- we lose."" For all of the movies ham-handed satire of conservatives it is unintentionally dead-on about how liberals think.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Alan Zilberman June 30 In the third installment of the ""Purge"" series the year is 2025 and a presidential candidate is running on the premise to do away with the night of terror forever. (Universal) ""The Purge Election Year"" is less tense than a political argument on Facebook and about as much fun. Each sequel in the franchise is a reinvention ""The Purge Anarchy"" (2014) went beyond the 2013 home-invasion thriller to write a parable about class bitterness. ""Election Year"" turns its focus on hypocrisy looking at how elites and insurgents jostle for power. Violent yet also cynical this action film never develops a sense of danger. In his third outing as writer-director James DeMonaco explores a United States that solves its problems with an annual ""Purge"" a 12-hour period during which all crime -- including murder -- is legal. This time there is a popular U.S. senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose presidential campaign includes a promise to end the event. Her message inspires Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) the hero of ""Anarchy"" who volunteers as her head of security while her political opponent (David Aaron Baker) conspires to murder her during this years Purge. Charlie and Leo survive the siege of her Capitol Hill rowhouse taking shelter in a deli owned by Joe (Mykelti Williamson). Together the three fight off deranged teenagers amoral Purge zealots and a neo-Nazi militia. Elizabeth Mitchell stars as U.S. Senator Charlie Roan who runs her presidential campaign under the promise that shell end the Purge. (Universal Studios) (L to R) Mykelti Williamson as Joe Dixon Frank Grillo as Leo Barnes Joseph Julian Soria as Marcos Betty Gabriel as Laney and Mitchell as Senator Roan in ""The Purge Election Year."" (Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures) Temporary lawlessness should inspire genuine despair or at least a gleeful sense of mayhem. Instead ""Election Year"" is a toothless affair one where Grillo and the others are only going through the motions of survival. DeMonacos challenge here is that the Purge has become part of the fabric of American life; when the characters in the movie experience no sense of shock neither do we. There are few clever details in the production design the sort of world-building that helps define a cinematic dystopia. Whats worse is the action itself. Even DeMonaco seems bored by the sieges escapes and gun battles. Silly one-liners are the only saving grace and thats because such acting veterans as Williamson know how to sell them. The villains in ""Election Year"" are monsters or radicals who believe the ends justify the means. That points to one stupidly obvious message The Purge is a bad idea. DeMonaco lacks the curiosity to explore how we got there or what it means. R. At area theaters. Contains bloody violence terror and strong language. 110 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"The Purge Election Year Surprisingly effective sequel and a commentary on politics - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Purge Election Year Surprisingly effective sequel and a commentary on politics Trailer The Purge Election Year Watch the trailer for ""The Purge Election Year."" Watch the trailer for ""The Purge Election Year."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The third ""Purge"" movie which may be the harshest political commentary this year in any medium is weirdly pretty good and carries the subtitle ""Election Year."" The America we see in writer-director James DeMonacos sequel mightve been dreamed up over a conference call among Donald Trump (a clear model for the movies prime minister) the National Rifle Association (referenced by name though not in a way the NRA would prefer despite the films high levels of assault weapon carnage) and the most reactionary of the Fox News pundits and contributors.All thats there if you want it. If you dont want it ""Purge 3"" works well enough as a simple scuzzy effective multitrack survival narrative with mostly new characters inhabiting the premise DeMonaco established with his first ""Purge"" movie. Not long from now the ruling political party the New Founding Fathers of America (""Make America great"" is their slogan) has miraculously cut the nations crime rate by devoting one night a year Purge Night to rampant murder unpunishable by law fun for all 12 hours of death and no consequences. RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURThe first ""Purge"" was a tightly confined home-invasion thriller leading to ""Purge 2"" more of a mean-streets open-air affair. ""Purge 3"" combines elements of both. Frank Grillo returns as Leo Barnes now security chief for Sen. Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan. Shes played by Elizabeth Mitchell sporting Im-super-smart black specs and a collection of characteristics borrowed from Megyn Kelly and Hillary Clinton. Roans running for president against the NFFA on a liberal anti-Purge platform which makes her an assassination target of her enemies. Holed up in her townhouse on Purge Night she and Leo learn theres a turncoat in the staffing ranks. A few corpses later theyre running for their lives on the streets of Washington D.C. portrayed in the movie by Providence R.I.Thats one level of play. Another concerns deli owner Joe (Mykelti Williamson) his immigrant employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) do-gooder Laney (Betty Gabriel) and their attempts to save their store from marauding crazies. This ad hoc group takes in Charlie and Leo early on and they take on the enemy from there. Theres a gang of neo-Nazi ""white pride"" thugs to deal with while across town an underground revolutionary (Edwin Hodge) puts his own Purge Night plans into action.The plot strands intertwine cleverly. DeMonaco remains a better writer than director. While some of the stray images of bloody insanity (bodies strapped to a careening cars hood like deer) stick in the craw often his scenes lack internal dynamism. (The movies also very light on extras; Purge Night feels like a Monday.) At its best though ""Purge 3"" recalls the vibe of early John Carpenter ""Assault on Precinct 13"" or ""Escape from New York"" for example. The women for once do more than just sit around and get tied up and threatened though of course that happens too. Its ridiculously easy to predict who lives and dies in ""Purge 3"" yet the predictability doesnt kill your interest in the outcome.Its nice to see an action movie take more than a passing interest in where our country is at the moment and then exaggerating that moment into the realm of shrewd exploitation. To wit Any film combining an indictment of false religiosity with an indictment of violence-solves-violence political pandering in a single line of dialogue -- ""These weapons have been cleansed with holy water"" -- is OK by me. And you know? I can name a long list of 2016 films ""The Purge Election Night"" is better than from ""Independence Day Resurgence"" to ""London Has Fallen"" to that hallmark of cheap emotional terrorism ""Me Before You."" mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""The Purge Election Year"" -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for disturbing bloody violence and strong language)Running time 145Opens Thursday eveningRELATED STORIESThe BFG review Oscar-winner Rylance delightful to watch in Spielberg adaptationIndependence Day Resurgence review Will Smiths the lucky oneBest movies of 2016 so far Zootopia The Witch Sing Street Caption Trailer Bad Moms Watch the trailer for ""Bad Moms.""

James DeMonaco wrote and directed the first two and returns for the third. The core of the films remains the same For 12 hours once a year all crime is legal even murder (which seems to be the only one people commit).Edwin Hodge (from left) Elizabeth Mitchell and Frank Grillo star in ""The Purge Election Year."" (Photo Michele K. Short)But this year change is in the air. Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) a senator is running for president on a platform that includes getting rid of the Purge and shes gaining traction (she has particularly personal reasons for her stance).Roan and her followers claim that while the Purge is supposed to be a cathartic experience that has helped unemployment and crime rates plummet its really a money-making scheme for gun manufacturers and a way to cull the population of minorities and the poor who are killed in disproportionately large numbers.The candidate for the New Founding Fathers of America (Kyle Secor) the political group that created the Purge obviously wants to keep things as they are. He leads followers in shouts of ""Purge and Purify"" a rather chilling refrain.Mykelti Williamson (from left) Frank Grillo Joseph Julian Sora Betty Gabriel and Elizabeth Mitchell star in ""The Purge Election Year."" (Photo Michele K. Short)A new wrinkle this year eliminates the off-limits status of top-level government officials meaning Roan is a particularly big target and a legal one to boot. Sergeant (Frank Grillo) the protagonist from ""The Purge Anarchy"" is now her chief of security and hes got his work cut out for him.In a side plot that will inevitably cross paths with the main one Mykelti Williamson plays a store owner whose Purge insurance gets jacked up the night before the big event leaving him no choice but to defend the place himself.

Before the commencement klaxons go off however we meet the rest of our heroes Joe (Justifieds Mykelti Williamson) the owner of a local deli that doubles as a neighborhood town hall; Laney (Betty Gabriel) a former gangster alpha female who doubles as a paramedic; and Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) a Mexico City transplant that happens to be a crack shot when shit goes down. (Immigrants They get the job done.) And yes Frank Grillo -- our generations Lee Marvin if were lucky -- returns as Leo Barnes the previous movies badass now working security detail for the Senator. In other words when theres politician-protecting arm-breaking neck-stabbing and self-inflicted bullet removals to be done hes your man. Once an attack forces Roan and Leo into the streets and the rest of the movies good-guy factions join up with them to make it through the next 12 hours Election Year breaks out the maniacs in blank-faced masks and baroque B-movie touches -- a killers car covered in white Christmas lights a guillotine sideshow a Pit and the Pendulum-style booby trap -- thats become the franchises aesthetic stock in trade. It also offers up the most diverse ensemble casting this side of the Fast amp; Furious flicks an ecstatic church-and-state ""mass"" that plays like a Fox News wet dream some genuinely disbelief-suspending plot devices and the sort of camp-nip quotables (""The original founding fathers are about to fuck up the new founding fathers"") designed to further rile audiences already drunk on hootin hollerin bloodlust. Mostly though what The Purge Election Year delivers is a sort of come-one-come-all chance to rage against the machine. Despite the left-leaning ideology embedded into the series DNA its still a bit of a political Rorschach test You can look at Sorias hero as an example of pro-immigration tendencies and see the roving packs of Euro ""murder tourists"" as pandering to the xenophobic crowd (""Foreigners coming to our country"" intones a news reporter ""to kill""). And for all of its protagonists anti-Purge liberalism the story sure gives a lot of ammo to the pro-Second Amendment ""the only way to handle a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with gun"" crowd. Rather the films real currency is simply a nonpartisan free-floating us-vs-them anger in which a put-upon underclass finally gets payback and a one-percenter upper class finally gets its comeuppance. You can be a pissed-off Tea Partier or an Occupy advocate and find something here to stoke your fat cat hatred; either way catharsis is doled out not in a dusk-til-dawn homicidal free-for all but two harmless hours in a theater. Election Years only real stance -- besides be sure to vote in November -- is that America is violence. God bless the U.S.A. God save us all.

If youre a first-time visitor to the twisted America in James DeMonacos ""Purge"" franchise heres what you need to know For one night each year all crime including murder is legal. Its a national release valve that reduces the overall crime rate. More important it culls poor minorities while ensuring the safety of wealthy well-protected whites. Critics have largely dismissed the ""Purge"" movies as pandering action-horror fare (which they are) full of bargain-basement social allegory (which is true). Nevertheless DeMonaco deserves credit for tackling issues of race income inequality and government complicity with admirable bluntness. There are no nuanced metaphors in a ""Purge"" movie. advertisement | advertise on newsday Number three in the series ""The Purge Election Year"" benefits from shrewd timing. Although theres no orange-haired authoritarian running for president here there is a woman Sen. Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell). Roan looks a little like Sarah Palin and is campaigning as a Washington outsider. Her promise to end the Purge has her surging in the polls but first she must survive the night. Her security chief is Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo returning from 2014s ""The Purge Anarchy""). Photos10 best movies of 2016 so farSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016 As in the previous films the pre-Purge lockdown scenes effectively build tension. A black deli owner Joe (Mykelti Williamson) hunkers down with his Mexican-American employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria). Laney Rucker (Betty Gabriel) hops into her makeshift ambulance to help still-breathing victims. Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge now on his third ""Purge"") runs an underground triage center. Theyll all come together to help Roan and Barnes who have been betrayed ambushed and forced onto some very mean streets. ""Election Year"" doesnt have the wild imagination of its predecessors although Brittany Mirabile is memorable as Kimmy a blood-soaked schoolgirl with a Minnie Mouse hairdo and a machine gun. DeMonacos directing still feels stagy; this ""Purge"" is the choppiest and least artful yet. Still it works as quick and dirty entertainment and its not mindless.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Somehow its taken three Purge movies for writer-director James DeMonaco to get around to squeezing the social implications of the series low-rent dystopian premise--a future America where people are allowed to kill each other with impunity one night a year--for everything theyve got. Switching to a largely black cast while retaining the raspy mystery man played by Frank Grillo in The Purge Anarchy The Purge Election Year stakes out a position as a corrective to the usual inner-city chase flick rooted in a fear of all things poor and non-white. Though too sloppy to hold weight as a political statement (e.g. ""capital"" misspelled in the opening info-dump) Election Year nonetheless manages to pack itself full of potent anxieties from a minority-owned business under siege from the roving rich to heavily-armed racist militias to the all-white powers-that-be gathering at a midnight slaughter in pseudo-Masonic collars.Set in Washington D.C. Election Year re-introduces the formerly nameless Leo (Grillo) working security for progressive presidential candidate Sen. Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose platform includes eliminating the Purge the free-for-all during which emergency services go dark and all crime is legal. Though the mechanics of the Purge remain mostly nonsensical Election Year at least explains how anyone manages to stay in business in a country where everything goes to hell on an annual basis a predatory unregulated ""Purge insurance"" industry free to hike up rates just hours before the sirens sound the start of the killing. (Note Though all crime is legal the America of The Purge appears to be blissfully free of rape arson or plain old theft.) Unable to make his latest payment middle-aged Joe (Mykelti Williamson) takes to the roof with a lawn chair and a rifle to protect his small convenience store which is where Leo and Roan will eventually end up after surviving an assassination attempt. Like Anarchy Election Year works in the classic B-movie vein of ragtag groups moving under threat with Joe Leo and Roan joined by Joes only employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) and by Laney (Betty Gabriel) a regular customer whos part of a corps of volunteers who look for the wounded in D.C.s less protected neighborhoods in armored ""triage vans."" The first movie a muddled home-invasion thriller set in a rich gated community hinted that most of those killed in the Purge were black but Election Year goes a few steps further presenting the annual killing spree as a kind of end-game nightmare for black America where anyone can get away with killing a black man and the economic and political system are rigged. (This is sadly not that far out.) Coinciding with the lead-up to the election the Purges serve to violently curb voter turnout and DeMonaco never one for subtlety also introduces the idea of ""murder tourists"" coming from abroad to participate--all white hailing from places like South Africa and Russia. Just to drive the point home David Bowies ""Im Afraid Of Americans"" bellows over the end credits. Instead of continually switching up threats as Anarchy did Election Year follows its characters as they evade a band of mercenaries--a sporadic tour through the ways alternate-future D.C.s black residents survive from secret underground hospitals to momentary alliances of street gangs activists and rescue volunteers. DeMonaco and cinematographer Jacques Jouffret who have worked together on all three of the movies have become more capable and confident when it comes to style. The first Purge could barely keep up a sense of tension; its slapdash camerawork made it impossible to figure out where anyone was at any given moment despite the fact that almost the entire movie took place in a single house. Here theyve finally settled on a look pulling the old low-budget trick of using a lack of lighting to effect. Unreadable shadows drop over characters faces while the aforementioned hospital appears to be lit entirely with practical sources (i.e. prop lamps rather than big movie lights) contributing to an appropriately gritty vibe. And though DeMonacos dialogue skews laughably phony its hard not to like the way he motivates his characters setting up conflicts of goals rather than personalities. For all its flaws Election Year has those baseline pleasures associated with violent American B-movies of the 1970s and 80s--that mix of simplicity and scuzzy juicy execution. One might accuse it of luridly chasing the politically topical if only its images--even the really silly ones involving vampiric political lackeys and maniacs in bloody Abe Lincoln masks shouting ""I love America"" in Russian accents--didnt seem like they were coming straight from the gut.

The Purge Election Year mirrors national mood Article Tweet Universal Pictures Frank Grillo and Elizabeth Mitchell in The Purge Election Year The Purge Election Year    1/2 (out of five) Director James DeMonaco Cast Frank Grillo Elizabeth Mitchell Mykelti Williamson Rated R (disturbing bloody violence strong language) Running time 105 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 346pm on Wednesday Jun. 29 2016 Wednesday Jun. 29 2016 Wednesday Jun. 29 2016 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Writer/director James DeMonaco stumbled into a box-office goldmine with his 2013 film The Purge. The 3 million horror film set in an America where theres an annual 12-hour period when all crimes -- including murder -- are legal raked in more than 64 million.That can only mean one thing sequels. But DeMonaco hasnt been content just to reheat the original premise in which a family is terrorized at home. He opened up the universe making it more pointedly sociopolitical in The Purge Anarchy two years ago and that continues with the topical The Purge Election Year a darkly efficient and grimly entertaining thriller that may be as far as DeMonaco can push the concept.Frank Grillo returns as Leo Barnes though now he has relocated from L.A. to D.C. as head of security for a presidential candidate Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) whose No. 1 priority is to end the purge. But the ruling party the New Founding Fathers of America has no intention of letting this happen. Theres too much money to be made from the purge -- from insurance companies to ""murder tourists"" coming from abroad to participate -- and its a neat legal way to get rid of societys undesirables.Meanwhile at street level a social activist Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge) has been leading a movement to stop the purge too claiming that its racist and classist. Not only that but he plans to assassinate top officials.How convenient would it be for the ruling elite if both Charlie and Dante got offed in the purge? Of course neither Leo nor a few heroic average citizens -- including wisecracking convenience store owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) his get-tough friend Laney (Betty Gabriel) and his immigrant assistant Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria) who all end up spending the purge night with Charlie and Dwayne -- want to let that happen. The Purge Election Year then becomes a rather standard-issue though well-staged cat-and-mouse game with the political angle becoming less involving as the film goes on. Still there are some clever moments -- the shoplifting teenage girls turned would-be purge killers the Russian murder tourists dressed as American icons -- that give The Purge Election Year an electric charge.But the most chilling thing about the film is neither the violence nor the rather heavy-handed sociology but how its nervous paranoid mood mirrors our own.

Youll find it. Its so simplistic and heavy-handed that its impossible to miss but to be honest its the least interesting thing about the film. If on the other hand its sleazy kicks youre after youll be in exploitation heaven. Because writer-director James DeMonacos third chapter in the thrill-kill vigilante franchise is the best and pulpiest Purge yet. When the first Purge hit theaters in 2013 it became a surprise hit thanks to a gloriously perverse high-concept premise that had the sort of fiendish simplicity you could have fit on a blood-stained cocktail napkin. If anything the idea was a lot smarter than the movie that spun off from it. Set in the year 2022 America has rebounded from economic catastrophe unemployment is at an all-time low and crime is non-existent. Why? Because one night every year the government sanctions a no-questions-asked license for ordinary folks to kill loot and act out their most depraved impulses. In the first film Ethan Hawke was in the eye of the Purge Night storm trying to protect his well-off family from the masked mob. It was basically a low-stakes siege movie that left most of its best ideas on the table. The follow-up 2014s Purge Anarchy opened up DeMonacos ultraviolent world beyond one familys bloody fight for survival while introducing a promising cop character played with sinewy slice-and-dice heroism by Frank Grillo. Quality-wise however the sequel was a lateral move. RELATED Meet Frank Grillo the knockout actor who will dominate your summer In Election Year DeMonacos reach finally matches his grasp. Senator Charlene Roan (Losts Elizabeth Mitchell) is a presidential hopeful and champion of the downtrodden who wants to abolish Purge Night. Naturally the powers that be (i.e. older white men in their one-percent star chamber) are threatened by her soaring grassroots popularity and put a bounty on her head during this years Purge. Grillos Leo Barnes (thankfully) returns this time playing her head of security. Hes the sort of no-nonsense badass that if Election Day was made 40 years earlier his role would have been played by Charles Bronson. Since this is hardly enough to hang a 105-minute B-movie on the film also introduces a struggling African-American deli owner (Mykelti Williamson hogging all of the films best lines) his loyal delivery man (Joseph Julian Soria) a Black Lives Matter-style revolutionary (Edwin Hodge) a tough-as-nails Good Samaritan (Betty Gabriel) and a deadly posse of Neo-Nazi mercenaries gunning to assassinate the Good Senator on behalf of the nefarious incumbent Lockjaw in Chief (Kyle Secor). One of the many things that DeMonaco does surprisingly well in Election Year is throwing together all of these characters and making it feel organic to the story. Williamson Soria and Gabriel come to the aid of the on-the-run Mitchell and Grillo helping them run the kill-crazy gauntlet til daybreak. Another thing he excels at is borrowing from other really good genre movies like Clockwork Orange Soylent Green The Warriors Total Recall and especially John Carpenters Escape from New York. (He must have an excellent DVD library at home.) Still Election Year manages to put a lot of ideas and images on screen that are totally its own. Especially its hallucinogenic ""Halloween for adults"" vision of Purge Nights murder and mayhem. The films violence (and theres a ton of it so consider yourself warned) is stunningly art-directed. In one scene the steps of D.C.s Lincoln Memorial are lit up with bonfires and littered with dead bodies while its white columns are graffitid with the word P-U-R-G-E scrawled in blood. In another a rabid mob of female looters sport cutesy masks and are tarted up in skimpy corsets while wielding bedazzled machine guns. Its like watching Miley Cyrus skipping through Dantes Inferno. RELATED 20 Celebs Who Starred in Horror Movies Before They Made it Big Its tempting to watch Election Year and draw knee-jerk parallels between Mitchells virtuous senator and Hilary Clinton and Secors righteous right-wing blowhard Minister and Donald Trump. Actually its impossible to read the film any other way. But DeMonacos campaign-season partisan allegory doesnt do the film--or its message-- any favors. As political satire its cheap obvious and lazy. But as a rousingly tense Carpenter-esque thriller Election Year is surprisingly effective. The only shame is that films finale paints itself into a narrative corner that will make it tricky to justify another sequel. Too bad because three films in the Purge saga has finally hit its sick sadistic stride.

The action scenes are frequently incoherent involving a bunch of guys pulling guns on each other and the director shaking the camera vigorously for 15 or 20 seconds before revealing a few bodies lying on the ground covered in blood. People in the movie spend a fortune to fortify their homes but no one thinks to buy a 400 plane ticket to non-purging Canada. Theres not a lot of nuance or sense in the third ""Purge"" movie. But it still manages to coast on a combination of self-awareness crowd-pleasing carnage and a plot that ties perfectly into current events. You might think that real-life political leaders got in a room with the United Kingdoms officials and conspired to make this ridiculous movie seem relevant. The first ""Purge"" released just three years ago was an intimate affair. Half the films 3 million budget one assumes went to co-stars Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. Most of the film took place in a single house and in our imaginations as we discovered a world where murder is legal one night every year. Since then writer-director James DeMonacos vision and the real worlds dysfunction have grown in equal measure. ""The Purge Election Year"" features a pair of presidential candidates whose ideals match those of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders with a getting-less-inconceivable-every-day law that allows their Internet trolls to follow through on their deepest urges. Our hero is Sgt. Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) who is sent to protect anti-Purge candidate Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell). When things go awry they join forces with three goodhearted liquor store workers. Grillo and Mitchells characters are humorless and prone to bad decisions and have an odd chemistry possibly trying for a Humphrey Bogart/Katharine Hepburn ""The African Queen"" vibe but never quite getting there because masked maniacs keep interrupting their quiet time. Mykelti Williamson is much better as the store owner bringing humanity to the film and much-needed comedy. (""Its Purge night"" the character says to a friend he almost guns down. ""You dont sneak up on black people"") Even though the movie takes place in 2025 theres zero thought put into the look of the future. According to the filmmakers 10 years from now equals a few more bad mustaches. Attempts to dumb down the movie are comical at times. (Note how presidential hopeful Roan favors the exact same eyeglasses frames that she wore as a 14-year-old Purge victim so no one in the audience will get confused.) Worst of all the film has developed a broader rooting interest which starts to kill the guilty pleasure/exploitation qualities of the series. Its less like ""Death Race 2000"" and more like ""The Hunger Games"" now with warring factions and a possible positive result beyond survival. And yet if the anti-Purge good guys win the audience loses. There will be no more Purge movies. (Or theyll just look like an episode of ""The West Wing."") Thankfully DeMonaco keeps things moving too quickly to dwell on any shortcomings. Hes a below-average director of action scenes but he has some very good ideas. Theres a playful subversive streak to DeMonacos style thats reminiscent of ""Dawn of the Dead"" director George Romeros zombie movie work and James Wans efforts with the first ""Saw"" films. Mobs have set up a guillotine in an alleyway. A caught shoplifter returns for her candy bar with a bedazzled AK-47 and a car covered in Christmas tree lights. Millennials from Europe travel to America for ""Purge tourism."" And pleasingly the worst of the worst almost always meet the films most brutal and graphic ends. The movie is part of a greater metaphor about a fracturing country a weapons lobby run amok and a dangerous divide between the rich and the poor -- although its hard to tell how much of that metaphor is intentional. After the third or fourth theater beer is anyone watching ""The Purge Election Year"" really going to care? Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Barry JJ Soria. Its election year in the world of ""The Purge"" Director James DeMonaco (Running Time 145) R For disturbing bloody violence and strong language. Area Theaters. America may be in bad shape right now but at least the countrys not at the point depicted in ""The Purge Election Year."" If you missed James DeMonacos two previous films ""The Purge"" takes place in a future where the American government-known as the New Founding Fathers of America (or NFFA)-allows crime (including murder) to rampant for one 12-hour period a year in hopes of getting it out of everyones system. After 18 years people have discovered this Purge is basically the NFFAs way of getting rid of the undesirables the poor and the homeless while making the insurance companies billions. The best thing going for the third installment of the series is its title which reminds us how ugly our own elections have gotten over the past few months Set two years after the events in 2014s ""Anarchy"" Frank Grillos police officer Leo Barnes has a job as head of security for Senator Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) who is running against the NFFA for President. Having lost her entire family during an earlier Purge shes clearly the reformer camp along with other factions trying to dispose of the NFFAs solution to Americas problems. Indy teen who killed 3 people in 4 days inspired by The Purge Theres no killing off this franchise The Purge Election Year continues to beat the premise to death. (Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures) Set in the two extremes of Washington DC.-rich white politicians juxtaposed against the poor lower class-were introduced to a number of heroic characters audiences can root for. Theres Joe (Mykelti Williamson) an older African-American deli owner who just wants to protect his place from looters as well as his Mexican employee Marcos (JJ Soria). Joes customer Laney (Betty Gabriel) risks her life on the night of the Purge to provide medical assistance to the needy. When the NFFA hires assassins to take out Roan helped by some of her people Leo finds himself unable to trust anyone until he runs into the other three heroes and they decide to fight back. The decisions made by the NFFA are certainly extreme yet draw uncomfortable parallels with whats going on in the real world. Unfortunately this movie looks as low-budget as the previous ones and its obvious little of that budget was used to get the level of actor that could have done more with DeMonacos material. Grillo is perfectly fine as a ""Dirty Harry""-type action hero put into a ""Die Hard""-like situation of having to keep Senator Roan alive but its Williamson who gets the best punchlines and screen-time. From l. Mykelti Williamson Frank Grillo J.J. Soria Betty Gabriel and Eliabeth Mitchell mobilize to for the third movie in the Purge franchise. (Michele K. Short/Universal Pictures) When all else fails DeMonaco falls back on showing people dressed in wild outfits purging and dancing around their murder victims like something out of a nightmare rave. But anyone with a head on their shoulders wont swallow a sequence involving a working guillotine set-up in an alleyway. Theres no explanation; its just another random gory visual thrown your way. Its more than slightly disconcerting to sit in an audience applauding madly at the most vicious and violent kills but ""The Purge"" movies seem to thrive on this blood lust. Sure DeMonaco has a few new clever ideas but the movie never gets into the type of political discourse one might expect when bringing politics and election into the world of ""The Purge."" Now that DeMonaco has done three of these and presumably left his blood-thirsty fans with a satisfying way to end things maybe he can move on. After three disturbingly violent films this may be a concept that deserves to be purged.

Horrorshow The Purge Election Year Ad Mocks Presidential Campaign Commercials (Video) WWE Star Luke Harper Cast in Horror Movie Mohawk Universal Loses Motion to Dismiss The Purge Copyright Lawsuit The third entry in the ""Purge"" franchise puts presidential campaign paranoia to effective schlocky use It was perhaps inevitable that the insane American political climate of 2016 fascinated with civilian militarism and and at least one truly grotesque presidential candidate would find itself co-opted by pop cultures most gruesomely dark and sloppily moral action-thriller franchise. The result is ""The Purge Election Year."" 2013s ""The Purge"" began as a more or less simple home invasion movie -- though one with hints of a sinister backstory. But while the rest of the moviegoing world was bingeing on superhero franchises watching the Avengers exorcise the aftermath of 9/11 a different brand of chaos was pushing its way into popular culture like a tenacious weed through concrete; call it The Purge Cinematic Universe. See Video The Purge Election Year First Trailer Takes Terror to Washington DC Previously on ""The Purge"" we were introduced to a future America the year 2022 in which crime largely has been eradicated thanks to something known as the New Founding Fathers. Powered by a sweeping conformity a fundamentalist religious zeal and a major case of the kill-em-alls the U.S. population ""celebrates"" an annual event called the Purge in which all crime including murder is legal for a 12-hour period. They do this because theyre told to do this and because dressing up in Halloween costumes and taking chainsaws to annoying neighbors is exhilarating. In the first film a well-to-do family led by Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey dealt with the effects of the annual blood circus on their own fortress-like McMansion. And that was pretty much it. Message Are you rich and do you live in a bubble of delusion? You are going to die. In ""The Purge Anarchy"" the action takes place outside among the have-nots in an almost apocalyptic Los Angeles as cop Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo ""Captain America Civil War"") leads a band of terrified people to safety. Its here we learn more about the so-called New Founding Fathers. Turns out they use the Purge to keep the poor non-white non-powerful population to a minimum. Message Are you anyone without access to major wealth and your own bunker or armored vehicle? You are going to die. Also Read Teen Charged With Murder for Purge-Inspired Killing Spree The fascism racism and sincerely held paranoia is on explicit display this time around and thats because its time to vote for a new President a ritual that brings out the gnarly worst in anyone prone to it. One of the candidates however is anti-Purge. Charlene ""Charlie"" Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell ""Lost"") witnessed the slaughter of her entire family 18 years ago and promises to end the Purge if elected. Naturally shes now a target of the people who profit most from Americans killing Americans for sport. Enter Barnes promoted from police officer to Roans chief of security and were back on the streets as they stay one step ahead of the New Founding Fathers conspiracy to kill the woman who would upset the political status quo. Joining the escape team are a convenience store owner (Mykelti Williamson ""Justified"") his loyal employee (Joseph Julian Soria ""Army Wives"") and a formerly violent neighborhood woman turned Purge angel of mercy (Betty Gabriel ""Experimenter""). Also Read Box Office Battle for No. 2 Finding Dory to Out-Swim BFG Purge Tarzan Grillo is exactly the right man for this role the thoughtful tough guy who can pull bullets out of his own body and who always looks like he needs a shower but who cant stop for such indulgences until he knows everyone else is safe. And the ensemble around him forms a tight empathic unit. We want the Purge to keep going; we also want this crew to smack it down hard. Returning writer-director James DeMonaco deepens and details his sick sad world piling on despicable corporate behavior NRA profiteers violent anti-Purge activism shoplifting schoolgirls in party dresses who carry blinged-out machine guns and kill to Miley Cyrus songs fun-loving Purgers rigging up public guillotines Purge-by-drone Lincoln Memorial vandalism neo-Nazi mercenaries murder tourism and at least one sing-along to the old American Christian hymn ""There Is a Fountain Filled with Blood."" Also Read Universal Sets Release Dates for Four Blumhouse Horror Movies ""The Purge Election Year"" much like ""The Purge Anarchy"" before it wears its vintage John Carpenter allegiance on its sleeve. DeMonaco and editor Todd E. Miller only let up the action in order to draw your attention to some new perverse curiosity of modern death fetishism. DeMonacos vision is realized effectively by the murk and shadow of cinematographer Jacques Jouffret (like DeMonaco hes shot all three ""Purge"" movies) where most of the shots seem to be lit by emergency-exit signs and the kind of hand-held lamps found at construction sites underground tunnels and other places where the pick-ax killer from ""My Bloody Valentine"" would hang out. Its a grim world of nasty pleasures here the kind you wont feel guilty about unless it all somehow comes true in 2017. In the meantime theres no real harm in doing like DeMonaco and having your grindhouse cake and eating it too. Cheer on a violent film about righteous non-violence today why dont you? Therell be plenty of time to be sorry about it later.

Daily Edition Login to download The Purge Election Year Film Review 601 AM PDT 6/29/2016 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A speculative but frightening political scenario. TWITTER 7/1/2016 Frank Grillo returns as a hardened security expert protecting Elizabeth Mitchellas presidential candidate in this third installment of the Universal franchise. Arriving in quick succession The Purge (2013) and follow-up The Purge Anarchy (2014) introduced audiences to a near-future nation governed by the ""New Founding Fathers of America"" a political party that oversees a violent annual social ritual with the stated goal of lowering the nations overall crime rate. For 12 hours during a single night every year the NFFA administration permits citizens to commit almost any type of crime including murder without fear of prosecution or reprisal. Writer-director James DeMonacos concept quickly found favor with audiences who rewarded Universal with two straight hits inspiring the current installment The Purge Election Year. The potential success of this third iteration may not rely so much on the thriller franchises brand identity as it does on the relatability of the premise which posits that a presidential contest will determine the ongoing viability of the Purge. Unless theyre unusually prescient its unlikely that the filmmakers would have clearly foreseen the intensity of current political debate although the pics unexpected alignment with this years especially fractious electoral cycle may turn out to be a profitable draw in an opening-weekend field largely devoid of comparable competition. With a presidential election looming Leo Barnes (Frank Grillo) has relocated from Los Angeles after surviving Purge night two years prior in order to head up the Washington security detail for Sen. Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) a candidate running against the NFFA whos determined to eliminate the Purge from American culture after 25 annual repetitions of ritual violence. Since her campaign overlaps with the recurring night of mayhem Barnes prior experience with the event is clearly an advantage but even his hardened tactical experience falters when an assassination attempt on Roan forces them out on the street in the middle of the Purge when most of the city is hunkering down at home. Attempting to dodge random gangs of attackers as an expert kill team closely tracks them Barnes and Roan take shelter in a convenience store far removed from the glamor of Capitol Hill where African-American owner Joe Dixon (Mykelti Williamson) is attempting to protect his livelihood with the support of his loyal immigrant employee Marcos (Joseph Julian Soria). When a group of murderous marauders besieges the store Joe calls on his close friend Laney (Betty Gabriel) to help them escape in her rescue van that patrols the neighborhood providing medical assistance to Purge victims. Laney delivers them to an underground bunker where political firebrand Dante Bishop (Edwin Hodge) is coordinating a conspiracy plot of his own that threatens to trap Roan and Barnes in an escalating conflict between the NFFA and Bishops radical followers. Franchise originator DeMonacos well-structured script isnt particularly subtle about arraying these factions against one another in a manner that unabashedly reveals its B-thriller origins. Although the minimal dimensionality of the competing motivations on display doesnt contribute much to complex character development at least the rivalries are assertively expressed. Social conflicts also are clearly articulated and while some fairly unconvincing theories are tossed out in frequent debates concerning the underlying purpose of the Purge they mostly remain within the limits of the films fundamental themes of exploitation and disenfranchisement. Grillo brings a reassuring gravitas to the role of Barnes that was too often missing in Anarchy as he focuses his visceral reactions on his mission to protect the senator at any cost. Grillos intensity saps some of the momentum from Mitchells performance however as shes repeatedly called upon to voice political platitudes rather than dig too deeply into her personal reasons for opposing the Purge. Williamson Gabriel and Soria form a formidable supporting trio with Gabriel especially adept at demonstrating her characters unique badassery. DeMonaco has further upped his game with the third installment by working closely with franchise cinematographer Jacques Jouffret to design rewardingly more complex action sequences and well-focused set pieces that are both efficiently executed and visually engaging.

""The Purge Election Year"" is a scurrilously effective pop rabble-rouser -- a movie thats been built to get you riled and does. Its a squalid B-movie political horror film that plays to our most reptile-brained basic instincts and also to our cartoon-noble ideals and by the end you cant separate the two; thats the way canny shameless pop works. In the opening scene the members of a family are sitting on a couch bound and gagged and blood-spattered while a masked killer entertains them with tunes from his ""Purge playlist"" (he makes an obscenely jaunty segue from ""20th Century Boy"" by T. Rex to George Clintons ""We Want the Funk""). A guy like this in another film would have been a violent head case but in the ""Purge"" movies where even the most horrifyingly twisted murder is legal for one night a year hes just a dude getting his demented ya-yas out. Hes the sicko killer inside us all. A bit later the movie takes us to another Purge Night eighteen years after the first one when a crew of innocents are holed up in a bodega. The natural born killers theyre facing are tarty teenage girls brandishing jewel-studded automatic weapons (and power saws) who look as if theyd just stepped out of the slasher movie of Quentin Tarantinos dreams. Watching ""The Purge Election Year"" its easy to see why the rah-rah blahness of ""Independence Day Resurgence"" didnt connect with audiences. In 2016 this is what tasty patriotic popcorn looks like. ""The Purge"" in 2013 was a glorified stalker-in-the-house movie. A year later ""The Purge Anarchy"" improved on it by keeping most of the action to the streets and by introducing the lean-and-mean actor Frank Grillo as Leo a haunted good guy who can be as ruthless as a purger. Youd think the concept would now be wearing thin but ""Election Year"" which feels like the final chapter in a trilogy (though after the box office grosses are in that could change) is the best ""Purge"" film yet. The action is excitingly sustained in a way that it wasnt in the previous two and the political dimension while crude as hell exerts a brute-force entertainment value. The movie revolves around an idealistic savior of a presidential candidate Charlie Roan (Elizabeth Mitchell) who has pledged to bring an end to Purge Night. (She was the girl who survived that opening scene.) A majority of citizens appear to be leaning her way so the U.S. government born again as the NFFA (the New Founding Fathers of America) decides that theres only one way to stop her by abducting and killing her on Purge Night. James DeMonaco who has written and directed all three films still walks a slightly awkward line between exploitation and intelligence and he should really stop shooting every scene in wavery hand-held close-up but in ""Election Year"" he embraces the pulp guts of his material. The ""Purge"" films may be the rare example of high-concept movies in which the concept is actually more provocative than the execution. Not that the concept is all that original; its been banged together from bits and pieces of the movie past. A future in which gangs of youthful hooligans run wild is of course straight out of ""A Clockwork Orange."" The notion of ritualized slaughter as a legal and celebrated spectacle all presided over by a theocracy of decadent elites is right out of ""The Hunger Games."" The stray glimpses of baroque terror we see on Purge Night -- in ""Election Year"" they include death by guillotine and victims strapped onto car hoods like deer -- evoke the random marauder madness of ""The Road Warrior."" And the plot of each film with a crew of survivors doing all they can to get out of the way of people whove become killing machines makes the ""Purge"" movies a lot like zombie films. If you squint a bit you can make out the ghost of ""Lord of the Flies"" that 1954 schoolroom classic that introduced so many us to the concept of The Beast Within. Whats unique in the ""Purge"" films is how much the anarchy and murderous evil are sanctioned. Theyre what an overly controlled society should hate yet in the ""Purge"" films homicidal craziness has become a cornerstone of civic duty. How messed up -- and relevant -- is that? Keeping the masses down by encouraging them to vent everything that they are. Its like a violent version of Internet culture. To all that the ""Purge"" films add a drop-dead layer of political satire and in ""Election Year"" that layer is pushed front and center. The NFFA sells Purge Night as an escape valve that gives rise to an otherwise peaceful tranquilized society. Really though its a conspiracy and a fraud a way of killing off poor people so that the rich wont have to support them. Not perhaps since ""Soylent Green"" has a future-shock parable been so memorably obvious in its metaphor. Kyle Secor as the NFFA ringleader who presides over the annual Purge Mass (a church service in which the members of the power elite pray to the gods of murder to keep them rich) seethes and exhorts like a Richard Nixon mask come to life. The skewed intensity of his performance -- so many people to keep down so much money to protect -- cues you to see that yes this really is a movie about whats happening today. Elizabeth Mitchell isnt a bad actress and she bears a fetching resemblance to Judy Collins but shes miscast. Even in the pop future she doesnt seem remotely presidential which may be why shes asked to wear a pair of horn-rims that make her look like a porn star impersonating a college professor. But she forms a convincing bond with Grillos Leo who is now her police bodyguard and their deadpan flirtation helps to carry the movie. Mykelti Williamson as the deli owner who has just lost his purge insurance and is full of wrath about it is the films perpetual scene-stealer and the anchor of its comic-book racial politics. When our heroes are huddled in a triage van he brings down the house with a retro-badass line like ""Theres a whole bunch of Negroes comin right this way and were sittin here like a bucket of mother---in chicken"" In ""The Purge Election Year"" its kill or be eaten. The violence in ""The Purge Election Year"" usually promises to be worse than it is which is one reason why this is a mainstream movie. ""A Clockwork Orange"" shocked people because of how it got us to identify with Alex but theres never a moment in ""Election Year"" when a character we know and like turns into a purger killing for the nasty pleasurable kick of it. The movie never takes that risk and so it never reaps the reward of dramatic complexity. The one thing in ""Election Year"" that carries a tinge of honest shock value is the portrayal of a political ruling class that elevates its self-interest into a religion of destruction that pretends to benefit everyone else. You may watch these scenes with a shock of recognition and with a feeling that its time that side of American political life was purged.

Reply purge says July 15 2016 at 212 am i have watched previous purge movies and i liked them. guess this will be good movie too Reply James Dix says July 8 2016 at 733 pm Nothings original. The concept of sanctioned craziness goes back-at the least-to the original Star Trek (""The Return of the Archons""). Reply loco73 says July 3 2016 at 1246 am In a strange but welcome way ""The Purge"" is the little movie franchise that could. The budgets for all three movies combined dont even add to a fraction of what the budget for a single Marvel movie or the above mentioned ""Independence Day Resurgence"" end up costingYet for what they were intended to be the movies delivered. ""The Purge"" franchise also has that unfortunately rare distinction whereby each subsequent instalment has gotten better something which actually bucks the trend where each prequel or sequel of much larger and more established movie franchises instead of improving have gotten more watered down and of poorer quality. In this case while the first movie featured the more high profile and easier recognizable cast especially Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey the next two movies have almost drawn down in terms of the actors profiles but not their detriment as it turns out that Frank Grillo is a scene stealer and a lot of fun to watch as where the rest of the cast populating the last two installments . Of course having Michael K. Williams appear in ""The Purge Anarchy"" and in anything else for that matter is always a win-win for me Say what you want about this franchise but if movies with such a bare-bone barely there budged can deliver such a level of enjoyment and entertainment with a sprinkling of substance concepts and ideas...this should give pause to studios to think about the direction they are heading in...if ""The Purge; Election Year"" with a 10 million dollar budget is proving to be a contender against such movies as ""Tarzan"" with a price tag of 180 million dollars and ""The BFG"" with a 140 million dollars one....ouch Reply ken1lutheran says July 2 2016 at 355 pm You can always get some people in Hollywood to stand up and salute when you make a gruesome caricature of conservatism. They live in a make-believe world in which conservatives are ogres. Reply Decker says June 29 2016 at 952 pm To anyone familiar with the original Star Trek (the vast majority of Hollywood) the Purge is obviously a feature adaptation of Return of the Archons. Before any trolls jump on this with other film nerd references please just defer to the writer/director who has admitted this several times in interviews and knows better than any critics or bloggers which material he ripped off. Reply Jason D says June 29 2016 at 141 pm Torture porn goes mainstream and becomes respectable if you kill conservatives and Republicans. How much more BS is Hollywood going to serve up? Reply cadavra says June 29 2016 at 711 pm Nowhere in the review are the words ""conservative"" and ""Republican"" even mentioned. Youre merely projecting your own bizarre hatred of the industry onto an even-handed review. Go away. Reply LOL says June 29 2016 at 1203 pm Its like the Brexit campaign then. Since last week South Asians in Britain have been getting punched in their masses. Even a Native American living in Manchester got decked on the tram. Scary times. Reply HDPR says June 29 2016 at 1031 am This series is tight. And a welcome respite from the CGI Marvel bs where characters just fling each other around with no consequence. I hope this is a massive hit. It has its finger on the pulse of American frustration and also the best ideal of melting pot behavior. Reply irwinator1992 says June 29 2016 at 909 am This and the other Purge films are disgusting shameful worthless trash. Theyre another reason why I despise Michael Bay. Reply Rex says June 29 2016 at 741 am Sooo ""a future in which gangs of youthful hooligans run wild"" can be traced all the way back to Clockwork Orange but the only antecedent this reviewer can find for ""the notion of ritualized slaughter as a legal and celebrated spectacle all presided over by a theocracy of decadent elites"" is The Hunger Games? Not The Running Man? Battle Royale? Or Series 7 The Contenders? Death Race 2000? Rollerball? The 10th Victim? Come on seriously. How effortless is it to pick onl;y the most blatantly obvious pop culture reference points? Then again Mr. Gleiberman did scribble for Entertainment Weekly once upon a time but I know he knows better. Sigh... Frankly the act of referencing all the OTHER movies that another movie REMINDS you of should be banned among professional critics unless its a deliberate homage which is not the case in the examples cited above. Its lazy column padding barely suitable to the amateurs who clog sites like IMDB and Amazon -- not to mention a million blogs -- and it only makes a paid professional look every bit as shallow and inexperienced. So knock it off. Please and thank you. Reply millerfilm says June 30 2016 at 1255 am Hey if a movie works it works. Everything is borrowed from everything this being 120+ years into movie history. Reply Seifer says June 29 2016 at 746 am Wheres your experience Rex? I dont see you on any review sites and you need to deal with a review being an opinion and not be so pompous or condescending in your attitude. Since just because you didnt like the movie doesnt make you a better person. Reply Kenny says June 29 2016 at 701 am Owen you said its ""like a violent version of internet culture"" but the real-life parallel there is what happened in Baltimore after Freddie Gray The mayor actually encouraged rioters to ""vent."" Thats scary as hell and reality today in the U.S. Weve long since passed satire...

Imagine That familiar ugly scenario is the core story of ""The Purge"" franchise a low-budget high-profit series focused on a future America that has commercialized catharsis legalizing an annual 12-hour-festival when anything even murder is allowed. Its a story that owes more than a little to the original ""Star Trek"" series specifically ""The Return of the Archons"" - and if the great Landru ever hears of it he will not be pleased. But the hyper-violent intensely gory films have found an audience - even as theyve lost some of their original stripped-down drama. Most of the first ""The Purge"" back in 2013 was cannily set inside a single house; it got its mood from the claustrophobic confines of a suddenly invaded McMansion and its drama from the idea of a family facing ugly life-or-death decisions. But the second movie opened things up too much by forcing various characters to traverse a city in chaos. And now the third continues that while pushing things in a more political direction. The only returning major character from the last film is Frank Grillo then playing a police officer now serving as head of security for a liberal presidential candidate. He provides continuity but not much more; theres always been something a little sleazy about Grillo onscreen and hes a poor choice to play any kind of hero. Better though is a decision to populate the film with African-American characters. The movie is set in Washington D.C.; it would be dishonest albeit not unusual to whitewash that. But the characters - particularly Mykelti Williamsons macho shopkeeper and Betty Gabriels stern avenger - provide a warm retro vibe. Theyre like walking tributes to Fred Williamson and Pam Grier. Less successful is Elizabeth Mitchell as a liberal presidential candidate with buttery blonde hair and oversized ""serious"" glasses. In fact her whole part of the plot is a bit flimsy; if the government is as firmly totalitarian as it seems why even risk having an election? Or allowing a candidate like this to get so far? The film is better when it doesnt try to ""say"" anything and contents itself with simply showing all the festive violence - adults in bloody clown masks death cars decorated in Christmas lights a murderous Uncle Sam. The scenes are over-the-top (private citizens setting up guillotines and razor-sharp pendulums in alleys?) but provide most of the films genuinely nightmarish atmosphere. Still effective as it all is - even with an over-reliance on jump scares - ""The Purge Election Year"" is like the rest of the films in a series an ugly one reliant on scenes of sadism and depravity. A hypocritical one too. Because even as it loudly decries the fascist government thats put this law in place it basically agrees with them Most people are savages kept in check only by the fear of arrest. Youre better off if you stay inside. Lock your doors. And dont go out to the movies - unless its ours. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. The Purge Election Year (R) Universal (105 min.) Directed by James DeMonaco. With Frank Grillo Elizabeth Mitchell Mykelti Williamson.
