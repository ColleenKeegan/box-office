But somewhere between Elizabeth Bennetts charming ninja exertions against the undead and the grim determination with which our 16th president now wields an axe against blood-suckers in this flashy adaptation directed by Timur Bekmambetov mash-up mania appears to have subsided. And with it all its diverting silliness. As a result the movie-version Vampire Hunter is both more arty-handsome than the concept warrants and less out-there than it ought to be. No spoiler Lincoln first began his hunting expeditions because as a boy he saw those suckers go after slaves. (Theyre all white these vampires.) When he intervened to save a little black friend they went after his own mother. And when he became a man -- the adult Lincoln is played by Benjamin Walker with a look of perpetually stricken self-effacement -- he committed himself to the eradication of the infernal species under the tutelage of a rogue good vampire named Henry Sturgess. As played by Dominic Cooper (Mamma Mia The Devils Double) with brisk gusto Henry is the guy who appears to be having all the fun. And when Cooper has scenes with Rufus Sewell as the chief vamp meanie the two Brits put on a jolly show of vampire eyeball glares. In the face of all their energy Walker -- who made a sexy splash as yet another past POTUS in the title role of the Off Broadway hit Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson -- loses his edge. Bekmambetov is the Kazakh stylist who made the Russian cult pics Night Watch and Day Watch and gave the Angelina Jolie action fantasy Wanted its distinctive visual hustle. Here he tints Vampire Hunter in fine Civil War-appropriate sepia tones. He also works productively with the weird tendency of 3-D movies to make everything look like a pop-up book. Why not -- this warped history is essentially a pop-up book. But in the process the director and the screenwriter (Grahame-Smith pruning his own book of any complexity and skipping the whole John Wilkes Booth portion of the story) back away from risking a point of view. With a title like Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter this production has the opportunity to be crazy-absurd. With the notion of slave owners as the worlds true vampires it has the possibility of making stirring political analogies. With the bloody bloody agonies of the Civil War as its centerpiece -- Lincoln makes his Gettysburg Address in the middle -- the picture could have been a shriek against the ghoulishness of battle. And with so much flesh crunching and bloodletting it could have been scary as all Walking Dead get-out. Instead the movie plays safe by cutting every theme down the middle -- a swing thats effective when splitting wood or vampire skulls but dull when applied to filmmaking.

Sinclair Did you even LISTEN to the review? For all of your pissing and moaning Roeper gave it an accurate and frankly glowing review He was absolutely dead and I really enjoyed this movie Probably the most BELIEVABLE presentation of nonsense that has ever been presented. a j Sinclair said on Friday November 02 2012 60702 PMits a movie. its meant to entertain. not comply to your delicate senses. yes the movie was outlandishly unrealistic but its meant to entertain nothing else. why do all critics think that every movie has to be a perfectly performed drama or comic book hero for it to be worth a good review. Im just saying you probably didnt take this job or hobby out of your hatred of just being entertained by a movie . Charmainsaid on Friday August 17 2012 42324 PMHi there I read your new stuff daily.

I saw this movie and loved it for exactly what is a popcorn munching over the top summer movie. In a way i miss these types of summer films and dont know how or when the climate of summer film reviews changed. Nikisaid on Wednesday July 18 2012 33316 AMRight now it sounds like Movable Type is the top blogging platform out there right now. (from what Ive read) Is that what you are using on your blog? Goeunsaid on Tuesday July 17 2012 121739 PMInstead what if we place the coins in three dimensional space with the four prinsdeets standing in a line facing the same direction. The difference in profiles would place us (the viewer) in between Jefferson and Lincoln. The symbolism here would be that these four prinsdeets would all be looking forward into the future as we all look backward. Because their faces are on coins and the united states uses a fiat currency we can assume that these great forward looking men are telling us that we place an imaginary sense of grandeur on our past. Maybe Im reading too much into it. Nikolesaid on Saturday July 14 2012 63022 AMSpot on with this write-up I honestly feel this site needs much more attention.

At area theaters. It is so very easy to get excited about a Tim Burton-produced film called ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" Its all about the juxtaposition right? Honest Abe slaying the night crawlers. The lanky top hat taking down the caped blood-sucker. Stoic Lincoln the mind behind the Emancipation Proclamation beheading the undead with a modified ax. And to that extent the Timur Bekmambetov-directed film rules the film school. Its home to some beautifully bloody visuals especially those of the 16th U.S. president (played by a slightly wooden Benjamin Walker) carrying out his (mostly) secret double life as an angst-filled trench coat-wearing vampire hunter. But getting there is hardly a treat. The movie -- based on a book by Seth Grahame-Smith the same mind behind the similarly playful ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" -- has a difficult time with narrative. And even though it lends itself to Bekmambetovs hyperstylized production the disconnect between intention and final product is a head scratcher. The plot here is one of revenge. A young Lincoln loses his mother to a gang of vampires -- but not before she tells him that ""until everyone is free we are all slaves."" Lincoln fails at his first attempt to avenge her death which came at the hands of vampire citizen Jack Barts (Martin Csokas). But when hes taught the vampire-hunting trade by the refined Henry (Dominic Cooper) Lincoln moves to Springfield Ill. to begin his new life. Lincoln works in a store by day studying law between customers and slays vampires by night. (There are multiple nods to ""Buffy"" intentional or not.) In the process he meets Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) discovers politics rekindles a childhood friendship with Will (Anthony Mackie) and later packs away his ax after becoming president. The film is more action than horror and were it not for a spectacle-filled sequence at the end -- involving a train heist a humans-vs.-vampire battle and a blinding bridge fire -- it would be a hard recommendation. But because Bekmambetov has an eye for action-filled fantasy this film has its own superficial mostly visual merits. A hand-to-hand combat fight carried out in a field of charging mustangs? A reimagining of the Civil War with undead zombie-like soldiers making up the Confederate Army dropping their guns on the battlefield and charging their Union enemies with only bared teeth? And a train heist with double- and triple-crossings flittering fireflies bloodthirsty vampires and a life-threatening fire? This ""Vampire Hunter"" has nothing to do with history with the paint-by-numbers script that brings it down. It has everything to do with its intoxicating visuals and for many moviegoers thats more than enough.

""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" seems to be an example of this promising so much campy-awesome historical-fiction insanity with that title but delivering a benignly dumb product thats disappointingly restrained. Maybe the novel is different although its author Seth Grahame-Smith wrote the screenplay too. Oh and hes also credited for last months miserable ""Dark Shadows."" He evidently has a passion for vampires that outpaces his ability to write about them. In this version of American history young Abraham Lincoln (played as a child by Lux Haney-Jardine) is devastated by the death of his mother at the fangs of a vampire named Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) who by day is merely a ruthless local merchant. Hes pretty racist too but there was a lot of that in those days. There was apparently a lot of vampirism as well. Abe grows up seeking vengeance against the evil Barts and as an adult (now played by Benjamin Walker) meets a drunk carousing vampire tracker named Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who fills him in on just how prevalent they are. Henry even has photographs of some of the more prominent bloodsuckers which he displays via carousel slide projector in much the same way that CIA officials fill their agents in on the facts of their cases. Of course we all know that vampires cant be photographed and especially not in 1837 but whatever. ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is set in a fictional version of history where Abraham Lincoln was a vampire hunter and where advancements in photography were made much faster. They have sunglasses and sunscreen too. And these things allow vampires to walk around in the daylight. But again whatever. I SAID WHATEVER Abe moves to Springfield Ill. to study law and to bump off the vampires on Henrys kill list. He meets a lovely young lady named Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets a job working in a shop owned by Joshua Speed (Jimmi Simpson) debates Stephen Douglas (Alan Tudyk) on the merits of slavery and I guess becomes president at some point. (The movie kind of glosses over it.) Through it all Abe and Henry strive to wipe out the vampire population which is led by a creeper named Adam (Rufus Sewell) and is making alliances with certain Confederate folks. There are two ways to tell a tongue-in-cheek revisionist-history story like this the clever way and the dumb way. The clever way involves adding fictional details that coincide with -- and do not contradict -- the actual facts of history. The dumb way involves a half-hearted attempt at that combined with a lot of flaccid references to famous things. Guess which route were taking here. This is a step down for Russian director Timur Bekmambetov whose ""Night Watch"" ""Day Watch"" and ""Wanted"" (with Angelina Jolie) were exactly the kind of energetic preposterousness that ""AL VH"" ought to have been. Sure theres a battle scene in which a vampire throws a live horse at Abraham Lincoln. What the movie needs is MORE of that -- more crazy nonsense more outrageous history-baiting more ""I emancipated that vampires head from his body."" (Thats not in the movie. It should be is what Im saying.) Bekmambetov doesnt expect us to take the premise seriously exactly. But he doesnt seem to want us to laugh at it either. He seems caught in between working both angles -- intense vampire flick and campy spoof -- at the same time. And as history teaches us a house divided against itself cannot stand.

Theres definitely some empty-calories summer-movie fun to be found in this ludicrous genre mashup most of it courtesy of maniacal Russian director Timur Bekmambetov who stages hilarious imaginative almost free-form action sequences like nobody in the business. Theres a scene in this movie that involves an ax fight between the young Mr. Lincoln and a slave-trading vampire mastermind set amid a stampeding herd of horses who are alternately used as conveyances obstacles and weapons. In its own idiotic and limited way its a work of genius and you could almost say that about the movie as a whole.Bekmambetov marshals a first-rate production design team for this screen adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smiths bestseller (scripted by the author) and the opening shot of this movie is spectacular We see the contemporary skyline of Washington and then watch as all the modern buildings and infrastructure gradually melt away taking us back to the marshy city of our 16th president with the White House surrounded by open fields and stone row-houses and the Washington Monument only half completed. Lincolns young life in the Indiana wilderness and the frontier capital of Springfield Ill. is also captured in impressive detail. One can only wish that the story and characters seemed either a.) halfway convincing in the context of 19th-century America or b.) worth the time and effort it takes to watch it let alone the immense expense and hard work of making it.In Grahame-Smiths earlier hit novel ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"" (which has also been rendered into a film to appear later this year) he simply interpolated new material and themes -- presumably never contemplated by Jane Austen -- into a public-domain literary work. Theres some of that in the book ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" but the whole thing is way more elaborate involving a secret Lincoln journal (entirely fictional with a few tidbits from his known works) and a reworking of Civil War history in which the slave-owning caste of the antebellum South becomes a secret conspiracy of undead bloodsuckers. Thats sort of halfway clever as long as you dont think about it too much but in the movie version Bekmambetov and Grahame-Smith have jettisoned the elaborate back story and modern-day framing device in favor of nonstop splatter and silliness which exposes how thin this idea really is. You Might Also Like Looking for all the world like a digitally engineered younger version of Liam Neeson Benjamin Walker gives a curiously leaden performance as the ax-wielding hero Lincoln although hes ably supported by snaky-looking English actor Dominic Cooper as a repentant vampire who has turned against his own kind. (Has anyone written a doctoral dissertation about that archetype yet?) But its not Bekmambetovs splendiferous and camped-up action scenes culminating in a vampires-on-a-train climax that would dazzle Sam Peckinpah that are the problem here. Its the fact that adding a bunch of jokey gory vampire battles to the most violent and dramatic period of American history is not merely gilding the lily but is an atrocious insult to the memory of those who lived and died then and to the historical resonance of those events which emphatically continues to this day. Its actually not OK in this case to say smirkingly that history is boring and would be way cooler if it had more sexy vampire chicks and stuff blowing up. The struggle against slavery -- a practice that had poisoned our country root and branch from its inception -- and the worst war in American history and the life and death of our greatest and weirdest president have enough action and suspense for 20 movies. Sure this movie is meant as camp from beginning to end and isnt trying to replace real history. (One of its last lines of dialogue is ""Abraham Hurry up or well miss the play"") Which ought to mean that Ill forget how much it pissed me off really quickly and only remember the horse-flinging.

"Abraham Lincoln Ashamed of this movie |       NJ.com comments Abraham Lincoln Ashamed of this movie Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 22 2012 at 812 AM View/Post Comments Alan Markfield Benjamin Walker plays Americas 16th president in the horror mash-up movie ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" Well at least nobodys going to wander into ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" wondering what theyre getting into. Really too many movies hide behind meaningless come-ons. Who exactly are these ""People Like Us""? What is ""The Magic of Belle Isle""? You cant tell the tales from the titles and thats how the studios want it. But exploitation movies -- ""Snakes on a Plane"" ""Hobo With a Shotgun"" -- are made of sterner stuff. They tell you what theyre going to give you and then they do. Except what ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" mostly delivers is a long ugly march through bad CGI dull acting and dreadful writing. The story begins with the death of young Abrahams mother -- to a vampire it seems. (Its part of the storys re-jiggered mythos that only sinful victims seem to join their undead attackers; good people simply die.) So once he comes of age Abe goes in search of vengeance. But he soon meets a truly skilled vampire hunter. And he learns to go in search of justice instead -- a widened quest that eventually leads him into politics and then the presidency to fight a vampiric horde that has infected most of the South. This is all nonsense obviously but its rather garishly colorful nonsense. (I can imagine a campy prequel about James Buchanan chastely fleeing the embraces of villainous succubae.) It could be fun if the filmmakers had fun with it. Instead -- and this may be the only joke in the whole picture -- they actually take it seriously. Its not just the dully earnest performances. (Star Benjamin Walker bragged that he prepared by reading several biographies of Lincoln; he would have better spent his time watching Hammer movies.) Its the pallid palette the pasted-on chin whiskers the flat dialogue. Walker who may be best known for his stage work in the revisionist ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson"" -- I guess a Rutherford B. Hayes sitcom is next -- has no charisma as Lincoln even when hes giving the Gettysburg Address. Dominic Cooper and Rufus Sewell are mere cutouts as friends and enemies. The movie doesnt even look good. Director Timur Bekmambetov is a mad visualist best known for the import vampire films ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch""; he also made the wild if incomprehensible ""Wanted"" with Angelina Jolie taking baths in warm wax. But hes run out of ideas here. The first time he has a fanged vampire lunge at the 3-D camera its a cheap but effective trick; by the fifth time its an annoyance. And the poor CGI adds only the most unwelcome kind of unreality in which animated armies clash by night. Its a shame because a livelier director -- say an in-his-prime John Carpenter -- would have found the nasty bad-taste jolt to this story. The politics too; the idea of parasitical plantation owners as literal bloodsuckers is a juicy one the movie fails to exploit. And exploiting juicy ideas is sort of what exploitation movies are supposed to do. Instead what we get is a B movie treated like an A movie that mostly ends up being a zzzzzzzzzz movie. Although it has one good line toward the end. ""Abe"" the nagging Mary Todd shouts. ""Were going to be late for the theater"" And off the Great Emancipator rides for his tragic date with destiny. But hey it could be worse. He could have been going to see this. Ratings note The film contains gory violence nudity and sexual situations. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (R) Fox (105 min.)

James Adams The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 22 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 21 2012 523PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Timur Berkmambetov Written by Seth Grahame-Smith and Simon Kinberg Starring Benjamin Wallace Mary Elizabeth Winstead Rufus Sewell Dominic Cooper Classification 14A Genre action Year 2012 Country USA Language English The trouble with the so-called high-concept film is that too often the concept is the best thing about it and the actual movie essentially a series of rather rote progressively more tiresome variations on its premise. Think Snakes on a PlaneTwins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny De Vito Alien vs Predator Dumb and Dumber or Hobo with a Shotgun The biggest high comes from the images evoked by the title alone or the title in tandem with the movie poster doesnt it? Multimedia Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter the official trailer Certainly this is true of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Director Timur Berkmambetov (who had a hit a few years ago with Angelina Jolie in Wanted) piles on the CGI the 3-D effects the fangs and the phlegm and the gore. But finally the veins are drained in vain with few exceptions Berkmambetovs techno-strenuousness delivers no more kick than the simple silly but nonetheless inspired gambit of mashing the name of the 16th president of the United States with the Buffy-esque job title ""vampire hunter.""Based on the best-selling 2010 novel of the same name by Seth Grahame-Smith (who also co-wrote the screenplay) the movie takes some of the touchstones of Lincolns 56 years and warps them into a weave of the factual and the fantastic. Its well-known for instance that Nancy Hanks Lincolns mother died in 1818 when Abe was only 9. The cause of death is generally ascribed to her having consumed poisoned milk apparently a common phenomenon in rural America in the 19th century. But in Grahame-Smiths revisionist hysteria Hanks demise is the result of being bitten by a vampire named Jack Barts a violation the young Abe just happens to witness from his attic perch and of course later vows to avenge. A dab hand with an axe in real life - one of Lincolns many nicknames was ""the rail splitter"" -Grahame-Smiths young-adult Lincoln (Benjamin Wallace) crosses paths with a dissolute vampire hunter Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) who steeps him in both vampire lore and a spew of axioms (e.g. ""Real power comes not from hate but from truth;"" ""Only the living can kill the dead"") while sharpening the lads chops to lethal perfection. Soon its chop chop Abraham Lincolns silver axe hacking down upon their heads whack whack Abes silver axe making damn sure they are deadBerkmambetov shows real kinetic skill in these early encounters which are all the more potent for their relative brevity. There are also flashes of droll humour while picnicking with Mary Todd the woman who will eventually be his wife (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) Lincoln apologizes for his weariness and distractedness by saying ""Im sorry; Ive been working nights."" Expanding upon that he confesses ""Ive killed six vampires"" at which an amused Mary remarks ""And I thought you were an honest man. Really Abe""Would that Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter had more such playfulness. Instead it gets more like a comic book; the set-pieces ever more (and numbingly) violent longer gimmick-laden and noisy the story preposterous cartoonish impenetrable the characters like cardboard cut-outs in dressup. Somewhere in all the murk Lincoln decides to forsake hatchet jobs for marriage family an obviously fake beard that gives Wallace all the eminence of a whiskery Robin Williams the presidency of the United States and the abolition of slavery. Of course once a vampire killer always a vampire killer even if youre pushing 60 when in the course of the Civil War Lincolns desperate Confederate counterpart Jefferson Davis agrees to an unholy alliance with Adam the 5000-year-old King of the Vampires (Rufus Sewell) the prez realizes he has to come out of retirement and apply both his smarts about the undead and his axemanship to ensure that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth.Last time I looked the U.S.A. was still standing but what likely could perish this weekend is this movie as Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter finds itself trading box-office blows with Pixars mighty Brave.

The fill will be released in theaters on June 22 2012. Photo Credit Twentieth Century Fox Film advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In which our 16th president fights a different kind of civil war. BOTTOM LINE Not the gonzo mashup it should have been but a humorless self-important slog that seems to think its dopey premise is true. CAST Benjamin Walker Mary Elizabeth Winstead Anthony Mackie LENGTH 145 The title sells itself doesnt it? With just four words ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" promises gonzo thrills and postmodern dissonance refashioning our 16th president into a hipster action figure the beard the hat the bloodied ax. Surely someone somewhere already has the tattoo. But ""Abraham Lincoln"" has a different idea It wants to be taken seriously. So seriously in fact that the film seems to consider itself a legitimate biopic as somber as ""J. Edgar"" and as rueful as ""The Iron Lady"" -- and thats despite the presence of gurgling Confederates in pancake makeup. Its a baffling approach to an audaciously silly concept and the result is not just a letdown but an absolute disaster. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break The straight-faced treatment sucks the fun out of this material and leaves only the pulp. The notion of Lincoln (a likable Benjamin Walker) slaughtering vampires to avenge his mothers death feels stale from the start and theres nothing fresh about characters like good-guy vampire Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) and coven leader Adam (Rufus Sewell). Lincolns friend Will (Anthony Mackie) represents some vague connection between slavery and vampirism -- an intriguing idea -- but the film lacks the wit to illuminate it. As skulls are split and guts spilled first lady Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) remains outside the fray growing quietly gray near her husband. The incoherent script (adapted by Seth Grahame-Smith from his novel) is perfectly matched by the flailing direction of Timur Bekmambetov (""Wanted"") who lingers on dull stuff like marital bickering and rushes through the action sequences in a jumble of mismatched styles (slow-mo fast-mo parchment-hued authenticity). ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" could have been a lowbrow treat or at least a campy hoot. Instead its a failure so complete that it may indeed make history.

Let the stupid plot the stupid history the stupid action scenes the stupid trivializing of slavery . . . On an unfortunate-ideas scale of one to 10 with one being ""wearing white pants after Labor Day"" and five being ""Green Lantern"" this one rates about a fourscore and seven. Vampires it turns out were murdering American pioneers before an informal treaty saw them banished mostly to the South where they were given the OK to feast on slaves and indirectly start the Civil War. This movie is loud but I could barely hear it above the sound of jaws dropping on the floor. As a boy young Abe defends a black kid who gets beaten by an evil employer who also turns out to be a vampire and kills Abes mom. Local vampire-killing expert Henry (Dominic Cooper failing to blend into 1820s Indiana with his British accent) agrees to train Abe as a master assassin who chops off heads and limbs with his vampiricide silver-tipped ax. As Abe uses up some screen time dispatching a list of easily slain subsidiary vampires he awaits his big chance to get the one (Marton Csokas) who killed his mother and a couple of assistant villains (Rufus Sewell Erin Wasson). But he decides politics is a greater antimonster weapon. So If vampires were Northerners maybe Abe would have supported slavery? I didnt know whether to be more offended as a moviegoer or as an American but I do know Id rather gargle nitroglycerine than watch this again though given that the film looks like it were buried under a log cabin for a century I barely saw it the first time. A dusty case in point Lincolns chase of the lead vampire in a city suddenly bizarrely turns into a murky CGI horse stampede across the prairie. During which a bad guy throws a horse at Lincoln. I realize vampires are hard to kill but why is Abe uninjured after plummeting off a cliff at about 60 miles per hour? Hes not a superhero just a guy with an ax twirling around fast-slow-fast. Who knew Honest Abe invented Matrix Time? Playing Lincoln is a guy named Benjamin Walker who reminded me of one of the most notable Lincoln portrayers Robo-Abe in Disney Worlds Hall of Presidents. Nudged only slightly -- Scruffy the Vampire Slayer? -- this material could have acknowledged its absurdity and been a zany Mel Brooks-ian comedy but all-American director Timur Bekmambetov (""Wanted"") maintains an Ed Wood-level earnestness throughout as he asks us to consider that Gettysburg might have been turned around by a secret shipment of vampire-killing silver projectiles. Wait -- dont you handle vamps with crosses and holy water? Shouldnt they save the silver bullets for the sequel ""Mahatma Gandhi Werewolf Butcher""? Never mind. Why is the story about Lincoln anyway? Because if it were just a random backwoods monster-slaughtering yokel whose tiny girlfriend stands on his stovepipe hat to kiss him (is it reinforced with oak?) nobody would care. Lincoln is the random celebrity hook for a buzz-fed culture in which everyone youve heard of is essentially a guest at the same cocktail party of history. So the Soup Nazi is kinda like Hitler Nicole Richie equals Niccolo Machiavelli Shakira is a peer of Shakespeare. Whatever theyve all been on Gawker right?

Starring Benjamin Walker Dominic Cooper Anthony Mackie Director Timur Bekmambetov Release Opened Jun 22 2012  Editorial Review His ax splits more than railsBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 22 2012As much of a mixed bag as its portmanteau title suggests ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is both terribly silly and a lot of fun. Delivering fewer consistent frights and more laughs than some might wish from a flick about bloodsucking ghouls this adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smiths 2010 bestseller is nevertheless reasonably gripping summertime entertainment. Thats thanks in large part to filmmaker Timur Bekmambetovs strong sense of action and visual style. The Russian-Kazakh director of the arthouse vampire twofer ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"" pays as close attention to details as to the big picture. Arcs of spurting vampire blood -- as black and viscous as Cherry Coke syrup -- are as carefully choreographed as the action sequences. One set piece features a horse stampede during which the ax-wielding hero (Benjamin Walker) does gymnastic battle with the vampire (Marton Csokas) who has killed Lincolns mother (Robin McLeavy). That biographical detail apparently was left out of most history books about the 16th president (though it may have found its way into Bill OReillys ""Killing Lincoln""; Im not really sure). Bekmambetov imbues ""Lincoln"" with the sepia look of old Mathew Brady photos. Its effective even if at times it contributes to an overall murkiness necessitated by the films 3-D technology which is largely wasted on gimmicks such as flicking the tip of a slavers whip in your face. Speaking of gimmicks the premise is one colossal contrivance. According to the book and film Lincolns motive of vengeance evolves from the personal to the political when the shopkeeper-turned-lawyer-turned-statesman realizes that the institution of slavery was created as a way to feed white Southern vampires resulting in the Civil War. Strangely enough it works. Internal logical consistency is all any lover of vampire films asks for. And the admittedly ludicrous conceit while one giant metaphor is for the most part airtight. Despite the addition of such non-canonical vampire attributes as invisibility the film generally respects tradition. Vampires aversion to silver (their version of Kryptonite) is a pivotal part of the films spectacular climax which involves the Battle of Gettysburg as well as a clash between the hero and the vampire leader Adam (Rufus Sewell) on a train hurtling over a burning trestle. The films twist ending -- which is based on multiple meanings of the word ""railroad"" -- is nicely satisfying. As Lincoln the Juilliard-trained Walker falls just on the dull side of what one expects from an action hero. While good at evoking the awkward unsexy suitor of Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) he seems an oddly wooden choice to play someone who dispatches vampires with a silver-tipped ax wielded like a majorettes baton. That incongruity is front and center in the films oxymoronic title. Bekmambetov doesnt hide from it but rather leans on it encouraging more giggles than are strictly necessary. Still Walker makes for a weirdly uncharismatic hero particularly when hes on screen with his mentor Henry (Dominic Cooper) who oozes intensity and menace as Lincolns martial-arts sensei. The competent supporting cast includes Jimmi Simpson as real-life Lincoln confidante Joshua Speed Alan Tudyck as Lincolns main political rival Sen. Stephen Douglas and Anthony Mackie as Lincolns freeborn African-American friend Will. The pursuit of Will by vampires intent on harvesting him as a food source plays a major role in catalyzing the films hero; at one point Will seems like Robin to Lincolns Batman. Which brings me to the one aspect of the film that doesnt really add up. (Yes only one but its kind of nagging). As with most vampire stories a bite from a vampire will turn the victim into another vampire -- unless as Adam explains the person bitten is pure of heart. Those rare unblemished souls simply die which is presumably why Lincolns mother did not become a vampire. My question then is this Why are there no black vampires? Surely there is one slave somewhere whose heart has been hardened by injustice and the lash just enough to grow fangs. Contains violence gore obscenity and brief sensuality.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Alan Markfield) Photo Alan Markfield Associated Press Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter review Succulent 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Starring Benjamin Walker Rufus Sewell Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Dominic Cooper. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The title ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" guarantees about 15 good minutes. Just on the strength and novelty of the gimmick - combining the real details of Lincolns life with a secret antivampire history - the movie was bound to command a certain absurd appeal. The trick was in getting audiences past those 15 minutes and thats what the movie does. Based on the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is a money-making stunt that its author - who also wrote the screenplay - wisely decided to treat with seriousness or at least an attitude of seriousness. Instead of getting smirky and campy and blowing out the joke in the first few scenes Grahame-Smith and director Timur Bekmambetov straight-face it. They ask themselves well what would it be like if the main struggle of Lincolns life were with vampires intent on taking over the new world? And they answer the question as realistically and soberly as they can within this loony framework. A greater Lincoln Further they invest emotionally in the conceit of the story and in Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) as a man. Imagine He didnt just save the union and free the slaves. Here was a man dedicated to the proposition that all vampires must be destroyed. That makes for an even greater Lincoln one yet more worthy of reverential treatment. Along the way Grahame-Smith comes up with a metaphor that is appropriately descriptive of slavery and flattering to the Union. In this telling the Old Confederacy was a hotbed of vampirism. Perhaps this should not come as a big surprise given that the slaveholders were sucking the life out of their slaves. The movie which makes Lincoln into an impassioned abolitionist from childhood (thats not quite accurate to history) links from the beginning Lincolns hatred of slavery to his hatred of vampirism. And oh does he hate vampires. Remember how Lincolns mother died in 1818 of a thing called milk sickness? Well its not the milk that gets her in this one. Enough said. The movie traces the rail-splitters career from his early days studying law and splitting vampires heads open to his career as a politician and later as president Just take the standard Lincoln story and add hand-to-hand vampire combat. To love and not merely appreciate ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" would require relishing the vampire battles. Here they get old quickly but then they generally end quickly too. The exceptions are two extended action sequences - one on a train another taking place amid a stampede of horses - that are clever and imaginative but so CGI happy that theyre like looking at a computer screen. It wont be long before audiences recoil from that computer-canned look the way wed reject rear projection. Computer-generated imagery can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but they cant fool all of the people all of the time. Saved by brevity Near the finish when the Lincoln/vampire gimmick is about to run out of gas brevity saves it. ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" doesnt end at the ideal place with the audience wanting more but at least it ends before the audience is ready to give up hope. As Lincoln noted stage actor Benjamin Walker is a tall lean guy with a big hat who can swing an ax. What else can be said? If he ever plays Hamlet there will be a lot more to say about him. In a role created just for the movie Rufus Sewell does the usual British villain thing (polite scary) as an ancient vampire Lincolns nemesis. Particularly welcome is the altogether fitting treatment of Mary Todd Lincoln in Mary Elizabeth Winsteads performance as an attractive vivacious young woman who becomes first lady in troubled times. Its well known that Mary Todd Lincoln got a little nutty in her later years. Now we know why.    Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Moviegoers likely arent coming for a refresher course on our 16th president or the Civil War.Which is good because they wont learn much here. Instead theyll get a stylish slasher of a movie a monster flick that does its vampires right if not their real-life counterparts.STORY Actor Benjamin Walker talks about playing AbeMORE Lincoln has history and horror in its bloodDirected by Timur Bekmambetov this film could have been a one-note snoozer propelled by a catchy title like 2006s Snakes on a Plane. And while the movie stumbles over almost anything that doesnt slurp blood credit Bekmambetov with trying to say something larger than ""walking corpses are creepy.""The film begins with an effective scene to validate its revisionist history Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) watches his mothers murder at the hands of a vampire. (For the record Nancy Lincoln died at 34 from ""milk sickness"" a common ailment at the time contracted by ingesting contaminated milk or bad beef.)About the movieAbraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter1/2 out of fourStars Benjamin Walker Anthony Mackie Rufus Sewell Director Timur BekmambetovDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for violence throughout and brief sexuality Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Opens today nationwideThe death sends Lincoln -- who looks like a young awkward Liam Neeson-- on a two-pronged mission Kill vampires and be president in that order.Hunter goes way off track after the mothers death and nearly derails with a rock-scored training montage that has become requisite viewing in any fight film. The film layers some ""history"" into the story like a brooding civil war and real-life characters at least in name including the free African-American William Johnson (the terrific Anthony Mackie) who was the presidents valet and barber back then. Here all that he shaves are the heads off marauders.The fight scenes -- especially the battle on a runaway train speckled in coal sparks -- can be spectacular. As action films go Hunter is hard to beat.But oh what it could have been. The film dances around solid themes racism nationhood the embodiment of evil vs. the spirit of good.Yet every time Hunter comes close to saying something it slips into lazy writing. Confederate soldiers arent much more likable than the vampires who side with the South of course. Union soldiers kill vampires while the Gettysburg Address is read in the background. Even its attempts at humor especially Mary Todd nagging her husband that theyll be late for the play that ultimately kills him make you wish Hunter would stick to the impalements.And for the most part it does. Despite its factual dismemberment of the movies namesake Hunter bristles as summer action fodder. Honest. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Here is the worst thing to happen to Abe Lincoln in a theater since he attended ""Our American Cousin."" The action-horror-history mashup ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" stakes out turf midway between Ken Burns and Bram Stoker. But the action is frenzy without form the history is flat cliche and theres no horror unless you count some of the performances. Everything is exactly wrong. Playing its wild premise completely straight the film positions our 16th president as a man with two driving passions disgust at slavery and hatred for vampires. The two causes combine for him at an early age when young Abe watches a smirking slaveholder (Marton Csokas) lash his little black friend Will and then sneak into the Lincoln cabin at night to tap his beloved mother Nancy like a maple tree in syrup season. As a strapping young man (now played by Benjamin Walker) hes an ideal recruit into the ages-old clandestine battle against vampirism. Abe is mentored in the lore of vamp-destruction by a renegade neck-biter (Dominic Cooper) sworn to end his bloodlines evil ways. Swinging his silver-headed ax like a samurai warrior he chops his way to victory in showers of vampire blood. Theres an inspired bats-in-the-belfry looniness to linking Confederate slave owners with literal bloodsucking. The ferociously smart premise propelled screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smiths history-twisting source novel to the top of the bestseller lists in 2010. Russian director Timur Bekmambetov attacks the material tooth and nail. His gearbox has two speeds neutral and overdrive. He pulls off a couple of over-the-top action scenes; theres zany brilliance in a high-energy battle between Abe and a fangster in a thunderous horse stampede. The horror aspects of the film evade him; his fright effects are more disgusting than scary. There are some giggles for history majors here introducing Lincolns close friend (some would say intimate friend) Joshua Speed into the tale and making his political rival Stephen Douglas into Mary Todds possessive boyfriend. But where ""Inglourious Basterds"" recombobulated World War II history into wild pop fantasy Bekmambetov lacks the wit to make this work as thinking persons trash. Theres a void at the movies center. Abe just isnt interesting. We get none of his humor none of his pragmatic complexity and Walker is better at looking grave than really acting. By the time he faces off against the head of the Souths undead legions (a smug dissipated Rufus Sewell) you yearn for the spunky originality of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer."" Amid all the artery-spurting gore one wonders if even the undead can be bored to extinction.

Granted one wish Merida must rely on her bravery and her archery skills to undo a beastly curse. Video courtesy of Pixar. By Joe Morgenstern Updated June 21 2012 656 p.m. ET For the first time in ""Brave"" Pixar has made an animated feature with a female protagonist--a young Scottish princess Merida with incendiary red hair a sweetly independent swagger a talent for archery and a thirst for adventure. Thats a good first and long overdue but theres another one that isnt good at all. ""Brave"" is the first film under Pixars banner that teaches life lessons through insistent preachments instead of letting dramatic events speak for themselves. The most obvious lesson for Merida is to be careful what you wish for since one of her wishes goes horribly wrong and turns her kingdom upside down forcing her to find the bravery that will put things right. The most important lesson for the audience is to be clear about what you expect. This is less a film in the lustrous Pixar tradition than a Disney fairy tale told with Pixars virtuosity. As such its enjoyable consistently beautiful fairly conventional occasionally surprising and ultimately disappointing. ENLARGE Merida voiced by Kelly Macdonald in Brave. Disney/Pixar The issue of expectations is unavoidable since the films marketing campaign like the early passages of the film itself suggests a feminist fable of a young warrior going off to fight her own battles--thus the iconic poster image of the heroine alone in a forest bow and arrow at the ready. For a while Merida (voiced superbly by Kelly Macdonald) does indeed struggle against constraints that threaten her freedom tight dresses boobish suitors arbitrary dictates of etiquette and worst of all a strict mother who insists that a princess should always strive for perfection. And Merida does make a break for it on an escape route that takes her through spectacular settings--one memorable shot finds her standing tall atop a towering rock pedestal--then plunges her into a shady green glade where blue will o the wisps shimmer seductively. Suddenly however the saga takes a sharp turn into witchery wishes and a magical spell--a notably confusing spell prompted by vague plotting--and ""Brave"" becomes a story not of a rebellious daughter but of the bonds between daughter and mother in magical circumstances. The only thing Ill note of those circumstances is that they lead to encounters of genuine tenderness humor and complexity as well as affecting role-reversals in which the child takes care of the parent. So whats to be said against the familiar theme of a mother and daughter establishing a new relationship on the basis of new understandings? First off the theme is at odds with what precedes it. And the familiarity breeds dismay for the last thing weve come to expect from a Pixar film is tried-and-true family-friendly formulations. (The voice cast includes Emma Thompson Billy Connolly Julie Walters and Robbie Coltrane.) ""Brave"" was a notoriously troubled production with a change of directors that clearly led to a change of narrative direction. (The complexity of the final credits reflects the tortuous history directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman and co-directed by Steve Purcell from a script written by Messrs. Andrews and Purcell Ms. Chapman and Irene Mecchi.) That raises the question of how much this Disney-esque fable was influenced by Disney which used to be Pixars distributor and is now the studios owner. Theres no way to know and its certainly premature to panic about Pixars fate. The studio that has given us such animated masterpieces as the ""Toy Story"" trilogy ""Finding Nemo"" and ""WALLE"" may well have a host of untold wonders in its pipeline. At the same time though there is reason to be concerned--not because of the failings of ""Brave"" which is a pleasant entertainment on its own terms but because of the singular promise that Pixar represents in a dimming firmament of entertainment conglomerates. ENLARGE Benjamin Walker in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. Twentieth Century Fox Abraham Lincoln the 16th President of the United States discovers vampires are planning to take over the United States. He makes it his mission to eliminate them. Video courtesy of Fox. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter If I understand this history lesson correctly and I fear that I do Honest Abe fitted his rail-splitting ax with a silver edge that was better suited to the vanquishing of vampires; the Civil War was fought over bodily fluids (the Confederate Army having been beefed up so to speak by vampires who valued the Souths slaves as a source of blood) and the Norths secret weapon was melted-down silverware. What I dont understand is why this extended piece of idiocy chose to sink its stinky teeth into our 16th president. If an axe-wielding hero was required George Washington would have been the better choice with the Redcoats as bloodsuckers. Preposterous premises have been the basis of deathless classics from ""Metropolis"" to ""Planet of the Apes."" The problem here isnt idiocy per se but idiocy sans levity; someone forgot to tell the filmmakers--the director Timur Bekmambetov and his co-producer Tim Burton--that the movie was supposed to be fun. Or at least smart. At certain points the script seems poised to develop a parallel between vampires and racists--the story is mainly set in the years before the Civil War--but thats pretty much lost in recurrent stampedes of slavering predators. Fleeting rewards turn up from time to time Benjamin Walkers Lincoln learning kung fu or twirling his ax--the handle of which conceals a gun--like a demented drum major; Mary Elizabeth Winsteads Mary Todd standing on top of the stovepipe hat that Abe had dropped in order to kiss him; a computer-generated vista of a foundry melting down the forks that will save the Union. But Anthony Mackie one of Americas finest actors is utterly wasted in the role of Will Johnson Lincolns friend from childhood; theres only so much a star can do with banal material. And much as I tried to keep my sense of humor while watching a movie that has none I lost it during a sequence that cuts between Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address and Union troops stabbing the vampires with you know what to win the battle. ENLARGE Judy Davis Woody Allen and Alison Pill in To Rome With Love. Sony Pictures Classics To Rome With Love For better or worse Woody Allen turns out a movie every year. Last years ""Midnight in Paris"" was better than better; that is to say sublime. ""To Rome With Love"" is worse than worse as inert as its predecessor was inspired. How to explain the inexplicable? For all we know the answer could be contractual--an obligation if not to others then to himself to go into production when he didnt have a movie worth doing. Woody Allen directed this film that revolves around Italians expats and the romances adventures and predicaments they get into in the ""Eternal city"". Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. Whats on screen is a collection of cliches intermingled with outlandish farce or surreal fantasy. The cliches starting with the title seem to have been set forth in the hope that we would identify them as cliches but find them fragrant all the same A young American tourist for example finds the Italian man of her dreams at the Trevi fountain. The farce elements excel only in ineptitude. In one Italian newlyweds arrive from the provinces then lose track of each other for an implausible reason with disastrous results. The surrealism is perpetrated mainly by Roberto Benigni insufferably self-enchanted in the role of a Roman nobody who suddenly finds himself a prime celebrity. The fantasy turns on Alec Baldwin as an American architect revisiting a Roman neighborhood where he lived as an ardent young man. Hovering over the action like the stage manager in ""Our Town"" the architect tries to cut through the pretensions of three young lovers but that only makes the prevailing pretentiousness more intense. The cast as almost always in Mr. Allens films is an extraordinary one that includes Penelope Cruz Judy Davis Ellen Page Greta Gerwig Jesse Eisenberg and the filmmaker himself who appears to be playing a bad version of one of the many surrogates who have played him annoyingly. The cinematographer was the excellent Darius Khondji whose work is often distinguished by deep burnished tones. In the spirit of this enterprise the tone is indiscriminately bright. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com ENLARGE Toy Story 2 (1999) Some troubled productions remain so their flaws all too evident in the final product. This one turned out to be a triumph the rare sequel that transcends a great original. Like ""Brave"" the second part of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy suffered from serious script problems. Unlike ""Brave"" the production was shut down the script was junked and Pixars writers got a new script right and then some. The director John Lasseter and his co-directors Ash Brannon and Lee Unkrich worked from a screenplay by Andrew Stanton Rita Hsiao Doug Chamberlin and Chris Webb. The Hurt Locker (2008) Anthony Mackie is Sgt. JT Sanborn one of three members of a bomb squad at the focal point of Kathryn Bigelows Oscar-winning drama which was written by Mark Boal; the others are played by Jeremy Renner and Brian Geraghty. The film manages to be many things at once--a first-rate action thriller a vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq and a penetrating study of heroism. Most of all though it is as I wrote when it came out an instant classic that demonstrates how the drug of war hooks its victims and why they cant kick the habit. You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger (2010) Coming after the delightful ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and before ""Midnight in Paris"" Woody Allens small-scale charmer set in London is a comic roundelay of amorous ambitions and delusions that lead mostly but not entirely to disaster. The cast of characters is small and largely screwy. One couple is played by Anthony Hopkins and the enchanting Gemma Jones; the other by Naomi Watts and Josh Brolin. Its touching to watch everyones struggles and instructive to discover that the screwiest people on screen are the only ones who find true happiness. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter a bloody mess Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview A bloody relentless Abraham Lincoln Vampire HunterMore wit and less whacking might have improved the Timur Bekmambetov-directed mash-up tale of Lincolns obsession with the undead.June 21 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Benjamin Walker as Abraham LIncoln and Erin Wasson in ""Abraham Lincoln... (Stephen Vaughan / 20th Century...)History remembers him as Honest Abe Father Abraham the Great Emancipator even the Illinois Rail Splitter. But""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter""? Who knew?Now the secret life of the 16th president of the United States and his passion for ridding the world of ""immortal blood sucking demons"" is revealed for all to see. In 3-D no less.It turns out that it wasnt just the lack of air-conditioning that made Lincoln miserable in the fetid air of 1860sWashington D.C. it was all the undead he had to eradicate before the slaves could be freed and the Union made whole. Thats enough to raise a sweat in any man.All this information comes courtesy of Seth Grahame-Smith who wrote the original mash-up novel as well as the screenplay of the new film relentlessly directed by Timur Bekmambetov. Given the subject matter an exercise in delicacy and restraint was unlikely but its too bad that the films concept is way more entertaining than what has ended up on-screen."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;For the creative team behind this Abe endeavor has decided to take things completely seriously to insist that these Lincoln vs. vampire shenanigans are in the directors words ""a manifestation of the real drama the real nightmare the country went through which was slavery."" Right.And though care was taken to make sure that the films Civil War props were authentic ""Vampire Hunters"" tone is unapologetically savage. Even the occasional runaway train is not enough to hide the fact that a movie consisting of multiple vampire attacks quickly gets repetitive and exhausting. Not to mention very very bloody.Bekmambetov whose previous works include the Russian ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"" and Angelina Jolies ""Wanted"" is not one to shy away from the brutal. Although the films use of 3-D is mostly pedestrian its at its most effective when those vampires and their grotesque dentures provide enough ""open wide"" moments to unnerve a team of Beverly Hills orthodontists.""Vampire Hunters"" dramatic intentions are way ahead of its ability to execute them so even capable actors such as Dominic Cooper Anthony Mackie Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Rufus Sewell dont make much of an impression. And star Benjamin Walker in his first significant film role doesnt do much more than look appropriately lantern-jawed and determined.Before all these adults get their chance on-screen back we go to Lincolns childhood in Indiana when he sees his best friend beaten for being black and watches in horror as local vampire Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) does in young Abes beloved mother.Lincoln vows revenge but being already dead vampires are difficult to kill. This and other pertinent information is passed on to the young man by Henry Sturges (Cooper) a determined vampire hunter who knows and tells all.Soon enough the powerfully built former rail-splitter is swinging his custom-built silver-bladed ax like there was no tomorrow a which for the vampires who get in his way happens to be the truth.Lincoln also reveals himself to be perhaps the only master of slick Asian martial arts moves a the films fight scenes were choreographed by the Acting School of Fighting Kun-Do in far-off Kazakhstan a to be raised in an Indiana log cabin. Go figure.Moving to Springfield Ill. Lincoln disregards Sturges advice to avoid personal entanglements by wooing the comely Mary Todd (Winstead) and re-establishing his childhood friendship with Will Johnson (Mackie).He also comes to the attention of the one-named vampire-in-chief Adam (Sewell) said to be 5000 years old give or take.

But at least when the Kazakh director does so the wheels have glistening silver rims and spin in hyperdetailed superslow motion all while the car is spinning through the air in a graceful arcing corkscrew. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter has no cars of course but there are plenty of those post-Matrix action stylings the director likes so much. Theres so little variation from his past work here though that the film seems cobbled together with spare parts from his Hollywood debut the curving-bullet Angelina Jolie actioner Wanted and the cult Russian vampire movie that put him on the U.S. radar Night Watch. To say that its an exercise in style over substance is perhaps an overstatement in that it suggests theres any substance here at all. But oh what style. This Abraham Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) -- sprung tall and lanky from Seth Grahame-Smiths best-selling novel which he adapts here for the screen -- wields a silver-plated ax with the baton-twirling expertise of a vigilante drum major driven by a single-minded desire to exact vengeance on the vampire who killed his mother when he was a boy. When he puts that ax into action time slows down and Bekmambetov tracks his killing strokes in a ballet of digital blood and dismemberment. Grahame-Smiths story takes the basic chronology and facts of Lincolns life and reshapes them to fit around a secret identity as a vampire hunter trained in his calling by a do-gooder vampire named Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). The slave trade in America is explained as a vampire plot to create a captive food supply; Lincolns time working in an Illinois general store -- in reality he co-owned it though in the film hes just a clerk -- sets up a solitary home base for his vampire assassinations. The Civil War itself becomes a war against vampires allied with the Confederacy each of those factions with its own interest in keeping slavery intact. Apparently despite being adapted by the author the film strays far from Grahame-Smiths original text yet it still feels very much like a movie adapted from a novel -- and poorly adapted at that. The pacing is as disjointed and jumpy as Bekmambetovs action sequences are fluid and orderly as if entire chunks of detailed novelistic narrative were simply excised to make room for more action. i Abraham Lincoln with Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a friendly member of the undead who trains Lincoln as a vampire hunter. Stephen Vaughan/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Stephen Vaughan/20th Century Fox Abraham Lincoln with Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a friendly member of the undead who trains Lincoln as a vampire hunter. Stephen Vaughan/20th Century Fox A couple of those set pieces do go a long way toward making the movie watchable particularly a legitimately thrilling fight between Lincoln and the vampire leader a wealthy plantation owner named Adam (Rufus Sewell) that takes place amid a massive stampede of horses. The special effects artists use the cloud of dust kicked up by the thundering hooves to obscure the artificiality of the CGI horses giving it a dirty visceral feel that much of the rest of the film wrapped in a slick digital sheen often lacks. For all the attention paid to the meticulously constructed look of the film its remarkable how truly awful some of the production values are. Walker wears a prosthetic nose so obviously fake that one expects someone to walk up to him rip it off and reveal him to be an impostor Lincoln. The aging makeup used for Lincoln and Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) during his presidency is so slipshod that Winstead in particular seems barely able to move her face to speak -- as if shes injected some 19th-century Botox progenitor that causes skin to sag before it atrophies. And while that horse chase may be a highlight the films climactic train chase is so artificial-looking that one wonders if someone forgot to cut the last few checks to the usually reliable effects wizards at Weta Digital. Add to that massive lapses in the plausibility of some sequences and the whole thing collapses into an incoherent mess. Yes I recognize the irony of making believability complaints in a film about Abraham Lincoln fighting vampires but the logistics the filmmakers try to pass off as possible -- particularly involving Lincolns plan to turn the tide at the Battle of Gettysburg -- are insults to basic common sense even within this manufactured alternate universe. Whatever spark of originality caused Grahame-Smiths book to become a runaway success has burned out entirely here snuffed by Bekmambetovs slavish dedication to looking cool.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday July 3 2012 1203 AM Title Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Film Info R Violence. Area theaters. In 3-D. In the title sequence of the great early-80s comedy series ""Police Squad"" Abraham Lincoln is seen dodging Booths bullet at the Ford Theater then turning and firing James Bond-style. That level of wit could have saved ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" As it is this insipid mashup of history lesson and monster flick takes itself semi-seriously which is truly deadly. RELATED LINCOLN STAKES CLAIM TO VAMPIRE HORROR Adapted from screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smiths nudge-nudge wink-wink book the film begins in Lincolns youth when the well-known loss of his mother apparently comes about because of a vampire attack. How can you tell theyre the undead? Well they follow the Gary Oldman ""Dracula"" model and wear funky blue-tinted sunglasses the only people in antebellum America to be concerned with looking stylin. Abe grows up to be awkward young Mr. Lincoln (Benjamin Walker a dead ringer for ""Darkman""-era Liam Neeson) trained to kill vampires by the mysterious Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper). Their weapon is silver Henry imparts due to gobbledygook about Judas 30 pieces of silver. After seeking out the beast who took his mother Lincoln puts away his silver-tipped axe. Then Henry needs the 6-foot-4 congressman nicknamed ""The Rail-splitter"" to have a shadow career alongside politics in order to stop the vampire overlord Adam (Rufus Sewell). And thus the bearded Lincoln beheads vampires while wearing his stovepipe hat. ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is too dumb to even qualify as guilty fun and seems more like an ""SNL"" skit. There are shots of Lincoln goring fanged adversaries then giving famous speeches. The Gettysburg Address follows a gruesome vamp defeat and Mary Todd Lincoln -- not known to be the most comely of First Ladies -- is hilariously babe-ified by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. And Stephen Douglass introduction is a real howler. The movies er somewhat dodgy back story about slavery being used throughout the ages by vampires to secure food comes off not as post-politically correct horror-flick fodder but semi-insensitive jokesterism. If the movie werent so full of flying CG bodies and ludicrous line readings it might be more offensive. But then in the final moments Mary calls ""Abe well be late for the theater"" Is this all a setup for a new comedy series?

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> And you thought Honest Abe spent most of his time wrestling the Confederacy and trying to free the slaves. Ha The bestseller list teaches a different history. It was the spawn of Twilight our 16th President was after. Seth Grahame-Smith following his 2009 book success with Pride and Prejudice and Zombies came up with Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter and hit the charts again this time by mashing up vamps with real Lincoln history. It was a fun escapist read. The movie version with a script co-written by Grahame-Smith is almost no fun at all even as young Abe declares war on vampires for killing his beloved mom. Thats because Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted) wont leave a good gimmick alone. He lucked out big time nabbing Benjamin Walker to play Lincoln from 8 to 80 (not exactly but you get my point). Walker 30 was a dick-swinging smash on Broadway in the 2010 musical Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson playing Old Hickory as a genocidal horror in sexy pants. Walker brings backbone and flashes of humor to the guy on the five-dollar bill. But Walker cant save Bekmambetov from his own worst instincts. Just when the story sort of gets going with Abe aligned with good vampire Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) against evil bloodsuckers played by Rufus Sewell and Marton Csokas Bekmambetov brings out Abe to swing his silver-tipped axe and decapitate every vamp in sight with the athletic abandon of a contestant on So You Think You Can Dance. It looks fine the first two or three times you see it then the acrobatic repetition seeps in and bores you breathless. The tacky retro-fitted 3D doesnt help either. Spare Walker who deserves to go on to better things. But the movie deserves a stake through the heart.

Alan Markfield Anthony Mackie (left) and Benjamin Walker in ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter."" 20th Century Fox Alan Markfield photo The concept sounds like a joke that should fizzle but the horror/history mashup ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is a blast the best action movie of the summer.Young Abe Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) is an avenger with something to avenge -- the murder of his mother at the hands of a bloodsucking debt collector (Marton Csokas). This particular parasite has actual fangs and the strapping lad from a log cabin proves to be no match for the vampire.But Abes honesty attracts a mysterious mentor Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who teaches him to use the Force. Lincolns light saber is an ax and he wields it against vampires posing as ordinary citizens of Springfield. The clever twist taken from the source novel by Seth Grahame-Smith is that the vampires support slavery and are fanning the flames of secessionism that will lead to the Civil War. In the midst of debating states rights with Stephen Douglas (Alan Tudyk) Lincoln meets the great orators companion Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). She will will soon become the First Lady of the United States -- without realizing that her gentle husband moonlights as an assassin.With its swooshing weapons and stylized gore this 3D flick was identifiably directed by Timur Bekmambetov the Russian whose hitman movie ""Wanted"" was a guilty pleasure in 2008. ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is less guilty with a surprisingly respectful tone toward American values and their most heroic proponent but no less pleasurable. The battlefield scenes are suitably epic and the CGI climax on a runaway train looks like it cost a Confederate fortune. But theres warm human blood behind the action scenes in the person of Walker a towering actor who looks like a young Liam Neeson and never stoops to caricature. It should be self-evident that all horror movies are not created equal. With a swift sword ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" emancipates the genre from the ""Twilight"" twerps.

Suggesting an auspicious beginning for a franchise of demon-slaying politicians (""President Evil"" anyone?) ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is a Civil War-era actioner of questionable taste and historical accuracy but surprisingly consistent entertainment value. Striking a deft balance of silly straight-faced and splattery helmer Timur Bekmambetov and writer Seth Grahame-Smith spin an agreeably daft fang-in-cheek tribute to Americas 16th president and his ax-wielding campaign to abolish a nationwide outbreak of vampirism. South-will-rise-again types may take issue with the pics vision of Confederate forces in cahoots with vicious bloodsuckers; others should lap it up spelling potent if possibly short-lived summer B.O. Pic has its roots in a 2010 novel by Grahame-Smith the genre mashup artist responsible for the soon-to-be-filmed ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies""; he also co-wrote the recent ""Dark Shadows"" (whose director Tim Burton is credited as a producer here). The scribe has efficiently streamlined his text into a down-and-dirty 105-minute item that barrels ahead like a locomotive perhaps on the assumption that its cheerfully ridiculous premise doesnt merit prolonged scrutiny. Yes and no actually. The opening passages set in early 19th-century Indiana establish how young Abe (Lux Haney-Jardine) developed an all-consuming hatred of vampires. Well you would too if they killed your mother and treated the Southern slave trade as their personal food supply. As a tall strapping young man (played by Benjamin Walker) hellbent on destroying his moms demonic assassin (Marton Csokas) Abe is recruited by the mysterious Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) who not only supplements Abes law studies with an intense fitness regimen but also teaches him how to vanquish these monsters never mind that they can turn invisible and move faster than William Howard Taft in a buffet line. In a key twist conveniently borrowed from werewolf lore silver (not stakes) is Henrys recommended weapon of choice and so with the help of a silver-bladed ax a gun loaded with silver bullets and a few moves apparently on loan from ""The Matrix"" Abe is soon gutting bloodsuckers left and right. He also catches the eye of the fetching Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) but temporarily spurns her affections; after all the lowly vampire hunter is doomed to a lonely life of self-imposed bachelorhood not unlike Spider-Man or James Buchanan. Still its not long before this Lincoln lawyer is happily married with child installed in the White House and embroiled in a very bloody Civil War. Dovetailing the historical and the supernatural the script hinges on the metaphoric linking of two unholy scourges slavery and vampirism. Its a thin but effective conceit sealed by the mildly incendiary image of noted Confederate leader Jefferson Davis (John Rothman) bargaining with New Orleans-based vampire honcho Adam (Rufus Sewell). If anything ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" could have used more of that casually shocking character-assassinating dark humor though its unexpected secret weapon is how effectively it often plays as straight drama. Indeed the picture works in no small part by applying a sheen of irreverently reverent mythology to one of the most lionized figures in American history a physically imposing proto-superhero who here gets to decapitate and disembowel the most bankable movie monsters of the moment. There isnt a trace of irony to the way Walker channels Lincoln his look of earnest square-jawed determination shining through even from under a beard a stovepipe hat and several layers of old-age makeup. He and Winstead strike remarkably poignant chords -- no small achievement for a movie whose most memorably gratuitous action setpiece brings to mind a demented cross between a wuxia epic and a wild horse stampede. Bekmambetov who proved himself a dab hand at vampire thrillers (""Night Watch"" ""Day Watch"") before he directed the 2008 graphic-novel adaptation ""Wanted"" handles the violence in an arresting if flashily impersonal style. The early fight sequences during which Abe impulsively seeks out trouble have a creepily measured tension that largely vanishes in the later skirmishes shot as a series of cool-looking but increasingly tiresome slo-mo ballets punctuated by eruptions of black blood (the scenes were conceived by Kazakh fight choreographer Igor Tsay and his Acting School of Fighting Kun-Do). Always on the move and disinclined to overstay its welcome ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is almost good enough to make one wish it had been conceived and executed with a bit more care or pushed to goofier and/or more visceral extremes. The period look is serviceable but a bit drab and the 3D conversion does little to enhance Caleb Deschanels sepia-heavy widescreen images. William Hoys editing has fun with some violently whooshing scene transitions; naturally the soundtrack wouldnt be complete without some Linkin Park.

And with ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" the whole joke is in the title. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Bad Director Timur Bekmambetov. Cast Benjamin Walker Dominic Cooper Rufus Sewell Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Rating R for violence throughout and brief sexuality. Just imagine it -- our stately spindly and much-beloved 16th president doffing his trademark stovepipe hat and tearing into a ravenous horde of the undead lobbing off heads with a silver ax. Funny right? Except thats not what this movie is. Based on the book by Seth Grahame-Smith (who kickstarted the whole historical monster mashup craze with 2009s ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") the film explores Lincolns younger years starting with his childhood. Enraged over the racial inequality that suppresses his best friend who happens to be Black Lincoln stands up to his oppressors and it gets him into trouble with what turns out to be a vampire. The vampire retaliates by killing Lincolns mother setting the future president on a dual path of revenge and emancipation. He soon grows into a strapping man and a dead ringer for young Liam Neeson. Therein lies much of the movies mirthlessness Its one thing to watch Abraham Lincoln kill vampires; its quite another to watch some hot dude with a six-pack do it. Unrealistically attractive young Abe happens across Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a Van Helsing-like figure and professional vampire hunter who over the course of a heavily filtered montage reminiscent of ""Kill Bill"" teaches the vengeance-bound man how to wield an ax and fight in slow motion then sends him on his merry way to kill as many vampires as possible. And he kills a lot of them. Some of the early deaths are entertaining -- inventive beheadings shocking geysers of blood -- but in the end there are only so many ways to swing an ax in slow motion. It doesnt help that the film bites off more than its special-effects budget can chew. Vampires are all teeth and snarling CGI looking more like werewolves with a head cold than Dracula. Sprawling set pieces constructed on computer screens fall flat once they hit the big screen and theres a particularly risible battle sequence set on the backs of stampeding horses; video-game consoles are capable of rendering better graphics. Meanwhile theres something like a plot unfolding in the background with Lincolns ascendency to the presidency patched together through a series of sobering voice-overs in the form of letters and diary entries. Effective in a Ken Burns documentary pointless here. Only occasionally does the movie shake off the torpor. Theres some cleverness in the historical revisionism that has vampires conscripted to the Confederacy in defense of slavery (slaves being their primary food source) turning the Civil War into a literal fight of Good vs. Evil. Jefferson Davis plotting Gettysburg battle tactics with the undead? Awesome. But those moments are too few and far between. The filmmakers have approached this high-camp concept with a straight face sucking all the fun out of a geeky romp and leaving behind an oddly joyless slog that rarely seems to be in on the joke of itself.

"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; abraham-lincoln-vampire-hunter ) Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (United States 2012) June 21 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Nearly 150 years after his assassination Abraham Lincoln is getting his due from Hollywood. 2012 sees the release of three movies featuring the 16th President front-and-center. The biggest of these is Steven Spielbergs long-awaited bio-pic due to reach screens during Oscar season. Then theres a pair of curious similarly-themed films both of which feature Lincoln in the role of an undead-destroyer. The first a low-budget exploitation flick Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies may have made a brief theatrical stop in a few theaters on its way to DVD. The higher-profile effort pits the bearded Chief Executive against bloodsuckers who neither sparkle in the sunlight nor look longingly at underage girls. History students however would be warned not to take Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter at face value. Perhaps surprisingly the only joke in the film is in the title. One expects a movie called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter to be rich in wit and black humor but writer Seth Grahame-Smith (adapting from his more satirical novel) and director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted) opt to play things reasonably straight. The result is a hybrid horror/action endeavor that offers Lincoln as a 19th century superhero. Bakmambetovs stylistic fingerprints are all over Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter; the action scenes are intense and utilize techniques made popular by The Matrix and 300. Visually its hard to complain about Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (with a caveat that will be discussed later). The climactic train sequence in particular is eye-popping. Grahame-Smith burst on the literary scene with his pastiche Pride and Prejudice and Zombies which sounds more clever than it is. More an amusing and satirical exercise than a genuine novel its success paved the way for Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter which can claim a semi-original story. The adaptation condenses a lot of history and fiction and curiously leaves out one of the strongest elements of the book the ending. For history buffs its best to think of this as taking place in a parallel universe. For those who know anything about the Civil War the existence of vampires is less likely to be a sticking point than the gross liberties taken with established historical personalities and events. The first half of the movie which follows Lincolns early career as a politician and vampire hunter is the films strongest segment. Honest Abe is played by Benjamin Walker a relatively unknown actor who bears an uncanny resemblance to a young Liam Neeson. (Irony alert for many years Neeson was attached as the lead for Spielbergs Lincoln but he withdrew when the movie went into production believing himself to be too old.) Lincoln has a grudge against vampires for killing his mother and his botched attempt to eliminate her murderer Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) leads him to Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) veteran vampire hunter. Lincoln becomes his apprentice. He then moves to Springfield where he enters politics romances Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and kills vampires. For about 45 minutes Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter plays like a period piece superhero movie. Things get muddled following a time-jump to the 1860s. Apparently the Civil War in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is all about slaves being used as vampire food. The South is infested by vampires with the undead leader called ""Adam"" (Rufus Sewell) shown as being closely allied with Jefferson Davis. At Gettysburg Lincoln figures out a way to beat back the vampires and this turns the tide of the war. Never mind that the ultimate solution is preposterous; it makes for a great action sequence. When it comes to the acting I have no complaints. Walker is perfectly credible as Lincoln - tall stiff-backed and rather dour. Dominic Cooper Anthony Mackie and Jimmi Simpson are solid as his companions. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who I have liked since I first noticed her in Sky High) gives us the most attractive Mary Todd Lincoln ever. (Compare to a photograph.) And Rufus Sewell oozes cold cultured calculated evil. Too bad hes not given sufficient opportunity to really shine. Now we get to the point of the review where I discuss the 3-D conversion. For the vast majority of 3-D endeavors the format is just a means to tack on a surcharge and force viewers to wear sunglasses. It neither adds to nor detracts from the movies quality. For a very small number of films it can enhance or damage the experience. Sadly Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a member of the latter category. Both Bekmambetovs visual sense and Caleb Deschanels cinematography are victimized by what may be the worst post-conversion abomination to-date. Its bad. Really bad. Move aside Clash of the Titans theres a new king in town. The 3-D doesnt even attempt to bring real depth to the field of vision. It divides everything into about five planes and forces images onto these. There are multiple occasions when foreground objects are out-of-focus and at times partially transparent. Its hard to say whether the inconsistencies in color desaturation from scene-to-scene are the result of Bekmambetovs style or the incompetent conversion. The 3-D is so awful as to be distracting. Theres a sequence involving a lot of horses that is degraded into incoherence by the 3-D. I review what Im given but Im convinced I would have enjoyed Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter significantly more in 2-D. If you intend to see this movie do not support the 3-D version. Theaters should be paying viewers to see it in this format not the other way around. With its strong visual sense and high concentration on action and violence Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter plays like a graphic novel. It has that sensibility. Its not overly concerned with history and the filmmakers seem to actively hope no one in the audience knows a thing about Gettsyburg or what The Underground Railroad really was. (Hint it had nothing to do with trains.) Theres also an assumption that audience members are geographically challenged and that theyre not concerned with things like the passage of time. On the whole the movie relies a little too much on its unique conceit getting a lot of mileage out of the idea that President 16 had more on his plate than what is recorded by history books. The concept of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is worthy of a good chuckle or two but the execution proves that sometimes a clever title does not beget a production of equal value.

There have been outraged academic mutterings that the new movie ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" is a pox upon history and an insult to the 16th president of the United States. Its that of course -- actually thats the point -- but this joyless deafening cinematic headache commits a different crime. Its a sin against entertainment.The film has been adapted from the novel by Seth Grahame-Smith who made a tidy sum in 2009 by mashing up classic literature and midnight-movie horror in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" was the follow-up and in general Grahame-Smith is good enough at what he does to keep the gag going longer than youd think. His Lincoln is a pillar of moral rectitude and a whiz with a silver-tipped ax dispatching hordes of the undead who have colonized the Southern slave states for the cheap food source.To stand a chance of pulling this off on film you need wit and a deft touch and boy is Timur Bekmambetov the wrong man for the job. (Tim Burton who produced would have been the better choice.) The director came out of Russia some years back with a pair of showy fantasy thrillers ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"" and has since made the Angelina Jolie shoot-em-up ""Wanted."" Bekmambetovs filmmaking style manages to be both frantic and ponderous and he has the humor of a nightclub bouncer. The movie plays like a joke badly translated from another language.The story line follows the hero from childhood when he witnesses his mothers (Robin McLeavy) death at the hands of the vampire slave-trader Barts (Marton Csokas) all the way to the end of the Civil War. Early on Abe (Benjamin Walker) receives training in vampire-killing from the mysterious Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) and the many many fight scenes are choreographed with hectic editing slow-motion backflips and generous spewings of black vampire blood. Bekmambetov may be the last director still working who thinks 3-D means you have to throw everything at the camera bullets slavering fangs decapitated heads.Walker (who came to fame starring in Broadways ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson"") is actually very good as Lincoln giving the part a youthful gravitas and keeping a straight face during the mayhem. The rest of the cast looks embarrassed to be here including Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a dewy Mary Todd Lincoln Anthony Mackie as Lincolns boyhood friend and presidential adviser Will Jimmi Simpson as colleague Joshua Speed and Rufus Sewell as the leader of the undead. Only the impish actor Alan Tudyk finds the right playful spirit as a briefly seen Stephen A. Douglas. In general the movies attitude toward recorded history is that of a pimp toward a hooker.""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" works itself up to a number of bombastic action set-pieces all so heavily digitized that believability is never an option. One of them is the Battle of Gettysburg and please dont think about the thousands of men who actually died there if you dont want to be vaguely ill.On top of it all the movies intensely ugly to look at. The renowned cinematographer Caleb Deschanel has apparently been handed a consumer-grade camcorder and told to do his best; the images have the hot overlit feel of a community cable production. (The sets and costumes are convincing at least.) Id say this thundering bore represents a missed opportunity but thats giving the idea of pillaging the past for thrills and profit more credit than it deserves. No one puts a stake through this movie more effectively than its own director.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Grahame-Smith was the guy an editor named Jason Rekulak tapped to write a book called Pride and Prejudice and Zombies. When that sold a million copies Grahame-Smith extended the suddenly burgeoning literary-mashup franchise with his own Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter positing that our 16th President fought the Civil War against an army of slave-sucking vampires. (READ Lev Grossmans book review of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter) Actually that cocktail of historical biography and low-genre setting was even less original than it sounds. In 2001 some kids in Canada made Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter a no-budget action-horror-Mexican-wrestling musical about the Messiahs battle to save Ottawas lesbians from their undead overlords. No matter Hollywood is hot to make films from any book comic book or matchbook about vampires (or zombies). Hence this weeks 3-D movie hybrid ALVH. (FIND Corlisss critique of Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter in the Top 12 Jesus Movies) The movie seems designed for an odd demographic people who are students of both Dawn of the Dead and Doris Kearns Goodwin. It could pass for one of the hundreds of respectful Lincoln bio-pics if only Abe (Benjamin Walker) didnt take time out from courting Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and saving the Union to wield a silver axe against ravenous monsters. The estimable Kazakh director Timur Bekmambatov -- who made two spiffy modern-day vampire movies Night Watch and Day Watch in Russia then came West to helm the fabulous thriller Wanted from Mark Millars graphic novel -- has devoted a tone of ferocious solemnity and a ton of unneeded craft to making this strange concoction plausible. To not all that much avail. (READ a Corliss paean to Timur Bekmanbetovs Wanted) Things that ALVH says we didnt know about Lincoln Abe saw his mother killed by the vampire Jack Barts (Martin Csokas) and swore to avenge her death by slaughtering all of Barts kind; as a young man he met a career vampire hunter Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) who trained him in the lore of the craft; he learned that Barts was a servant of the bloodsucker-in-chief Adam (Rufus Sewell) and his aide-de-vamp Vadoma (Erin Wasson) who dwelled in Louisiana and used African slaves not as field workers but as food; he befriended a black freeman Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie) who became Lincolns closest Presidential adviser; and he waged the Civil War in part to rid the nation of its secret vampire plague. Oh and Jefferson Davis was in cahoots with Adam; the rebel army was manned or thinged mostly by vampires. In writing the screenplay Grahame-Smith junked much of his own book. He excised many of the novels characters (Ann Rutledge Edgar Allan Poe John Wilkes Booth) and streamlined the novels picaresque plot. The movie focuses on four periods in Lincolns life his youth when he sees his mother killed; his late teenage years when he takes up vampire-hunting as a vocation; his early manhood in Springfield where he meets Mary Todd; and his Presidency where (in a climax not in the book) the fate of the Union rests on getting a train through to Gettysburg despite an infestation of the Southern undead. (READ Corlisss review of Dark Shadows scripted by Grahame-Smith) Some very gifted artisans have fooled themselves into thinking they were making art. ALVH looks and often plays like a Sundance movie about creatures of the night. Caleb Deschanel the great veteran cinematographer (The Black Stallion The Right Stuff) and in his spare time Zooeys dad swathes the movie in a desaturated often sepia tinge as if in the 19th century America couldnt yet afford full color -- and the tripod hadnt been invented to keep the camera from shaking. The attractive little-known cast devotes full vigor to their roles. Csokas liberated from his pruny-swain roles in Alice in Wonderland and The Debt gives Barts a seedy grandeur and an aristocratic smirk. Sewell once the young dreamboat of Tom Stoppards superb Arcadia in its London premiere makes a suitably menacing and weary chief villain. Wasson is a seductive predator and Cooper excellent as a courtly version of the grizzled gunslinger from old Westerns. (READ Lily Rothmans interview with Benjamin Walker) Walker who turns 30 today is known to Broadway audiences for playing another President in the recent emo-rock bio-musical Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson where he prepped for his big movie role by shouting the signature line ""I will make them all bleed"" Looking like a young Liam Neeson (in Kinsey he played the 19-year-old version of Neesons character) who over the course of the film ages into Sam Waterston Walker has an impossible task to play our gravest President as an action hero. Toward the end he has trouble acting through the old-Abe makeup but hes a wizard at wielding that magical silver axe with a pistol concealed in the handle. (READ Richard Zoglins review of Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson) It is only in the action sequences that ALVH wakes from its torpor and springs to mad life pitting Abes martial-arts expertise against the vampires crimson bites -- kung-fu vs. fang goo. If you skip seeing the movie in a theater and wait to rent the DVD youll be able to fast forward to some fine battles Abe with an undead pharmacist Abe chasing Barts across the backs of horses during a stampede Abe and Henry felling a couple dozen of Adams underlings all the adversaries massed in a train speeding toward a collapsing bridge. (Applause to fight choreographer Igor Tsay who also worked on Bekmambetovs Day Watch and to stunt coordinator Mic Rodgers.) The director may rely overmuch on the old Hong Kong movie trick of slowing down the action in mid-punch -kick or -slice but he proves that the kick-ass scenes in Wanted were no fluke. Hes an action master with a nasty bite. What he cant do is bridge the chasm of ALVHs central schizophrenic conceit. The historical epic and the monster movie run on parallel tracks occasionally colliding but never forming a coherent whole. Watching this is like flipping channels randomly between a Masterpiece Theatre drama and a splatter film on Cinemax. If youre like me youll stick with the splatter.

"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter rail-splitter head lopper ??June 21 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticThe first in what I dearly hope is a trilogy to include ""Calvin Coolidge Exorcist"" and ""George W. Bush Werewolves Is Comin"" the frenzied and occasionally diverting mashup""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" rewrites American history so that the Civil War becomes a war between humans from the North and bloodsucking fiends on the Confederate side.Big Abe wields a bloody righteous ax here an ax that conceals a mean shotgun able to plug a silver bullet into a vampires skull. Or an eye. Its cooler in the eye.There are many beheadings and throat-slicings and director Timur Bekmambetov was the hack behind the assassination lark ""Wanted"" which couldnt get enough bullets-eye-view shots repeated here. And then repeated. Followed by some repetitions of the same.A 3-D attraction ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" makes full and morally dubious use of the format starting with the first big ""wow"" shot a slave owners whip cracking against the cheek of a preteen slave boys cheek. A terrible sight but the way its photographed its also meant to be a nifty image in cinematic terms. And therefore indefensible.Adapting his own richly embroidered novel which is a lot more fun than the movie Seth Grahame-Smith (who also wrote ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") strips his book for parts and ditches the most interesting cockamamie detail and context. Straight from his rock-star portrayal of another U.S. president in the Broadway musical ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson"" Benjamin Walker is Lincoln who as a boy learns his lifes calling. His mother dies horribly at the fangs of the vampires. He swears vengeance and nearly dies in an attempt to avenge that death. But the mysterious Henry played by a movie-saving Dominic Cooper intervenes takes care of business explains the vampire lore to Abe leads him in a training montage and joins him in a lifelong quest to prevent the United States of America from tilting toward the undead.It sounds fun. Its a little fun. For a while. But Bekmanbetov shoots every killing spree like an addled gamer working that slow-down-speed-up kill-shot cliche like a maniac. The actors most of whom have a wry sense of humor (Rufus Sewell is good as Adam the granddaddy vampire) contend throughout with a director with no sense of humor at all only a sense of flip excess.And honestly the movie looks terrible. For every medium or long shot in anything resembling sunlight (though this is largely an animated film given the amount of green-screen effects) the digital zizz of the image looks like a dupe of a dupe of a dupe. This isnt ""period"" style; its just sloppy.I did enjoy a few things though. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays the dishiest-ever version of Mary Todd Lincoln. Theres a slo-mo strut toward the camera performed by Walkers Lincoln that is genuinely funny. And I adore the nutty hypocrisy of the voice-over that begins and ends the film (meant to be torn from the pages of Lincolns secret vampire-hunting journal) the line referring to how history prefers ""soaring speeches to quiet deeds.""

"Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (R) This overproduced and undercooked exercise in revisionist horror-fantasy is an assault on the senses - and your intelligence. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/21/2012 Editor rating 1 Enormous in its scope and colossal in its stupidity Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a work of revisionist history/fantasy that argues Lincoln didnt sign the Emancipation Proclamation to abolish slavery He did it to prevent vampires from taking over the country. The South you see was actually the domain of undead bloodsuckers. They had infiltrated society become immune to daylight (one of the many things that the movie is fuzzy about) and passed themselves off as friendly pharmacists or bankers or barkeeps. For food the vampires fed primarily on slaves because no one cared when they went missing. Then that meddling Lincoln (Benjamin Walker) was elected President and decided the monsters must be stopped at all costs. Oh if the slaves happened to be freed as a result that would be good too. I havent read the Seth Grahame-Smith novel that inspired Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter (the author also wrote the screenplay) but Im going to guess this premise worked much better in print. For the screen director Timur Bekmambetov (Day Watch Wanted) who is Kazakhstans answer to Michael Bay glosses over the small details -- the things that would have the movie at least passably engaging -- and opts for lots of bullet-time photography and gigantic set pieces sound and fury signifying nothing. Buffy Summers was a vampire slayer out of birthright She was born with the gift. Lincoln becomes a vampire slayer (and learns kung-fu and gymnastics and parkour) by practicing with his ax until he can chop down trees with one swing. Seriously that is the extent of his training. One of the biggest problems in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is that Lincoln (unconvincingly played by Walker who runs around looking cowed) and his wife Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead in a role that redefines the term ""thankless"") are far less interesting than their undead rivals. Thanks to The Vampire Diaries True Blood and the Twilight Saga vampires are cool now. Theyre fun to hang with and if you befriend one he wont even kill you There is a scene in the movie in which the monsters (who are led by Rufus Sewell) throw themselves a ball then feast on their unsuspecting human guests. The sequence is supposed to be frightening and repellent but instead it makes you wish the film would stay with these party animals instead of going back to the boring White House. Nothing fun ever happens there. Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was shot by the great Caleb Deschanel who has given the film a sepia tone while emphasizing the color red. Some of the 3D effects are neat -- I liked how the vampires eyes are subtly heightened so they always look absolutely crazy -- but most of them are terrible. This is one of those movies where the extra blurry dimension makes everything worse unintentionally emphasizing every last bit of computer-generated gore and decapitations. The movie has so much CGI they practically could have slapped a ""By Pixar"" label on it. In one long sequence the vampires attack a steam train carrying a supply of silver to the Union forces at Gettysburg. The set piece should have been a classic. Instead it just feels like a cutscene from Metal Gear Solid 4. At least Bekmambetov defies all known laws of physics and gravity which gives the movie a crazed anything-can-happen energy. Exactly how does a horse-driven carriage burst through a wall of a huge Southern mansion? Pshaw. Who cares how? Best to not dwell too long on any aspect of Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter or you may start to suspect the sneaky Bekmambetov was secretly making a comedy. How can anyone not bust out laughing when Mary yells out ""Abraham Were going to be late to the theater"" Cast Benjamin Walker Rufus Sewell Dominic Cooper Anthony Mackie Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Director Timur Bekmambetov. Screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith. Based on his novel. Producers Timur Bekmambetov Tim Burton Jim Lemley. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 105 minutes.

Daily Edition Login to download Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Film Review 931 PM PDT 6/20/2012 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A hybrid horror-historical actioner that gleefully warps facts to entertaining effect. TWITTER Seth Grahame-Smith adapted his own novel a genre mashup that rewrites history about the 16th president played by Benjamin Walker. Starting from a premise -- succinctly stated by the movies title -- that suggests a hybrid of history lesson and horror show Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is a mishmash of styles that might leave viewers heads spinning. Genre enthusiasts will lap up the mixture of action and fantasy while history buffs who dont mind a bit of rewriting will dig into an alternative spin on the Civil War period. Audience response initially should be robust even if closer consideration might sap some later momentum. Beginning with Lincolns Indiana childhood in the early 1800s screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith (adapting his novel which supposedly originates with Lincolns secret journal) speculates that after young Lincoln and his father dare to interfere with the slave trader Barts (Marton Csokas) who also happens to be the nexus in a large network of the undead that has infiltrated the South the vampire exacts revenge by attacking and killing the 16th presidents mother. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Lincoln seeks revenge on Barts years later as a young man (Benjamin Walker) narrowly escaping getting killed himself following the intervention of Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper) a dedicated vampire assassin. Sturges recruits Lincoln as a hunter as well training him in the arts of vampire elimination. After moving to Springfield Ill. Lincoln begins dispatching ghouls as directed by Sturges using an ax with a silver-plated blade while combining vampire hunting with his study of law. He also meets the young Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and begins courting her despite Sturges warning not to become too attached to other people and is reunited with his childhood friend William Johnson (Anthony Mackie) a former slave. After he finally gets his revenge by killing Barts hes marked for elimination by Adam (Rufus Sewell) who controls the Southern vampire horde. Lincoln temporarily sets aside his ax to marry Mary and switch his allegiance to politics as debate intensifies over the abolition of slavery. Following his election President Lincoln is brought back into direct conflict with the vampires with the onset of the Civil War when Adam and his minions side with the Confederacy in an attempt to finally take control of the country. VIDEO Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Red-Band Trailer Decapitation is Key The movies virtues and some of its miscues essentially originate with Grahame-Smiths script. Taking the conceit that the institution of slavery was a vampire-motivated plot to provide the undead with fresh blood Grahame-Smith adeptly connects Lincolns vampire vendetta with his anti-slavery crusade. Marrying this high-concept premise to a coherent narrative proves more challenging however as the tales of Lincolns vampire-slaying exploits make an awkward fit with the historical facts of his life. Following up 2008s Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov showcases Lincoln as Americas ""first superhero"" (despite his lack of any supernatural abilities) shaping the first act around the future presidents desire for retribution. The initial scenes of the young lawyer dispatching the wide variety of ghouls that seem to favor Springfield in hand-to-hand combat delivers some initial thrills that more turgid set pieces later in the film seem to lack. Bekmambetov no stranger to vampire lore after launching his own Russian franchise with Night Watch and Day Watch effectively deploys the appropriate camera moves pacing and special effects to craft an awesome action figure determined to rescue the country from a bloodsucker takeover. Caleb Deschanels cinematography profitably welds horror tropes to special effects but there are no real surprises in terms of either concept or execution and the 3D conversion seems to obscure images more than enhance them. VIDEO Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter Creators Reveal Backstory Twilight Connection Tall and lanky Walker seems like he was cast more for his potential resemblance to Lincoln than for his acting or action abilities. While he appears fairly capable -- if not especially accomplished -- handling Lincolns legendary ax slower scenes opposite Winstead and other actors tend to drag with Walkers restrained delivery and stiff demeanor. Winsteads performance as Mary is far more spirited as she flirts with Lincoln in earlier scenes and later argues with him over the fate of their family and country. The supporting cast is efficiently tasked with supporting Lincolns twin goals of destroying vampires and winning the war. At a taut 105 minutes Abraham Lincoln credibly delivers the thrills and gore it promises though its ultimately too lightweight and conventional to merit either cult or classic status.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Seth Grahame-Smiths 2010 historical mash-up novel Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter sums up its own straight-faced embrace of the ridiculous in its title but for those who dont think the core concept is over-the-top enough director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted Night Watch) ups the ante considerably with his film adaptation. Now Abraham Lincoln (as played by Benjamin Walker) isnt merely an earnest young Illinois striver who learns vampires are real and spends his life fighting them both personally and politically. Instead hes a superpowered warrior-god with highly advanced axe-fu skills. When his mentor (Dominic Cooper) teaches him how to face the undead looking cool in slow motion seems to be a significantly higher classroom priority than anything else. The training montage where Lincoln learns to twirl his axe around his body like a baton for no apparent purpose is neither the movies first laughable sequence nor its last but it sums up the movies aesthetic The filmmakers mistakenly think nothing is silly if its done with a grim enough facial expression. Grahame-Smiths book Pride And Prejudice And Zombies launched the current craze for monster-infused classics (Jane Slayre Alice In Zombieland et. al.) and just as that trend was getting into gear he sidestepped with Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter which instead fuses monsters with real history. In his vision of the past American slavery represented an opportunity for vampires to own and devour human beings without compunction or limit and the Civil War was largely an effort to curb vampires control of the country. Lincoln becomes aware of vampires when one kills his mother and he grows up bitter and determined to avenge her but unaware of his enemys nature or abilities. Eventually a teacher steps in to give him the tools he needs--foremost among them a silver-edged axe and access to his inner superpowered butt-kicker--but demands Lincoln follow his strict ascetic rules in exchange. Gradually Lincoln shrugs off that guidance and makes his own choices from a relationship and child with Mary Todd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) to a political career that expands the secret vampire fight to encompass the entire country. The film version picks up on the most colorful parts of that journey eliding over large chunks of Lincolns life but lingering lovingly on the fights usually in slow motion. In particular the every-other-shot-in-slow-mo dynamic of the final confrontation seems to extend the movies run time by five minutes or so. Thats typical for Bekmambetov a visual stylist of the Zack Snyder school--every shot is lovingly set-dressed and designed to a fault but the editing is incoherent the characters are a collection of coat-racks for pretty costumes and the storyline is a checklist of familiar events and names often with a pointed pause as theyre introduced. And even for a summer action blockbuster the imagery is lazy and hacky particularly when it comes to the Symbolism For Dummies scene-setting Bats are spooky. Rain is sad. Smoke is mysterious. War is two people with flags representing the North and South running at each other yelling. Grief is a single painted glycerin tear-track lingering uncomfortably on Walkers face for a long scene. And pretty much everything is a painted-on one-pixel-deep digital surface. Further Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter frequently feels like it was hacked down from a longer movie perhaps one including scenes that were insufficiently way-awesome. Characters come and go at random particularly Alan Tudyk who shows up as Mary Todds fiance Stephen Douglas only to disappear entirely when the film dismisses Lincolns entire political career with a soapbox speech and a time-lapse. Theres no sense that Bekmambetov cares about any of the character-building and breast-beating that comes between the sequence where Lincoln chases a vampire by running across the backs of stampeding horses and the one where he battles the vampire leader (Rufus Sewell inevitably the films strongest asset) atop a disintegrating train atop a disintegrating trestle. Problem is even the action sequences dont particularly feel real--particularly in 3-D where the special effects on the vampires eyeballs look distractingly transparent and unfinished. The story is trying to ground fantasy in history but neither one is used coherently enough to connect.

But ""The Dark Knight"" this isnt.Rather than really dive into the fertile terrain about slavery Abe and the Civil War ""Abraham Lincoln"" stays locked and loaded on action most of the time every so often paying lip service to Bigger Issues without ever capitalizing on them.There are three ways to approach material thats as preposterous but stuffed with potential like this 1. Make it campy (which the book didnt). 2. Make it more thoughtful (which this movie avoids). 3. Turn it into a big 3-D action flick (which this movie does).By taking the traditional blockbuster route the results are more of the same as if we really need another stab at a superhero flick when we have ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and ""The Dark Knight Rises"" looming on the horizon.What screenwriter Seth Grahame-Smith who adapted his novel for the screen and director Timur Bekmambetov (""Wanted"") deliver is a revisionist history tale thats unevenly paced and doesnt wholly engage us as it should. Its the second time the collaboration between Grahame-Smith and Tim Burton -- who serves as a co-producer on ""Lincoln"" -- runs into trouble. Earlier this summer the duo teamed up for the dull dud ""Dark Shadows"" -- with Grahame-Smith writing and Burton directing. If only they would have traded the ill-fitting camp in ""Shadows"" for the furrowed-brow action of ""Lincoln"" and vice versa. Advertisement On the whole though ""Vampire Hunter"" is slightly better than ""Shadows"" and occasionally does tap the right vein including an over-the-top action climax on a train a ridiculous stampede where one unsuspecting horse becomes airborne and a rather sweet romance between Abe (Benjamin Walker) and Mary (Mary Elizabeth Winstead a standout). But too often this rather disjointed flick doesnt sink its teeth into the real meat of the story leaping from one fast-edited action sequence to another rather than developing its allegorical underpinnings. That said ""Vampire Hunter"" does have its pleasures especially watching the Great Emancipator played impressively by stage star Walker transform into a one-man vampire-killing machine. His hatred for the fanged fiends begins young after his mother dies and his vengeance gets further fueled by his anger over slavery. Another highlight is witnessing Abe getting trained by vampire buster Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper as dashing as ever). Its truly bizarre.But amid the gorgeous production values and flashily edited carnage -- not nearly as graphic as youd assume -- missed opportunities crop up. The issue of slavery is touched on but like the master bloodsucker Adam (Rufus Sewell) wedged in here doesnt get fully fleshed out.The same applies to Abes childhood friend Will (""The Hurt Lockers"" Anthony Mackie). Hes a strong character and Mackies a very good actor but theres no heavy lifting required.Grahame-Smith should have either expanded on the slavery parallel or just scrapped the high-minded ideals in favor of outright camp. If he had this ""Vampire Hunter"" might have slain us.

""History"" narrates Abe (Benjamin Walker) ""prefers nobility to brutality""-- a fact redressed by Seth Grahame-Smiths screenplay in which the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies author adapts his second cutesy-clever pulp-historical mash-up. Young Mr. Lincoln loses his mother--who actually died from drinking bad milk--to a vampires bite takes up training under hunter Henry Sturgess (Dominic Cooper) and learns to search and destroy Nosferatu with his rail-splitters silver-edged ax finally setting his sights on head vampire Adam (Rufus Sewell) who lives in the ripe antebellum splendor of a Simon Legree. Shot by the estimable Caleb Deschanel and projected in wholly unnecessary 3-D Vampire Hunters bleached palette makes it the ugliest major-studio release this year though it needs be said that Kazakh director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted) approaches the material with a degree of Eurotrash insouciance that is probably necessary to approach it at all and crisply handles set pieces involving a horse stampede and a runaway munitions train. Possible resulting ""fun"" is only slightly mitigated by contemplation of the wearisome decadence of American popular culture.

A skilled rail-splitter axe-wielding Honest Abe moonlights as a slayer of bloodsuckers one of whom at the behest of loathsome slave-trader Jack Barts (Marton Csokas) killed his beloved mother. He still finds time to court Mary Todd campaign against slavery and carve out a political career but faces disaster during the Civil War when the vampires are drafted into service by the Confederate South. The storyline is faithful to neither fiction nor reality. Two new characters have been introduced bored leader of the undead Adam (Rufus Sewell) and Abes (ahem) black best friend from boyhood Will (Anthony Mackie). And two CGI-tastic action scenes have been added a chase through a stampede of horses and a runaway train headed for a burning bridge. Worst of all the inspiring biopic and the bloody 3D spectacle seem to occupy parallel historical time zones.

So on that count it lived up to expectations. However some of the CG effects were quite bad - crowd scenes in particular and the killing of the vampires was extremely bloody and horrible. Also some of the make-up was rubbish - Mary Elizabeth Winstead stands out - which is a shame because the lincoln make-up I thought was really good (apart from the stuck-on beard) Good points - Rufus Sewel who just keeps getting handsomer and handsomer all the time; Dominic Cooper - cute and OTT but in a good way I thought and the guy playing Lincoln was good too.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 23 2012USMAN LATIF KHAWAJAFeaturedanything goes in the name of a summer movie -even this dull boring affair with poor action and woefully benign vampiresFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 23 2012kateFeaturedMy sister and I couldnt stop laughing in this woefully ridiculous film. We are both fans of Seth Grahame-Smiths books and we did expect a fair amount of the ridiculous - but GOOD ridiculous; not this steaming failure of horror. The chase scenes mentioned in the review are worse than you can imagine. Still we definitely got more than a few laughs out of this film so we rate it an extra star than we feel it deserves...Its a pity because the casting of Ben Walker as Honest Abe is very good and he does a pretty great job - just a shame about everything else....FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 21 2012SimonFeaturedI couldnt disagree more with this review much of it bizarrely bemoaning its lack of historical authenticity. This film is called Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter for crying out loud. It wears its irreverent intentions on its sleeves He also implies its somehow unbelievable that someone like Lincoln could have had a black friend. You do know not all Americans back then were rabid racists? Otherwise slavery would never have been abolished. This is a strange sort of inverted political correctness that bashes a film for having a pivotal black character. I thought it was an absolute corker of a film. Its pure escapist entertainment. Horror fans like myself will love the gory blood soaked action. Of course the concept of Lincoln being a vampire hunter alongside being a politician fighting to end slavery is ridiculous but thats the whole point Well get a serious treatment of his life in Spielbergs biopic. This is meant to be just a big fun summer movie and I recommend people make up their own minds. Id advise not to see it in 3D though as it doesnt really add anything to the experience. If you dont get the reference to Lincolns visit to the theatre shame on you The audience I saw it with clearly didnt know their history.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 21 2012SimonFeaturedI couldnt disagree more with this review much of it bizarrely bemoaning its lack of historical authenticity.
