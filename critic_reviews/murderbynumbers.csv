Low-key by contempo thriller standards this stylish foray into Hitchcock territory by eclectic director Barbet Schroeder is marked by strong performances. The Leopold and Loeb story gets a modernistic makeover in ""Murder by Numbers"" an engrossing but psychologically shallow tale of a female cop on the tail of two arrogant teenage killers. Low-key by contempo thriller standards this stylish foray into Hitchcock territory by eclectic director Barbet Schroeder is marked by strong performances from its leading players not the least of them from Sandra Bullock as a maverick investigator with her own set of issues. Those misled into expecting ""Seven""-ish sensationalism by the title and intriguing campaign will be disappointed and B.O. prospects look midrange. Opening scene of the disturbingly acute Justin (Michael Pitt) delivering a Nietzschean-flavored talk on the nature of good and evil and freedom and submission to his high school class instantly raises hopes that a genre picture with an unusually refined sensibility may be in store. And the way that Justin and his rich pretty boy friend Richard (Ryan Gosling) sit around conspiring while drinking absinthe leaves little doubt that they are the culprits behind a grisly strangulation of a young woman now being assessed by homicide detective Cassie Mayweather (Bullock) and her green new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Like their famous youthful predecessors from 1920s Chicago whose exploits inspired Hitchcocks ""Rope"" ""Compulsion"" and the indie ""Swoon"" among other dramas Justin and Richard consider themselves so smart and superior as to be beyond apprehension; killing for them is a game that will simply prove their cleverness. Justin is the brainy philosophical one who has no trouble putting himself on a plane above everyone else while Richard doesnt even have to think to know that hes got advantages every other young man envies -- looks money instant appeal to girls and a connected father who can bail him out of any jam. But as strong and charismatic as Pitt and Gosling are playing these upper-class California devils they are let down by the screenplay by Tony Gayton (""The Salton Sea"") which doesnt explore the nature of their dubious collaboration deeply or convincingly. The obvious latent homoerotic nature of the relationship is superficially present but not in a way that is at all meaningful or interesting. While confident mentally the mop-haired somewhat awkward Justin is insecure with girls even when ultra-cute fellow student Lisa (Agnes Bruckner fine here as in the Sundance hit ""Blue Car"") opens the door wide for him. By contrast Richard seems almost bored by how easy it is for him to score but aside from the kicks involved its difficult to see how he connects with Justin who of course is envious of his partners savoir-faire. Script sorely lacks some glue -- intellectual emotional political -- that would bond the boys in their mutual fascination and deadly pursuits an even partial male equivalent of what Peter Jackson supplied so successfully in ""Heavenly Creatures."" Fortunately there is some welcome psychological layering on the other side of the narrative. While attractive and stylish Cassie is a major misfit and loner. Professionally confident and not afraid to tell people what she thinks of them she behaves a lot like a guy She likes solitary drinking on her houseboat keeps whatever shes feeling thoroughly under wraps and is not into emotional commitments initiating sex when where and with whom she wants it. She also has a few secrets in her past and theyre deep painful ones that have decisively influenced her choice of profession and how she lives. The gradual revelation of these secrets is interesting enough but the great pleasure of the character and of Bullocks shrewdly understated performance is that Cassie is not tortured obsessed or undone by her past traumas; she has dealt with them has long since learned how to negotiate around their detritus and has transformed the negatives into strengths at least in portions of her life. To be sure she is neurotically controlling willing to let men get into her body but not under her skin but the trait is of a piece with her adamantly independent spirit and tough-minded outlook on life. Its not surprising then that Cassie early on makes a quick conquest of the malleable Sam no matter how questionable the hookup is from a professional p.o.v.; hes like a deer caught in the headlights and will clearly never be able to stand up to her. Sam is even more of a pushover than was Chaplins milquetoasty clerk opposite Nicole Kidman in ""Birthday Girl"" which the actor might bear in mind when considering future roles. In that the killers m.o. involves the careful planting of clues such as threads and hairs to lead the cops to a different perpetrator there are conventional audience-pleasing satisfactions to be had from following Cassies gradual progress in cracking the case and from her intermittent confrontations with the boys even before she has the goods on them. Also pleasing is the filmmakers refusal to follow the annoying example of so many other similar stories by setting up the most sympathetic and vulnerable secondary character -- in this case Lisa -- as the obvious next victim. But there are no outright gasps or thrills and the tension level never rises very high. Handsomely lensed by Luciano Tovoli pic uses San Luis Obispo locations to excellent advantage in evoking an affluent world of privilege that presumably helps free the teens of moral burdens. A dilapidated house on an oceanside bluff in which the boys sometimes meet is rather overwrought and phony looking but no more so than the key settings in numerous Hitchcock films. Subtle and unusual score by Clint Mansell formerly of the band Pop Will Eat Itself is a real plus.

Feeney Queen of Hearts Queen of Spades Wednesday April 17 2002 at 12 a.m. By F. X. Feeney WERE SPEEDING IN A HORSE-DRAWN COACH keeping abreast of the sun as it sparkles through a high canopy of trees privy to the exertions of a pair of noblewomen who are busily disguising themselves as men. The dialogue is from the 18th century but the film grammar -- quick cuts high-energy camera work crisp sound design -- is pure 21st. A clever princess (Mira Sorvino) on the verge of becoming queen has set out to put things right before ascending to the throne Her father a wise and just king was nonetheless a usurper. The rightful heir to the crown is young Agis (Jay Rodan) sheltered since childhood in the remote countryside by his scheming uncle radical philosopher Hermocrates (Sir Ben Kingsley) and his spinster aunt madcap amateur scientist Leontine (Fiona Shaw). This high-minded pair have instructed the would-be king to despise all women to say nothing of love in general and to hate the princess in particular. (Agis uses an effigy painted in her likeness for archery practice.) Disguised as a man the princess -- who a short time ago fell wildly in love with this castaway monarch when she spied him skinny-dipping in the forest -- means to befriend him to test whether their hearts despite her masquerade and despite the treacheries of the past can triumph over all. If later they can find it in themselves to fall in love she reasons then peace will reign and theyll both be free of the warring roles into which they were born. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - It says everything about the lucid intelligence of Clare Peploes direction that shes able to distill such a complicated setup into the bright brevity of the films first few scenes. It also helps that the text is that of the 18th-century French farce The Triumph of Love. Pierre Carlet de Chamblain de Marivaux was a master of narrative concentration able to compress a wealth of back story into a few pithy exchanges then move characters through obstacle courses of deceit and surrender whose breakneck pacing plainly left its mark on Hollywoods screwball era. His one-liners are elegant (""Spare your intelligence the mistake of insulting my own"") and dazzlingly top one another. Yet Peploe -- who has directed such films as Rough Magic in 1994 with Russell Crowe and Bridget Fonda and collaborated in various capacities with husband Bernardo Bertolucci on most of his films since the 1970s -- yields pleasures throughout that are more cinematic than theatrical. Her lively lawless cutting -- sharp ellipses that occur even in the middle of a shot eliminating any breath-space of dead air -- acts as a vital unpredictable counterpoint to the antique formal postures struck by the characters re-introducing the same delightfully anarchic spirit that also informs the acting. Kingsley and Shaw are (as might be expected) pitch-perfect anyway whether storming about the spectacular Tuscan villa where the story is set or toppling from the high towers of erotic and romantic resistance theyve taken lifetimes to build up inside themselves. The princess -- slipping in and out of her gender masquerade as the need arises posing as a man to woo Leontine and then confessing her womanhood to the eagle-eyed Hermocrates the better to flatter his intellect -- emotionally seduces each in turn. (Rachael Stirling Ignazio Oliva and Luis Molteni knock about underfoot as the instantly likable crew of loyal and/or bribable clowns the princess enlists in her campaign.) What is surprising and what one takes away most deeply and happily from Triumph of Love is a refreshed admiration for Mira Sorvino. While she has always had a magnetic presence and a sure-footed comedic sense (that Oscar for Mighty Aphrodite was no accident) she has often seemed held back by a studied self-conscious physical stiffness that filmmakers (particularly in the action scenes of Mimic and The Replacement Killers) so often appeared to be cutting around. Here she is so agile in her transformations from female to male and back again adopting a comically expert male walk in a merry eye-blink as she hurries from one seduction to the next that she smoothly amplifies the larger transformations that are the comedys true theme. She seems like one of Marivauxs witticisms made flesh. Sandra cocked and loaded MIRA SORVINOS 18th-CENTURY FRENCH PRINCESS and Sandra Bullocks 21st-century detective in Murder by Numbers would seem on the surface to have very little in common. Both of course are women. Both are trying against very steep odds to see justice done and both films -- however clever and schematically plotted their story structures -- are at bottom preoccupied with the mystery at the center of these womens hearts. But where Sorvinos princess unabashedly believes in love Bullocks homicide detective despises it with a rare fervor. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Why is a question director Barbet Schroeder and writer Tony Gayton shrewdly leave hanging for a good while. At first Murder by Numbers works up a spooky compelling murder story. From the first were made aware that two ""exceptional"" high school students (The Believers Ryan Gosling and Hedwig and the Angry Inchs Michael Pitt) precocious nihilists modeled on the 1920s thrill killers Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb have chosen a stranger at random and put her to death. When the police follow the standard clues -- hairs fibers boot prints estimated time of death -- they find themselves going in circles. Cassie (short one would hope for Cassandra) the chief investigator argues that this blind trail fits no ordinary murder profile because the killer or killers seem to have read up on the conventional psychologies and to be deliberately taunting their pursuers with false clues. Her superiors (who call Cassie ""The Hyena"" behind her back a reference to the female of that species false penis) think her theory is far-fetched and throw obstacles in her way when her hunches lead her to stalking the pampered sons of some high-powered locals. So far so traditional. Then the movie takes a welcome detour as Cassie breaks in her straight-laced new partner (Ben Chaplin) pulling him into bed with her at the end of their first day on the job together. This is such a surprising and pleasing departure from the puritanism that has afflicted relations between men and women in so many recent Hollywood movies you might half-ask yourself ""Is this a foreign film?"" And the answer would be yes sort of. The Tehran-born cosmopolitan globetrotting Schroeder (from Uganda in the documentary Idi Amin Dada to downtown Los Angeles in Charles Bukowskis Barfly to Brazil in last years Our Lady of the Assassins) is a natural to protect this most adventurous and vital dimension of Gaytons script. In the same breath that it turns the difficult partnership between Bullock and Chaplin into something like a relationship the viewer might actually remember from his or her own life it advances the most interesting dimension of the film -- the riddle of this womans personality -- with a force that feels effortless. Were less in suspense over how (or if) the killers will be caught than we are over the question of just who this tough hedonistic detective is. Unfortunately as the preoccupation with catching the bad guys becomes more pronounced this more fascinating potential is relegated to the back seat. Even as the psychological interdependencies of the two boys take the foreground the movie gets more and more crowded with fun-house surprises and cliffhanging set pieces when what might have served the story better is a moment in which the detective sees herself in either or both of the boys even though she has to take them down. It says much in favor of Gayton and Schroeders craft that these repugnant cold-blooded young heavies do achieve a measure of poignancy -- one gets the sense that neither had much of a chance against the demons driving him -- yet that spark of insight never really jumps from them to the movies heroine and through her to us.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Cassie (Sandra Bullock) and her partner (Ben Chaplin) investigate a crime scene in the thriller ""Murder by Numbers."" Bullocks dark journey / Characters carry murder mystery 1 / 1 Back to Gallery MURDER BY NUMBERS Suspense thriller. Starring Sandra Bullock Ryan Gosling Michael Pitt and Ben Chaplin. Directed by Barbet Schroeder. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Murder by Numbers"" is a near miss a respectable but uninspired thriller thats intelligent and considered in its details but ultimately weak in its impact. Its main virtue is that it presents off-center characters and lets them collide in a series of strong two-person scenes. Yet a built-in lack of suspense keeps the film from fully taking flight. The germ of the story derives from the 1920s case of Leopold and Loeb the pair of honor students who in a psychotic intellectual exercise tried to commit the perfect murder. In ""Murder by Numbers"" we have two modern high school kids who murder a random woman in a philosophical quest to become supermen. This brings on an investigation headed by a detective named Cassie who is just emotionally screwed up enough to have insight into the criminal mind. ""Murder by Numbers"" is really a character study of the detective played by Sandra Bullock. Haunted by some trauma Cassie pours everything into her work and spends her free time sitting in her houseboat watching TV and getting drunk. Bullock who could have spent the past 10 years just twinkling and acting cute keeps gravitating toward roles in which she can look grungy and show the dark side of her tomboy kid-sister personality. In one of the movies best scenes if only because its odd and atypical Cassie seduces her new partner (Ben Chaplin) and the result is one of the most unerotic sex scenes imaginable. Its nothing like the nirvana interlude we see in every other movie in which the line between the actress and the character blends and the audience watches in vicarious fascination. This is just grim and lonely a tribute to the honesty of Bullock and director Barbet Schroeder. ""Murder by Numbers"" goes further than ""28 Days"" and ""Miss Congeniality"" in injecting harshness into Bullocks screen image. If nothing else its interesting to see how her jokey cheerful demeanor can add a note of eeriness and complexity to scenes in which Cassie behaves strangely. Theres a scene in which her partner refuses to be seduced by her a second time and she teases him ""What? You want a ring? You want promises?"" In that moment its as if were seeing the remnants of Cassies personality the one she had before the bad things happened to her. The picture has the structure of an old ""Columbo"" episode. We know who did it if not exactly how and the rest is the story of how the detective goes about proving it. In the case of ""Murder by Numbers"" Cassies intuition is so profound that its as if she had read the screenplay in advance. In the course of the investigation she interviews the young murderers Justin (Michael Pitt) and Richard (Ryan Gosling) and develops an immediate loathing for Richard a rich kid who oozes confidence and self-satisfaction. Like Hitchcocks ""Rope"" (also based on the Leopold and Loeb case) the picture finds time to touch on the sadism and power shifts in the boys relationship. Both young actors are excellent Pitt in his skewed sensitive big-lipped way and Gosling in an oily way that will make viewers want to smack the smirk off his face. Goslings poise is uncanny in someone so young and he holds the screen well in his encounters with Bullock. The movie also gets mileage out of the murder itself -- the planning of the details is intriguing at least clinically. Where the movie sags is in its overall conception. By setting itself up as a character study the movie promises a payoff it cant deliver. It tries to tell us that somehow through the investigation the detective can finally get over her past but we dont believe it and neither do the filmmakers. The result is that although we walk out having seen many strong individual scenes we have the flat feeling of having seen nothing much. This film contains strong language violence and sexual situations.

"CNN.com - Review Dull Murder by the numbers - April 19 2002 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 Review Dull Murder by the numbers New Bullock movie like many others By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Why are Sandra Bullocks movies so dependably generic? Although ""Murder by Numbers"" isnt a jumble you can barely remember you saw it 10 minutes after its over. Inspired by the legendary murder case of Leopold and Loeb the movie follows the snooty escapades of two high school kids who kill a stranger simply to see if they can mislead the cops into thinking someone else did it. Bullock plays Cassie Mayweather an iron-pants police investigator whos rather disliked by her male colleagues. Cassie you see cant be pushed around and shes famous for manipulating her partners with a barrage of obsessive police work and come-hither sexuality. We dont witness the actual killing until very near the end of the film at which point its lingered over like a hearty merlot. The movie does start at the crime scene a riverbank where Bullocks character makes her entrance with her new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). A woman has been found strangled stabbed and wrapped in plastic ... but you knew that already if youve ever seen one of these movies. Cassie shows Sam the ropes by gingerly stepping around the place and gathering miniscule clues. Director Barbet Schroeder -- who as much as anyone involved is responsible for the pictures guiding sense of been-there-done-that -- delivers one inventive shot The camera slowly zooms in on the corpse until we see a full-screen close-up of a telltale piece of thread. Odd couples That thread was purposefully put there by Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt) high school buddies who have an ill-defined homoerotic attachment to one another. They also know a hell of a lot about forensic science. Justin is a moody genius with greasy hair who can barely make eye contact with his classmates; his essay about the nature of crime murder and social freedom plants the seed that leads to the killing. Richard unlike his buddy is a filthy-rich charmer who masks his sociopathic tendencies by flirting with and usually seducing anyone who gets near him. This will eventually include Justins girlfriend (Agnes Bruckner). Just to make sure Justin knows about it Richard secretly videotapes the lovemaking session.

"USATODAY.com - Standout performances lift Murder by Numbers Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/20/2002 - Updated 1013 AM ET Standout performances lift Murder by NumbersBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Sandra Bullock stars in Murder By Numbers. A naggingly watchable mystery whose killers and pursuing cop could all use psychiatric help Murder by Numbers boasts Sandra Bullocks best performance since the promising early days of Wrestling Ernest Hemingway and Speed. Yet this plot-heavy and occasionally wobbly psychological drama is stolen by two standout supporting players.Relative newcomers Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling finesse their modern-day variations on Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold the upper-crust 1920s ""thrill killers"" who inspired Alfred Hitchcocks Rope and screen biopics. Pitt who was the object of a lounge singers fantasies in Hedwig and the Angry Inch is the brainy but socially insecure half of the murder team; Gosling (a small role in Remember the Titans) is the more cocksure member and a high school star. Bored the rich kids meticulously plan and carry out the fatal abduction of a stranger -- for sport. Murder by Numbers (out of four)Stars Sandra Bullock Ben Chaplin Ryan Gosling Michael Pitt Agnes Bruckner Chris Penn Rating R for violence language a sex scene and brief drug useView the trailer Bullocks detective soon suspects their well-crafted coverup and is not amused -- by the crime by Goslings smugness or by department higher-ups happy to pin the crime on a local loser the boys have framed. She seethes inside from a life of class resentment and much much worse (an ugly incident revealed belatedly). With an infectious smile that helps compensate for an overly mild screen persona Ben Chaplin plays Bullocks relatively diffident new partner assigned to work with her because no one else will. Ben Chaplin and Sandra Bullock in the suspense-thriller Murder By Numbers. The movie is more upfront about Bullocks hang-ups than the boys sexuality. The pair flirt with each other despite their rival interest in a teen-dream classmate (Agnes Bruckner more fine casting on director Barbet Schroeders part). When Bullocks hardened pro almost immediately hops into bed with new partner Chaplin Murder seems to be taking an arbitrarily romantic turn. Later its explained (fairly convincingly) that seducing-and-discarding is part of her characters long-established sexual game plan.After an uncertain start Murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with Bullocks memorable first interrogation of Gosling. Fairly restrained given its grisly subject it surprises by climaxing with some of the most flamboyantly stylized melodrama since David Strathairn met his maker in 1995s Dolores Claiborne. At its weakest neither Schroeder nor writer Tony Gayton quite manage to unify what sometimes feels like two or three different movies. But when they do the result is two or three cuts above genre standard.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Murder by Numbers Suzanne Hanover) C+ Murder by Numbers Genre Mystery and Thriller Comedy; Starring Sandra Bullock Ben Chaplin Ryan Gosling Chris Penn Michael Pitt; Director Barbet Schroeder; Author Henry Bean Tony Gayton; Release Date Wide 04/19/2002; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 17 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT I count two movies in Murder by Numbers the newest Sandra Bullock vehicle in which the star appears to be tough and tomboyish but reveals herself to be soft and all-girl when the right guy gets past her pjs. First of course what weve got here is a standard Sandra Bullock vehicle The dark-eyed sport plays a homicide detective who demonstrates shes one of the guys the same way she did in ""Miss Congeniality"" - i.e. by eating and drinking with a gusto just this side of barnyard. As Cassie Mayweather Bullock is a California cop whos allergic to romance but who has no trouble seducing a man and then kicking him out of bed when shes ready for serious sleep. Cassies newest working partner (and bedmate) the smart and presentable Sam (Ben Chaplin) finds this out early on leading us not at all subtly to suspect that something as yet unrevealed in Cassies personal history makes her shut down and fill up with liquor. Unfortunately what we also realize is that theres going to be no way to avoid finding out what that secret sorrow is in the last act - however little we care - since we know even before the lights go down that a Sandra Bullock heroine not only will survive but will also clean up nicely and Feel the Love. But ""Murder by Numbers"" is also a dirtier darker crime thriller about a couple of cocky high school seniors who pride themselves on their ability to commit the perfect murder - a compulsion that continues to inspire movie plots long after the notorious real-life 1924 case of the calculating college-age killers Leopold and Loeb. Brilliant outcast Justin (Michael Pitt the baby-faced beauty who broke a transsexuals heart in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") bonds with popular nihilistic Richard (""The Believer""s Ryan Gosling a phenomenal talent even in junk like this) founding a club of two on the boredom and neglect of affluent adolescence. And they might just get away with their scheme - Chris Penn plays the hapless school janitor ensnared in their booby trap of misleading clues - were Cassie not so particularly on guard for reasons of her own against the lies of privileged young men. ""Do you get away with this s-- because you look like that?"" she asks a smirking Richard speaking the pointed sour dialogue of Tony Gaytons screenplay. The relationship between the twisted killers in ""Murder by Numbers"" is far more interesting than that of the collaborative cops not only to us but also to director Barbet Schroeder - a fancier of the underbelly in ""Reversal of Fortune"" ""Barfly"" and ""Single White Female"" and a guy who really couldnt give a fig what Sandra Bullock does in her pjs. With the deceptively warm light of master cinematographer Luciano Tovoli (""The Passenger"") beaming down on them Pitt and Gosling clash and embrace in such psychosexually charged performances that even though Bullock engages in a climactic scene of blue-screen peril she essentially cedes the match to the kids. In this mediocre murder case their presence is the only thing thats really killer.
