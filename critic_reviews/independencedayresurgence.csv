Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Independence Day"" was an ultra-savvy adventure that combined elements of sci-fi and war saga into a genre flick with breathtaking originality. Its Earth vs. aliens epic was the highest-grossing American movie of 1996 an enjoyable superhit. Despite its similar pacing action and extraterrestrial hordes returning for a rematch ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is a dull brainless sequel representing how sadly major studio film quality has declined in the intervening two decades. And how gullible the makers think audiences have become. Publicists kept it from being viewed by critics before the opening day and now we know why. The scariest aspect of the film is the exposition which feels like six confusing movies in one. It is set 20 years after the interplanetary war of the first film. Humanity now uses alien technology to beef up its defenses and is united to vanquish further invasions. Of course the attackers have had just as long to re-equip and many survivors of the first conflict have developed migraine headaches involving visions of the swarms return so morale is not too high in certain quarters. You might think that the themes of multiple populations wanting government protection against outside invaders would plug into the social mood of the times but here they fizzle like wet July 4th firecrackers. The extravagant special effects that made the old film a surprising delight have been repeated to exhaustion. Wringing computer-generated visuals for the maximum number of UFOs that can be crammed on the screen adds nothing. 20th Century Fox Jeff Goldblum is back as scientist David Levinson. While director Roland Emmerichs image of a spacecraft vaporizing the White House set a new disaster movie peak cliched images of landmarks being destroyed are dull as dishwater now. Here we see an alien ship suck up Shanghai and spit it on London without much effect on our adrenaline. If you have been watching the first ""Independence Day"" to prepare for the second quit while youre ahead. It pulls in much of the first films cast but pays scant attention to their characters. A busload of young and international players are added in a naked effort to boost the audience appeal in as many quadrants as possible. They are superfluous strangers brought on board to grimace through repetitive full-face closeups while things explode. Liam Hemsworth has been recruited to imitate the cocky fighter pilot humor that Will Smith provided by bucketloads in the original. His wannabe Han Solo swagger is as flat as the scripts uninspired one-liners. The attempted callbacks to the originals joke about fighting an alien with an uppercut or growling ""Get ready for a close encounter"" miss the mark by light-years. Seeing Smith smoke a cigar after tromping the aliens was a lot more entertaining than watching Hemsworth take a leak on their battleship and flip them the bird. Its easy to see why this joyless reunion convinced Smith not to reprise the role that made him a young global star. There are repetitive tries to launch romantic connections between scientists (with quirky Jeff Goldblum and Charlotte Gainsbourg winking a bit at that absurdity) an engaged couple (Hemsworth and Maika Monroe playing the daughter of former President Bill Pullman who is now a pill-swallowing ""crazy old man"") young fighter pilots (Hong Kong pop star Angelababy playing a cute combat ace and American colleague Travis Tope) and the films token gay couple (Brent Spiner and John Storey two stars returning from the first film). Each bland pairing has the chemical excitement of stale peanut butter. In place of the kind of human drama that elevates Marvel franchise movies we have squads of people trying to put out a fire with high-tech buckets. There are unnecessary subplots involving boozy merchant seamen kids driving aimlessly in search of their lost parents (complete with a little pet dog who must be saved from the almighty alien queen) and international leaders with very bad instincts about defending the planet. When a 3000-mile-wide doomsday spaceship jolts them by its arrival one utters ""How did we miss that?"" Its the sort of remark you expect from a producer who has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into an apocalypse movie that is a genuine disaster. It is difficult to overstate how bad it is. Did they not see that coming?

Coming two decades after its mildly enjoyable predecessor -- a movie probably best consumed in bits and pieces on cable which likely explains its endurance -- the sequel does manage to reunite much of the original cast with the notable exception of Will Smith. The latest alien invasion doesnt just draw heavily from the earlier film but from a whole treasure trove of movie cliches. Those range from the ""Top Gun""-like feud between the heroes to a ""Close Encounters""-like foreshadowing of whats to come with survivors sketching out visions that are later brought vividly to life. The only real innovation in the story -- conjured up by director Roland Emmerich his producing partner Dean Devlin and a trio of collaborators -- is that the last attack created a sort of global utopia. Faced with annihilation the world came together and is still benefiting from having adopted the gee-whiz technology the invaders left behind. Related Finding Dory feels less buoyant than Nemo After that though its all pretty much business as usual with the son of Smiths character Dylan (""Survivors Remorse"" star Jesse T. Usher) now a top pilot harboring a grudge against Jake (Liam Hemsworth) another flying ace with whom hell inevitably be thrown together to help save the world. Meanwhile scientist David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is now in an unexpected position of authority and the former president (Bill Pullman) drops his cane and rejoins the fight. (Sela Ward incidentally plays the current president and shes no shrinking violet when it comes to interstellar foreign policy.) Emmerich has talked in interviews about the improvement in special effects since the first go-round but that simply ensures that the showdown will be more protracted chaotic and loud. Related X-Men Apocalypse doesnt take off Moreover the movie keeps announcing over and over exactly how much time is left before the world gets destroyed. In practical terms that simply reminds the audience that this two-hour exercise feels like a pretty long sit despite its frenetic pacing. Fox which is releasing the movie waited to screen the film until opening day which suggests that the studio realized critics probably wouldnt be its co-pilot on this one. Nevertheless in what can be seen either as optimism or hubris ""Independence Day Resurgence"" works in a rather obvious set-up for a sequel before its all over.

By Anthony Lane The aliens return in Roland Emmerichs sequel to his 1996 movie.   Credit Illustration by Paul Hoppe Twenty years ago in ""Independence Day"" an alien attack was repelled by David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) a scientist so brilliant that he even knew how to send a virus from his laptop. Assistance was provided by his grumpy father (Judd Hirsch) a Marine Corps pilot (Will Smith) and Tom Whitmore (Bill Pullman) who was the leader of the free world and of the airborne defense. So noble was their effort apparently that it ushered in two decades of universal peace armed conflict among nations has subsided and the world in line with John Lennons instructions has lived as one. Needless to say this dreary state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist and the bracing news brought by the sequel ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is that the aliens have returned to harvest Earths molten core. Who will stop them this time around? Whitmore is now a shaggy ruin with a walking stick and a supply of meds; the current President (Sela Ward) seems decisive but the film confines her to the fringes of the action. Meanwhile Smiths character has died either because Smiths agent considered the financial package insufficiently galactic or more likely because Smith read the script. The pilots son Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) is now in the hot seat though sadly he lacks the firepower of his fathers personality. Rivalry flares between Hiller and Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) a fellow sky jockey but it peters out after a single punch in the canteen. In short its up to Goldblum to save the film. (The world by comparison is easily saved. It always is.) I will watch him in anything; that stop-start delivery all ums and hums combines with his smile--so winning yet so quick to die--and his buggy eyes to suggest a soul both hyper and hazed-over. You never know quite how he will respond to any predicament nor you sometimes feel does he. The main reason for the success of ""Independence Day"" was the mashing together of Goldblum and Smith. They were a genuine odd couple--the wonkish ruminant sharing a cockpit with Mr. Congeniality whose days flew by without a flutter of self-doubt. No surprise then that Goldblum seems a little lonely and marooned in the latest venture which suffers from a nagging case of Smithlessness. Theres nothing here to compare with the eruption of joy back in 1996 when our heroes hurtled free of the enemy stronghold by the merest squeak eliciting from Smith the triumphal roar ""Elvis has left the building."" The director now as then is Roland Emmerich who like a constant lover refuses to tame his devotion; and what he loves is enormity. The incoming mother ship this time is round and flat and three thousand miles in diameter as if the aliens deepest ambition were not to exterminate us but to make paella for everyone on the planet. And if you dig the ship check out the mother--the queen of the meanies who rolls up late in the show gambolling across salt flats toward a school bus full of innocent children. In a way Emmerich is more fearless than any of his characters boldly embracing cliches from which other directors would shrink and flee and unabashed by his old-school craving to astound. Witness the gravitational field exerted by the ship which can suck buses cars and bridges out of a city and whoosh them upward. As a spectacle that is outdone only by the spooky sight of Judd Hirsch who hasnt aged a minute since the last film. The first ""Independence Day"" had the gratifying slap of good pop cinema harmless and weightless; the follow-up is twice as big and half as fun. Even the special effects begin to pale and some of them in the closing scenes feel sketchy and unfinished. Either Fox ran out of time or cash or Emmerich taking his cue from Schubert simply threw up his hands and said ""Screw it. Thatll have to do."" In truth the film doesnt really end let alone draw to a cathartic conclusion; it just stops. If you must see it then at least try to do so as I did in IMAX and 3-D. This is known as immersive moviegoing and what it means in practice is that rather than watching London being destroyed before your very eyes you are left with the distinct impression that London is being destroyed midway between your eyeballs. Everything quakes. For the price of a single ticket I got to experience a two-hour sci-fi extravaganza and had my sinuses drained at the same time. You cant argue with value like that. No one but John le Carre would write a novel called ""Our Kind of Traitor."" That unstable compound of clubbability and deceit belongs to him alone. The book which appeared in 2010 has now become a film directed by Susanna White. Its hero is Perry Makepeace (Ewan McGregor) who would rather not be a hero at all. He is married to Gail (Naomie Harris) a lawyer; he teaches English literature at a university in London; and his surname betrays a constitutional wish to stay out of trouble. But trouble comes to find him anyway. It takes the portly shape of Dima (Stellan Skarsgard) an effusive Russian thug. (His naked body glimpsed at a sports club is so richly inked with tattoos that its more like a treasure map than like a living form.) Dima works for the Mafia of his motherland and his job is to launder money as efficiently and no doubt as regularly as the rest of us wash our shirts. He has fallen foul of his employers however who will soon exact vengeance and his plan is to trade his wicked secrets--some involving British politicians--for a new life plus a new identity in England. But how can he communicate with the spymasters of London and not alert his predators who presumably track his electronic spoor? If Dima asked me I would say ""Write a letter and pop it in the mail"" but I guess that might abbreviate the plot. Instead he befriends Perry who is on vacation at the same hotel in Marrakesh. The Englishman wary of being impolite accepts a glass of Chateau Petrus not a wine that you should ever spurn and an invitation to a night of Bacchic misrule. Thus wooed he agrees to transport a memory stick on Dimas behalf only to find himself wading up to his chin in the slime of the intelligence game. The novel was adapted by Hossein Amini who clearly enjoys the challenge of tough texts. If you have conjured screenplays as he has from Thomas Hardy Henry James Elmore Leonard and Patricia Highsmith then le Carre is no cause for alarm and some of Aminis alterations are well wrought. Where Perry and Gail in the book are on their trip because she has inherited a slab of money the movie tells us--with a shot of her lying sadly in bed reluctant to make love--that they are trying to repair a dented relationship. That suits the mood of sorrow (le Carre long ago persuaded us that a country can fray and fail as easily as a marriage) and it also suggests why Perry might accede to Dimas plea--not out of moral probity or patriotic duty but simply for the thrill. How better to rouse your sex life than by turning into a spy? And yet there is a blank space in this film where plausibility should dwell. Since the end of the Cold War le Carre has increasingly drawn his players not from the corridors or smoky pubs of power but from the amateur ranks--the tyros and the patsies who are leaned upon to answer powers bidding. That is as true of Perry as it is of Jonathan Pine in ""The Night Manager"" (recently dramatized and shown on AMC) although in the case of the bookish Perry you are tempted to ask Does the fun of the film--a shoot-out in a forest a midair explosion and so on--take place for real or could it all be unfolding inside his brain? Maybe he did nothing more than sprawl on a Moroccan beach with a copy of Graham Greene glance at Russian tourists and feed them into his daydream of a plot. A hint of that reverie hangs over the movie thanks to the cinematography of Anthony Dod Mantle. He often works with Lars von Trier and Danny Boyle and the images in ""Our Kind of Traitor"" feel woozy and submarine--hardly what we associate with this most clinical of genres. Indeed the whole film is oddly poised between the pensive and the peevish with a topdressing of high jinks. We get a cameo from le Carre himself as we did in ""The Night Manager"" and a good sly performance from Damian Lewis as Hector Perrys contact in London. (Hectors thick-rimmed glasses pay homage to Harry Palmer the agent played by Michael Caine in the nineteen-sixties.) Slowly though it is Skarsgard who takes charge positioning Dima--ruthless jovial and doomed--at the heart of this saturnine tale. Only in one respect is Dima a naif. Preserving faith in what he calls ""your famous fucking British fair play"" he even describes Perry as ""a gentleman."" In the world of le Carre that is like seeing a unicorn.

"Independence Day Resurgence | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; independence-day-resurgence ) Independence Day Resurgence (United States 2016) June 25 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli The temptation is there to say that Independence Day Resurgence tarnishes the image of its predecessor but the original Independence Day wasnt all that good to begin with. Its probably better in our memories than it ever was on celluloid and as a result the sequel looks considerably worse by comparison. In fact when it comes to dredging up old Devlin/Emmerich memories Resurgence recalls nothing more strongly than the colossal 1998 misfire of Godzilla. Its shameless pilfering from science fiction classics (a little Star Wars a little Aliens...) doesnt appreciably elevate the material. This is a clear example of a story being thrown together to serve the special effects not the other way around. And whenever you start out trying to please a non-English speaking audience first you end up with something on the Transformers end of the sci-fi spectrum. 20 years is an eternity to wait for a sequel and by now its a good bet that a significant portion of the audience doesnt care. 16-year old boys have turned into 36-year old men with other concerns. Independence Day may have caught lightning in a bottle; its doubtful the sequel will be as lucky. More likely the studio will be left thunderstruck by how poorly it performs. A better story might have made some difference but the real killing blow may be the absence of Will Smith. Then again considering his (rejected) salary demands for reprising his role maybe 20th Century Fox showed some semblance of fiscal sanity in this regard. Returning cast members include Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson a scientist who now acts and sounds exactly like Ian Malcolm his Jurassic Park alter-ego; Bill Pullman as ex-President Whitmore who still likes giving rousing speeches; Judd Hirsch as Davids grumpy father whose character is even more annoying this time around; and a couple of other minor players (Brent Spiner Vivica A. Fox). Maika Monroe plays Patricia Whitmore the presidents grown-up daughter and Jessie T. Usher is Dylan Hiller the son of Will Smiths dead character. The putative ""lead"" is Liam Hemsworths Jake Morrison a hotshot pilot who starts out the movie based on the moon. Sela Ward is the new president and William Fichtner is the hawkish General Adams. (Robert Loggia has a cameo. Its impossible to determine however whether this was filmed before Loggia died or whether its the result of CGI manipulation. Either is possible considering the blink-and-youll-miss-it nature of his appearance.) Independence Day Resurgence transpires on the 20th anniversary of the ""War of 1996"" as its being called. Whitmore a bearded hobbled recluse (shades of Donald Pleasance in Halloween 6) is sounding the warning cry that the aliens are coming - something the moon crew including Jake finds out first-hand. David investigating the only intact alien ship from the first invasion heads for the moon as soon as he learns that something interesting has been shot down. From that point its an alien-invasion-by-the-numbers approach in the Emmerich/Devlin/Bruckheimer/Bay style with lots of pyrotechnics massive destruction and far too many pointless secondary characters. Independence Day Resurgence is supposed to be light summer entertainment an opportunity to sit back and not have to think too much. Actually thinking of any kind will ruin the experience because this movie is too stupid to survive even a moments consideration. Its too predictable and pointless to be more than sporadically enjoyable and those moments are few and far between. With the exception of David (who as I mentioned above seems more like Goldblums Jurassic Park character than the original incarnation) everyone from the first film is treated rather shabbily. The objective of Independence Day Resurgence is to get the next generation off the ground and it doesnt go well. During one of the endless interminable dogfights I started rooting for the aliens. Thats not a good sign. The attack on the mother ship is intended to pay homage to the Death Star run in Star Wars. Unfortunately it doesnt even achieve the level of Anakins whoopee attack on the droid control ship in The Phantom Menace. As for the queen alien - H.R. Gigers estate should sue (I looked for his name in the end credits but didnt see it). Although reminiscent of the aliens look from the original Independence Day (which was in and of itself highly derivative of Alien) this one borrows so heavily from the queen mother in Aliens that I kept waiting for someone to shout ""Get away from her you bitch"" Didnt happen. I guess Emmerich doesnt recognize that with a film this cheesy that sort of thing will buy a little goodwill. Emmerich has made public statements that he has plans to make a third Independence Day movie. Unless the film scores huge overseas numbers dont expect that to come to fruition. However while we may be spared the final chapter of a trilogy the filmmakers unwillingness to let his alien invasion lie buried in the 1990s has allowed him to join in the orgy of excessive spectacle that is todays blockbuster - American movies made for non-English speaking audiences where the universal language is violence explosions and global carnage.

For all its silliness the movie has endured because it contains real menace an impressive cast of charismatic stars and a story with a clear beginning middle and end. By contrast its sequel Independence Day Resurgence which comes this weekend 20 years after the originals release barely registers as a cohesive film in any sense. Related Story The Last of the Great Escapist Blockbusters Instead its 25 minutes of plot stretched into a two-hour film that somehow feels interminable--and it doesnt even have the decency to blow up an American landmark along the way. Its easy to bleat about the current dependence on sequels and the lack of compelling movie stars but Independence Day Resurgence offers the most serious evidence yet for that kind of hand-wringing. Its a non-movie an insult to the blockbuster genre and should stand only as a perfect example of Hollywoods more glaring deficiencies as an industry. Its 1996 progenitor might have been the beginning of a shift toward expensive CGI endeavors but let Resurgence be the end before summer tentpoles decline any further.The director Roland Emmerich used to be a master of grand fiery nonsense. To this day his destruction of the White House and the Empire State Building in Independence Day is the pinnacle of disaster cinema a summit he tried to reach again and again with films like Godzilla The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. Those films at least made a solid effort to bring something original to the apocalypse from a new ice age to colossal tidal waves engulfing the worlds highest mountains. Resurgence doesnt want to repeat the national landmark-exploding tricks of its predecessor (theres even a sight gag involving the White House getting spared from destruction) so it opts for a baffling mess of doom an ocean-sized alien spaceship that somehow picks up Asia with its gravitational field and dumps it onto Europe. The scene is as confusing to behold as it is difficult to imagine.But to back up Resurgence is set 20 years after Independence Day in a society vastly different from our own augmented with alien technology harvested by the many city-sized motherships that crash-landed on Earth during the first invasion. Its a suitably bonkers idea and the some of the films early imagery can be fun to wrap your head around. Theres a rebuilt antique-y White House and Capitol Building surrounded by flying cars and sci-fi skyscrapers; a moon base doing deep-space defense research and trying to keep the planet safe; and a gaudy oil painting of Will Smith in his U.S. Air Force jacket to serve as a reminder of just what the films missing this time around.Steven Hiller Smiths character from the first film is gone having perished in a test flight (a frankly rude way to dispatch him) but his son Dylan (Jessie Usher) is there in his stead as is the former First Daughter Patricia Whitmore (now played by Maika Monroe) along with her love interest Jake Morrison (the reliably bland Liam Hemsworth). Returning from their 1996 adventure are the former President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) now bearded and plagued with visions of alien invasion; David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) now in charge of Earths extra-terrestrial defense; and his tetchy father Julius (Judd Hirsch) who in the intervening two decades has written a book and moved to a houseboat.""What goes up must come down"" Goldblum sighs as the remnants of Beijing are dumped upon London.The performances range from bemused (Goldblum maintains a sarcastic air throughout) to barely there particularly in the case of the films younger stars. Theres only a feeble effort to invest the latter with some backstory--Dylan is haunted by his fathers death Jake is a hothead driven by the loss of his parents in the 1996 attacks and Patricia is torn between a life of politics and piloting alien fighter jets. Smiths performance in Independence Day was electric and marked the birth of the kind of movie star Hollywood is lucky to get once in a generation. (Just imagine someone else punching an alien lighting a cigar and triumphantly saying ""Welcome to Earth."") His replacements unfortunately dont get anything like the same type of memorable material to work with.Earth has turned into a hybrid-alien superpower in the last 20 years but of course that doesnt matter once the aliens come back to finish what they started. ""Thats definitely bigger than the last one"" Goldblum deadpans upon seeing the 3000-mile-wide mothership that attaches itself to the planet like some giant limpet. ""What goes up must come down"" he sighs as the remnants of Beijing are dumped upon London. ""They like to go for the landmarks"" he snorts as Londons Tower Bridge is engulfed in an inferno.Independence Day had a genuine sense of threat--it orchestrated the nightmarish destruction of Washington New York and Los Angeles properly giving the event some heft and making it seem almost impossible to recover from. In Resurgence half the Earth is wiped out and it barely seems like a blip in the road. From the start the audience is led to believe theres some deus ex machina around the corner and so the story feels low-stakes--it never truly entertains the possibility that the villains could triumph in the end.The climactic battle involves a colossal alien queen slithering along some Utah salt flats while Judd Hirsch tools around in a school bus with some plucky teens which would sound fun if the whole exercise werent so insultingly perfunctory. By the time the film wraps things up and makes feeble promises of more alien-battling nonsense in a forthcoming sequel its obvious Emmerich has just been stalling for two hours. Thats Resurgence in a nutshell a film with 20 years of build-up that seems to exist only to cash a few paychecks and hopes viewers wont realize there isnt a single new idea in the entire picture.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

If you go back and watch it now its hard to see what all the fuss was about at the time. Its just silly popcorn disaster porn that had the bright idea of blowing up beloved monuments and the good fortune of catching Will Smith as his star was on the rise. But at least it was competent. The same cant be said for its disposable and shockingly inept sequel Independence Day Resurgence. Since Smith is too savvy these days (and too rich) to be seen anywhere near this mess the endless first third of the movie is a role call of some old and new faces - and strap in because there are a lot of them. Theres the stoic and unmemorable Jessie Usher as the heroic flyboy son of Smiths dead character; Liam Hemsworth as a cocky space pilot who so badly wants to be Tom Cruise in Top Gun that he should have ""Maverick"" stenciled on his jumpsuit; and Maika Monroe as his love interest who also happens to be the daughter of the president from the first film (Bill Pullman who also pops in long enough to get strangled by an aliens tentacles). Arthouse darling Charlotte Gainsbourg also swings by as a Franglais-speaking shrink harboring a tense romantic past with another character thats forgotten as abruptly as its first suggested. Representing the paycheck-cashing veterans of ""The War of 96"" are Jeff Goldblum as the resident brainiac (doing that Goldblumian thing where he distractedly stares off in the middle distance and says some techno-hokey gibberish that feels profound) Judd Hirsch as his proud papa (who gets to gawk at green-screen tidal waves and say things like ""Oh sweet Moses"") Brent Spiner as the nutty professor who snaps out of his 20-year coma just in time to threaten to kick alien ass and Vivica A. Fox (whos so unimportant to the story she should be wearing a red away-team uniform). Theres also a female president played by Sela Ward (yay) and Chinese actors Angelababy and Chin Han whose presence doubles as an insurance policy to rake in some overseas bucks in case Resurgence goes belly-up stateside like Warcraft. Together they try to figure out why the aliens who have been dormant for two decades are now waking up so grumpily and threatening humanity a second time. Sadly no one says the line ""Its like theyre...resurging"" So yes Earth is under attack. Former enemies must band together for the greater good. And tourist attractions get blown to smithereens. (Goodbye London.) But this time around theres nothing spectacular about it. Independence Day Resurgence has all the urgency of ticking off a to-do list. In the original film Emmerich - the Teutonic P.T. Barnum of CGI destruction - made the White House blowing up feel thrillingly taboo like a provocative act gone viral. In subsequent films like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 he milked that formula over and over again. But at this point theres just no milk left just a chapped teat and an angry cow. The money shots look cheap... and theyre a snooze. I cant remember ever feeling less invested in the fate of mankind. The only mild chuckle in entire the orgy of wreckage comes when Goldblum cracks to one of the new cast members ""They like to take out the landmarks."" I said mild. Apparently what these aliens also like is the magma at the Earths molten core. For some inexplicable reason they want it. So naturally theres an arbitrary race against time for our heroes to stop them from wiping us out and getting their slimy tentacles on it. What? Why? Who? When? How? I realize were dealing in the realm of kill-crazy space monsters here but Resurgence doesnt make a friggin lick of sense. That in and of itself is not something Im against. Ill go with nonsense as long as theres something else to hold onto - some shred or scintilla of smarts or spectacle to keep us entertained and distracted while were being condescended to. But Emmerich and his army of screenwriters (including original co-writer Dean Devlin) dont even bother with that. Instead what we get is a film whose idea of wit is having Liam Hemsworth take a leak on alien space ship while giving it the finger. Which in a sense is exactly what Independence Day does to its audience.

Twenty years after ""Independence Day"" stormed the summer box office and Will Smith announced himself as a major star in the making we get ""Independence Day Resurgence"" which is nothing more than a clunky cliche-riddled alien invasion movie from the 1950s B-movie playbook dressed up in 21st century special effects. A sampling of actual lines from the film ""Yaaaah"" ""Nobody else dies today"" ""Aaaargh"" ""They got me"" ""Yeeeeaaaaaah"" ""Is that an alien space gun?"" ""Grrraaaaaaahhhh"" ""Im not saving the world. Im saving YOU."" ""AAAAAAAAHHHH"" (The ""Yaaaah"" type lines are indicative of what various pilots ""say"" as theyre firing on the enemy or getting hit by the enemy. Theres a LOT of yelling the cockpits in this movie.) After showing initial interest in the sequel Smith dropped out. (Perhaps the disaster that was ""After Earth"" turned him off to further sci-fi adventures for a while.) Lucky Will. They killed off his character so not only does he avoid appearing in ""Resurgence"" theres virtually no chance (other than flashbacks) of him showing up in the third chapter which were threatened with at the end of this bomb. Were told Smiths Captain Hiller was killed in a training exercise. Gee after saving the world? Really Theres a cheesy painting of Captain Hiller hanging in a prominent spot in the White House and his son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher in a not-great performance) is carrying on his legacy as a hotshot pilot. ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is set in real time some 20 years after the great alien war of 1996 but in a parallel universe where all nations are united in peace and there hasnt been a sign of any giant slimy invading insect-looking creatures in two decades. As for alums of the original who do appear in the sequel a partial roster  Bill Pullman returns as (now former) President Whitmore who is haunted by nightmares and calls himself ""a crazy old man"" even as he warns the aliens are returning. He even sports a Lettermanesque beard to let us know hes no longer a part of the mainstream.  Jeff Goldblum is the best thing in the film seemingly amusing himself with droll line readings as David Levinson who has become the director of the Earth Space Defense. (Once the inevitable invasion occurs and major cities begin to fall Levinson dryly notes ""They like to take out the landmarks."")  Unfortunately Judd Hirsch also returns and once again hams it up beyond belief as Davids meddling annoying father who calls people ""putz"" and ""schmuck"" because you know hes Jewish. Among the newbies Liam Hemsworth is Jake Morrison the obligatory Gifted But Cocky Pilot Who Breaks All the Rules. Maika Monroe is the presidents daughter the obligatory Plucky Girlfriend Who Can Also Fly Jets. Nicholas Wright is Floyd the obligatory Government Dweeb Who Eventually Picks Up a Gun. Oh and Deobia Oparei is the warlord Dikembe Umbutu who specializes in killing aliens with his twin machetes. All right Ill admit thats a new one. All of these characters and far too many more are mired in a formulaic alien-invasion film that for all its massive 3D battle sequences and all its rousing music and all its attempts to make us care about these characters is one of the most uninvolving movies of the year. Everyone keeps talking about how the fate of the world is at stake and we see the destruction of countless cities meaning millions of lives have been lost -- but its bloodless from-a-distance destruction. Even when two of the younger characters witness the deaths of older relatives I doubt therell be a moist eye in the house. The ""Resurgence"" blueprint calls for a scene in which characters have human allegedly humorous and/or touching moments; a scene in which characters plot strategy against the aliens; and a big action sequence in which its often difficult to tell the difference between the good-guy spaceships and the bad-guy spaceships. Rinse and repeat rinse and repeat. Most of the performances in the film are as forgettable as the storyline and the special effects. Theres a lot of hugging and cheering and weeping and speechifying but precious little of it rings true. We see CGI explosions and battles and we cut to the actors in the cockpit or command central or squinting up at the sky and it just doesnt connect or resonate. ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is directed by Roland Emmerich whose credits include the first ""Independence Day"" ""White House Down"" ""10000 BC"" and the 1998 ""Godzilla."" He knows how to do slick and bombastic. Five writers teamed up for the screenplay.

But this follow-up to Emmerichs 1996 box-office powerhouse Independence Day is so dumb that it actually forces you to think--theres almost no other way to stay awake. Why have ostensibly intelligent actors agreed to deliver lines like ""Theyre going for our molten core"" ""Im coming back. I promise"" and my personal favorite ""Someone call a medical team""? How come we sometimes see an alien creature or two--theyre your generic moist spindly lizardlike things led by a giant all-powerful matriarch known as a harvester queen--and other times there are none in sight? Why does this movie have no sense of geography? One minute the movies fighter-pilot heroes are buzzing around the environs of the moon the next theyre sort of doodling around the Atlantic Ocean or near Washington. In the movies universe Earthlings have supposedly harnessed alien technology in the 20 years since these surly beasties first invaded. But really alien technology has only made us dumber. You can forgive Independence Day Resurgence for being ridiculous--its predecessor was too. But you cant forgive it for being boring. In 1996 director Emmerich ushered in the era of the modern disaster spectacle. Now hes just raking over its bones looking for more explosive ways to grab our attention. Everything in Independence Day Resurgence is so big that nothing has any meaning or any weight. All you need to know about the plot is that the alien presence we supposedly vanquished 20 years ago has once again reared its ugly head. Mayhem and mass destruction follow. As you may have seen in the movies trailer Londons Tower Bridge falls down but it happens so fast that you barely get time to relish it (if in fact you relish that sort of thing). When the Big Kahuna alien ship descends upon the Atlantic Ocean it does so in a big gray cloud lit through with orange flames kind of like a giant charcoal briquette. Its just not that exciting. The skyscraper-size harvester queen with her broad forehead saliva-slicked jaws and spidery limbs looks like just about every other alien weve seen since H.R. Giger designed the mother of them all for Ridley Scott in 1979. And what is Charlotte Gainsbourg so gloriously soft-spoken and ultra-cool doing in the middle of all this? The movie barely makes room for her. Much of the original cast (Jeff Goldblum Bill Pullman Judd Hirsch Brent Spiner) has returned with young actors (Liam Hemsworth Jessie T. Usher Maika Monroe) dotting the margins. The idea probably is to get multiple generations of moviegoers out to the cinemaplex but theres little these humans can do to breathe life into this brain-dead behemoth of a movie. Independence Day Resurgence works hard to seem progressive. Spiners character alien researcher Dr. Brakush Owen has been in a coma for 7300 days; his co-worker Dr. Isaacs (John Storey) has cared for him devotedly the whole time and though the nature of their union isnt explored as deftly as it might have been at least that relationship is there. Then theres the usual device of the feisty woman warrior--in this case Monroes Patricia Whitmore the daughter of Pullmans ex-prez Whitmore who brought down the aliens the first time around--getting the chance to show she can shoot down space creatures as well as the guys can. Maybe some of us would complain if that dynamic didnt even surface in Independence Day Resurgence--but its of no consequence anyway. Monroes scenes dont matter any more or less than anything else in the movie. Goldblum manages to rise above the proceedings via his invisible jetpack of dry wit--thank God for that. The only newcomer who emerges unscathed is Gainsbourg who glides through this mess with Zen equanimity--even as chaos reigns she keeps her cool. And once in a while the movie jolts itself out of its bombastic blandness with a silly clever touch like a vending machine that dispenses cartons of ""Moon Milk."" What is Moon Milk? What does it taste like? Does it come from moon cows--perhaps a colony descended from a certain adventurous bovine who tried to jump over the you-know-what and fell short of the mark? If you like me have questions about Moon Milk you wont find the answers in Independence Day Resurgence. But at least youll have something to think about while youre watching stuff get blowed up--even if its not in the immortal words of SCTVs Billy Sol Hurok getting blowed up real good.

Credit 20th Century Fox Film Corporation If youve seen one movie apocalypse you have seen them all at least if it was directed by Roland Emmerich. For the last two decades Mr. Emmerich has carved out his own perverse subgenre with mega-movies about mega-calamities in which a happy few fight joke and triumph despite alien invasion a radioactive lizard the Mayan calendar melting polar ice and scene after scene of computer-generated mayhem. Even when he scales down narrowing his cinematic gun sights on smaller stories (""White House Down"") Mr. Emmerich goes big and then bigger.So here he is again going once more unto the blockbuster breach with ""Independence Day Resurgence"" a sequel to ""Independence Day"" his amusing 1996 box-office behemoth. The earlier movie is best remembered for its shocker of a sales pitch a shot of the White House being blown up by a shaft of alien light an image that was as giddily funny as it was horrific to contemplate. Needless to say thinking deeply if at all has never been something that Mr. Emmerich encourages. For the most part his movies are engineered to generate autonomic responses with frenetic visuals and booming noises that activate the fight-or-flight response which in turn produces arousal. Video Trailer Independence Day Resurgence A preview of the film. By 20th CENTURY FOX PICTURES on Publish Date April 25 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Thats the hope although ""Resurgence"" is likely to spur more eye-drooping than popping. All you really need to know about the story is that it took multiple men to cook up this pottage which hinges on another extraterrestrial invasion and humanity battling aliens as other familiar struggles erupt technological determinism versus technophobia secular universalism versus heroic individualism. Five writers actually put their names on the script including Mr. Emmerich and his longtime collaborator Dean Devlin and the results are predictably predictable if rarely entertainingly risible with swaths of exposition and dialogue that sounds like ads (""one people one world"").The lackluster at times abysmal writing wouldnt much matter if ""Resurgence"" popped visually or featured a charismatic star who could lift a movie as effortlessly as Will Smith did in the first feature. Mr. Smith unfortunately declined to appear in the sequel leaving his two co-stars from ""Independence Day"" Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum to give it that old school try alongside veterans like Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner far and away the movies most valuable player. All deliver professional winking performances but theyre also stranded in an overly crowded cast that gives too much time to younger performers who for the most part slide right off the screen. Mr. Emmerich does manage to personalize this industrial production here and there largely in funny little asides that sprinkle the action like the cutaway to a character using his wipers to clean alien goo off a windshield. But too often he seems to be trying to summon up energy and dredge up feeling in this movie by glancing back at the first ""Independence Day"" as when Liam Hemsworth (as a flyboy) punches an alien an echo of Mr. Smiths ""welcome to Earth"" triumphalism. Except that Mr. Hemsworth a stolid pleasant actor isnt Mr. Smith and this isnt ""Independence Day."" Somehow selling screen death by the millions with a quip and a teardrop just doesnt cut it.""Independence Day Resurgence"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bloodless apocalyptic death. Running time 1 hour 59 minutes. Independence Day Resurgence Director Roland Emmerich Writers Nicolas Wright James A.

"Independence Day Resurgence is both impossible to take seriously or seriously dislike - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Independence Day Resurgence is both impossible to take seriously or seriously dislike Independence Day Resurgence Claudette Barius / 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Jeff Goldblum and Charlotte Gainsbourg in the movie ""Independence Day Resurgence."" Jeff Goldblum and Charlotte Gainsbourg in the movie ""Independence Day Resurgence."" (Claudette Barius / 20th Century Fox Film Corporation) Kenneth Turan A genial diversion for the undemanding ""Independence Day Resurgence"" doesnt hesitate to go where many films have gone before.Less a sequel than a spiritual remake of 1996s ""Independence Day"" this preposterous new film by returning director Roland Emmerich is both impossible to take seriously or seriously dislike. Not as feeble as 20th Century Foxs refusal to show it to critics would lead one to fear ""IDR"" not only uses many of the same stars as that alien-invasion predecessor it basically duplicates its plotline.But wait Those grotesque invaders have gotten smarter and more devious in the two decades since the last incursion and their spaceship has gotten way bigger Its a whopping 3000 miles in diameter. No wonder many in power fear ""this time we wont be able to stop them."" SNAP Video ""Independence Day Resurgence"" official trailer. ""Independence Day Resurgence"" official trailer. See more videos Though it took five credited writers (Emmerich and his original ""Independence Day"" partner Dean Devlin along with Nicholas Wright amp; James A. Woods and James Vanderbilt) to come up with the ""IDR"" script thudding dialogue lines like ""You better come and see this"" ""Make them pay"" and ""Oh my God"" are not going to put viewers in seats.Instead audiences will likely be lured by the films razzle-dazzle visuals of destruction overseen by visual effects supervisor Volker Engel (who won an Oscar for the first film) and production designer Barry Chusid.More than that as edited by Adam Wolfe ""IDR"" moves right along at the rapid clip essential for a story whose general outline is known from the get-go. What actually happens on screen is less important than that it unfolds really really fast. Remember how fun Independence Day was in 1996? Fox hopes Resurgence will bring you back there Steven Zeitchik Nostalgia is a polar kind of thing. Those of us who get it really get it. Those who dont spend much of their time haranguing the first group wondering why we continue to hang on to the gift card from that TCBY in our college town when we havent been back there in years and who ate TCBY after... Nostalgia is a polar kind of thing. Those of us who get it really get it. Those who dont spend much of their time haranguing the first group wondering why we continue to hang on to the gift card from that TCBY in our college town when we havent been back there in years and who ate TCBY after... (Steven Zeitchik) One of ""IDRs"" lessons (yes it has them) is that an alien invasion can be a good thing. The nations of Earth were so freaked out by whats now called ""The War of 1996"" that in the two decades since peace has reigned supreme on the planet. All that is about to end. Though President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) has been replaced in the White House he still suffers from whats called Alien Residual Condition meaning hes still plugged into the aliens invasive hive mind.Both he and scientist Dr. Brackish Okun (Brent Spiner)  miraculously awakened after 20 years in a coma are the first to know that those grotesque invaders (likely initially inspired by the work H.R. Giger did for the original ""Alien"") are headed back to Earth.Soon in the loop is scientist David Levinson (a returning Jeff Goldblum) now director of the Earth Space Defense Program and a French psychiatrist Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg of all people) who specializes in alien thought patterns.See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour >>Though Will Smiths character does not return he is represented by his hotshot pilot son Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) who is one of a group of younger folks as determined as their elders to give those aliens what-for. Independence Day revives a genre that has slept with the fishes since the 1950s Kenneth Turan With ""Independence Day Resurgence"" now in theaters revisit the first invasion in The Times original review of ""Independence Day"" which opened in theaters July 3 1996.

With ""Independence Day Resurgence"" now in theaters revisit the first invasion in The Times original review of ""Independence Day"" which opened in theaters July 3 1996. ""Independence Day"" is the Hollywood version of raising the dead. Its frankly spectacular special effects revive a genre that... (Kenneth Turan) Most entertaining of these is the man Hiller cant abide cocky fellow pilot Jake Morrison played with a nice sense of macho nonchalance by Liam Hemsworth. No wonder Whitmores squared-away daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe) has fallen in love with him.Nothing if not constructed with commercial success in mind ""IDR"" carefully balances new folks with returning older types.Yes David Levinsons father Julius played with Yiddish-inflected foolishness by Judd Hirsch is back but market dynamics mandate that space be been made for not one but two actors from China Chin Han as a tough general and model Angelababy as yet another hotshot pilot.Intent on breaching the Earths core for their own nefarious purposes the alien invaders have nothing but contempt for humanitys puny defenders until it is too late. Good thing for us that they are such slow learners.

He also suggested that Khans wife didnt speak because she was forbidden to as a Muslim and questioned whether Khans words were his own. ""Who wrote that? Did Hillarys script writers write it?"" Trump said in an interview with ABC News George Stephanopoulos. ""I think Ive made a lot of sacrifices. I work very very hard."" On the last night of the Democratic National Convention on Thursday Gold Star father Khizr Khan his wife Ghazala by his side recounted to the crowd how his son was killed in 2004 by a car bomb in Iraq. Khan also chastised Trump for seeking to ban Muslims from entering the country saying that his son U.S. Army Capt. Humayun Khan would not have been able to serve under a Trump presidency. ""Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America"" Khan said addressing Trump. ""You will see all faiths genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing and no one."" Trump appeared to try to brush the speech aside saying that Khan ""was you know very emotional and probably looked like a nice guy to me."" Trump also said ""If you look at his wife she was standing there. She had nothing to say. She probably maybe she wasnt allowed to have anything to say. You tell me."" Pressed by Stephanopoulos to name the sacrifices hed made for his country Trump said ""I think Ive made a lot of sacrifices. I work very very hard. Ive created thousands and thousands of jobs tens of thousands of jobs built great structures. Ive had tremendous success. I think Ive done a lot."" Trump also cited his work on behalf of veterans including helping to build a Vietnam War memorial in Manhattan and raising ""millions of dollars"" for vets. 59m ago 02 Lynne Sladky/AP Photo What to Know About First Local Zika Outbreak in Continental US Florida has become first state with known local transmission of Zika virus.

Maybe they can come up with a title with fewer syllables than ""Independence Day Resurgence."" Maybe the aliens will convince Will Smith to come back for the sequel. Or maybe they can shake up Hollywood and find something more interesting than a note-for-note remake of a movie thats been playing non-stop on cable for 20 years. The first ""Independence Day"" in 1996 was a rousing summer action movie success taking your cinematic hand and singing patriotic tunes on the way to victory up the alien flagships vulnerable metallic laser-shooting anus. It was a silly ending to a ridiculous film but it was fun. The sequel is even more silly and much less fun. Most of the movie seems to take place in green-hued catacombs and dark bunkers. With just a couple of exceptions everyone seems depressed or detached from the action. The 3D at its best looks like 2.5D. The new film feels like watching the first ""Independence Day"" with a bad hangover. ""Independence Day Resurgence"" wasnt screened for critics and there are some legit reasons to do that beyond the desire to hide a horrible movie. Highbrow critics dont always appreciate lowbrow genius. Marketing has expanded far beyond traditional media. And there may be a spoiler you dont want bouncing around on social media three days before the release of a film. Heres the only spoiler in ""Resurgence"" Almost every single plot point is exactly the same as the first movie. Jeff Goldblum reprising his role as scientist David Levinson offers a warning but no one listens. A hotshot pilot (Liam Hemsworth less fun than Smith) has problems with authority. The aliens descend and the earths forces take catastrophic losses. Theres a dog and it survives Bill Pullman gives another big speech ... This time the ship is the size of a continent and attaches itself to the side of the planet like a barnacle. But it has a weakness -- a vulnerability that makes the first Death Star look like a fantastic piece of self-preservational engineering by comparison. Which major actor will step up and make the Randy Quaid-style sacrifice up this latest design flaw in the alien ships abdominal canal? All of this would be forgivable if there was amusement to be had along the way. But the first half of ""Resurgence"" is gloomy with hardly any action. The Earth has adopted alien technology which only serves to distance the movie from its core humanity. All the glowing guns hovering spheres and moon bases make everything look like the planet is already long gone and everything was shot on a stage. Goldblum and Judd Hirsch as Levinsons dad Julius another carry-over from the first movie liven up their scenes. DeObia Oparei is the best newcomer as Dikembe an African warlord who has experience fileting the alien bad guys with twin katana swords. Those three and a few kids seem to possess the last bits of personality left on the planet. By the time the big battle happens at the end CGI has rendered the Earth bleak and unrecognizable; like its not worth saving. At best the dust kicked up by that Europe-sized alien spacecraft is going to cause a nuclear winter; at worst it knocks the planet off orbit and well go hurtling into the sun. Neither seems like a huge waste. Were told early in ""Independence Day Resurgence"" that wars between nations have ended since the events of the first film. But the rebuild lacks any artistic flair with a giant stadium erected in front of the White House -- like corporate forces have taken over removed original ideas and chosen to present the public with big dumb expensive things instead. Thats a metaphor for something. Hopefully it wont take until the next ""Independence Day"" sequel for Hollywood to figure it out. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicle pop culture critic.

There isnt but director Roland Emmerich makes a good show of faking it. Bill Pullmanwho played the alien-routing U.S. President last time has been replaced in the Oval by -- wait for it -- a woman (Sela Ward). But the old Prez is haunted by dreams of another alien invasion. (He must have read the script by Emmerich Nicolas Wright James A. Woods James Vanderbilt and Dean Devlin. Yes it took five scribes to come up with a plot that a computer could have programmed with more coherence and wit.) The alien leader is also -- wait for it -- a she. Luckily the reliably droll Jeff Goldblum is back as scientist David Levinson now a biggie in global defense. Goldblum flirts mischievously with French psychologist Dr Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg) but looks confused about why our defense base is located on the moon. Hell were all confused. If you want to enjoy even a few minutes of this sorry-ass sequel its best not to think. For those audiences waiting to learn what mega-star Will Smith does in the followup hes a no-show. Too bad because Smith who played a hero pilot and Goldblum made quite the alien-torturing comic pair in the original. (Maybe Big Willie thought the money wasnt right or he actually read the screenplay.) Jessie T Usher plays his characters son Dylan a pilot who mixes it up a lot with Jake another flyboy embodied by Liam Hemsworth with a blank-eyed dullness that makes you wonder what the ex-Presidents hottie daughter (Maika Monroe) sees in him. But come on you dont buy a ticket to something like this to see a soap opera with C-list acting. You want aliens. And you get them. At first theyre kind of cool in a creepy way. And then repetition dulls the effect. Finally you think is that all there is? Yup. The only thing resurgent in this humorless mess is Hollywoods passion to charge us more and deliver less.

Share Tweet The world wasnt exactly clamoring for a belated sequel to Roland Emmerichs 90s disaster movie par excellence Independence Day and especially not one that skimps on the colorful mass destruction and delivers only the first half of a plot teasing more to come. But Independence Day Resurgence deserves credit for at least putting some effort into realizing a post-alien-invasion Earth. Set in a militaristic alternate present enabled by reverse-engineered alien technology Emmerichs follow-up to his 1996 signature hit is much more of a pulp sci-fi movie than the original complete with dashing space pilots psychic African warlords and moon bases. Fun as it might be to watch Germanys premier exponent of conspiracy-theory-inspired big-screen annihilation channel his inner James Cameron Resurgence ends up falling victim to its attempts to differentiate itself while remaining completely derivative. Twenty years after city-sized flying saucers arrived to wipe out humanity only to be defeated by a Macintosh PowerBook the Earth is in a state of nominal peace. Its efforts are now directed toward global defense and its disproportionately young population--either orphaned by the invasion or born in the repopulation boom--has been raised to view Independence Days cast as something like demigods. Shrewdly the screenplay (credited to five writers including James Vanderbilt who once upon a time wrote Zodiac) hints that the originals America-centric rah-rah populism wasnt all it was cracked up to be. Given Emmerichs tendency to borrow from other 90s big-budget sci-fi movies--including an opening sequence in which Independence Days climactic speech makes its way through space riffing on the beginning of Contact--one almost wishes that the movie would go full Starship Troopers with its premise. Massive spacecrafts sit untouched in central Africa where fighting against the aliens--slimy squid-headed things encased in hulking exoskeletons--continued for another decade after victory was officially declared. Descendants of invasion-era heroes join ""legacy squadrons"" and are trotted out for photo ops. Area 51 now houses a prison for extraterrestrials. Survivors of the invasion and its aftermath bear deep psychic scars from their extended exposure to the aliens telepathic communication. President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) is now doddering and prematurely old looked after by Secret Service agents who make sure he takes his meds; Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner) the Area 51 scientist who served as a telepathic intermediary to a captured alien has been in a coma ever since; and Will Smiths Capt. Steven Hiller is a widely venerated Gagarin figure having perished in a test flight. As feared the aliens return just in time for a global celebration of the 20th anniversary of their defeat--this time in a 3000-mile-wide mothership whose gravitational pull briefly lets Emmerich show off his unparalleled knack for staging eye-popping large-scale destruction. Before that point Resurgence is basically a future-tech adventure flick with cable-repairman-turned-global-advisor David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) joining Dikembe Umbutu (Deobia Oparei) the machete-wielding leader of the self-styled Republic Of Umbutu and Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg) an alien-telepathy specialist and former flame on the hunt for clues. Theyre ferried around on a Cameron-esque ""space tug"" by Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) fiance of Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe) and archrival of Steven Hillers son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher).Lacking a charismatic movie-star lead in the mold of Will Smith in the original film Resurgence is able to zip along for its first act by simply introducing new environments technologies and soap-opera-ready relationships at a steady clip. But then comes the protracted climax one long air battle that devolves into a kaiju-style giant monster attack in the Bonneville Salt Flats. (At least its better than Emmerichs Godzilla.) Aside from the aforementioned mothership arrival--which gives the director another pass at the ""overturned toy box"" extravagance of 2012 a third go at destroying the (conveniently rebuilt) White House and a chance to ram the Petronas Towers through Tower Bridge--and a bit character inexplicably styled like Che Guevara Resurgence mostly avoids those mishmashes of instantly recognizable pop-culture iconography that have always been Emmerichs forte playing as straight action sci-fi instead.The directors stubborn commitment to the look sound and cornball humor of 90s blockbusters has its virtues. Its rare to see a movie this expensive and visually clear emphasizing every special-effects vista for maximum oomph regardless of whether audiences might still be impressed by spaceship interiors big enough to support their own ecosystems or panoramas of cities rebuilt with futuristic technology. But todays business model of preemptive franchising ends up getting the better of Resurgence. The movies dips into all-out space opera (interstellar travel more alien species etc.) are only meant to get the audience pumped for a movie that doesnt yet exist making the undistinguished climax seem like a skirmish. The fact that it mostly rests on the shoulders of the younger cast--either wasted or given too little screen time early on to matter--doesnt help.

David Ehrlich Jun 24 2016 143 pm davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""Independence Day Resurgence"" On July 2nd they arrive. On July 3rd they strike. On July 4th we fight back. On June 24th 2016 we...wish they had won. In the summer of 1996 Roland Emmerichs ""Independence Day"" reinvented the alien invasion genre for the blockbuster era using newfangled digital technology to make a B-movie big enough to bring the whole world together. Its reputation may be overinflated by millennials who subsist on a steady diet of their own petrified kitsch but Emmerichs war of the worlds has nevertheless come to represent a type of full-bodied studio spectacle for which we all ought to be nostalgic. In fact the self-described ""master of disaster"" seems really pissed at the people who arent. His lazy insult of a sequel -- threatened since the day the first movie first cast its long shadow over Americas multiplexes -- is ultimately nothing more than a giant middle finger to a generation of ungrateful moviegoers who didnt appreciate how good they had it ""If you ingrates thought that was bad"" Emmerich cackles from behind the camera ""you aint seen nothing yet."" Every generation thinks that things were better in their day but -- if alien invasion movies have taught us anything -- its that some warning signs shouldnt be ignored. When considered in respect to the original ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is an immaculate case study in how far blockbusters have fallen. Where ""Independence Day"" had a wide cast of charismatic actors ""Resurgence"" plugs in their Costco brand generic counterparts. Where ""Independence Day"" exhibited the patience of classic studio filmmaking crescendoing to the alien attack by wracking up the tension for more than an hour ""Resurgence"" scrambles for its money shots as though its afraid that audiences might click away to something more interesting. Where ""Independence Day"" was written with the gusto of a game-changer and the scale of an extinction-level event ""Resurgence"" unfolds with the cynical grace of a cash-grab and the stakes of a shareholders meeting. The first movie showed the world something it had never seen before; this sequel shows the world something we hope to never see again. As satellite technician David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum bless his heart) ominously intones before the aliens drop Singapore onto London ""What goes up must come down."" Except thats not true because one of the first things we learn in the movie (via the blunt force trauma of embarrassingly transparent exposition) is that gravity no longer applies in a world graced with alien technology. When the slimy invaders retreated back into space after the events of the previous film they left behind the tools required for humans to rebuild their planet and create a defense base on the moon. But that knowledge has come at a cost Those who survived close encounters with the extraterrestrials are plagued by the same terrifying nightmare and all of their children have matured into adults with no discernible personalities whatsoever (thats an observation not a plot point). While President Whitmore (Bill Pullman delegating 95% of his performance to his beard) obsessively draws a symbol that looks like the power button of a laptop his grown daughter Patricia (""It Follows"" star Maika Monroe controversially replacing Mae Whitman) stands behind him and looks conventionally attractive. Were told that fight pilot Steven Hiller (Will Smith) died in a training mission between films (sure why not) but dont worry because his step-son Dylan -- a child in the first film now an adult played by Jessie T. Usher -- has replaced him in the cockpit. ""Independence Day Resurgence"" A quick note about Dylan Hiller In a movie featuring spaceships the size of the Atlantic Ocean his truly staggering dullness might be the most unrealistic detail -- the character displays less charm over the course of these two hours than Will Smiths actual son packs into his average tweet. Say what you will about Big Willies recent career moves but his absence leaves this movie with a cratering hole of charisma. Big movies need big personalities to power them and watching Usher and Hemsworth try to carry a large chunk of this studio tentpole is like watching someone try to fuel a race car with two AA batteries. Theres been a lot of talk about how brands are the new celebrities but ""Resurgence"" is gallingly dull proof that the star system was a galaxy worth saving. READ MORE Jeff Goldblum And Ed Harris Reflect On ""The Right Stuff"" We never learn who begat renegade pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) but we can only assume that his parents were an Abercrombie catalogue and an errant piece of plywood that Emmerich found on set. Anyway some ominous crap happens all of which suggests that the two decades between the two ""Independence Day"" movies was a lot more interesting than what happens in this misbegotten sequel (theres a strong ""District 9"" vibe to how human civilization -- and one African tribe in particular -- has engaged with the aliens who were left stranded on our planet but the film brushes right over it). And then 20 years to the day since the first wave arrived (what are the odds) the invaders return with a vengeance. When the carnage starts it feels like the work of a guy who has destroyed the world so many times that hes completely lost sight of how insane it would be to watch the apocalypse firsthand. Never in the history of cinema has global annihilation felt so weightless and routine -- one established character dies in the background of a wide-shot during the first act but Emmerich cuts away with such a hilariously pronounced degree of indifference that the moment bypasses ""cold"" and moves straight on to ""rude."" Special effects have emptied filmmakers of their empathy so inured to leveling Earths cities that theyve forgotten what carnage really feels like. Dr. Manhattan may have evolved into a God but he sure would have been a terrible director. Only in its craziest chintziest moments does ""Resurgence"" recapture the B-movie spark that made the original so much fun. Without spoiling the storys only unpredictable digressions (this subplot is hatched very early on) it can be said that humans are confronted with a second extraterrestrial force in this film. And it. Is. Hilarious. A mysterious space MacGuffin that feels as though it was beamed directly from an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" this nameless white sphere exists for no other reason than to map a broader Independence Day Cinematic Universe. But the corporate transparency of its purpose is completely eclipsed by the goofiness of its role in the plot and the breathtakingly stupid dialogue it inspires. Its also worth noting that the fate of the (newly rebuilt White House) results in a sight gag thats worthy of Pixar. Twenty years and 200 million in the making and thats what were left with. That and a valuable lesson that you can read between the lines Nostalgia is a powerful thing but just because you ache for the past doesnt mean that the present isnt significantly worse.

A 20 year gap between films. This had poo hitting the fan written all over it before it even got made. Reply Michael Pratt June 24 2016 214 pm I cant stand movie bashing articles like this. It takes an army of people to be able to make a movie to create something from an idea. From the producers and directors to the lowlife st stage hand blood sweat and tears and sometimes years of life are spent just for the purpose of trying to entertain us to let us escape the problems of life if only for an hour or two. If you dont like the movie thats fine but why get on a soapbox and bash it? Get a life why dont you. All movies are a kind of magic for me and should be for all of us. Reply Ken June 28 2016 514 pm I recognize it takes hard work to make a movie. It doesnt mean that the final product is always good. Reply R Tomato July 1 2016 929 am Dear Michael Pratt And to think Ed Wood did the very same thing with just a handful of people. Odd I do believe Ed Wood did it better too. Now go get your nice warm cup of chamomile tea and relax. IF you dont like reviews then dont read them. This ""movie"" has displaced BvS as the worst big budget film of 2016 by a landslide. Reply Jeffrey Blair June 24 2016 434 pm Thanks for the review as I will now go ahead and buy something else... before the Earth is destroyed (fingers crossed)... with the 10 I was going to waste on a movie ticket Reply Jeffrey Blair June 24 2016 437 pm Okay in all honesty I would probably have spent that 10 on movie ticket to see Finding Dory and then snuck in to this movie later on. Now I can at least focus my efforts on sneaking into another movie. Reply Je Vizzusi June 24 2016 1041 pm The publicity Cast Still for ID II look like a AARP Convention Reply Pip Nosher July 26 2016 851 am Michael - This is not a ""movie bashing article"" it is a review. And the army of people you reference just as often spend years hoping to make a pile of money. If we are entertained in the process that presents the possibility of those people making more money. Which makes me wonder why they dont try harder. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

We lose indepdence-day-resurgence-boat-sea-ship.jpg Enormous mechanical overpowering Thats the alien ship in ""Independence Day Resurgence."" Thats the movie too (FOX) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 24 2016 at 856 AM updated June 24 2016 at 908 AM comments Whenever a studio refuses to screen a movie before it opens theres really only one unspoken assumption behind it You critics really wouldnt like this thing anyway. Thats the studios choice of course but its a rare one. And its almost unheard of for a movie like ""Independence Day Resurgence"" a would-be blockbuster with a budget of 165 million. Really how bad could it be? Um this bad. A sequel to the 1996 sci-fi success ""Independence Day Resurgence"" picks up 20 years after the last one. It seems that before expiring the invading aliens sent out a distress signal. Somewhere something finally got the message. And theyre coming back. And this time they mean business. If only the movie did. It drags back a lot of the stars. Not Will Smith. Will Smith apparently had something more challenging to do with his time like maybe putting together a reunion show with Jazzy Jeff. Or continuing to smile patiently at Jada Pinkett Smith. But Bill Pullman is back as the now-retired prez and Jeff Goldblum returns as the character who seems to explain all the scientific stuff but never really does. Judd Hirsch Im sorry to say returns too as his kvetchy dad. Oh and Vivica A. Fox is back as well. Remember her? In the first film she was Smiths live-in and a stripper. Now shes a doctor. So OK at least the last two decades have been good to her. Her old character though was a pretty good example of how director Roland Emmerich thinks of minorities which is basically in lazy stereotypes. Black woman? Stripper. Jewish guy? Cowardly for sure but also funny. Those people theyre all funny MORE What Hollywood gets wrong about sci-fi It would be pretty offensive if the movie gave you any chance to think about it. But the film just keeps introducing new characters (dull Liam Hemsworth and Hong Kong star Angelababy as astronauts). Subplots too. At one point we switch to a salvage operation in the Atlantic; another time were deep in Africa with a brutal warlord. Why? Who knows? Who cares? Time to blow up another city or bring on a cute kid or a puppy in peril or any of the dozen other cliches this dumb movie is made up out of. At least the first movie had a certain mindless excitement to it (as long as you could ignore Randy Quaid back then only pretending to be nuts). There was something funny in all the L.A. flakes running into the streets to welcome the aliens and a genuine shock when the invaders exploded the White House. But ""Independence Day Resurgence"" isnt silly its stupid. Everything is too big too loud too confusing. But then it wasnt made for us. It was made for foreign markets where dialogue counts for little and special effects are everything. (Theres a reason why Angelababy is in this and why a good chunk of the destruction is set in China.) So yes I have to admit it the studio was right I didnt like ""Independence Day Resurgence."" You probably wont either. But itll make its money somewhere and thats all that counts. Hollywood doesnt care where its money comes from as long as it comes. Even if its only 12 from a cranky critic like me. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language Independence Day (PG-13) Fox (120 min.) Directed by Roland Emmerich. With Jeff Goldblum Bill Pullman Liam Hemsworth Vivica A. Fox. Now playing in New Jersey.  Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty.

Fox thrilled to be back for long-awaited sequel Independence Day Resurgence Los Angeles premiere Independence Day Resurgence and the best alien invasion films of all time Independence Day drowned out by Finding Dory at box office Independence Day Resurgence flop 12 sequels that are worse Want to see things blow up good? Independence Day Resurgence really delivers. However if you like a bit of story to go with all those explosions -- forget it. The trade-off for a few seconds of spectacular global destruction is an incomprehensible bloated mess of a script. The movie is a pile-on of extraneous characters meaningless events and unnecessary references to the original movie all tied together -- badly -- by enough expository chit-chat to leave you feeling beaten into submission. But hey nothings perfect. Long story short the aliens are coming back. We know this because their abandoned spacecraft in Africa has suddenly lit up by itself the captive aliens have gone from catatonic to hysterical the Saturn space station has vanished and Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) has just awakened from a lengthy coma. And a big-ass spaceship has just begun demolishing the earth. Who is there to save the day? Liam Hemsworth as a brash young pilot Jessie T.

Hemsworth does brash young pilot-y things. Everybody else mostly just talks. PRO The aliens come back with a vengeance destroying almost all the major monuments you can think of. The people and buildings in one city float skyward as gravity vanishes. Theres an aerial dogfight to rival Star Wars. CON Meanwhile former President Whitmore is worried. The men on a salvage ship in the ocean are hired to observe the aliens go after the earths core. Brakish Okun helps determine that not all aliens are enemies. The pilots are sent en masse to go after the alien queen. Levinsons father Julius guides a busload of possibly orphaned kids. The alien queen strikes back. The audience has no clue what the hell is going on. SUPERCON The groundwork is laid for another sequel. Dont say you werent warned.

"Independence Day Resurgence review Will Smiths the lucky one - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Independence Day Resurgence review Will Smiths the lucky one Video Independence Day Resurgence trailer Watch the trailer for ""Independence Day Resurgence."" Watch the trailer for ""Independence Day Resurgence."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune From the metallic shell of the 1996 smash ""Independence Day"" director Roland Emmerich has pulled a seriously lousy sequel dripping with alien goo and incoherence.I take no pleasure in reporting this news folks. Ive been a lonely half-mad defender of some of Emmerichs cheesiest cheese including ""10000 B.C."" But ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is the Emmerich movie his fiercest detractors always said he could manage if he put his mindlessness to it. Will Smith star of the original passed on the sequel. Smart move. The list of performers who thought instead ""Oh what the hell its money and how bad can it be?"" include the beloved Jeff Goldblum back as scientist and alien-defense expert David Levinson but this time pushed into strained panic-reaction shots throughout.Bill Pullman now the ex-president (Sela Ward plays the current U.S. leader at least for a while - spoiler alert) is haunted by visions of a second alien invasion. Judd Hirsch returns as Goldblums dad who commandeers a school bus full of orphaned preteens. Brent Spiner boomerangs back in long gray wig and finally roused from a 20-year coma (""How long was I out?"" he says in the films sole amusing line) as Dr. Brackish Okun obsessed with alien technology. Then theres a fleet of calculatedly diverse 25(ish) hotshots spearheaded by brash uninteresting (here anyway) Liam Hemsworth; Jessie T. Usher portraying the son of the original Will Smith character; Maika Monroe as the former prezs jet pilot daughter engaged to Hemsworths ""Top Gun""-inspired maverick. Theyre joined by among others the Chinese actress Angelababy as Rain Lao who plays another pilot hanging around the defense base established on the moon. Soon these pups are pressed into dogfight service while the sound effects go ""Ptew Ptew"" and the audience wonders Honestly is this the best human/alien aerial dogfight ya got? How Independence Day Armageddon and others bred the schlockbuster Michael Phillips I cant believe Im defending the disaster-movie schlock of my adolescence but here we go. As a 6-foot-2-inch 59-pound teenager with a voice that broke over a period of several awkward squeaky millennia I saw ""Earthquake"" in a crouch position inside one of the Sensurround speakers parked behind... I cant believe Im defending the disaster-movie schlock of my adolescence but here we go. As a 6-foot-2-inch 59-pound teenager with a voice that broke over a period of several awkward squeaky millennia I saw ""Earthquake"" in a crouch position inside one of the Sensurround speakers parked behind... (Michael Phillips) The aliens suck entire cities into the sky and then plop them back down. A kid rescues a puppy. The queen-bee alien (its a she so that someone can call her a b---- during the climax) chases the little yellow school bus like an angry commuter running after the 146 down Michigan Avenue. The tonal switchbacks from camp to action to wisecracks to exposition to action again could give you whiplash and so little of it clicks you wonder if screenwriters Nicolas Wright James A. Woods Dean Devlin James Vanderbilt and Emmerich ever read each others drafts or versions of scenes before spitting out a revision.Theres a new bigger UFO 3000 miles in diameter which is just dumb. When your UFO is 3000 miles wide your movie threatens to lose all sense of dramatic scale. Watching ""Resurgence"" a subtitle better suited to the ""Divergent"" franchise its clear straight off You can up the ante all you like and wipe out major world landmarks. But if your witty asides arent witty and your digital effects look like so much else youve seen the last few years and your editing (Adam Wolfe takes the blame) juggles the various plotlines so ineptly ... then you have a movie like this one. Characters keep talking about comas and boredom and how tedious reunions are and you know exactly what they mean.What I remember best from the first ""Independence Day"" are two things the alien autopsy scene icky and startling and suspenseful and in the final confrontation Goldblum and Smith taunting the alien like a couple of kids. Those scenes I remember. I saw ""Resurgence"" an hour and a half ago and I feel like an alien wiped my memory clean already.

(Photo Claudette Barius)Yes theyre back those personality-free aliens who attacked before only smarter and madder and this time the queen is in tow. OK no problem lets just call Will Smith and ... oh wait. Smith declined to appear in the sequel (though a photo of him in his flight suit does). Most of the rest of the cast and characters from the first film are back though among them Jeff Goldblum as David Levinson again the only real hope to figure out how to repel the aliens and Bill Pullman as former President Thomas Whitmore who despite the lofty title again remains the brawn of the operation.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceThe best of the newcomers is Maika Monroe as Patricia Whitmore -- like her dad the former president a fighter pilot though shes got a cushy job at the White House. Less impressive are Jessie T. Usher as Dylan Hiller the son of Smiths character and Liam Hemsworth as Jake Morrison a sort of Chuck Yeager of the pilot bunch.Talking about the plot in a movie like this is like talking about the quality of coleslaw at an all-you-can-eat barbecue buffet. Nobody cares about the side dishes just give us the main course -- explosions and action sequences in this case of which there is a mind-numbing plenty. Even they however are outnumbered by the disparate plot threads almost none of which are worth caring about.Fighter pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) and his squadron are briefed on plans to combat an alien invasion in ""Independence Day Resurgence."" (Photo Claudette Barius)But duty calls so here goes Since the last invasion weve figured out how to meld some of the alien technology with our own. Some of this know-how goes into building a bigger and better defense system against invading aliens. Live and learn all that. But -- and maybe this is a spoiler alert but such a thing hardly seems possible in a movie like this -- all of that gets wiped out in about the time it takes to read this sentence.So its back to good ol human gumption to save us. Along with intelligence much of it provided by Brent Spiners Brakish Okun who wakes up from a coma to help figure out whats going on.Look this isnt supposed to be Serious Cinema. I get that. I also know that there is a cinematic place for over-the-top action. I also know that it doesnt have to be stupid because I saw ""Mad Max Fury Road.""In ""Independence Day Resurgence"" Vivica A. Fox returns as Jasmine Hiller widow of Steven Hiller (Will Smith) from the first film. (Photo Claudette Barius)Some people will doubtless flock to this because stuff gets blowed up real good (though not the same landmarks as in the original). These are the same people who for reasons I cant fathom talk about the first ""Independence Day"" like it was some kind of alien-invasion ""Citizen Kane"" or something. It wasnt. But it was smarter and more fun than this.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestThe size of that alien ship is crucial. Its so big it has its own gravitational field; it probably has several ZIP codes. But at some point things get so big they dont mean anything anymore. They defy comprehension. Thats true of a ship that large and its true of ""Independence Day Resurgence."" Its massive but it doesnt really mean a thing.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Article Continued BelowWriter/director Roland Emmerich and his screenwriting co-conspirators apparently dont.

(Photo Credit Claudette Barius / 20th Century Fox)  Jeff Goldblum stars as David Levinson and Bill Pullman as Thomas Whitmore in a scene from ""Independence Day Resurgence."" (Claudette Barius/Twentieth Century Fox via AP)  (Claudette Barius / AP)   ""Im not saving the world ... Im saving you"" as one character puts it.The 1996 Independence Day had a certain craptastic appeal since it was early in the CGI revolution and watching flying saucers explode global landmarks could still inspire popcorn awe. The movie also boasted a pre-superstar Will Smith as a cocky flyboy who chased down and sucker punched an icky space thingy before smoking a celebratory cigar.Smith is gone and so are any of the ripe pleasures of Emmerichs campy excess cheesy dialogue and all. The film is so cluttered with characters exposition and space junk thickly lacquered with 3D its like a party pinata waiting to burst open - but inside are rocks not toys.Emmerich has reconvened much of the original cast of Independence Day and given them even dumber things to do and say. This includes Jeff Goldblum as brainiac satellite engineer David Levinson now an official planetary defender; Bill Pullman as the now bewhiskered befuddled and benched U.S. President Whitmore who has vivid nightmares of an impending return attack; and oddball scientist Brackish Okun (Brent Spiner) who has been in a coma for the past 20 years but who might just spark back into action when duty calls as it eventually does.Everybody else has gotten down to exploiting the technology left behind by the vanquished aliens leading to laser guns anti-gravity tech and a military moon base that has helped all the nations of the world ""put their petty differences aside"" as the Clintonesque new U.S. President Lanford (Sela Ward) insists not too convincingly.Top Gun-style flying aces played by Liam Hemsworth Jessie Usher Maika Monroe Jessie Usher and Travis Tope (who looks distractingly like Canadas Xavier Dolan) along with Chinas Angelababy are on hand to actually exchange fire with marauding aliens when the fussing and posturing finally ceases on both sides of the galaxy. Somebody has to set up the third film in this ineluctable franchise.It says it all about Independence Day Resurgence that were meant to care more about romances and reunions than about whether major cities are shaked-and-baked by an even bigger alien mothership than before.The reunions do offer the possibility of comic relief as in the case of Levinson and his self-aggrandizing papa (Judd Hirsch).""What we have to wait until the end of the world for us to get together?"" Levinson Sr. kvetches to his son. It beats waiting for another Independence Day sequel dad.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Returning director Roland Emmerichs film checks all the appropriate boxes -- wanton destruction malevolent aliens B-movie dialogue rampant silliness -- but the old charm just isnt there anymore.Resurgence does age in real time from the first Independence Day. The aftermath of the ""War of 96"" has brought two decades of new alien technology melded with ours a major worldwide rebuilding project and a complete lack of armed conflict between countries. Of course that utopia ends again on July 4 when a new all-out alien assault -- led by a seriously irked queen -- begins with the arrival of a cosmic monstrosity 3000 miles in diameter with its own gravity field. (How else would the thing pick up all of Asia and drop it on Europe? R.I.P. Big Ben.)USA TODAYJeff Goldblum enjoys a brainy ResurgenceCharacters old and new scramble to deal with the world-threatening menace. Bill Pullmans ex-president Thomas Whitmore is crippled psychologically thanks to an old alien encounter -- and a point of concern for his daughter (Maika Monroe) -- but he gets one more chance for a go-get-em speech. And Brent Spiners wacky Area 51 scientist Brackish Okun thankfully has a lot more to do after being the equivalent of an extraterrestrial walkie-talkie in the first film.Liam Hemsworth is an ace fighter pilot with some issues in ""Independence Day Resurgence."" (Photo Claudette Barius)Will Smiths goofy bravado in Independence Day is desperately missing -- his character Steven Hiller is written out of the sequel courtesy of a fatal test-flight accident. Too bad because his hotshot son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) and estranged flyboy best buddy Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) both fail to fill that macho void. Lets just say Hemsworth urinating in an alien spaceship doesnt nearly have the same panache as Smith coldcocking a rival space invader.The sequel squanders most of its female characters especially Sela Wards President Lanford. It also doesnt do any favors for Jeff Goldblum. His David Levinson ordinary cable guy turned globe-saving genius in the original was the other major lead from the first movie who now heads up Earth Space Defense. Yet hes mostly kept on the periphery and relegated to one of many many side stories in Resurgence. Surprisingly the sheer number of subplots overshadow the special-effects spectacle though at least David gets a couple of nice character moments with his dad (Judd Hirsch) in a movie severely lacking them.USA TODAYBill Pullman celebrates Independence Day againRidiculousness needs to abound somewhat in a film like this -- reality takes a seat early and often here -- but Resurgence pushes everything to an egregiously over-the-top and often infuriating degree. Characters get out of certain doom way too easily our heroes seem to have endless time to thwart the alien queens apocalyptic plans and a deus ex machina is introduced in the form of a weird intergalactic ball that also manages to set up the threequel.Not that mankind needs another one. Weve already celebrated our Independence Day once and this mess just isnt worth the fireworks. 4608 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 41 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/28QEczc",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/24/review-independence-day-resurgence/86319292/,200,independencedayresurgence21,independencedayresurgence,usatoday

PG-13 (sci-fi action). Now playing. Whats happened in the 20 years since ""Independence Day delighted audiences? Well for one thing scientific genius Jeff Goldblum is now older than Judd Hirsch was when he played Goldblums cranky father. The two characters have a reunion that lasts all of 90 seconds in the joyless snoozefest ""Independence Day Resurgence one of a litany of bad ideas in a script so awful that dethroned box-office king Will Smith turned down a chance to reprise his signature role. Instead we get charisma-free Jessie Usher ninth-billed as the flyer son of Smiths now-deceased hero haplessly vying with boring top gun Liam Hemsworth for the attention of Maika Monroe portraying the daughter of Bill Pullmans president in the first film. Pullman shows up to collect a paycheck as does ""1D4 veteran Brent Spiner as a brainiac who emerges from a 20-year coma (after two hours of this mind-numbing nonsense youll know exactly how he felt).

Meet Jessie Usher the new hero of Independence Day Resurgence The first ""Independence Day was a lot of fun with great lines and cutting-edge special effects. It was much imitated so the sequel plays like a faded eighth-generation copy with a cast thats shooting blanks when it comes to humor. There isnt a singular memorable scene -- like Smith punching out the alien in the first film -- or any shot like the destruction of the White House the first time around. And demolishing cities like London is getting really old. The story is a patchwork of plot elements that dont fit together and the film is so badly edited that it somehow feels twice as long as the original even though its actually half an hour shorter. The design elements look like they were recycled from a dozen other blockbusters. Set on an alternate Earth where peace has reigned for the last two decades the bloated ""Independence Day Resurgence is listlessly directed by returnee Roland Emmerich.

The aliens that attacked the Earth 20 years ago in Independence Day return for a second go-round this time minus Will Smith who used the original movie to transform from sitcom star to legit matinee idol. If Independence Day Resurgence proves one thing its how good Smith is at his job. Smiths Capt. Steve Hiller is dead and gone. Theres a gaping charisma hole in Resurgence that cant be filled by the alien-fighting newbies (Independence Day The New Class?) led by Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) Jessie T. Usher (Survivors Remorse) and Maika Monroe (It Follows). But theyre not exactly given a lot to work with. Smith has a knack for the one-liners but ""Get ready for a close encounter bitch"" doesnt necessarily have the same panache as ""Welcome to Earth."" Jeff Goldblums David Levinson and Bill Pullmans President Whitmore are back for Round 2 so they can essentially do the same thing they did the first time--in Levinsons case act as the nebbish genius lothario while Whitmore is the warrior-leader. Although this time these characters spend a lot more time explaining an unnecessarily complicated plot thats essentially in place to set up yet another sequel. Its best not to get into it. But like its predecessor Resurgence is a spectacle. I remember sitting in the theater watching the first Independence Day as a kid mouth agape at what the movies could do. Im a little more cynical at this point. Ive seen what the movies can do for the past 20 years and the aliens already destroyed the White House so watching them target more cities feels like a retread which feels weird to say. Cities decimated? Yawn. But it wouldnt be summer if things didnt blow up onscreen. And boy do things sure blow up. While the plot is dumb and the script is worse watching aliens explode in spectacular fashion isnt the worst excuse to spend to two hours in air-conditioning.

TWITTER 6/24/2016 The gangs all back (minus Will Smith) as Jeff Goldblum Bill Pullman and friends join Liam Hemsworth and other new recruits in a fight against space invaders. Its been 20 years since Independence Day blew up the White House and blazed new trails with blockbuster records. Now the franchise is back with the instructively if somewhat literal-mindedly titled Independence Day Resurgence. Obviously audiences will not be asking if it is bigger louder or a better showcase than its predecessor for state-of-the-art visual effects. No one really wants to know if most of the old cast that could be persuaded to come back have signed on again and whether they are joined by a younger sequel-ready generation of actors. And surely only a fool would query whether the new entry is full of ludicrous science jokes that demonstrate it doesnt take itself seriously and world monuments being turned to sand-grain-fine rubble and toxic waste. Because the answer to all those questions is duh of course. Surely the only real questions anyone wants to know at this stage are just how many squillions will it end up making worldwide and is there a scene where a dog is saved at the last minute from immolation and flying debris. The answer to that last question is also duh of course (a cute little terrier-like pup this time in place of the originals golden retriever). But when it comes to box-office prospects this could be a tricky one to call. Jurassic World recently proved that reboots of 1990s-era properties can draw big numbers with the right kind of retro-fitting. But then again as many a busted flush has shown recently brand-name recognition and massive marketing campaigns arent enough to guarantee returns. In the endless rinse-and-repeat cycles of contemporary sci-fi-inflected action movies set-pieces that ID4 helped popularize in the first place and which its sequel reprises look a little stale here because they have already been ripped off and rejigged countless times. Monument destruction for example is taken to heroic new heights in Resurgence as Malaysias Petronas towers are carried halfway around the world to send Londons Tower Bridge falling down like the first round in some kind of architectural destruction tournament. The main thing filmgoers will be looking for from Resurgence is bang-for-buck entertainment and that it delivers reasonably successfully. Although the pics 120-minute running time sometimes feels draggier than its predecessors 145-minute sprawl returning writer-director-producer Roland Emmerichs knack for the pomp of vast-scaled destruction fist-pumping moments of triumph and cornpone jocularity remains undiminished. This sort of entertainment is his happy place. Its noble of him to want to try and give something back to the gay community with a low-budget misfire like last years LGBT history lesson Stonewall. But Resurgence arguably will do more to promote positive images of gay men by featuring Brent Spiner and John Storey as a pair of devoted lovers willing to die for each other and humanity. Huge leggy insectoid queens -- and no were not talking about drag superstars -- are at the center of the sequel. Its 20 years on from the events of the first film and on an alternative version of Earth there are hover planes using some kind of anti-gravity gizmo observatories and defense systems on the moon while a Hillary Clinton-like woman serves as U.S. president (Sela Ward). Even though the upside of the last alien invasion is apparently that weve had 20 years of peaceful coexistence and no war it would seem that America is still top dog because its Madam President who gets the deciding vote as to whether to shoot the crap out of a new alien spacecraft when it appears on the horizon. At least she gives the order with a heavy heart even though chief alien detection expert David Levinson (a returning Jeff Goldblum) advises against destroying the newcomer because it doesnt look like it was made by the same alien race. Turns out hes right There is a third set of ETs floating about which take the form of shiny white levitating orbs. They look like Eve in Pixars WALL-E crossed with a giant volleyball but with the voice of a teenage girl and a not dissimilar attitude. (She calls our civilization ""primitive"" because we still have bodies.) Many screenwriting hands -- Dean Devlin Nicolas Wright James A. Woods James Vanderbilt and Emmerich himself -- have made surprisingly light work of meshing together a plot thick with incident and characters new and old. The action toggles regularly back and forth between various locales in inner and outer space. Along with Goldblums Levinson returning characters include now former President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) whos suffering from Alien Residual Condition a kind of post-traumatic syndrome but with telepathic torment thrown in for good measure. Like others who had close encounters with the invaders the first time around -- Spiners long-haired boffin Brakish Okun African warlord Dikembe (Deobia Oparei) -- Whitmore has dreams and visions of a symbol (it looks like a circle with a half dash through it surely the universal icon for the power-on switch?) as the aliens approach. According to his ESP early warning system this time around the returning aliens are bringing their queen. And shes pissed. Ready to take her on is a new generation of feisty trigger-happy younguns including war orphan turned hotshot pilot Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) whos engaged to Whitmores all-grown-up daughter Patricia (the compelling Maika Monroe from It Follows) a soldier in her own right. Both are friends with Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) the son of Will Smiths character from ID4. He apparently perished in a test flight years before which heroically covers up Smiths absence from the cast although hes hardly missed with such a crowded roster. Theres barely time to work in Dylans mother (Vivica A. Fox) before she must suffer a fate like so many others on the planet. But at least she got to be a doctor an improvement over her stripper job in the first film. The female characters get slightly better positions and plotlines this time round what with the female president lady fighter pilots -- not just Patricia but also Angelababys top girl gun Rain from China; and Charlotte Gainsbourg is on hand as a psychiatrist love interest for Goldblums Levinson. (No one bats an eye over the 20-year age gap between them so some things are pretty much the same in this alternative universe.) In any case few will come seeking a politically correct representation of a utopian future. The whole point of this franchise is watching a lot of alien butt get kicked and their slimy scrawny tushes are well and truly whopped here in gloriously rendered hyper-realistic detail. Emmerich and his visual effects teams pull out all the stops and theres a glorious abysmal beauty in never-ending shots of continent-wide spaceships landing and mayhem being wreaked. But for all that massy weightiness it is to the films credit that it always takes time to reassure us of the safety of a little dog.

Twenty years is quite a long wait for a second coming (curiously ""Trainspotting"" is another 1996 hit currently shooting its sequel) but the two-decade anniversary provides impetus enough to necessitate a reboot for a new generation. Indeed Emmerich and his original co-creator Dean Devlin spend much of the new films opening minutes setting up new characters and filling us in on their relationship to the old ones who themselves are sometimes literally re-awoken for the new battle. See Video Independence Day Resurgence New Trailer Takes Global Destruction to New Level Just as Bill Pullmans President Whitmore set a tone for movie presidents to come here we open with a female leader in the White House Sela Wards President Landford clearly a hint from Hollywood at where they think the race is going just as many believe Morgan Freeman playing the commander-in-chief on screen paved the way for Obama in real life. The other strikingly political/commercial giant step taken in this sequel is the inclusion of major Chinese characters such as the beautiful Angelababy who plays fighter pilot Rain whose uncle General Lao (Chin Han) is a moonbase commander. There are passages of Chinese dialogue and Chinese moon products in the bases canteen. Also Read Independence Day 2 Director Roland Emmerich Rips Marvel Movies as Silly So yes theres an awful lot of plot and backstory floating around like space junk here none of which really matters when the new invasion begins. Essentially its the same as the first movie but bigger and depending upon where you see it now in 3D. While Bill Pullman Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch return and Brent Spiners Dr Brackish comes out of a coma Will Smith is noticeably absent his character Steven Hiller mentioned as a hero but a dead one. His place -- if not his charisma nor box office clout -- is filled by Hillers son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher ""When the Game Stands Tall"") an elite pilot whos a friend of President Whitmores daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe ""It Follows"") a former flying ace who gave up her career to care for her aging father. Meanwhile shes now in love with maverick space pilot Jake (Liam Hemsworth) whos up manning space tugs on the moon. Setting all this new info up is a very complicated not to say rather dull task but Emmerich has become a master at such multi-character mashups. and he manages to cram it all in smoothly enough to then test the strength of these sketchy characters and our emotional investment in them while blowing the world to bits. Also Read Independence Day Resurgence Viral Site Reveals Will Smiths Fate Emmerichs campy gleeful global destruction is ramped up even if it couldnt really go much further. The new alien mothership is so vast -- ""three and a half thousand miles across"" exclaims someone looking up at a virtual sky -- that we cant see the whole thing on the screen which somewhat deflates its visual impact. This dark vessel exerts such a gravitational pull that whole cities are sucked up and dumped down as it passes; thus when London gets its now customary wipeout the London Eye is crushed by half of Kuala Lumpur falling on it before Dubais skyscraper spears Tower Bridge. As Goldblums David Levinson has time to observe ""They like to take out the landmarks."" In truth the movie could have done with more of this humor. Goldblum is the only character with any sense of irony and his character gets a bit sidetracked having to deal with his eccentric father Julius (Judd Hirsch) who turns up at the climax to distract the giant alien with a rather silly schoolbus loaded with kids. Goldblum does get a bit of an upscale romantic storyline too a relationship with an increasingly familiar type of character in such Hollywood mayhem usually played a classy French actress. It was Juliette Binoche in ""Godzilla"" Julie Delpy in ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" and now Charlotte Gainsbourg contributes her strangely posh yet slightly halting English delivery to the role of a psychiatrist specializing in victims of alien trauma. Its not quite Denise Richards as a nuclear physicist Bond girl but it is nevertheless odd casting. Meanwhile at the end of the world the carnage on screen is such that Emmerich feels the need to restate whats happening every five minutes with little graphics or incidental salty sea dog characters stuck on a ship monitoring alien activity ""Weve shot down her defense shield dismantled her weapons and shes going for the molten core -- youve got four minutes General.""

These silly cutaways are always my favorite moments in movies like this The shepherds in an Arabian desert tent or the African villagers crowded round the sort of short-wave radio everyone seems to have handy for just such apocalyptic occasions. (Brush off the cobwebs twiddle a knob give it a whack and boom youre patched into the Presidents private line.) While it would be foolish to say ""Independence Day Resurgence"" lacks scale and spectacle in this age of the blue-screen blockbuster scene after scene of the stuff becomes repetitive and soulless due to its victimless violence. It feels like no one ever really dies or gets hurt despite the destruction of half the planet. Again the only joke is left to Goldblum who looks up at the new enemy ship and delivers the deadpan line ""Thats definitely bigger than the last one."" Bigger yes but not nearly as much fun.

""We had 20 years to prepare... so did they"" states the tagline of ""Independence Day Resurgence"" a cheerfully ludicrous re-encounter of the third kind that doesnt show any particular evidence of all that planning. Sketchily conceived in all departments but its sensational more-is-more visual effects -- which is lets be honest where its efforts should be concentrated -- this belated cluttered sequel to the 1996 smash ""Independence Day"" breaks far less ground than its alien invaders but confirms director Roland Emmerich as modern cinemas most spirited conductor of popcorn chaos. Perhaps excessively concerned with burnishing the supposed legacy of its predecessor -- a distant memory if that for much of its target audience -- this cinematic Big Mac entertains abundantly on its own second-hand merits. While unlikely to become the pop-cultural behemoth ""ID4"" was two decades ago ""Resurgence"" should cast a sizeable shadow over its box-office competition. Nostalgia as they say is not what it used to be. When ""Independence Day"" nuked all before its path in the summer of 1996 it registered as a buffed-up sci-fi twist on the heaving heavily populated disaster spectaculars of the 1970s prompting a wave of similarly muscle-headed brink-of-doom epics in its wake -- including a couple more by Emmerich himself. In 2016 however the chief point of reference for ""Independence Day Resurgence"" is ""Independence Day"" itself even as its narrative and aesthetic (now in postmillennial 3D) provides a handy summation of the Hollywood blockbusters evolution over the last 20 years Just as the ""ID4"" influence has been detectable in everything from ""Armageddon"" to ""Pacific Rim"" so are those successors reflected in Emmerichs latest. Whether our collective memory of ""Independence Day"" is quite as treasured and detailed as ""Resurgence"" imagines it to be is another question. Its rather scattered screenplay -- written by five hands where the 1996 film managed with two -- forges a dense network of callbacks to established events and characters in certain cases via next-generation newbies. The previous films hero Will Smiths fighter pilot Steven Hiller has passed on in vague circumstances succeeded by his strapping son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher); also following a noble military path is former first daughter Patricia Whitmore (Maika Monroe replacing Mae Whitman) whose dad (a silver-bearded Bill Pullman) is addled by trauma from the attack of 1996 -- since which time steely new U.S. president Lanford (Sela Ward) dubiously informs us ""We have had no armed conflict."" ""Resurgence"" may notionally be set on planet Earth but it plainly takes place in a parallel universe. Related Roland Emmerich Hollywoods Soulful Master of Disaster Joining the new guard and seemingly assuming the lead role for further franchise entries is Liam Hemsworth as Jake a renegade pilot with all the palatable roguishness and toothy luster of ""Top Guns"" Maverick Mitchell; while hes not a blood relative of any known characters were informed that he was orphaned in the first alien attack. As the skies darken and ominous extra-terrestrial signals are received ahead of the July 4 holiday will these plucky kids kick enough alien ass to do their folks proud? Even if we had the inclination to care we hardly have the time as the writers race to cram in a surfeit of storylines many of them involving returning players. Satellite engineer David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is back on hand to spearhead the scientific investigation of the encroaching enemy as a 3000-mile-wide mothership looms over the planet. His calls for caution are overruled by the trigger-happy new POTUS -- though if ""Resurgence"" has any liberal political subtext to offer thats cancelled out by its own gleeful firearm fetish. (""This thing is way cooler than a machete"" exclaims a federal accountant-turned-fighter upon his first handling of a super-sized alien blaster.) Meanwhile eccentric scientist Brackish Okun (Brent Spiner) awakes from a 20-year coma to face the fresh wave of invaders and former President Whitmore is plagued by psychic interference from their many-tentacled near-indomitable leader. Elsewhere Levinsons father Julius (Judd Hirsch) is entrusted with ferrying a school bus of children to safety through the wreckage of the aliens first strike -- an early fiesta of flaming effects work that renders incidental the eradication of several non-American cities. (Between this and ""London Has Fallen"" the Big Smoke is having a mighty tough time of it at the movies this year.) Hardly any of these narrative strands are consistently sustained or resolved making afterthoughts of such players as Charlotte Gainsbourg (vying with recent ""Godzilla"" star Juliette Binoche for the title of Most Incongruous Thesp in a Multiplex Explosion-Fest) as an earnest psychiatrist and equivocal love interest for Goldblum and Chinese singer-actress Angelababy as an apparently renowned fighter pilot who nonetheless merits but a handful of non-onomatopoeic lines. (No prizes for guessing that women draw the scripts shortest straws As the new commander-in-chief a glamorously glowering Ward gets a fraction of the action Pullmans president did before bowing out unceremoniously.) The film may clock in just shy of two hours -- in this age of Marvel bloat a feat of relative economy on editor Adam Wolfes part -- but its amiably distracted structure makes it seem longer than the 145-minute ""Independence Day."" Related Roland Emmerich Waited to Make Independence Day Resurgence Until VFX Could Match His Vision Even if its storytelling occasionally tests patience however ""Independence Day Resurgence"" delivers swiftly and generously when it comes to the goods most viewers will have come for -- the time-honored joys of blowing stuff up in set pieces that escalate dizzyingly in size and context. Whether visualizing a swarm of fly-like fighter jets peppering a gurning alien queen with fluorescent artillery or a blazing East Asian freeway giving up its grip on gravity Emmerich has a natural showmans command of his scripts most dumbly fantastical demands; he may know no restraint but he also knows where no restraint is required of him. Landing less than a year after the well-intentioned dramatic flub of ""Stonewall"" the aptly named ""Resurgence"" is nothing if not a reminder of where his gaudy sensibility is best accommodated. Most crucially of all Emmerich has a classicists appreciation of tactility and scale Hes the DeMille of global destruction. Where many of todays superhero epics bear a plasticky digital finish that diminishes their on-screen heroism theres something genuinely boomingly imposing about ""Resurgences"" largest visual coups dreamed up by as many as nine of the industrys top effects houses typical of the films no-expense-spared immoderation. The work may be state-of-the-art but theres something in its near-tangible surfaces -- the mottled blackened underbelly of the hovering alien craft like a tar-varnished omelette or the saliva-slick scales of the visitors own skin -- that seems reassuringly non-virtual devised as easily in 1996 as in 2016. One could criticize ""Independence Day Resurgence"" for being so of a piece with its predecessor for following its template as efficiently and dutifully as it sets up a third installment  -- one that will be far less long in the making. But whether or not youre invested in the films nostalgia for itself theres something comfortingly old-school about its excesses Its the end of the world still very much as we know it.

Stephen Hauf says July 6 2016 at 509 pm Compared to the original Independence Day Film - I am very disappointed. There is total absence of plot . How the Rabbi ended up at White Sands  New Mexico driving a school bus full of abandoned pre-teen day campers while being chased by a dog like headed bi-ped/quad-ped alien boggles my mind. The comment that the ""yoda"" robot ball that was sent to advise us on how to rid our planet of nasty locust aliens is now asking us to be galactic saviors means that there may be future absurd Independence Day sequels. Reply roland dewey booker III says July 4 2016 at 119 pm Independence day 1776 was the birth of modern democracy for everyone on our planet. This installment ignored that and made it a USA-only matter. The incompetent writers producers and directors could not see past their nationalistic prejudices. The actors pronounced the word but the script was insufficient.If any money was made it was only because the first installment established its American basis.

Reply VIPIN says June 30 2016 at 1017 pm Movie is not that good. humans have advanced weapons as aliens do. only usa uk china exist according to movie. only USA has advanced warfare and others are fools according to them. they brought Chinese actress in movie completely despising other nations. movie is actually horrible. war with queen is the main action thriller part of the movie. variety wrote extreme negative for warcraft but this movie really deserve such negative reviews. a horrible  stupid movie. Reply ladylavinia1932 says June 30 2016 at 949 pm I paid the full price unfortunately. Mind you I wouldnt mind watching it again on cable or rent it through Netflix; but I would rather cut off my right hand than shell out more money to watch this film in the theaters again. By the way do Emmerich and Devlin have a thing against middle-aged women? Reply Paul says June 28 2016 at 831 pm The picture of Will Smith in the White House and having Jeff Goldblum reprise his role was already good enough for nostalgias sake but did they have to prop up Robert Loggia (Gen. William Grey) to prove their point? This movie was horrible. Thank god for 5 Tuesdays cause there is no way I coulda live with myself if I paid full price. Reply millerfilm says June 28 2016 at 903 pm Guess that Tuesday discounts must be more of a thing now I got 2.50 off my 3D screening today. It isnt great but I was glad that the film at least goes off in a direction different than the destruct-o-fest that it could have been. I think Loggia was in it because it was his final film appearance and the film is dedicated to him. Reply Will says June 27 2016 at 117 pm I really wanted to love this film. Unfortunately it fell extremely short of that goal. The scenes were scattered without logical or cinematographical cohesion; It was put together in a sort of quickly-built Frankenstein of a movie that everyone hoped would somehow miraculously spring into some kind of life. But it never did. The acting was far less impressive. I place more blame on the casting crew than on the actors themselves - they did try. Where was the mystery? The anticipation? the call to arms across the screen into the hearts of the audience?? sigh 2 out of 10? 2.5? Reply Aronwebsolutions says June 27 2016 at 436 am Roland Emmerich you did a great work in ""Independence day- resurgence"" everyone praising about the squeal of ""Independence day"". Reply nasher says June 25 2016 at 110 pm Roland Emmerich is a classicist? Hes George Pals lovechild (not that that is a bad thing). Hes stolen so many plot ideas and little bits from Pal he should be paying royalties. Im sure I will enjoy this goofy popcorn nonsense as well. Reply Shandy says June 24 2016 at 946 pm Meh. Ill probably rent it just so I can laugh about ""Gale Hawthorne in space."" And also I like Jeff Goldblum. Reply Michael says June 24 2016 at 651 am Frack all the haters. This movie was fun exciting and funny. It harkens back to the days when a summer blockbuster was uplifting and unabashedly fun instead of all the cynical dark and just plain moppy ones we get today.

Reply xerxes says June 21 2016 at 1059 pm I saw this film 5 days ago. I did not enjoy it. The chemistry comedy character tension and action from the original movie was missing in this sequel. The plot was weak also. There was no real continuity such as we hear people want to leave with the aliens but do not really see that but we see the relationship with a right wing group leader. That handshake scene was juvenile I do not recommend this film at all.

So 20th still didnt show it to critics in the U.S. Strange. Do you have any ideas as to why they decided not to show it to U.S. critics? Lenny says June 21 2016 at 706 pm Ive always thought of Emmerich and Michael Bay as the inheritors of Irwin Allens crown when it comes to ""Flashpan"" ergo Dont bother with scientific accuracy JUST GIVEEM MORE RAZZLE-DAZZLE It definately worked for him considering all the Emmys Oscars and money his shows on T.V. and theater brought in The only difference between then and now is todays effects are more sophisticated Reply millerfilm says June 21 2016 at 753 pm I think that Allen created one truly great film ""The Poseidon Adventure.""

Robert Allen says June 21 2016 at 658 pm I dont recall Independence Day very well or being very significant maybe it started the trend of movies being dumbed down for a global audience .. the movie most of us remember that changed our view of the possibilities of movies was the movie that came out that same week .. Mars Attacks THAT is a movie deserving of a sequel. Reply Unapologetic White Man says June 21 2016 at 1126 pm ""Mars Attacks"" is one of Tim Burtons many disasters.

Kyle B Kepkyley says June 21 2016 at 345 pm Were it even possible for aliens to live on another planet outside the one they evolved on which is very unlikely for the reasons pointed out in War of the Worlds they would not try to remove the current inhabitants through brute force combat.

Its good that hes not in this one. Reply BillUSA says June 21 2016 at 1246 pm Im on the lesser side of the fence about ""ID"" because it was a bit hokey even for a sci-fi film. It was crafted well but the dialogue was straight out of high-school. Okay college perhaps. What could have been a great masterpiece of impending doom and humanity putting aside its differences to prevent it was nothing more that typical Hollywood ""overdo it for the sake of overdoing it"" price-hiking. One of my cinematic regrets was that I actually paid good money to see ""ID"".....via Blockbuster. Just once before I leave this good Earth I want to see a film that enthralls me as the originals of ""War of the Worlds"" and The Day the Earth Stood Still"" did when I was just a boy. Its easy to forget after repeated viewings over decades the fright of Gort zapping away our military machinery and the Martians emerging unscathed from an atomic bomb blast like a car from a car wash. Its no anyones fault that Im pushing 60 and that I have seen over a thousand films. But it also seems that cursory (even generic) effort is put forth when it comes to alien sci-fi. In the classics I mention above each had its own message of warning about how we all dont get along. But they were subtle. Today they club you over the head with it - repeatedly - as if you were a stubborn teenager. That doesnt begin to get into how the messages of today might be accepted. Reply Kyle B Kepkyley says June 21 2016 at 341 pm Heres the problem you have to be a young boy to get enthralled the way you once did when you were a boy.

It tripped me out to because I clearly remember him dying. Apparently when the movie was originally made they added a line from the general that checks his pulse "" Hes dead."" THey took it out for whatever reason and now that they are doing the sequel he didnt actually die in the first one he went into a coma Reply James W Smith says June 21 2016 at 112 pm Like hes critical to the plot?

Reply Bob says June 21 2016 at 1153 am Why would you purposely cast Jeff Goldblum and Judd Hirsch to be in any movie? ... let alone this remake/sequel? Those two nearly ruined the first movie with their over-acting/underwhelming performances. They are literally ""nails on the chalkboard"" character actors who are so pretentiously wooden that they distract our ability to suspend our disbelief. It would have been a much better movie without them.

Never a man to shy away from a world-ending special effect - remember that tidal wave cresting Everest in 2012? - director Roland Emmerich is trying really hard to outdo himself here. So hard that he ends up painted into a corner with no recourse but to throw everything at the screen and hope that some of it sticks. So instead of the city-sized ships that terrorised Earth in the first movie there is one massive mothership more than 3000 miles across spanning the entire Atlantic ocean. And instead of an Earth resistance force led by plucky jet pilots humans have taken the alien technology and developed their own super-speed X-wing style dogfighters. And instead of a ranting dire-warning Jeff Goldblum... well he was already larger than life.Weirdly the only thing not extra-huge is the running time - and thats where the problems arise. Independence Day Resurgence is crammed with pornographic destruction and madcap action not to mention almost all the characters from the first movie (minus Will Smith) plus a heap of new ones - and its only two hours long. So its goodbye to proper character development and the slow-build tension that made the first film such a thrill and hello to exposition delivered at double speed and a cop-out ending that makes absolutely no sense. Which isnt to say Resurgence cant be a lot of fun in short bursts. Emmerichs glee is infectious as he trashes Big Ben but leaves the rebuilt White House standing and there are few things on earth cooler than Jeff Goldblum exasperatedly explaining how doomed humanity is again. But its all too much too fast and the cumulative effect is like watching a two-hour trailer - more dizzying than thrilling.

What made the first film so great was the dynamics between Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum take away the sass and heart and you are left with a predictable plot that regurgitates most of the first film and certainly nearly all invasion type flicks.
