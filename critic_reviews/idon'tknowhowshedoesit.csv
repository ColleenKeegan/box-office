Ross in ""I Do"" directed by Glenn Gaylord. Credit Gravitas Ventures ""Im just the gay uncle"" Jack keeps saying in Glenn Gaylords plodding drama ""I Do."" But is he? The movie shows one thing but insists on another.After a long windup involving lots of exposition and a little tragedy Jack (David W. Ross who also wrote the screenplay) a British man living in New York functionally becomes a surrogate father to his young niece Tara (Jessica Tyler Brown). The filmmakers take pains to show how important the relationship is to Jack and the child (a movie kid armed with from-the-mouths-of-babes apercus). And then they make Tara a problem holding Jack back from dating from living his ""own"" life -- as if these were somehow incompatible.The primary story involves Jacks need for a green card. Although he has been in the United States since he was 17 he now has visa problems. The explanation? Everythings harder since Sept. 11. In a better movie you might play along with contrived plot twists and fake obstacles but watching ""I Do"" a movie with thin characters and a languorous pace you find yourself talking back to the screen.When Jack meets a fella Mano (Maurice Compte) a sweet architect from Spain politically pointed complications ensue. Mano it turns out was born in America but even if he were to marry Jack the federal government wouldnt honor the marriage hence no green card. And then Mano is called back to Spain. Should Jack go or stay? Lead his ""own"" life or not? And whos at fault -- unenlightened government or overreaching screenwriter? I Do Director Glenn Gaylord Writer David W.

I Really Dont Care How She Does It Movies | By    Leah Rozen on September 15 2011  1108 am Email Print Oh look its rich people in beautifully appointed houses and theyre worried that the nanny might not arrive on time -- boo-boo Timing is everything. Allison Pearsons pointedly comic novel about a frazzled working mother trying to juggle home marriage and a high-pressure job in high finance in London ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" was published in 2002. One worldwide economic collapse later the movie version seems like a relic from a bygone era. Oh look its rich people in beautifully appointed houses and theyre worried that the nanny might not arrive on time for them to make important morning meetings at work. Boo-hoo. Thats being meaner than necessary about this inert film adaptation of Pearsons novel directed by Douglas McGrath (""Emma"") and written by Aline Brosh McKenna (""Morning Glory"") but watching the film one cant help feeling like youve already seen all this too many times and that a bunch of talented smart folks are just going through the motions. Even epigrammatic lines which provoked laugh-out-loud hoots when read in the book seem forced and brittle when declaimed on screen. In making the transition from page to multiplex ""I Dont Know"" has also crossed the Atlantic in its setting. The movies heroine Kate (Sarah Jessica Parker) now lives in a tasteful if toy-cluttered townhouse in Boston where she works as an investment advisor designing financial products at the Beantown branch of a Wall Street firm. Her husband (Greg Kinnear) is a journeyman architect (though hes far nicer and more successful in the film than in the book) and the couple has two small children. The plot such as it is involves Kate trying to launch a new investment fund which means struggling to keep family life on track even as she makes frequent business trips to New York. In Manhattan she regularly strategizes with an attractive and successful colleague (Pierce Brosnan) whose charms arent lost on her. The movie is trying to show the delicate balancing act that working women everywhere engage in as they try to keep job marriage family life and sanity intact and functioning. It gets certain details right -- child-inflicted food stains on ones working wardrobe passing off store-bought baked goods as homemade efforts for the school bake sale that motherhood means making endless to-do lists etc. But dont we see that every night of the week already on smart TV sitcoms like ""Modern Family"" and even reruns of ""Roseanne""? The film also unnecessarily regularly trots out a jarring storytelling device having friends and colleagues talk directly to the camera about Kate. Its as if they were in a reality show or a documentary. It doesnt help that one pal (Christina Hendricks) is positioned in front of what appears to be a bookcase filled with legal volumes; initially it seems as if she might be testifying in a deposition for a legal action involving Kate. None of the major performers embarrass themselves here but neither does anyone especially shine. Parker seems more strident and flailing than necessary Kinnear floats through as if bemused that this is what his career has come to and the always reliable Brosnan lets the edges of his eyes crinkle in detached amusement. One wonders if a more accurate title would be ""I Dont Know and I Dont Really Care How She Does It."" Breaking News To Your Inbox. Sign up >> http//twitter.com/share?text=Review Sarah Jessica Parker?

Craig Blankenhorn/The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Craig Blankenhorn/The Weinstein Company I Dont Know How She Does It Director Douglas McGrath Genre Comedy Running Time 91 minutes Rated PG-13 for sexual references throughout Almost a decade ago British journalist Allison Pearson published a comic novel about the trials of an overcommitted hedge fund manager trying to juggle family and career. As chick lit goes I Dont Know How She Does It was warm witty and endearingly self-amused if only peripherally aware of the fact that there are worse problems than having it all. The book became a best-seller in every country where women earn enough to suffer such dilemmas. Oprah gave her blessing. (""The working mothers Bible"") Movie rights were quickly secured. Ten years later it says something about the elusive state of bliss known as work-life balance that the trials of the overextended working mother remain a mommy-blog evergreen and that Pearsons novel remains a property hot enough to merit a movie. Or it would be had director Douglas McGrath and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna not made such a hash of translating the English page to the American screen. I Dont Know How She Does It is a lazy mess made worse by bad choices beginning with its lead. Sarah Jessica Parkers specialty role -- the kittenish child-woman dressed like an oversexed 10-year-old -- pretty much exhausted its charm as far back as L.A. Story in which she played Steve Martins high-colonic-addicted date and the actress has grown steadily more annoying as Carrie Bradshaw coyly simpering at Mr. Big in the Sex and the City franchise. In I Dont Know How She Does It the actress is downright improbable as the confident Boston fund manager Kate Reddy happily married and mother of two adorable tykes. (Caring for the latter during Kates many work trips is the worlds most reliable and tactful nanny.) Yes Kate is living the new American dream yet all is not well in her universe. An all-round multitasker and incipient basket case she lies awake in the wee hours making lists of unfinished business ""from Kegels to bagels."" At work she turns cartwheels crafting brilliant yet ethically pure deals for her clients while trying to manage her guilt about not being ""there"" for her family. Hamming wildly Parker renders Kate as a hand-flapping incompetent rather than a mature adult with too much to do. It doesnt help that shes flanked by two smart performers either of whom would have made a Kate far less colorlessly vapid than Parkers. i A criminally underused Christina Hendricks (right) plays Kates best mate. Craig Blankenhorn/The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Craig Blankenhorn/The Weinstein Company A criminally underused Christina Hendricks (right) plays Kates best mate. Craig Blankenhorn/The Weinstein Company As her best friend Mad Mens Christina Hendricks has little to do but declaim womens issues to the camera. (McGrath opts for the overused mockumentary frame complete with freeze frames and subtitles.) Meanwhile Olivia Munn extracts maximum mileage from a faintly distasteful moue as Kates junior colleague -- no bunny-boiler she but still a go-getting workaholic who thinks she hates children. A swift turnaround is to be expected in a movie as placative as this one but not before Munn steals the show looking down her nose at the dab of cereal on Kates lapel. Time and again the movie sidles up to the big-ticket issue at its heart -- the awkward spot where the gains of feminism rub up against the desire for love and family -- then backs away without a serious scratch. Every now and then the dialogue genuflects weakly in the general direction of the womens movement. ""The market doesnt know what sex I am"" Kate observes brightly while batting her eyelids at Jack (a very good Pierce Brosnan) the suave widower with whom she cuts flashy deals in New York. ""It only knows if Im right or wrong."" Yet no amount of standing up to the boss (Kelsey Grammer) demanding equal chores from her quiescent hubby (Greg Kinnear) or cutaways to Rosalind Russell duking it out with Cary Grant in His Girl Friday can hide the fact that the enemy here is not men. With one exception -- Seth Meyers in a disposable role as Kates smug rival for the plum contracts -- the guys are all malleable softies in gym-rat clothing. No in the chick-flick world hell is other women and here specifically its the stay-at-home wife and mother. Like so many of its genre this movie snickers long and loud at non-working mothers represented by Kates passive-aggressive mother-in-law (Jane Curtin) and a blond harridan (astutely played by Busy Philipps) spitting pious venom from the StairMaster or scoffing at Kates store-bought contribution to the school bake sale. In Bridget Jones Diary such women were dismissed (until Bridget became one) as ""Smug Marrieds""; here theyre disparaged as ""Momsters."" In my experience self-righteousness is fairly evenly distributed between mothers who work and those who dont and career girls by no means have a monopoly on sisterly solidarity. From where I sit we working mothers should be grateful to stay-at-home moms who work their unpaid tails off raising funds for school arts programs and who when called upon by women working late for emergency child pickups quietly say ""No problem take your time she can eat with us."" Compared with them and to the growing army of mothers who work and raise their kids on a shoestring or less Kate Reddy lives a royal fairy tale.

PG-13. 1 hour 31 minutes. At area theaters. An amiable cast can be a wise investment. Take the slight comedy ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" based on the novel by Allison Pearson. Romantic-comedy vets Sarah Jessica Parker Greg Kinnear and Pierce Brosnan provide enough humane and tempered moments to mitigate the more obvious shtick in this contemporary parable about balancing the challenges and pleasures of being a mom with those of being awfully good at your job about weathering disappointments and managing expectations -- yours and everyone elses. Kate Reddy (Parker) has two children a loving husband (Kinnear) and a job as a investment-fund manager at a clubby Boston firm. She writes spot-on reports but cant schmooze at strip clubs with clients the way some of her male peers do. When shes not returning from a business trip or consulting her BlackBerry she stays up in the wee hours fake-baking a pie for a school bake sale. Recipe Place one store- bought dessert in a Pyrex plate. Add powdered sugar. Hope you drop it off before the Martha Stewart acolytes arrive with the real deal. Kates heart is in the right two places. But time is not on her side. Neither is her boss Clark (Kelsey Grammer) or colleague Chris Bunce. Seth Meyers portrays Kates office counterpart emphasis on counter. Wholly in her corner if tiring of Kates schedule is husband Richard. He too is trying to make his professional mark. The movie -- written by Aline Brosh McKenna -- offers each their big break at the same time. Thankfully ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" isnt about whose career is more important. Its about having it all. Because Kate really does want to be the miracle worker of the movies title she promises to make everyone happy by making everything work. Jane Curtin portrays Kates pinched mother-in-law who likely came of parenting age in the 60s but sounds ensconced in 1950s rules of the domestic division of labor. So much simpler she says. Brosnan brings his customary ease to Jack Abelhammer (we know ridiculous name). Hes the guy who hires Kate because he believes she has a proposal worth exploring. The movie lets the question ""Can men and women work this closely together or be friends?"" hang over their interactions. ""Sex and the City"" proved Parker has a voice that works well for instant revelation. Here her occasional voice-over insights arent the only instance of sharing. Looking into the camera Kates chilly assistant Momo (a deadpan Olivia Munn) co-worker Bunce condescending ""momster"" Wendy (Busy Philipps) as well as Kates best friend Allison (Christina Hendricks) provide plenty of babble- of-the-sexes theories.

I Dont Know How She Does It reviewed Sarah Jessica Parker rides the rapids of upper-middle-class parenthood. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 16 2011 110 PM I Dont Know How She Does It Sarah Jessica Parker rides the rapids of upper-middle-class parenthood. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate A Slate writer witnesses a strange Sarah Jessica Parker moment following a screening of the movie. I Dont Know How She Does It Every so often I wish I could send the psychoanalytic theorist D.W. Winnicott a fruit basket for having invented the concept of ""the good-enough mother."" Though Winnicotts mid-20th-century coinage of the term long preceded the current era of aspirational parenting (and though some of his ideas about gender roles now read as painfully dated) his generous vision of what constitutes adequate mothering comes as welcome salve on high-stress days (that is to say the ones that end in a ""y""). Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) the heroine of Douglas McGraths I Dont Know How She Does It (The Weinstein Co.) needs to read herself some Winnicott. A successful investment analyst at a Boston firm shes also mother to two young children and wife to an equally ambitious architect (Greg Kinnear) whos well-intentioned but fuzzy on the details of how his family operates. Type-A Kate insists on singlehandedly hostessing elaborate birthday parties participating in school bake sales (with store-bought pies that she distresses to make them look homemade) and otherwise excelling at the rituals of upper-middle-class parenthood. Meanwhile at work Kate is on the brink of landing a career-making account that requires her to work closely with a dashing British banker (Pierce Brosnan) and to travel on a moments notice. Advertisement In a Sex and the City-like device various characters address the camera to give voice to their ongoing ignorance of how in fact she does it. Theres Kates single-mother pal Allison (an underused but radiant Christina Hendricks) her robotically efficient executive assistant (a scene-stealing Olivia Munn) and an undermining stay-at-home mom at her childrens school (the ever-delightful Busy Philipps). All of these women no doubt have their own struggles and triumphs but we never learn what they are. Like Carrie Bradshaw Parkers dithering Sex and the City protagonist Kate has a way of taking up all the air in the room and getting applauded for it. Seriously has it occurred to this woman that shes losing credibility at work not because shes a mother but because shes a chronic over-apologizer with a persecution complex? The screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna ( The Devil Wears Prada 27 Dresses) adapted Allison Pearsons 2002 novel of the same name which was set in London with a wryer brasher tone and a more flawed protagonist. The Kate of the book carried on a titillating e-mail flirtation with her colleague nearly ending her marriage in the process; the stakes in the glossier movie version are comfortably low. The parenting lapses Kate wrings her hands over--as when the nanny takes her son in for his first haircut without her--may evoke mutters of ""Cry me a river lady"" from recession-era audiences. In both content and tone I Dont Know How She Does It feels like a relic from the Sex and the City boom times. If there were even a passing nod to economic reality--for example an acknowledgement that not all stay-at-home mothers are pampered trophy wives who live at the gym--this self-satisfied domestic comedy might not leave behind such a tinny taste. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In an unintentionally disturbing subplot Kates assistant Momo a single career-focused woman in her mid-20s whos sworn never to have children accidentally finds herself pregnant. After Momo mumbles her intention to ""take care of it"" Kate clasps her by the shoulders and eyes glassy with maternal zeal essentially bullies her into having the baby. Not that I expect a character in a mainstream Hollywood movie to seriously consider let alone go through with an abortion--that would probably require a Supreme Court injunction at this point--but the movies unquestioning embrace of Kates pro-life proselytization felt somehow creepy. Couldnt they at least have a conversation? (In the book a much older character Kates best friend Candy finally decides to continue with an unplanned pregnancy after the two friends engage in a frankly ambivalent discussion ""Im getting rid of it."" ""Fine."" ""What?"" ""Nothing."") I Dont Know How She Does It purports to be about the difficult choices of modern motherhood but its too prim and cautious a movie to dip a pedicured toe into the murky waters of real choice.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 16 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The frazzled dazzle of Sex and the City star Sarah Jessica Parker as ""juggler"" Kate Reddy - a fortysomething woman balancing a career in financial management with motherhood and marriage to a recently downsized architect - is not enough to save I Dont Know How She Does It from fizzling out almost before it begins. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" starring Sarah Jessica Parker Movies I Dont Know How She Does It The official trailer Director Douglas McGrath who has written and directed literary adaptations including Emma Nicholas Nickleby and Infamous (and was co-writer on Woody Allens Bullets Over Broadway) delivers a good-looking briskly paced domestic comedy but he puts aside his pen for this one. Instead Aline Brosh McKenna ( The Devil Wears Prada) has adapted columnist Allison Pearsons bestselling 2002 novel for the screen keeping the extremely thin plot focused but relying heavily on familiar TV devices. The voice-over narration from Kate is not nearly as illuminating or as humorous as the insights from Parkers character Carrie in Sex and the City. And the documentary-style interviews with supporting characters so popular on one-camera sitcoms offer viewers absolutely nothing of added value - with the standout exception of Olivia Munn ( The Daily Show) who plays Kates attractive smart and robotically efficient assistant and pretty near steals the show. Aside from its spoon-feeding the audience an abundance of cliches the main problem is that this Boston-set flick quite unselfconsciously presents itself as if it were a pop-culture first to express ideas about the working-mom balancing act. And the movies mean streak - Busy Philipps as a kind of superior ""Housewives of Boston"" mom and SNLs Seth Meyers as an annoyingly competitive co-worker - really dont provide a serious threat to Kates future as a mom and worker. All this will likely not go down well with the millions of smart working moms not to mention Parker fans who the producers expect will want to see this movie. In the end there is forward momentum but zero tension here. Kate lands a potentially career-boosting opportunity to develop a major new account and must make frequent trips to New York where she works closely with the dashing Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan). Back at home her unfailingly understanding husband (Greg Kinnear likeable as always but not given much to work with) just wants a few minutes of grown-up time with his wife. When Kate has to leave a Thanksgiving family trip to meet an important deadline its positioned as a potential crisis point. But I Dont Know How She Does It is both too much and not enough like real life for that. Its a going-through-the-motions domestic comedy that makes say Cheaper By The Dozen look like a heart-warming cutting-edge laugh riot.

(Craig Blankenhorn/Weinstein Co.) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 16 2011 400 AM Title I Dont Know How She Does It With Sarah Jessica Parker Pierce Brosnan.  Romantic comedy about a stressed-out working mother. Director Douglas McGrath (135). PG-13 Language mild sexuality. At area theaters.If anyone out there is desperate for another ""Sex and the City"" sequel (anyone?) fear not In ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" Carrie Bradshaw finally settles down and raises a family.Well not technically.Sarah Jessica Parker is actually playing a character named Kate Reddy who originated in a best-selling novel by Allison Pearson. But from the wry narration to the girlish mannerisms Parker really does turn this film into ""Sex and the Kiddies.""On the bright side its a lot more watchable than its awful trailer indicates. Director Douglas McGrath (""Emma"") and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada"") are both pros with a crucial sense of empathy toward their hapless heroine.A mother of two Kate is an investment manager whose demanding job perpetually requires impossible decisions Does she please her husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) or her bosses Clark (Kelsey Grammer) and Jack (Pierce Brosnan)? Can she buy a deli pie for her daughters bake sale or does she have to make one from scratch?While Olivia Munn Christina Hendricks and Jane Curtin nail their roles as Kates assistant best friend and disapproving mother-in-law the male actors - including Seth Meyers as her competitor - are afterthoughts. Only the always-reliable Brosnan finds some depth in his underwritten role.Then again this is very much Kates story and much to their credit the filmmakers refuse to judge any of her choices.They do wrap things up with superficial ease but they also find plenty of humor and poignancy in parenthood.At the same time they never shy away from the worry guilt and criticisms so many working mothers experience. (If anything theyre too hard on stay-at-home moms as represented by a vapid Busy Philipps.)Unfortunately Parker infuses Kate - a nonstop mess whos constantly apologizing - with such frantic insecurity that she comes across more as an anxious twentysomething than a 40-year-old mother. Its Hendricks who provides the welcome maturity and I couldnt help wishing she had been given the lead.But as Richard reminds his harried wife ""Sometimes okay has to be good enough.""Magic Moment Any parent whos ever sung a lullaby over the phone will connect when Kate serenades her daughter with ""A Bushel and a Peck.""

You could make a fine film about juggling mommy hood and the job -- from the UrbanBaby.com message boards. That would have to be a horror flick about womans cruelty to woman though. ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" is by contrast a meager one-joke comedy peopled by stereotypes. Sarah Jessica Parker plays Kate a harried Boston banker who spends the entire movie warming up leftover working-mom gags. Here she is getting into a corporate elevator full of suits with a dozen kids party balloons. During a PowerPoint presentation a sonogram of a fetus shows up. In a business meeting she has ""bouncy house"" written in marker on her palm. Etc. etc. et-freaking-cetera. The ""it"" of the title is juggling (cue in the closing seconds an amazingly self-satisfied line about her occupation being ""juggler"") but Kate is the kind of ditz who could get lost in a bathtub. Why does she wait until a video conference is starting to adjust her tights? Why doesnt she ask her nanny to make a pie she needs for the school bake sale? Why does she suddenly start babbling on a crowded elevator that ""I make a great turkey . . . my breast is very juicy""? Why must she freak out over everything? Give this lady half a Valium and spare us. PHOTOS I DONT KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT FILMING IN NY The movies lowly ambition is to be ""The Devil Wears Gerber"" or maybe ""Sex and the Citibank"" but its got a retro soul. (Some lines about men who refuse to help with the housework would have fit right into an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" a show that wasnt even funny at the time.) And its real subject is narcissism. Kate who has two darling kids and a cool understanding husband (Greg Kinnear) imagines everyone is talking about her uninteresting dilemmas all the time. The perfect blond stay-at-home mothers or ""Momsters"" she imagines are judging her behind her back (why does she care?) while her best friend Allison (Christina Hendricks of ""Mad Men"") rushes to the defense. All of these people issue their cliches directly to the camera in what director Douglas McGrath imagines to be a flourish of immediacy. But this affectation (and the usage of animated graphics illustrating whats going on in Kates cluttered mind) is merely an effortful way to make all the whining seem fun. Everyone in the audience has to juggle a job and a personal life too so what makes Kates chatter about food stains on her clothes interesting? Do we really need to hear again that men cant be bothered to pick up some toilet paper? Women once were confined to housewifery. They were apparently unhappy about this. Then they were limited to low-status low-stress ""mommy track"" jobs and were unhappy about this. Now they hold high-paying highly stressful jobs are expected to behave as men and are unhappy about this too. You could make an Ingmar Bergman miniseries about female unhappiness but it isnt new. A tumbril remark (""Let them eat cake"" being the most famous) is one that makes the peasants think about rounding up the aristos and polishing the guillotines. This is a tumbril movie even before the cringe-inducing Margaret Mead scene in which Kate and an even richer banker (Pierce Brosnan) delightedly discover the existence of bowling proletarians and drink Bud longnecks instead of their usual martinis. Yes Kate has a busy life. She works long hours is tethered to her BlackBerry and is forced to travel on short notice. But shes a banker in the land of the unemployed. The movie is annoyingly coy about the other side of this particular teeter-totter which is a giant bag of money with dollar signs all over it. Kates kitchen is big enough to host a polo match. Her nanny is there for her all day. She had to miss her sons first haircut? Lets see her net worth. Kates buddy Allison issues facile man-hating truisms such as one about how a man who leaves his job to take care of his kid is considered adorable while a woman who does so is called disorganized. Such Womans Day-level insights dont constitute a movie which is why in an effort to provide something resembling a plot the movie gins up a flirtation between Kate and Brosnans charming widower. (Cant rom-coms ever imagine a guy whose wife died could still be a total jackass?) It then doesnt know what to do with this idea because it doesnt want its lead to be judged by all the mommies out there. The good news about ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" is that its so bad that its another ovary-punch to the formula chick flick.

Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Greg Kinnear Pierce Brosnan Olivia Munn Seth Meyers Kelsey Grammer Christina Hendricks Jane Curtin Director Douglas McGrath Running time 135 Release Opened Sep 16 2011  Editorial Review A working mother in a sitcom worldBy Michael OSullivanFriday Sep 16 2011As reported in Entertainment Weekly actress Christina Applegate - who plays a harried working mother in the new sitcom ""Up All Night"" - made the producers swear off one of Hollywoods most excruciating parenting cliches spit-up on her blouse. I mention this only because it would have been nice if Sarah Jessica Parker - who plays Kate a harried working mother in the insipid unfunny and cliche-ridden ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" - had held the filmmakers to a similar standard. Okay maybe not exactly nice. The film is so bad its hard to imagine anything saving it. But it might at least have been slightly less torturous to sit through. Along with the offending spit-up-on-the-blouse joke (translated to pancake batter in screenwriter Aline Brosh McKennas adaptation of Allison Pearsons chick-lit bestseller) ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" strip-mines every last nugget from the mother lode of maternal movie comedy including gags about head lice bake-sale envy and morning sickness. That last one comes courtesy of Kates assistant (Olivia Munn) who gets pregnant halfway through the film and spends the rest of the time retching. Always good for a laugh. If youre a sitcom circa 1975. Come to think of it the movie which clocks in at a scant hour and a half contains about as much actual material as a half-hour TV show. The balance of the story which concerns Kates efforts to juggle job mothering and marriage (to Greg Kinnears mortified-looking husband) in the midst of a high-stakes work assignment involving a hunky Pierce Brosnan is padding. Director Doug McGrath - who shockingly enough made the well-received 2006 Truman Capote biopic ""Infamous"" - over-stuffs the movie with gimmicks. Take out the loopy narration intrusive on-screen pop-up text time-wasting montages and faux documentary-style interviews with such supporting characters as Kates babysitter (Jessica Szohr) her overachieving rival in the Mom Olympics (Busy Philipps) and a competitive work colleague (Seth Meyers) and youve got very little left. Speaking of Meyers any movie that makes the ""Weekend Update"" funnyman not just dull but also annoying is doing something wrong. As it turns out its doing a lot of things wrong. In addition to across-the-board lame acting ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" boasts a bizarre worldview that seems to simultaneously sympathize with the working mother - or at least to the caricature of one - and to demonize her. At one point toward the end of the film Parkers Kate opines in voice-over that ""trying to be a man is a waste of a woman"" as though there were something inherently unfeminine about working outside the home. Its not a sitcom circa 1975 after all but circa 1955. Contains some vulgar language and sexy talk.

The Weinstein Company Sarah Jessica Parker and Greg Kinnear in ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" (The Weinstein Company) The mildly funny ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" will strike a few familiar notes with working mothers the never-finished to-do lists the pressures of school bake sales the mysterious food stains on business suits. But the world of Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) while hectic and overloaded is still too good to be true.Kate is a fund manager who lands a big account that requires her to work long hours and travel frequently. At the same time her architect husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) gets his dream job. The couple try to juggle work and raising their two children but they grow frustrated and their stress levels rise.Kate also finds herself spending a lot of time working with the dashing Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) another source of friction for Kate and Richard. While Brosnan and Kinnear are appealing in their roles they are too understanding too perfect to be believable. On the flip side the other people in Kates life are cartoonish stereotypes. The biggest offender is stay-at-home mom Wendy Best (Busy Phillips) who bakes cookies and goes to the gym while her kids are at school. (Sure thats what stay-at-home moms do.) Then theres the sexist colleague (Seth Meyers); the cold childless assistant (Olivia Munn who delivers the most laughs); the disapproving mother-in-law (Jane Curtain); and the sassy single mom (""Mad Mens"" Christina Hendricks).The film based on a 2002 novel by Allison Pearson doesnt provide a fully drawn picture of the challenges of working parents. Director Douglas McGrath spends too much time on the dull love triangle and on long adoring shots of Parker. But it does give working mothers a chance to see a bit of their lives onscreen and laugh about it. Like its main character ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" tries to do everything but it doesnt quite succeed.

Juggling the demands of the children husbands and jobs competing for your attention must be complicated. Fortunately there are movies like I Dont Know How She Does It to boil it down to a few simplistic observations and dumb platitudes. Any working mother is bound to see herself in this. Provided she is also a fictional character on a sitcom that is. For example Claire Huxtable might watch this and think ""Oh yes this is my life exactly"" Real people probably will not relate quite as closely. Based on Allison Pearsons best-selling book and adapted by Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada 27 Dresses) it examines modern motherhood in such a superficially generic way that youd swear the movie thinks no one has ever brought up the subject before. Hey did you know that when you have a stressful job and a couple young children youll often be too tired for sex? And that sometimes theres a splotch of pancake batter on your blouse? And that its hard to schedule business meetings so they dont conflict with your kids school events? All of these things are true Its about time a movie had the insight to make such astute observations Sarah Jessica Parker sticking close to her Sex and the City roots plays Kate Reddy an allegedly frumpy but still obviously very stylish woman whose job as an investment banker has her traveling frequently. She narrates the film for us Carrie Bradshaw-style letting us know how much she misses her 6-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son when shes away not to mention her supportive and long-suffering husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) whos like an architect or something. (It doesnt matter.) Shes grateful for the competent nanny Paula (Jessica Szohr) but wishes she could be home more to spend time with the kids herself. But hey -- those investments arent going to invest themselves Kates narration also allows her to give us the inside scoop on her friends and co-workers without the movie having to you know SHOW us what theyre like. The process is reduced to a series of painfully bland one-liners. For example her assistant Momo (Olivia Munn) ""has the work ethic of a robot -- and the warmth"" One of the judgmental gym-going ""supermoms"" she knows ""is in better shape than a Navy SEAL -- tougher too"" Kates best friend Allison (Christina Hendricks) a single mom whose alleged child is never seen gets in on the act with this ""The inside of a working womans head is like the control tower at OHare Airport"" Thats as funny as it gets folks. It gets no funnier. Kates frantic lifestyle threatens to overwhelm her when she lands an assignment with suave colleague Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) and must spend many nights and weekends working on a presentation to take to an investor. (Or something. The movie is as unclear on the details of high finance as it is on parenthood.) Once again rather than being insightful or clever the movie reduces everything to a series of contrivances like the investor only being able to meet on the day after Thanksgiving which is when Kate promised her daughter theyd build a snowman. The movie periodically cuts to one of Kates acquaintances giving testimonials like reality-show contestants. Mostly they express their amazement over her ability to handle it all with variations of ""I dont know how she does it"" repeated constantly. Her enemies like a supermom played by Busy Philipps and a smarmy co-worker played by Seth Meyers make passive-aggressive remarks. So does her mother-in-law played by Jane Curtin whos as underused and wasted in this as Philipps Meyers and Hendricks. Allison the best friend makes one observation that struck me as relevant. She says that when a man leaves work to spend time with his sick child hes a hero a caring dad. When a woman does it shes a slacker whos not committed to her job. That rings true. Honestly most of the double standards the movie brings up sound like theyre probably pretty accurate. The thing is theyre also obvious and the movie (which was directed by Douglas McGrath who made Emma) doesnt present them with any wit or originality. Its all ""men never notice when were out of toilet paper"" and ""oh no my daughter got head lice at school and now my scalp is itchy during this business meeting"" and similar wakka-wakka nonsense. All thats missing is the braying laugh track.

With the leap over the pond many of the novels distinctly British witticisms have fallen by the wayside. Whats left is formulaic fluff about a harried mother/ambitious hedge-fund manager who tries to reconcile these dissonant worlds. Hilarity does not ensue.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Kate a financial whiz who is also the mother of two children and the wife of Richard (Greg Kinnear) an easygoing architect with the patience of Job.As Kate Parker alternates between Carrie Bradshaws perky flightiness and a super-frazzled Erma Bombeck. When co-worker Momo (Olivia Munn) points out a bit of dried food on the lapel of Kates jacket she promptly takes a nibble and proclaims ""Pancake batter""Most working moms know that balancing careers and children is complicated at best and crazy-making at worst.

That may give you some sense of this highly stylized often beautiful and graphically violent action drama about a mechanic and part-time movie stunt driver who moonlights as a wheelman. It will be an incomplete sense though. Depending on the second-by-second circumstances The Driver might also be called The Lover Dreamer Benefactor Brute or Killer--hes actually all of those things in the time and space of a single elevator ride. Few actors working today could make emotional sense of such a protean character but Ryan Gosling does so with calm authority. Hes a formidable presence in a film that grabs your gaze and wont let go except for moments when you cant help but look away. ENLARGE Top Ryan Gosling as The Driver in Drive. FilmDistrict ""Drive"" was directed by Nicolas Winding Refn from Hossein Aminis adaptation of a noirish novel by James Sallis. Mr. Refn born in Denmark but a New Yorker since childhood brought a Continental flair to several violent features starting with the 1996 ""Pusher"" that have earned him a cult following. (In ""Drive"" a pitiless thug claims to have produced sexy action movies in the 1980s ""One critic"" he says dryly ""called them European."") This penchant for suspenseful mayhem gives pace and shape to a story that otherwise wouldnt be much more than a tone poem. After befriending Irene (Carey Mulligan) a neighbor whose husband is in prison The Driver finds himself in an awkward position when the husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) is released and comes home. Then his impulsive generosity puts him in a perilous position vis-a-vis ruthless crooks who are using him in ways he cant comprehend. Watch a clip from the film ""Drive"" starring Ryan Gosling. Video courtesy of FilmDistrict. That peril like the action flowing from it is intense--a hold-up gone bad; car chases through the streets of Los Angeles; car combat that involves some spectacular driving in reverse; car characterization that puts the way-cool hero into an unassuming Chevy Impala with 300 horses hidden under the hood or later a spirited stolen Mustang and the bad guys into a massive hunch-shouldered Chrysler 300 sedan. I wont describe the mayhem in detail because I dont want you looking away from the page. The tone-poem parts are pretty wonderful too thanks to Newton Thomas Sigels cinematography which is gorgeous even when the camera is only surveying flat surfaces; to the sound track which ranges from ecstatic harmonies to overmodulations that sound like a cars harsh exhaust note and to the directors fondness for enchanted attenuated encounters as in the moments which go from slo-mo to no-mo when The Driver and Irene first meet. ""Drive"" matches the nakedly brutal (an explosion of violence in a nightclub that evokes Weimar decadence) with the scruffily lyrical (The Driver taking Irene and her sweetly soulful young son Benicio--hes played by Kaden Leos--for a drive down the barely moist cement channel of the Los Angeles River.) Most of the supporting performances are flawless. Ms. Mulligan gives Irene an air of bittersweet expectancy; youre not sure because Irene isnt sure whether shes awaiting pleasure or pain. Mr. Isaac uses the astutely written specifics of the husbands role to make him likable as well as memorable. Christina Hendrickss Blanche is so much a moll that she should have been called The Moll. As the thug who once produced movies Albert Brooks is both the essence of simplicity and evil incarnate; its a small but sensational performance. Ron Perlman by contrast is intrusively grotesque as another murderous monster though the way hes photographed suggests that its not his fault. The director unduly taken by his actors singular physiognomy may have allowed or encouraged the excess. Then theres Mr. Gosling and the ongoing mystery of how he manages to have so much impact with so little apparent effort. Its irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando; like Brando he has a surprisingly light even boyish voice that can seem to be escaping his throat rather than being sent forth from it. But peerless though Brando was he could be mannered to the point of self-parody. That hasnt happened to Mr. Gosling. He keeps it fresh whether its the droll self-assurance of his womanizer in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" or the doomily seductive inwardness of The Driver in ""Drive."" He and this powerful film which is ultimately about a moment of grace deserve each other. Hes the mediums most graceful minimalist. Happy Happy In her casually daring--and mostly endearing--debut feature the Norwegian director Anne Sewitsky mixes and purposely mismatches light and dark moods to tell the story of a rural wife and mother looking for happiness in the wrong places and finally in the right one. (The film which was written by Ragnhild Tronvoll is Norways foreign-language entry in this years Academy Awards.) Kaja whos vulnerable in ways we can only intuit at first is played with unsettling good cheer by Agnes Kittelsen. Shes the picture of domestic contentment as well as generous hospitality when a couple of urban sophisticates Sigve and Elisabeth and their adopted Ethiopian son Noa move into the house next to hers. (Theyre played by Henrik Rafaelsen Maibritt Saerens and Ram Shihab Ebedy. Joachim Rafaelsen--no relation--is Eirik Kajas prickly husband.) Soon enough though the mood darkens the sexual plot thickens and both women start to reveal the separate but equal sadness that swirls beneath the surface of their lives. ENLARGE Agnes Kittelsen as Kaja in Happy Happy. Magnolia Pictures ""Happy Happy"" wont make you happy if you hold to the notion that a movie can be funny or serious but not both. And particularly not both at the same time as in several eerie scenes that find Kajas and Eiriks young son Theodor playing master and slave with Noa. Yet those scenes furnish fair comment on other kinds of enslavement--to the idealized notion of family to the desperate need for love--that has kept Kaja from the happiness she has always craved. Perhaps another comment is too obviously on the nose when Kaja a timid soloist with a local church choir gets to sing ""Amazing Grace"" with those familiar lines ""I once was lost but now am found."" Still more comment is dispensed sporadically and amusingly by a gospel quartet with an amazing bass and even by President Barack Obama who watched by Noa on a notebook computer says it may come as no surprise given the ""dizzying pace of globalization"" that ""people fear the loss of what they cherish."" The movie doesnt need all that explication though it doesnt really get in the way. Kaja explains herself eloquently in the course of discovering herself. I Dont Know How She Does It A stressogenic comedy about stress this screen version of Allison Pearsons debut novel stars Sarah Jessica Parker as Kate Reddy a superachiever struggling to juggle the demands of motherhood and career. Her juggling act excludes surprises; every ball plate and dumbbell comes down exactly where you expect it to. And every scene is clearly labeled in Aline Brosh McKennas screenplay which resembles nothing so much as a PowerPoint presentation--this means this that means that--with bullet points emphasized by on-camera interviews of the heroines friends and associates. (The two men in her life earnest husband and cautiously amorous business partner are played by Greg Kinnear and Pierce Brosnan.) ENLARGE Sarah Jessica Parker as Kate in I Dont Know How She Does It. The Weinstein Company Does Kates insane striving both as a mother and financial analyst reflect the contemporary lives of real people? It does indeed. On a long flight last weekend I watched a scarily earnest mother use one of those your-baby-can-read books to teach vocabulary words to her six-month-old daughter who stared at the pages in total bafflement. And the inside of a working womans head may well be as one of Kates friends says like the control tower at OHare airport. (The friend who says it--Christina Hendricks in perky mode-- has no useful role in the action; shes just there for clever comments.) But the movie which was directed by Douglas McGrath establishes Kates basic--and by now banal--conflict early on then never stops for a moments reflection as distinct from explanation. Long after lice from her childrens school infested Kates scalp I was scratching my head about why a 91-minute movie seemed so long. The answer came from reframing the question. Why was a string of sitcom problems stretched to 91 minutes? DVD FOCUS They Drive by Night (1940) ENLARGE Raoul Walshs film is really two films uncomfortably combined as everyone has noted since its release seven decades ago. One half with George Raft Humphrey Bogart and Alan Hale is about independent truck drivers trying to make an honest living. The other with its standard-brand melodramatics is dominated by Ida Lupinos going-mad scene in a courtroom. Not to be confused with Nicholas Rays vastly superior 1948 feature ""They Live By Night"" which was adapted from an Edward Anderson novel that was also the progenitor of Robert Altmans marvelous and grievously underappreciated 1974 film ""Thieves Like Us."" OHorten (2007) An early scene in Bent Hamers humane comedy in Norwegian with English subtitles depicts the power that the taciturn hero enjoys and will soon be forced to surrender. An engineer who must soon retire Odd Horten sits serene at the controls of a sleek locomotive pulling a passenger train from Oslo to Bergen through a silent snowscape. The literal subject is retirement and the prospect of loss. But Mr. Hamer a poet of the droll and askew sends the aptly named Odd on a cockeyed journey from regret through comic confusion to a lovely eagerness for new adventures. Emma (1996) During a cheerful interlude of lawn archery in Douglas McGraths screen version of Jane Austens comic tour de force one of the heroines arrows lands in the grass below a big overstuffed target. If the arrow is emblematic of Emmas penchant for missing the point in human affairs its also the only thing that falls significantly short of the mark in this deftly understated production with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role. An American actress and an American director in his feature debut have made a Jane Austen movie that outshines its predecessors by not trying to shine at all.

Technically the lists are in her head but director Doug McGraths I Dont Know How She Does It features onscreen graphics documentary-style interviews and other tricks that break the fourth wall. At times Kate steps out of the action to provide context for the audience. The movie is a Chatty Cathy eager to share. But never to overshare -- this is a civilized ladylike comedy. Kate puts ""Kegels?"" on the list then quickly replaces it with ""bagels"" which are unquestionably more vital to keeping her household running smoothly. Kate is Carrie Bradshaw stripped bare of her bachelors even. She has an architect husband Richard (Greg Kinnear) who is more beta than Big a kindergartener daughter and a toddler son whose first words are ""Bye-bye Mama."" ""Thatll come in handy"" snipes Kates disapproving mother-in-law (Jane Curtin) referring to the frequent business trips that are part of Kates high-powered job at a financial firm. Carrie and Kate arent all that different -- they both spend a lot of time worrying for one thing -- except that Kates closet is full of black white and grey prints not tutus and her landscape of anxiety includes dependents and lice not STDs. Her life is in place. The movies dramatic tension such as it is rests on how she negotiates the responsibilities of a big work project that pairs her with Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) an attractive mover and shaker and her busy home life during one autumn and winter. Mild and unchallenging I Dont Know How She Does It is geared to an audience of settled sorts. This would be the movie Id end up seeing with another tired mom friend if I couldnt coax her into Contagion. (Lice are a drag but a pandemic has real intrigue.) Parkers Kate is a sympathetic character; in adapting Allison Pearsons popular novel screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada Morning Glory) scales back on the rottenness of Kates arch nemesis at work Chris Bunce (Seth Meyers) who in Pearsons book is a full-blown sexual harasser. Its the heartless girls who get the most lines Kates smart young assistant Momo (Olivia Munn) and a competitive ""Momster"" (Busy Philipps) both of whom are full of contempt for Kates perpetually-running-late-and-smeared-with-pancake-batter life. McGraths film has the rhythm and glossy look of a romantic comedy. But with no obvious endpoint like a wedding it meanders leaving the impression of a group hug over (or wallow in) the complications of motherhood. When Kate cries out ""I have planned everything so this exact thing wouldnt happen"" mothers everywhere will know her pain. But while the dilemmas of working motherhood have been well-chronicled all the hand-wringing hasnt produced any miraculous ideas about managing what are really two full-time jobs. Kate could go out for cigarettes and never come back or maybe even run away with tempting Jack but she loves her kids and she loves her husband. She could quit her job but she loves that too and since Richard is working freelance presumably her salary is much needed in the well-appointed Reddy household. Interestingly in a movie about a woman who works with money that issue is never discussed. This is a cautious movie eager not to offend. Whereas Pearsons Kate was a feminist who plotted revenge on Bunce and seriously flirted with Jack the movie version of her is softer prone to saying ""Thank you"" too much. Unlike the character Uma Thurman played in the dreadful Motherhood Kate Reddy wont make anyone -- not even Momo who is baffled by Kates interest in her children -- consider swearing off motherhood. Unlike Kate Winslets character in Little Children Kate doesnt willfully act out her sense of oppression. Shes nice. If she were on a talk show shed come across a lot like Sarah Jessica Parker decent earnest and eager to please. Even though Kates time is fractured she never seems to take out her stress on her children. Its not that I Dont Know How She Does It tells actual lies about working motherhood -- many of its observations and jokes are on point. Its just that it omits the edge the desperation of a woman on the verge. (Rule of thumb if someone is using the phrase ""I dont know how she does it"" then ""she"" is on the verge.) The supposed maternal transgressions that Kate agonizes over like bringing a store-bought pie to the school bake sale are so minor so forgivable. I Dont Know How She Does It holds up a mirror for the modern mother but gazing into it many of those mothers are likely to think theyre looking into one of those trick mirrors found in some stores the kind that help sell bathing suits by making everything look better. The movie reflects an idealized version of someone failing. If only all such bad mothers could be so good.

For Kate Reddy Bridgets spiritual cousin and the working-mum heroine of Allison Pearsons corking novel I Dont Know How She Does It the division is not about marital status. More about I Dont Know How She Does It >> Kate divides the female universe between proper mothers who dont work outside the home and those who Cut Corners. The latter are the shuttlecocks rushing breathlessly from professional to domestic obligation too frazzled to enjoy either. And so busy making ""to-do"" lists that they dont sleep. In her breezily entertaining adaptation of Pearsons 2002 novel Aline Brosh McKenna working-girl screenwriter extraordinaire (The Devil Wears Prada Morning Glory) moves the story from London to Boston. The Americanized Kate is Sarah Jessica Parker. She has decamped from Big her Type A spouse in Sex and the City to Medium or should I say Richard the Type B hubby nicely played here by Greg Kinnear. (We will not speculate whether Richard an underemployed architect was at all suggested by Pearsons real-life spouse Anthony Lane film critic of the New Yorker.) Kate is a financial executive but if you ask her her job description is ""juggler."" The secret to this she says is not in catching the balls but propelling them forward. Whats fun about Parkers performance is her look of fraying professionalism. Watch this one-woman multitask force whip up a socially responsible retirement fund at the same time she plans her daughters (mostly) sugar-free birthday party. The brisk (89 minutes) film maintains speed and snarkastic tone by having its characters speak to the camera usually while sprinting to the next appointment. (Director Doug McGrath performs a gender reversal on classic Hollywood cinema in that here the female characters are always in motion and the male characters stationary.) Christina Hendricks has a small role as Kates best friend and Olivia Munn has a showier funnier one as Momo Kates perfectly groomed assistant. Momo is equally alarmed by Kates casual attitude to her hair and the sense that her boss primary relationship is with a smartphone. In another effortlessly funny performance from Kinnear Richard is likewise alarmed. Kate spends more quality time in New York with fund manager Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan charming) than in Boston with him. The most intimate Richard and Kate get is comparing agendas. Can this marriage be saved? Can this career? In describing the conflict of a woman who has it all without enjoying it all Pearsons book had teeth. McKennas screenplay has only a smile. But is it ever good to laugh. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog Flickgrrl at http//www.philly.com/flickgrrl/.

Sarah Jessica Parker plays wife mom and executive in ""I Dont Know How She Does It."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Frantically juggling her duties at an old-boy financial firm against her responsibilities as a wife and mom Kate Reddy throws together a last-minute entry for the school bake sale by squishing a grocery store pie into a baking dish and dusting it with powdered sugar. Smart loving harried and stretched thin Kate tries to have it all all at once and winds up cutting corners every which way. ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" has the same air of slapdash multitasking. It piles on documentary-style interviews with characters talking straight to the camera freeze-frames that halt background players in their tracks while Kate spins us a monologue and animated to-do lists scribbling themselves across Kates bedroom ceiling to illustrate how saturated with responsibilities her mind has become. The result is like that bake sale pie All the ingredients are there but its really sloppy and not quite fresh. On the plus side Aline Brosh McKenna wrote the zingy zippy script. Its not at the level of her delightful work on ""The Devil Wears Prada"" or ""Morning Glory"" but three steps up from her ""27 Dresses."" Sarah Jessica Parker plays Kate which is good and bad. She makes an energetic flibbertigibbet and her Kate is more grounded than ""Sex and the Citys"" Carrie Bradshaw. But going on 47 Parkers a tad mature to be playing this part; the Kate of Allison Pearsons source novel was 35. The young children the architect husband (Greg Kinnear) just launching his practice her own determined climb up the career ladder -- these are dilemmas of an ingenue. When Kates plate-spinning act is at its busiest she gets a shot at creating a new investment fund with Jack (Pierce Brosnan) a charming unmarried executive at her firms New York headquarters. That means more time away from her increasingly resentful family more stream-of-consciousness soliloquies about guilt and a whiff of extramarital temptation. Casting reservations aside Parker tackles the role with gusto. A scene in which she attends a crucial hedge-fund meeting while uncomfortably infected with her kids head lice is terrific and she attacks the many scenes that make her scamper anxiously between appointments with racehorse agility. I DONT KNOW HOW SHE DOES IT  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG 13 for for sexual references throughout. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings The supporting cast is amiable with Christina Hendricks as Kates supportive best friend Olivia Munn as her dry-ice office assistant and Jane Curtin as her not-so-subtly undermining mother-in-law all doing excellent work. Douglas McGraths brisk direction Santo Loquastos handsome production design and Stuart Dryburghs creamy photography add immeasurably. Brosnan and Kinnear dont have enough to do; the screenplay never supplies a scene that brings them together which would have increased the emotional and comic stakes nicely. Ultimately this is a slice of deli pie tasty enough but warmed over. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"I Dont Know How She Does It | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; i-don-t-know-how-she-does-it ) I Dont Know How She Does It (United States 2011) September 15 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a challenge faced by every workaholic parent balancing the time-sucking pressure of a high-profile job with the needs of a family. Because of societal expectations and traditional norms women typically face more scrutiny and criticism than men when they fail to find the equilibrium point and even those who do often endure bouts of guilt and perceived inadequacy. Is too much emphasis placed on ""having it all?"" Despite a sit-com tone and jokey manner I Dont Know How She Does It is perceptive and honest when it comes to addressing these issues - primarily because both the novels author Allison Pearson and the screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna speak from personal experience. Director Doug McGraths light approach to the material conveys the conflicting dueling priorities without ever becoming too fluffy or too serious. I Dont Know How She Does It is a perfect example of a genre that was once referred to as the ""dramedy."" As the movie begins Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) the loving wife of Richard (Greg Kinnear) and the happy mother of two has just returned to her Boston home from a business trip. Shes a juggler keeping Richard her son her daughter her boss and her co-workers all in the air at the same time. When an opportunity arises at work for her to achieve a meteoric rise by collaborating with New York bigshot Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) she jumps at it despite the stress it places on her marriage. As a snide co-worker mentions this will give her kids an opportunity to bond with their nanny. Richard is supportive to a point but when Kates job whisks her away from her family immediately after Thanksgiving dinner and forces her to break promises to her children a rift begins to develop - one that isnt helped by a growing attraction between Kate and Jack. Despite a healthy heaping of honesty I Dont Know How She Does It is hamstrung by two problems one of which is obvious and the other of which is more subtle. The unfortunate ending which wallows in artifice is superficial and saccharine and unworthy of the material that precedes it. For roughly 70 minutes I Dont Know How She Does It comes across as smart and witty then it throws all that away in its quest for the perfect conclusion. ""Perfect"" in this case is synonymous with ""fairy tale."" The casting of Sarah Jessica Parker while understandable given her high favorability among the key demographic is a mistake. Parker is too closely identified with her Sex and the City character the self-centered materialistic Carrie Bradshaw. And although Parker is not Bradshaw the typecasting has left her stained (not unlike William Shatner/Captain Kirk during the 70s and 80s). Bits of Carrie cling to Kate like lichen to rotting wood and it creates a mismatch. Kate is not supposed to be a clone of Carrie - their values and concerns are different. Yet Parker portrays Kate in much the same way she plays Carrie forming a shrill and somewhat unlikeable personality. With Pierce Brosnan we never once think of James Bond; would that his co-star was able to put aside her past as effectively. The films approach of providing tangential material works within the playful context established by the screenplay. There are voiceovers instances in which a character (usually Kate) freezes everyone around her so she can address the audience directly and man-on-the-street interviews with supporting characters. These techniques can grow old quickly but I Dont Know How She Does It employs them sparingly enough that they dont wear out their welcome within the sparse span of 90 minutes that it takes the plot to unwind. They give the movie a loose freewheeling feel that increases its seemingly limited appeal. The core concept presented without varnish will hit home for many parents - especially working mothers. ""Outsiders"" may see Kate as somewhat petty and self-absorbed but those qualities will be submerged for those who identify with the protagonist. If not for the ending which cheapens the experience as a whole I might be recommending I Dont Know How She Does It without qualification. As it is the movie has more to offer its core demographic which will be forgiving of its faults than others. I applaud I Dont Know How She Does It for having something to say and for saying it in a manner that is largely non-preachy; I just wish it had spoken with a different lead and a stronger ending.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the wake of Lauren Weisbergers 2003 novel The Devil Wears Prada the publishing world saw a dramatic boom in an already-extant subgenre of chick-lit The swoony romance between a young awkward New York ingenue and the bland Perfect Man who falls for her in spite of her copious faults mostly because he doesnt have enough personality or agency to engage with them. I Dont Know How She Does It the film adaptation of Allison Pearsons bestselling 2002 novel of the same name is in all ways a continuation of that brand of story taken a few years down the line after the traditional happily-ever-after. Sarah Jessica Parker plays the clumsy horribly embarrassing but theoretically endearing protagonist whos trying to balance her high-powered career and her family; Greg Kinnear is her terminally vanilla generically charming husband. In theory the film is another hoary exploration of the pressures of modern womanhood but in practice it offers the exact same thing as those NYC ingenue books cookie-cutter wish-fulfillment and lifestyle porn for easily pleased lonely romantics. Director Douglas McGrath (Emma Infamous) and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada 27 Dresses) bring I Dont Know How She Does It to the screen in spritely bustling fashion cramming the storytelling with jokey voiceovers quirky freeze-frame asides onscreen text pop-ups and faux-documentary confessionals directly to the camera. The confessionals illustrate how fulfilling Parkers hectic have-it-all lifestyle really is as various subsidiary characters reveal themselves as shallow dunces by bragging about their one-sided lives focused exclusively on home life or work. Meanwhile though Parkers best friend insists in voiceover that shes fantastically capable both as a finance-industry go-getter and as a supermom Parker is actually miserable about neglecting Kinnear and their two kids while she travels around the country working to broker a high-end deal with investment wizard Pierce Brosnan. Like Parkers character I Dont Know How She Does It wants to have it all and has trouble committing to a course of action. Parker is meant to be seen as smart ambitious and capable but for comedys sake she trips over herself hikes her skirt above her waist to adjust her underwear while not realizing shes on a video conference call misidentifies how many kids she has and gets the worlds most exaggerated case of head lice. The films message is ostensibly that modern women can have it all if their priorities are straight but that thought somehow coexists with the off-putting homily ""Trying to be a man is a waste of a woman."" And the films overcrowded overstructured franticness undercuts its attempts at soulfulness and meaning at every turn. In some ways its a sweet comedy and its packed with enough gags that many of them inevitably hit home particularly those involving Olivia Munn as a none-too-bright up-and-comer who sees Parker as a terrifying example of how emotional attachments ruin a perfectly good career. But under all the flailing it embodies yet another cliche The story of a cell-phone-addicted parent learning about the joys of stopping to smell the diapers.

"Review I Dont Know How She Does It - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies I Dont Know How She Does It No how no way like real life I Dont Know How She Does It Sarah Jessica Parker in ""I Dont Know How She Does It."" Sarah Jessica Parker in ""I Dont Know How She Does It."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Thwarted by the same awkward timing that zonked ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" two years ago just when shopaholics began to seem extra-heinous the film version of ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" doesnt know how to do what I think its trying to do.I think its trying to acknowledge the real-world pressures shaping millions of womens work/life to-do lists. When the investment firm wizard played by Sarah Jessica Parker tells a colleague she got into fund management because people today are ""scared to death about their future"" its meant sincerely and Parker -- even in a disposable comedy with a puddinglike consistency and the aftertaste of something other than real sugar -- does not oversell it.Her comic and dramatic technique is formidable. If she can survive ""Did You Hear About the Morgans?"" and the second ""Sex and the City"" movie she can survive anything. Freely adapting Allison Pearsons 2002 London-set best-seller adjusted to Boston and New York locales and a tougher economy screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna has the devils own time juggling agendas. Its the same for Kate Reddy the Parker character who must negotiate time-sucking work projects; a backbiting rival (Seth Meyers) and a demanding boss (Kelsey Grammer); the sweet attentions of a high-powered colleague played by Pierce Brosnan; and a tightly packed calendar involving two kids a nanny and her super-easygoing-but-theres-a-limit husband an underemployed architect played by Greg Kinnear.The movie concerns three especially chaotic months in Kates life. In addition to direct-address bits to the camera the script relies largely on Kates musings in voice-over whisking us back in spirit to the comparatively carefree days of Parker in ""Sex and the City"" (which on television lets remember was often wonderful).But the comedys forced and rather forlorn in ""I Dont Know How She Does It."" We first see Kate whos Type-Triple-A as she desperately repackages a store-bought pie for a bake sale to make it seem homemade. Old joke; no new spin. Each supporting character gets placed into her own little box labeled ""shrill stay-at-home exercise-mad mom"" (Busy Philipps plays the queen of the elliptical machines) or ""generically supportive best pal"" (Christina Hendricks) or ""workaholic assistant reminiscent of Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada"" (Olivia Munn as Kates driven aide-de-camp Momo).""The inside of a working womans mind"" one line goes ""is like the control tower at OHare Airport."" True and yet doesnt that sort of generica belong to the era of ""9 to 5""? ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" condescends inadvertently to its female characters even as it flatters their juggling abilities. The story lacks the wit to say something about double standards or gender politics in a crummy economy. While on a business trip to Cleveland Kate and the neutered version of Big played by Brosnan take a night off from their spreadsheets to go bowling with an alley full of working-class stiffs. (So thats where the middle class went -- Cleveland) This bit has a strange aftertaste; it plays as a ploy to ""humanize"" the socioeconomically advantaged. Also for a movie largely about temptation ""I Dont Know How She Does It"" has a weirdly low sexual current. Whenever Kate and her husband argue about their dangerously low rate of intercourse or some other matter the stakes seem low the friction frictionless. The Brosnan character apparently has been keeping himself chaste all these years (since the loss of his wife) for That Girl -- sorry Carrie Bradshaw -- sorry Kate Reddy. I enjoy a lot of these performers. But performers can do only so much to specify what is not specific or vivid. Near the end theres a series of glimpses of Parker and Kinnear beaming (high-beaming really) at each other from across a crowded room. As much as I like those two even in reduced circumstances those shots are enough to make you urp.mjphillipstribune.comI Dont Know How She Does It -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (R (for sexual content and language)Cast Sarah Jessica Parker (Kate Reddy); Greg Kinnear (Richard); Christina Hendricks (Allison); Olivia Munn (Momo); Pierce Brosnan (Jack Abelhammer); Kelsey Grammer (Clark); Seth Meyers (Chris Bunce); Jane Curtin (Marla)Credits Directed by Douglas McGrath; written by Aline Brosh McKenna based on the novel by Allison Pearson; produced by Donna Gigliotti.

I Dont Know How She Does It (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review I Dont Know How She Does It (PG-13) This comedy about a woman trying to balance family and career is better than you might think. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald9/14/2011 Editor rating 2.5 A film in which a busy working mother frets over bringing a store-bought pie to a school bake sale could quite fairly be accused of focusing exclusively on First World problems. But then if youre reading this chances are you live a First World life and so may appreciate the juggling act required of the working moms in the domestic comedy I Dont Know How She Does It. Adapted from the novel by Allison Pearson the film stars Sarah Jessica Parker as the driven uber-capable Kate Reddy who works for a high-powered investment firm and travels more than her supportive husband (Greg Kinnear) might like -- he has just started his own business and is pretty swamped himself -- but still manages to dote on her two young children.Kate gets everything right her best friend Allison (Christina Hendricks of Mad Men) tells us with a sparkling grin. All the other moms are amazed at Kates ability to have it all until suddenly cracks begin to show in her impressive veneer. Her obsessive list-making isnt enough to ward off the disasters ahead when the demands of a time-consuming career clash with kids who refuse to stop growing up while Moms at the office. That store-bought dessert is just the first step in Kates downhill slide which includes missing her sons first haircut and the dawning realization that one of the perils of business travel is that it can throw you into the circle of handsome businessmen like Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) a patient charming guy whose expensive suit is free of Cheerios spew and who doesnt seem to mind the fact that Kate is inevitably doing something foolish or embarrassing every time he sees her. For someone whos allegedly a genius in the tricky world of high finance Kate seems dangerously inept at basic technology. Sending email to the right people hiding text messages from prying eyes and knowing not to adjust your pantyhose while Skyping are really pretty simple rules by which to live. I Dont Know How She Does It makes good use of the overused mockumentary style and occasionally allows Kate to freeze the frame in order to speak directly to the audience little conceits weve seen before but still work well enough here. The humor tends to be broad but the spritely pace doesnt allow for too much lingering on the jokes that dont land (really weve seen enough morning sickness bits to make us gag). Olivia Munn and Busy Phillips do some nice supporting work here as Kates tightly wound assistant (Munn) and a nonworking mom just barely concealing her own stress (Phillips) and in its pleasantly sit-comish way the movie makes a few pointed observations about the disparity of expectations for men and women in the workplace. The path Kate will eventually take is anything but surprising; no movie is going to come down in favor of work over family. Still I Dont Know How She Does It does allow that some people -- women even -- are deeply fulfilled by their work and need their jobs for more than financial reasons. For a movie its pretty good at that balancing act Kate works so hard to achieve. Cast Sarah Jessica Parker Pierce Brosnan Greg Kinnear Christina Hendricks Kelsey Grammer Seth Meyers.

The first is that the movie is based on a 2002 novel by British journalist Allison Pearson and we live in 2011. True Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) is now an ""investment manager"" in Boston rather than a British hedge-fund shark. Otherwise Kate.2011 has the same accessories as Kate.2002 including a cute architect husband (Greg Kinnear) two kids who push Mommys guilt buttons and various male associates oblivious to commonplace 2011 workforce realities. Into this time warp screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (Morning Glory 27 Dresses) adds gratuitously bitchy stay-at-home gym-rat mothers and a boss (Kelsey Grammer) who blanches at the word mammogram. Pierce Brosnan plays a fairy-tale New York businessman as princely as he is single. The second insurmountable problem is the difference between Parkers performance as a fortysomething banker wife and mother musing (in voice-over) at her computer and her previous performance as a single thirtysomething girl-about-town in Sex and the City There is none. I dont know why she does it.

Instead the Sarah Jessica Parker comedy would be opening with the name ""Please Dont Make Me Watch Another Minute of It."" I Dont Know How She Does It Director Douglas McGrath. Cast Sarah Jessica Parker Greg Kinnear Pierce Brosnan. Rating PG-13 for sexual references. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb The actress is in full brittle mode as Kate Reddy a harried Boston woman who juggles two small kids and a husband with her gig working at a high-powered investment firm. The films skewered sense of reality is apparent early. Kate arrives late from a business trip and panics because her local deli is out of ingredients to bake a pie for her daughters class. Seriously there are no open-all-night supermarkets in Boston? Equally hard to buy is Kates success in the business world because shes such a total ditz most of the time. During a teleconference with a business executive (Pierce Brosnan) Kate starts adjusting her underwear apparently not realizing how cameras work. Is she a dolt or is the screenplay simply selling the character out for cheap laughs? Well be kind and go with the latter. Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna has scored with similarly themed material (""The Devil Wears Prada"") as well as missed (""Morning Glory"" ""27 Dresses""). Here she doesnt come anywhere near the bulls-eye as she trots out moldy cliches about working women that were more imaginatively served by ""Baby Boom"" nearly 25 years ago. It doesnt help that the characters announce their platitudes directly to the camera in faux interview segments as if they were fresh revelations rather than overly familiar statements. Subtlety is never this movies strong point; then again its nearly impossible to pinpoint what this movies strengths are. Its definitely not taking advantage of a talented supporting cast as Greg Kinnear Kelsey Grammer Seth Meyers and Christina Hendricks are among those wasted. The children in the film are not well-used either as the twins who play Kates son (Julius and Theodore Goldberg) constantly seem to be looking off-camera for direction. Getting even shorter shrift is poor Jane Curtin stuck playing Kates mother-in-law. She moans about how things were easier when she was raising children and women knew their place although she obviously was raising her kids in the womens lib 1970s not the Eisenhower 50s. Those kinds of touches simply emphasize how backward and thoughtless this whole project feels. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

I Dont Know How She Does It is based on Allison Pearsons 2002 diaristic comic bestseller and directed by Douglas McGrath. But its real auteur is screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna scripter of wan workplace romantic comedies such as the limp fashion-magazine satire The Devil Wears Prada and the TV-news-show time-passer Morning Glory. The heroines of those two films are single and ambitious and triumph both professionally and romantically. Kate Reddy (Sarah Jessica Parker) the protagonist of I Dont Know How She Does It must balance even more a career in hedge-fund managing a spouse and two young kids. Workplace movies McKenna is quoted as saying in a recent favorable New York Times Magazine profile ""allow characters to really tell each other the truth."" The screenwriters latest project however is filled with lies.We first meet Kate in the wee hours of the morning as she returns from a business trip to her Boston brownstone. Still theres work to be done At 2 a.m. she jerry rigs a deli-bought pie to look homemade for her kindergartner daughters bake sale. Husband Richard (Greg Kinnear nobly enduring) is hoping for some action in the marital bed. In both her home and work life Kate must constantly anticipate needs and strive never to disappoint impossible expectations that she tries to meet with ever detailed logistics--planning that becomes even more complicated when her job demands that she travel to New York frequently to work on a project with a colleague there Jack (Pierce Brosnan).How does Kate do it? She is strong she is invincible she has the same surname as the singer who made ""I Am Woman"" a hit. She is also played by Sarah Jessica Parker a performer so aggressively determined to make us like her that no work-life conflicts in the film ever gain any traction; were too distracted by the actresss manic tics (the head tilts the popping of the wounded-deer eyes) to notice any real adversity. (The fact that SJPs constant voice-over immediately recalls Sex and the City in which Carries ""job"" as a journalist consisted of filing a few bad puns a week doesnt help.) The promises Kate must break to her six-year-old daughter before leaving for yet another taxi ride to Logan Airport are simply moments for Parker to operate in the mode she knows best desperate pleading.Kate pleads cajoles and apologizes a lot though every time shes quickly forgiven and surrounded by an army of endlessly understanding helpmeets. Richard an architect with job concerns of his own shows some pique when his wife cant make it through Thanksgiving dinner without checking her BlackBerry and a bit of insecurity over the amount of time Kate is spending with Jack. But nothing is so insurmountable that a cuddle on the couch watching His Girl Friday cant fix it. (This nod to the 1940 Hawks screwball classic--a real workplace comedy--does further disservice to the film were stuck watching.)In a significant departure from Pearsons book Kate doesnt have to make any real compromises about fulfilling her husbands and childrens needs and her own commitment to a job she loves; her seemingly obstinate boss becomes in the end as supportive and understanding as everyone else in her life. She does get it all with Parker straining for maximum adorableness when she announces to her spouse her renewed determination to be there for her family ""Ill still be a mess you know.""Its not the job of I Dont Know built as a mass-market diversion to proffer real solutions to intractable problems. But wouldnt the film serve its intended audience--moms who do it all--better with more messiness and less fantasy? (In another example of the movies cracked reality hedge-fund managing is redeemed as a ""helping"" profession aiding investors as they plan for retirement.)What for example is the work-life balance like for Kates friend Allison a single mom and lawyer (played by Christina Hendricks one of many excellent supporting actors who provide the films only real pleasure)? Thats avoided entirely just as a sudden reversal of an earlier decision by Kates solo child-averse assistant Momo (Olivia Munn) sidesteps a difficult decision faced by millions of women. ""Somehow someway someday things have to change"" Kate gushes to Richard during her vow to focus on the family. I Dont Know blithely acknowledges the obvious while still perpetuating the impossible.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Bleed Racer Drive doesnt go anywhere despite Gosling and gore. Plus Hollywoods greatest (flawed) new female auteur. By David Edelstein Published Sep 11 2011 ShareThis Christina Hendricks miscast in Drive (pictured) charming in I Dont Know How She Does It.  (Photo Richard Foreman/Courtesy of FilmDistrict) September brings the higher trash like Nicolas Winding Refns Drive which is every bit as dumb as Augusts Conan the Barbarian but awash in neon-lit nightscapes and existential dread with killings so graphic that you cant entirely believe what youre gagging at. (Youll never have to ask Is that person dead?) The hero (Ryan Gosling) is called Driver because thats what he does and what he does is what he you know is. Driver opens the picture with a monologue that mixes cold facts (Theres a hundred thousand streets in this city) with coldly pragmatic edicts to the criminals he carries to and from their high-pressure L.A. heists. (I give you a five-minute window Anything happens a minute either side of that and youre on your own.) Driver is an anti-blowhard taciturn watchful holding a matchstick between his teeth the way he holds his emotions in check. But hes also one of Gods Loneliest Men. He needs someone to love to risk everything forto give him a Reason to Drive. Refn a Dane is the sort of man to take Hollywood action movies to the next slick amoral and unbelievably vicious level. In Drives production notes he says Im very interested in the dark side of heroism how that unstoppable drive and righteous adherence to a code above the average persons can shade into something that is quite psychotic. Right the dualitywe get it. But Refn doesnt recoil from that psychosis He digs its potential for splatter. The murders are what gore freaks call ultra-wet with the camera stationed happily in the middle of crimson showers. Without the extreme violence Drive would be a lifeless rehash of such self-consciously existential thrillers as Walter Hills The Driver and Michael Manns Thief instead of Oh shit oh God this is so friggin hard-core Give Refn points as a mechanic. Hes deft. In an early heist sequence Driver uses his knowledge of the urban maze to evade both cruisers and copters and its such a tight twisty piece of staging that you wait for Driver to show off his genius for geography again. But after that its all exploding heads and slashed throats. Why would Gosling a fascinatingly cerebral actor take a role so far inside his comfort zone? Does he long to strike action-icon posesto be the new Nic Cage? Hes sane enough to keep the movie from drifting into Cagean camp but considering where it does go thats a hollow victory. Drivers bare apartment is down the corridor from a pretty young mother (Carey Mulligan) and her lonely little boy who make Drivers (and the movies) sap rise and lead to some moist domestic montagesuntil the husband and father (Oscar Isaac) gets out of prison and takes back whats his. But the ex-con is in debt to thugs who threaten to kill his wife and son if he doesnt commit a robbery whereupon Driverwho has given up drivingis driven to make one last drive People will line up for Drive for a look at some of the hottest actors of the momentand see little indication of what made them hot. Mulligan brings nothing to her part but drab earnestness and Christina Hendricks (as a moll) looks as if she wandered onto the wrong set. Its fun to see Bryan Cranstoncloser every week to finding his inner psychopath in Breaking Bad from which Refn could learn much about mixing extreme violence and moral complexitygimp it up as Drivers sweet luckless mechanic. But the only surprising turn is by Albert Brooks as a shady businessman who plays his cards close to the vest. Theres something magical about this performance You can taste Brookss pleasure in not for once having to work so hard to open himself up and be crazily humiliatingly vulnerable. Now he can relax and stay inside himself and open other people upwith a straight razor. America has a new A-list auteuramazingly enough a screenwriter and even more amazingly given Hollywoods biases a woman. Aline Brosh McKennas films include The Devil Wears Prada 27 Dresses Morning Glory and now I Dont Know How She Does It. All are smart comedies centering on smart harried ambitious women who fight off obstacles thrown in their path by threatened males and often femalesbefore they realize in shame that theyre in danger of losing the humanity that separated them from their type A adversaries. McKenna has a gift for screwball dialogue She gets the connection between headlong rhythms and psychological desperation. The problem is that her screenplays have soft centers not female-squishy but Hollywood-squashy her heroines heroic assertions of independence coinciding with her own surrender to commercial conformity. In the context of so much wit the pandering is scary. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Daily Edition Login to download I Dont Know How She Does It Film Review 1003 AM PDT 9/11/2011 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS The Weinstein Company Sarah Jessica Parker gets the job done in this briskly workable if thoroughly conventional domestic comedy. TWITTER Sarah Jessica Parker is joined by a top-notch supporting cast in this amusing but formulaic romantic comedy writes THR film critic Michael Rechtshaffen. In I Dont Know How She Does It Kate Reddy is the ""she"" in question -- a fortysomething modern woman struggling to juggle the demands of motherhood and a high-pressure career. Portrayed with an effortless verve by ever-affable Sarah Jessica Parker the central character in Douglas McGraths comedy is easy to root for even if the vehicle itself feels less than fresh and inspired. Based on the bestselling 2002 debut novel by Allison Pearson the film conjures up aspects of everything from Bridget Joness Diary (the book was originally set in London) to Baby Boom while playing safely within the well-established parameters of formulaic romantic comedies. Still thanks to Parkers empathetic performance and the fine work of her top-notch supporting cast the Weinstein Company release should prove relatable to female audiences of a certain age and stage whose comparatively carefree Carrie Bradshaw days are alas behind them. Moving the setting to American soil the screen version finds Parkers Kate lying awake nights mentally composing her all-important lists when not dashing to her job at a Boston financial management firm or back home to tend to her two young children and her unemployed architect husband Richard (Greg Kinnear). But her carefully-honed balancing act is thrown off-kilter when a career-making new account means flying back and forth to New York where she works closely with smooth exec Jack Abelhammer (reliable Pierce Brosnan) at the expense of being away from her resentful family. So how does she do it? As directed by McGrath (Emma Infamous) and penned by Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada 27 Dresses) with a lot of stopping to address the camera (a trait shared by several other cast members) and other tired sitcom-y bits of business that would seem more at home on the small screen. Fortunately McGrath ultimately moves beyond the shtick and keeps things moving at an agreeable pace relying on his talented ensemble to capably close the deal. Whether shes frantically trying to pass off a deli-purchased cherry pie as homemade for her daughters kindergarten bake sale or discovering shes suffering from an unpleasant attack of head lice at an inopportune moment Parker makes unforced amusing work out of the physical comedy while convincingly relaying Kates heavier more introspective dilemmas. As the professional/personal men in her life Brosnan and Kinnear also do an effective job of underplaying their respective characters maintaining a nice vulnerability; while Olivia Munn handily steals most of her scenes as Kates coldly officious junior assistant Momo.
