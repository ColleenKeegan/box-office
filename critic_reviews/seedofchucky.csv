This unsuccessful stab at the postmodern playfulness of Wes Cravens New Nightmare sees actress Jennifer Tilly (playing herself) assailed by her star-struck doll-sized alter ego Tiffany and homicidal boyfriend Chucky. The pint-sized psycho pair are now parents but their confused androgynous son Glen/Glenda needs to sharpen up his killer instinct. Scriptwriter turned writer-director Don Mancini piles on the in-jokes Chucky uses horror fanzine Fangoria as a wank mag while cult filmmaker John Waters relishes a cameo as a sleazy paparazzo. More fun however are the scenes in which the voluptuous helium-voiced Tilly gamely sends up her raunchy screen image. For all its bloody decapitations and disembowellings Mancinis heartless movie feels like a random assemblage of body parts. And despite his best efforts Scottish actor Billy Boyd (Pippin in The Lord of the Rings) cannot breathe life into Glen/Glenda a wimpy and uninteresting Dickensian waif.

That tolerance is tested in this fifth round of the winking semi-subversive horror franchise Seed of Chucky which pits the demon moppet his sexually confused son Glen (ex-hobbit Billy Boyd) and squeeze Tiffany (voiced by Jennifer Tilly) against...actress Jennifer Tilly who comes upon the clan while shooting yes a Chucky movie. Scream it aint The nonstop meta-jokes (including an inspired John Waters cameo) coagulate rather than spurt. But Tilly-as-Tilly playing a C-lister who offers herself to Redman for the Virgin Mary role in his self-directed Bible epic (no foolin) deserves a medal for sportsmanship. By far the most shocking carnage is Tilly carving up her persona. What a doll. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

See next articles See previous articles Site Navigation Site Mobile Navigation Advertisement Supported by Movies | FILM REVIEW A Little Doll That Could (Gut Stab Set on Fire) By ANITA GATESNOV. 13 2004 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Chucky the Killer Doll like some other 1980s movie stars has seen better days. In ""Childs Play"" (1988) Chucky a talking toy inhabited by the warped soul of a slain serial killer was the picture of innocence. And he showed some restraint. When a baby sitter wouldnt let his little-boy owner stay up late to watch television he threw her out the window. These days Chuckys face is covered with stitches (had some work done dear?) and he and his family are more into decapitating and disemboweling.Its hard to keep all the murders straight in ""Seed of Chucky"" the fifth film about this tiresome homicidal toy. Theres the man in a Santa Claus suit in a cemetery though that turns out to be part of a movie scene. And one couples stabbings are part of a dream. Others are real however the Hollywood special-effects man whose headless body spews blood like a fountain; the limo driver (stabbed); the rapper (gutted); and the dedicated celebrity assistant (set on fire). Don Mancini who wrote and directed this idiocy must hope that there are plenty of undemanding moviegoers out there.Each Chucky film (the others are ""Childs Play 2"" ""Childs Play 3"" and ""Bride of Chucky"") has had a different director but Mr. Mancini has written them all. Maybe the first picture was so clever because he had co-screenwriters Tom Holland and John Lafia. All indications are that Mr. Mancini benefits from the collaborative process.This time he set out alone to create a horror comedy with the premise that a Hollywood film is being made about Chuckys rampages. (See ""Scream 3"" four years ago.) This allows Jennifer Tilly the voice of Tiffany the title character in ""Bride of Chucky"" to play herself and she does her best. ""I should have played Erin Brockovich"" says the fictional Jennifer who hates Julia Roberts. ""I could have done it without the Wonderbra."" Jennifers romantic interest is the rapper Redman also playing himself. They meet because he is producing a movie about the Virgin Mary and Jennifer believes she would be perfect for the part ""I always loved the way she wears robes and wore her hair off the face."" To persuade Redman to cast her Jennifer invites him home to get to know her and her cleavage better.Meanwhile an unattractive freckled doll in England sees the animatronic Chucky and Tiffany on television and realizes that they must be his parents. The doll makes its way to Los Angeles and upon finding Mom and Dad in a prop room brings them back to life with a few magic words. They cant decide if their long-lost child is a boy or a girl so they name it both Glen and Glenda. (Im not convinced that a lot of slasher-film fans also know Ed Woods transsexual camp classic.) Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some descriptions of ""Seed of Chucky"" have identified Glen as gay and suggested that the plot revolves around Chuckys reaction to that. He is praying that his boy will be a mass murderer like his old man but appalled that he might be homosexual. Too bad thats not in the movie. Glen-Glenda puts on a wig and drag-queen makeup near the end but its more of a Michael Caine in ""Dressed to Kill"" thing. The plot actually concerns the dolls plan to impregnate Jennifer with Chuckys sperm.There is not a single scary moment in all of ""Seed of Chucky"" so laughs are welcome. Chucky pretends that killing is ""a hobby -- it helps us relax"" but Tiffany knows its an addiction and calls a 12-step programs hot line. She is urged to get to a meeting. ""No its really not an option"" she says. ""Itd just freak people out.""But most of the humor falls flat. Chucky tells his son that its not violence that people say is wrong its violins. (Apologies to Gilda Radner.) Mr. Mancini also tries and sputters out with a James Dean line from ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and a Jack Nicholson scene from ""The Shining."" One of the films little joys is John Waters in a small part as a sleazy photographer who ends up having his face melted off with sulfuric acid.""Seed of Chucky"" is rated R (under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes partial nudity graphic sexual situations (including a doll masturbating) numerous splattery murders and a flood of four-letter words.Seed of Chucky Opened nationwide yesterday.Written and directed by Don Mancini; director of photography Vernon Layton; edited by Chris Dickens; music by Pino Donaggio; production designers Peter James Russell and Cristian Niculescu; animatronic characters and effects by Tony Gardner; produced by David Kirschner and Corey Sienega; released by Rogue Pictures. Running time 87 minutes. This film is rated R.WITH Jennifer Tilly (Herself/voice of Tiffany) Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) Billy Boyd (voice of Glen/Glenda) Redman (Himself) Hannah Spearritt (Joan) and John Waters (Pete Peters).

Rogue Pictures DatebookDatebookChronicle11/13/2004Advance0422456670 Photo ROLF KONOW Seed of Chucky a kernel that never should have been planted 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Seed of Chucky Starring Jennifer Tilly. Chucky voiced by Brad Dourif. Directed and written by Don Mancini. (R. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Seed of Chucky"" opened Friday which means Oscar season has officially begun. Just kidding of course but were there an award for most bizarre and dispiriting comedy-horror hybrid featuring killer dolls the latest installment in the ""Childs Play"" series would have it locked up. As the title so delicately suggests the film involves the offspring of that stitched-up scoundrel Chucky and his va-va-voom doll wife Tiffany. The kids looks are quirky even for the progeny of killer dolls. Imagine the face of a baby camel painted a sickly gray-green and topped by a shock of red hair. Even Chucky finds the kid unattractive and he has little room to talk. Notice the avoidance of pronouns when describing the child. Thats because the doll is of unclear gender and answers to Glen and Glenda. Here ""Seed of Chucky"" director-writer Don Mancini evokes a filmmaker of greater subtlety Ed Wood. Sure Woods movies were cheap but they never to my knowledge involved a doll artificially inseminating a person. That person is Jennifer Tilly or at least the version of herself she plays in ""Seed of Chucky."" Tilly also voices the Tiffany doll as she did in the last Chucky film ""Bride of Chucky."" In the tradition of exhausted horror franchises ""Seed of Chucky"" goes inside the making of the ""Childs Play"" movies for a stab at Hollywood satire. It falls flat. Tilly paints herself as a tramp and laments that all the good roles are going to Julia Roberts a complaint that carried more weight in say 1999. Youve got to love Tilly for being game for anything but references to sex scenes with Gina Gershon in ""Bound"" seem desperate. The audience for ""Seed of Chucky"" is hardly the same audience who saw the Wachowski brothers smart 1996 noir. But really who is the audience for ""Seed of Chucky""? Fans of rapper Redman might get a kick out of his lascivious performance as a casting-couch director but not enough of a kick to sit through the rest of the picture. John Waters has a couple of decent lines as a paparazzo skulking around Tillys house but he disappears early. Waters obviously just wanted to be part of this project in any way he could. ""Seed of Chucky"" might appeal to that small but passionate group of people who yearn for doll domestic drama. Chucky and Tiffany spend more time discussing child-rearing issues than wielding knives. There are a few slightly scary scenes but they happen in dream sequences and in a scene from the movie within the movie thereby watering down the horror element.

Latest episode which opened Nov. 12 without press previews likely will attract only diehard devotees of the on-again off-again series. Scraping the bottom of the barrel with more determination than inspiration writer-director Don Mancini offers a slapdash mix of camp and carnage in ""Seed of Chucky"" fifth installment of the killer-doll horror franchise that began with cult-fave ""Childs Play"" (1988). Latest episode which opened Nov. 12 without press previews likely will attract only diehard devotees of the on-again off-again series. Pic simply isnt funny or frightening enough to expand its appeal beyond core fan base. On the other hand fleeting theatrical exposure should serve as prelude to extended vidstore shelf-life. Original ""Childs Play"" -- co-scripted by Mancini from his original story -- established basic gimmick of a two-foot-tall plastic doll nicknamed Chucky who slices and dices human supporting players after being possessed by the spirit of a dying serial killer played by Brad Dourif. (Just as Mancini has written all five pix Dourif has voiced Chucky throughout entire series.) Initial pic and two sequels were relatively serious slasher thrillers. Seven years after ""Childs Play 3"" (1991) however series was revived with greater emphasis on grisly humor and macabre wisecracks. Tonally reconfigured ""Bride of Chucky"" (1998) matched Chucky with another diminutive psycho -- Tiffany a femme homicidal doll possessed by the spirit of the original serial killers girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly). Latest pic Mancinis debut effort as feature helmer recycles self-referential elements from ""Scream"" series. As ""Seed of Chucky"" begins aud sees pic-within-pic production proceeding apace for ""Chucky Goes Psycho"" a horror thriller loosely based on the ""urban legend"" of knife-wielding killer dolls. Jennifer Tilly -- played in a bold stroke of casting by Jennifer Tilly -- is the human star of the piece. (Tilly also provides the voice for Tiffany as she did in previous installment.) More importantly however the two dolls used as pic-within-pics chief props just happen to be the real Chucky and Tiffany. The fun couple is revived by their long-lost offspring Glen (Billy Boyd) whose anatomical incorrectness triggers a serious identity crisis. Sometimes hes Glen and sometimes shes Glenda presumably as a tribute to a notorious film maudit by Ed Wood. Glen/Glenda claims to be a nonviolent doll which greatly pleases Tiffany. But it doesnt please Chucky who more or less insists that that the family that slays together stays together. And speaking of family Chucky wants to expand his clan by impregnating Tilly with ... well take another look at the title. Despite frantic efforts to punch up the action with cheap shocks and nasty yocks ""Seed of Chucky"" never generates much narrative momentum. Indeed pic moves at a herky-jerky start-and-stop pace that suggests Mancini simply made up the scenario on a day-to-day basis during production. Scenes of blood-splattered excess are too obviously fake to be shocking. But that doesnt make them any less stomach-turning. Kidding allusions to ""Psycho"" and other classic shockers mostly fall flat. Credit Tilly for earning a few good laughs by allowing herself to be the butt of many snarky in-jokes. Pic abounds with wink-wink nudge-nudge references to her fluctuating weight her sexpot image her girl-on-girl action in ""Bound"" -- and most hilariously her less-than-stellar status in the Hollywood firmament. ""Look at me"" she wails (in character of course) during a lull in the ""Chucky Goes Psycho"" filming. ""Im an Oscar nominee and now Im bleeping a puppet"" Rapper-actor Redman has a couple of funny moments as himself -- or to be more precise a comically exaggerated version of himself. (Hes producing a Biblical epic and Tilly will stop at nothing to be cast as the Virgin Mary.) But casting of camp maven John Waters as a scandal-seeking paparazzo doesnt pay off with expected laughs. Animatronic dolls are persuasively lifelike but other production values are spotty. Drab lensing is particularly unimpressive. For the record Pic may be first Hollywood-set horror opus to be filmed largely in Romania.
