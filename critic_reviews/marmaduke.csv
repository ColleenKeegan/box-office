Marmaduke (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Marmaduke (PG) Cmon you knew it was going to be a dog. Marmaduke is livin large in Orange County California with his owner Phil Winslow (Lee Pace). Share Print Save to your profile By Roger Moore The Orlando Sentinel6/3/2010 Editor rating 1.5 Marmaduke the comic strip about life with a 200-pound canine earns a dull but harmless big-screen comedy aimed at the youngest moviegoers. Got kids? Be thankful this isnt in pricy 3-D. And be thrilled that unlike Beverly Hills Chihuahua Marmaduke wont inspire anyone to pick up a Great Dane at the pet store on the way home. Owen Wilson who narrates and chats up his fellow members of the Housepet Kingdom thanks to digital assistance gives the first 15 minutes of this movie a light touch detailing his life with his owner ``Dr. No he calls him (Lee Pace not funny) Dr. Nos wife (Judy Greer given nothing funny to do) and ``the other two-leggers a boy he calls a ``padawan a teen sister and a toddler. Then in a stunning development this Kansas family moves to Southern California land of sun surfing and status-conscious dog parks. Poor Marmaduke has to find ``a new leash on life. ``Its like high school for dogs explains Mazie (Emma Stone) the streetwise Queensland Heeler. The dog-park cliques include airhead blondes (Afghan hounds) bullied small fry (dachshunds Chinese Crested) and mutts. The pedigreed top dogs are led by the bully Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) a Rottweiler-ish beast who surfs and keeps his collie girlfriend Jezebel (Fergie the singer not the bribe-soliciting ex-royal) under his paw. Marmaduke has to establish his place in the pack learn to surf help ``Dr. No get in good with his boss (William H. Macy) and figure out who his real friends are. Even by talking-critter comedy standards Marmaduke lacks mirth and imagination. Casting Wilson fresh off Marley amp; Me (he wasnt the dog in that one) and George Lopez (playing his pal the house cat) of Beverly Hills Chihuahua is no stretch. A dogs-trash-the-house scene is standard stuff and the SoCal dog surfing setting is just Hollywood geographical myopia. Director Tom Failure to Launch Dey recycles the ``pay attention to your kids the way your dog does message from The Shaggy Dog. But then bad jokes (``Cow-a-bark-a) are what pass for screenwriting here. Cast Lee Pace William H. Macy Judy Greer and the voices of Owen Wilson Emma Stone George Lopez. Director Tom Dey. Screenwriters Tim Rasmussen Vince Di Meglio. From the comic by Brad Anderson and Phil Leeming. Producers John Davis Tom Dey. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 87 minutes. Some rude humor language.

The deficiency of fart jokes -- only two actually -- doubtless will disappoint adolescent boys and the novelty of Owen Wilson providing a California stoner-style voice for the title character a humongous Great Dane wears thin after 15 minutes or so. But ""Marmaduke"" still might end up fetching a tidy sum at the summer box office given the relative lack of live-action kid-centric fare currently available at megaplexes. And while Fox isnt likely to score numbers comparable to those of its ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" franchise homevid biz for this uninspired comicstrip-spawned opus could be impressive. Freely adapted from the long-running syndicated comic created by Brad Anderson and Phil Leeming ""Marmaduke"" relies heavily on CGI trickery and aptly cast vocal talents for a multitude of gags involving anthropomorphic shenanigans. Clueless ""two-leggers"" remain totally oblivious as their canines -- and an impudent cat voiced by George Lopez -- freely converse with one another. Thats the central gimmick and helmer Tom Dey (""Failure to Launch"") milks it for all its worth then continues milking like a dairy farmer desperate to make the mortgage. Scripters Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio have cobbled together a plot from bits and pieces of other family-friendly pics about ambitious daddies discontented kids and the learning of life lessons. Advertising ace Phil Winslow (Lee Pace) packs up his wife (Judy Greer) and their three children and moves from Kansas to Orange County to work for the demanding president (William H. Macy) of an organic dog-food company. Also making the move is Marmaduke (voiced by Wilson) the great big family dog whose attempts at hipsterish cool are often undercut by his klutziness. Marmaduke manages to smoothly fit into his new surroundings by befriending three unpretentious mutts -- skittish Giuseppe (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) urbane Raisin (Steve Coogan) and tomboyish Mazie (Emma Stone) -- at an O.C. dog park. But the impulsive Great Dane also wants to hang with the pure breeds in the park. Hes immediately drawn to Jezebel (Fergie of Black Eyed Peas) a beautiful collie who unfortunately is the main squeeze of Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) who rules the dog park with a paw of iron. In a kidpic such as this you might expect Phil to get into trouble when he neglects his family -- and Marmaduke -- while pursuing career goals. And you might expect Marmaduke to get into trouble when he neglects true friends while pursuing entry into the ""in"" crowd. Not surprisingly expectations are fulfilled. Indeed the only real surprise in ""Marmaduke"" is a cliffhangerish climactic sequence that weirdly enough plays like an outtake from ""2012."" The humans on view are unremarkably bland -- even Macy merely goes through the motions -- so its up to the animals and their unseen spokespersons to generate chuckles and sustain interest. Thanks to the CGI wizards the four-legged stars get to dance -- and surf -- as well as move their mouths while speaking. Except for Wilson and Lopez however the only real standout among the vocal talents is Sam Elliott briefly but effectively intimidating as a legendarily fierce English Mastiff named Chupadogra. With extended closing credits ""Marmaduke"" clocks in at 88 minutes and feels longer. Its worth noting that a few jokey allusions to drugs -- gags that presumably are aimed at viewers older than the pics target demographic -- are scattered throughout the action. Maybe the filmmakers suspect that after ""Marmaduke"" is available on DVD certain folks might enjoy watching all these talking animals while sampling some herbal supplement?

Rachel Weisz plays Hypatia a brilliant astronomer in 4th-century Alexandria whose life and work is increasingly threatened by a bloody societal shift toward reactionary virulent Christianity. To its credit the film calls out Christianitys ignominious imperialism and locates a valid historical analogue to todays religious extremism. Yet good intentions shant save Amenabar from his own ham-fisted methods. Its one thing to depict crusaders hurling a cynic onto hot coals ritually slaughtering pagans stoning and massacring Jews and enforcing total faith -- but need they wear uniformly dark ragged cloaks and snarl through unkempt faces while pagans dress brightly bathe frequently and no doubt smell really good? Servant boy-cum-wispy-indie-rocker-of-antiquity Max Minghella even comes to learn that slavery is far better than belief. Amenabars camera assumes extreme low- and high angles setting heroes against starry skies before freely zooming back to assume a celestial POV (praise be to Google Maps). Whats missing is a satisfying plausible middle ground where heady ideas and metaphors coalesce into compelling drama. Amenabar (The Others Open Your Eyes) has the ambition but not yet the skill of a Kubrick or Spielberg to make visual flourishes function emotionally. The music swells characters glower and suffer in slow-mo and Amenabar champions the life of the intellect by condescending to ours. (Eric Hynes) (Landmark) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - BURZYNSKI Eric Merola a former art director of commercials is either unusually credulous doesnt understand the difference between a documentary and an advertisement or has an undisclosed relationship with the subject of his allegedly nonfiction first film. Consciously or not Merola is shilling madly for Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski a Polish-born physician who has run afoul of federal authorities and shown up on several quackometers for his claim to have cured scores of patients of a lethal brain cancer with a treatment derived from animal urine. Burzynskis smooth patter and bad dye job dont clinch the case against him -- though how he gained the trust of desperate patients is anybodys guess -- but neither do they mitigate the powerful stench that rises from his plaintive cries of victimization by ""jealous"" government agencies and courts that blocked his right to complete clinical trials. Narrated in a weirdly robotic voice-over Burzynski violates every basic rule of ethical filmmaking Merola interviews only Burzynskis supporters; produces no patient records other than the doctors own; and offers no credible proof of the drugs success and no data about its side effects even as he slams chemotherapy and radiation. Whos the bigger charlatan -- Burzynski or Merola -- and why is this conspiratorial rubbish being released into theaters? (Ella Taylor) (Music Hall)JOHN RABE Like many historical dramas and biopics John Rabe operates between the extremes of broad-stroked symbolism and selective detail between poetic license and classroom exposition between history and his story. The film recounts the true and largely overlooked actions of German businessman Rabe (a fine Ulrich Tukur) whose decision to remain in Nanking during the Japanese siege of 1937 made him a hero in China and a nuisance to the Nazis. A loyal member of the party Rabe first fends off bombers by hiding factory workers underneath a giant swastika then commands a safety zone that spares more than 200000 civilian lives. Its a remarkable story and filmmaker Florian Gallenberger does his best to shade his portrait with complications and mitigations. But for a story not often told John Rabe feels awfully familiar deliberately recalling the wartime tragedies of Berlin Warsaw Spielberg Polanski et al. There are good Germans and bad Germans (one of the latter sporting a nasty scar) good Japanese and bad Japanese (snorting and glowering like dragons) a crack team of hardy heroes whiffs of romance among the ruins and somehow just one lead Chinese character. Historical melodramas like John Rabe soberly re-create events yet still manage to sensationalize them whether through lingering shots of stripped schoolgirls and decapitated heads or via a willfully uplifting climax. Cello-scored pantomimes of resilience and grief can make us feel but its not always evident who or what purpose that serves.

Sep. 13 600pm GO   LIVING IN EMERGENCY Uninterested in heroicizing  the four Western doctors it follows through their missions in the Congo and Liberia or even in whitewashing the ethical challenges of an organization like Medecins Sans Frontieres Living in Emergency Stories of Doctors Without Borders takes a rough -- in several senses -- measure of how humanitarian aid works. Two of the doctors are making their first MSF missions two are veterans -- one more wearied than the other. Director Mark Hopkins stays close to their experiences whether they are treating a hernia in a bush tent or celebrating their short-lived success in reassembling a broken skull. The doctors motivations remain somewhat enigmatic even as the two veterans emerge as more fully drawn characters. A matriarchal Italian in braids and long stylish skirts calls the decision to close a clinic in postwar Liberia ""a criminal mistake""; an Australian surgeon rips on UNICEF before suggesting in a rare moment of ethnographic dissonance that its more rewarding to practice medicine in war-torn Congo the current rape capital of the world because it is a country ""where people care about each other."" Hopkins focuses on the work refusing to get too close to his subjects who themselves struggle -- as a matter of survival -- against the human instinct to not just cure but to connect to those in pain. (Michelle Orange) (Music Hall) MARMADUKE Brad Andersons long-running saga of the melty-looking Winslow family and the gangling interfering Great Dane that shouldve been put to sleep ages ago gets a film treatment and once-mute Marmaduke now has expressive CGI-arched eyebrows and a voice provided by Owen Wilson. Relocated from Kansas to Orange County by master Phil (Lee Pace) Marmaduke tries to fit in at the new dog park. Its like ""high school for dogs"" explains a helpful mutt; why a dog would explain something in these terms is unclear though it prepares us for an off-the-rack HS movie plot as the hermitic one-panel strip opens up to a canine social world with its own strata topped by purebreds which Marmaduke must negotiate. In the parallel human B story Phil spends a lot of time working to provide for his family. That thoughtful Duke sabotages Phils professional life but the rest of us can hardly forget the workaday world in this haze of Dog Gone Awful puns (""Its raining cats and us"") surreal set pieces (""A surf competition for dogs?"") sound-track poots and a Sam Elliott-voiced mongrel maiming a dogcatcher offscreen while Fox secures the rights to Hagar the Horrible. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide)GO   MICMACS An exploded grandfather clock of a movie Jean-Pierre Jeunets intricately antic Micmacs hurls gears gizmos and other trash-heap objets dart at the audience. Its aggressively whimsically retro like a heaping second helping of his 1992 black comedy Delicatessen. Instead of the enchanted fairyland of his smash hit Amelie Jeunet burrows into the Parisian scrap-yard lair of the Micmacs a band of outcasts without superpowers but who have ingenious uses for old junk. Movie-quoting video-store clerk Bazil (Dany Boon) joins them after a nasty encounter with a bullet; that plus his fathers prior land-mine mishap has him vowing revenge on two rival arms manufacturers. Quicker than you can say ""Yojimbo"" the Micmacs spring into action. Magnets alarm clocks string and jars of wasps are the Micmacs preferred weaponry -- the team embodies Jeunets love of the handmade and the improvised which he then pits against the cold technology of the munitioners. (Though in one concession to our times Jeunet does allow the Micmacs to use YouTube.) Allusions are made to recent European arms deals in the Balkans and Afghanistan but Micmacs is more fantasia than violent revenge tale. And its pleasing curlicues -- like a bouquet of spoons-- linger long after the predictable outcome. (Brian Miller) (ArcLight Hollywood ArcLight Pasadena The Landmark)ONDINE A bad drunk dried out into a luckless loner fisherman Syracuse (Colin Farrell) lives for visits with Annie (Alison Barry) his wise-beyond-her-years crippled kid stuck in the custody of her still-boozing mom. One morning Syracuse pulls up his net and finds a shivering woman -- or is she a mermaid? -- and soon his fishing fortunes change. While Annie hits the books looking for a mythical explanation her dad falls in love with the mysterious creature who calls herself Ondine (Alicja Bachleda). Writer/director Neil Jordan gradually builds up the possibility of fairy-tale magic in an identifiably real world and then systematically knocks it down. This might have played as a welcome correction to todays brand of contemporary indie film which pairs poverty and whimsy neatly if Ondine didnt indulge in its own modern-movie claptrap. Eccentric yet unwittingly carnal prone to atonal gibberish Ondine is a grade-A manic pixie dream girl bringing a curmudgeonly outcast back to life with her kindness tolerance and perfect breasts. Ciphers aside Ondine effectively sustains a mood of a hazy melancholy most affecting when nothing much is happening Colin Farrell has the Best Enigmatic Stare in current cinema and Christopher Doyles gorgeous cinematography all foggy blankets of blue and green gives Syracuses uncertainty a tangible texture. The spell is broken with the plots final twist which suggests that the films core mystery wouldnt have been much of one had Syracuse been a fan of Icelandic ambient band Sigur Ros. Yes seriously. (Karina Longworth) (Landmark) THE PAINTER SAM FRANCIS The name in the title belongs to the California-born artist who set up in Saint-Germain-des-Pres during the 1950s was at the vanguard of introducing and selling American abstract expressionism to a European audience. This biography doc from Fluxus associate and all-purpose avant-garde hanger-about Jeffrey Perkins was 40 years in the making built on the foundation of a 1968 shoot of Sam Francis at work pulled along by his brushstrokes stopping to flagellate an in-progress canvas. For aficionados the evidently rare footage of Francis squatting on hairy thighs scampering ahead to stay intuitive before intellectual will justify the film. But if we learn something of the painters ""from-the-solar-plexus"" process here (""Its so easy"") the portrait of Francis -- from a 73 sit-down interview with the sapped and wary artist none too charismatic in his reticence and postmortem interviews with family and colleagues -- doesnt articulate enough to explain the films epic gestation period. Only an opaque outline of the subject comes through -- monomaniacally productive through illness five times married no candidate for Father of the Year -- and Francis finally impresses mostly through his masquerade of Grand Artist sartorial effects a big Salon des Refuses mustache and the mien of a feudal Japanese Zen painter. (Nick Pinkerton) (Monica Playhouse)PERRIERS BOUNTY While Hollywood has belatedly cooled on snarky loud-quiet-loud proto-Tarantino gangster comedies our English-speaking brethren across the Atlantic remain steadfast pumping public money into spawns of Sexy Beast and maintaining full employment for slumming stage-trained thespians. By no means the worst of the lot Gaelic import Perriers Bounty might be the most rote moving dutifully through the stations of the genre without establishing or generating any motivational thrust. Melancholic mess Michael (Cillian Murphy) has just a few hours to repay an unexplained debt to the town heavy Perrier (Brendan Gleeson) but his efforts at scoring cash only get him into deeper trouble. He goes on the lam with his tweaked gun-happy pa (Jim Broadbent) but shows more concern for a heartbroken crush (Jodie Whittaker) than he does for the bounty on his head. Hollowed of plausibility sincere characterization and any sense of real-life danger what remains is a thin and damned spotty skin of situational humor. For every welcome gag -- vindictive tow-truckers keep booting getaway cars -- theres a callous barrage of spit-take punch lines involving bodies hacked shot and foley-thumped to death. Instead of inspiring discomfort -- should we laugh or cringe? -- such violence engenders only ambivalence onscreen and off. Ivan Fitzgibbons film is so steadfastly blithe that one yearns for a flicker of pretension some small sign that theres a guiding principle or purpose other than to take the piss tiredly. (Eric Hynes) (Nuart)RAAJNEETI was not screened in advance of our deadline but a review will appear here next week and can be found at laweekly.com/movies. (Culver Plaza Fallbrook)SPLICE Though Sundance-screened and sporting an upscale cast Vincenzo Natalis Splice has a mad-science quality. Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are Clive and Elsa a married couple of ""rock star"" genetic engineers who are introduced midwifing the birth of a lab-grown maggoty sack of tissue which well soon observe in a mating tango thatll put you off your popcorn. Clive and Elsa then decide to tamper in Gods domain and toss a soupcon of human DNA into their recipe. What winds up in the incubator is a massive spermatozoon ending in an obscene glans which hatches a walking skinned rabbit which develops into an increasingly humanoid girl with a wicked harelip. Though hell more than accept their adoptee in time Clive is understandably creeped out at first by his wifes coddling treatment of the thing now christened ""Dren."" (Polleys glowing reaction shots while nestling her mutant toddler make a deadpan joke of parents indifferent pride over whatever theyve hatched.) In spite or because of the portentous gathering-clouds score and accumulated Freudian gibble gabble Splice is a queerly funny movie. Natali never drops his poker face but you cant tell me a moment like the Big Presentation where the front row of suits get splattered isnt supposed to be a knee-slapper. Of Splices various primal scenes thats-just-wrong coitus interruptuses and ridiculous dialogues delivered with unfailing conviction (""Was it ever about science?"") I am less certain of the intention. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide) Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact LA Weekly Follow LA Weekly laweekly L.A.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 04 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Jun. 03 2010 410PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Marmaduke Directed by Tom Dey Written by Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio Starring Owen Wilson and George Lopez Classification G The last time Owen Wilson kept company with canines he was the Me in Marley amp; Me playing second banana to a Golden Lab. Now hes the top dog in Marmaduke lending his voice to a Great Dane. On the basis of such recent evidence some might suggest that its clear where his career is going. But I wouldnt be so hasty. Since the box-office has never met a pooch it didnt love this too is clear Owen is barking all the way to the bank. Yes this is another opus to take that small well-trodden step from the funny pages to the big screen. But were in live-action territory here meaning that real people actors compete for camera time with real dog actors. In this case both species talk surely a tribute to how far cinema has progressed since the silent era. Being a gangly teenager oversized and under-co-ordinated Marmaduke talks like the klutzy outsider in a John Hughes flick. Happily thats no coincidence. Turns out his local park is a ""high school for dogs"" marked by the usual social strata - the jocks chasing frisbees the pedigrees acting cool the sniffing hounds getting high and the lowly mutts getting shunned. Add it up and we got ourselves a script not to mention a love triangle when Marmaduke falls hard for Jezebel the beautiful collie even as Mazie the half-breed tumbles for him. Of course like any teen he has lessons to learn and to impart. Seems that aspiring to join the in-crowd forgetting who your are and growing too big for your paws well thats a bad thing. In bright contrast sharing the off-leash area equally with tolerance shown to all elevating a hind-leg only in the service of nature and generally behaving in the spirit of doggie democracy thats a pretty good thing. Of such moral niceties Great Danes and great movies are made. Luckily when not lecturing on ethics our California kids know how to party hearty Dissatisfied with mere mastery of the Queens English and with only a teensy bit of help from the special-effects department these pooches can surf they can lounge poolside while getting really wasted they can trash a whole house when the folks are away and they sure can cut a rug. Oh they can dance too. And lest anyone think that canines have the market cornered on higher learning theres a smart kitty too. Carlos is a Russian Blue cat who speaks with a Mexican accent a testament either to the felines more evolved linguistic skills or to the fact that hes voiced by George Lopez. Ill leave you to choose. Meanwhile down on the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder Marmaduke has a pet family named Winslow. Daddy Winslow is dimly ambitious Mommy Winslow is nicely ineffectual Daughter Winslow is boy crazy. Occasionally Marmaduke takes them for a walk. Speaking of the descent of man William H. Macy makes an appearance as someone-or-other - if memory serves didnt he used to be an actor? Hey its all good clean fun. How much fun? Well like every big-hearted owner Marmaduke shares the bed with his pets. There in the opening scene and again at the end he offends their noses and tickles our fancy by breaking wind. Yep top dog king of the tycoons the James Cameron of the box-office the wily Duke has framed his film in fart jokes.

In this film publicity image released by Fox Marmaduke the dog is shown in a scene from ""Marmaduke."" Photo Joseph Lederer AP Review Fur paw cliques rule OC in Marmaduke 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Marmaduke Family comedy. With voices of Owen Wilson Emma Stone and George Lopez. Directed by Tom Dey. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Marmaduke is a comic strip about a large slobbering dog who tackles people. Thats it. No more no less. So whatever I and other critics have to say about this pat Hollywoodization of Brad Andersons 56-year-old strip doesnt really matter because the Great Dane in question will go on causing havoc on the funny pages for untold Sundays to come. But all I can say about ""Marmaduke"" the movie is its harmless. It causes neither physical nor extreme mental anguish unless the sight of dogs partying with cheese balls to the tune of Sean Kingston throws more hypersensitive viewers into a sudden emotional free fall. Tom Deys (""Failure to Launch"") film isnt exactly Milton meets Shakespeare with a dash of Brecht but its anthropomorphic doggie shtick should prove mildly amusing for the playground set. A few details you should know going in. First Marmaduke talks. The Marmaduke we know in print generally limits his vocabulary to ""Woof woofs"" and ""ARRRRR"" but this Marmaduke blabs pretty much nonstop. Assisted by (a) Owen Wilsons voice and (b) digitized lips he chats at length with his four-legged fellows who comprehend English but arent understood by human ears. To them Marmadukes orations sound like - well like ""Woof woof"" and ""ARRRRR"" Next Marmaduke chats with us man. Not only does he address the camera directly he actually covers the lens with his paw when preparing to take a dump in the yard. Finally the plot. Its been around. The film makes no bones (sorry) about its debt to ""Pretty in Pink"" which gets the Fido treatment from top to bottom. Outsider copes with class issues in a high school/dog park tussles with the purebreds and falls for a collie (i.e. Fergie). Kiefer Sutherland voices a bullying rottweiler and George Lopez is a house cat named Carlos. Emma Stone in the Jon Cryer role plays the faithful mutt who pines for the lead. -- Advisory Language and rude humor.

He could be both man and dog in the same movie.Wilsons laid-back voice with its easy comic timing is the most appealing thing about Marmaduke along with the very cute dog George the 140-pound Great Dane that plays the part (alternating with half brother Spirit). Adapted from the one-panel cartoon that appears in 600 papers including The Dallas Morning News the film like the dog is awkward and ungainly. Director Tom Dey who directed Wilson opposite Jackie Chan in Shanghai Noon gets tons of charming visuals from his large canine cast (along with somewhat creepy ones of the dogs ""dancing"") but has let this overstuffed story run away from him.The action begins with an oversize human teen struggling to adjust to high school. We morph from there to Marmaduke struggling to adjust to his life as a dog in a family of five - or six if you count Carlos the Russian Blue cat voiced by George Lopez. Movie Information MarmadukeRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Tom DeyStarring Lee Pace and Judy Greer and the voice talents of Owen Wilson George Lopez Fergie Marlon Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr.Run time 97 minutesMPAA rating PG (some rude humor and language)Synopsis The big dog feels like dancing in his big-screen debut.More movies from GuideLive.comThen it segues into Marley moments with Marmadukes messes exasperating dad Phil played by Lee Pace of the late lamented TV series Pushing Daisies.Marmaduke and Phil think they will get a chance to reinvent themselves when Phil decides to pick up his Kansas household and move to Orange County Calif. to work for the eccentric owner of an organic dog food company (William H. Macy). This leads us to parallel plots of Problems That Must Be Solved. Phil is not listening to his family (as in buying a soccer uniform for his son who doesnt like soccer) or spending enough time with them because hes trying to succeed in his new job.Yes the family really likes the big house with the pool and ocean view but not the work he is supposed to put in to maintain it.Similarly Marmaduke makes friends with some mutts like him but does not listen when they try to warn him about the snobby and mean purebred dogs in the dog park. So when he finally wins acceptance from the purebreds (thanks to some questionable help from Carlos) he ignores his old buddies just as Phil is ignoring his family.Throw in an ensuing dog romance triangle threats from a purebred voiced menacingly by Kiefer Sutherland words of wisdom from an even more intimidating mysterious mastiff voiced by Sam Elliott and a wild party at the house that turns Marmaduke into a runaway. Soon Marmaduke isnt the only one getting hopelessly lost.In other words its a lot of twists and turns for very little reward. But bottom line will the kids like it? Quite possibly. The film is packed with adorable dogs and kids with both Marmaduke and the dad ultimately coming through as heroes.As for parents? It could be a great opportunity for a snooze if you bring a little alarm that will ring in your earphones when the movie ends. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

An afterthought of a plot ships the family from Kansas to the O.C. offering SoCal set pieces -- like a doggie surfing contest -- to spackle the few gaps between big-dog-small-world jokes.

Starring David Walliams Finley Jacobsen Caroline Sunshine Ron Perlman Christopher Mintz-Plasse Director Tom Dey Release Opened Jun 4 2010  Editorial Review He ought to stick to the funny pagesBy Michael OSullivanFriday June 4 2010Like its titular hero the gawky Great Dane of comics fame ""Marmaduke"" the movie is an awkward thing. Part silly talking-animal comedy -- replete with toilet humor and lame wordplay of the sort that delights 5-year-olds -- it also involves for much of the last half-hour the prospect of our hero going to that big doghouse in the sky.Whats up with that? After ""Marley amp; Me"" is Owen Wilson (who provides the voice of Marmaduke) now contractually obligated to make movies every other year or so about losing a beloved pet? The films final reel -- in which Marmaduke runs away from home and is swept away by a broken water main -- is bizarrely intense. I wasnt exactly sitting on the edge of my seat but I can imagine that a lot of the movies target demographic will be. Its like an episode of ""Trauma"" tacked onto the end of ""Doctor Dolittle.""As for the rest of ""Marmaduke"" -- you know the funny part -- its just not very funny. Lines like ""Get your bark on"" ""Who let the dogs out?"" and ""Cowabarka"" abound. Many of the jokes revolve around excretory functions.Set in Southern California where Marmadukes family has moved from Kansas the story follows two threads. The first has to do with doggy politics whether the pedigreed dogs at the park are better than the mutts which apparently include Marmaduke (theres a reference to him being a mixed breed). He tangles with Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) the parks alpha male while flirting with Boscos girlfriend a collie named Jezebel (singer Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas) even as Marmaduke ignores the scruffy mutt who really loves him (Emma Stone).Meanwhile Marmadukes owner (Lee Pace) must negotiate the office politics of the organic dog food company he works for trying to please a demanding boss (William H. Macy) without alienating his own family. In parallel developments both man and beast will learn the importance of being true to oneself.This is all well and good but the movie is characterized less by this uplifting message than by frequent references to a well-known chain of pet supply superstores sponsors of a dog surfing contest that is integral to the story. I wont mention the name; the movie itself is already like one long commercial.As for all the lowbrow humor and groaning puns I cant say I wasnt warned.

Like ""Sex and the City 2"" ""Marmaduke"" features well-coifed bitches in heat nonstop puns and its very own Mr. Big. Unlike ""SATC 2"" this one is harmless and on occasion mildly witty. Owen Wilson voices the title Great Dane and if this Marmadude isnt the role he was made for I dont know what might be. How often does even Wilson get a chance to earn millions without even putting on his flip-flops? Marmaduke his cat pal (George Lopez) and the other animals talk but cant be understood by their family (several children plus parents played by Judy Greer and Lee Pace) who move them from Kansas to Orange County Calif. At the local dog run the title character (size of Seabiscuit courage of Scooby-Doo) encounters a segregated class system in which the ""Pedigrees"" rule thanks to the iron-pawed strongman Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) a Doberman. Boscos gorgeous collie girlfriend (Fergie) wants to hook up with our hero and be a Marmaduchess as does a kind-hearted mongrel (Emma Stone). The script is heavily based on mild wordplay (doggerel?) goofy party scenes and dull jokes based on things that come out of an animals hind end -- but once in a while some of it is funny as when one pooch notes that ""its raining cats and us."" Some nicely weird moments are the best ones as when a group of purse-carried Chihuahuas cosseted by fashionable girls complain ""We are not accessories"" and ""In my country I was a lawyer."" A teeny Chinese crested is worried about predators (""This is the land of the puma"") while the villainous Bosco boasts out of nowhere that ""Im the reigning SoCal surf champ."" Ive sat through a lot of beast-based cinema lately and predictable and thinly plotted as it is Id place ""Marmaduke"" well above ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" and even ahead of the Wilson-starring ""Marley amp; Me"" of which ""Marmaduke"" amounts to a loose remake minus the death. ""Marmaduke"" is also less unpleasant than last years ""Old Dogs"" but then again the stars of this film have less repulsive body fur than Robin Williams. Im envisioning a sequel that joins together two towering franchises only with an R rating for excessive gore ""Marmaduke Versus Alvin and the Chipmunks"" anyone?

(20th Century Fox) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 3 2010 512 PM Title Marmaduke If ""Marmaduke"" achieves anything its that it makes this past springs ""Furry Vengeance"" look like a masterpiece by comparison.A live-action adaptation of the one-panel cartoon seen in newspapers since 1954 ""Marmaduke"" thinks that simply animating housepets mouths will make it funny. But even to the under-7 crowd that trick wears off fast; todays savvy kids need a witty script an actual story line and human characters who arent merely accessories. Unless youre the Son of Sam killer having a dog talk to you for 89 minutes will likely make you drool from boredom.Owen Wilson not satisfied merely co-starring with a dog in ""Marley amp; Me"" loses any edge he had left by voicing the title pooch. When Phil (Lee Pace) his wife Debbie (Judy Greer) and their brood uproot from Kansas to California for Phils job as a marketer for a dog-food company their huge pet Marmaduke and his cat pal Carlos (George Lopez) are excited to go along.Yet life in Orange County isnt easy as the clumsy good-natured Great Dane has to win over a dog park full of cooler-than-thou pedigrees. He has better luck with the mutts especially Mazie a Queensland heeler with a crush on the new canine in town.But Marmaduke initially only has big sad eyes for a collie named Jezebel (Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas) - except her boyfriend the top dog Bosco (Kiefer Sutherland) rules the park with an iron paw. Only after Marmaduke stands up to the bullies does he appreciate the friends he has.That marginally educational message is lost amidst the movies middle-ground approach. In an attempt to be hip ""Marmaduke"" has its dog world be like high school with cliques and slang and misfits left out of parties. Yes young children may take their social cues from older siblings although this movies 6- to-9-year-old target audience would surely have enjoyed a more simplified dog tale.Not every kids movie has to be so snarky; if this movie like its producers previous adaptation of ""Garfield"" had kept younger viewers in mind it might not be so intolerable. It even has a moment of peril that might worry the kindergarten crowd.The result is a talking-animal movie that isnt worthy of cleaning ""Babes"" pigpen and a family entertainment far below the recent ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Shrek Forever After."" Its only redeeming values are an insane dog-surfing competition that feels like a weird dream you may have once had and a mangy street mongrel whose slobbery lips give perhaps the finest Sam Elliott performance ever.

"Movie review Marmaduke - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MovieMovie review MarmadukeOwen Wilson voices the Great Dane.June 04 2010|By Glenn Whipp Special to The Los Angeles Times Youve probably seen a panel or two of Brad Andersons ""Marmaduke"" comic strip at some point in your life. And chances are if you ever put a voice to the comics Great Dane it sounded something like Scooby Doo (""Ruh-roh Raggy"") because these dogs must all sound alike right? So when the movie version of ""Marmaduke"" begins and the overgrown title character opens his mouth and we hear Owen Wilsons Texas drawl theres an odd disconnect. It doesnt sound right. And its kind of fun. For about five minutes. Then the movie settles into a predictable family-film groove about being yourself and fitting in and passing gas and finding the answer to the age-old question Who let the dogs out? Marmaduke first lives in Kansas but soon moves to ""The O.C."" with his human family. The movie teaches us that 1) taking a job with an organic dog food company gives you the means to buy an ocean-front home in Orange County; 2) you wear fuchsia ties to work because ""thats how they roll in Cali""; and 3) its best not to remove your shoes when walking around in a dog park. Marmaduke spends most of his time at that Laguna Beach dog park which is portrayed as a pressurized high-school environment ruled by pure-bred snobs who look down their long noses at gawky mutts like our hero. Marmaduke makes friends with fellow outcasts but forgets them in a flash when sudden popularity allows him the opportunity to hang with the top dogs. Wilsons amiable vocal work keeps the predictability from becoming too grating. The movie takes a sharp strange turn in its last half-hour injecting some serious ""Homeward Bound""-style peril into the proceedings. But dont worry Marmaduke isnt going to meet Marley up in doggie heaven. With this dog sobbing takes a backseat to slobbering. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESScooby-Doo The Mystery BeginsSeptember 11 2009Iwao Takamoto 81; animator for Hanna-Barbera drew...January 10 2007Scooby-Doos two-legged friendMarch 21 2004Whats new Scooby- Doo?

"Marmaduke Shaggy dog tale deserves to be spayed | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMarmaduke Shaggy dog tale deserves to be spayedBeloved comic strip dog becomes lousy rip-off movie that kids may like but adults will find boring and implausible.Owen Wilson lends his voice to a Great Dane in Marmaduke.  (SUBMITTED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterThu. June 3 2010Marmaduke(1/2 out of 4)Starring the voices of Owen Wilson George Lopez and Sam Ellliott. Directed by Tom Dey Bad dog movie. Baaaaad dog movie.The people behind Marmaduke a shameless rip-off of a beloved (although somewhat limited) comic strip should all be assembled in one long line and forced to undergo a sharp rap on the snout with a rolled up newspaper. Because this Marmaduke is a dog of a film that deserves to be put down.Article Continued Below""Sell-out"" is the term that this film brings to mind as in creator Brad Anderson has clearly sold out in letting his award-winning cartoon creation which appears in something like 600 newspapers in 20 or so countries and has been around for more than 50 years be appropriated by Hollywood hacks and turned into a miserable howler of a movie.Beyond the name of the Great Dane and its owner Phil Winslow everything else has been bastardized in the worst way. The names of the other characters have inexplicably been changed a third child added for no good reason and -- the final indignity -- Marmaduke talks and talks and talks along with a pound-full of other dog characters and a family cat named Carlos (voiced by George Lopez.)Of course the other sell-outs are the actors who lent their voices to this bone-headed effort Owen Wilson -- whom the tabloids reported attempted suicide three years ago -- being the chief one. Did Wilson perhaps see into his own dark future one in which he voices the role of a large clumsy and not particularly interesting dog? Ditto for Lopez Sam Elliott Kiefer Sutherland (was his participation required by court order?) Sell-out sell-out sell-out.One could understand the participation of lesser-knowns playing the people characters like Lee Pace as the dad and Judy Greer as the mom but what about a respected character actor like William H. Macy playing Phils boss the owner of an organic dog food company? Why Bill why?The script is a collaboration between Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio the brain trust behind the truly wretched License to Wed starring Robin Williams as a deranged man of the cloth. That alone should be sufficient reason to consider giving this film a wide berth.Saddest of all the movie really isnt at all funny relying on corny dialogue such as ""dont be a weiner dog"" and ""its raining cats and us"" cardboard cut-out characters and pratfalls that will only amuse kiddies of the most limited imagination.A brief clip of Old Yeller meant perhaps as an endearing homage only reminds us that dogs can and do make compelling characters in movies. This one doesnt have any of that. Its relentlessly cloying stupid and pointless.With its sole redeeming feature the range of cute canines and precious pooches on hand this tale is a low-down dirty dog a mutt a mongrel a bowser a flea-bitten bag of bones. Too bad it couldnt just roll over and play dead.

However someone explaining Marmaduke - thats funny.""Mathletes curious blog mines the deep shallows of Brad Andersons cartoon which has been around since the second year of the Eisenhower administration. Its central figure is Marmaduke himself that Dennis the Menace of Great Danes a creature that might be perceived as Scooby-Doos dogfather.Going into Marmaduke the movie I was thinking along Sutherland lines. Marmaduke may not be funny but Owen Wilson as the voice of the Great Dane - now that has possibilities.Which in Tom Deys shambling comedy largely go unexplored.As talking-dog movies go Marmaduke makes Beverly Hills Chihuahua look like Up. Like its four-legged star Marmaduke is big slobbery and overeager qualities that no doubt will delight the discriminating 6-year-old but leave her parents yawning.It has two things going for it which overstay their welcome fast.First is its conceit that the dog park is like high school with preening pedigreed retrievers as the jocks glossy-maned Afghans as the cheerleaders and the mutts as misfits in this canine social order.Second is Wilsons wifty delivery. The tilted Texan sounds like John Wayne on laughing gas. That has its charms - for about 10 minutes. Mostly the packs of digitized dancing dogs resemble something one might see in a dog-food ad.Why did Wilson take the part? Possibly because his first mainstream hit was a decade ago in Deys Shanghai Noon. Possibly because the Labrador of actors the human half of Marley amp; Me is in his Shaggy-Dog Period kind of like Picassos Blue with fur.To the extent the movie has a plot aside from scratch-and-sniff jokes its that the Winslows Marmadukes clan move from Kansas to ""Cali"" - thats California to you - because Mr. Winslow (Lee Pace) got a job marketing a boutique dog-food brand.While the Winslows eldest Barbara (Caroline Sunshine) adjusts to her new high school Marmaduke adapts to his new dog park. He lusts after Jezebel (voice of Fergie) a collie with a glossy coat and mostly ignores Mazie (voice of Emma Stone) a friendly mutt who shares her beloved chew toy. Anyone over the age of 6 knows how this will resolve.As doggy movies go this one gets two paws out of four.Contact movie Critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + When one of the last sounds you hear in a work of family entertainment is a Great Dane passing gas theres only one conclusion to be drawn. The movie hates your family. Thats fine since its likely that your family will hate ""Marmaduke a sleepy carnival of talking animals based on a laughless comic strip that debuted in 1954 and refuses to go away. The movie bears a loose resemblance to its source material and makes the heart long for the crassness of ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua which is if only by comparison a work of grand ambition.""Marmaduke has Owen Wilson lazing his way to another dubiously earned salary. Between this assignment and ""Marley and Me he should be checked for fleas. Its his voice that whines in every scene as the majestic dog who cant help but behave in obnoxious ways meant for us to find cute. After one scene of the dog dragging around Lee Pace who plays Marmadukes owner Id seen enough. But more awaits. When Pa gets a new job at an organic pet company the dogs family ditches Kansas for a quiet street in Orange County Calif. where Marmaduke makes friends and enemies in the local dog park.The pets interact with each other as humans do -- theyre petty and territorial. While the humans mouths are stuffed with bogus sentiment ""A real top dog looks out for his family. Sigh. Pace and Judy Greer who plays his wife are two likable actors who have never been worse. Every line sags with forced cheer. I imagine a prescription drug is the only way to put up with farting dogs even after the studios check has cleared. The movie seems to hate the actors too.The true selling point is the composite technology which puts computer-generated mouths on actual dogs. Its almost sophisticated enough to be seamless. But in the many instances in which the camera requires an object to appraise an audience is free to notice that the parts dont quite match. The resulting sight resembles the animated interludes on ""Monty Python.Other animated effects are put to depressing use. Marmaduke surfs fake-looking waves and leads the atrocious all-dog dance number that closes the movie with the camera spinning and soaring. You watch the animals bodies lurch and jerk to the Romantics and lament ""Not since Scooby-Doo.  Minutes later were sent out of the theater with a closing-credits sequence in which a lemony liquid appears to spread across the screen.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its tempting simply to note that director Tom Dey bookends Marmaduke with fart jokes and leave it at that. Deys cinematic adaptation of Brad Andersons widely tolerated comic strip about a giant awkward dog is meant for kids. Kids love dogs and fart jokes. The goods are being delivered to the target audience. All others should look away. But leaving it there would mean ignoring the full awkward flavor of the movie which opens with the eponymous dog speaking in the voice of Owen Wilson about the difficulties of being a teenager. Whether he means hes a teenager in dog years or human years is addressed only by the sheer statistical improbability of a Great Dane--a famously short-lived breed--making it to double digits at least without crippling infirmities. A film about a wheezing hobbling Marmaduke would be a lot less fun than one that finds him in the prime of life. Or would it? Thats another question that lingers as the film follows Marmaduke and his owners (Lee Pace and Judy Greer) to California where Pace takes a job marketing an organic dog-food brand produced by eccentric dog-lover William H. Macy. There Marmaduke hangs out in a dog park populated entirely by other teen-esque dogs all of whom stick to cliquey packs in line with high-school-movie cliches from the pedigreed snobs on down. But these dogs dont just hang out together during the day. Thanks to the apparent mass negligence of every dog owner in their California town they also party all night playing Dance Dance Revolution or attending beach parties lorded over by a mean Kiefer Sutherland-voiced alpha dog. How can Marmaduke break his deadlock on the canine social order? Can you say ""A surf contest for dogs""? Well even if you cant William H. Macy can and its strange hearing his familiar Mametian cadence applied to the line. Strange too that writers Vince Di Meglio and Tim Rasmussen (License To Wed) would pack the script with references to The O.C. ""Who Let The Dogs Out?"" and other pop-culture items that were popular before their target audience was born. Those sorts of allusions whether or not they make sense are just a post-Shrek obligation now. So is the filling out of the voice cast with familiar names most of who sound appropriately bored. Marmaduke saves its farts for the beginning and end but the stink carries through the whole movie.
