Comments Dragonfly The undisputed king of the cornball concept Kevin Costner has an uncanny aptitude for gravitating toward the dopiest projects in sight but this time hes outdone himself. A Chicago doctor in charge of emergency services hes been traumatized by the loss of his saintly wife whos died on a medical mission to Venezuela; convinced that shes trying to speak to him through various near-death patients he awaits the confirmation of his mystic theories that only bad movies can bring. The clunky script is by David Seltzer Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson and someone at Universal must have decided the ideal director for such a delicate topic was Tom Shadyac best known for the inimitable fart jokes of Ace Ventura Pet Detective and Eddie Murphys The Nutty Professor. The secondary cast includes such talented hands as Linda Hunt and Kathy Bates who labor admirably but cant save the patient. 103 min.

Costner looks glum as bereaved husband Dr Joe Darrow. His saintly wife Emily was killed in an accident while working for the Red Cross in Venezuela and to the alarm of friends and colleagues Joe grows convinced shes trying to contact him from the beyond. The title refers to an insect-shaped birthmark on Emilys shoulder (pointedly shown in flashback) and to her knick-knacks and dragonfly paraphernalia which spookily begin to hurl themselves off shelves. Emily was were told a kindly loving soul but you wouldnt know it from her attempts to contact Joe from the spirit world. Shadyac resorts to the vernacular of the horror genre to create suspense leading to an unholy blend of Ghosts mawkish pan-dimensional romance and Exorcist-style shock tactics. The surprise ending is as predictable as it is a long time coming.

One of the more stupidly misleading advertising campaigns in recent memory may clip the commercial wings of ""Dragonfly"" a fitfully affecting supernatural romance that inexplicably is being sold in trailers and TV spots as some kind of spooky-scary blood-and-thunder ghost story. Ads appear designed to repel target aud of youngish to middle age femmes. Trouble is genre aficionados will quickly spread the word that pic doesnt live up (or down) to expectations. Favorable word of mouth could possibly extend theatrical run but a fast-forward to homevid is more likely. Drama begins on an arresting note of urgency as Chicago ER doc Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner) frantically scrambles to reach a Venezuelan ""hellhole"" (as he describes it to an airline ticket clerk) where his physician wife Emily (Susanna Thompson) is doing medico work among native tribespeople. Due to fuzzily explained political upheavals the hole suddenly has become appreciably more hellish and Joe wants to get his wife out of harms way. Aud might reasonably wonder why the very pregnant Emily -- shes at least in her second trimester possibly her third -- would risk placing herself in even a lukewarm hellhole in the first place but never mind. The question becomes moot when an evacuation bus plunges off a jungle mountainside and into a remote river. Emily and all other passengers are presumed dead. Six months later Joe remains devastated by his loss. He tries to numb the pain by working long hours in the emergency room much to the distress of his cheery next-door neighbor (Kathy Bates) and the dour hospital administrator (Joe Morton). More or less ordered by latter to take a long vacation Joe nonetheless sticks around to check on his wifes former patients in the pediatric oncology ward. Best known for his broad comedies (""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"") and shameless schmaltz (""Patch Adams"") director Tom Shadyac shows surprising restraint as he slowly lays groundwork for plots gradual detour into ""Twilight Zone"" territory. Early on aud learns the title refers to both a distinctive birthmark on Emilys shoulder and the design on most of her favorite tchotchkes. Late one night Joe is seriously rattled when a dragonfly-emblazoned paperweight mysteriously crashes from his bedside table. Back at the hospital hes again unsettled by Jeffrey (Robert Bailey Jr.) a young patient who seems to speak with Emilys voice during a near-death experience. After being revived Jeffrey claims to have ""seen"" Emily. More important the boy claims Emily wants to send Joe some kind of message. Joe is mystified by the strange design -- two wiggly intersecting lines -- repeatedly drawn by Jeffrey and another young patient after their alleged otherworldly congress with Emily. So he seeks advice from an expert Sister Madeline (Linda Hunt) a former hospital employee who was fired after attracting too much publicity for investigating near-death experiences. Unfortunately Sister Madeline can provide only vague suggestions not concrete answers. The truth is out there but finding it may require a return trip to Joes least favorite locale. ""Dragonfly"" works best when Shadyac sticks to generating suspense through allusions and ambiguities teasing aud with hints that Joe may be suffering guilt-fueled hallucinations. Around the midway point however screenwriters David Seltzer Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson raise the ante with ghostly apparitions buzzing dragonflies flickering light bulbs and other cheesy scare tactics. Shadyacs literal-minded approach underscores the obviousness and much worse triggers too many questions that cant be answered. For instance If Emilys ghost can take a direct approach without using a middle man -- that is if she can smear wiggly intersecting lines onto kitchen windows and into clumps of dirt -- why doesnt she simply write a note or draw a map for her distraught husband? Costners earnest performance is a major plus for ""Dragonfly"" keeping the pic grounded in some semblance of reality even as it becomes progressively more fantastical. Bates provides a nice dose of common-sense skepticism laced with heartfelt empathy. Newcomer Bailey makes an appealing impression despite a cheap-shock moment that calls for him to appear bug-eyed and maybe demonically possessed. Other members of the unusually strong supporting cast -- including Ron Rifkin as Joes physician friend and Matt Craven as another buddy -- are mostly underutilized. Lenser Dean Semler does more than his share to enhance the overall mood of not-so-quiet dread. Scenes set in Amazon jungle actually were filmed in Kauai but auds likely wont be able to tell one photogenic hellhole from another. Closing credits are accompanied by a shrill pop-rock tune that dissipates much of the goodwill generated by predictable but emotionally satisfying conclusion.

"Dances With Dragonflies washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Dances With Dragonflies Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 22 2002 ""Dragonfly"" is touchy-feely-creepy-icky. Its essentially an endorsement of a generic nondenominational afterlife - Heaven without brand names - from the noted theological commentator and spiritual adviser Kevin Costner as abetted by the director of ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective."" As for Tom Shadyac the director hes no stranger to shame. His last indiscretion was ""Patch Adams"" which should end all argument. Costner on the other hand appears to be seeking to reposition himself as a more sensitive older fellow as opposed to the clever schemers and butt-kickers he played in his early career but for whom he is now chronologically unsuited. Still going the soft route isnt all its cracked up to be; youd be hard-pressed to name a major star who has picked two such recent dogs as ""Message in a Bottle"" and now ""Dragonfly."" Is this a career or a death wish? His voice throbbing with the phlegm of grief his eyes constantly welling with liquid his Adams apple atwitch with tremors of misery Costner plays a bereaved doctor who becomes convinced that his recently (and tragically) departed wife is trying to reach him from beyond the vale. In their idealized-in-flashback pre-trauma life he was Dr. Joe Darrow the star head of emergency medicine at a notable Chicago hospital; she was Dr. Emily Darrow (Susanna Thompson) the star pediatric oncologist. They lived in a big house in Evanston - thereby incidentally violating a key movie rule It is impossible to empathize with people in big houses unless those people are named Heathcliff. The two docs went for long dewy walks in nature where they enjoyed each others beauty wisdom and serenity. In the hospital he heroically shouted ""STAT"" while she held the hands of dying youths. But she had a higher calling She rushed off to a war zone in South America where pediatric oncologists are presumably in much demand while he the trauma expert languished back in Evanston. When she is killed in a bus accident fleeing for the border in the rain he is shattered. Shattered? Man he is wiped out deep-sixed eighty-sixed piled on hit out of bounds blindsided called out on strikes sent to the showers. The judges only give him a 5.1 for presentation. Youre thinking after minute 38 on this line like we get the point already. Hes surly curt bitter messy and unprofessional. He chooses to treat an accident victim instead of a suicide attempt down in the ER because he has no use for death. Yes Mark it well. Kevin Costner is against death. He thinks its a Bad Thing. But then the movie lurches into its queasiest and most disturbing aspect. Wandering the pediatric oncology ward one night in search of memories of the good old days he encounters a child just flat-lined - dead for you laypeople - who miraculously comes back to life to give Dr. Kevin a message in the form of a squiggly cruciform image. For 40 minutes thats the movie Costners Dr. Joe wandering this labyrinth of perishing children not in hopes of helping them but in hopes of helping himself. He wants something from them and when the nurses and hospital administrators quite rightly seek to drive this nut case away he carries on as if some special entitlement had been snatched from him. Its a little creepy actually; the kids are dying hes acting. From the grotesque the movie enters its climactic phase which is merely ridiculous. Now based on the clue of the squiggly cruciform figure and some film the late wife evidently sent from combat-haunted South America to the local Evanston InstaPhoto Booth in the moments before her death hes back to the remote jungles. There he responds to all impediments to his progress in the following way He goes WAAAAAAAAAAAA Really. You think Im making this up. But he keeps pulling away from people and running off in search of whatever message awaits him at the end of - I mislead you not - the rainbow. ""Dragonfly"" which probably was hatched by screenwriters watching ""The Sixth Sense"" on methamphetamines isnt much removed from the tacky little TV show ""Crossing Over"" where a charlatan pretends to deliver messages from beyond to those left behind interrupted now and again by commercial messages from Popeils Pocket Fisherman and the latest in electronic ab reduction. Theres no doubt it will comfort some for even the greasiest of con men have a beguiling way about them. Folks go to church. Its better for you and its where spiritual messages can be taken seriously. DRAGONFLY (PG-13 105 minutes) - contains mild anger and intense scenes of children in peril. At area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - Dragonfly merely flutters with suspense Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/22/2002 - Updated 0932 AM ET Dragonfly merely flutters with suspense By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Dragonfly (out of four) Stars Kevin Costner Susanna Thompson Kathy Bates Jacob Vargas Director Tom Shadyac Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for thematic material and sensuality When Kevin Costner goes into sensitive-guy mode beware. There wasnt a wet eye in the house for his sappy Message in a Bottle a few years back but he insists on revisiting the grieving widower in the sentimental thriller. (Now theres a fun hybrid.) In Dragonfly Costner plays an emergency room doctor whose oncologist wife (Susanna Thompson) dies during a Red Cross mission in Venezuela. He loved her madly. She loved dragonflies. Read more below Video Dragonfly trailer ""They were sort of her thing like a personal totem"" Costner says after her death. ""Now I see them everywhere."" They tap on his windows at odd hours; his wifes dragonfly curios hurtle across rooms and its no coincidence. Apparently his departed wife wants desperately to communicate with him. While the themes sound intriguing the movie lacks the necessary clarity of vision. Its as if director Tom Shadyac (The Nutty Professor Patch Adams) couldnt decide whether to make a supernatural thriller or a spiritual odyssey. Costners character is a cynic with no use for notions of an afterlife and he refuses to acknowledge the depth of his grief. His quiet sadness is supposed to provoke sympathy but he is so somber and wooden we are unmoved. His wifes attempts to reach him are intended to be spooky but come off as only mildly eerie. Those incessant dragonflies dont so much unsettle as irritate. And when the couples pet bird exhibits un-parrot-like behavior its more laughable than creepy. Still Dragonfly does have a few thrilling moments and Costner eventually does start to suspend his disbelief and do what he does best take action. But that doesnt come till the final third. Only then are there glimpses of the star quality that turned heads 15 years ago in No Way Out. Thats too late to save Dragonfly and not enough to give Costners clipped career fresh wings.

""Dragonfly""  With Kevin Costner Joe Morton Ron Rifkin Linda Hunt Susanna Thompson Kathy Bates. Directed by Tom Shadyac from a screenplay by David Seltzer Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic material and mild sensuality. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article I suppose we have ""The Sixth Sense"" to thank for ""Dragonfly"" a gooey thriller about whether the dead can still walk among us or knock paperweights off tables or speak to us through the mouths of bright-eyed terminally ill children. Except that where ""The Sixth Sense"" radiated intelligence and style ""Dragonfly"" exudes a certain whiff of desperation. Director Tom Shadyac (he of the dreadful 1998 tearjerker ""Patch Adams"") once again uses dying children to add cheap poignancy to his story. This time its Dr. Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner) a widower who becomes convinced that his dead wife Emily (Susanna Thompson) is trying to contact him -- through her former patients on the pediatric oncology ward of the Chicago hospital where they both worked. Emily alas isnt really a character -- she meets her demise before the opening credits roll in a bus accident in Venezuela where shes working for the Red Cross. And Costner whose laconic charm is best-suited to low-key comedy (those who roll their eyes when Costner is mentioned should just watch ""Bull Durham"" or ""Tin Cup"" again) simply isnt sufficiently skilled as an actor to convey grief and loss. His voice has little range; his handsome face seems set in just two or three expressions. Kevin Costner plays a doctor who becomes convinced his dead wife is trying to contact him. But Costners only part of the problem. The screenplay is credited to three writers all of whom have a tendency to load their sentences with unnecessary exposition like overstuffed suitcases for a very short journey. We learn awkwardly for example that Joes family are all doctors that Joes neighbor Miriam is a law professor and that Emily was a vegetarian. None of this matters in the slightest. And Shadyac allows the film to wander all over the place before it goes somewhere lingering on odd moments with suicidal hospital patients (a priest appears suddenly to unintentionally comic effect) or at home with Joe and his pet bird. At times he seems to want to make the film a thriller -- there are a few standard-issue scares -- but ultimately its more of an inspirational drama and a rather uninspired one at that. A final note Universal the studio thats releasing ""Dragonfly"" distributed a note to critics after the preview screening requesting that reviews not reveal key details of the plot including one particular development that is evident from the first scenes of the film. Well OK Ill keep it to myself -- but obviously the studios worried that if audiences have any more time to ponder this particular plot angle (its not complicated) wed figure out what ultimately happens. (Which I think most of us did anyway long before Joes final revelation.) Wouldnt it be better next time Universal to just make the screenplay a little smarter?

Dr. Joe Darrow (Kevin Costner) believes that his deceased wife may be trying to communicate with him. Photo HANDOUT Meandering Dragonfly / Inert thriller offers good Costner performance 1 / 1 Back to Gallery DRAGONFLY Drama. Starring Kevin Costner Kathy Bates and Susanna Thompson. Directed by Tom Shadyac. (PG-13. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Dragonfly"" is about a widower with a lot to grieve about. His late wife was not only beautiful and sexy but also brilliant and saintly a pediatric oncologist who wore bunny ears at hospital Christmas parties and did charity work in Venezuela. He has photos of her all over the house and apparently she never took a bad picture -- standing next to a waterfall posing with a tropical bird. The husband cant get over her and the movie does everything to make sure we dont either. After the wife is killed in the first scene -- in a freak bus accident -- it becomes impossible to imagine how this fellow is supposed to recover even if he is played by Kevin Costner. Thats the significance of ""Dragonfly."" This otherwise routine effort puts us right there on the ground floor of a mans grief. Its as if suddenly he has 100-pound weights on his legs and he has to climb the stairs. Every day. Why bother? The movie doesnt take the usual romantic approach to depicting grief. When he goes into the house the soundtrack stops. Its quiet in there. Costner has a good role. Hes not mired in his usual type -- a stammering neo-Gary Cooper after sensitivity training -- but plays a man with a hard edge an emergency room doctor used to making life-and-death decisions. To see him in an early scene barking orders as injured patients come pouring through the hospital doors is like seeing Costner unbound. Someone brings in an attempted suicide and he passes her off on another doctor. ""Today were only interested in treating people who want to live"" he says. Its a hint of what could be a promising direction for this actor. He doesnt have to be a sweet guy. On two occasions in ""Dragonfly"" well-meaning people tell him that he needs to take time to grieve and a dangerous look crosses his face as if he might start breaking things. Costner was always good at thinking on camera and here his thoughts are often in conflict making for complex and true moments. His character takes some comfort in being around friends and yet cant stand them -- they cant possibly be as busted up as he is. The only person he can really talk to is his next-door neighbor (Kathy Bates) a lesbian whose lover has died. ""Dragonfly"" has elements of either a supernatural or psychological thriller depending on the source of the messages the dead wife seems to be sending her husband. Kids who have had near-death experiences tell him that theyve seen her but the kids could be playing with him. He also believes that objects including a dragonfly paperweight are moving themselves around his house. The first hint that the movie is about to go sour comes about a third of the way in when on four occasions someone comments on the doctors bald spot. Costner may not be the most hirsute movie star around -- hes thinning slightly in front -- but he doesnt have even an intimation of a bald spot. They should have cut his hair or cut the jokes. The movies more serious problem is that its marriage of two genres -- romantic drama and eerie thriller -- doesnt quite come off. At times it tries to be scary in the manner of ""The Sixth Sense"" but the thrills fall flat. Our hero is not seeing ""dead people."" At worst hes seeing his dead wife and how scary could that be? If anything thats good news. The thriller is only thrilling enough to kill the movies romantic mood while the romance just makes ""Dragonfly"" seem meandering and inert. Yet as an etching of an emotion and a vehicle for Costner the movie makes a case for itself. Advisory The subject matter may alarm children.

Otherwise he might as well have had Bruce Willis leading him around by the hand. Director Tom Shadyac whos also responsible for such efforts as ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" (1994) and ""Patch Adams"" (1998) is obviously trying to duplicate the unnerving tone of M. Night Shyamalans brilliant 1999 feature ""The Sixth Sense."" But Shyamalan is a virtuoso whose films are idiosyncratic symphonies of spiritual loss and rediscovery. Shadyac on the other hand sometimes points his camera at Jim Carrey so he gets to make more movies. One of these things to say the least is not like the other. Shyamalans low-key power is unique in modern commercial filmmaking so its not really Shadyacs fault that he cant reproduce it. He should however have recognized that you need to do more than lap-dissolve between slow-moving premonitions to put viewers on the edges of their seats. Bugged by loss Costner plays Joe Darrow head of the emergency room at Chicago Memorial Hospital. In a quick prologue we see what leads to the funk that will overwhelm Joe for the rest of the picture. During a mission of mercy in the jungles of Venezuela his doctor wife Emily (Susanna Thompson) is killed while riding a bus thats caught in a mudslide.

Unfortunately her communications are so hard to decipher that he starts to bug out. Is this supernatural tale throwaway comfort for a plague year? Or is it an opportunistic extension of the spiritualist parlor game Crossing Over With John Edward? Either way its dully preposterous.
