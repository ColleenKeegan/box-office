Glen Wilson/Universal Pictures Director Nicholas StollerGenre Romantic ComedyRunning Time 112 minutes Watch a Clip With pratfalls yucks a crying jag and what is starting to seem like the requisite flash of nudity Jason Segel becomes this years adorably hapless movie schlub. Segel was an early Freak (as opposed to a Geek) in Judd Apatows unofficial rep company and in penning a starring vehicle for himself hes hewn closely to the formula of bawdy sweetness and cuddly raunch that worked for his Knocked Up/Superbad/Virgin antecedents. This time the story centers on a bad breakup made worse Segels TV composer the dumpee has fled to a Hawaiian hotel to recuperate only to find that the dumper (Kristen Bells TV-star title character) and her new rock-star lover (Russell Brand) have picked the same spot. Mortification ensues. Happily theres a pretty hotel receptionist (Rachel Jansen) to take pity on Segel and a few random Apatovians (surfing instructor Paul Rudd songwriting waiter Jonah Hill) to help with the comic heavy lifting. First-time director Nicholas Stoller doesnt do anything particularly creative with the formula but he keeps Segel zipping brightly from one humiliation to the next. And the star remains engaging even during the last half-hour when the films bubbly premise starts to go a little flat.

Yet neatness doesnt count for everything in this cheerful shambles which was written by Mr. Segel and directed by Nicholas Stoller. (Cheerful and insistently raunchy one of its signal distinctions if you can call it that is a succession of frontal-nudity shots that use the heros genitals as a sort of marketing device.) Peter grows from a crude cartoon into a flesh-and-blood nebbish with a shot at becoming a man. The script which deposits a feather-light dusting of parody on the pleasure seekers of its Hawaiian setting keeps lurching into hilarious free-associative riffs. Least forgettable of all Mila Kunis lights up the screen as a smart slightly screwy girl who threatens to heal the heros heart. A hotel in Hawaii is Peters vacation destination of choice after his break-up. The scripts plot twist of choice has Sarah a TV star played by Kristen Bell ensconced in the same hotel with her new squeeze a fatuous British rock star played quite charmingly by Russell Brand. This is a first feature for both the writer and director -- theyre members of the loosely organized repertory company run by Judd Apatow the man behind such megahits as ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" -- and they keep their respective debuts free from contamination by subtlety. The movie looks like ""The Love Boat"" run aground -- lots of ludicrous locals. Peter wallows in repetitive grief while his ex and her rocker revel in each other next door. Halfway through however I realized that Id lost most of my standards maybe under my seat and was enjoying the erratic evolution of the nonsense. Thats mainly a tribute to Jason Segels perseverance as a performer and to Mila Kuniss fresh beauty and focused energy. (I havent forgotten Kristen Bell; its just that shes less interesting in a much less interesting role.) Mr. Segel has bleary Rodney Dangerfield eyes and a doughy face that looks older than it looks. Hes able to operate on the margins of morose yet stay within the bounds of broad comedy. Ms. Kunis a petite brunette plays Rachel a hotel receptionist by day and a party girl by night (and day) with a sparkling smile a seductive voice that can sharpen to a rasp and a quick wit that suggests withheld knowledge. Good for her in a sex farce that lets so much hang out. The Flight of the Red Balloon Lets not make too much of the big round character on a string in ""The Flight of the Red Balloon."" The Taiwanese filmmaker Hsiao-hsien Hou took inspiration for this lovely leisurely evocation of daily life in contemporary Paris from ""The Red Balloon"" Albert Lamorisses childrens classic that was released in 1956 yet never made it to videotape and is only now coming to DVD (as noted at the end of this column) in its full glory. The new film in subtitled French starts as the old one does with a little boy -- this one Simon is played by Simon Iteanu -- discovering a red balloon floating near him. True to its tradition the balloon keeps checking in on the boy whether or not Simon knows it. But the story -- in which little happens while much is seen and felt -- concerns Simons frazzled mother Suzanne whos played brilliantly by Juliette Binoche; his new Chinese nanny a serene film-school student named and played by Fang Song and the boys earnest astute efforts to decode adult life. At the same time lets not make too little of the balloons presence even though it is just a presence rather than an integral part of the film. What Mr. Hou has done is borrow power and some gentle intimations of a state of grace from one of the most enchanting images in movie history. For those of us whove loved ""The Red Balloon"" over the years and decades its stirring to see its descendant -- its ascendant descendant -- hovering over the lives of Simon and those around him. The balloon lends weight in its lighter-than-air fashion to Suzannes anguish over love and money; to a Chinese puppet theater where she does all the voices for a play about epic passion; to a blind piano tuners recital of contentment; to a furniture movers medical monologue and to Simons soaring delight with the world. The balloon serves as a benediction. The Life Before Her Eyes Consider this more a consumer warning than a movie review ""The Life Before Her Eyes"" will draw you in then intrigue you then bore you then bewilder you then make you crazy with its incessant flashbacks and flash forwards and finally leave you feeling like the victim of a fraud. Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood are adult and adolescent versions of the same person Diana who as a high school student must plead for her life during a Columbine-style shooting. The director Vadim Perelman and the writer Emil Stern (who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Laura Kasischke) tell Dianas tormented tale through a series of intricately interlocked pieces. The intricacy is worse than pretentious though the film amounts to a veritable archive of pretentiousness; its idiotic given the nature of the secret thats revealed at the end. Far be it from me to blow that secret but Ill tell you another one. During the screening I suffered several flash forwards of my own. They all had to do with the movie ending and me going home. Morgensterns DVD Tip ENLARGE The Red Balloon (1956) This film almost silent and only 34 minutes long is a singular treasure of world cinema. Shot in the Menilmontant section of Paris its a fable about the friendship of a boy and his magic balloon though its also about the casual cruelty of children and the power of belief. The film has been magically restored in a DVD version released by Janus Films in conjunction with the Criterion Collection that goes on sale April 29.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Twice in the course of Forgetting Sarah Marshall its amusingly woebegone protagonist Peter Bretter (Jason Segel who also wrote the screenplay) appears stark naked his frontalia fully if briefly on view. The Judd Apatow comedy conglomerate which is responsible for every aspect of the picture has caused some buzz by striking brave poses about the near-Constitutional right of actors to display the family jewels when the spirit moves them. Donat know about that. I am not certain that the sight of Segalas thingy adds greatly to the gaiety of nations. And itas possible that this hoo-ha will distract us from the fact that this is not a bad little comedy. People tend to focus on the raunchy premises of Apatowas work (he produced the film and Segel director Nicholas Stoller and some of the actors are veteran collaborators) while ignoring the qualities that made movies like The 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked Up and Superbad such mighty hits which is a certain wistfulness and romantic rue. Thatas the case with Sarah in which Peter finds himself devastated by the departure of his longtime girlfriend (Kristen Bell) for another man. He (and we) will soon discover that her best acting is the real-life kind wherein she fairly convincing portrays a nice and sympathetic young woman when in fact sheas hiding an icily ambitious nature under that mask. Before that happens we have the pleasure of watching Peter crack up -- canat work (heas a television composer) canat sleep canat eat canat tidy up his apartment. Off he goes to a resort in Hawaii doing his best to forget his troubles. Naturally Sarah is shacked up there with Peteras replacement a hirsute laid-back and slyly egomaniacal rock star named Aldous who is played with an oddly insinuating charm by British comic Russell Brand. Peter attempts to learn surfing drinks to excess and spies clumsily on the lovers. He has quite a lot on his plate -- so much so that he for a long time ignores a very tempting side dish a hotel receptionist named Rachel (the lovely Mila Kunis) who has dropped out of mainland striving. Segel has written himself a good part as the amiable emotionally underdeveloped and not exactly buff Peter and as an actor he finds the right line for this doofus to tread. He edges up to the farcical but then backs off to more plausible sorts of confusion. He allows you feel for the guy. Most of us at one time or another have been jilted and tried to struggle back from despair and that grounds this comedy in a certain reality which is not allowed to become oppressive. It seems to me that the success of Apatow and company derives from the fact that though their premises offer a lot of vulgar promise they rarely deliver on that potential full-bore. What theyare really doing most of the time is offering twists and updates on the classic romantic comedy formulas making them acceptable to todayas much younger movie audiences. For example Forgetting Sarah Marshall seems to be what the academics like to call a aComedy of Remarriage.a You know -- fairly mature couple splits up endures some feckless romantic misadventures then get more happily reconnected in the final reel. You expect that to happen with these kids. But it doesnat. Instead something thatas equally civilized but a little less formulaic develops something that is obviously appealing to the optimism and inexperience of a young audience occurs. This is a fairly low-keyed comedy but a grown-up dropping in on it can appreciate its lack of frenzy its fundamental good nature as easily as its core audience will. It isnat exactly a gem but as zircons go itall do.

Starring Jason Segel Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis. Directed by Nicholas Stoller. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jason Segel did the best favor an actor can do for himself He wrote a funny screenplay with an ideal role for you-know-who and then he got really lucky on the timing. Segels breakthrough movie ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" deserves to ride the wave of the latest hottest micro-trend in pictures the romantic comedy for guys. This is what Judd Apatow who produced ""Sarah Marshall"" has brought to movies in the past few years ""40-Year-Old Virgin""? For guys. ""Knocked Up""? Face it It was a guy movie. So was ""Superbad."" These movies take a genre usually pitched to a female audience but then add sex a touch of gross-out humor and - most important - a healthy dose of male vulnerability. Like its predecessors ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is a smart comedy that trades on social embarrassment and shows love from the standpoint of male insecurity. It cuts uncomfortably close to real life. Thats what makes it funny. After all behind the placid facade of most men theres usually a Sarah Marshall who witnessed the pathetic breakup scene the regrettable episode of weeping or some other self-inflicted emasculation. Our heros girlfriend dumps him in the first scene of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and his misery and heartache while comically extreme is not far removed from the real thing. Segel is like the Ghost of Breakups Past and the only response for anyone who has ever been there is to recognize that state squirm a little and then crack up laughing. But will women find this equally amusing? Thats the question. Peter (Segel) is a musician with a respectable job as the composer for a TV show but hes become complacent and when hes not working hes parked in front of the TV set like some Platonic ideal of a guy about to get dumped. His girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell) is a famous TV actress the star of the show and the moment of their breakup gives us one of the great comic tableaus of 2008 Shes impeccably dressed and he happens to be nude. (Its the middle of the day and hes not yet dressed.) Within a minute he looks like a sobbing quivering white whale a blubbering heap of blubber. That tableau comes pretty close to the familiar nightmare of going out in public without wearing clothes and thats how deep the embarrassment cuts in this movie - to the most basic core humiliations possible. Most of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" takes place in Hawaii where the humiliations continue. Peter goes there to forget only to find that Sarah is at the same hotel with her new boyfriend - an English rock star of course. Segels previous work has been confined to small roles in movies in which I never noticed him and to better roles on TV shows that Ive never seen but he has a quality in this film characteristic of a lot of actors whove gone on to major success He seems familiar already as if hes always been there. In addition he shows expert timing in this film as well as a willingness to put himself on the line emotionally and physically. Kristen Bell does as much as she can with the somewhat thankless role as Sarah and Mila Kunis is winning as the radiantly reasonable hotel clerk who takes pity on poor Peter. Two members of the Apatow stock company appear in smaller roles Paul Rudd as a mentally burnt-out surf instructor and Jonah Hill as the hotel waiter. The movies major surprise is Russell Brand as Aldous the rock star. Instead of a comic abstraction Aldous is presented with some complexity and sympathy and hes played to comic perfection by Brand whos a welcome discovery. If theres anything bad to be said about ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" its nothing about the movie itself but rather about the notion of male-oriented romantic comedies in general. The fact that Aldous is presented with more depth than any of the women is symptomatic. Right now in America all the active genres cater to a male audience action sci-fi adventure crime etc. If romantic comedy goes that way too our actresses may have to emigrate to Europe to find a decent role. -- Advisory Sex talk sexual situations and male frontal nudity.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall. (R) Universal (111 min.) Directed by Nicholas Stoller. With Jason Segel Mila Kunis Kristen Bell. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS The producer is making a comeback. He was supposed to disappear along with the studio system; the future was supposed to belong to directors and stars. But slowly moguls have made a return. Most Joel Silver movies bear his mark whether hes working with the brothers Coen or Wachowski; Steven Spielberg productions are always somehow Spielbergian. And over the last two years Judd Apatow has joined their ranks. He doesnt always hit (his last release ""Drillbit Taylor"" felt like a placeholder). And some of his trademarks are getting tired (the Jonah Hill cameo the comic male nudity the graphic sex jokes the schlubby male hero who somehow attracts the extremely pretty heroine). Most of his films are badly edited and frankly overlong. But when you compare them with something like ""The Heartbreak Kid"" you see his talent. That movie had a lot in common with the current ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" -- a Hawaiian setting lots of laid-back local humor a comic hero caught between two beautiful women a lot of frantic calls home for advice. The crucial difference of course was that ""The Heartbreak Kid"" wasnt funny. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is. The story begins when Peter a not-particularly-in-demand composer gets dumped by Sarah his TV-star girlfriend. Unable to get her out of his mind -- even after copious helpings of junk food crying jags and meaningless sex -- he finally listens to advice and goes on a South Pacific vacation. And to the same hotel where much to his horror Sarah and her new boyfriend have booked a room. Screenwriter Jason Segel plays Peter and while he fits the mold of most Apatow heroes -- curly-haired pale and doughy -- he also has their humor. Kristen Bell is forgettably cookie-cutter pert as Sarah -- although honestly playing a dim TV star she probably should be -- but Mila Kunis is unfussy and direct as a potential Peter girlfriend. The supporting cast is solid. Particularly committed is British comic Russell Brand as Sarahs new beau an incredibly conceited British rock star. And another Apatow stalwart Paul Rudd again proves his most-valuable-player status by showing up as a beatifically clueless surfer. The good thing (""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"") about an Apatow production us that there are always a lot of jokes; the bad thing (""Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story"") is that theyre not always good ones. (A subplot here about a couple of devout Christians on their honeymoon makes its too easy point in a minute then keeps returning for more.) But then discipline is not one of the Apatow trademarks nor is pushing the people who work for him. Director Nicholas Stoller and Segel are both veterans of Apatows various TV projects; its possible they could have turned in more polished big-screen work with a little more encouragement or pressure. And yet Segel is very likable as Peter (and if you squint a bit almost attractive) Kunis is pleasant Rudd is terrific and the scenes involving Peters passion project (imagine ""Avenue Q"" but with vampires) are absolutely giddy. Yes like most of Apatows productions -- heck most of his heroes -- ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is big and sloppy and too willing to settle for being just good enough But like them too its funny. And it grows on you. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations substance abuse and violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Instead of the usual flabby guys running around in their underwear writer-star Jason Segel ups the ante by showing off the full monty in several scenes. This film is so funny it may be beside the point to complain that as in many Apatow productions the writing and direction are still in something of a state of arrested development. Segels Peter drops his towel - and refuses to cover up his uh peter as his girlfriend Sarah (Kristen Bell) proceeds to break up with him. In a role reversal of your usual romantic comedy Peter - a composer of hackneyed musical themes for the ""CSI"" knockoff Sarah stars in - cries a lot. And his misery only gets worse when he books an ill-timed Hawaiian getaway. Sarah and her new boyfriend a British rocker named Aldous (Russell Brand) are athletically cavorting in the room next door. That leaves Peter to drown his sorrows at the bar with a confused newlywed (Jack McBrayer) - and to nearly literally drown under the dubious tutelage of a stoner surfboard instructor (a very funny Paul Rudd). Its pretty obvious that Peter is eventually going to notice Sarah (like so many characters in the phallocentric Apatow-iverse) is an emasculating bitch and that he really should be interested in that nice Rachel (Mila Kunis) at the reservations desk. Somehow this simple story which ought to take no more than 90 minutes clocks in at nearly two hours. Debuting director Nicholas Stoller another of Apatows TV cronies has to work in cameos by other members of the stock company including Jonah Hill and Jason Bateman. And this being a Universal Pictures release there are many shameless production placements especially on behalf of sister-company NBC. Segel perhaps best known for his role on ""How I Met Your Mother"" has a flair for physical comedy and there is some very funny stuff in his supposedly autobiographical script even if it seems like a first draft. Most of the best lines go to Brand a veteran British comedian who steals the flick and turns out to be its most appealing character. Even Stollers flaccid direction - abetted by haphazard editing - cant seriously damage the charming final sequence Peters puppet-musical version of ""Dracula."" Unlike its Apatovian predecessors - ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" - ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" will probably be remembered primarily for its stars nude scenes. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next HEROES HEROES Read Next HEROES HEROES Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 18870 How Hillary blew her big moment 11517 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7722 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday June 4 2008 332 PM Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Romantic comedy about a heartbroken slacker who cant escape his ex-girlfriend. With Jason Segel Kristen Bell. Director Nicholas Stoller (142). R Sexuality nudity language. At area theaters. We know actors are trained to let it all hang out but Jason Segel takes naked vulnerability to new levels in Nicholas Stollers likable debut ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" And were not just talking about that already-infamous opening scene in which he stands completely unclothed long enough to challenge the movies very generous R rating.As fans of ""Freaks and Geeks"" know Segel is a master in the art of humiliation and its been a long time since weve seen anyone debase himself so thoroughly for our amusement. Segel plays Peter an uninspired composer whos stunned when his girlfriend a TV actress named Sarah (Kristen Bell) breaks up with him. A month later the lovelorn Peter still cant get Sarah out of his head so when he plans a solo vacation he automatically chooses her favorite Hawaiian resort. Unfortunately she has arrived that very week with her new rock star boyfriend (Russell Brand) in tow. At first Peter dines alone sleeps alone and cries alone while watching Sarah have the time of her life. Eventually however the Hawaiian sun - and a truckload of pina coladas - start to work their magic. And when Peter feels ready to rejoin the outside world again the hotels gorgeous concierge (Mila Kunis) just happens to be waiting. While Stoller never quite gets a handle on Segels giddy script hes got sturdy guidance in Hollywoods reigning workaholic producer Judd Apatow. Thats not entirely a good thing; much of the movie feels awfully familiar from Apatows reliable themes (so many boys so scared of girls) to his characteristic in-your-face humor (though when Segel drops his towel the camera is nowhere near his face). Apatow regulars like Paul Rudd Jonah Hill and Bill Hader contribute droll turns but its actually a newcomer who makes the strongest impression. British comedian Brand is so hilarious as a self-obsessed celebrity that he becomes - with all due respect to Segel - the one element of ""Sarah Marshall"" that is truly unforgettable. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Forgetting Sarah Marshall  (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Forgetting Sarah Marshall  (R) The real meat of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is its series of fine comic appearances. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald The latest comedy from Judd Apatow and his band of merry men is about an essentially nice but loserish guy who must emerge from his self-imposed adolescence to find happiness. Apatow who produced the film has mastered this story reinventing and perfecting it with unforgettable ribald humor in The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up. (The boys of Superbad were too young to hit this time-to-grow-up stumbling block but give them time.) Whats surprising though is how fresh Forgetting Sarah Marshall feels even when you think you know whats coming. The movie isnt quite so polished as Virgin or Knocked Up but its terrifically funny and for a few brief moments poignant. Its success lies squarely in the hands of screenwriter and star Jason Segel who appears on the sitcom How I Met Your Mother has been an Apatow ensemble member since the heady days of Freaks and Geeks and apparently has no fear whatsoever. Segel plays Peter a gawky musician who composes moody accompaniment to a CSI-type TV show that stars his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell of Veronica Mars). In his spare time he loafs around in sweatpants watches bad TV and works on his Dracula puppet musical (a hobby that pays off handsomely in the end). Segel proves adept at satire from the start bashing cheesy David Caruso one-liners and mannerisms and he quickly displays an aptitude for the brutally awkward moment In a scene so thunderously agonizing it belongs on a Ricky Gervais box set Sarah dumps Peter while he is naked. The moment also marks a feminist comic triumph of sorts male nudity as an object of ridicule. Peter tries to shake off depression by traveling to a posh resort in Hawaii but discovers that Sarah and her new utterly cool rock-star beau (the hilarious Russell Brand) are also vacationing there. Even Rachel a pretty customer-service rep (Mila Kunis That 70s Show) cant push Sarah from his mind. How Peter finally moves on matters but the real meat of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a series of fine comic appearances Paul Rudd the clown prince of the Apatow supporting role as a dimwit surf instructor; Bill Heder (Saturday Night Live) as a well-meaning stepbrother who checks on Peter via computer; Jack McBrayer (30 Rock) as a flummoxed newlywed; Davon McDonald as a supportive bartender. The one gag that never quite works involves Jonah Hill (Superbad) as a fawning waiter; repetition only exposes this jokes weaknesses. Still Segal like Steve Carell and Seth Rogen before him negotiates the line between idiot and hero and as a writer he takes great chances. In one bold and brilliant scene of meta comedy Peter mocks Sarahs almost-straight-to-DVD film which shares characteristics of Bells real-life dog Pulse. Touches as savvy as that put Segel solidly in good company -- that of the master himself.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor April 18 2008 Save for later Saved Marshall law Heartbroken Peter (Jason Segel) finds himself at the same hotel as his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend. Courtesy of Glen Wilson/Universal Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The latest - I almost said ""this weeks"" - Judd Apatow production is an agglomeration of much that has come before. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" will be familiar to anyone who has seen ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" ""Superbad"" etc. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Familiarity in the movies does not always bring contempt. Sometimes it brings a sense of connoisseurship - if thats not too tony a word to use in connection with Team Apatow.Jason Segel who also wrote the script plays Peter Bretter a composer of incidental music for an awful but popular TV crime show starring his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Hes content to accompany her to premieres and blink at the flashbulbs that are not meant for him. Its a small price to pay for such a prize partner.When she breaks up with him he goes into a rolling funk that lands him in Hawaii for a spur-of-the-moment getaway in what turns out to be the same luxury hotel where Sarah and her new squeeze British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) are lustily carrying on. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Nicholas Stoller isnt really up to the split-second staging that this sort of farcical situation requires and many of the jokes are repetitive. Still theres a refreshing lackadaisicalness about the comedy that fits right into the gorgeous Hawaii locale. Stoller isnt mean-spirited in the way that the Farrelly brothers were in a similar set-up the dreadful remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid"" with Ben Stiller. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In heartbreak hotel Sarah Marshall is the girl next door Sarah isnt a harridan shes just confused and given Peters soppy sloppiness you cant entirely blame her for wanting to move on. Even Aldous who would normally be cast in a movie like this as the villain is a nice guy.Its often been the case in Apatow movies that although they generally feature goony slobs the women in them come across better than you might expect. Thats because theyve got the guys number. This takes the sting out of what otherwise resembles flat-out misogyny. In ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" Peter is teamed with a comely hotel clerk (Mila Kunis) who takes his mind off Sarah and she seems like a such a good match for him that the whole love-on-the-rebound thing seems pre-ordained. I wish the interplay between these two had been sharper; at times Stoller reaches for a gross-out gag just to keep the scenes moving along. And maybe its time to declare a moratorium on Hawaiian shirt jokes. But this is a hit-and-miss comedy in which the hits outnumber the misses.As is true of all Apatow productions one must be prepared for the usual quotient of off-color lewdness. (Lets just say that Jason Segel is not shy about showing off his birthday suit.) But more so than with the other Apatow films the down-and-dirty stuff is good-natured. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is ultimately forgettable but for most of the way its a pleasant little vacation of a movie. Rated R for sexual content language and some graphic nudity.

"Forgetting Sarah Marshall reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Forgetting Sarah Marshall reviewed. Forgetting Sarah Marshall reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 17 2008 541 PM Forgetting Sarah Marshall The school of Apatow reaches a new level of emotional nakedness. By Dana Stevens Jason Segel in Forgetting Sarah Marshall The two latest movies to come off the Judd Apatow assembly line have finally recognized a comic truth long known to women everywhere The unerect human penis is inherently funny. The biggest laughs in Walk Hard the Apatow-produced mock biopic that died an undeservedly quick death at the box office last year involved John C. Reillys debauched country singer phoning his wife from his hotel room as his nude bandmates strolled in and out of the frame flaccid wangers a-wavin. Apatows latest production Forgetting Sarah Marshall (Universal) directed by first-timer Nick Stoller opens and closes with scenes that have full-length shots of the films writer and star Jason Segel looking beseechingly into the camera as his wookerbill dangles wanly. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Baring the lead actors junk in the first five minutes isnt the only way in which Forgetting Sarah Marshall exposes its manhood. Segels character Peter Bretter is the most emotionally naked Apatovian hero yet. Peter doesnt bother to mask his insecurity with raunchy bravado like Seth Rogen in Knocked Up or the foulmouthed seniors of Superbad. From the moment hes dumped by his TV-star girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) his coping device consists mainly of frequent and copious weeping. The crying like the nudity is funny in itself--not because the audience is insensitive to Peters suffering but because his baby-bird vulnerability so thoroughly subverts our expectations of how a male romantic lead should behave. Advertisement After a few days of wallowing in self-pity and eating Froot Loops by the mixing bowl--the guy equivalent of ice cream straight from the carton--Peter decides to treat himself to a luxury vacation in Hawaii. But the resort he picks is a favorite of Sarahs as well and no sooner has Peter checked in than he finds himself face-to-face with his ex and her new boyfriend the sanctimonious British rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The setup is familiar but where Segels script takes things isnt. For the next hour or so Peter just sort of hangs around the Turtle Bay resort becoming a favorite of the hotel staff as hes tormented by the presence of the canoodling lovers. A gorgeous desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis) lets him stay in a 6000-a-night suite for free. A spaced-out surf instructor (Paul Rudd) offers Peter some useless Zen advice (""Do less"") while a needy maitred (Jonah Hill) takes pity on his single-guy status (""Man if I were you Id be so depressed.""). As Peter begins to emerge from his funk--on a date with Rachel he shyly confesses his dream of writing a ""rock opera about Dracula with puppets""--his nemeses the perfidious Sarah and the insufferable Aldous start to seem less evil. This middle section is a little loose and unstructured--scene by scene its nowhere near as gag-rich as say Knocked Up--but that very looseness allows for a level of character development thats unusual in a movie of this type. Even the female characters have personality traits beyond glossy hair and impossibly perfect bodies (of course this being a Hollywood romantic comedy theyre contractually required to have those too). Kunis Rachel is a college dropout with a chip on her shoulder and a tomboyish sense of humor. Sarahs alpha girl mask slips just often enough to show us what Peter liked about her in the first place. And thanks largely to the on-set improvisation of British comic Russell Brand the initially cliched Aldous Snow becomes one of the movies chief delights. Hes a tribally tattooed free-love advocate who blathers about sobriety but hes also a regular bloke whos not above extending his rival a genuine compliment or demonstrating his renowned sex moves on an outsize chess set. Forgetting Sarah Marshall continues the post-Wedding Crashers trend of pushing comedies to the limits of the R rating with lots of explicit dialogue and a few exposed boobs to go with that dangling member. But it avoids the gross-out one-upmanship of filth for filths sake. The nude breakup scene that begins the movie is funny but also painfully intimate like the moment in Robert Altmans Short Cuts when Julianne Moore confesses to a long-ago adulterous affair while naked from the waist down. A late scene in which Sarah and Peter have a miserably failed go at relapse sex is a good example of raunchiness that serves a narrative purpose. Other scenes like the extended ""pearl necklace"" gag thats been so heavily peddled in trailers are just dirty for the laugh-getting hell of it and thats OK too. Ultimately this movie sets itself apart from other recent Apatow releases because of the strong script and central performance from Jason Segel whose budding career rests on the twin foundations of earnestness and self-humiliation. As Nick on the cult TV series Freaks and Geeks he memorably and unsuccessfully courted Linda Cardellini with an a cappella serenade of Styxs ""Lady"" and just this week his character on the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother broke down in tears in front of his boss. Even Segels physique is refreshing. Neither a washboard-stomached hunk nor a joshing fat guy hes the first leading man in recent memory whos actually built like most men I know. Like its hero Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a little soft around the middle but all the more loveable for that. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Jason Segel who also wrote the screenplay plays Peter a TV music composer utterly infatuated with his glamorous actress girlfriend (Kristen Bell). Hes resigned to living in her shadow writing suspense music for her cop show and toting her handbag at photo shoots because hes convinced of her love. When she dumps him for a self-absorbed English rock star the big softie dissolves into a quivering puddle of Jell-O. Peters half-brother advises him to take a healing vacation to Hawaii but its out of the frying pan into the volcano Sarah and her new guy are checked into the same hotel. Theres a lot of material here you might remember from ""The Breakup"" and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" yet ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" twists familiar elements into amusing new shapes braiding comically distraught heartache with sensitive romance and inside-showbiz comedy. Segel makes an agreeably troubled Everyman unable to prevent himself from spying on Sarah but pleasantly distracted by warm pretty desk clerk Rachel (Mila Kunis). Segels hound-dog face can express a dozen shades of heart-wrenching disappointment then beam with unrestrained delight. Hes even convincing in handling scenes of complex mixed emotions as when he has to admit that Sarahs egocentric beau (played to preening perfection by English comic Russell Brand) is the coolest dude hes ever met. Thats the kind of weird perceptive scene that Apatow-produced comedies pride themselves on an idea most date movies would never address. Technically the film is run-of-the-mill. Director Nick Stoller has no great appreciation for Hawaiis natural beauty. Most of the island scenes could have been rendered as effectively with the actors standing in front of a bluescreen. The editing has no special punch and for a film about rival musicians theres not much of a score. The appeal of these films is reconnecting with the Apatow stock company watching them play badminton with punch lines and try on new disguises. Paul Rudd pops up as a stoned surfing instructor who seems about to tip over on dry land Jonah Hill is a resort waiter with a desperate artistic crush on Brand and Bill Hader circles the fringes of the story as Peters half-brother eager to steer him through the pitfalls of a breakup even though hes only had one relationship. Kunis a newcomer to the stable is a standout as the sympathetic clerk who gives Peter more to think about than his woes. The true star of the show however is Brand as the narcissistic rocker a preposterously funny monster of ego. Heres hoping Apatow signs them both to a long-term contract. FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL  out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content language and some graphic nudity. The film takes the sensible attitude that the end of one thing can offer the beginning of another. Peter leaves the TV grind to pursue his passion project a puppet musical about Dracula. That endeavor complete with puppets from Jim Hensons workshop occupies more space than it needs to in the final minutes. Its staged in a broad exuberant fashion but seems out of place like an extended trailer for the next Segel/Stoller collaboration the upcoming Muppet movie. Deflecting attention from the newborn romance between Peter and Rachel it ends the movie on a note of forced whimsy rather than emotional closure. Maybe next time out theyll get the ending right.

(By Glen Wilson -- Universal) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 18 2008 As we find ourselves watching yet another male-centric romantic comedy from Judd Apatow -- he of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" -- we ask ourselves What more is there to dredge from the well of mans arrested development? This StoryMovies Forgetting Sarah Marshall Guy Loses Girl WinninglyMovieMakers Kristen Bell Sassy Is the New CuteForgetting Sarah MarshallFind Sarah Marshall ShowtimesView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Plenty. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" which Apatow produced and which clearly bears his hapless dude-specific sense of humor is here to tell us that mankinds cluelessness in matters of life and love is a bottomless reservoir. And we can take a sort of contemplative delight -- on a Jungian level -- in the many ways that maturity-challenged behavior can amuse us. (The alternative is to cry of course but who wants soggy popcorn?) Lead performer Jason Segel is Peter a curly-haired bear cub who puts a lovable face on that subject as he stumbles through a relationship breakup amid frontal nudity gags and jokes about STDs. While ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Knocked Up"" remain bigger movies for the social topics (sex issues and unplanned pregnancy) they conjure the new movie is every bit as enjoyable. As with most of the male characters in Apatows movies -- from Steve Carells sexually squeamish Andy Stitzer in ""Virgin"" to the sexually obsessed teens in ""Superbad"" -- vulnerability is Peters comedic saving grace. Which explains why were already guffawing at the opening image of Peter standing naked in front of the mirror flexing his pecs. He does it because he can. Hes a proud little child in his early 20s. ""Good for you dude"" he says to himself as his chest muscles flicker in a sort of performing seal alternation. ""Good for you."" Yes he lacks a certain adult microchip. But hes hard-wired to a thudding bass drum of a heart. And that endearing quality becomes the comedys redemptive thread as he retreats to Hawaii trying to forget about Sarah (Kristen Bell) the girlfriend who left him for an English rock star named Aldous (Russell Brand). No sooner has Peter checked into the hotel than he discovers Sarahs booked there too -- with Aldous. Awkward. The coincidence isnt actually as absurd as it sounds; Hawaii was Sarah and Peters dream destination. But the story line carries that odor of rom-com predictability -- yes Peter meets another woman (Mila Kunis) who might just be The One. Still its semi-improvisational atmosphere is the real pleasure. Between those groaningly familiar plotlines first-time director Nicholas Stoller and Segel who also scripted open up a lot of space for wild-card serendipity giving us the delicious sense that anything could happen. Of course anything does. Like the scene in which Sarah drops in to tell Peter the romance is over. Stunned Peter drops his towel -- the only thing hes wearing. And as he weeps bows his head and bends over in anguish the audience hoots with eye-shielding horror laughing at the disconnect between Peters emotional pain and his comedic lack of dignity. Peters agony and suffering as he keeps bumping into the happy beautiful new couple is the main motif. But the joy of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is how that theme ripples out into so many hilarious subplots featuring a Whos Who of Apatow movie veterans Paul Rudd as a surfing instructor who calls people by their ""Hawaiian names"" Jonah Hill as a hotel waiter with a stalkerish crush on Aldous and Bill Hader as Peters overly wound-up best buddy. The showstopper however is Brand a British stand-up comedian whose self-absorbed post-Byronic rocker could easily have stumbled off the set of ""This Is Spinal Tap."" As Aldous his inability to filter details of his womanizing or sexual prowess tortures Peter with every utterance or diffident sweep of the head. Apatows specialty has always been malius dumbius the male of the species a gender focus that has drawn criticism for its portrayal of women as humor-impaired nags and drags. But though once again the female characters in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" only amount to walking-talking prizes to be loved chased or fought over Bell and Kunis bring feisty funny dimension to their roles. And there is one tense-dialogue scene between the two -- when the subtext is territorial possession of Peter -- thats one of the movies most sensitively written moments. These characters are obviously exaggerations but at least those exaggerations spring directly from reality as opposed to from Hollywoods rom-com stockroom of jocks dweebs and haughty-hotties. The films improvisational loosey-gooseyness as with all Apatow movies amounts to a cathartic bonus an acknowledgment that real life is also full of stupid embarrassing and klutzy moments. And hopefully we can laugh at those too with philosophical satisfaction. Forgetting Sarah Marshall (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for nudity profanity slapstick violence and sexual content. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Forgetting Sarah Marshall Guy Loses Girl Winningly Kristen Bell Sassy Is the New Cute Find Sarah Marshall Showtimes Forgetting Sarah Marshall",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/17/AR2008041704325.html,200,forgettingsarahmarshall21,forgettingsarahmarshall,washingtonpost

As anyone presold on the aptly classified ""romantic disaster comedy"" probably already knows the writer and star appears quite emphatically naked from all angles very early in the game As struggling L.A. musician Peter Bretter hes first seen toweling off at home anticipating the arrival of his girlfriend of the title (Kristen Bell) a TV star in the magnificently named CSI-like hit series Crime Scene Scene of the Crime. Peter is feeling frisky but Sarah very much the perky media professional is feeling fed up with the guy after nearly six years of using him as a handbag-holding service at red-carpet events and has a breakup on her agenda. Its a credit both to the vulnerability of the dumpee (and his refusal to make the business any easier for the dumper) as well as to Segels love of the hilarity of discomfort that Peter remains altogether in the altogether throughout the kiss-off. Shocked and pleading for a hug from his departing blond cutie his exposed man flesh looks all the more alien and ungainly when pressed up against his about-to-be-exs clothed compact form. Nakedness has rarely looked so...naked. And innately universally comic. As embodiments go the Segel physique a long pale uncooked dinner roll of a shape is an apt one for the attractions of this very funny very chewy partially undercooked comedy. Indeed with even more ferocity of purpose and Andy Kaufman-school fearlessness than that roly-poly Seth Rogen in Knocked Up or noodly-oodly Christopher Mintz-Plasse in Superbad Segel embraces the destiny of male anatomy in yet another clever creation from the Judd Apatow Alumni Association; this one too speaks from the male heart (and other parts) in a language accessible to females. Yet it does so with a fresh yeastiness I havent already seen in other Apatovian products. The droopy physical doughiness of the hero (and his fearless creator) with his hangdog posture and flatfooted walk is key to his unlikely attractiveness. Hes not a nerd not a commitmentphobe not an adult virgin in need of special handling or a stripling looking for experience. Hes just a less-than-ab-toned man of pleasant musical talents (his dream project is a musical about Count Dracula with puppets) and recognizable neuroses at least temporarily on the wrong end of the relationship equation. And hes got the breakup blues bad. Peter sobs drinks has meaningless sex (after which he sobs some more) screws up at work and falls apart. And thus ""girlified"" with all the expressed neediness more traditionally ascribed to the touchier-feelier sex he takes the advice of his intermittently apoplectic married step-brother (indispensable SNL player Bill Hader) to take a healing vacation in Hawaii where flesh goes for braising. What are the odds that Sarah would be there too at the same resort accompanied by her new dude a beaded bangled and tattooed British rocker with the perfect Blighty name of Aldous Snow (Russell Brand)? One hundred percent. A dark-haired new woman helps Peter forget Sarah Marshall; shes a cat-eyed beauty named Rachel (Mila Kunis) who works at the hotel and is as magically unpretentious easygoing and attracted to the hurtin Peter as Sarah is brittle and duplicitous. (In fact Bell from Veronica Mars and Heroes is excellent playing the tricky role of Hardass Girl to Kunis more sympathetic Softshoulder Girl.) But Forgetting Sarah Marshall really does forget Sarah Marshall or at least puts her in perspective -- her and all the Sarahs who mess with the heads of their Peters. For better and sometimes for worse first-time director Nicholas Stoller (yet another graduate of the Undeclared Academy -- will any feature-comedy maker today who isnt please step forward?) lets the action shamble along as Segel and his co-conspirators riff on varieties of male bewilderment. 30 Rocks Jack McBrayer plays up his rube-at-the-luau skills as a virginal newlywed who cant figure out which end of his lusty new wife (Maria Thayer) is up; Paul Rudd is priceless (yep as ever) as a stoner surfer; Jonah Hill has a small excellently cringe-inducing role as a suck-up to Aldous rock godliness. Jawing about pop culture with typical School of Judd razor wit these men might be giants. The rest of the time theyre merely hilariously mortal.

Just so you know ""appropriate sense of humor"" in this case means that you laugh at raunchy jokes wacky sex scenes and the sight of a grown man completely naked - completely naked - as his girlfriend breaks up with him. And if you dont? See it anyway. Afterwards you will. Its the Superbad of chick flicks and thats high praise indeed. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is the latest film from the Judd Apatow team and its a fantastic return to form after such near-misses as Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story and such whiffs as Drillbit Taylor. It stars Jason Segel who also wrote the script and like the best Apatow-produced projects Segel layers on the raunch over a strong foundation of real feeling - in this case heartbreak. That comes by way of Sarah (Kristen Bell) the star of a CSI-like TV show who dumps her beau Peter (Segel) in the aforementioned naked scene. Which in addition to being uncomfortably funny also serves as one of the more offbeat framing devices youll ever see in a movie (to say more would spoil it). To get over Sarah dumping him Peter - who writes music for her show - first tries meaningless sex and booze both in heavy doses. That doesnt do the trick so at the behest of his pal Brian (Bill Hader) Peter heads for a resort in Hawaii. Where he finds Sarah with her new boyfriend self-absorbed rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) staying at the same resort. From there its mostly Peter trying to get over Sarah in an almost impossible setting for it. He meets Rachel (Mila Kunis) who works at the hotel and lends him a shoulder to cry on (and Peter does a lot of crying). He meets a guest (30 Rocks delightful Jack McBrayer) on his honeymoon whos not quite up to the task. He takes surfing lessons from a stoned-out dude (Paul Rudd funnier than he has been in ages). And he tries out some songs from his passion project a Dracula musical. With puppets. But mostly he tries to forget Sarah Marshall. Will he? The best thing about the film - aside from the belly laughs - is that it twists your expectations of what happens in these movies. For instance Sarah is a tricky role. Typically you want to hate the woman who dumps the guy because shes a selfish shrew. Yet Bell manages to make Sarah likable. Were not on her side exactly but we dont want to push her off a cliff or anything. Shes the most complex female character weve seen in an Apatow film and Bell is the perfect choice to play her. Similarly Brands me-first rock star (based largely on Liam Gallagher of Oasis were guessing) is as Peter puts it actually kind of a good guy. On the rare occasions he takes his eyes off himself he certainly sees whats going on with everyone else before they do. Kunis is worlds better than she was playing Jackie in TVs That 70s Show. And Segels Peter is a big lug a good-natured guy whose shoulder you want to throw your arm around and say ""Buck up pal thingsll get better."" Like Superbad Forgetting Sarah Marshall shies away from nothing in its attempts to make you laugh. Yet it also has enough heart to make you feel invested in the characters to make you care what happens to them in a way that most movies of this ilk do not. In other words Youll laugh Youll cry Well you wont cry really (unless you laugh so hard you cry). Whatever the case Peter might want to forget Sarah Marshall. But you wont.

"Forgetting Sarah Marshall | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; forgetting-sarah-marshall ) Forgetting Sarah Marshall (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli With The 40-Year-Old Virgin Judd Apatow succeeded in an endeavor that foiled many of the more accomplished directors to precede him the merging of the romantic comedy a quintessential ""female genre"" with the raunchy comedy a quintessential ""male genre."" The result had broad appeal especially among college-age adults. Apatow used the same basic formula to similar effect for his follow-up Knocked Up. Now at least temporarily he has passed the baton to one of his buddies former Freaks and Geeks cohort Jason Segel. Forgetting Sarah Marshall written by and starring Segel and directed by first-timer Nicholas Stoller is at least as good as the two Apatow-directed movies with a script that might be both a little sharper and a little more romantic. Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) has lost his love of life. A composer for a popular TV program his preferred activity is lying on the couch while watching mind-numbing shows like Access Hollywood. But as bad as things are going for Peter he hasnt yet hit bottom. That moment arrives when his girlfriend of five years actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell) announces that shes leaving him. While Sarah might have viewed their relationship as having run its course Peter isnt of the same mind. He goes to pieces. After trying and failing to get over Sarah in Los Angeles Peter decides that he needs a change of scenery so he heads for Hawaii. As (bad) luck would have it Sarah is there at the same hotel with her new boyfriend rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). The only ray of hope for Peter is the attractive hotel receptionist Rachel (Mila Kunis) who sympathizes with Peters situation and offers a supportive hand. The characters in Forgetting Sarah Marshall are better developed than one expects in a movie of this sort. Segel plays Peter as a bit of a schlub but not so much of a loser that the audience cant relate to him. Kristen Bell stepping away from the small screen avoids the easy out of portraying Sarah as a bitch. She brings a touch of humanity to the role ensuring that while viewers may not respect the character they dont dislike her. Mila Kunis who has spent the majority of her career on That 70s Show is delightful as the bubbly Rachel. This is the kind of part that can lead to bigger and better opportunities because shes not just easy on the eyes shes adept with her performance and understands the concept of comic timing. It doesnt take long for Rachel to become Forgetting Sarah Marshalls most vivid character. Several Apatow regulars have small roles. Bill Hader is Peters less-than-supportive brother Jonah Hill is a creepy waiter and Paul Rudd is a surfing teacher named Chuck whose brain has been fried by weed. When it comes to leading by example Segel doesnt shy away from controversy. Most of the films nudity comes from him as he does the Full Monty on several occasions. As is usually the case with male nudity its all done in the name of shock value and comedy. (In a sexual context similar nudity would earn an NC-17.) Theres some peek-a-boo nakedness from Kristen Bell and Mila Kunis but neither really shows much and those scenes are tame compared with Segels forceful assertion that at least in R-rated movies the penis is a sadly neglected organ. (At the time when Walk Hard was released Apatow stated that from now on all of the movies with which he was involved as a writer director or producer would feature at least one penis. Hes two for two.) The balance between raunchiness and romance in Forgetting Sarah Marshall is carefully calibrated so that the movie never leans too far in either direction. There are times when it seems like a cousin to When Harry Met Sally and other occasions when its more closely related to Animal House. While the comedy may be universally sophomoric its often smarter than it initially seems and the lowbrow gags while they are present dont dominate. Yes there are a lot of sex jokes but theyre just that - sex jokes. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is almost entirely devoid of gross-out moments and it never descends into the gutter where so many other so-called ""comedies"" get their loudest laughs yet the movie isnt any less funny because of it. Im not going to argue that Forgetting Sarah Marshall is in ""good taste"" or that its humor is sophisticated but it shows that comedy can be hilarious and dirty without becoming disgusting. Theres a wit in Segels writing that marks him as every bit Apatows equal in this arena. His dialogue crackles and he has an instinct when it comes to taking expected romantic comedy scenarios and tweaking them ever-so-slightly so they dont play out exactly as expected. Sure the movie ends the way its supposed to but the path to get there isnt as straightforward as one might suppose. Would the scenario work if so much of the humor didnt hit home? Fortunately thats not a question that needs to be answered. And Forgetting Sarah Marshall is surprisingly sweet. The biggest thing Segel shows during the course of this movie isnt his dick its his heart.

By David Denby Hawaiian romance Mila Kunis Jason Segel Russell Brand and Kristen Bell.   Credit HOPE GANGLOFF Why is it so hard to make a good comedy set on a tropical island? This is a question that has vexed the sleep of the greatest film theorists and scholars. Think of the lame ""Joe Versus the Volcano"" (1990) with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan; or of the shirtless Owen Wilson caper ""The Big Bounce"" (2004); or of Anne Heche and Harrison Ford eying each other warily then snarling and scrapping in ""Six Days Seven Nights"" (1998). Beauty is the killer here especially in the Hawaii films. In the background purplish clouds gather over dark-green hillsides and enormous rocks greet the sparkling ocean and send frothy tumult into the air. . . . Hawaii is so improbably gorgeous that the very thought of it produces vacation-brochure prose. Imagine then what cinematographers and directors are up against. The swollen and sensual landscape is an inducement to lolling and lovemaking. In Hawaiian hotel society dress is meagre and frequently orange the drinks wear hats and the staff collars the guests with wet flowers. Such soft damp pleasures offer little social structure for comedy to batter against. In the new ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" set in some lush corner of Oahus north shore the characters are all jumping into bed or trying to and after a while the movie becomes fitful and halfhearted. Comedy requires clothes. ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was produced by Judd Apatow; it was written by its star Jason Segel an Apatow actor going back to the TV series ""Freaks amp; Geeks"" in 1999 and directed by Nicholas Stoller an Apatow writing partner. Other members of the gang can be seen hanging around the edges of the story Jonah Hill as an obsequious waiter Paul Rudd as a grinning bonged-out surfing instructor Bill Hader as an upright fellow on the mainland who stays in touch by teleconferencing. All of them are working in second gear. Segel who may not have a third or fourth gear plays Peter Bretter a recognizable Apatovian hero he thinks obsessively about sex and at the same time hes an instinctively moral man. A Los Angeles composer Peter writes music--or at least sounds--for a ridiculous cop series on TV starring his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). When Sarah dumps him hes miserable and lost and after sleeping with everyone in town he takes off for Hawaii only to run into Sarah and her new boyfriend at his hotel. The vacation-spot coincidence is so lame a plot turn that you groan over it but theres a benefit here--the boyfriend one Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) a Brit rocker and professional sex god turns out to be the best thing in the movie. Russell Brand who has had several TV shows of his own in England is tall and rangy with dark locks that hang straight down in hipster-Biblical style. His Aldous Snow exudes love he randomly hugs sheikhs and nuns and onstage he disports himself in a way that would make Marilyn Manson blush. The movie is about Peters attempt to get over his girlfriend while this peacock is fanning his tail and making out with Sarah all over the hotel. Jason Segel is a big guy handsome in a slightly sappy way. Hes naked at the beginning of the movie when Sarah arrives home to dump him and naked at the very end of it. Peter is incapable of concealing anything; he has no vanity but hes a bit of a lazy boy potatoing on the couch in Los Angeles when hes not working. Segel is extremely gentle and his puzzlement has comic possibilities but hes not quite an actor yet. He loses focus; his jaw goes slack and his eyes register bewilderment. In Hawaii Peter is humiliated a lot he falls off a cliff he cant stand up on a surfboard and so on. All this ineptitude is supposed to be endearing but moviegoers want a romantic hero with some sex appeal and some strength and Segels harmless routine wears us out. Part of the problem is that his director Nicholas Stoller doesnt shape the scenes decisively. He abandons Segel and doesnt get a clearly defined performance out of Kristen Bell (from TVs ""Veronica Mars"" and ""Heroes""). Shes short and blond with a very bright smile and she comes off as hard-edged and self-centered in some scenes and truthful in others and we never get a bead on her. Its not hard it turns out to forget Sarah Marshall. The problem is remembering her. In outline the story is a twist on the slacker-striver romances that have been so prevalent in recent years and that reached their culmination last summer in Apatows ""Knocked Up."" This time the question is not whether the slacker hero can be worthy of the love of a hard-driving woman. The question is Can he gather enough self-respect to get over his girlfriend and move on with his life? Peter has his ambitions as a composer and in Hawaii he discovers his muse--Rachel (Mila Kunis) who works as a desk clerk at the hotel. In a state (as the movie tells it) that is heavily populated by screw-ups from the mainland Rachel has put her blunders behind her and the darkly beautiful Kunis who was born in Ukraine seems the only grown-up person around. Amid the nattering events of this shapeless workshop movie Kuniss presence comes as a relief. At least she knows who she is. In recent years some of the directors working on modest budgets (in and out of Hollywood) have developed a chaste and rather refined new style--a style devoted to minute perceptions of character that lead to small revelations of how life works. Lets call it the cinema of observation. Im thinking of filmmakers like Noah Baumbach (""The Squid and the Whale"") Nicole Holofcener (""Friends with Money"") Tamara Jenkins (""The Savages"") Andrew Wagner (""Starting Out in the Evening"") and now Noam Murro whose new ""Smart People"" is about a middle-aged literature professor in a funk. There are many differences in method and emphasis among these filmmakers yet by normal Hollywood standards all the movies mentioned above are underdramatized. The directors concentrate on three or four characters and on common domestic situations (a professors dowdy book-shadowed apartment is a familiar setting); they keep the camera still and create very little life--or none at all--in the foreground or the background. These movies lack the kinetic swirl and sensuous enticements that are among the basic pleasures of moviegoing. (They may not have much music either.) Instead they offer small sharp intensities and especially unspoken or half-spoken feelings--frustration grief repressed ambition. The movies are devoted to the disappointments of middle-class ""success""--the characters drive bashed old Saabs and Volvos. ""Smart People"" which was written by the novelist and short-story writer Mark Poirier is about a widower who has removed himself from life. Bored by the courses he teaches at Carnegie Mellon Lawrence Wetherhold (Dennis Quaid) blames his students for his own lethargy and at home hes sour and remote with his children--an undergraduate son at the college (Ashton Holmes) and a brilliant high-school-age daughter Vanessa (Ellen Page) who shares her fathers scholarly asceticism. Vanessa has a sharp tongue however and the devastatingly sure-footed Page (from ""Juno"") drops zingers into the dead air of the family dinners. Both children remain angrily in love with an ideal version of their father--a version that is rapidly fading from view. The family is completed by Lawrences adopted brother (Thomas Haden Church) a sweet-natured but stunningly unemployable sponger who plops his body down in the house and stays. Quaid developed a gut for the role and he hides his still boyish cheeks under a ragged beard that emphasizes his big nose. His Lawrence looks willfully terrible as if he felt he didnt deserve to look any better. ""Smart People"" is a return-to-life movie but its determined to limit Lawrences reawakening to small steps he carries on an awkward affair with a former student of his who has become a doctor (Sarah Jessica Parker) but the affair keeps falling apart. Most of the time the characters sit around or drive somewhere matching wits or making critical remarks about one another. In his first film as director Noam Murro creates moments of comic disconnection relieved by minuscule surges of warmth. Hes very precise; he has a nice touch. Yet I had an odd sensation (Ive had it at other movies like this) that Murro was eager to remain calmly and quietly at the level of observation as long as he could that he wanted to avoid conventional movieness--powerful emotions and the vulgarity of a dramatic climax. But a movie cant end as a good short story might with a mere pinprick of insight. In ""The Savages"" Tamara Jenkins licked the problem by pitching the work of her stars (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney) at a steady level of tension; their hostile and loving jabs at each other kept the picture alive all the way through. But Murros cooler and drier approach leaves him no easy way to accelerate and he lurches toward a conclusion. These small-scale intelligent movies can fall into a trap its hard to achieve a satisfactory dramatic climax when observation is your principal dramatic mode.

Plus The problem with Judd Apatow. _ By David Edelstein Published Apr 21 2008 ShareThis Errol Morris on the set of Standard Operating Procedure.  (Photo Nubar Alexanian/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) Lynndie England speaks in Errol Morriss latest documentary Standard Operating Procedure. Shes filmed like many of her fellow ex-soldiers in close-up against a neutral background her face filled out her hair dark and abundant. You wouldnt recognize her as the freakish Abu Ghraib poster girlthe close-cropped homuncular figure holding a leash with a naked Iraqi on all fours. Demonized convicted dishonorably discharged and paroled England appears in Morriss fastidious context depressingly human not at all a Rumsfeld-ian bad apple. Believe her or not excuse her or not her presence reminds you that what happened the night of those notorious 2003 photos was more than met the lens. In Standard Operating Procedure Morris has hold of a monster subject one in which politics and art bleed together. Using his own standard operating procedurefixed camera slow-motion reenactments a hypnotic scorethe director circles in on two points that the men and women demoted or convicted for abusing prisoners at Abu Ghraib were doing as theyd been ordered by higher-ups who remain unpunished; and that the photos obscure larger and more complicated truths. Im not sure Morris clinches his case but Im not sure he wants to His aim is to throw a monkey wrench into the cogs of our perception. BACKSTORY Famed as a documentarian Errol Morris has a lucrative side gig directing commercials for companies ranging from Nike to Southern Comfort. But he doesnt shy away from mixing morals with money One beer ad for Miller shows a fleshy middle-aged man bicycling through the snow while a voice-over intones his thoughts about the importance of alternative fuels Let the OPECs keep their gasoline If we all learn to pull our weight nobody nobody will be able to siphon away our high life. The requisite product placement is reduced to two six-packs clinking in his basket. Morriss other movies have raised issues a la Susan Sontag about the morality of the photographic image although not always on purpose. In films like Dr. Death and The Thin Blue Line he has a tendency to make his subjects look like specimens in a jar. Ive even written that maintaining a fixed distance from people busy hanging themselves with their own words can be in some cases a form of cowardice. But Standard Operating Procedure comes from a less ironic vantage. As he weaves together their accounts Morris palpably sympathizes with his subjects Hes using his own camera to liberate them from the restrictive frame of someone elses. England was prodded to take that leash by a man she loved and whose baby she would ultimately haveCharles Graner the Busby Berkeley of that particular danse macabre. She wasnt yanking that Iraqi The leash is slack. She had been told that she could do anything short of killing em and most of her fellow guards were doing all kinds of things. The voice of Morris intrudesa rare occurrence. Did any of this sound weird? Not when we were told it could save lives. Its possible that Morris errs on the side of compassion. What are we to make of the guard Sabrina Harmans broad smile astride a human pyramid? When you get into a photo says Harman you want to smile. Yesand no. But then she reads from a letter she sent to her partner Kelly in which her doubt and shame are right there on the surface. The world of Abu Ghraib these ex-soldiers depict is morally upendingthe stuff of grisly farce. An Iraqi found dead after extreme interrogation is zipped into a body bag iced down then hauled the next day into the showers so hed lookdespite his lividity and horrific bruisesas if hed keeled over from a heart attack. Clearly the people giving orders were the ones who needed to be on leashes. Morris had amazing accessnot to Graner whos in Army custody but to former Brigadier General Janis Karpinski no fan of Donald Rumsfeld and the lackeys who directed guards to treat the prisoners like dogs and relieved her of command when the world saw them doing just that. Morris provides a bit of political context but Id recommend seeing Alex Gibneys Taxi to the Dark Side for a more overarching assessment of the Rumsfeld-Cheney policy to combine a fog of ambiguity with relentless pressure for results. See Standard Operating Procedure for its riveting narrative for the way it keeps looping backto the swirls of Danny Elfmans night musicto the basement of Abu Ghraib. Special Agent Brent Pack who analyzed the photos and sent many of Morriss subjects to military prison says A picture is worth a thousand words. Okay maybe. But which words? Whose words? I have a fantasy of the Judd Apatow Factory which has produced Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin and now Forgetting Sarah Marshall. I envision a clubhouse for suddenly wealthy dweeb filmmakers who climb out of their Beemers shamble into their new digs and earnestly discuss the problem of leaving adolescence to settle down with beautiful women they could never approach in high school but have now managed to land. Then they shamble into casting sessions in which beautiful actresses try out opposite dweebish actors for comedies about dweebish men with problems leaving adolescence and settling down with beautiful women. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Its director first-timer Nicholas Stoller and its writer and star Jason Segel are alumni of Judd Apatows cult TV shows ""Undeclared"" and ""Freaks and Geeks."" Like ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" which established Apatow as the definitive comic observer of the perpetually adolescent American male--a clueless slothful hairy beast in desperate need of female taming--""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" focuses on a guy in the throes of romantic agony. His name is Peter (Segal) and hes just been dumped by the love of his life the beautiful blonde Sarah (Kristen Bell) the star of a TV cop show called ""Crime Scene Scene of the Crime."" The guys an open wound which makes him a perfect subject for Apatowian romantic comedy where the line between squirming in pain and squealing with delight is always thin.The breakup scene is not one youre likely to forget for Peter is buck naked when Sarah breaks the bad news and remains that way throughout the entire scene. Its a new and startling use of full-frontal male nudity--one that makes his emotional vulnerability hilariously uncomfortably literal. His humiliations however are just beginning. Peters efforts to drown his sorrows in random sex dont work out as planned--he tends to sob uncontrollably--nor does his escape to Oahu where he hopes to distract himself with mai tais and Margaritas. More bad luck who should he bump into at the luxury resort but Sarah? Even worse shes with her new fling--Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) a leather-clad swaggering Brit rock star who wears his raging libido on his sleeveless arms.A lesser movie would turn the lecherous Snow and the unfaithful Sarah into comic monsters and Peter and his potential new romantic interest the lovely hotel receptionist Rachel (Mila Kunis) into paragons but Segels script is subtler and smarter than that. It has a generosity toward all its characters that rescues it from predictability. Brand a celebrated stand-up comic in Britain noted for his improv makes his preening sober-alchoholic stud almost likable theres something admirable about Snows ruthless honesty. And Bells pampered Sarah against all odds turns surprisingly sympathetic when we get to hear her side of the story. Even more alluring is Kuniss Rachel under whose comforting professional manner lurks a passionate party girl with a big heart and a hair-trigger temper. Segel a big fleshy white boy with a face on the borderline between bland and good-looking may initially seem an odd leading-man choice but this cherubic sad sack grows on you. That harmless surface conceals killer comic instincts. As a bonus Stoller stuffs his movie with such Apatow regulars as Paul Rudd (as a stoner surfing instructor) Jonah Hill (as Snows too-rabid admirer) and Bill Hader (as Peters brother coaching him through his crisis) They are becoming a repertory company as reliable as Preston Sturgess great second bananas. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week If ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" doesnt reach the inspired heights of ""Knocked Up"" or ""Superbad"" it runs a very respectable second. And it sticks with you unlike so many disposable romps because you can sense the laughs are built on hard-earned personal experience. Who doesnt know what it feels like to get dumped? Segel and Stoller obviously subscribe to the Apatow credo no pain no comic gain.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Reprising his successful ""Knocked Up"" formula of uninhibited bawdiness and chick-flick sweetness with side orders of slapstick and showbiz satire producer Judd Apatow looks to have scored another long-legged hit with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" Crowd-pleasing confection sees the comedy auteur once again hooking up with fellow vets of cult-fave teleseries ""Freaks and Geeks"" and ""Undeclared"" -- including in this case director Nick Stoller and scripter-star Jason Segel -- who are perfectly in sync with his snarky romantic-comedy sensibilities. Result is a film that like ""Knocked Up"" should generate repeat biz among ticketbuyers and memorable homevid sales and rentals. Peter Bretter (Segel) a beefy teddy bear with a sensitive streak and a slackerish attitude is a genial underachiever who composes incidental music for a TV crime show toplining his beautiful girlfriend Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell). Hes used to living in her shadow -- he holds her purse at premieres and photo shoots -- but hes unshakably certain of her love. So hes devastated when she ends their affair and takes up with Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) a slinky self-absorbed Brit rocker. Peter tries to lift himself out of his funk by flying to Hawaii for an improvised vacation. Unfortunately he checks into the very same resort where Sarah and Aldous are enjoying a lusty holiday. Throughout the ensuing awkwardness of his extended stay Peter gets emotional support -- among other things -- from Rachael (an attention-grabbing Mila Kunis) a hotel desk clerk recovering from her own heartbreak. Peter also interacts with characters amusingly played by members of what might be called the Apatow Repertory Company a genially dazed surfing instructor (Paul Rudd) and a starstruck waiter and would-be musician (Jonah Hill) whos desperately eager for Aldous to hear his audition CD. The rockers lazily dismissive response to the latter will likely be the pics most-quoted line. Theres lots of other funny stuff -- withering put-downs nifty non sequiturs seriocomic ravings wisecracks that range from snappy to snappish -- in Segels casually structured screenplay. Stoller making his feature helming debut keeps the pace mostly brisk but hes also attentive to character development particularly with two figures who in similar comedies might come off as entirely unlikeable. Aldous may be suffused by his sense of entitlement but hes arguably the most honest and self-aware person on screen and Brands performance is marvelously droll and controlled. Bell (late of TVs ""Veronica Mars"") executes an equally deft juggling act so that Sarah often comes across as simultaneously treacherous and vulnerable. William Baldwin and Jason Bateman offer clever cameos as Sarahs co-stars in wink-wink parodies of primetime crime shows. Segel makes an engaging impression throughout ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" gamely making himself the butt of many jokes that involve Peters non-macho proclivities. (To paraphrase the old Four Seasons song Big boys docry.) And in a bold move that bespeaks dedication to art or pride of possession (or both) Segel does the full monty no less than twice in matter-of-fact raunchy scenes that gleefully push at the limits of R-rated acceptability. Russ T. Alsobrooks attractive lensing of Hawaiian locales and Leesa Evans witty costume design add to the pics overall appeal.
