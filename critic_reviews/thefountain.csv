A three-pronged narrative sees Tommy (Hugh Jackman) and Izzi (Rachel Weisz) flit casually between the sixteenth and twenty-sixth centuries as they impotently descend into mental turmoil at the idea of impending mortality. Tommy spends half the film either crying or smashing up his office while Izzi deals with her terminal illness by coughing up dreary factoids on Mayan death rituals her pout constantly bathed in soft-focus close-up. What dialogue there is seems to have been snagged from fortune cookies (Death is the road to awe) with Clint Mansells slushy one-note score accentuating the hubris further. Though many will succumb to its hallucinatory visuals and glib philosophising its basically Woody Allens Love and Deathwith the jokes taken out and thats not very funny at all.

"Darren Aronofskys The Fountain reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Darren Aronofskys The Fountain reviewed. Darren Aronofskys The Fountain reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 29 2006 1020 PM Infinity and Beyond Darren Aronofsky goes to the stars. By Dana Stevens Darren Aronofsky discusses a scene with Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman in The Fountain Darren Aronofskys The Fountain (Warner Bros.) is by any standard a grand folly of a movie. In his first attempt at getting the thing made beginning in 2000 Aronofsky wasted 18 million built a Mayan pyramid that sat moldering in Australia and cast and then lost Brad Pitt as the films time-traveling hero. Countless script rewrites and budget cuts later the 95-minute result starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz provoked both a standing ovation and a shoving match between two journalists at the Venice Film Festival. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Aronofsky cultists have rallied around the movie--one IMDB user review called it ""the best movie of the 21st century."" And some critics agree. On Rotten Tomatoes a Web site that compiles film reviews The Fountain as of this morning had a rating of precisely 50 percent. The Houston Chronicles critic called it a ""sublime metaphysical head trip"" and a ""transcendent work of art"" while the Hollywood Reporter labeled it a ""flatulent dissertation"" that raised no question deeper than ""Zardoz anyone?"" Advertisement With its transhistorical narrative gold-burnished palette and mind-blowing special effects The Fountain couldnt seem more different from Aronofskys first film Pi (1998) a 60000 sleeper shot in high-contrast black-and-white on the streets of Brooklyn. But The Fountainstragic flaw--and to this untranscendent critics eye the movie is pretty tragically flawed--is already present in Pi as well as in the second of Aronofskys three movies Requiem for a Dream (2000). All three movies tell the story of a romantic who pursues with self-destructive ferocity some form of the absolute Sean Gullettes paranoid mathematician in Pi Ellen Burstyns speed-addled housewife in Requiem and Hugh Jackmans space-and-time-bending warrior/doctor/monk in The Fountain. The difference is--and here I guess I should say ""spoiler alert"" though its hard to spoil an ending thats completely incomprehensible to begin with--Jackman finds the damn thing--the absolute that is. And finding it ruins everything that was fun about Aronofsky. The metaphysical complacence of the movies ending is not only the culmination of the directors hubris its an allegory for that hubris. The Fountain is the story of a gifted artist who dared to reach for the stars and paid for his ambition with a really stupid movie. But wait. Like the movie itself Im going about things in a nonlinear fashion here. Let me try my best to recap what actually happens in The Fountainsthree interlocking stories.Just to be crassly chronological about it A 16th-century Spanish conquistador (Hugh Jackman) faces off with a fierce Mayan warrior with sharpened teeth all for the sake of his beloved Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz). Theres a whole iconography about gold rings and royal diadems and other round gold things that links us visually and thematically to the present-day story. There Tommy Creo (again Jackman) is a scientist researching a life-extending treatment for brain tumors while his wife Izzi (Weisz) is dying conveniently enough of a brain tumor. Tommy just cant accept that Izzi will ever have to die even though she has reached a beatific peace with her own end. He sends for a piece of bark from a fabled South American tree one that legends have claimed is the Tree of Life from the Book of Genesis ... but wait Whos this bald monk floating through outer space in a bubble? Its Tom a future incarnation of Tommy Creo--or maybe just a centuries-older version of the same man--who has set out in his trusty bubblecraft for the nebula the Mayans called Xibalba. All because according to Izzis book--did I mention the dying woman wrote a manuscript in calligraphy about the ancient Mayan belief in the afterlife?--merging with Xibalba is the key to achieving immortality. Advertisement Toms companion in the nebula-bound bubble is a strange twisted tree covered in fine hairs and possessed of a magic bark that seems to be both the Tree of Life and also in some strange way Izzi herself. Either way Tom-the-bald-monk-of-the-future is hell-bent on getting this tree to Xibalba posthaste ... or maybe keeping it away from Xibalba at all costs. It doesnt matter; the important thing is if the tree dies so does Izzi completely and finally. Unlike most of the critics who disliked The Fountain Id like to try to take this storyline seriously for a moment. Not because the plot isnt ridiculous but because I want to understand what the movie wants to say about death and loss. In essence beneath all the claptrap about diadems and nebulas and rejuvenated monkey brains this is a Faust story in which a learned mans ambition and curiosity take him beyond the realm of things man is supposed to know. Tommy Creo the present-day husband and scientist should never have climbed into that bubble in a centuries-long attempt to defer his wifes death. (This is no news flash for the audience who have been thinking since 20 minutes in ""Geez Tom. Meet a nice girl already. Go to Match.com."") I wont give away the conclusion of the Xibalba-or-bust plotline both because I dont want to spoil it and because I have no idea what actually takes place. But suffice it to say that if this Faust hasnt succeeded in usurping the knowledge of God himself I dont know who has (with the possible exception of Keir Dullea in 2001 A Space Odyssey; and look what happened to him). In Pi the math-genius hero retells a story several times about how as a curious and rebellious 6-year-old he disobeyed his mothers orders and looked directly at the sun ""At first the brightness was overwhelming but I kept looking forcing myself not to blink and soon the brightness began to dissolve. My pupils shrank to pinholes and everything came into focus and for a moment I understood."" This same scene is acted out on a cosmic scale in the dude-my-mind-is-blown climax of The Fountain. In fact both Pi and The Fountain share in essence the same climax Bald Guy Experiences the Ultimate. That one epiphany happens in a Brooklyn hovel and the other in a bubble floating through infinite space is merely a matter of scale. But the difference between the two movies--and what makes The Fountain a ponderous myth where Pi was a clever fable--is in what happens after that final frontier is breached. The end of Pi has the hero sitting in a city park watching the wind in a tree having humbly desisted in his quest to unify all meaning into one vast mathematical theory. With The Fountain Aronofsky has become the hero of Pi without the desistance or the humility. He not only wants to ask the big questions he tries to tie it all up with The Big Answer. And thats worse than bad metaphysics its bad filmmaking. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Theyre working with a new surveillance technology dubbed Snow White that can peer into the past and call up living images from four days ago. Well thats pretty dazzling as snoopery systems go NSA eat your heart out. And ""Deja Vu"" is pretty dazzling as action adventures go even when its wildly almost defiantly implausible. Movies can make us semi-believe the damnedest things. This movie directed by Tony Scott at his usual headlong pace starts with a ghastly bang -- the terrorist bombing of a New Orleans ferry -- then seems to follow its natural path into a police procedural (or rather an ATF procedural since thats who employs Denzel Washingtons character a sharp-eyed smoothie of an agent named Doug Carlin.) Little by little however we along with Doug realize that weve been dragooned into a time-travel plot where huge energy is brought to bear on towering illogic. All time-travel plots are basically nonsense but Mr. Scott who first made his mark with flashy commercials sells this one by having his genius techies talk ever more loudly and quickly while psychedelic images flash across multiple screens. ""They found a way to fold space onto itself"" someone finally explains. Ah so thats how it works Got it. ENLARGE Lest I sell the movie short techno babble and visual gibberish are only a small part of its appeal. At first theres a fascinating whiff of necrophilia Doug becomes smitten with the retrieved images of a beautiful young murder victim Claire Kuchever whose death may have been connected to the terrorist plot. (Shes played attractively by Paula Patton.) Thats followed by a much stronger whiff of romance as he goes back in time and meets Claire in the course of trying to save her life and foil the plot. Instead of the Terminator hes the Resuscitator. During that longish tumultuous course the physical action amounts to a high-end videogame with a four-day delay; an icy villain is played with scary intensity by James Caviezel. Mr. Washington for his part is up to his hugely likable tricks -- most notably a willingness or eagerness to play against dark intense scenes with the same buoyant spirit he brought to ""Inside Man."" (The strong cast includes Val Kilmer Adam Goldberg and Bruce Greenwood. The cinematographer was Paul Cameron Chris Seagers designed the production and the editor was Chris Lebenzon.) A similar buoyancy sustains the screenplay which in its deja-viewed outline resembles a quite good Jean-Claude Van Damme thriller from 1994 called ""Timecop."" (The script is credited to Bill Marsilli who is making his feature debut and Terry Rossio whos left his voiceprints on one smart zinger after another.) Silly and self-important though the movie may sometimes be ""Deja Vu"" is memorable for a vision of technology-based omniscience that corresponds to our heady fantasies about electronic intelligence-gathering not to mention our hands-on experience with Google Earth. It gives new meaning to living in the past. The History Boys Two inseparable questions -- among many others -- are posed by ""The History Boys"" a thrillingly smart and immensely enjoyable screen version of Alan Bennetts celebrated play. What is education for and how best should it be conducted especially when in this case its beneficiaries/victims are clever crass scintillatingly verbal joyously shallow fact-stuffed sex-crazed boys who as almost-graduates of a small public school in Englands industrial North hope to win scholarships to Oxford or Cambridge? No clear answers are offered or required. This is not a multiple-choice film though its a multiple-theme excursion into the teeming minds of students and teachers alike. The time is the early 1980s and the drama derives from the scholarship quest. To coach the boys and enhance their chances as well as to bring greater glory to the school the hilariously smarmy headmaster hires a recent Oxford graduate Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) who as one boy notes with surprise is ""only five minutes older than we are."" Irwin is the modern man -- quick glib pragmatic ironic iconoclastic. In those five minutes he has mastered the art of teaching to the test and making it look almost reputable. Irwin represents one side of the plays dialectic -- though he doesnt just represent it he inhabits it with charm and verve. On the other side is the schools literature teacher Hector (the magnificent Richard Griffiths) a pudding-pile of a man and a Chips off the old block -- funny witty silly playful (too playful ultimately for his own good) and passionately dedicated to the proposition that education should impart the beginnings of wisdom and that wisdom resides not in facts fancy words or even love of language but in love of life and a deep investment in living it. Comparisons will inevitably be made to such inspirational-teacher films as ""Dead Poets Society"" and theyll be off the mark. ""The History Boys"" doesnt aim to inspire but to excite to stimulate to provoke. And it does so not only through its two dueling pedagogues but through a female teacher Mrs. Lintott (played by Frances de la Tour with heartbreaking irony and ferocity) and through the eight young history scholars themselves -- every one of them interesting each one a new world a-borning. The film was directed by Nicholas Hytner who first staged Alan Bennetts play at Londons National Theater. The question thats ritually asked about filmed plays is whether theyve been sufficiently opened up into real films but its the wrong question here. The screen like the stage can barely contain this marvelous play of intelligence. The Fountain ENLARGE Hugh Jackman stars in Darren Aronofskys fantasy The Fountain I feel for the marketing person charged with devising a tagline for Darren Aronofskys ""The Fountain"" a fantasy whose turgid pretensions defy the very notion of marketing. Still a tagline has been affixed to the campaign -- ""What if you could live forever?"" -- and it has a certain resonance especially after seeing the film which makes 96 minutes seem like eternity. The title refers to the Fountain of Youth which also manifests itself as the Tree Of Life -- pay attention because questions may be asked about the meaning of it all -- in a love story that spans 1000 years (including leap years). Hugh Jackman plays three incarnations of the same hero in the storys three interlocking time frames Tomas a Spanish conquistador serving his queen (whos played stiffly by Rachel Weisz); Tommy a scientist trying to find a cure for his wife Izzis brain tumor (Ms. Weisz again but more relaxed indeed recumbent) and Tom a 26th-century space traveler who with Izzi and the aforementioned tree navigates the galaxies in a snow globe. The images are often sumptuous though occasionally ludicrous -- the cinematographer was Matthew Libatique -- and Clint Mansells music is steadfastly oppressive.    DVD TIP James Caviezel co-starred -- he was billed as Jim Caviezel -- in another time-warping thriller ""Frequency"" (2000) which was directed by Gregory Hoblit from a script by Toby Emmerich. Thanks to weird sunspots Mr. Caviezels John a lonely cop in the New York of the 1990s is able to talk across three decades to his late father Frank played by Dennis Quaid via a ham-radio rig that once belonged to the old man.

Pictures sci-fi fantasy The Fountain. Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Movies critics cant agree on much but theres one assumption most of them hold deeply without ever discussing it. Its that a film that says life is crap is automatically deeper better richer truer than one that says life can be beautiful. Thats a 180 from the prevailing notion in classic Hollywood where optimism was the cardinal belief at least on-screen. (It was in the front office that the knives came out.) Most movies whatever their genre were romances; they aimed for tears and ended with a kiss. But to serious critics then and to the mass audience now sentiment is suspect. Feeling is mushy girly -- for fools. To be soft-hearted is to be soft-headed. So critics will see a horror film with extreme violence or (less frequently) an erotic film with extreme sex and accept these as genre conventions whether or not theyre grossed out or aroused. But a movie that tries to make them feel is somehow pandering to their basest or noblest emotions and as they see it deserves a spanking from any smart reviewer. These days nothing is as easy to deride as dead-serious romance. Darren Aronofsky must have known the risk he was taking as he prepared the ambitious movie romance called The Fountain. His previous films the no-budget Pi (1998) and the low-budget Requiem for a Dream (2000) both quirky art-house hits had been on the somber side to put it mildly. To put it accurately they were visual monologues that took place inside the deranged minds of their protagonists -- respectively a math whiz obsessed by the number 216 and a heroin addict with a possessive (and understandably perplexed) mom. Instantly anybody could see that Aronofsky was one of the few American filmmakers who saw the cinema past as a jumping-off point not a toy store to plunder. His films were full of promise; and more they delivered on their promises. Aronofsky then went the route of so many phenoms being courted and misused by the big studios. Having spent 60000 to make Pi and 4.5 million on Requiem he suddenly had hundred of millions dangled in front of him to direct a Batman prequel or an adaptation of Theodore Roszaks meta-cinematic novel Flicker. Projects collapsed; time marched on. Throughout Aronofsky pursued his own epic The Fountain about a man who will do anything to save his critically ailing wife. The film was to cost near 100 million and to star Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. The original financiers dropped The Fountain when those two bowed out. (They later reunited to make Babel in which they played virtually the same roles.) Aronofsky slimmed down the budget to 35 million cast Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz in the main roles and made the damn movie. The whole trip with all its frustrating detours took six years. Then the Cannes Film Festival rejected The Fountain for its Competition selection. (Youd have to have seen the films the Festival chose to understand what an insult that was to Aronofsky.) The picture finally received its world premiere in September at the Venice Film Festival. The history of movie romance is the story of beautiful people with terrible problems. Thats The Fountain in a nutshell. Jackman is medical scientist Tom Creo whos conducting experiments to ""stop aging. Stop dying."" He has been injecting Mayan medicine into the tumorous brain of a monkey named Donovan (a tribute to the 1953 surgical science-fiction movie Donovans Brain) to find a cure for the cancer that threatens the life of his novelist wife Izzy played by Weisz. Thats one story. Another is the quest of a 16th-century conquistador Tomas to locate the Mayan Tree of Life for his Queen Isabella; this is also the plot of Izzys latest novel. Finally Tom is a space traveler in the 26th century finding the Tree and his destiny in a giant translucent bubble. At Venice the bubble popped and neither star could save The Fountain from a death sentence of boos at both the critics and the public screenings. The film was dismissed as an expensive waste of time (although another high-IQ sci-fi epic shown at Venice Alfonso Cuarons dystopic City of Men was reported to have cost between 80 million and 150 million). Weisz who earlier this year received a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for The Constant Gardener and became a mother seemed equally maternal in defense of her new movie. ""I think its wonderful that this film is so different"" she told the press. ""I would love to work with Darren again."" (Shed better say that. Weisz and Aronofsky live together and he is the father of her child.) The film had an equally risible reaction at early screenings in the U.S. It opens in theaters today. Or as they used to say about movie bombs it wasnt released -- it escaped. As I suggested these critical catcalls reflect less the quality of the film and more the prevailing fashions of the art-house intelligentsia in favor of bleak austerity dismissive of sweeping sentiment. But on its own terms this is a daring and impressive achievement. Unlike every modern epic from Star Wars to Harry Potter this one isnt spurred by revenge (you killed my father so I must wipe out your civilization). Here love is the driving force (I will do anything to keep you alive) making The Fountain the rare quest film with a hero as selfless as he is besotted. Izzy calls Tom my conquistador and shes not kidding. Neither is Aronofskys movie. Ever. Its a truism of the adventure film that audiences can take it seriously if it doesnt take itself too seriously. Play the material lightheartedly and viewers can enter into its world; play it straight and solemn and theyll get the giggles. The Fountain which with its opening chords announces its life-or-death theme (and life beyond death) has no time or inclination for comedy. Every line of dialogue each special effect all those portentous glances underline the desperate urgency of Toms enterprise to find a way to stop Izzy from dying. Not to minimize the importance of overthrowing the Galactic Empire or dumping The Ring in Mount Doom but shouldnt there be a place in the canon of epic films for a story about a man trying to keep his dying beloved alive? Kids who think theyll live forever might not hook up to this trope but adults should. Theyve certainly seen it before Armand trying to breathe life into the dying Marguerite Gautier or Romeo trying to shake the poison out of Juliet or Isolde going operatic over Tristan. The Fountain is essentially a classic deathbed scene at feature length and sustained intensity. Aronofsky brings every bit as much cinematic audacity to this film as he did to his first two building elaborate visual motifs Tree rings as a Mayan tattoo and as cloud formations; foliage that surrounds Tomas in the 16th century and grows through him in the 26th. Just as you didnt have to be a junkie to appreciate Requiem or a member of the Kabbalah to go for Pi you dont have to be moved to tears by The Fountain to admire its complexity. But I was. Those Old Hollywood romantic tropes still call to me. I was stirred by Jackmans delicate power as a man both grieving and driven spanning millennia from the Iberian past to the astral future to prove that love is stronger than death. I was impressed by Weisz commitment to the role of Izzy though it requires her mainly to shiver and sweat. And I was touched that Aronofsky who could have kept making spiky little art films (and that would have been fine) took a chance on himself and the movie audience with a love story that is likely to alienate his old fans and confuse the mall rats. I regret only that he cut the film to the bone; 96 mins. is a fine length for Scary Movie 4 but insufficient for all the ideas images and feelings Aronofsky wanted to cram into The Fountain. If you ask any director what the favorite cut of his latest movie is hell say the four-hour assembly -- and that trimming the film to manageable length is like hacking off so many limbs. (Presumably thats why Peter Jackson has added 51 mins. of footage for the DVD of King Kong which in theaters clocked in at an elephantine 3hr.7min.) In most cases what was removed would not have been missed. But here Ill wager theres a better fat film screaming to get out of this good thin one. I like and respect the short version of The Fountain. But I cant wait to see the directors-cut DVD.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Fountain Warner Brothers) B+ The Fountain Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Hugh Jackman Rachel Weisz Ellen Burstyn; Director Darren Aronofsky; Author Darren Aronofsky Ari Handel; Release Date Wide 11/22/2006; Runtime (in minutes) 96; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Regency Enterprises Warner Bros. Posted November 22 2006 -- 1200 AM EST Its no secret that The Fountain is a difficult picture. The fits and starts of the movies production were documented in EW a few weeks ago and even a viewer plopped down with no knowledge of the labors to bring script to screen recognizes early on in the bewildering proceedings -- when a 16th-century Spanish conquistador morphs into a present-day neurological scientist and then into a 26th-century spiritual cosmonaut all of them played by Hugh Jackman with pleading eyes -- that theres madness or at least a formidably dense narrative tangle afoot. The question a curious viewer must decide as centuries collide is whether to resist writer-director Darren Aronofskys romantic obsessive folly or to go with it. I went with it twice now and Im as touched and charmed by its failures (for clearly in the murk and repetitiveness of his intricate self-absorbed imagery there is something troubling the maker of Pi and Requiem for a Dream that has eluded his solution) as I am transfixed at times by its successful inventiveness and audacity. Theres something as recklessly okay about The Fountain in its imperfection as there is something undeniably cockamamy; its an entirely mood-dependent experience enhanced by identification with romantic/spiritual/kabbalistic/journal-or-blog-keeping tendencies of ones own and ruined by impatience. The triple-time explorer called Tommy Creo in the present sallies forth with one constant and its consequence and that is the love of a beautiful woman (played by Aronofskys real-life beloved Rachel Weisz) and the quest to conquer death in order to be with her always. Tommy (whose surname is Spanish I believe for ""I believe"") has a wife Isabel whom he calls Izzi (which is Brooklynese I believe for ""Is he or isnt he?""). Izzi is dying of a cancer that has reached her brain but left her alabaster skin radiant. Therefore the primate lab experiments Tommy and his research team are conducting are of particular urgency for the desperate husband; unexpected breakthroughs in anti-aging chemistry dont satisfy him if they dont also shrink tumors and he butts heads with his lab boss played (with her own fount of wisdom) by Requiem veteran Ellen Burstyn. Meanwhile backward in time Tomas the Conquistador sets out to discover the Fountain of Youth on behalf of his adored queen (Weisz again in royal gowns) who is herself threatened by enemies. And in the future Tom the spiritual seeker with a head as bald and calm as that of Mr. Clean floats in a translucent bubble looking for a reunion with his lost beloved and a kind of eternal wrinkle-free bliss. In all three guises from past hirsute to future hairless Jackman beams a handsome earnestness of such uncomplicated trust in the depth of the filmmakers philosophizing that its hard to imagine what Brad Pitt the originally scheduled Tomas/Tommy/Tom would have done to convey the same passion of purpose. Licked his lips cocked his hip and varied his stubble? The filmmaker is enthralled by texture. The Fountain often looks like velvet feels and the whole thing set to an ethereal score by Clint Mansell is shot by cinematographer Matthew Libatique in a rich chocolate light that makes a primal jungle booby-trapped with savage natives and even a sterilized science lab look dreamy as if life is lived in a perpetual nighttime. In one particularly sensual visual repetition tiny breathing hairs on the bark of the fabulous Tree of Life (Real? Symbolic? Let a hundred creation myths guide each viewers answer) rise up erotically to the touch just as Tommy is stirred by the hair at the back of his sleeping wifes neck. The director stages a couple of scenes with obsessive opulence. A jungle skirmish approaches the grandeur of an Indiana Jones epic while even Tommy and Izzis home -- a way station in the story hardly a destination -- is crammed with mood detail and a hint of Moulin Rouge decor to impress and distract the student who ventures to unsnarl the knotted strands of logic and faith that choke this Fountain. Im not convinced Aronofsky makes a compelling time-shifting explanation for the human hunger for eternal life when the present with a loved one is gift enough but Im perfectly content to float with him even if he doesnt solve the riddles of the universe.

With Jack Black Kyle Gass Tim Robbins Ben Stiller. (93 min.)Jack Black is wildly talented and I bow to no one in my admiration for his performance - thats right performance - in ""The School of Rock."" Hes a real actor. But his choice of material leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand his wanting to make ""King Kong"" but ""Nacho Libre"" was a dismal affair and ""Tenacious D"" isnt much better. Black and Kyle Gass started their acoustic/heavy metal rock music comedy act back in the late 1980s. Gold albums and HBO shorts followed now this. Still any movie featuring Jack Black with an appearance by Sasquatch is not a total loss and for those who care we learn the origin of the groups name. The answer is not for the faint-hearted. Grade CSex/Nudity 9 scenes of innuendo/nudity. Violence 6 scenes including child abuse and bullying. Profanity 144 instances including 120 harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 11 scenes including drug use. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Fountain (PG-13)Director Darren Aronofsky. With Hugh Jackman Rachel Weisz Ellen Burstyn. (93 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The only startling thing about ""The Fountain"" is the fact that it got made. You certainly cant fault Warner Brothers for playing it safe with this phantasmagoric head-trip flick. On the other hand some risks should be avoided. Just because ""The Fountain"" is different doesnt mean its good. In fact its borderline unwatchable though this hasnt prevented the Oscar buzz from buzzing. Hugh Jackman acting in three separate guises plays a man trying to save his dying wife (Rachel Weisz who in real life is married to Aronofsky). His journey takes him from 16th-century Spain as a conquistador searching for the Fountain of Youth to the 26th century as an astronaut. In between hes a modern-day scientist. Far out man. Grade D+Sex/Nudity 2 scenes; 1 with innuendo; 1 with implied sex. Violence 7 scenes including fights torture and graphic self-flagellation. Profanity 5 instances including 1 harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 1 drinking scene.Still in ReleaseCasino Royale (PG-13)Director Martin Campbell. With Daniel Craig Judi Dench Mads Mikkelsen Eva Green. (144 min.)""Casino Royale"" unveils Craig as the new James Bond and except for Sean Connery hes the best. The new film based on Ian Flemings first 007 book gets back to basics. Although the novel has been updated its still about how Bond debuted as Bond. Craig makes you aware of something that the Bond series in its pursuit of steamy sex and cartoon action quickly lost sight of 007 is a killer. Thats what hes licensed to do. Further evidence of a paradigm shift Bond falls in love with the Bond Girl (Green). Bonds first mission pits him against Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) banker to the worlds terrorists. By bringing ""Casino Royale"" into the age of global terrorism director Campbell risks turning the Bond franchise into a real-world fright show instead of an escape hatch for our action fantasies. But in the end its still Bond James Bond. Grade B+Sex/Nudity 9 instances including 5 with innuendo and 3 scenes of implied sex. Violence 22 instances including torture and explosions.

PICTURES          Hugh Jackman is scientist Tommy and/or conquistador Tomas and Rachel Weisz is cancer-stricken writer Izzi and/or Queen Isabel of Spain in ""The Fountain."" Opens today Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Fountain"" with Hugh Jackman Rachel Weisz Ellen Burstyn. Written and directed by Darren Aronofsky from a story by Aronofsky and Ari Handel. 96 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of violent action some sensuality and language. Several theaters. Theres something achingly sincere about the past-present-and-future mini-epic ""The Fountain"" written and directed by Darren Aronofsky (""Requiem for a Dream""). Its actors fling themselves into the drama with visible passion and commitment and its images are often stunningly beautiful. That said its also at times thoroughly mystifying though never less than engaging to watch. In the making for seven years the film has a three-tiered structure. Its main story is set in the present with a scientist named Tommy (Hugh Jackman) racing to discover a cure for the cancer that is killing his wife Izzi (Rachel Weisz). Meanwhile in 16th-century Spain Queen Isabel (Weisz) sends a conquistador Tomas (Jackman) through battle to find the Fountain of Youth. And far into the future a man (Jackman) travels to a distant planet to find the Tree of Life. All of this is the stuff of fantasy; even the contemporary segment seems to take place in another world of strangely dark operating rooms and picturesque dustings of blue-tinged snow. But Tommy and Izzis tale resonates as romantic tragedy so much so that its almost painful to watch. Weisz wistfully conveys a woman who knows shes slipping away and just wants a last walk in the snow; Jackmans Tommy seems distracted but not for lack of love. (In one scene he walks along a busy nighttime sidewalk in total silence -- until a screech of brakes reminds us that hes blocked the world out.) Izzi a writer is working on book thats connected to the other sequences in the movie; Tommy can hardly bear to talk about it. Its all done she says except the last chapter. Its a lovely movie-within-a-movie; the rest of ""The Fountain"" is intriguing but often puzzling. The Spanish segments though breathtakingly filmed (the throaty-voiced Weisz in elaborate 16th-century costume is dazzlingly beautiful; the camera seems to caress her) are presented with little context. And the futuristic sequences are even more so; often you just dont know what the film is up to. ""The Fountain"" would likely reward multiple viewings; at 96 minutes its curiously short as if its wings were slightly clipped. But its refreshing to be in the hands of a filmmaker with a unique vision and a pleasure to be challenged by a films flights of imagination.

PHOTOGRAPHS TO BE USED SOLELY FOR ADVERTISING PROMOTION PUBLICITY OR ... more Photo Regency Enterprise Pictures A toke-worthy search for fountain of youth 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Fountain Thriller. Starring Hugh Jackman Rachel Weisz and Ellen Burstyn. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" came out in 1968 word quickly spread that the best way to absorb its intricate meanings was seated in the front row stoned out of your mind. Watching ""The Fountain"" which is weighted down with philosophical musings about extending life forever you wonder whether it would play better in a marijuana-induced stupor with your eyeballs pressed up against the screen. In an altered state of consciousness would the transformation of a 16th century Spanish conquistador into a contemporary scientist and then to a 26th century astronaut all in search of eternal youth look like anything other than hokum? To find out however would require a second viewing of this well intentioned but incoherent muddle and it hardly seems worth the effort. Theres a reason Brad Pitt backed out of the role of time traveler Thomas Creo weeks before ""The Fountain"" was to start shooting and why Russell Crowe courted as his replacement decided to pass. It goes beyond the laughable predicaments Thomas finds himself in. As a conquistador he sports greasy shoulder-length locks while doing battle with Mayans in full headdress. Hugh Jackman who gamely took on the lead tries to project impending menace by looking down ominously but winds up looking like Wolverine. In the futuristic sequences his head is bald and wizened resembling Keir Dullea at the end of his space odyssey. The real problem with the movie is that despite writer-director Darren Aronofskys noble goal to do something startlingly original on an epic scale hes come up with a script that isnt particularly fresh -- Ponce de Leon was onto this fountain of youth thing in the 15th century -- or epic. In fairness he had to scale way back slicing the original 70 million budget in half to get the movie made at all. Cost cuts may explain the repetition of a scene in which Rachel Weisz as Thomas wife Izzi appears in his study attired completely in white and urges him to take a walk with her in the first snow of the season. He begs off saying hes too caught up in his research trying to find a cure for the brain cancer thats slowly killing her. The modern-day segments are the only involving part because they tell a love story audiences will relate to and because Jackman and Weisz convey the deep connection between husband and wife. Weisz is less convincing in her other role as Queen Isabel who ruled Spain during the Inquisition. She isnt queenly enough. Perhaps Weisz should have studied Helen Mirren as either Queen Elizabeth. Thomas runs around like a mad scientist injecting a monkey with an untested substance to see if it will shrink the animals tumor for which he is chastised by his supervisor (Ellen Burstyn in a small role to which she brings impressive depth). The tumor isnt reduced but the monkey miraculously appears younger. Thomas is on to something but it wont help Izzi who is growing weaker by the moment. The movie is overloaded with imagery. At times its stunning to look at but gradually becomes too much. Take the heavy use of mandalas -- geometric patterns with intricate centers emanating outward that are meant to symbolically represent the universe. Theres a mandala on the floor in a hospital waiting room where Thomas anxiously cools his heels while doctors attend to Izzi. After a while youve seen one mandala youve seen them all. Aronofsky flirted with disaster with his previous two films """" and ""Requiem for a Dream"" but managed to pull them off. Hes a hugely ambitious filmmaker and thats to be commended. But ""The Fountain"" never comes together. Like the time traveler at its center its all over the map. -- Advisory Mildly disturbing images.

Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz star in The Fountain. Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz star in The Fountain. Photo Warner Bros. The Fountain 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Before contemplating the sublime metaphysical head trip called The Fountain its best to remove your shoes and socks. Shave your head. Assume the lotus position. Exhale slowly. Ommmm. Now close your eyes. No bad idea; then you wouldnt be able to read. Just keep them open while you visualize this Hugh Jackman hairy and bearded as a conquistador fighting an ancient Mayan priest who tells him that ""death is the road to awe."" Hugh Jackman hairy but clean-shaven operating on a monkey brain as a modern-day cancer researcher. Hugh Jackman bald floating inside an orb with a sentient tree as they drift through space toward a golden nebula. He is like you in the lotus position. There you have it The Fountain a film that defies description summation expectation or any other -tion. Exquisitely beautiful and almost unbearably sad it is also -- no way around this -- truly strange. However strange you think it is its stranger. Plopping Hugh Jackman into a giant soap bubble isnt the half of it but its a fine place to meditate on the movies oddness. The Fountain is cinema as poetry; romance as revelation; science fiction as prayer. It ponders death and not as some pale Bergman chess master but death as a form of ecstasy. As a writer and director Darren Aronofsky has never been one to shy from either the morbid or the ecstatic and hes yet to make a conventional film of any kind. His most recent feature 2000s Requiem for a Dream concerned four addicts chasing different forms of bliss while his breakout Pi followed an obsessive math whiz on a quest to find the 216-digit name for God. In Aronofskys movies the path to enlightenment -- that ""road to awe"" -- isnt lined with wildflowers unless theyre sprouting violently from someones midriff. Yes that happens in The Fountain. A lot happens in The Fountain though its barely an hour and a half long. The monkey-brain researcher is married to a terminally ill author (Rachel Weisz a vision on her own) whos almost finished with a manuscript titled of course The Fountain. Her book follows Jackmans conquistador to Central America where hes been enjoined by Queen Isabella of Spain (Weisz again) to find a mythical pyramid that guards the Tree of Life -- which was hidden by God after Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden. Meanwhile inside the orb bald Jackman speaks to a tree (strokes it loves it eats it) while the two of them bob through space toward a star formation that might be Xibalba the Mayan underworld. Xibalba is where the dead find new life were told. And where the dying author gazes in rapture from the snowy roof of her home. Its no accident that shes named Creo Spanish for ""I believe."" Here Im compelled to say two things. First This is one outlandish film and many viewers will hate it. Hate. It. Second Its nevertheless a transcendent work of art a vision of undying love that finds hope in grief epiphany in death and life in the loss of Eden. Trippy visuals (inspired by David Bowie true fact) and an urgent score (by Clint Mansell with help from the Kronos Quartet) combine with a quixotic screenplay (by Aronofsky and Ari Handel) and Jackmans guts-bared performance to create a work both foolish and divine.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Fountain"" is either innovative science fiction or overwrought melodrama; I cant quite pinpoint which. I realize Im charged with reaching an opinion here but its not easy. The maddeningly brilliant director Darren Aronofsky crafts mesmerizing scenes of video and aural poetry yet stumbles when its time for two people to have a real conversation in real time. ""The Fountain"" is just a few edits away from being a memorable sci-fi oddity but in the end there are too many close-ups of Hugh Jackmans agonized mug to sustain all the overcooked emotion. No one expected a straightforward swords-and-spaceships epic from Aronofsky who plumbed the visual depths of depression and addiction in the squalid ""Requiem for a Dream."" Writing his own script Aronofsky said he began with the simple idea of a movie exploring someones quest for the fountain of youth. In ""The Fountain"" Aronofsky braids that metaphor from three main strands all keying on Jackman. In the present Jackman is Thomas Creo an animal surgeon and researcher experimenting with cutting-edge treatments of primate brain tumors. His wife Izzi played by Rachel Weisz is slowly dying of her own brain tumor and Creo pushes his animal research desperately in the hope it might render a cure for her. In the 16th century Jackman plays Tomas the Conquistador striving to save Spains Queen Isabella (Weisz) from the predations of the Catholic Inquisitor. Rumor and parchment map have it that a tree of life grows deep in the New World in or around Guatemala. If the brave captain could harness its power the Spanish empire would endure. Meanwhile we cut frequently to a bald Jackman floating in a bubble in space caretaker for a dying tree. The movies production notes tell us this is Tommy the astronaut on a quest to a distant nebula in the 26th century but the average moviegoer may find this quite confusing. The space scenes are exotically beautiful accompanied wondrously by composer Clint Mansells rich orchestral creations. But the space scenes also look more than a little goofy as Jackman assumes the lotus position and caresses the tree like a lover. To a cynic the bubble comes across as a flying yoga mat with a dirt-eating pilot. Still these scenes with the clean-shaven Jackman show his best acting range as hes finally free of the moppy hair that dominates so many of his roles. I wish Aronofsky had kept the convictions of his original mythology and gone further with all three stories. He seems to hesitate at the audiences potential confusion allowing Weiszs character to tie everything together by having her pen an unfinished novel called ""The Fountain."" These clunky turns have the scent of studio panic about them as if they saw all their millions frittered away on a concept too challenging for mass audiences. Like ""Requiem"" ""The Fountain"" puts scenes in your head that wont go away even if you dont ""like"" the overall movie. Aronofsky certainly has things to say - exactly what form works best for his stories is an answer still floating a few light years away.

"Fountain The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fountain-the ) Fountain The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli The Fountain is Darren Aronofsky trying to be Stanley Kubrick. However while Aronofsky is able to match Kubrick frame-by-frame for ending ambiguity thats one of the few areas in which The Fountain keeps pace with 2001. Technically this is an impressive motion picture but the fragmented story results in poor character development and Aronofskys clinical approach limits identification. The overall experience fails to satisfy on a basic level. This is one of those films its easier to be impressed with than it is to like. The Fountain takes place in three eras the 16th century the 21st century and the 26th century. The majority of the narrative transpires in a contemporary setting where drug developer Tommy Creo (Hugh Jackman) is trying to save his wife Izzy (Rachel Weisz) who is afflicted with an inoperable brain tumor. Izzy is writing a book about a 1500s quest for the Fountain of Youth in New Spain with Queen Isabel (Weisz) sending a Conquistador (Jackman) to find it. Finally there are flash-forwards to the future where a bald man (Jackman) is taking a space trip in the company of a giant tree. One of the objectives of The Fountain is to reveal the connective tissue between these stories. Theres little doubt this is an ambitious effort but one can argue that Aronofskys vision has exceeded his ability to bring it to the screen within the allotted running time. The Fountain isnt as perplexing or as profound as it would like us to believe. The conclusion rather than revealing some great truth or leading to a moment of transcendent awe comes across as little more than a quasi-mystical sleight of hand. The emotional content is almost entirely absent. At the core of the movie is Tommys desperate obsession to save his wife. However because the characters are so thinly drawn and poorly illuminated we dont connect with Tommys pain. We recognize it in an abstract fashion but it doesnt reach us. That puts viewers in the position of asking So what? The acting by Jackman and Weisz is fine and the visuals are striking without being ostentatious but theres a feeling about this movie that the Emperor has no clothing. However I would rather experience an interesting failure like this than a ""success"" that displays neither ambition nor vision. The Fountain has both qualities even if they remain only partially realized.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Top of Its Class The History Boys shows why Dead Poets Society was such a sham. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis Illustration by Paul Willoughby  (Photo Alex Bailey/Courtesy of Fox Searchlight) I ts going to be impossible for me to write about the film of Alan Bennetts elegiac yet rambunctious schoolboy drama The History Boys without (a) burbling about the power of the arts (and their teachers) to enliven our coarse and dreary existence and (b) falling into wishful British cadences. Indulge me wont you? The movie is brilliant and infectious much like Bennetts voice English-deadpan but never snide and generous to a fault. A playwright screenwriter novelist and diarist Bennett writes like a man who envies the passionate extrovert the gaga eccentric yet is grateful that he isnt a slave to the same impulses. Here his unruly single-minded hero is Hector (Richard Griffiths) a general-education teacher at a middle-class northern English public (i.e. private) boys schoolalarmingly obese given to declaiming poetry and living by a code of overload. His classes might be rambling but his students are fully engaged; even when they razz him they do so with sterling eloquence. Apart from a tendency to grope the boys genitals while carrying them on his motorbike he is a dream instructor. The History Boyswhich opens as a movie shortly after closing as a Broadway playtakes off from the resolve of the schools headmaster (Clive Merrison) to redouble his efforts to get his boys into Oxford or Cambridge and his engagement of an Oxford graduate Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) to prepare them for the entry exam. The youngish skinny Irwins perspective is bracing in its cynicism. He does not preach conformismjust the opposite. He denounces sheer competence. He directs his students to express a striking and original point of vieweven if they dont believe a word of what they say. Forget about Mozart he urges one boy Tell them you love Tippett or Bruckner. But I dont know them says the boy. The conflict between the two instructors worldviews sounds tidy but the work is too full of dissonances and exceptionsand wayward sexualityto be reduced to a morality play. Irwin isnt a villain (there are no villains in Bennetts work)hes wrestling with his own demons and his philosophy of exam-taking makes sense at least in the short term. A debate within the film revolves around the study of history. Hector relishes the subjunctive view by which he means that historical events might have played out in all sorts of ways. Irwin argues for a distanced deterministic appraisalhistory as a closed book. It would be a mistake to see Bennett as fully on the side of the childlike compulsive Hector. The History Boys suggests that his soul is divided his philosophical openness forever at war with his melancholy fatalism. He is certain however of how to hold the stage The History Boys is explosively alive even more so onscreen. The director Nicholas Hytner argued for getting the play on film before the exhilaration of the stage production had worn offbefore the actors delight in all that thrilling dramaturgy had faded with repetition. The action is fluidthe camera keeps pace with the torrent of thought. The torrent of hormones too. Virtually everyone is riveted by the darkly handsome Dakin (Dominic Cooper) who likes girls but likes being ogled by the tortured young Posner (Samuel Barnett) and is also queerlyso to speakattracted to the hard pragmatism of Irwin. The History Boys is a reminder of why Dead Poets Society was such a dishonest piece of deaths-head drivel despite its posture of life-affirming countercultural humanism. The movie showed soulless patriarchs driving tender adolescents to suicide for the crime of reading poetry aloud in the woods. It didnt have the guts to admit that along with that poetry there might be a circle jerk or two. A real Dead Poets Society would have the sense to reject a sanitized simplistic Hollywood melodrama like Dead Poets Society. Hector rationalizes his misbehavior by arguing that the transmission of knowledge is in itself an erotic actwhich doesnt wash with Mrs. Lintott (the splendidly tart Frances de la Tour) who brings the same acid insights to the movies history boys that she does to the high ideals of the warmongering boys of history. Against her Griffithss pale tremulous Hector has no chance of clinging to his life-lies. One aspect of The History Boys overwhelms its characters anguish and self-deception the vibrant soulful irreverent epigrammatic languagealong with liberal infusions of Hardy Whitman and other bards. How can we despair when Bennett allows his teachers and students and even his mingy-minded headmaster to express themselves with such poetic force? The real enemy is disengagementnot what is said but the unwillingness or inability to say it. The rest is never silence. Proof that the generosity of The History Boys is indeed infectious is my Alan Bennettesque affection for Darren Aronofskys lunatic Buddhist time-travel extravaganza The Fountain. Im glad he made it and I hope he got the Transcendental Messianic Artist virus out of his system. There is no storyonly a premise. Hugh Jackman plays a man (or really Man) at war with death in three evolutionary phases each intercut for maximum mystification. His sixteenth-century conquistador dodges Mayan spears en route to the Fountain of Youth (which becomes Genesiss Tree of Life). His 21st-century scientist labors to cure cancer before his precious wife (Rachel Weisz) gives up the ghost. His futuristic bald guy in the lotus position floats in a bubble in the general direction of the oneness of it all. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Backburnered four years ago after original star Brad Pitt pulled out then long in the making ""The Fountain"" third feature by one-time wunderkind Darren Aronofsky (""Pi"" ""Requiem for a Dream"") made more of a splatter than a splash on Venices Lido with its world premiere. Greeted by booing at its first press unspooling pics hippy trippy space odyssey-meets-contempo-weepie-meets-conquistador caper starring Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz suffers from a turgid script and bears all the signs of edit-suite triage to produce a still-incoherent 95 minutes. A gush of negative word of mouth will keep B.O. figures at a trickle. Overpraised for the then-hip now-dated use of pseudo-science in ""Pi"" and for the visual excess he deployed in the grungy ""Requiem"" helmer Aronofsky has been attached to and then detached from various big-budget studio projects over the last few years including ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Watchman."" ""The Fountain"" written by Aronofsky and based on a story by him and Ari Handel shows onscreen all the wear and tear of a personal project that has suffered from production fits and starts and reportedly has been cut down from a longer running time to a still tedious and repetitious hour and a half. Plot interleaves three stories in different time frames and switches throughout somewhat abruptly between them although auds can parse which is going on when by paying attention to how much hair Jackman is sporting at any given time. In the 16th century a bearded and long-locked Jackman plays Spanish explorer Tomas dispatched by Queen Isabel (Rachel Weisz) to the New World to find the biblical Tree of Life whose sap bestows immortality. In Central America Tomas must battle mutinous underlings and assorted growling war-painted Mayan extras to get to a pyramid that hides the tree whose powers produce floral special effects Tomas wasnt expecting. Turns out the latter storyline is the plot of ""The Fountain"" a novel being written in cursive hand in the present or near-present by Izzi (Weisz again) who is married to Tommy (Jackman again this time sans beard). Izzi has a terminal brain tumor for which Tommy is working full-out to find a cure via experimental surgery on monkeys assisted by a team of gowned-and-masked personality-free supporting actors. Only other character to make much of an impact is Dr. Lillian Guzetti (Ellen Burstyn the lead in ""Requiem"") the head of the research facility who is wheeled on from time to time to warn Tommy hes working too hard and getting sloppy. Compound extracted from a Guatemalan tree may offer a cure or at least some kind of miraculous healing power. Last plot strand shows a now-completely bald Jackman called Tom Creo per press notes living inside a clear bubble traveling through space toward the Xibalba nebula an astrological body believed by the Mayans to be the location of the underworld. Supposedly its the 26th century and Creos craft is driven merely by mind-power -- or perhaps more precisely screenwriters whimsy. His only company is a nearly dead tree from whose bark he gains sustenance while he spends his days reliving memories from the 21st century of Izzi and occasionally levitating around in the lotus position. Visual effects credited to a slew of different companies are indeed striking with their nearly 3-D layers of golden haze. However segment ultimately looks like a remake of the wormhole section of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" as produced by makers of instructional videos for beginning yoga students. More problematic is the fact that its hard to muster much engagement with characters who are so sketchily drawn. Izzi for instance is little more than a beatifically smiling presence. Weisz admittedly looks cute and pixie-like with a short-cropped hairdo but Aronofsky hasnt given his now real-life partner much of a role. Charismatic Jackman (and his chiseled cheekbones) does his best to carry the film through its many lulls but it feels like a lot of time is spent watching him cry or trashing offices in frustration. No doubt the filmmakers intention was to celebrate a love that transcends centuries hence repeated use of lines scenes and motifs. In the end however the effect is just monotonous especially given overuse of Clint Mansells mournful orchestral score slathered over scenes as if in hopes it will paper over the plots cracks. Nevertheless with savvy marketing ""The Fountain"" might yet find a niche audience especially with softer-hearted femme viewers who will groove to the picks rich costumes and honeyed tones.
