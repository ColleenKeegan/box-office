Daily Edition Login to download Kuma Berlin Film Review 343 PM PST 2/18/2012 by Deborah Young FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A cleverly scripted involving Austrian tale about two traditional Turkish women brings out the social perversion of the second-wife practice. TWITTER Director Umut Dags quiet drama which opened the Berlin Panorama tells the story of a village girl who is recruited as a second wife. An innocent village girl is secretly recruited as the second wife or kuma of a Turkish pater familias in Vienna with a practical eye to having her take over the household when his sick wife dies of cancer. The perverse simplicity of the domestic drama in Kuma a cleverly done not overly ambitious first feature by talented young Austrian-Kurdish director Umut Dag is heightened by young Begum Akkayas lovely and mysterious performance in her first major role. Making its weird premise seem plausible this quiet drama which opened the Berlin Panorama is well-positioned for both fest and some art house dates. If its hard for Westerners to swallow the idea of co-existing wives one suspects modern Muslims have a few problems too. Perhaps this is why Ayses (Akkaya) wedding to a nice anonymous white-haired gent is passed off as a much more appropriate marriage to his handsome son Hasan. Only the family knows the truth The pretty teenager is being shipped off to Austria as the old geysers second wife. No motivation is offered to explain why she agrees to such a thing and no money is seen changing hands. The opening wedding scene is all about village life and obedience to tradition. In Vienna the family must adjust to the new situation. The most gung-ho to have Ayse move in is Fatma (Nihal Koldas) the mother who is undergoing chemotherapy and will soon be operated on. She sees the frail girl as her care-taking replacement for her husband and five children when shes no longer around. Still preparing a sofa bed in the living room for the brides deflowering is a delicate matter and theres no getting around the awkwardness of those creaking springs as the family lays awake in the small apartment listening. Before long Ayse is pregnant. The childrens reactions (two are already grown up) provide a reality check on the surreal situation. Though they still wear tightly wound headscarves out of doors the two younger girls appear to have been born in Austria and to have absorbed many Western European values which dont include second wives for Daddy. With his perpetually downcast eyes and guilty look Hasan has his own reasons for agreeing to the fake marriage revealed in an affecting tete-a-tete with Ayse. Just when things are settling down a major plot twist sends the story rocketing off in a new direction. The second part of the film splits wide open in the kinky way Austrian films tend to do raising all sorts of embarrassing social questions no character is prepared to answer. Finally after all Ayses Cinderella-like masochism and self-sacrifice and the familys outrageous bad faith tensions explode in a highly satisfying knock-down fight that sends genuine old Turkish values flying out the window. The fine cast is exceptional in creating a closed-circuit world in which hidden passions can explode. Koldas mature performance is full of unspoken repressed feelings making an ideal foil for Akkayas blank-faced country goodness and apparently will-less compliance. The camera and tech work are modest no-frills.

The first Harold amp; Kumar film was a sweet low-key stoner comedy the second a crass slapstick romp and this third instalment falls somewhere between the two. Like the first movie its firstly a well observed tale of friendship as our estranged heroes (John Cho and Kal Penn) bond over bongs and blunts while searching for the perfect Christmas tree to appease Harolds Latino gangster father-in-law (Danny Trejo - who else?). As before the films strengths are two likeable leads a self-mocking cameo from Neil Patrick Harris and some witty observations on race in America bolstered here by a surprisingly inventive use of 3D. Its not quite smart or funny enough - and some of the gross-out gags cross the line - but for all its pretensions to bad taste this is surprisingly heartwarming festive fare.

Whatever their other projects the Harold and Kumar stoner franchise has become more popular than the burger joint that helped make it famous. A third instalment was inevitable.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Schoolmarm alert If the sight of Santa hitting a candy-cane bong doesnt jingle your bells by all means skip ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas."" If youre the type who enjoys dancing around a bonfire of mistletoe and yuletide treacle however get in line. This film will stuff your stocking with profane perverse politically incorrect glee. In their third outing Harold Lee (John Cho) and Kumar Patel (Kal Penn) embark on an adventure more daunting than scoring some White Castle munchies or escaping Guantanamo. This time they have to save Christmas after they burn down the 12-foot fir lovingly raised by Harolds father-in-law. The movie is nominally a reunion story reuniting Kumar who has kept to his slovenly pot-smoking ways with his old friend now a buttoned-up family man whose in-laws have made the nativity into a Martha Stewart-style orgy of tradition. Of course that reconciliation guff is merely the scaffolding for a slaphappy barrage of holiday heinousness. Every joke is designed to provoke someones indignation but context is everything and the multicultural trash-talk lands equal-opportunity punchlines on every interest groups chin. The fact that the leads are neither black nor white allows them to take potshots from angles we havent seen before. The bravura opening sequence manages to insult Occupy Wall Street protesters fat cat businessmen Asians fans of ""Platoon"" Caucasian dweebs anyone opposed to poop jokes and the entire audience who paid extra to watch the movie in 3D. Harolds sentimental but seething father-in-law is played by the fearsome Danny Trejo in a hall-of-shame Christmas sweater. I couldnt decide if the casting or the costuming was more inspired. Theres a fine line separating idiocy and brilliance and the film by-and- large stays on the clever side of the line. By now the Harold and Kumar movies have become an ecosystem of inside jokes throwbacks and running gags. If youre not already up to speed the appearance of Neal Patrick Harris as a cynical sleazebag alternate-universe version of himself might not make much sense. Still his high-kicking turn as the frontman of a crazed musical extravaganza stands on its own. He breaks the fourth wall to anticipate a fourth installment of the series and I hope it arrives. Its all so wrong that its irresistibly right.

"A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; a-very-harold-kumar-3d-christmas ) A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas (United States 2011) November 05 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Making an entertaining Christmas movie - at least one that can be enjoyed by anyone having gone through puberty - has become a lost art. Im not referring to a title destined to take its place among the timeless classics but merely something that might be as entertaining on repeat holiday viewings as during its first run. National Lampoons Christmas Vacation is an example of one such film. Although seriously flawed the Chevy Chase vehicle is the kind of thing that wont clear the room if you pop it into the DVD player on Christmas Eve. It wouldnt surprise me if future years slot the awkwardly-titled A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas into the same category. Although designed for an older audience than Christmas Vacation the goal is similar mix outrageous comedy with genuine Christmas cheer. If theres a complaint to be made its that the humor could be less scattershot. This is the third outing for the stoner duo of Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) the friends first introduced to us on their quest to find a White Castle hamburger joint in New Jersey. Years later after a side trip to Guantanamo Bay they have drifted apart. Harold married to Maria (Paula Garces) holds down a respectable 9-to-5 Wall Street job. Kumar having been dumped by his girlfriend Vanessa spends most of his time high while living in a cramped messy apartment. Fate brings the two friends together on Christmas Eve. Joined by Harolds new best friend Todd (Tom Lennon) and Kumars neighbor Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld) the pair navigates the streets and back alleys of New York City in search of the perfect Christmas tree - a 12-foot Frazier Fir with impeccable branches - while the clock ticks down to Santas arrival. They are once again aided by the immortal Neil Patrick Harris who did not die in the previous film despite evidence to the contrary. A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas (Ill drop the ""3D"" from the title since it will likely lose that when it arrives for home viewing) follows the template of mixing character development with raunchy humor. The movie isnt afraid to venture down some un-PC byways. Theres a subplot involving a toddler who inhales marijuana fumes gets coke blown in her face and eats Ecstasy like candy. A scene parodying A Christmas Story features a prosthetic penis. Neil Patrick Harris uses his image as a ""gay television star"" to make it easier to get girls (a trick he learned from Clay Aiken). And Jesus hangs out in heaven with a couple of topless angels. (The trailer has given them CGI bikini tops.) A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas never goes quite as far as The Hangover films but it comes close. Whats problematic about this is that the filmmakers have mistaken ""outrageous antics"" and ""envelope-pushing"" for ""funny."" This movie has its share of amusing moments but the comedy is sporadic at best. Director Todd Strauss-Schulson offers so many nods to previous films genres and styles that its impossible to name them all. Theres a Claymation sequence meant to recall the ever-popular holiday TV specials; it comes complete with a new ""Christmas song"" (albeit not one youll want to hear your children singing at the table). Neil Patrick Harris participates in a Busby Berkeley-style musical extravaganza featuring recognizable Christmas carols. And there are shots pilfered from action sequences (including one with a lot of raw eggs). It could be argued that Harold and Kumar showed little growth as characters in either of their previous outings. Thats not the case here where an attempt is made to round them out. In order to play in an ""adult"" world Harold has hidden away his fun-loving self. Kumar on the other hand is drowning in regret - a fact that becomes evident when Vanessa makes a surprising announcement. A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas is not only about how these two re-connect with each other but how they rediscover themselves. The most telling moment occurs when Harold explains to Kumar why theyre on the crazy Christmas tree quest in the first place. John Cho and Kal Penn have come a long way since their last outing as Harold and Kumar. Cho has entered the realm of big budget blockbusters with his re-interpretation of Hikaru Sulu in Star Trek. Penn joined the Obama administration after a stint on House. (These career moves are mentioned with winks-and-nods during the course of A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas.) Yet despite the lapse in time they slide effortlessly back into the roles. Neil Patrick Harris once again delights with self-inflicted character assassination. The rest of the supporting performances with the possible exception of Danny Trejo as Harolds unsmiling Christmas tree-loving father-in-law are unremarkable. While its hard to argue the 3D is essential to the experience there are times when it adds - rather than detracts - from the proceedings. For the most part it is subtly used but there are occasions when the old-fashioned in-your-face approach is employed. This mainly occurs with smoke rings snowflakes and a Claymation penis. Whether its worth the 3 surcharge is another matter but at least the 3D isnt a source of frustration as is too often the case with this format. For all its raunchiness and irreverence A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas contains enough holiday spirit that it can be used as a means to get into the Christmas mood. The soundtrack is rich with familiar chestnuts including staples sung by Johnny Mathis and Bing Crosby and the film has some fun with familiar holiday traditions (such as visiting a shopping mall Santa). Sloppy though it may be however A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas delivers what its fans will expect. And although it will undoubtedly play better to those who are on their fourth cup of eggnog its peculiar brand of Christmas cheer is accessible to all.

A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas Go See this Triumphant Return to Lunacy for the Stoner Pals. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 4 2011 435 PM A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas Go see this triumphant return to lunacy for the stoner pals. By Dana Stevens Kal Penn and John Cho in A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas Photograph courtesy of New Line Cinema. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas after youve seen the movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The most offensive thing about A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas (Warner Bros.) isnt the racial humor the nonstop weed jokes the fourth-wall-breaking Claymation penis or the toddler hopped up on cocaine and ecstasy--its the release of a Christmas movie only four days into November. But I guess trying to halt the march of the holidays backward through the calendar is as futile as preaching straight-edge sobriety to Harold Lee and Kumar Patel the hapless stoner heroes of Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (2004) and Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay (2008). The boys first adventure together was their best by far a ""one crazy night"" movie devoid of larger thematic ambitions than getting its two baked protagonists to Jersey for a hard-earned fast-food feast. Guantanamo Bays attempt at Bush administration satire fell flat but this third movie a proudly unambitious buddy comedy brings the franchise back to home turf both geographically and thematically. As the film begins the former roommates have been estranged for several years. Harold (John Cho) has sworn off the magic herb and done well for himself on Wall Street. Hes married to Maria the Latina babe he followed to Amsterdam at the end of the last movie and lives in a swank house in the Jersey suburbs. Kumar (Kal Penn) on the other hand still spends his days getting high and watching TV in the ratty apartment he and Harold once shared. On Christmas Eve Harold prepares for an onslaught of visiting relatives including his hair-trigger-tempered father-in-law Mr. Perez (Danny Trejo of Machete). Meanwhile Kumar gets a mysterious package addressed to his old roomie and decides to deliver it in person. Advertisement Cue a chain of mishaps resulting in the incineration of Harolds Christmas tree a 12-foot Douglas fir that his father-in-law spent eight years growing. Harold has until 2 a.m. when the Perezes get back from midnight Mass to find and decorate an equally majestic tree. For the next few hours (a brisk 89 minutes for the audience) the boys will find themselves thrown together in situations that steadily ramp up both in absurdity and danger level. Theyll total an SUV dodge the bullets of a Russian gangster (Elias Koteas) drink hallucinogen-spiked eggnog and find themselves onstage in toy-soldier costumes for the Rockettes Christmas show. That last is headlined by Neil Patrick Harris whose providential midcareer comeback began in part with his cameo role as himself in the first Harold amp; Kumar movie. Here Harris steals the show in a single hilarious scene sending up his real-life persona as a proudly out gay entertainer. In this movies conceit Harris is not only secretly straight--hes a lecherous ""cooze-hound"" who uses ""that homo crap"" to get public acclaim and lure trusting showgirls into his dressing room. Harris lightning-fast shifts between cloying public persona and debauched true self are nothing short of virtuosic. (Harris real-life boyfriend David Burtka also makes an amusing appearance.) A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas has some dispiriting laugh-free stretches. A subplot following the misadventures of the old buddies new best friends a tame suburban dad (Tom Lennon) and a tail-chasing nerd (Amir Blumenfeld) adds nothing to the movie and the ongoing gag about Lennons 2-year-old daughter inadvertently ingesting illegal substances throughout the night wasnt funny enough to justify its essential ickiness. But theres something about the two main characters--a stressed-out Korean-American overachiever and an easygoing Indian-American slob two friends who cant complete a simple errand without descending into lunacy--that transcends the movies they appear in. Because I enjoy Harold and Kumars company (or maybe just the company of Cho and Penn who are pals off screen) Im willing to forgive them a lot. The writing team of Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg who created the Harold amp; Kumar franchise has ceded directing duties to the first-timer Todd Strauss-Schulson and what this 30-year-old newbie lacks in structural sense he makes up for in boyish enthusiasm. The movies use of 3-D is deliberately goofily obnoxious with pot smoke rings blasts of holiday confetti and yes a Claymation schlong all hurled merrily toward the camera. And a subplot about a subservient robotic toy called the Wafflebot gained momentum throughout the movie getting more ridiculous and funnier every time the contraption rolled into view. This movie ends with the suggestion that Harold and Kumar may be mellowing with age. Though theyre not averse to sharing a low-key Yuletide joint their next unaccomplishable mission seems likely to involve buying diapers at Target. I just hope Neil Patrick Harris meant what he said when he took his leave of the boys in his Radio City dressing room ""See you in the fourth one.""

A book I wrote about them was published last year and over the last five years or so I have watched a lot of them. Were talking a stack of DVDs taller than Bing Crosby Rosemary Clooney Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen arranged vertically into an upright Human Centipede. So trust me when I tell you that ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" will hit most of the buttons you want pressed when you see a holiday movie. Its about the importance of family and friends the power of Christmas to reunite people whove grown apart and the redemptive power of the season. Its also about a giant claymation penis jutting out of the screen in 3D. This is after all still a ""Harold amp; Kumar"" movie. This series of stoner comedies has always managed to take political correctness and gross-out humor to staggering heights while maintaining a certain jovial sweetness -- even Santa Claus (Richard Riehle) tells Harold and Kumar that theyre basically good boys -- and ""3D Christmas"" pushes the envelope of tastelessness while maintaining a cheery holiday glow. If you werent a fan of their previous outings it goes without saying that this one wont be your cup of eggnog either. But if ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" or ""...Escape from Guantanamo Bay"" gave you the giggles without the assistance of herbal supplements this deliriously over-the-top adventure will send you to Bowlful-of-Jelly-ville. Six years after they incurred the wrath of Homeland Security our heroes are barely on speaking terms. Harold (John Cho) has the kind of Wall Street gig that has earned him the wrath of protesters (this movies 99% are egg-throwers mainly because it looks so cool in 3-D) and wants to impregnate his sexy Latina wife Maria (Paula Garces). Kumar (Kal Penn) meanwhile got kicked out of medical school for failing a drug test. On Christmas Eve Harold contends with the arrival of Marias extended family including her tannenbaum-obsessed father Mr. Perez (Danny Trejo wearing an impressive array of hideous holiday sweaters). When a mysterious package for Harold arrives at Kumars apartment he decides to pay his old friend a visit managing within minutes to destroy Mr. Perezs tree sending the two out to find a replacement. Before the night is over the duo will incur the wrath of a Russian gangster (Elias Koteas) accidentally expose the infant daughter of Harolds nerdy pal Todd (Thomas Lennon) to every illicit substance under the sun dance in full toy-soldier regalia behind a sex-and-drug-crazed Neil Patrick Harris (Neil Patrick Harris) and accidentally shoot Santa out of the sky. You know just another typical Dec. 24. Falling somewhere between Laurel amp; Hardy and Cheech amp; Chong Harold and Kumar manage to bumble into things through a breathless combination of bad decision-making and even worse luck. And while the proceedings here are less cannabis-fueled than in previous movies (Harold is laying off the stuff in case it inhibits fertility) the universe continues to deal them one bad hand after another forcing them to muddle through as best they can. Cho and Penn continue their breezy prickly chemistry after all these years -- theres even a throw-away gag about Penn having taken time away from acting to work in the Obama White House -- and Harris thoroughly debauched ""Neil Patrick Harris"" character remains as wickedly hilarious as ever. (Since ""3D Christmas"" is the first of the movies to be made after NPH officially came out of the closet theres a great gag involving the actors real-life partner David Burtka and why hes really hanging around.) Theres snow a musical number an animated snowman and a shout-out to ""A Christmas Story"" -- something thats not a tongue gets stuck to a frozen pole -- so theres no faulting ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" for not sticking to the Yuletide playbook. Think of it as the cinematic equivalent of fruitcake If you already know you dont like it theres no point in taking a bite but if you think youre going to enjoy it dig in and dont bother trying to explain why it makes you happy. Those grinches will never understand. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Its a film that opens with a fake Santa getting high and ends with the real one toking up. Its a 3-D outing that has the good sense to be properly filmed in the format only to still toss gratuitously inserted items towards the screen splattering eggs beer pong balls and the surprisingly effective waft of pot smoke each and every time one of these stoners gets well stoned. At the start of the film thats really only Kumar (Kal Penn). Having been kicked out of medical school and dumped by his girlfriend he has nothing better to do than get blazed a priority which has come between him and the suddenly suburban Harold (John Cho) since we saw them last. However once Kumar receives a package intended for Harold and drops it off with all the best intentions things go to hell all over again forcing the duo on Christmas Eve to find a suitable replacement for the Christmas tree that Harolds holiday-zealous soon-to-be father-in-law (a perfectly used Danny Trejo) had spent eight years growing for just this occasion. If you think their late-night quest is bound to go awry just as it had in 2004s ...White Castle and 2008s ...Guantanamo Bay then you wouldnt be wrong. The reluctant buddies have to contend with Ukrainian gangsters (led by Elias Koteas) stoned kiddies an intoxication approximation of classic Claymation and once more the timely appearance of Neil Patrick Harris as a stridently heterosexual version of himself. Making his first feature with series writers Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg director Todd Strauss-Schulson manages to send up both A Christmas Story and Platoon include a traditional Broadway musical number centered around NPH (naturally) introduce a readily adorable must-have toy of the season named Wafflebot and work in passing references to both Chos part in Star Trek and Penns work in the White House. The resulting hodge-podge of low-brow gags and winking humor is surprisingly spirited and has the distinct advantage of not being as immediately dated as half of the humor in Guantanamo already is. As is series tradition at this point African-Americans Asian-Americans and Mexicans all take turns knowingly embodying or subverting minority stereotypes while Christmas seems to work in a few more knocks at various religions than its predecessors had. (As part of a hypothetical diversion a young altar boy invites priests to join him for a pillow fight; Jesus Himself struts around Heaven with a topless woman under each arm.) And like the rest of the franchise to date it knows that outrageous humor and offensive humor need not be the same goal. Sure its taboo to display a toddler under the influence of first marijuana then cocaine and then ecstasy but its a bit that quickly wears out its welcome. Meanwhile Harris continues to work wonders with his one-note joke further mocking his public persona and demonstrating a depraved ferocity with the ladies to hilarious effect. Hes only around for two scenes though meaning that the brunt of the films charm once again falls on the pairing of Cho and Penn whose respectively responsible and reckless rapport still rings true in this most unlikely of sequels. All in all its a frequently funny return to form that embraces several universal truths that Harold and Kumar are better off together than not (for our sake if not their own) that stoner comedies need not be lazy with their juvenile wares and that the combination of waffles and robots is indeed an awesome one.

Harold (John Cho) continues his ascent at his Wall Street firm returning each night to his suburban nest where wife Maria (Paula Garces) greets him with a demand for baby-making sex. Med-school dropout Kumar (Kal Penn) smarting from his breakup with Vanessa (Danneel Harris) lives in his own filth blazing while watching reruns and scarfing down waffles. (Penns noticeably carbed-out appearance--and his job in the White House--is referred to in the films mostly-miss meta jokes.) Christmas is just a few days away further highlighting how much the two have grown apart Harold is consumed with pleasing Marias Yuletide-worshipping father (Danny Trejo); Kumar has nothing better to do than accompany the cretin who lives across the hall to a party where he has been promised the opportunity to deflower a virgin. A monster joint and a quest to replace a perfect fir tree in Harolds living room reunite them.Sort of acknowledging its own unnecessity A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas-- directed by first-timer Todd Strauss-Schulson and written as the first two H amp; K films were by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg--at least makes good use of the extra dimension. Clouds of pot smoke drift in front of your nose a Claymated dong nearly hits you between the eyes an arc of jizz almost lands in your hair. As in the previous installments some of the wildly inappropriate gags--like a toddler who ingests pot coke and ecstasy--kill as do many of the visual incongruities Trejos Medellin bruiser in a Christmas-tree sweater reveals the talents of the costume department.But where Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle and Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay gained focus--and potency--in sending up Bush II-era stupidity (and dumb crackers in general) Christmas has no real political targets save for a tepid brief acknowledgment of current class rage. The third installment still reads as angry but the ire comes across as self-loathing the filmmakers unable to mask their cynicism about their own project. Some of that disdain is manifested in the even more unpleasant treatment of ladies than usual and in Neil Patrick Harriss usual extended riff on playing ""himself."" Once awe-inspiringly outlandish NPHs bits have crossed over to merely curdled--nastiness that hits us with blunt force.

"A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas Dude thats like a total bummer |       NJ.com comments A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas Dude thats like a total bummer Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 04 2011 at 709 AM View/Post Comments Darren MichaelsFrom left John Cho Neil Patrick Harris and Kal Penn star in what is likely to be this yearas weirdest holiday-themed movie aA Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas.a Ah the wonders of new technology. At one point the makers of ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" use it to hurl a handful of excrement straight at the camera. Throughout the film its utilized to blow pot smoke right in our faces. The first is a good metaphor for what the films crude story does again and again. The second is perhaps a prescription for the only way someone might sit through it and laugh. The Cheech and Chong for a new generation ""Harold amp; Kumar"" debuted in 2004 telling the story of two very stoned New Jerseyans in search of a sackful of White Castle belly bombers. A 2008 sequel then sent them to Guantanamo Bay and later stranded them among some particularly backward backwoods people. In their latest addled adventure the two have grown apart. Harold is living in the suburbs and trying to start a family; Kumar is still stuck in their old Hoboken apartment trying to light his bong. But circumstances -- including the search for a Christmas tree a flight from an angry mobster and the inevitably strange encounter with Neil Patrick Harris -- are bound to draw them together. And make stone-cold -- or just stoned -- Hamp;K fans giggle. The rest of us though are likely only to sit there and shake our heads in wonder. Or mild disgust. ""Harold amp; Kumar"" used to have a what-the-hell multi-culti attitude mostly because of its easygoing leads John Cho and Kal Penn. But this film feels a little meaner and indulges in too many lazy racist jokes (gangbanging Hispanics Asians who all look alike) with the usual excuse of ""Hey were just being ironic."" Nor do a lot of the drug jokes play. Yes dude we get that Kumar loves the herb; were cool with that. But theres a whole subplot about a baby who gets accidentally dosed with pot then cocaine and finally Ecstasy. The toddler is so toasted Man its like hilarious right? Except um no its not. Its really really not. At least Neil Patrick Harris is a stitch once again playing a funhouse version of himself. This time the gag is that his real-life coming-out party was all an elaborate ruse; he only pretends hes gay so he can hit on ingenues with impunity. (Clay Aiken does the same thing he confides.) Its a good joke easily the best one in the movie. Theres also some interesting use of 3-D and one brief nicely demented sequence in which a hallucinating Harold and Kumar imagine that theyve become animated clay figures (even if the chance to really burlesque old Christmas TV shows isnt seized). But the rest of the movie is just well pot smoke blown in our faces and excrement thrown at the screen -- figuratively and literally. And thats no fun at all no matter how wrecked you are. Ratings note The film contains full-frontal nudity strong language and violence. Oh and drug use. Duh. A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas (R) Warner Bros. (89 min.) Directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson. With Kal Penn John Cho Neil Patrick Harris. Now playing in New Jersey.

Starring Kal Penn John Cho Neil Patrick Harris Patton Oswalt Director Todd Strauss-Schulson Running time 129 Release Opened Nov 4 2011  Editorial Review By Michael OSullivanFriday Nov. 4 2011Its tempting to suggest that viewers shouldnt go to see ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" - the third installment in the popular stoner-comedy series - without making sure they arrive pre-loaded if you know what I mean. But that would be irresponsible. Not to mention unnecessary. Theres so much on-screen drug use (enhanced by 3D imagery that enables characters to almost literally blow smoke rings in your face) that you get a kind of contact high just from watching it. Its a decent but not amazing buzz somewhere between ""Half Baked"" and ""Pineapple Express."" While not as funny as the original 2004s ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" its still a modest improvement over the 2008 sequel ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay."" And by ""improvement"" I mean that the humor is even more wildly inappropriate with a running joke about getting a baby stoned on pot coke and ecstasy and a scene inspired by the famous incident in ""A Christmas Story"" where the kid gets his tongue stuck to a frozen flagpole. In ""Harold and Kumar"" however it isnt a tongue - let me just say kudos to the F/X team. When we first catch up with our protagonists - former roommates and BFFs Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) - the two have gone their separate ways. Harold whose friends now call him ""Harry"" is a married banker living in the suburbs with his beautiful wife (Paula Garces). Kumar having been thrown out of medical school after a failed drug test is still living in the pairs dumpy old apartment where he appears to do nothing except get high all day. Well almost nothing - his ex-girlfriend (Danneel Harris) has just announced that shes pregnant. Through a complex chain of events - precipitated by Kumars attempt to deliver a package containing a banana-size joint to Harolds house on Christmas Eve - the two find themselves again thrown together in a series of silly misadventures this time revolving around the search for a Christmas tree. The subplot has to do with estranged friends reconciling and growing up - but not too much. The laughs are for the most part as lowbrow as they come. Theyre also hit-and-miss. The Claymation hallucination that results from Harold and Kumar being slipped a Mickey at a high school party? Pretty funny. The Ukrainian mobsters who subsequently try to kill our heroes after they are accused of molesting the mob bosss teenage daughter (Jordan Hinson)? Not so much. Fortunately the pace is pell-mell enough that the live jokes explode just as the smoke from the earlier duds is clearing. A self-deprecating Neil Patrick Harris of course reprises his role as a coarsened crazier version of himself. Fans of the actors previous ""Harold and Kumar"" appearances will not be disappointed. Other notable cameos include Patton Oswalt as a drug-dealing department store Santa Danny Trejo as Harolds hard-to-please father-in-law and RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan as a Christmas tree salesman. Now about the 3D thing. Although it makes fun of everyone under the sun - Jews blacks gays Koreans Indians Mexicans nuns Santa children and Jesus Christ - ""Harold and Kumar"" reserves most of its ammunition for movies themselves especially stupid 3D ones. ""Hasnt the whole 3D thing jumped the shark by now?"" Harold asks in one of several self-referential lines. (Another makes reference to Penns short-lived stint as a White House staffer a job he left to make this movie.) The answer if ""Harold and Kumar"" is any evidence is no. The movie makes good use of the technology to ridicule the technology itself tossing eggs ping-pong balls orange traffic barrels shards of glass and - at one point - a kilo of cocaine at the camera. Its silly silly stuff and the movie knows it. But if you cant laugh at yourself how can you expect anyone else to?

Hasnt the whole 3-D thing jumped the shark by now? asks a character in the often clever and intermittently hilarious stoner comedy ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas. Id answer arguably yes which makes this a perfect time to send up stereographic photography by hurling copious quantities of drugs bodily fluids candy canes and other wholly unexpected projectiles into the audiences faces. Fair warning that this second sequel to ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle (yes they return) goes out of its way to offend virtually everyone including Mexicans Jews African- Americans and especially evangelical Christians. In addition to topless nuns Jesus makes an appearance accompanied by a pair of topless female angels picks up a house phone and says ""Dad I need a favor. I havent even mentioned one characters plans to deflower a teenager named Mary on Christmas Eve a raunchy twist on the famous tongue-freezing scene in ""A Christmas Story -- or the toddler who moves in the course of one evening from pot to cocaine to ecstasy. These gags are hung like decorations on a plot that serves to spoof those dreadful holiday comedies like ""Christmas With the Kranks. Three years after sharing a joint with George W. Bush in the less funny ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay the more straightlaced Harold (John Cho) works on Wall Street where he faces protesters who hurl eggs and less pleasant substances into the camera. Married and living in suburban New Jersey Harold has cut himself off from the disaster-prone Kumar (Kal Penn) -- until his stoner pal arrives bearing a giant spliff that destroys a 12-foot fir custom grown by his ferocious father-in-law (Danny Trejo) whos arrived on Christmas Eve with a literal busload of Mexican relatives. Soon Harold and Kumars quest for a replacement brings them to Manhattan (portrayed with a wink by Michigan locations) and results in encounters with a Ukrainian gangster a ""Scarface-like blizzard of cocaine (accompanied by ""White Christmas on the soundtrack) and an accidental drive-by shooting of Santa. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg who wrote the first two films (and directed the second) will do pretty much anything for a laugh including referring to Penns real-life tenure as an advisor to President Obama. I was mildly disappointed that Hugh Lauries Dr. House didnt turn up to assist Kumar in patching up Santa. Not all of the gags work -- like a waffle- making robot or casting Tom Lennon as an Ed Helms-like character for a superfluous homage to the ""Hangover"" movies. But there are moments of brilliance like a claymation sequence that manages to simultaneously send up 60s holiday cartoons and ""Ghostbusters (with Frosty the Snowman instead of Marshmallow Man). There are a few lulls in Todd Strauss- Schulsons direction as the film reaches a climax in which our heroes play wooden soldiers in a musical production number with Neil Patrick Harris and a chorus line of ersatz Rockettes. Its hard to top that but ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas manages -- with Harris (who plays as usual a twisted version of himself) ""revealing"" hes only pretending to be gay to make it with the ladies.

Pictures From A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas - Hello Friend Hello Friend Credit Warner Bros. Pictures From A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas - Just A Couple Girlfriends Just A Couple Girlfriends Credit Warner Bros. Pictures ""Hasnt the whole 3-D thing jumped the shark by now?"" Thats the question posed early in A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas by Harold (John Cho) the more responsible half of the 21st centurys Cheech amp; Chong. The major movie studios may not be ready to accept it but the answer to that question is yes -- which is why its so refreshing when screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg wedge a winking acknowledgement into their film. By embracing the inherent silliness of whats still a gimmick at heart Hurwitz Schlossberg and director Todd Strauss-Schulson manage to use the technique far more effectively than most other films in the fads current revival. So if the notion of a Harold amp; Kumar film in 3-D immediately has you placing bets on how long itll be before someone on-screen takes a bong hit and blows a smoke ring toward the audience youre on the right track. Also bet that itll happen early because the filmmakers know exactly what audiences want out of this duo and are more than happy to deliver. Sex drug abuse a bizarre one-night quest a strangely endearing sweetness and a little commentary on racial stereotypes The right blend of those elements were what made Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle such a surprise hit in 2004. Their clumsy application in the 2008 sequel Escape from Guantanamo Bay made that film a disappointment. Thankfully Christmas sees the series returning to something closer to its White Castle form. The film opens six years after Guantanamo; Harold now has a wife a house and a high-powered Manhattan finance job. (In what seems a timely accident the films first big 3-D set piece involves a hilarious slow-motion action parody in which Occupy Wall Street-style protesters launch a barrage of eggs at him as he leaves his high-rise office.) Kumar meanwhile is still a dedicated stoner wasting away on a ratty couch. Their paths no longer cross and theyve barely spoken in years but a mysterious package left for Harold at Kumars door brings them back together. It also leads to the accidental destruction of a prized Christmas tree that Harold had promised his intimidating father-in-law (Danny Trejo) that hed take care of. i Bad Santa Neil Patrick Harris plays a twisted version of himself once again -- and gets a musical number to boot. Darren Michaels/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Darren Michaels/Warner Bros. Pictures Bad Santa Neil Patrick Harris plays a twisted version of himself once again -- and gets a musical number to boot. Darren Michaels/Warner Bros. Pictures So begins the nights quest as the pair -- along with Kumars sex-crazed new buddy Adrian Harolds nebbishy pal Todd and Todds terrible-2-year-old daughter -- go in search of a suitably perfect replacement tree on Christmas Eve. From here the film sticks close to formula and is perhaps a little too eager to go to extremes in order to shock at times. But the gleeful chaos of the night -- which includes waffle-making robots Ukrainian gangsters and the mischievous lampooning of A Christmas Story Woody Allens Manhattan and Rankin/Bass stop-motion Christmas specials -- wins out. Neil Patrick Harris turns up again as an abusive drug- and sex-addicted fictional version of himself but also gets to do a bit of song and dance in a holiday song-and-dance special that would do Busby Berkeley proud. Christmas may lack some of the surprisingly insightful subtext of White Castle but it never lacks for pure entertainment value. Strauss-Schulson directing his first feature is never shy about going for the requisite excess -- of either the franchise or the 3-D format -- and the two aesthetics blend perfectly in one sequence that has plumes of cocaine falling like snow as Bing Crosby serenely croons ""White Christmas."" Strauss-Schulson doesnt want the extra dimension to fade into the background as an afterthought; just as with the shameless showmen of 3-Ds original 1950s heyday his vision of the medium is unabashedly in your face.

Credit Darren Michaels/Warner Brothers Pictures Top athletes know it. Leading politicians know it. And with the opening of ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" stoners will know it too No matter how good you are at what you do theres always someone younger and hungrier coming up threatening to take your crown.Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) may be the kings of recreational drug use but in this their third feature film they are upstaged by a baby. This kid the child of Harolds new best friend is accidentally dragged along on a typically outrageous Harold and Kumar odyssey and child-welfare laws are left hilariously in tatters. Though perhaps more hilarious to some folks than others. If the sight of a baby covered in powdered cocaine offends you you are an idiot for having gone to a Harold and Kumar movie.Anyway as the film begins Harold and Kumar are estranged having each found new best friends. Harold is living a straight-laced married-guy life; Kumar is being Kumar. But a mysterious package brings them together again.The plot though it hardly matters involves the search for a new Christmas tree. The films director Todd Strauss-Schulson takes aggressive advantage of the 3-D format sending all sorts of things shooting out at the audience syrup snow streamers a hat and lots of wacky-weed smoke.Those who left the previous film in the series ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" during the closing credits may think they wont be seeing Neil Patrick Harris in this one since he seemed to have been pretty thoroughly shot to death in ""Guantanamo."" (A scene after the closing credits showed him shaking off the gunshot wounds.) ""N.P.H"" as hes often called in these films does indeed return singing and dancing. And talking dirty.He that stoned baby and a stunning riff on the tongue-stuck-to-a-pole scene in ""A Christmas Story"" will for fans of this franchise make this a blissful holiday season indeed.

Raw eggs confetti and a giant clay phallus are just a few of the stereoscopic missiles hurled in the viewers direction by ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas."" That recurring visual gimmick aptly sums up the hit-or-miss approach typical of this special yuletide edition of the likable stoner-comedy franchise scaling back its predecessors racially and politically charged humor to deliver a string of cartoonish often violently over-the-top episodes barely held together by the reliable odd-couple pairing of John Cho and Kal Penn. Brisk pre-holiday biz and strong ancillary potential should spell a fourth hopefully sharper outing down the line. After serving up a sly fable of minority empowerment in ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" (2004) and gleefully lampooning George W. Bushs America in ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" (2008) scribes Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg seem determined to avoid any hint of subversion here content to serve up a crudely irreverent holiday laffer along the lines of ""Bad Santa"" if nowhere near as scathing. For a movie that sees fit to have jolly old St. Nick take a bullet to the face mid-sleigh ride this vulgar romp is a generally harmless heartwarming affair a cinematic Christmas cookie almost sweet and flaky enough to cover the fact that its laced with hash cocaine and assorted bodily fluids blood included. To that end Hurwitz and Schlossberg have conceived ""Christmas"" in a spirit of bromantic reconciliation. Several years after the events of ""Guantanamo Bay"" uptight overachiever Harold (Cho) is now a Wall Street hotshot living happily in the suburbs with gorgeous wife Maria (Paula Garces). Its been ages since hes seen Kumar (Penn) whose weed addiction and slacker attitude have gotten him kicked out of medical school and dumped by longtime g.f. Vanessa (Danneel Harris). Still holed up in the filthy apartment he once shared with his old friend Kumar receives a mysterious package addressed to Harold and drops by his house to deliver it on Dec. 24. As luck would have it Kumar lights a giant doobie while on the premises and accidentally incinerates Harolds Christmas tree initiating a crazed quest through the streets of Manhattan to find a new one before Maria and her visiting family -- chiefly her intimidating Korean-hating father (an amusing Danny Trejo) -- return from midnight mass. Along the way Harold and Kumar renew their friendship and run afoul of various ethnic caricatures including a vicious Ukrainian mobster (Elias Koteas) and two tree-sellers (rapper RZA and DaVone McDonald) who delight in scaring customers with their angry-black-man act. While this politically incorrect humor is not without a certain self-awareness its disappointingly tame overly broad stuff missing the larger funnier joke -- the xenophobia Harold and Kumar repeatedly encounter despite their thoroughgoing Americanness -- that has distinguished the franchise from its lowbrow brethren until now. Elsewhere the slapdash comedy veers into sheer unpleasantness especially a toking-toddler running gag that soon winds up in ""Baby Geniuses"" territory. Among the more successful gambits are a graphic grisly homage to ""A Christmas Story""; a stop-motion animated sequence visualizing the mother of all acid trips; and of course the expected appearance of Neil Patrick Harris no less funny for being by this point so compulsory. Hamming it up as the star of his own Christmas TV special Harris again twists his public persona all but reveling in the opportunity to play himself as a rapacious horndog. By now Cho and Penn have got their Asian-American Abbott-and-Costello routine down so cold theyre a pleasure to spend time with even if the proceedings are less than inspired. The fresh cast additions dont fare as well; Tom Lennon and Amir Blumenfeld are wearying distractions as Harold and Kumars respective new best friends and Patton Oswalt is wasted in a blink-and-you-miss-it turn as a shopping-mall Santa. An early scene in which Harold is confronted by anti-Wall Street protestors hints at a promising topical angle but serves merely as the first of many opportunities to play up the stereoscopic element in the goofiest manner possible; so many random objects are hurled at the screen in slo-mo closeup that the results will be significantly draggier in 2D. Shot on often cruddy-looking HD the pic is indifferently helmed by Todd Strauss-Schulson whose video-short credits such as ""Big Pussy"" and ""Sorority Pillow Fight (With Michelle Rodriguez)"" no doubt recommended him highly for the gig. Given the general laziness on display its fitting that this is the first series entry whose title doesnt contain an active verb.

PicturesJohn Cho and Kal Penn are back as Harold and Kumar in the new 3-D Christmas film.Sponsored LinksWhile yuletide conjures up more traditionally wholesome activities this is closer to the prankster spirit of John Hughes Christmas Vacation except with a not-to-be-ignored R rating.Santa Claus gets shot Christmas carols are retrofitted with raunchy lyrics and most disturbingly a baby takes a panoply of drugs.MORE Kal Penn from the White House to White CastleFans of the franchise which kicked off with 2004s Harold amp; Kumar Go To White Castle and resurfaced four years later with Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay will not be disappointed by the irreverent mayhem. But its worth reminding viewers that few targets are spared -- including religion and race.This third installment has a timely scene of Wall Street protesters who come after the newly minted businessman Harold (John Cho). Meanwhile Kumar (Kal Penn) remains a stoner kicked out of medical school for failing a drug test. Theres a clever reference to Penns real life job in the Obama White House (he worked in the Office of Public Engagement until earlier this year).About the movieA Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas  1/2 out of fourStars Kal Penn John Cho Neil Patrick Harris Danny Trejo Paula Garc?s Tom Lennon Amir BlumenfeldDirector Todd Strauss-SchulsonDistributor Warner Bros. Rating R for strong crude and sexual content graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some violence Running time 1 hour 29 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe movie makes a big deal of how the two have grown apart of late. While Kumar spends most of his days ""not low"" Harold has tried gamely to mature He has married Maria (Paula Garces) lives happily in the suburbs and has given up the ganja. But Harold is not quite up to the demands of his wifes large family headed by the off-putting Mr. Perez (Danny Trejo). The patriarch presents his daughter and son-in-law with a cherished Christmas tree he has grown for eight years from a sapling. The moment Harold offers to decorate the tree while the family goes to church disaster looms. A marijuana mishap results in the prized Christmas tree going up in smoke. (After all Harold and Kumar are a latter-day variation on their stoner forerunners Cheech and Chong). Harold and Kumar join forces to replace the tree. But its Christmas Eve in New York City and things arent that simple. The guys endure a death threat from a Ukrainian mobster and are dragged in to perform in a holiday revue headlined by H amp; K regular Neil Patrick Harris in his third and funniest appearance.Harold and Kumars Christmas movie is silly if uneven fun. While it mocks 3-D technology it also makes relatively fresh use of it and qualifies as the most ambitious of the trio of films. It also pokes fun at tired holiday movie conventions. And for a three-quel about comically predictable altered states its plot offers a few surprises. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

His Indian-American not American-Indian friend would get kicked out of med school for failing a drug test then lurch off on arrant pilgrimages in search of the perfect joint. And Harold the Korean-American lawyer would tag along -- to a White Castle in the 2004 film and to Guantanamo prison and an encounter with George W. Bush in the 2008 sequel. Hed go on these trips because he and Kumar were pals and because every movie-comedy duo needs a straight man an interlocutor for the more repressed members of the audience and a reluctant participant in chaos. On meeting Harold one friend of Kumars says ""You never told me Harold was Asian. I always pictured him as an old white guy."" Exactly hes the grownup Kumar the reckless kid. But opposites also repel and years later the two amigos are barely on speaking terms. (MORE Top 10 Worst Christmas Movies) On this family-est of holidays Harold is preparing for a visit from the Latino relatives of his wife Maria (Paula Garces). Her tough father (Danny Trejo) approves of the candy canes but insists that the fake tree be replaced by a 12-foot Douglas fir that he has lovingly grown for this very occasion. It takes no Judd Apatow to predict what happens next. The candy canes and the tree come down along with every totem of Harolds propriety and the Yule seasons piety. This is the immutable law of farce all things precious must be destroyed. Sure enough anarchy instantly rules. Within minutes of Kumars arrival at Harolds home -- bearing a mysterious package that when opened reveals a massive marijuana stogie -- the tree is in flames the bay window smashed and Harolds happy domesticity in tatters. The Motion Picture Association of America has awarded Hamp;K 3D Xmas an R rating ""for strong crude and sexual content graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some violence."" Thats the merest precis of the movies offenses to which we could add naked nuns in the shower topless angels flanking a dude Jesus in Heaven a cocaine-fueled infant rude jokes about blacks Jews Koreans Indians and Ukrainians and for Christmas a foul-mouth Santa who gets shot in the face. Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg writers of all three Hamp;K films must have made a list of the major Christmas movies (A Christmas Carol) and TV shows (the Rankin-Bass Frosty the Snowman) checked it twice and worked hard to find scurrilous or sacrilegious twists -- like the scene from A Christmas Story where Ralphies tongue gets stuck to an icy pole. No prize for guessing which of Harolds body parts suffers the same indignity. In fond tribute to old horror series (Jaws Amityville Friday the 13th) whose only inspiration for their third installments was that they be shot in 3-D Hamp;K 3D Xmas hurls and sprays all manner of solid liquids and gases at the camera and into the audience bong smoke cocaine snowstorms and pellets baby poo and other bodily emissions. In a drug-dream in stop-motion Claymation (animated in the Rankin-Bass style by Fantastic Mr. Fox co-director Mark Gustafson) hot dogs and many a Star of David splatters the patrons; and a penis grows to Godzilla size to be used as a truncheon to pound the sensitivity out of any scrupulous moviegoer. The films smartest sight gag when something is thrown at the camera the lens appears to crack. First-time-feature director Todd Strauss-Schulson from MTV has the right attitude for low comedy. He doesnt (or maybe cant) distinguish between whats funny and what isnt devoting the same slapdash energy to both kinds and figuring the audience will decide. He also got his stars to behave and misbehave with gusto as if they werent sick of a star-making franchise they may have long ago outgrown. (Outside the series Cho played Hikaru Sulu in JJ Abrams revived Star Trek; and Penn under his birth name Kalpen Modi has worked as a liaison officer in the Obama White House.) As predictable and welcome as Frank Sinatras guest spots on Dean Martins Christmas shows is Neil Patrick Harris recurring presence in the Hamp;K films. This time hes the star of a Radio City Music Hall-style holiday show flanked by Rockettes as he sings ""Deck the Halls"" with a knowing eyebrow raised on the line ""Don we now our gay apparel."" NPH admirers will be aghast to learn here that the stars homosexuality is a ruse. In his Music Hall dressing room he persuades a buxom chorine to undress and starts rogering her from behind. (She ""But I thought you were gay."" NPH ""I am gay--gay for that [female kitten between your legs]."" Its a genially outrageous turn that wont scare Tony or Emmy show producers from hiring him as host. Harris mustnt think it harms his image one bit; his last line to the camera is ""Well see you in the fourth one."" A fourth Harold amp; Kumar? Who knows. But the third one finally wears down the disapproval of reluctant viewers with its cheerful demeanor and a late heart transplant. Sentimentality often creeps belatedly into farces but usually by knocking over the lamps in its clumsiness (cf. almost any Adam Sandler movie). Here because of the residual chemistry between Cho and Penn fellow feeling is part of the gestalt. Never to be mistaken for a Christmas classic -- or even strictly speaking a good movie -- Hamp;K 3D Xmas obeys one other solid comedy rule that after things are broken they must be repaired and restored. The lads are reunited with their ladies; the father-in-law accepts his daughters beau. At the end Bing Crosby fills the theater with ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"" as Harold and Kumar sit on Harolds front doorstep and the camera pulls back to reveal those candy-cane decorations remaining neatly in place. You see? Even a silly exercise in anarchy can be a respecter of a few Christmas traditions.

Slacker Kumar (Kal Penn) the son of Indian immigrants is still shitfaced on weed. But Harold (John Cho) his Korean buddy has made it on Wall Street (protesters are trying to occupy his office) and found a Latina wife whos ovulating. ""Fuck a baby into me Harold"" she squeals. You get my point. Were getting more of the same but less of the impact like weed from a bad dealer. Its not long before Harold or Roldy as Kumar calls him is high again pushing past weed into cocaine Ecstasy and crack. A new character the daughter of Harolds friend (Thomas Lennon) also gets to sample the goods. Hi-larious huh? The openly gay Neil Patrick Harris or NPH as we fans calls him again portrays himself as a shameless pussyhound. ""See you in the fourth"" he tells the boys hinting at yet another sequel.

They waft from the screen onto the lenses of stereoscopic glasses. Ordinarily one doesnt encounter this unlikely combination of low comedy high ideals and cheesy optical effects outside of a head shop. More about A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas >> With a scene change every 90 seconds and a gag every 15 or so this third installment of the Harold amp; Kumar franchise nearly funny as the first and funnier than the second succeeds in its heroic quest to leave no stoner unturned. Think of it as Airplane with controlled substances. Two nicely mismatched buddies are now estranged. They are the tightly wound Harold (John Cho) an investment banker with Occupy Wall Street protesters surrounding his office and the loosey-goosey Kumar (Kal Penn) who has a medical degree but failed his drug test. Harold now married lives in an upscale Jersey suburb; Kumar no longer with his girlfriend still lives in the Hoboken mancave he once shared with Harold. When Kumar exhales the 3D smoke gets in your eyes. Hasnt 3D jumped the shark? Harold asks self-referentially. Yes it has. But as deployed 1950s-style in this geek Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis romp with pot and peyote and ecstasy in place of Johnnie Walker it taps the funnybone. The 3D jokes are reliably funny. But another running gag the inadvertent exposure of an apple-cheeked toddler to every drug known to slacker elicits discomfort rather than laughter. The point of this apparent R-rated pointlessness is that its Christmas Eve and Kumar accidentally has incinerated the Douglas fir that Harolds father-in-law nursed from a seedling and brought East from California. Harold needs a new tree. Kumar needs his old friend. On this night of a thousand drugs one that involves encounters with tree salesmen pretending to be gangstas Russian mobsters pretending to be human and Neil Patrick Harris pretending to be straight the stickler and the slacker ingest more than the Hangover dudes. And yes H amp; K 3D pays a polite nod to that kindred drugathon as well as to A Christmas Story. How baked do Harold and Kumar get? So baked that during the movies first hour they turn into Claymation figures. So baked that stoner illogic saturates the film and the nominal heroes are displaced by a droid called the Wafflebot an automaton that looks like it was designed by George Jetson and dispenses waffles and syrup. (Where can I buy one?) The humor is rowdy rude and cheerfully crude the high jinks mostly inoffensive (albeit massively illegal). Director Todd Strauss-Schulson is good at simulating how those under the influence become helpless observers of the human comedy - much like the movie audience. Two cheers for Harold amp; Kumar 3D.

Its Harold amp; Kumar vs. Christmas and yes Christmas wins out. TWITTER The third installment of these mildly successful stoner comedies finds the rapidly aging stoners going up against Christmas and all its traditions all with an added dimension. The minds behind A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas werent kidding about that 3D in the title. Things come flying off the screen every few moments -- a flaming Christmas tree showers of glass lawn ornaments lots of eggs pot smoke exploding confetti and look out here comes the kitchen sink The third installment of these mildly successful stoner comedies doesnt so much work off a screenplay as a checklist Have we shown any spurting blood recently? Has a young child inadvertently dragged into the movies misadventures ingested any new drug? When was the last racial joke? Lets not lament how yet another comedy series has gone off the rails because this one really hasnt. Once upon a time -- that time being 2004 when Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle became something of a cult hit -- the joke was that heres a stoner road movie about a bookish Korean-American and an Indian-American party animal ethnic stereotypes filling in for the usual Anglo stereotypes who would inhabit these roles. The New Yorkers -- well played by John Cho andKal Penn -- ventured into the night seeking smokes girls and sliders at a White Castle burger joint. VIDEO A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas Red Band Trailer The Second Coming of Neil Patrick Harris Nothing has changed. After being waylaid by the lame Harold amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay in 2008 Harold and Kumar looking well past 30 -- the actors always played much younger than they were -- return for another nocturnal ramble that will increasingly move into surreal fantasy. But the situation for all the 3D claptrap remains essentially the same Two reasonably authentic characters tumble into a Wonderland of sheer nonsense. How funny this nonsense is will be found in the minds of viewers. So in this instance reactions will very in the extreme. A person could grow up appreciating the Marx Brothers Three Stooges and John Landis comedies and may still find this movies only funny line concerns Kal Penns brief career diversion into the Obama White House. Others will bust a gut laughing at the robot waffle-maker a desperate virgin Ukranian mobsters African-American con artists and a critically injured Santa. VIDEO John Cho Kal Penn Promise Holiday Cheer in A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas The script by Jon Hurwitz amp; Hayden Schlossberg who have written all three films shows desperation in the what-can-we-do-now panic that motivates much of the story. Like the White Castle movie didnt? Yet at the core of this movie lies a real problem What happens when former college friends drift away from each other? Harold has bought into the middle-class American dream with the deluxe house in the suburbs and a beautiful wife Maria (Paula Garces) albeit one who being Mexican and this being a comedy trafficking in racial stereotypes comes with a family headed by a father (Danny Trejo) and extended family that look like they stumbled in from a Robert Rodriguez movie. Kumar on the other hand is still a pot-smoking kid at 30 whose girlfriend Vanessa (Danneel Harris) would ditch him only she has just learned she is pregnant. A package misaddressed to Harolds former abode -- Kumars mess of a walk-up flat -- brings the two together on Christmas Eve and naturally disaster ensues. A Christmas tree ignited by an errant joint goes up in smoke necessitating the two men and their new ""best friends"" -- Kumars horny pal Adrian (Amir Blumenfeld) and Harolds suburban wuss amigo Todd (Tom Lennon) -- to hazard the nights many caprices to find a suitable substitute. No doubt serious substance abuse prior to the movie will make these adventures much funnier however there are occasional inspired flights of fancy including the movies sudden deviation into claymation with stop-motion characters all the winks and nods over the 3D Christmas and yet another appearance by Neil Patrick Harris playing a character called ""Neil Patrick Harris."" You might think of this movie as a lineal descendent of the Hope-Crosby road pictures which took two hapless characters into misadventures musical numbers and self-referential gags and in-jokes that played with audiences memories of past movies and movie conventions themselves. Its as harmless as it is stupid so neither the claymation schlong nor a seriously drugged child should offend. They will of course and indeed the filmmakers are counting on someone to think this is all edgy humor when in fact Cheech and Chong beat everyone to the punch years ago. (Up in Smoke is the best stoner comedy ever and thats the end of the discussion.) So A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas is like its predecessors a mildly diverting naughty comedy lacking the pure comic nastiness of Bad Santa or the sheer audacity of Up in Smoke. Tech credits achieve high marks -- whoops lets make that solid marks -- for the 3D shenanigans and the claymation by an Oregon-based company HOUSE Special. A shorts and TV director named Todd Strauss-Schulson made his feature debut with this movie and hasnt been mentioned until now because he seems to bring little personality or vision to this effort. The films success really comes down to Kal Penn and John Cho and the almost endearing idiotic characters they have created over these three films. Opens Nov. 4 (Warner Bros.)

Jones on 11.03.11 at 1000 AM Im pretty sure this is the first movie whose primary 3-D motif is people blowing pot smoke at the camera. After the disappointing Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay screenwriters Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg bounce back with this third installment of their stoner-comedy franchise; this time the quest plot involves Asian-American pals Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) chasing after a Christmas tree to replace one theyve accidentally burned down but thats only an excuse for the relentless barrage of tasteless gags most of them damned funny. Among the highlights are an adorable toddler developing a taste for cocaine Santa Claus getting shot in the face raucous parodies of A Christmas Story and the Rankin-Bass holiday TV specials and the usual hedonistic interlude with Neil Patrick Harris.

A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3-D Christmas Fair Director Todd Strauss-Schulson. Cast John Cho Kal Penn Neil Patrick Harris. Rating R for strong crude and sexual content graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some violence. This weeks new movie releases Christmas movies Which in this case means a ridiculous stoner comedy that upends a few conventions while working harder for laughs which dont come quite so easily anymore. What saves the film to the extent that anything does is that its aware of that fact. Well that and the innate likability of the two stars Kal Penn and John Cho. Theres a really funny bit during the inevitable Neil Patrick Harris cameo when he says apropos of nothing ""See you in the fourth one"" No doubt. Interview Kal Penn and John Cho Six years have passed in the movie lives of Harold and Kumar (though in real life only three years since ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay""). The guys have grown apart. Harold (Cho) now is a successful investment banker married to Maria (Paula Garces) who is desperate to have a baby. Hes especially stressed out because Marias family is spending Christmas at the couples home. If Danny Trejo were your father-in-law you might be nervous too. Kumar (Penn) meanwhile still is a stoner not interested in medical school. His life is pretty much summed up when he declines a party invitation because as he explains if he doesnt stay home and smoke the marijuana he just bought he wont get high. (I laughed out loud.) A package for Harold arrives at Kumars on Christmas Eve so Kumar even though he hasnt seen Harold in ages dutifully trudges out to his fabulous house in the suburbs to give it to him. Kumar accidentally sets fire to the beloved home-grown Christmas tree that Marias father has brought; the rest of the movie consists of the guys re-establishing their relationship as they try to find a replacement while Marias family is at midnight Mass. Also they shoot Santa Claus in the head and accidentally get a toddler stoned. Cho and Penn retain an easygoing chemistry so of course we hope they patch things up. Its fun to see Harris send up his image again. Its always nice to see Thomas Lennon who plays Harolds obsequious friend (and father of the toddler). And there are a couple of funny nods to the wholly unnecessary 3-D in which the film is shot. Fitting then because thats really the only new dimension on display.

"A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Harold amp; Kumar Christmas Stoner comedy sequel shows the buzz is gone a 1 1/2 starsNovember 03 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJohn Cho and Kal Penn star in ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas.""Comic effrontery is the Bic that lights the bong in the ""Harold amp; Kumar"" movies but willfully strained outrageousness can turn sour like that.For a definition of ""that"" theres ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" the weakest of the three.Here the boy-men -- now 30ish men-boys dealing with adult concerns and relationships in addition to their perpetual White Castle jones -- hunt down a Christmas tree mix it up with Ukrainian gangsters briefly turn into Claymation-type animated versions of themselves consort with virgins and meet Santa.And reunite with Neil Patrick Harris who leads a lascivious Rockettes-style musical number. Which has its moments. Unlike the movie surrounding it.The whole point of these films is that theyre scattershot and willing to try any stupid thing they can. (Todd Strauss-Schulson making his feature debut directed the new one in 3-D; it was written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schossberg who gave us the worthwhile one ""Harold amp; Kumar Go to White Castle"" in 2004 and the first disappointing sequel ""Harold amp; Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay"" in 2008.) A dispirited air however smothers the fun from the start this time. Tense bourgeois Harold (John Cho) and unemployed slacker Kumar (Kal Penn) reunite under duress and the movie engineers the realization theyre destined to be BFFs as long as the sequels hold out.They may be holding out but theyre not exactly holding up. The chief running gag concerns an infant who accidentally ingests a tremendous amount of cocaine and other substances over the course of the 90-minute misadventure. Is that even funny in theory?The first ""Hamp;K"" caught people off-guard with its canny idiocy and zigzagging picaresque treasure hunt premise. By now theres no catching anyone off-guard with these two except by way of the most off-color and off-putting means possible. Harris at least brings a cynical brio to his scenes. But the 3-D only makes the general not-funniness that much closer.mjphillipstribune.comA Very Harold amp; Kumar Christmas -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong crude and sexual content graphic nudity pervasive language drug use and some violence)Cast John Cho (Harold); Kal Penn (Kumar); Neil Patrick Harris (himself); Tom Lennon (Todd); Amir Blumenfeld (Adrian); Danny Trejo (Mr. Perez)Credits Directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson; written by Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg; produced by Greg Shapiro.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Most movies do nothing with 3-D beyond charge a few extra bucks for admission. A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas the long-awaited second sequel to the 2004 stoner classic does just about everything with 3-D. The film is distinguished by a glorious sense of excess. The operating principle seems to be ""Why not?"" Why not boast cameos from Jesus and Santa Claus? Why not take advantage of 3-D by having Danny Trejo ejaculate on a Christmas tree in all three dimensions? Why not throw in a Claymation sequence that quickly escalates from whimsical to apocalyptic? Why not riff on Neil Patrick Harris real-life sexuality in the darkest possible fashion? Itd be tempting to argue that Christmas elevates shit flying at the screen in 3-D to an art form but much of the films shaggy stoner charm lies in its aggressive artlessness. The filmmakers throw everything at the audience literally and metaphorically and the results are exhilarating rather than exhausting. Fresh off a real-world stint as a staffer with the Obama administration Kal Penn returns to his signature role of a stoner whose THC-based existence puts him at odds with old friend John Cho. As 3D Christmas opens a chubby shaggy Penn is steadfastly refusing to accept the responsibilities of adulthood that the married professional accomplished Cho embraces. The two estranged friends are reunited when a mysterious package for Cho is laid on Penns door and the two men eventually set out to find a Christmas tree in a quest thats every bit as epic and incident-packed as their maiden journey to procure White Castle hamburgers. Franchise favorite Harris returns as a crazed parody of his public persona. The film posits Harris public profession of homosexuality as nothing more than a front for his rapacious heterosexuality. Its an old gag redeemed by Harris split-second transformations from breezy gregarious charmer to dead-eyed vaguely feral sexual predator. The consistently funny surprisingly sweet 3D Christmas justifies both its questionable existence and its rampant indiscriminate and fun use of 3-D. And that friends is a true Christmas miracle.
