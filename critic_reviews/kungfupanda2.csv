Starring Jack Black Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson Running time 131 Release Opened May 26 2011  Editorial Review Kung Fu Panda 2By Michael OSullivanThursday May 26 2011Its finally here. At long last comes the second installment of the summer film weve all been waiting for -- the story of a dark prophesy an orphaned boy-hero and his showdown with an evil nemesis.No not ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2."" Its ""Kung Fu Panda 2.""In the satisfying if less than sensational sequel to the funny charming and action-packed animated feature from 2008 Po the panda (voice of Jack Black) returns in pursuit of inner peace the defeat of a murderous peacock (Gary Oldman) and the truth about what happened to his real parents. What? You didnt actually think that Mr. Ping (James Hong) the noodle-making Chinese goose from the first movie who raised Po as his son was actually our heros biological father did you? We need to talk.There always was that nagging -- and much commented on -- genetic impossibility at the heart of the original ""Kung Fu Panda"" How on Earth could a waterfowl have spawned a giant 250-pound bear cub? Daddys a bird for crying out loud. The new movie puts that question to rest. Its both a story about Pos search for his origins and a reckoning with the bad guy responsible for Pos identity crisis (Oldmans Voldemort-like Lord Shen). All this is set up in a beautifully drawn but harrowing prologue that shows Lord Shen -- in response to a prophesy that he will one day be defeated by an unnamed black-and-white hero -- attempting to slaughter all the pandas in the world in an effort to clear the way for world domination. Apparently he missed one.Call Po ""The Panda Who Lived."" And yes ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a little darker and a little more intense than the first film especially for very young viewers.Not that there arent some laughs too though Po is a little less physically inept and emotionally insecure this go-round having spent the last film mastering the art of kung fu. And its nice to see his menagerie of martial-artist animal friends reunited including Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Crane (David Cross) and Viper (Lucy Liu) known as the Furious Five. Dennis Haysbert also makes a welcome addition as a bovine kung fu master as do Jean-Claude Van Damme as a crocodile and Michelle Yeoh as a bearded soothsaying goat.Pos personal history notwithstanding the story offers little in the way of bombshells except for a surprise ending that holds out the promise of a ""Kung Fu Panda 3."" Visually however theres more TNT. Made in 3-D unlike the first film the sequel boasts eye-popping scenes of battle and the fiery furnace of Lord Shens workshop where he has built a powerful weapon against which kung fu is no match.Gorgeously animated the movie is a consistent pleasure to watch even if the outcome of Pos adventures feels like a prophesy that any one of us could have foretold. Contains martial arts action and some violence.

Three years later Black is the tiresome unfunny bore of Year One and Gullivers Travels his schlubby semi-improvised shtick grown stale. Could overfamiliarity take the sweet edge off our once-loveable hero Po?Luckily for Black most of his target audience is too young to care unlike many modern animations Kung Fu Panda 2 is aimed squarely at pre-teens with few of the ironic asides which have become fashionable in the post-Shrek marketplace. There are some dark touches - the biblically inspired backstory of peacock villain Shen (Gary Oldman) is really rather nasty - but overall this is a kid-friendly romp with mercifully few pretensions.The setting once again is a lost kingdom of medieval China mysteriously colonised by a global menagerie of random animals (gorillas antelope wolves even a rhino) with Californian accents. We find Po still honing his martial arts skills under the direction of diminutive Yoda wannabe Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) but his quest to find inner peace is interrupted by the evil ambitions of once-proud peacock princeling Shen on a mission to reclaim the throne by any means necessary. But our hero wont be able to defeat Shen or achieve true kung-fu focus until he learns the truth of what happened to his parents.Its this emotionally resonant subplot which is the films most memorable aspect Pos troubled but loving relationship with his adoptive dad Ping voiced wonderfully by James Hong is warm and wholly believable.And while Pos quest for his roots occasionally slows the action it pays off in a rewardingly melodramatic finale. Elsewhere the story is a mite haphazard Shens motives and methods are never entirely clear while our heroes plans to thwart him remain equally obscure. The smaller characters are often underdeveloped particularly Pos karate compadres the Furious Five. And while Po is a sympathetic hero Blacks freewheeling vocal mannerisms do begin to grate.But any such concerns go out the window once the action kicks off while the 3D rendering may make things a little fuzzy around the edges first-time director Jennifer Yuh handles the big set-pieces - notably a breathlessly paced cart chase through the streets of the capital city - with confidence. The result is a solid slice of summer entertainment forgettable perhaps but plenty of fun while it lasts.

"Kung Fu Panda 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kung-fu-panda-2 ) Kung Fu Panda 2 (United States 2011) May 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The average animated sequel is content to apprehend the successful elements from its predecessor and regurgitate them. The result no matter how enjoyable often drips with an overly familiar precipitation. Dreamworks biggest animated franchise Shrek suffered mightily from this problem. Thankfully the creative team behind the Kung Fu Panda movies has elected to move the series in a different direction. Kung Fu Panda 2 brings back nearly the entire cast of characters from the first movie but instead of recycling the original storyline screenwriters Jonathan Aibel amp; Glenn Burger and first-time director Jennifer Yuh use this opportunity to expand the main characters back story and explore some dark corners and crevices of the world in which these talking animals exist. The production is still family-friendly and includes the kind of easily accessible humor many kids (and more than a few adults) love about animated fare but theres no getting away from some of the adult themes that crop up. This is the most mature animated feature since Rango. At the end of Kung Fu Panda panda bear Po (voice of Jack Black) came into his birthright as the Dragon Warrior. As Kung Fu Panda 2 begins he is continuing his training under the tutelage of Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) whose latest lesson about finding ""inner peace"" is eluding Po. Accompanied by the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) - Po sets out on a mission to foil a group of bandits terrorizing a nearby village. The bad guys are after the metal needed by their diabolical master Lord Shen the peacock (Gary Oldman) whose Weapon of Mass Destruction requires it. In addition to having an unquenchable thirst for world domination Shen is deathly afraid of pandas; his soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) has prophesied he will be killed by one. So many years ago in an act possibly inspired by King Herod he attempted genocide of the entire panda population. When he learns that the Furious Five is led by one who got away he makes it his number one goal to capture and eliminate Po. The biggest narrative exploration of Kung Fu Panda 2 is to explain how Po ended up as the son of a noodle restaurateur goose. This story which is told via snatches of flashbacks is laced with tragedy. It also emphasizes the movies central theme of accepting oneself. Kung Fu Panda 2 also notes that the concepts of ""parents"" and ""family"" have less to do with genetics than with love and nurturing. These ideas may lack the sophistication one finds in Pixar films but they will resonate with many younger members of the audience. Jack Black once again shows his excellence as a voice actor. His rendering of Po is more likeable and less cartoonish than many of his live-action characters (including Gulliver in last years misfire Gullivers Travels). This may have something to do with the respect shown to Po by the screenplay which identifies with him rather than attempting to make him the butt of every joke. Black is complemented by a cast of mostly well-known faces. Theres some platonic (with possible future romantic implications) chemistry between Po and Angelina Jolies Tigress who like Po enjoys the introduction of a back story. Gary Oldmans voice alone makes Shen a malevolent entity. Dustin Hoffmans Master Shifu barely sounds like the actor; the same cannot be said of Seth Rogens Mantis. (Shouldnt he be playing a hornet?) Visually the movie is as good as any animated endeavor out there. Having seen Kung Fu Panda 2 in 2-D I cant comment about the 3-D effects but I can state the way I saw it offered a bright colorful palette that would have lost some of its luster when seen through a lens darkly. In additional to the usual manner of digital animation Yuh employs hand-drawn imagery (or an excellent facsimile) for many of the flashback scenes and a ""stick puppet"" style to present narrative background. Its a fun movie to look at especially without the encumbrance of the 3-D glasses. (In fairness to Dreamworks it should be noted that they have been at the forefront of making animated 3-D movies watchable surpassing even Pixar. Their How to Train Your Dragon remains the Avatar of animated 3-D.) Kung Fu Panda 2 ends with what assumes is a direct lead-in to Kung Fu Panda 3. Normally this sort of thing makes me cringe but if the same care to expand the canvas is lavished upon the next installment of this franchise the second sequel might be worth awaiting with anticipation rather than trepidation.

But images also persist in our memories and continue to move us in mysterious ways. Many of those in Terrence Malicks exquisite and also exasperating new film--his fifth in a career spanning four decades --are remarkable for their grandeur billowing volcanoes churning geysers hissing fumaroles spiral nebulas seen through the eye of the Hubble space telescope. Others are notable for their grandiosity When ""The Tree of Life"" goes over the top it sets altitude records. Some of the most memorable images though are the most fleeting curtains curving gently in a breeze; a newborns tiny foot surrounded by a fathers hand; a mothers lyrical dance of joy; a father switching off the night-table light in his young sons bedroom. ENLARGE Brad Pitt meets a new arrival in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life Fox Searchlight Tiny and vast eternal and evanescent these are the polarities of a work of art that defies categorization. (Mr. Malicks long-standing defiance of mainstream conventions surely helped his film win the top prize last weekend at the Cannes Film Festival.) Reduced to its essence ""The Tree of Life"" is a free-form meditation--strongly but not literally autobiographical--on the life of a family in small-town Texas in the 1950s. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are the husband and wife identified only as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien. Hunter McCracken is Jack the oldest of their three sons. (Jack is played as an adult by Sean Penn.) The three central primal portraits--father mother first-born child--are astonishingly vivid especially since theyre not conventional performances; the dialogue is sparse and the script dispenses with plot and overt conflict. (Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography ranges from creamy softness to stark majesty. Jack Fisk did the fine understated production design.) What we learn about this family--a lot--comes mainly from thoughts and supplications conveyed in voice-overs and revelatory moments of sweet pleasure hovering menace (how did any of us survive the daily dangers of childhood?) repressed anger explosive rage and through it all bewilderment and grief provoked by a sudden tragedy. Much of the film bespeaks the adult Jacks struggle to understand his mortal journey. What happened to the innocence of childhood? How did his beloved mother endure the pain that came to define her life? Before and after everything else who was the father he loved deeply and hated implacably? (In an admirably minimalist way Mr. Pitt gives equal weight to the fathers tyranny and thwarted dreams.) Jack is not the only questioner. Mr. Malick uses his film to ask the sort of existential questions that he has posed in such earlier works as ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" Why does misfortune befall good people? How can faith be sustained in the face of tragedy that is by nature incomprehensible? What of God? Where do we belong in the raging indifference of the cosmos? To set the larger context--larger being a colossal understatement--the film gives us a long sequence the likes of which hasnt been since Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (with special effects by Douglas Trumbull the same wizard who conjured up Mr. Kubricks marvels). Successive segments look back to lifes beginnings--this tree has really deep roots--and out to the rings of Saturn the moons of Jupiter and the infinitude that surrounds us paying special attention to violent creation and violent destruction. You do not come out of this film feeling like the king of the world. How you feel about that sequence may depend in part on your response to nature photography. As it started to unfold I was glad to let go of the family drama long enough to take in titanic vistas on a big screen. And I was touched by the technical simplicity of one particular glimpse of life even though the cumulative effect is somewhat ponderous; theres nothing like Mr. Kubricks stunning metaphor of the ape flinging up a bone that becomes a space station. But the film takes a far more problematic turn in a coda that expresses Jacks quest with surreal images of seeking and finding his way of reunion and reconciliation on a higher plane. Some will find this inspirational; as the last shot ended a woman in my audience called out a passionate ""Amen"" Others will react as I did with dismay --not because of the codas unabashed spirituality but because the banality of its images blurs the beautiful originality of whats come before. Yet ""The Tree of Life"" finds its own way taking nourishment from the grandeur and more than surviving the grandiosity. Daring in concept occasionally daffy in execution and ultimately unforgettable Mr. Malicks film offers a heartfelt answer to the question of where we humans belong-- with each other on this planet bound by love. Watch a clip from ""Kung Fu Panda"" starring Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. ENLARGE The hero of Kung Fu Panda 2 Warner Bros. Pictures Kung Fu Panda 2 The invention of fireworks quickly leads to gunpowder in this lively DreamWorks sequel and then to a secret weapon that threatens the hero with irrelevance or worse. ""How can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?"" asks Po plaintively. Hes the borderline-obese panda turned Dragon Warrior in the first episode and hes got his paws full once again as an evil peacock tries to take over China. No need to worry about him though and no need to wonder why ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" the directorial debut of Jennifer Yuh Nelson is so consistently entertaining. The movies not-so-secret weapon is graphic design. Hardly a scene goes by that isnt visually striking or kinetically thrilling and all of it enhanced by 3-D. The most spectacular set piece is what amounts to a chariot race through the alleys of a medieval city but the costumes and landscapes are sumptuous too and hooray for the idea that when orphaned Po dreams of finding his parents he does so in 2-D. The script could do with more dimensions; theres a surfeit of therapy-based stuff about lost love self-esteem and letting go of the past. Whenever the film lets go with an action sequence though its time to be grateful for computer animation and to keep both eyes peeled for incoming cannonballs. The highly anticipated sequel to The Hangover was released Thursday. ENLARGE The Hangover Part II brings back the original bemused gang in a Thai adventure. Dreamworks The Hangover Part II Its not a good sign that the frenetic denizens of this sequel to the 2009 hit comedy keep declaiming variations on the theme of ""I cant believe its happening again."" I wouldnt say that ""The Hangover Part II"" is a carbon copy of the original but only because no one knows about carbon paper any more. I cant believe how precisely everything does happen again except that what was fresh and surprising in Las Vegas turns rancid and predictable in Bangkok where yet another wedding is scheduled to take place. (The director as before is Todd Phillips.) This time the groom-to-be is Stu the dentist played by Ed Helms who is likened by the scornful father of his Asian bride to white rice pudding. Mr. Helms gets to do a funny riff on that description toward the end but its one of the few bright spots. Bradley Coopers formerly engaging Phil has grown vulgar and unpleasant Zach Galifianakiss Alan dispenses mirthless insults at every opportunity and Ken Jeongs effeminate gangster Mr. Chow is given much more screen time than before with even less justification. Not everything is slavishly duplicated though. Instead of waking up in a Las Vegas hotel room to find a baby the hung-over buddies wake up in a Thai hotel room to find a capuchin monkey. Make Believe Terrifically likable without trying too terribly hard J. Clay Tweels documentary follows six teenage magicians to Las Vegas where they seek the title of Teen World Champion in a competition that draws hopefuls from around the world. The title doesnt do justice to the film which is starting to play in theaters around the country. These talented dedicated kids arent making believe about anything--theyre making art out of shimmering illusion intricate manipulation and blithe misdirection. (In magic as distinct from filmmaking misdirection is a good thing.) Among the contestants are a boundlessly articulate and fatefully beautiful young woman from Malibu Calif. and a tender tentative boy from Japan who isolated in his rural village created his act and his performing self out of whole silk. Why one succeeds and one fails is a mystery more compelling than any we see on stage. DVD FOCUS Badlands (1973) Terrence Malick based his debut feature on a 1958 string of murders across the West by Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate. In his fictionalized--and aestheticized--version Martin Sheen plays Kit the psychopathic killer and Sissy Spacek is Holly his 15-year-old girlfriend who narrates flatly yet hypnotically. (Warren Oates is Hollys father.) Brilliantly controlled and singular in style the film has come to be viewed as masterly and the soullessness at its core as a commentary on American culture. Tak Fujimoto did the ravishingly desolate cinematography. A Little Princess (1995) Emmanuel Lubezki shot this enchanting film with all the warmth he brings to ""The Tree Of Life."" (Look at the color and the quality of the light for a better understanding of why cinematographers were previously called lighting cameramen.) Alfonso Cuaron directed from an adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel by Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler. Liesel Matthews is Sara Crewe the young girl forced into servitude at a boarding school in New York when her father fighting with the British forces in World War I is presumably lost in action. Its Kind of a Funny Story (2010) Zach Galifianakis is Bobby a patient in a psych ward whos as mysterious as he is funny and touching. Think of this small smart film as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" blissed out on Wellbutrin. Its the saga of Craig a depressed teen who checks himself into a Manhattan hospital and ends up surrounded by thats right screwy people. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara""; hes got a sweet spirit and a cockeyed Paul Simon smile.

It wouldnt be right to say that half an hour after ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" ended I was starving for laughs again. In truth I was starving pretty much all the way through. A lot of this movie is like an oxygen dumpling. But Po and friends redeem themselves with a terrific third act the animation (in three distinct styles) is superb and theres enough hiii-YA-ing to keep the kids yipping throughout. As you exit the theater be prepared to protect vital organs from low-altitude karate chops that slice the air at about waist height. The many pleasures of the first film included Jack Blacks buzzing nonstop jive as Po and the way his blubbery loser gradually became a Dragon Warrior. Now the character is as fuzzy as Pos belly Half the time hes kicking butt the other half hes falling on it. Moreover now that every ""SportsCenter"" host celebrity gossip and hepcat blogger rattles his vocal cords in fluent Blacktalk (""Thats severely cool"" ""Taste the defeat"" ""My fist hungers for justice"") its all starting to take on the air of a Tuesday night lounge act. In Reno. Predictable comedy is dead comedy -- and no you dont get a pass because half your audience is still mastering long division. Rug-rat chaperones are being asked to pay up to 17 for this in Manhattan. Them is grown-up prices. Still the quality of the animation is worth it. In a prologue presented beautifully to look like paper cutouts we meet the villainous peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) who as a youngster was banished by his parents because of his obsession with finding the dark side of fireworks. This element together with a sequence in which Po learns about finding inner peace from his Yoda-like master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) by mastering the ability to catch a single raindrop is essential to setting up the not unrousing big finish. Po wants to learn a little more about where he came from. Just as a for-instance -- why is Dad a goose? Father explains that Po is indeed adopted having been discovered in a crate of radishes but thats all he knows. Po is as hungry for more answers as he is for noodles. Meanwhile Lord Shen and his army of wolves are ransacking a town. Po and his five pals (including Angelina Jolies Tigress and Seth Rogens Mantis) come to the rescue although every few minutes its Po who needs to be saved usually by Crane picking him up as he plummets into a gorge. Kung Fu Panda was an advanced warrior at the end of the first film but now hes bumbling again because well making fatty fall down is this movies primary sense of comedy. Its a bit hard to be terrified of a peacock (the snow leopard in the first movie was way more sinister). But the animators are in charge and they succeed in dazzling with Lord Shens look -- just as they create a sly hand-drawn style for flashbacks of Pos youth. Action scenes such as a battle in a towering pagoda look splendid. Shen lacks size but does have heavy artillery. Hes been stealing all of the metal from the villages to produce a cannon with which he proposes to rule all of China. (Silly bird If he just made cheap junk he could rule the world not just China.) The pattern on Shens tail feathers breaks loose a memory Po has about how he was parted from his parents as a cub. He comes to suspect that he was abandoned. If so Shen and Po have much in common. The script could have done more with this idea Shen might have tricked Po into joining forces if for no other reason than to split the cost of a therapist to sort out their daddy issues. At the end of that nifty third act there is a warm emotional payoff that comes with a slightly alarming quantity of hugging. (Young cubs listen well Bugs Bunny never hugged anyone unless he had a lit stick of dynamite in one hand.) One worthy thing about Po though He is not faux. In his bounce and jiggle he contains the toddlers absence of self-consciousness the puppys anticipation of infinite joy Chris Farleys denial of limits. And unlike Farley KFP can go on forever. As long as he doesnt overdose on bamboo. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Oprah finale scores biggest audience in 17 years Read Next Oprah finale scores biggest audience in 17 years Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 31723 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 27400 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 16608 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" makes one thing clear from the get-go Lord Shen hes one angry bird. Gary Oldman voices the peacock whose pride may goeth but not before he causes a storm of destruction in the lovely sequel to the 2008 surprise that introduced us to Po. Jack Black returns as the voice of the pudgy panda who dreamed of becoming a martial-arts hero. Angelina Jolie returns as Tigress. Dustin Hoffman reprises Master Shifu Pos wise wry teacher. Along with the Furious Five Shifu keeps the peace in the optimistically named Valley of Peace. And his father Mr. Pings noodle restaurant has the memorabilia to prove it. Directed with verve and nerve by Jennifer Yuh Nelson ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" offers plenty of lessons about misreading destiny as the right to rule unfettered about parental love and disappointment about parental love and compassion. If you are looking for age-old parables recast against a vividly rendered world this kids flick bests ""Thor."" Without ever becoming too film-cultish the original paid homage to Chinese martial-arts films. Written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger the sequel goes further introducing younguns to the notion of ""inner peace"" and disclosing the heartache of Pos origins. In ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" the student has become the teacher as they say. Or perhaps the better adage would be ""the fan has become the celebrity."" Because gobsmacked Po has grown into his role as Dragon Warrior. Plying a yin-yang mix of humor and solemnity the movie teases us with melancholy then laughter. In so many ways an adoptees saga in the vein of Moses journey ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" touches on destiny upended and embraced. The evolving relationship between Po and his dad the silly (loving) goose Mr. Ping (James Hong) becomes as moving as it is funny. A disturbing flashback sends Po home with questions that link him to Lord Shen more than he imagines. While the movies insights wont necessarily strike chaperones as new they may serve as cozy nudges. Among them that a sad start may shape ones destiny but one can chose to steer it toward good or ill. And usually heroes have friends; villains have minions they shove around. The kung-fu quintet of Crane (David Cross) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and in particular Tigress are no longer furious about the rise of the at-times-still-clumsy Po. These critters make a formidable loving posse. Lord Shen having disappointed his parents surrounds himself with yes men and one honorable soothsaying bighorn sheep (Michelle Yeoh) whose warnings he consistently humbugs. The films visuals are thrilling beguiling vivid the greens of a glade or a terraced hillside; the molten reds of Shens smelting works or yellow-orange arcs of fireworks. The action mixes the kinetic with the calm adding one more pleasure to the endearing Tao of ""Kung Fu Panda.""

Lord Shen the evil white peacock voiced by Gary Oldman (Sirius Black in the Potter films) sets out to change his destiny by killing Po (Jack Black) who eludes him as a baby and now faces him as the kung-fu dragon warrior.Po does not remember what happened to him as a baby. We get a series of flashbacks done in contrasting flat cartoon style as compared to the lush CGI fullness of the rest of the story.Fortunately just as it starts to look like a retread the film shifts focus to an origin story that ultimately becomes like Disneys Tarzan an affecting adoption story. (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is coming fast on Pos furry heels with a scheduled release date of July 15.)Once Po learns the truth about how his loving mother gave him up to save him he sees what a great father he has in Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong) the goose who rescued raised and fed him lots of noodles.Despite the potpourri of serious themes the film is frequently funny. A witty script by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger is matched by director Jennifer Yuhs visual agility with sight gags which is splashily displayed in 3-D.Its hard not to laugh at round-bellied slacker warrior Jack Black as a Pooh Bear of a Po making all his jokes count. He happily remains an Everybear with a goof for each triumph. Thats whether he is making an impassioned declaration from a great height (only to find out that no one can hear him) or finding a unique way to slip into Shens castle by hiding in a dragon costume looking to observers as if the dragon is ""eating"" bad guys and ejecting them out the back end.Fans of the Furious Five warriors may be a little disappointed as their parts along with that of their teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) are muted in a tale that belongs to Po Shen and Mr. Ping. Still Angelina Jolie lends action-hero impact to the tough and serious Tigress one of the warriors who fights alongside Po in a common quest to save China and kung fu.For those who like the way this story focuses on Po they should really like the surprise ending because surprise -- not -- it sets up yet another potentially Po-centric sequel. If this takes off look for Kung Fu Panda Legends of Awesomeness a television series currently listed as being in development.Kung Fu Panda 2B+ Starring the voice talents of Jack Black Angelina Jolie Dustin Hoffman Gary Oldman Lucy Liu Seth Rogen and Jackie Chan.

Starring Jack Black and Gary Oldman. Directed by Jennifer Yuh. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a ghastly sequel to a charming animated film though it may take a few minutes for the bad news to sink in. Everything about the new movie is on a bigger scale - its in 3-D too - and up through the opening credits there is a hope that bigger might be better. But its not not this time. The first installment was unsentimental. This one wallows in false sentiment. In the original it was a cute thing that Po the Panda (Jack Black) is the adopted son of a goose. In this iteration Po is forlorn because he wants to find out about his birth parents. Ah but finding out about pandas turns out to be difficult we discover in that most of them - youll love this - were slaughtered by an evil prince (a peacock voiced by Gary Oldman). Thats right we get a little adoption anxiety and genocide in the movies first minutes. So of course Po has to go to war with the evil peacock and that folks is the rest of the movie. From then on its all battle scenes taking up at a modest estimate about 80 percent of screen time. Po has his posse the same crew from the last movie including Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and they go up against the evil peacocks army. Lots of kung fu fighting and explosions. Related Stories Kung Fu Panda 2 This is a just plain bad story peculiar and discordant to the extent its there at all but also so flimsy and uninspired as almost to incite contempt not just disapproval. But I know what youre thinking OK so the story is a bust but if the movie is funny and the visuals are good who cares? Alas this time there are about three or four mild laughs in the whole picture and the entire visual aspect of the movie is a botched disappointment. The choreography of the battle scenes is without wit. Its all boom crash and thud. And aside from a pre-credits sequence involving the peacocks and a later memory scene that is bathed in red theres nothing to see. Plus the movie seems to have been crafted with little understanding of the opportunities and limitations of 3-D. Its all quick cuts and a jumbled succession of images as though it were in two dimensions. There is not a single moment in which the three dimensions are taken into special account and used in an imaginative way. ""Kung Fu Panda"" was fun and beautiful to look at and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is neither. However it is the kind of movie in which the villain gets to say ""The only reason youre still alive is because I find your stupidity mildly amusing.""

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Kung Fu Panda 2 The Bear Necessities The sequel has a bright palette an amiable vibe and enough vivacity to keep kids entertained -- and any accompanying moms from bolting for Bridesmaids By Richard Corliss May 25 2011 Share Read Later Paramount Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The evil Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman) has just introduced gunpowder to China and plans to aim it at the countrys greatest martial artists a group that implausibly includes a pudgy panda bear named Po (Jack Black). Pos teacher Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) considers this a revolting development; as he observes mournfully ""This could be the end of kung fu."" And the panda a late bloomer in the discipline whines ""But I just gotkung fu"" When the DreamWorks animation auteurs get a concept they dont let go. Any hit DreamWorks cartoon serves as a product launch for as long a line of sequels as the public will pay to see. Theyve produced four films in the Shrek series (plus a Puss in Boots spin-off due this November); theyre preparing a third Madagascar for next June and have begin work on a followup to How to Train Your Dragon for 2014. Now theyve manufactured a 3-D sequel to Kung Fu Panda the 2008 comedy that is arguably (if Im doing the arguing) the companys finest animated feature. KFP2 reprises much of the humor and shtick from the wonderful original. Less an extension than a retread this Panda Lite hovers in the quality range of Disneys direct-to-video sequels to Aladdin and The Lion King -- except that ballooning budgets have forced these modest second chapters out of the DVD bins and into theaters to earn back the extravagant costs. But as directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson (one of the few women vouchsafed the solo direction of a big-budget animated film) and written like the first film by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger the new Panda has a bright palette an amiable vibe and enough vivacity to keep kids entertained and any accompanying moms from bolting for Bridesmaids. (See Richard Corliss review of the original Kung Fu Panda) Again the comedy relies on contrasting Pos idiot bravado with the classic poise and power of the Furious Five the quintet voiced by Angelina Jolie Seth Rogen Jackie Chan Michelle Yeoh and David Cross. This time though the Five dont get to parade their group coordination as they did in the original where they echoed the fantastic foot and fist work of the Five Venoms from Chang Chehs Hong Kong martial-arts classics of the late 70s. Only Jolies Tigress gets to register as a character; the other four given just a few lines each are reduced to backup performers -- Pips to her Gladys Knight. That wastes the time and talents of some fine stars and deprives KFP2of the communal camaraderie of these experts in kick-ass. By now Po has learned enough about the Tao of kung fu that when panic crosses his mind he says ""Im not freakin out. Im freakin in."" The major freak-in comes not from Lord Shens cannon but from Pos Luke Skywalkery search for his birth parents. Youll recall that his putative father the noodle-shop owner Mr. Ping (James Hong) is of an entirely different species. To the first films moral -- that you are who you have become -- KFP2adds a family-values lesson that Jolies adopted children could understand The one who raised you is your parent even if youre a panda and hes a goose. Kung-fu kudos to animator Rudolphe Guenoden for the imaginative action choreography and just for being there to Guillermo Del Toro (director of Pans Labyrinth and the Hellboy films) who served as ""creative consultant"" They surely helped make the film watchable; but the lingering impression is of a perfunctory sequel -- one made not to enrich the story or characters but because the first one made a bundle. Its called franchising folks and a ""new"" KFP has all the nourishment of another batch of KFC.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet At its heart Kung Fu Panda 2 has a bafflingly obvious fundamental structural flaw The opening sequence gives the ending away. Worse yet the movie never lets the audience forget it. During the scarier bits small children may be comforted by the frequent nagging reminders that we all know where this is going. But adult viewers--clearly an intended demographic for the first Kung Fu Panda with its copious martial-arts-movie references quick wit and real sense of threat--are likely to be disappointed at how much dumber broader and more obvious this sequel is. The original film was a compelling surprise an unusually fun and sophisticated take on the wacky-animal CGI movie. The sequel remains visually beautiful and strikingly designed but otherwise its a surprise in all the wrong ways. And its all highly unnecessary. The 3-D film opens with a 2-D history of a kingdom ruled by peacocks where the arrogant Lord Shen (Gary Oldman who makes a purring highlight of a villain as usual) decided to harness fireworks as an empire-building weapon instead of a harmless diversion. When a soothsayer (Michelle Yeoh) predicted that a black-and-white warrior would be his downfall he took out his frustrations on the local panda population which is how Kung Fu Panda hero Po (Jack Black) lost his parents. Periodically throughout the sequel Po flashes back to this traumatic event and tries to decipher his memories. The audience knows everything he doesnt so theres no tension to his efforts just a grating wait for him to catch up. And it doesnt help that no matter what Shen does the soothsayer keeps doggedly reminding Shen that Po is destined to kick his ass. Add in an early segment where Pos mentor Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) shows Po exactly how to save China from Shens militaristic ambitions and theres a deeply unsatisfying predeterministic vibe to Kung Fu Panda 2 as if its all just killing time while waiting for the described ending of the movie to finally take place. And it doesnt help that all the character business between prologue and conclusion feels rote rushed and sometimes delivered with the sloppy pace of an improv comedy. The stable of returning celebrities (Seth Rogen Lucy Liu David Cross Jackie Chan) and newly added characters (Jean-Claude Van Damme Dennis Haysbert Victor Garber) barely get a handful of lines between them with only Tigress (Angelina Jolie) speaking up enough to establish a sense of personality. At least the kinetic fight sequences from the first film return in force--but even that proves unfortunate since the film tries to mine terror from the idea of gunpowder as proof against even the strongest kung-fu master but it never properly navigates the ridiculousness of fighting a lightning-fast infinitely flexible adversary with a slow heavy hard-to-aim unpredictable cannon. Heres another prophecy Kung Fu Panda 2 will make a mint. (After the blockbuster success of the first film DreamWorks honcho Jeffrey Katzenberg revealed that a total of six Kung Fu Panda films are in planning.) The goodwill sparked by the first film will no doubt get grown-up butts into theater seats but theres going to be a lot more restless disappointed shifting among those butts than there was last time around.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 26 2011 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Paramount Pictures Po voiced by Jack Black is shown in a scene from ""Kung Fu Panda 2."" DreamWorks/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is somewhat better than its predecessor though not quite good enough to warrant what threatens to be according DreamWorks Animation another three installments in the franchise. Dream Warrior panda Po (voiced by Jack Black) is now older and marginally wiser though no less wisecracking. Along with his Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) - he is having a high old time protecting the Valley of Peace. Maybe they should team up with the Fast Five and combine franchises? A new nemesis intrudes Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) who wants to take over China with an ""unstoppable"" new weapon. In the course of stopping the unstoppable Pos search for his real father yields some dewy-eyed dividends. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? For a movie touting ""inner peace"" this 3-D sequel sure goes in for its share of battle scenes but for the most part they are excitingly conceived by director Jennifer Yuh Nelson and her writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" premiered at Cannes where Dustin Hoffman who once again voices a wise old guru was quoted as saying ""There is no inner peace in Cannes."" Wise man indeed.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 26 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday May 25 2011 343PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Hollywoods giant panda is in no danger of extinction. The second in DreamWorkss planned six-film Kung Fu Panda series arrives in theatres today and everything TV ads say about improved fabric softener is true of the KFP sequel Kung Fu Panda 2 is fluffier more huggably soft than the 2008 original. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" Movies Kung Fu Panda 2 The official trailer Now in 3-D the animated family film picks up where Kung Fu Panda left off. Roly-poly Po (voiced by Jack Black) returns an accredited Dragon Warrior at last assisted by a back-up band the Furious Five with more hand jive than the Temptations. For the uninitiated the kung fu quintet includes Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). Except this time out Po isnt quite the slapstick blunderer of old. Hes in a mellow place searching for his ""inner peace"" by seeking the truth about his biological parents while being extra careful not to hurt the feelings of his adoptive dad Ping (James Hong) a silly and perpetually nervous goose. Po even makes an effort to come spiritually close to the previously aloof and impenetrable Tigress. Spoiler alert They hug. Twice. At the same time this is a childrens adventure film so there is conflict and a skulking villain a vain peacock (Gary Oldman) with a fancy booming cannon and a fierce gang of followers who hope to destroy kung fu. After which as our designated evildoer puts it cackling ""China will be mine."" And yes the film boasts a few rowdy action scenes that take advantage of 3-D technology - soaring sweeping superheroes and whizzing cannonballs that seem about to put a new part in your hair. Still Kung Fu Panda 2 seems overly protective of its young audience. After the first big battle where Po and the Furious Five go up against what look like the lounge lizards from the Star Wars bar scene the film seeks refuge in a quiet Chinese village populated entirely by whiskered bunnies and eraser-pink piglets. There there now nothing to be afraid of rookie director Jennifer Yuh Nelson reassures little ones in the crowd. Unfortunately there isnt much to get amused or excited by here either. Oldmans peacock villain Lord Shen has lots of pigment but little colour. Po and the Furious Five dont enjoy the same boisterous camaraderie as before. There just isnt the same zingy rapport. Seth Rogens praying mantis and Jackie Chans monkey have no more than a dozen lines between them. Even Jack Blacks Po is more subdued. At times his spiritual quest for Inner Peace seems to have hit him like a tranquilizer dart. There are compensations to be sure. The animated pictures quiet travelogue interludes - rain playing on a thatched hut alongside a drowsy river the fading sun setting fire to the horizon - are glorious to behold. And the films end credits a Chinese flipping lantern trick accompanied by faster-faster music will send the wee ones home dizzy and content. But the kinder gentler Kung Fu Panda 2 will surely try the patience of older children and fun-seeking parents. Heres hoping that the next time out Jack Blacks Po discovers rock and roll. Or that he figures out hugging Angelina Jolies Tigress is good for more than the soul.

"Kung Fu Panda 2 review 3-D doesnt add anything to return of martial arts Panda |       NJ.com comments Kung Fu Panda 2 review 3-D doesnt add anything to return of martial arts Panda Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 26 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments DreamWorks AnimationThe ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" characters Po (voiced by Jack Black) center Tigress (Angelina Jolie) right and Monkey (Jackie Chan) are back in action chasing a runaway rickshaw. The roly-poly ""Kung Fu Panda"" returns for more adventures in a new sequel -- but like that kung pao chicken at the back of your fridge none of its quite as crisp the second time around. Once again the cartoon features the voice of Jack Black as our obese ursine hero (and a star-studded vocal support team from Jackie Chan and Dustin Hoffman to Seth Rogen and Angelina Jolie). Also some lovely Asian-inspired art. Even in 3-D though things feel a little flat. The story does feature a great new villain in an imperialist peacock as voiced terrifically by the hissable Gary Oldman. Also a personal crisis as Po the giant panda suddenly realizes that the goose who raised him probably wasnt his biological father. The two stories come together as Po realizes hes the survivor of a famous massacre dating back to when -- disturbed by prophecies of a black-and-white hero who would one day destroy him -- the regal peacock ordered all panda babies slain. Movie Review Kung Fu Panda 2 (PG) DreamWorks/Paramount (95 min.) Directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson. With the voices of Jack Black Gary Oldman. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains some mildly gross humor. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS Yes a 3-D cartoon about martial-arts animals is actually riffing on the Gospel story of the slaughter of the innocents. Not that -- thankfully -- the movie takes that parallel too far. Or takes anything too seriously as it bumps amiably along while Po predictably meets the challenge learns something about himself and ends the film with a big group hug. Theres a lot going on here. In fact at times the movie feels as overstuffed as one of Pos fave pork buns. True Black adds a lot to the movies comic texture and Oldman steals the show as the supercilious villain. But the supporting cast is simply too big while getting too little to do. Really who needs Lucy Liu here? Or Jean-Claude Van Damme? Any voice artist could have done half-a-dozen of these characters and better too. Still the littlest ones arent likely to care (or even notice that the 3-D often goes a bit dodgy in the corners of the frame). Theyre far more likely to simply delight in Pos antics which in the long tradition of chubby comics involves skillfully punctuating scenes of surprising grace with moments of extreme clumsiness. And to cheer when everything comes to a happy conclusion. But as for that final scene suggesting a ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is already literally on the drawing board? Grown-ups are likely to have a slightly more restrained reaction.

It was the high concept that launched a million groans -- this is what passed for kid flicks in 2008? Well lo and behold that tale of a tubby outsider discovering his hidden martial arts potential turned out to be a winning little cartoon with surprisingly well-crafted action sequences to boot. Cut to 2011 and Kung Fu Panda 2 which nearly matches the original in charm and kicks. At this point Po (voiced by Jack Black) has found his place among the Furious Five handily saving the day alongside Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Crane (David Cross) and Viper (Lucy Liu). However the arrival of vengeful peacock Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) has Po questioning his fuzzy heritage (pun semi-intended) -- after all having a noodle-cooking goose (James Hong) for a father is a bit of a tip-off that Pos parents have been long gone. Its half-mission movie half-identity quest as Po and friends set out to stop Lord Shen and while the introduction of a super-serious peacock as villain does merit some giggles his character proves to be a more fluid fighter than imagined and just as psychologically tormented as his opponent. Not to overstate it but Panda 2 devotes almost too much time on Pos repressed backstory invoking the cuddliest notions of genocide without terrifying the target audience. Adults who easily piece the plot together may grow weary of the prolonged revelations but its admittedly critical that affable naive Po not be driven by the same vindictive desires as our baddie by figuring things out too early on. With that said when its focused on a little less talk and a little more action Jennifer Yuhs sequel is on fine footing (and in its 3-D presentation it actually earns its surcharge by adding a welcome depth of field to already lush storybook landscapes and clear-headed combat scenes). None of the action set-pieces best the first films dumpling tussle or prison escape for example but the crews efforts to scale a toppling tower and Pos high-speed rickshaw chase through a local village prove to be equally inspired and dynamic in execution. The script by Panda 1 scribes Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger relies on a familiar gunpowder plot with which to give Shen his threat but it values character-inspired comic beats and knowing genre winks over the anachronistic cultural references that once defined the Dreamworks Animation brand. (Though the film does indulge in one sly video game reference its a nice sight gag for the parents to enjoy more than their kids will.) Whats curious is the structural decision to have our furry friend and the Furious Five defeated time and time and time again before ultimately gaining the upper hand as opposed to the usual solitary setback for our heroes. Again this isnt the bleakest film by any stretch but a curious effort has been made to undercut the day-saving formula and ramp the stakes up a bit more than usual. The returning voice cast doesnt bring as much verve to the table as before occasionally shooting for more emotional nuance instead (especially Black Jolie and Hong). Oldman is aptly menacing Dustin Hoffman is briefly sage as returning guru Shifu and Michelle Yeoh is nicely playful as a soothsayer while Jean-Claude Van Damme Danny McBride Dennis Haybert and others round out the ensemble with the ease that comes with a decent paycheck. Considering this is the first of five () proposed sequels Kung Fu Panda 2 could have fared a bit worse. At least for now the adventures of our hungry hungry hero still feel fresh and fun and one can only hope that his forthcoming exploits will prove to be just as disarming.

(Dreamworks) Joe Neumaier Thursday May 26 2011 400 AM Title Kung Fu Panda 2 A martial arts-loving panda discovers his own past. With the voices of Jack Black Angelina Jolie Gary Oldman. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson. (131) PG Animated violence. At area theaters. In 3-D where available. Were living in a golden age for family entertainment. Practically every month films filled with technological advancements and sterling storytelling are creating a generation of young moviegoers wise about genres and styles and fortunate enough to be able to pick and choose. In that case ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" plunks down squarely in the spot marked for ""chop-socky action with heart."" Yes some of its lightning-fast fighting styles seem borrowed from videogame aesthetics but director Jennifer Yuh Nelsons true cannon fist is how seamlessly ""Pandas"" wild skirmishes mesh with its eloquent narrative even if there are less pauses for reflection this time round. As he was at the end of the 2008 original plump dumpling-loving Po (Jack Black) is continuing his Dragon Warrior tutelage with Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) when a new threat to Chinas harmony emerges Lord Shen an evil peacock whose peace-loving parents were fireworks artisans. It was foretold that Shen would rule unchallenged until a black-and-white mammal from a nearby village would defeat him. So Shen slaughters all the villages pandas an act that leaves him banished. His revenge will come by way of a fireworks cannon created to destroy all kung fu. Years later as Shens minions arrive at the foot of Shifus mountain Po and the Furious Five -- Tigress Viper Monkey Crane and Mantis -- get their fu on. Then something triggers a buried memory within Po which turns the mission into a journey to discover his past. Aside from crisp visuals and no-fat way with martial arts movie traditions the biggest achievement of the ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies is how they distill their stars very Jack Black-ness down to its most bearable form. Always the wildest guy in the room Black has turned into a living ""Gullivers Travels."" Yet here as in the first ""KFP"" he gives a charmingly vulnerable but sly vocal performance with plenty of sass and a decent side order of soul. Angelina Jolies fierce Tigress has a bigger role as soon as the fur starts flying though the general absence of Hoffmans silken-robed Shifu creates a void. Still Shifu is around long enough to impart some crucial wisdom about inner peace and self-acceptance that viewers as young as 6 will be able to grasp. All the iron-pawed battles and tangled tails of destruction cannot obscure such a noble lesson. Stay Awake For The wild rickshaw race that comes 20 minutes into a chase between the Furious Five and some nasty wolves. In 3-D its extra furious.

Or vice versa. DreamWorks Animation (Jack Black) and Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) receive troubling news about Lord Shens plan to take over China. EnlargeClose DreamWorks Animation (Jack Black) and Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) receive troubling news about Lord Shens plan to take over China. Either way this winning sequel to 2008s martial arts cartoon makes deft moves for a big-budget sequel -- and is even warmly reminiscent of 1980s The Empire Strikes Back. Like Luke Skywalker Po (voiced by Jack Black) is raised by surrogates but yearns to know the truth about his biological father. Like Empire Panda is an unabashed setup to a third film. Even Hans Zimmers wonderful soundtrack recalls Darth Vaders Imperial March theme. Yet it still feels fresh the second time around for our pudgy warrior. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson who worked as an artist and writer on the first film takes care to evolve characters instead of running them through the same maze. (Are you listening Hangover II folks?) VIDEOWatch the trailer STORYKung Fu Panda 2 premiere PHOTOJack Black and Angelina Jolie Po reassembles his supporting cast the Furious Five-- Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) -- to confront Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) who plans to wipe out kung fu entirely. Instead of focusing on the showdown writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger make the battle a backdrop and explore Pos abandonment issues. Its not deep stuff and wont bore the kids. Easing Po across the emotional crevasse is the diminutive master Shifu voiced by Dustin Hoffman and looking and mumbling like Yoda. (If this isnt intentional its a weird coincidence.) About the film Kung Fu Panda 2    out of four Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson Stars Jack Black Angelina Jolie Seth Rogen Rated PG for sequences of martial arts action and mild violence Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Distributor Paramount Studios/DreamWorks Opens nationwide Thursday The film features some beautiful animation and the story hums along as the Furious Five and the gleefully wicked Shen head for an inevitable clash. The 3-D is a harmless additive. Kids will love the opening sequence and battle scenes though parents may not find it worth 90 minutes of glasses discomfort. If Panda has a weakness its more the films genre than its story. As Hollywood opens the floodgates to high-priced cartoons the limits of family animation become evident. Namely that most stories draw from the same moral well Never give up on a dream and family need not be blood-related. Panda provides both lessons without sounding preachy. Black is clearly suited for the role of a modern-day Inspector Clouseau a hero clown who cant help but save the day. And the message is undeniably sweet. It may not tread new narrative ground but Panda echoes some worthy tales that parents heard a long time ago at a theater far far away.

"Movie review Kung Fu Panda 2 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AnimationMovie review Kung Fu Panda 2Po returns in fine paunchy form under Jennifer Yuh Nelsons direction.May 26 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Criti Monkey the voice of Jackie Chan; Crane the voice of David Cross; Po the... (Courtesy of DreamWorks...)Dont let the plush paunch gurgling tummy or the occasional comic aside fool you -- theres a restless dragon warrior just itching to break some heads in ""Kung Fu Panda 2."" Po still kicking and snacking and channeling Jack Black believes hes the panda to do it. Master Shifu who carries within him the wisdom of the ages and Dustin Hoffmans pipes is not so sure. All of which makes for a lot of tension and boundary pushing in this frothy brothy noodle-and-action-packed second chapter of the 2008 animated hit ""Kung Fu Panda"" a rich vision of ancient China with warlords Zen masters old grudges and just a dash of modern day awesome. This is one raucous animal kingdom no humans allowed. The story written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger is pretty standard childhood fare -- believe in yourself family is what you make it watch out for peacocks. Its the 3-D animation under the spell of director Jennifer Yuh Nelson thats such a surprise. Not that a woman is flying solo on a major animated project -- although that is nearly as rare as the Hope diamond -- rather that this is the first movie in a long time that you wont mind paying for the glasses because whats on the screen is multidimensional magic. When we last saw Po he was still honing all the right moves. As ""Panda 2"" opens hes gotten a lot better. The rest of the class of 2008 is back too that would be the Furious Five which sadly does not include Vin Diesel but does feature a fearsome bunch in Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). Soon word comes to the Valley of Peace telling of the rise of Lord Shen Gary Oldman as a peacock whose mommy and daddy issues have his feathers in a twist. He has developed weapons so brutal cannons so incredible that it may spell the end of kung fu to say nothing of an entire city country and culture. This is one bad dude. Nelson who has done major time in the animation trenches including as head of story for ""Kung Fu Panda"" seems like an old pro despite ""P2"" being her first time in the directors chair. That she grew up as much a fan of martial arts as animation can be felt everywhere in elaborately choreographed fighting sequences A  la ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and in small touches -- the way in which Lord Shen turns his peacock feathers into lethal weapons especially powerful when combined with Oldmans ability to sound so deadly. How does he do it? There is much less of the comic book sketching-voice-over combo that was used liberally in the first ""Panda"" to fill in the blanks. And that is a good thing. For ""Panda 2"" is not just wall-to-wall animation it is artistry of the highest order. I dont know whether its the technology thats changed or that the artists most of whom worked on the first have grown but there is a striking new level of emotion in the characters themselves particularly their eyes that does much to well animate the film. That expressiveness combined with the talented voice cast brings a nuance a sense of reality that is hard to achieve in animation. You feel it especially in the quiet moments though there are not too many of those. Its as if the filmmakers fear they will lose the audience if they slow down and find that inner peace that Master Shifu is always preaching about and that Pos sweet silly goose of a dad Mr. Ping (James Hong) just comes by naturally even when Po figures out Ping may not be his birth pa. The look itself is a visual mash-up that evokes a nostalgia for both fairy tales and kung-fu fighting. Animation styles dip into genres as diverse as Grimm animA(c) and Saturday morning cartoons yet somehow it mostly works. The big action pieces particularly the final face-off are masterful both for their cleverness in bringing down the house and the detail jammed into every frame. Even composers Hans Zimmer whos scored a zillion movies and John Powell seem to be having more fun than usual. Now to the 3-D. What makes it appealing in ""Panda 2"" is how deeply embedded it is within the film. Its not just the random fireball being hurled right at us but that the entire world of Po feels as if it has been carved out of space rather than sketched out on a page. There is a price to be paid for the visual razzle-dazzle -- wonderful complexity against a simple story that could have benefited from some bulking up (layered not longer). Still with Black shelving his usual snark for Pos self-deprecating charm Jolie making Tigress terrifyingly overqualified for everything as only she can do Rogens Mantis showing the actors growing facility for voicing animation and Hoffman as ever the guru everyone wants theyve brought this warriors tale to kicking spinning bone-crunching feather-flying life. And the fireworks are awesome.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + How did I not see this coming?In the original ""Kung Fu Panda Po the chubby Chinese bear voiced by Jack Black was introduced as the heroically destined son of a humble goose named Mr. Ping (James Hong). Their unusual-looking relationship was never explained but in a cartoon filled with anthropomorphic animals skilled in death-defying martial arts that hardly seemed like the biggest plot hole.Now ""Kung Fu Panda 2 puts adoption and Pos search for his true identity at the center of a sequel that isnt shy about trading some of its ancestors light and fluffy parts for a whole thats considerably darker and heavier. The shift in tone is neither unprecedented nor inherently bad (see the exceptional ""Toy Story 3) but it is something you ought to know before bringing young children to a screening -- particularly young adopted children as I unwittingly did.In the hands of first-time director Jennifer Yuh Nelson this latest installment of the ""KFP franchise takes its cues from martial-arts classics. Yuh Nelson was promoted from the creative/design ranks of the 2008 DreamWorks original directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson so it comes as no surprise that the sequel amps up the beauty of its ancient China setting and delivers 3-D animation that enhances even if it doesnt exactly astound. For all its high-spirited action scenes the films most impressive sequence involves a single water droplet which is later echoed in an artfully choreographed battle involving cannonballs.Original writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger are back as is much of the cast including Angelina Jolie (Tigress) Seth Rogen (Mantis) Jackie Chan (Monkey) David Cross (Crane) and Lucy Liu (Viper) a.k.a. the Furious Five who support Blacks adventures as Po. Dustin Hoffman again plays the wise Master Shifu who pops up when needed to guide Pos spiritual journey and there are some inspired new additions to round things out Gary Oldman as Pos latest arch nemesis Michelle Yeoh as a soothsayer Jean-Claude Van Damme as a past-his-prime crocodile.Its still Blacks franchise though. And part of the problem with this sequel is how little it lets its star just riff with silly abandon as he did throughout the original rather than advance the serious themes set out by Yuh Nelson and her crew.Exit here if youd rather not read any spoilers. If this review does nothing else its going to warn parents that ""Kung Fu Panda 2 contains elements that definitely arent suitable for all ages and a few that shouldnt suit anyone.Heres the story As Po the ""Dragon Warrior goes up against a new/old brand of evil that seeks power over all his countrymen he flashes back to a childhood moment when his parents pursued by attackers intent on exterminating the entire panda population placed him in a vegetable basket that eventually found its way to Mr. Pings noodle shop. Discovering that he was adopted throws Po into an identity crisis that continues through most of the movie and repeatedly leads him to ask ""Who am I? and ""Where did I come from? -- powerful questions for little ears. As Po gradually learns the horrible details of his parents fate and who was responsible for it (no killings are shown but the ominous memory-flashes and images of pursuit are intensely scary) he must muster both courage and inner peace to defeat his evil opponent and grasp a classic martial-arts lesson You can rise above your past no matter how tragic if you embrace the present and become the person (or bear) you choose to be.Its a worthwhile message. And if ""KFP2 had ended it there I might agree with Jolies recent offscreen comments that this film simply provides talking points for all families including those conceived through adoption who want to explore them. But in a reprehensible stroke that seems calculated purely to set up the next installment of the franchise a final scene shows Pos biological father who apparently survived the killings uttering a premonition that his son is alive.Thats one heck of a talking point.

Wax on wax off.The yin and yang between word and image is especially clear in cartoons. In the 3-D era too many animated movies are dazzling yet dumb. But this well-executed sequel is sneaky. While it distracts us with Chinese backdrops and buffoonish humor it sucker punches us with a message about belonging.Since Po the Panda (voice of Jack Black) discovered kung fu and won the title of dragon warrior he has become a celebrity in his Chinese village. Kids carry his action figures and fans flock to the restaurant run by his proud father the goose (James Wong). But then the roly-poly panda learns that he was adopted. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) says the only way Po can attain inner peace is by traveling to his birthplace to confront Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) the vainglorious peacock that divided Pos birth family and now threatens all of China with a new weapon gunpowder. In the era of gunpowder kung fu itself may disappear.For the mountainous trek to Shens fortress Po regroups the martial-arts masters known as the Furious Five Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Crane (David Cross) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Mantis (Seth Rogen).Thats a terrific cast but the script gives them too little to do. The ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies revolve around Blacks riffs and they underscore the sweetness in his bluster better than his recent live-action films.Ironically Blacks double-take humor and punctured vanity seem inspired by the comedic kung-fu movies of Chan -- which aggravates the awareness that Monkey is missing in action. Director Jessica Yuh pours so much love into the landscapes and the look of the film that 3-D for a change is the best way to appreciate it. And the historic-background and heart-tugging flashback scenes beautifully emulate shadow puppets and pen-and-ink drawings respectively.

This entry aims to expand the series both in storytelling terms and visually. It introduces emotionally complex issues and literally adds new scope via 3-D. In each case the payoff is impressive. The movie opens with a ravishing replica of traditional Chinese shadow puppet plays. The prologue introduces the movies new villain a militarist peacock named Lord Shen who aims to conquer China by exterminating kung fu. Po a giant panda who transformed himself from a dumpling-shaped layabout to a mighty martial arts master leads his Furious Five posse against Lord Shens ""unstoppable"" new weapon. But pride may be his undoing unless he can find spiritual harmony as his mentor Master Shifu instructs. Haunted by memories of infancy and always a bit at odds with his fussbudget dad -- how can a goose sire a panda? -- Po lacks inner peace. He will have to subdue his own demons before he can vanquish his foe. The vocal cast is fine with Jack Black alternately laconic and lunatic as Po and Gary Oldman all silken menace as Lord Shen whose claws and tail feathers double as rapiers. Angelina Jolies strong protective Master Tigress moves to the forefront of Pos team as Pos surrogate Tiger Mother embodying the strict Chinese parenting that the immature hero still needs. Her colleagues Jackie Chan Seth Rogen David Cross and Lucy Liu get about two lines apiece. But thats fine because it gives more room to Michelle Yeoh as a soothsaying mountain goat who nervously nibbles at her clients robes when not dispensing wisdom and James Hong as Mr. Ping Pos proud papa. The films richly textured visuals will leave you breathless. The screen is almost radioactive with beauty. The backgrounds are photorealistic landscapes of National Geographic magnificence the interiors are fever dreams of Ming Dynasty splendor and the character animation with complex but extremely smooth kung fu choreography simply flows. Fireworks are a key element of the story and the sheer surfeit of visual delights -- more than the eye can absorb in any one moment -- mirrors the climax of a fireworks display. Theres dizzy slapstick wit to the fighting. In one scene Po and friends hide in a street-dance dragon that seemingly gobbles up Lord Shens wolf henchmen and expels them out the other end. A climactic naval battle puts ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" to shame as it whittles an armada of long ships into chopsticks. Magical as the slick 3-D scenes are the antique shadow play that opens the movie is even cooler. KUNG FU PANDA 2  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for sequences of martial arts action and mild violence. Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"") did a script polish no doubt adding the notes of soul-searching and doubt that peck at Po. That master of fairy-tale menace Guillermo del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"" ""Hellboy"") is credited as a creative consultant sharpening the talons of Lord Shen Id wager. And the gag writers are ever-inventive In one absurd exchange Po atop a towering roof shouts a challenge to Lord Shen who cant make out a word hes saying. Theres an intimidating number of moving parts in a project such as this and director Jennifer Yuh keeps it all running smoothly. The effort must have been considerable. The result is worth it.

(Sweet moves Tigress.) (2010 DreamWorks Animation LLC) B+ Kung Fu Panda 2 Genre Animation Action/Adventure; Starring Jack Black Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan; Author Jonathan Aibel Glenn Berger; Release Date Wide 05/26/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 91; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted June 6 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT When Po the clown-eyed roly-poly kick-ass panda bear hero of Kung Fu Panda 2 goes into his twirly lightning-limbed fighting mode he doesnt leave his slightly abashed suburban sweetness behind. ""Yes"" he says dispatching a foe ""Taste the defeat"" and you can hear the joyous disbelief (did I really just whip that guys butt?) in the gee-whiz sound of Jack Black who voices him. Its not hard to see why children love Po the rare animated hero whos awesome and ridiculous at the same moment. Hes like the coolest stuffed animal in the world. But since he became a triumphant member of the Furious Five -- Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Crane (David Cross) -- in 2008s Kung Fu Panda whats left for him to conquer beyond the next bowl of dumplings? In Kung Fu Panda 2 Po must now defeat a seething white peacock Lord Shen (voiced with silvery menace by Gary Oldman) who owns a gigantic cannon he plans to use to put the Furious Five -- and indeed all of kung fu -- out of business. More than that Po must come to grips with his own repressed memories of the moment that left him an abandoned infant. At times Kung Fu Panda 2 suggests Bambi redone as an episode of Oprah. Yet its a more-than-worthy sequel. Youll taste and savor the victory through an irresistible gush of ""healing"" tears.

Kung Fu Panda 2 Good Director Jennifer Yuh. Cast Voices of Jack Black Gary Oldman Angelina Jolie Dustin Hoffman. Rating PG for sequences of martial arts action and mild violence. This weeks new CD releases Spotlight Seth Rogen Spotlight Angelina Jolie Spotlight Jackie Chan Animated movies Martial arts movies Having pratfallen his way to victory over a ferocious snow leopard and claimed his destiny as the prophesied Dragon Warrior Po- the geeked-out black-and-white furball voiced by Jack Black - now must ""save kung fu"" from the evils of artillery and foil a genocidal peacocks plot to take over China but only after solving the mystery of his own origins and finding inner peace. And all that without getting in the way of the action set pieces and scatological sight gags. Jack Black talks Kung Fu Panda 2 To call DreamWorks computer-animated martial-arts franchise slick corporate entertainment is no insult. After all a Mercedes comes off an assembly line too and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is certainly a precisely calibrated crowd-pleasing machine balancing action comedy and just the bare minimum of pathos. The sequel introduces Lord Shen a delightfully vain villain (he is a peacock after all) voiced to sinister perfection by Gary Oldman. Exiled for slaughtering ancient Chinas panda population (making Po an orphan in the process) he returns as a conquering tyrant with a secret weapon gunpowder and cannons. Hot on his tail feathers are Po and the Furious Five - Tigress Monkey Viper Mantis and Crane the Super Friends of biodiversity. Filmed in vibrant CGI color and optional nicely restrained 3-D the movie is packed with hyperventilated fisticuffs (pawsicuffs?) and imaginative slapstick. The best bit (already spoilerized in the trailer) involves the heroes in ""stealth mode"" inside a giant dragon puppet that gobbles up bad guys like Homer Simpson at a donut factory then ""poops"" them out the back end. New characters include a pair of kung fu masters voiced by Dennis Haysbert and Jean-Claude Van Damme as well as a soothsaying mountain goat (Michelle Yeoh) who keeps chewing on Shens expensive robes. They join returning faves Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and Mr. Ping the humble goose lovingly played by Hollywood veteran James Hong. To tell the truth though the cast is far more star-studded than strictly necessary. Without her killer bod and Mick Jagger lips Angelina Jolie barely makes an impression as the voice of Tigress and you will be hard put to remember a single line spoken by her Furious friends despite the combined celebrity wattage of Lucy Liu Seth Rogen David Cross and Jackie Chan. But heck if DreamWorks wants to throw extra money at Hollywood royalty thats their prerogative. The price is the same at the box office - and well worth it for the amusement-park ride.

The complicated emotional ramifications of adoption are the prime focus of this follow-up which concerns Pos quest for identity and inner peace goals that are maturely posited as only attainable through confronting and then letting go of the past. Pos search for self takes the form of a showdown against Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) a genocidal peacock who murdered Pos birth parents and whos now determined to conquer China with the use of a fiery cannon. That modern weapon spells potential doom for the ancient art of kung fu and the saga that it spawns--marked by Blacks buoyant vocal performance--is amusing and exciting. With bouncy animation augmented by not-terrible 3-D and a rollicking spirit reminiscent of the films of Jackie Chan (who returns to voice Pos Furious Five comrade Monkey) Jennifer Yuh Nelsons sequel delivers a bevy of superpowered set pieces that are dexterous and delirious as well as tonally confident. As fists and feet fly wisecracking humor flows naturally from the combat lending this assured adventure a self-deprecating lightheartedness.

KO for the cuddly warrior. TWITTER Compelling villain and visual grace keep second second installment in what studio hopes will become six-picture franchise going strong. ""Kung Fu is dead"" Or so the rotund hero is told in this second installment of the Kung Fu Panda series from DreamWorks Animation which itself is not taking the threat seriously as the company is reportedly already mapping out plans for five entries in the franchise. Nor will the box office returns for the new film inhibit such long-range thinking as the enhancement of 3D as well as a deeper more involved storyline mark this as a slight improvement on the 2008 original which raked in some 633 million worldwide. Creating ever-more compelling villains always represents a challenge for ongoing film series from James Bond to Batman so the introduction of a slim peacock who not only claims that ""China will be mine"" but also intends to eliminate kung fu represents a real force to be reckoned with. At the same time returning screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger have nicely used the title characters search for his real father to provide a little depth and poignance to a character whose initial rambunctiousness was a bit grating but which has now been mellowed with a measure of self-reflection about his childhood. Not that the series has gone soft or serious. Not at all. Its just that unlike on some other DreamWorks Animation franchises its apparent that some extra effort has been expended to make sure that the second entry here didnt hit a foul ball to strengthen the bench to provide a little extra depth. Consolidating his position as Dragon Warrior and still supported by the Furious Five--Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross)--Po (Jack Black) initiates his search for his real dad (surely not the goose who raised him) while Lord Shen (Gary Oldman) embarks upon what he sees as his prophesized mission to take over all of  China with an ""unstoppable"" new weapon. To do this Shen must conquer ever-more territory in his quest for additional metal while Pos investigation triggers a flashback revealing that his abandonment by his real father had an unimagined link with present events leading to a pretty spectacular battle involving battleships cannons and Pos rediscovery of his ""inner peace"" in a pictorially imposing harbor. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson who worked on the first installment as head of story action sequences supervisor and the Dali-esque position of dream sequence director devotes the requisite amount of time to small-fry-friendly bumptious slapstick and silliness which feels generically mandatory. But it all moves along briskly with a degree of visual grace and a solid feel for 3D. The series regulars who also include Dustin Hoffman as an old guru and James Hong as Pos ostensible dad all return--and why not?--while Oldman balances Shens physical modesty with his expertise in vocal menace. Hans Zimmers score is an energetic plus but the films single most striking feature are the end credits which employ a beautifully designed flipping lantern technique accompanied by wittily ever-accelerating music.

Whats black and white and rad all over again? Chopsocky panda Po returns to save China from a fresh threat in ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" a worthy sequel to DreamWorks Animations biggest non-""Shrek"" hit that gets an extra kick from the addition of dynamic 3D fight sequences. Expanding the Jack Black characters mythology while ensuring his starry supporting cast -- aka ""the Furious Five"" -- has more to do this time around the gangbusters-bound second helping shrewdly extends the originals endearing gorgeously art-directed world shoring up the franchises foundation at the point other DWA follow-ups typically begin to wear out their welcome. Developed under the title ""The Kaboom of Doom"" this fast-tracked follow-up finds the honorable tradition of martial arts quite literally under fire from Lord Shen a regal albino peacock who has developed a gunpowder-powered cannon that renders hand-to-hand combat obsolete. Taking a page from King Herod Shen overreacts to a prophecy foretelling that a panda will be his downfall by endangering the species with a ruthless extermination campaign -- a harrowing backstory (for the little ones at least) involving a teddy-cute baby Po. As designed by Nico Marlet Shen is an elegant cold-blooded fighter unfolding his tail like a giant paper fan and flinging his feathers like daggers at will. Shens moves are sinister yet hypnotic an effect enhanced by Gary Oldmans menacing voicework and the glaring red-eye motif that marks a signature of the characters design. (Other new cast members include Masters Croc Oxen and Rhino played by Jean-Claude Van Damme Dennis Haysbert and Victor Garber respectively.) Rather than simply dashing off another adventure with a new villain the way most superhero sequels do screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (with consulting help from Charlie Kaufman and Guillermo del Toro) opt to enrich their heros personal history. In the interim since ""Kung Fu Panda"" Po has gotten over his underdog complex embracing his unconventional fighting style to keep the Valley of Peace safe. While Pos newfound confidence removes the central conflict from the original the character still poses his own greatest obstacle Before he can hope to vanquish Shen Po must find ""inner peace"" by coming to terms with the long-suppressed trauma of what happened to his birth parents. (You didnt think James Hongs hilarious noodle-cooking goose was his real dad did you?) Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson who oversaw the stunning opening scene from the first film employs other animation styles for sequences that take place in the past the most striking of which is Shens origin story rendered in the delicate paper-theater tradition. But even the principal 3D animation tips its hat to classic Chinese art and architecture as production designer Raymond Zibach brings a vivid watercolor palette to gorgeous landscapes. The effect is enhanced by multiple tracking shots as the camera follows the characters around the roofs and stairs of temples and other period buildings. With all the movement involved ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" lends itself to the stereoscopic format. An early action scene finds Po and the Furious Five (Angelina Jolie Seth Rogen Lucy Liu Jackie Chan and David Cross all return as animals who embody their respective fighting styles) teaming up to create exciting fighting combinations. The editing doesnt always make it possible to follow each individual move but the technique shows considerable improvement even though no sequence comes close to the originals rope-bridge fight for sheer narrative excitement. Of the supporting cast Tigress (Jolie) gets the most additional screen time including a few scenes with Po that suggest the screenwriters toyed with the idea of a romantic subplot between the two. Still theres simply not enough room to do proper justice to every character in the films sizable ensemble. Once again the DreamWorks team demonstrates that humor is the primary weapon in its arsenal relying on Black to crack wise throughout while doing their best to supply jokes that wont date the movie a decade down the road. Appealing as they do to adults and kids alike the laughs help to pave over certain shortcomings in the story -- namely the way it seems to be split down the middle with Po cornering Shen at his palace earlier than expected then working through the best way to fight him for the second half of the pic. In contrast with the grainy low-budget kung-fu pics that inspired the franchise ""Panda"" offers considerable high-end polish ranging from Hans Zimmer and John Powells bombastic score to the care taken in translating Pos world to 3D. While not as fresh as the first the sequel certainly makes good on its promise. Kung Fu Panda 2Animated ProductionA Paramount release of a DreamWorks Animation presentation. Produced by Melissa Cobb.
