By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor October 7 2005 Save for later Saved Good Night and Good Luck pays homage to CBS news legend Edward R. Murrow for going up against anticommunist crusader Sen. Joseph McCarthy chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations when few in the 50s-era media would dare. [Editors note The original version incorrectly identified the committee which Sen. McCarthy chaired.]As portrayed by David Strathairn Mr. Murrow is a chain-smoking tight-voiced champion who turns mythic before our eyes. His producer at CBS Fred Friendly played by an uncharacteristically clean-shaven George Clooney (who also co-wrote and directed) gapes at Murrow with a mixture of awe and gratitude. Murrow seems to confirm for Friendly and the other CBS staffers the reason why they got into journalism in the first place.Shot in lustrous black and white by Robert Elswit the film itself seems at times like a relic of the 50s. It has a Golden Age of Television patina. The action most of which takes place inside the CBS studio and offices has the hardbitten edge of TV problem dramas in the Paddy Chayefsky mold. People fume and bark and declaim as if their dialogue were spelled out in capital letters. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Clooneys seat-of-the-pants approach to dramaturgy doesnt leave much room for psychological depth. Murrow isnt really a character in this film; hes a beacon for others to follow. And clearly the filmmakers believe his example is worth following. Although Clooney doesnt overdo it we are obviously meant to draw parallels between the timidity of the press and the climate of fear then and now. In one scene Murrow justifies the decision to pursue his televised attack on Senator McCarthy by pointing out to the assembled staff that ""the terror is here in this room."" (So is a maelstrom of cigarette smoke. This is the smokingest movie since the heyday of Bette Davis.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a solid achievement but those in the press who have been trumpeting its greatness may be going in for a bit of self-congratulation. The movie plays very well to the choir. Murrow comes across as so saintly that even his stints interviewing the likes of Liberace for his celebrity-interview show are explained away as the price you pay to bring down the bad guys.Murrows broadsides against McCarthy were heroic and necessary. But the images I remember most from ""Good Night and Good Luck"" are not the hero-worshippy tableaux but rather the closeups of CBS newsman Don Hollenbeck heartbreakingly played by Ray Wise when he hears himself being personally targeted by McCarthys venom. His stricken features are the emblem of all those who were annihilated by the witchhunt. Grade B+ Rated PG for mild thematic elements and brief language.

"Murrows compelling civics - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Murrow Murrows compelling civicsmovies - review`Good night and Good Luck illuminates the chilling red-baiting of the 1950sOctober 21 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticForty years after his death and 50 years removed from his finest hour Edward R. Murrow keeps giving us civics lessons.The CBS newsman was famed for his integrity his courage and for taking on red-baiting Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the height of the communist witch hunt of the 1950s. He comes back to life in David Strathairns bowstring-tight performance in George Clooneys elegiac black-and-white film Good Night and Good Luck.Its about the tenor of those times the buttoned-down 1950s when it was better to be dead than red. The Cold War was chilling by the minute and fear of the Soviets drove Americans to look for communists in our midst. Conservative zealots stoked that climate of fear and used it to set up inquisitions to ferret out alleged communists from the government.Riding to fame on this was ""the junior senator from Wisconsin"" Joseph McCarthy. He ruined lives by bending and making up facts. He hurled accusations and cowed his critics with the threat that they would be the next to feel his bludgeon.Murrow the poker-faced chain-smoking inventor of broadcast journalism his clipped diction curling around precise poetic phrases watched the hysteria sweeping the country studied McCarthy found his opening and turned the tables on the senator in a series of broadcasts for his CBS show See It Now. He didnt as the film points out actually bring the man down. He merely gave the country the spine to stand up to McCarthy.Clooneys film -- he co-wrote the script directed and co-stars as Murrows producer Fred Friendly -- brilliantly re-creates the era when the issues and the culture seemed as starkly divided as the black-and-white television pictures of the era. It was a different age when white men in white shirts and ties decided everything there was to decide in America when broadcast journalists developed their own catch phrases (""Good night and good luck"" was Murrows).It was a time when a celebrated war-hardened reporter could hope that integrity and reputation would trump accusations of ""bias"" and a day when conservatives used their favorite shoot-the-messenger phrase ""liberal media"" in its fuller earlier and more naked form ""Jewish liberal media.""In that climate of fear and bigotry Murrow whom Strathairn plays with the same inscrutable public face and rounded locutions that the man always presented risked his reputation his network and his boss William Paley (a forceful Frank Langella) in an effort to show the country that the senator-who-would-be-emperor had no clothes.Clooney raises excitement and suspense with sweeping tracking shots following the news team through its rabbit warren of offices as newsmen prepare their ""shots"" in this ""shooting war"" with McCarthy. But his tensest and most dramatic moments are simple arguments between Murrow and Paley or chilly encounters on the CBS elevator between Paley -- the voice of profit -- and Friendly the crusading journalist.The consequences of this fight are played out among a strong supporting cast -- the reporters (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) with something to hide the fragile TV anchor caught in conservative columnists crossfire (Ray Wise).For McCarthys performance Clooney uses the actual telecast footage with the real committee hearings with the real McCarthy haranguing witnesses and the real TV footage of McCarthy taking to the airwaves to defend himself and attack Murrow to show us the best reality TV of the 1950s. Hes still TVs best villain.Its worth noting how showing McCarthy like this humanizes him and takes some of the label of ""monster"" off the man. He wasnt as polished as Murrow but he was quite the performer a fact as obvious as the reasons liberal Clooney chose to tell this story this way and at this point in our nations history. If the real McCarthy looks and sounds very much like a fellow named Limbaugh thats no accident.But this review has beaten around a very obvious bush too long and Murrow formal phrasing or no wouldnt stand for that.The bottom line on Good Night and Good Luck? See it. Now.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain.

Murrow took on Sen. Joseph McCarthy Joseph Persico writes in his biography ""Edward R. Murrow An American Original"" ""The man the viewers saw on the screen looked like a casting directors idea of exactly what he had been a famous war correspondent strikingly handsome but without the pretty-boy Hollywood perfection."" That serves as a spot-on description of actor George Clooney the director of ""Good Night and Good Luck."" But Persicos description is not too far off in nailing the appeal of actor David Strathairn who embodies Murrow in Clooneys masterfully measured moving and wounding film about the historic brawl between two men of extraordinary power who represented two different visions of the American ideal. One man stood for liberty integrity and compassion. The other would be revealed as starkly lacking in those qualities. McCarthy learned during his re-election campaign that exploiting fear in anxious days of the Cold War was an incredibly effective power tool. In 1950 he asserted in a speech at a Republican womens club in Wheeling W.V. that there were 205 ""known communists"" (a fabrication) in the State Department. From then until the mid-50s McCarthy stoked what appeared to be a flickering political career by accusing people in high places - or modest it didnt matter - of being communists subversives traitors. Shot in sumptuous black-and- white there is little black and white about the ideas - or emotions - expressed in this handsome work written by Clooney and Grant Heslov. Yet as stylish as ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is its nostalgic luster is a ruse. This films contemporary resonance is deafening - and maybe just a bit heartbreaking. As Murrow and his staff head for their showdown with McCarthy longtime Murrow reporter Joe Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.) says to wife Shirley (Patricia Clarkson) ""What if were wrong?"" Its moment of astounding vulnerability and doubt. As for Murrow he held his ground with a cigarette burning in his hand and without the bluster of his foe or the patina of certainty so common today. Born in Polecat Creek N.C. Murrow became famous for his radio broadcasts from England during World War II. When he arrived at CBS he and producer Fred Friendly turned the successful ""Hear It Now"" into televisions first newsmagazine show ""See It Now."" On the night of March 9 1954 Murrow offered the nation a ""See It Now"" segment about the methods employed by the junior senator from Wisconsin. Clooney and his cast make what could be static gripping. Few people had taken on McCarthy and while Murrow was not the first to question the senator challenging him had never seemed effective. Once the senator made a splash with his accusations in the press the rebuttals never seemed as juicy or newsworthy. When someone parried with the facts McCarthy feinted with an accusation of treason. One of the inventive choices Clooney makes here was to cast McCarthy as McCarthy. Like Murrow did in his telecast Clooney uses footage of the senator at hearings to make his point. If there was a match that lit Murrows fuse it came when the Air Force discharged Lt. Milo Radulovich for being a ""security risk."" When Murrow begins to pursue a report on Radulovich hes told ""this isnt McCarthy."" ""Isnt it?"" he replies. Frank Langella plays William Paley longtime chairman of CBS. His is nearly as vital a role as Strathairns. After all Paley represents the bedeviling reality of televisions will to entertain inform and make many an advertising buck doing it. On the night of the McCarthy broadcast Paley calls Murrow. What he says may make tears well up. But youll have to dry them when you recall that the film opens with Murrow chastising his broadcast colleagues at a fete given him during the 1958 Radio and Television Directors Association gathering. Clearly Clooney who plays Friendly loves television - or at least its complex history. His directorial debut ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" was an engaging uneven plunge into the manic genius of Chuck Barris the game-show creator who claimed in his memoir to be a CIA hitman. ""Confessions"" was essentially a lark. In ""Good Night and Good Luck"" Clooney makes an elegant argument that something of vital interest is still at stake in this story. It would take a stubborn soul to disagree.

There were fundamental civil rights riding on Edward R. Murrows public fight with Joseph McCarthy and that alone seems to beg for a grand moral drama. Good Night and Good Luck is another animal altogether a small ensemble piece that plays like a night out in a ritzy Manhattan supper club. Hang in though and there are riches in the works a wicked character study of Murrow whos played by David Strathairn in Brylcreem and exquisitely tailored pinstripes; and a sexy homage to the pleasures of working alongside a team of smart-ass reporters making common cause. Shot in sleek black-and-white and laced with silky riffs from singer Dianne Reeves Good Night and Good Luck opens as it closes at the To read Scott Foundas interview with George Clooney click here. To read Scott Foundas interview with David Strathairn click here. 1958 convention of the Radio and Television News Directors Association with Murrow delivering a keynote speech in which he unexpectedly tears into not the anti-communist witch-hunts over which he has obsessed for five years on his muckraking television news show See It Now but rather the threats of corporate sponsorship to freedom of speech. Then the action backs up to 1953 with Murrow and his producer Fred Friendly (an amusingly porked-out Clooney in thick black glasses) mulling an episode of See It Now Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm devoted to investigating McCarthys possible behind-the-scenes involvement in the expulsion of an Army Air Corps reservist on the grounds that his Yugoslavian father and sister subscribed to communist newspapers. It seems perverse to trap the ensuing dirty struggle between Murrow and McCarthy -- who tried to paint Murrow as a socialist and a commie sympathizer though he was neither -- in the politely aestheticized bubble of a cramped CBS newsroom often with the sound turned off at moments of high drama. Yet somehow the gambit works thanks to a glamorously urbane ensemble featuring Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson as Joe and Shirley Wershba who had to keep their marriage secret because it violated the networks house rules; a superbly wry Frank Langella as CBS president William Paley; Jeff Daniels as Paleys bloodless number two Sig Mickelson; and Ray Wise as the terminally stressed anchorman Don Hollenbeck. Theres a lovely improvised lilt to their interactions (the briskly funny screenplay is by Clooney and Grant Heslov who also produced) a controlled frenzy that takes you back to the days when people actually had fun at work even in a large corporation. As for Strathairn he has his work cut out playing opposite footage of the real McCarthy. (Clooneys use of archival footage here seems a fussy and pointless stylistic tic. I can think of several actorly bully boys -- Michael Madsen say or Billy Bob Thornton or even Tom Sizemore -- who would have done the junior senator from Wisconsin proud.) But this most inward of actors bears up beautifully as the famously laconic Murrow unsmiling and austere like the son of Quaker abolitionists that he was. Gazing snootily down his long parsons nose his severe mouth the only muscle moving in that long face Strathairn works up a Bogartian white heat and watching him you want to thank all known deities that Murrow was in the right camp. Consciously or not Good Night and Good Luck deftly implies that for all the differences between Murrow and McCarthy they had in common the same unbending nature and willingness to burn all bridges their careers included in the service of their beliefs. Like McCarthy Murrow is an absolutist and it takes Paley -- a political animal to his core though hardly without scruples -- to remind the journalist that everyone even Edward R. Murrow censors himself. The comparison can only be pushed so far. Murrow had irony decency and an incisive intellect on his side and for all the lip service he had to pay CBS by interviewing celebrities (theres a very funny exchange between a lethargic eye-rolling Murrow and a chipper Liberace) he refused to bend any more to the dictates of big business than to McCarthys threats. Clooney has said that he made Good Night and Good Luck partly to educate the young and its clear he means to draw comparisons between the climate of fear created by McCarthy and HUAC and the Bush administrations messing with civil rights. Im not convinced -- like many movies reaching for lessons from history Good Night and Good Luck tends to conflate past apples with present oranges. But theres no doubt that the movie gives Murrow his due as one of broadcast journalisms last great figures. He was also one of its last colorful characters -- heroic self-destructive somewhat tragic -- and not even Peter Jennings who like his hero smoked his way to an early grave came close. Of the scintillating media types with whom Murrow surrounded himself only Don Hewitt (played in the movie by Heslov) survived over the long haul as the producer of 60 Minutes that wan stepchild of See It Now. Murrow was a man of his time and if you think times havent changed much try imagining what would happen if he were to show up today at a White House press conference with his usual armory of awkward questions. Hed be spun which Im sure this great gent would regard as a fate worse than being smeared.GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK | Directed by GEORGE CLOONEY | Written by CLOONEY and GRANT HESLOV | Produced by HESLOV | Released by Warner Independent Pictures | At selected theaters Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Good Night and Good Luck | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; good-night-and-good-luck ) Good Night and Good Luck (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it."" - George Santayana Its astounding that a treatment of a factual incident from five decades ago could have such powerful resonance today. Lessons learned it seems are not taken to heart or the next generation willfully ignores the hard truths purchased through blood sweat and tears by their parents. Todays climate of escalating paranoia isnt that different from what this country endured in the 1950s when the birth pains of the Cold War evacuated a placenta named Joseph McCarthy. And while the 2000s have not yet generated a demagogue of McCarthys stature the sense of dA(c)jA  vu is inescapable. Replace the ""Communism"" of the 50s with ""Terrorism"" today and the parallels come into focus. (Note this should not be interpreted as an argument that terrorism is not a serious threat but an indication that there are those who exploit it as a means of financial and political gain.) Good Night and Good Luck a dramatized account of the public struggle between revered CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and Sen. Joseph McCarthy unfolds against the tapestry of the turbulent 1950s. With bookend scenes taking place at an October 1958 ""Salute to Edward R. Murrow"" the bulk of the narrative transpires between October 1953 and April 1954. During those months Murrow devoted a number of episodes of his TV show See It Now to discrediting McCarthys persecution of men believed by the Senator to be un-American. After McCarthy targeted Murrow and the newsman was able to disprove the most damning allegations the Senate elected to investigate McCarthy and the witch-hunts were over. (The title Good Night and Good Luck echoes Murrows sign-off.) Most historically based motion pictures stray from the facts in order to cook up the level of drama but the struggle between Murrow and McCarthy is so intense that there is no need for director/co-writer George Clooney to deviate from the record. Events in the movie unfold as they did in real life. In fact instead of hiring an actor to play McCarthy Clooney relies on newsreel footage of the Senator. This adds to the productions sense of verisimilitude and the decisions to shoot in black-and-white and not use an instrumental score (some music is provided by jazz singer Dianne Reeves) give Good Night and Good Luck a strong documentary feel. This is not a movie of grand melodrama but of quiet understated moments. Its power is in the absence of manipulation. In addition to chronicling the Murrow/McCarthy struggle Clooneys movie makes a statement about the ""dumbing down"" of the mainstream news media. The responsibility of CBS to hard news was being warped by the need to entertain. At one point Murrow states ""We have a built in allergy to unpleasant information and our media reflects that."" He might as well be speaking about today as the 1950s. TV news is no longer about providing information but about giving compelling sound bytes that grab the attention but are immediately forgotten. Murrow was a visionary not only in the way he stood up for what he believed in but in how he saw the future unfolding. Of all the newsmen to work at the three major American networks over the years none (not even Walter Cronkite) has commanded the respect accorded to Murrow. Like David he ""threw stones at giants"" and survived. In re-creating Murrow actor David Strathairn made a careful study of his subject and has reproduced Murrows style down to the smallest gesture. Yet Strathairns work goes beyond imitation and impersonation; he creates an intensely passionate individual who is driven by an inflexible code of ethics. Like other actors who successfully create a cinematic doppelganger of a real person Strathairn gets under the characters skin. The supporting cast was selected not with star power in mind but with an eye toward actors who could do the best job fielding these roles. Clooney is a ""big name"" but by playing Murrows second fiddle Fred Friendly he takes a back seat. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson are the husband-and-wife team of Joe and Shirley Wershba who work together in a newsroom where colleagues are not supposed to be married. Frank Langella is William Paley the founder and chair of CBS. And Ray Wise possibly best known as Laura Palmers father/killer in TVs Twin Peaks plays the tragic figure of Don Hollenbeck. If there are movies that appeal primarily to the intellect and others that tug at the heartstrings Good Night and Good Luck resides in the former category. In the way it looks back at events with an unblinking eye the film offers a glimpse of times gone by. Let us hope it is not also peering into the future. This is a fascinating and compelling piece of filmmaking and its impact is enhanced by the style in which it is presented. Part docu-drama part thriller and part cautionary tale the movie offers something to everyone who craves more than escapism from the cinema. By releasing Good Night and Good Luck at this time Clooney is using history to remind us of the precipice upon which we now stand. It is for that reason that I have opened and will close this review with Santayanas oft-quoted line Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it.

"Good Night A Gray Era In Stark Black And White washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Good Night A Gray Era In Stark Black And White Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 7 2005 In December 1948 the renowned broadcaster Edward R. Murrow went on the air to denounce the Red-hunters of the U.S. government who had hounded his friend and mentor Laurence Duggan a former State Department employee to suicide. One can almost imagine the drama The distinguished newsman once the voice of blitzed London hair slicked back a nub of cigarette in his hand radiating vapors face as rigid as an Old Testament elder using that deep voice and crooning rhetoric to lambaste the puny minds of the House Un-American Activities Committee that had so besmirched Larrys good name that the man had leapt in despair from a 16th-floor window. But you wont find it in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" George Clooneys mounting of the dramatic confrontation between the estimable Murrow and the abrasive junior senator from Wisconsin Joseph McCarthy. One can readily see why. Duggan as it turned out was a Soviet spy code-named ""19"" then ""Frank"" and finally ""Prince."" He was moreover one of many Soviet spies embedded in the U.S. government at the time. Thats not all Clooney leaves out in his account of the Murrow-McCarthy fight He leaves out the Cold War the hot war in Korea the Venona decrypts that proved how sophisticated and exhaustive the Russian intelligence initiative against the American target was. He even leaves out McCarthy himself relying on archival footage and sparing himself the ordeal of trying to imagine such a fellow as a human being. He also leaves out nuance context empathy anything that suggests the larger truth that nothing is as simple as it seems. The film therefore is like a childs view of these events untroubled by complexity hungry for myth and simplicity. Fundamentally he refuses to acknowledge that as Joseph Persico wrote in his New York Times review of the 1999 book that brought these realities out Allen Weinstein and Alexander Vassilievs ""The Haunted Wood"" ""the hardest part of these revelations to accept at least for those of us who deplored the over zealous Red-hunting of the late 40s and early 50s is that the hunt rested on more substance than we cared to admit the phony posturing of Senator Joseph McCarthy aside."" The result does a disservice to history It suggests that McCarthy was an arbitrary sociopath disconnected from a larger issue. That he was just a bad Republican who liked to bully and destroy people out of his own pathology and he was smitten by the powerful moral force of a flawless crusader. Good whupped bad. Good hit bad upside the head. Good kicked butt. But nothing in real life is ever that simple and to pretend that it is has to be a lie itself. Thats the truth that should be spoken to the power that Clooney represents. Thus the movie fails to apprehend the true enormity of McCarthys crime. Not that he hounded a few lefties out of government or made a stink about the odd Red dentist who got a promotion at Fort Dix but that he forever tarnished by association the reputations of the security services charged with keeping us safe from the actual -- yes Virginia there was such a thing -- Red menace. That probably did more to help the Soviet espionage initiative than any State Department docum ent that was ever filched for them. Still its simplistic premise aside the movie is shrewdly made. As a director Clooney (who wrote the script with actor Grant Heslov) seems to channel the techniques of live television drama of that era. Hes like some Lumet or Frankenheimer wannabe who loves the big close-ups and stark lighting of televisions golden age. The black-and-white cinematography by Robert Elswit captures the particular hard-edged electricity of those days. For some reason the eye decodes black-and-white as more ""realistic"" than color and the scheme here is especially beneficial to the overall verisimilitude. And the movies built around one extravagant performance David Straithairns. Clooney himself with a few added pounds so that everyone could tell him how ""committed"" he was plays Fred W. Friendly Murrows producer; he barely registers. A bunch of young actors -- Reed Diamond Tate Donovan Heslov Robert Downey Jr. -- play reporters on the ""See It Now"" staff and CBS suits all to little effect. A subplot in which Downeys character Joe Wershba and a character played by Patricia Clarkson try to keep their marriage hidden from CBS which banned such unions comes to very little. Really only Strathairn as Murrow registers. Is this a performance or an impersonation? Thats hard to call because so in awe of Murrow is Clooney that he stays far outside. Murrow -- he must have had a sense of humor somewhere huh? -- seems more like John Brown than anyone else a moral reformer who is never less than 100 percent buttoned down. He looks like the kind of guy who never goes to the bathroom. Theres something actually rather dislikable and creepy about someone who takes himself this seriously and Clooney never lets us see another Ed Murrow. Did the guy drink joke pinch bottoms get angry root for a ball team love his kids read the funnies? You wont find out here. Now and then Clooney does add a small recognizable moment in all the drama. We see the reluctant Murrow interviewing Liberace on his other network show the showbiz-themed ""Person to Person"" and he asks him if theres a Mrs. Liberace in the near future. Oh no replies the sequined pianist I havent met the right gal yet. Strathairn off the television camera gives a little pained look as if he realizes that while he crusades for the truth on ""See It Now"" here on ""Person to Person"" hes just another liar and fraud playing a hoax on the public. The movie might have been much more interesting if Clooney had made ""Good Night and Good Luck"" -- the title is Murrows famous sign-off which probably isnt so famous anymore -- more like ""Person to Person"" and less like ""See It N ow."" Good Night and Good Luck (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for brief profanity.

Murrow walks tall staring down Sen. Joe McCarthy in Good Night and Good Luck which remains our good fortune. The only things missing from making this showdown worthy of a Western is Murrows sheriffs badge a dusty street and maybe a spittoon for McCarthys infamous invectives. David Strathairn stars as the legendary CBS News journalist Edward R. Murrow who faced down Sen. Joe McCarthy on TV in 1954. Warner Independent Flip you say? Well this viable awards contender isnt. So even-keeled that it allows McCarthy to play himself using kinescopes from the era Luck gleans extra depth from being the best movie ever about the in-bred tension between newsfolk and their advertisers. As such George Clooneys second directorial outing couldnt be more topical though the events it chronicles occurred over half a century ago. Newscasting deity Murrow who placated the front office by conducting fluffy celebrity interviews on Friday nights Person to Person took a corporately brave and controversial stand against the Republican Red-baiter from Wisconsin. The forum was CBS hard-news show and Murrows baby See It Now. About the movie Good Night and Good Luck     (out of four) Stars David Strathairn George Clooney Frank Langella Jeff Daniels Robert Downey Jr. Patricia Clarkson Ray Wise Director George Clooney Distributor Warner Independent Rating PG for mild thematic elements and brief language Running time 1 hour 33 minutes Opens Friday in select cities David Strathairn plays Murrow a performance eerily on the money and tinged with irony until now the actors standout role was playing future Red Scare casualty J. Robert Oppenheimer in the splendid Los Alamos TV movie Day One. Strathairns Murrow is an internally churning ""wired tight"" portrayal down to his famed chain-smoking on and off the air. At a time when even President Eisenhower never stood up to McCarthys reckless smears Murrow finally took off the gloves and exposed the senators tactics after Milo Radulovich was dismissed from the Army Air Corps following shaky accusations of communist sympathies. The show aired in March 1954 and when McCarthy badly flubbed a televised rebuttal it was the beginning of the end. Shot in black and white and narrowly focused this 93-minute crash course gives actor Clooney a chance to play off his own sterling direction with a frill-less portrayal (glasses pallor some extra heft) of Murrow producer Fred Friendly. And though Frank Langella isnt an obvious choice to play CBS president and chairman William Paley his penetrating eyes make him intimidating and authoritative especially in the movies best scene when Paley promises no censorship but makes it clear that ruffling sponsors will come with a substantial price. The extensive footage of McCarthy is artfully integrated. His flop-sweat and gauchely overbearing demeanor are almost guaranteed to scare the few little children who wander into this movie. For older audiences hell hang himself just as he did in 1954 -- not just on CBS but also on the televised Army-McCarthy hearings that crushed him.

Starring David Strathairn George Clooney and Patricia Clarkson. Directed by George Clooney. (PG. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Good Night and Good Luck"" dramatizes a key moment in the history of television news the standoff between newsman Edward R . Murrow and red-baiting Sen. Joseph McCarthy . In the course of three broadcasts in 1954 one of which McCarthy had all to himself Murrow went up against one of the most powerful and feared men in the country and by assembling facts and using the senators own statements against him more or less took him down. Those three episodes of ""See It Now"" marked the beginning of the end of McCarthys influence in America. Yet in the midst of what is widely considered an exalted period in TV news history undermining changes were taking place on the network level. The movie dramatizes that too -- the beginnings of news as a money-making enterprise as a ratings grabber as a form of entertainment. Part drama and part civics lesson ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is an entertaining slice of American political and cultural history enhanced by faithful period detail and energized by urgent parallels that George Clooney as director and co-writer wants to stress about the present day. The film is ambitious in intent not in scope. The scenes take place almost entirely in either the TV studio the CBS offices or the forlorn jazz club where the news staff unwinds. Murrow is at the center of the action -- played by David Strathairn who looks and sounds just like Murrow -- but the movie isnt his life story; nor is it a character study. Theres nothing about Murrows personal life. In fact ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is not really about people at all. Its about the news. Viewers interested in news history or politics will find much to enjoy while others hoping for a movie about personalities may come away feeling that something is missing. One thing is certain and thats that Clooney made the film he wanted to make. Shot in a high-contrast black and white it opens at a banquet in 1958 at which Murrow is about to be honored. As the camera floats in and out of the crowd take a moment to look at the faces The actors are wearing 1950s clothing and hairstyles and yet something in the actors essences retain the telltale suggestion of 2005. The changes in consciousness from one era to another are subtle yet unmistakable. At this 1958 banquet Murrow is supposed to take his award and say something nice but instead he uses the platform to criticize TV news for becoming a form of empty escapism. As with all of Murrows public pronouncements in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" the text is taken from Murrows own words and those words apply even more to today than yesterday. From there we go back another five years to the era of McCarthyism character assassination and loyalty oaths. Murrow is cautioned to be balanced in his coverage to which he replies ""I cant accept the idea that every issue has two equally reasonable sides to it."" Its an important point When one side is lying and the other is telling the truth it does the truth a disservice to present both positions as equally valid. Clooney lovingly re-creates the world of 50s television The jolly cigarette commercials the ancient technology (film instead of videotape) and the primitive ways of doing things. For example during the broadcasts producer Fred Friendly (Clooney) sits under Murrows desk and taps his leg when the camera is on. The rickety nature of the medium makes Murrow and company seem all the more vulnerable as they take on McCarthy. In an inspired touch McCarthy isnt played by an actor but by McCarthy himself through archival footage. Time doesnt allow for more than snippets though the actual ""See It Now"" episodes that the film dramatizes are available on DVD as part of ""The Edward R. Murrow Collection"" and are worth seeing. They show that if anything McCarthy was more sly formidable and persuasive than the film reveals. Murrow still wins ultimately but when McCarthy raises the specter of a terrible conspiracy and posits himself as the only possible savior one can see how people might believe him. Clooneys point will not please everybody. Clooney is suggesting that the fear McCarthy was trading in the fear people have of getting blown up is pervasive today; that the spirit of McCarthy an authoritarianism disguised in patriotic language lives on; and that TV news is no longer a match for it. At a time when movies are straining to be innocuous ""Goodnight and Good Luck"" is a bold entry to say the least. About half the public will also see it as patriotic. -- Advisory This film contains adult subject matter and a mild bedroom scene.

Murrow in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" FACT BOXGood Night and Good Luck Starring David Strathairn George Clooney Patricia Clarkson Robert Downey Jr. Jeff Daniels Frank Langella Directed by George Clooney Written by George Clooney and Grant Heslov Studio Warner Independent Pictures YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- George Clooney has the greatest commodity anyone can have in Hollywood -- clout -- and hes not afraid to use it.This time Clooney has used that leverage to make ""Good Night and Good Luck."" Its a small-budgeted movie (8 million peanuts in todays Hollywood) with a big topic the historic battle between the legendary CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow and Senator Joseph McCarthy. In 1954 Murrow devoted an episode of his show ""See It Now"" to McCarthy and in doing so helped hasten his downfall.But underneath is an even bigger topic the difficulties of reconciling the goals of the news media -- with its mission to ""comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable"" -- with the profit motive of a successful business.The movie handles its subjects with intelligence and energy and assumes the same alertness of its audience. No time is used to explain who these two men -- pioneering journalist Murrow communist-hunting red-baiting senator McCarthy -- were; the movie jumps right in to its 1950s setting and doesnt let up for its brisk 93-minute running time.Clooney who also directed and co-wrote (with Grant Heslov who plays producer Don Hewitt) plays Murrows producer Fred Friendly and does a fine job. Indeed the entire film is wonderfully cast and performed. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson as show writers and producers Joe and Shirley Wershba Jeff Daniels as producer Sig Mickelson and Frank Langella as CBS chief William Paley -- just to name a few -- all give strong believable performances.But the star of the show is David Strathairn who plays Murrow. Clutching an ever-present cigarette squinting into the camera lens seemingly bearing the weight of the world on his shoulders Stratharirn gives the performance of his life. An Oscar nomination is almost certain.Clooney wisely chose not to cast an actor for the role of McCarthy allowing the audience to see actual footage and hear the actual words spoken by the junior senator from Wisconsin as he created a climate of fear. McCarthys voice and facial expressions still pack a punch; even with the black-and-white photography and stark 50s setting the film feels as timely as the nightly news.Sleek and straightforwardThis is Clooneys second outing as a director; his first was the overly hyper ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."" With this film hes left behind all the bells and whistles. ""Good Night and Good Luck"" is sleek and straightforward adding to its drama -- even though as history we already know what happens.And Murrows words still hold powerful and basic truths for all Americans both conservative and liberal. Indeed the film is framed by a speech Murrow gave in 1958 to a news directors group.In the speech Murrow pointed out that television has the power to enlighten empower and teach but ""It can do so only to the extent that humans are allowed to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box.""Movies also have the power to enlighten empower and teach -- and offer whiz-bang roller coaster rides. Theres nothing wrong with the latter but its nice when a film comes along that does the former and is incredibly entertaining to boot. ""Good Night and Good Luck"" will probably need a little bit of luck (and good word-of-mouth) to succeed but seek it out Its a terrific film.""Good Night and Good Luck"" is a production of Warner Independent Pictures -- like CNN a unit of Time Warner.

"Good Night delivers realism and relevance - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Good Night delivers realism and relevance By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 7 2005 Good Night and Good Luck"" is a puzzle a hermetically sealed period piece so intensely relevant to our current state of affairs that it takes your breath away.Directed and co-written by George Clooney it also removes any doubt that the former Dr. Doug Ross of TVs ER"" is a filmmaker of uncommon thoughtfulness and skill. Formal problems aside Good Night"" is a call to civic responsibility and renewed purpose in broadcast journalism that demands to be seen and discussed by audiences of all ages and political stripes. Its that important.That maddening too. The story of TV newsman Edward R. Murrows 1954 decision to take on Senator Joe McCarthy and his anti-Communist witch hunt on the air and using just the facts has been turned into a small hard diamond of black-and-white polemic. Clooney and his co-writer Grant Heslov (who appears in a small role) hunker down with Murrows crew in CBSs Manhattan headquarters and rarely leave the building. The camera hovers and ducks in close past the omnipresent cigarette smoke of Murrow (David Strathairn) and into the inner sanctum of avid young men -- and they are pointedly almost all men -- creating the infant medium of TV news on the spot.What we see of the outside world is what they saw footage. There is no actor playing McCarthy and when Murrow invites the senator in for an on-air rebuttal its the real Joe McCarthy we see delivering his actual televised response. At one point Clooney cedes directorial control to a long undigested chunk of congressional testimony from Annie Lee Moss an elderly African-American woman who worked in the Pentagon basement and was accused by the senator of being a communist. She has never heard of this Karl Marx fellow but McCarthy and his wing man Roy Cohn press absurdly on.Murrow played this footage on air too but was careful to state that neither he nor CBS had evidence of Mosss actual political beliefs (which in fact turned out to be more complex than she admitted). Clooney uses it as a straight-up bid for audience sympathy and its one of the rare missteps in Good Night and Good Luck."" Another is the inclusion of what appears to be a CBS in-house jazz combo anchored by singer Dianne Reeves that provides the smoky late-night musical score. A touch of whimsy it cuts against the grain of rigorous realism the movie works so hard to establish elsewhere.Much more often this is a film of fierce and uncompromising ideas given human dimension by a terrific cast all of whom play it smart taut tight. Clooney and Heslovs script errs on the side of sanctification -- McCarthys public slide had begun well before CBS took the plunge -- but in the playing Strathairns Murrow is a man of unemotional gravitas who simply has had enough. When the legendary newsman decides to use his flagship program See It Now"" to make a case for Air Force Lieutenant Milo Radulovich after the latter is frog-marched out of the armed forces because his immigrant father reads a Serbian newspaper its a dangerous event. Alcoa wants to pull its ads; the godlike CBS chairman William Paley (Frank Langella) sweats cold bullets. Ive searched my conscience"" Murrow tells Paley and I cannot accept that there are two equivalent sides to every story."" The Army reinstated Radulovich a month after the broadcast. Clooney casts himself as Fred Friendly See It Now"" producer and easygoing good cop to Murrows Sergeant Joe Friday; the performance needs to be ingratiating and intelligent and its both of those things. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson provide further warmth as Joe and Shirley Wershba -- secretly wed despite the networks ban on married couples -- while Jeff Daniels plays producer Sid Mickelson as a man waiting with hope and dread to see what Murrow will do next. As newsman Don Hollenbeck who committed suicide in 1954 under pressure from McCarthyite forces in the press Ray Wise trembles rather too heavily with oncoming martyrdom.But this is a beautifully professional movie about professionals coming to appreciate the full measure of their duty as journalists and as Americans. Early in Good Night and Good Luck"" -- the title comes from Murrows on-air sign-off -- a loyalty oath floats around the CBS offices but the newsman doesnt blink. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty"" he tells the viewing public. We cannot defend freedom abroad while deserting it at home.""Ouch. As if this werent a sharp enough jab in the side of 21st century broadcast journalism addicted to ratings and terrified to take a stand (except for Fox News which is all stand all the time) Clooney opens and closes Good Night"" with bits of the 1958 industry dinner speech in which Murrow correctly foresaw and mourned the future of his medium.We are currently wealthy fat comfortable and complacent"" he tells his uneasy audience of movers and shakers. We have currently a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information. Our mass media reflect this. But unless we get up off our fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main is being used to distract delude amuse and insulate us then television and those who finance it those who look at it and those who work at it may see a totally different picture too late.""Hell of a speech and the full text is online if you care to look it up. Its tacked awkwardly on to the rest of the movie but you dont mind because the faults of Good Night and Good Luck"" are faults of commitment. Clooney understands you can sometimes see more inside the TV fishbowl looking out than the other way around. He also knows there are far worse things than holding Ed Murrow up to modern audiences and asking them to emulate his horse sense and innate fairness. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Murrow (David Strathairn) elegant and severe the dour straight shooter of postwar broadcast news prepares to go on air for his nightly report on CBS by lighting up a cigarette. I figured he was calming his nerves enjoying a smoke as a preshow ritual. But no. The camera blinks on the broadcast begins and Murrow is not only still smoking hes doing it flamboyantly -- his forearm planted on the desk his hand cocked in the manner of an aristocratic silent-movie star the entire report punctuated by the no-nonsense virility of his quick blustery drags. Since Good Night and Good Luck has been directed by George Clooney and written by Clooney and Grant Heslov as an unabashed salute to Murrow -- his courage and gravitas his devotion to reporting the truth in the face of corruption and power -- its a shock at least for those who didnt grow up with him to see this theatrical display of on-air indulgence. Murrow may have been a firebrand but he was every inch a showman too. Set in 1953 the year Murrow dared to expose and fight the bullying clampdown tactics of Sen. Joseph McCarthy Good Night and Good Luck is a curio an energized sliver of history smart sharp and lively staged with enjoyable panache yet so tidy and hermetic and limited in scope that its like a one-hour PBS documentary stretched into dramatic form. The film has been shot in silky black and white a look that evokes the burnished out-of-the-shadows romanticism of Citizen Kane and film noir as much as the buttoned-down world of 50s TV. Strathairn his hair greased back the furrows in his face lit like statuesque crags does a pitch-perfect imitation of Murrows granite scowl and dry-voiced almost caustic urgency and Clooney shoots him from dramatic low angles turning the broadcasts into charged nightly sermons. Good Night and Good Luck exudes a reverence for what it sees as the faded glory days of TV news yet its also more than a tad wistful for the era of Murrows cigarette -- for his self-conscious hard-boiled style of truth-telling. The movie salutes Murrows integrity by turning integrity into nostalgia. In his second outing as a director Clooney expertly evokes the revved split-second drama of the early days of live TV when even the most serious news report could be ""edited"" together at the moment it was being shown. He has fun too with that homogenized 50s frivolousness as when Murrow does a hilarious interview with Liberace. Its no wonder that the tough newsman along with his producer Fred Friendly (played by Clooney as a genial ace politician) is eager to make waves. Drawn to the case of a man tossed out of the Navy for his shaky ""communist"" affiliations Murrow begins to report on McCarthy his just-the-facts-maam approach shading into righteous advocacy. The film turns into a black-and-white showdown of good and evil. McCarthy is seen flinging mud at witnesses in extended vintage news clips which are woven into the action as if no mere actor could have done justice to the senators sleazy shamelessness. Its a technique at once effective and self-canceling We get so caught up in the brutal reality of McCarthy that the movie itself comes to seem at times like mere decoration. After all why not show clips of Murrow too? You almost could considering the film never tries to dig beneath his flinty facade. The Murrow who fights McCarthy and stands up to CBS chairman William S. Paley played with worldly gruff force by Frank Langella is the only Murrow we see. Theres a reason that Good Night and Good Luck as nimble and craftsmanly as it is feels thin. The movies passion and in a sense its true subject remains off screen Its there in Clooneys presumption that the audience will see Murrow taking on McCarthy and make an analogy to the present day asking itself why no one in our corporatized media culture has dared to take a comparable fearless stand against the Bush administration. But the analogy is facile at best. George Bush whatever you may think of his policies isnt Joe McCarthy and its not as if his most fervent detractors in the press have been silenced. To suggest that the spirit of Edward R. Murrow has been crushed out of journalism is to turn nostalgia for the age of stern father-figure newsmen into the stuff of conspiracy theory. Good Night and Good Luck has a small-scale time-capsule fascination yet its hermeticism is really a form of moral caution -- a way of keeping the issues neat the liberal idealism untainted. ""Look"" the movie says. ""TV news once had room for heroes"" Well yes but Id have been more inspired if the film didnt have such unquestioned reverence for the age when freedom in media hinged on one saintly man saving the people from on high. 2006 Oscar Nominations Best Picture; Best Actor (David Strathairn); Best Director (George Clooney); Best Original Screenplay (George Clooney and Grant Heslov); Best Art Direction; Best Cinematography Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Watch Kelly Clarkson adorably forget the lyrics to her songs Katy Perry reveals which line of her DNC speech Orlando Bloom wrote Chandra Levy miniseries in works at TNT Nick Jonas Demi Lovato send fans on scavenger hunt for concert tickets Pokemon Go nests are reportedly spawning different Pokemon Disney changes Avengers Infinity War Part 1 title Constance Wu says Matt Damons Great Wall perpetuates racist myth Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

Murrow who successfully confronted the hysteria being whipped up by Sen. Joseph McCarthy. Strong critical reaction likely to emanate as well as off-entertainment page coverage will translate into an enthusiastic aud embrace in specialized release. A vital chapter of mid-century history is brought to life concisely with intimacy and matter-of-fact artistry in ""Good Night and Good Luck."" In his second directorial outing George Clooney pays tribute to the golden era of black-and-white 50s television drama and to a moment when a smart brave news broadcaster Edward R. Murrow successfully confronted the hysteria being whipped up by a political bully Sen. Joseph McCarthy; latter element assures pics status as the liberal feel-good movie of the year. Strong critical reaction likely to emanate from bows at the Venice and New York film festivals as well as extensive off-entertainment page coverage will translate into an enthusiastic audience embrace in specialized release although pics small scale and period setting will test Warner Independents ability to muscle such a film through to a more general public. From the first minute hes onscreen David Strathairn is Edward R. Murrow. From the lean physique and dark features to his taciturn air imperturbable disposition and implacable directness of address the habitually understated actor entirely inhabits the biggest screen role of his career. In a piece not intended as a psychological study Strathairn quietly suggests the ways in which Murrows challenge of McCarthy tested the depth of his characters nerve resolve and self-certainty. Its a tour de force performance of great subtlety in a deliberately narrow range. Framed by a speech Murrow gave at an industry tribute in 1958 script by Clooney and Grant Heslov is set between October 1953 and the spring of the following year with the action almost entirely confined to the CBS studios and offices. Focus remains intently upon intelligent aggressive professionals doing their jobs fielding information weighing its merits and making decisions based on the importance of news and the risks of putting it out over a new commercially driven medium. No time is spent explaining who Murrow and McCarthy were or even who was president; young or foreign auds not familiar with such basics will either have to get up to speed in advance or pay extra-close attention. At the outset the 45-year-old Murrow hosts two of the most notable shows on CBS-TV the news-and-commentary-oriented ""See It Now"" and the popular celebrity interview program ""Person to Person."" Against the background of demands for employee loyalty oaths and the communist witch hunts orchestrated by the senator from Wisconsin in his position as chairman of the Government Committee on Operations for the Senate the ""See It Now"" team takes up the cause of airman Milo Radulovich who has been summarily discharged from the armed forces without trial and based on sealed evidence. With the nervous backing of the network and despite pressure from military brass Murrow challenges the dismissal on the air with the figurative result of making McCarthy blink. Predictably however Murrow begins being painted with the same pinko brush thats short-circuiting the career of fellow CBS newsman Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise). Murrow must also endure tense meetings with his boss William Paley (Frank Langella) who while insisting his staff be politically ""clean"" and suggesting that the public prefers safe entertainment to topical controversy reminds his star broadcaster that he has never censored or disallowed anything Murrow wanted to put on the air. With newsroom action and dialogue flowing in the manner of 30s newspaper melodramas its not always entirely clear whos who and who does what. Most prominent however are Murrows ""See It Now"" producer Fred Friendly (Clooney) a dynamic collaborator and supporter of his on-air partner and Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) valued team members who due to network rules must keep their marriage secret. Paleys backing enables Murrow to go ahead with the March 9 1954 broadcast in which he takes on McCarthy by rebutting the smear campaign against him then by boldly spotlighting the senators lamentable technique of making accusations without evidence with the intent of stirring the public to rise against the prevailing climate of fear. Offered the opportunity to respond McCarthy persists in his unspecified slander of Murrow and others and fails to address the newsmans charges. As presented here Murrows successful confrontation with McCarthy can be seen as the beginning of the senators undoing; his hearings continued -- some viewers will be surprised to see archival footage of the young Robert Kennedy on the team with Roy Cohn during one of the latters harangues -- but the tide began turning leading to McCarthys censure by the Senate. A very amusing throwaway moment has Murrow genially conducting a live cross-country interview with Liberace while desperately trying to overhear details of the Army-McCarthy hearings. Clooney and his co-scenarist producer and fellow actor Heslov lay out the contemporary relevance of some of the issues for anyone to see particularly as regards civil liberties and the existence of an extreme socio-political divide in the United States. But they dont push it which frees the film from the dreaded limitation of preaching to the choir. In fact ""Good Night and Good Luck."" is the second picture this year from ostensibly liberal-left filmmakers (after the hit Sundance docu ""Why We Fight"") to use speeches by President Eisenhower to endorse their perspectives on post-war American history. Robert Elswits agile lustrous black-and-white lensing mixes beautifully with the vintage 16mm and kinescope material in which McCarthy himself and others are seen. While Clooneys elegant on-the-move visual style makes no attempt to match the more static high-contrast look of 50s TV it is nevertheless highly evocative of it providing a rich atmosphere for the densely packed drama. All other design elements from the credible newsroom and studio sets to the detail of the period equipment are exemplary. Strathairn is first among equals in the exemplary ensemble with Clooneys vigorous Friendly Langellas polished and authoritative Paley and the more understated duo of Downey and Clarkson making the strongest impressions. Led by the chain-smoking Murrow whose persona was not complete without a cigarette in hand practically everyone here smokes like a furnace so much so that the anti-smoking-in-movies fanatics would have to slap ""Good Night and Good Luck."" with a XXX rating. With saner heads still prevailing pic is rated PG enabling younger audiences the unimpeded opportunity of a thoroughly absorbing glimpse into recent history.
