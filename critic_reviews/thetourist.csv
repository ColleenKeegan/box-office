Quite a lot actually. Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie Venice -- what more could you want from a movie? Quite a lot actually judging by ""The Tourist"" an all-too-resistible Euro-chic trifle that marks an undistinguished Hollywood debut for German talent Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Like a beautifully tailored suit that starts to smell funny after a few minutes this sumptuous but stultifying lark sets up a quasi-Hitchcockian intrigue between two strangers abroad but smothers any thrills or sparks in a haze of self-regard. The considerable eye candy of its stars and locations aside Sony release may not rack up much B.O. mileage domestically though international prospects look healthy. Admittedly there was little reason to expect von Donnersmarck to spin this work-for-hire into a sophomore outing as accomplished as his knockout 2006 writing-directing debut ""The Lives of Others."" And he scarcely deserves all the blame for a production whose creative team has seen more revolving doors than Venices famous Hotel Danieli (shown to nice effect here). A remake of 2005s little-seen French thriller ""Anthony Zimmer"" the film was conceived as a vehicle for Charlize Theron and Tom Cruise (who was briefly replaced by Sam Worthington) just as von Donnersmarck was preceded by Bharat Nalluri in the directors chair. Factor in a much-rewritten screenplay (Julian Fellowes Christopher McQuarrie and the helmer receive onscreen credit) and one almost begins to admire the final product for at least achieving a state of marginal coherence. One morning in Paris (France were helpfully informed) the exquisite Elise Ward (Jolie) strolls down to her favorite cafe and receives a letter from her lover Alexander Pearce whom we eventually learn is an elusive high-class thief wanted for stealing 744 million. Her actions are closely monitored by a team of Scotland Yard detectives led by Inspector Acheson (Paul Bettany high-strung) whose determination to collar Pearce borders on obsession. Following Pearces exact instructions Elise hops a Venice-bound train where she subtly puts the moves on Frank Tupelo (Depp) a random slightly rumpled American traveler whose provenance (""a math teacher from Wisconsin"") is the scripts idea of a joke worth repeating. Employing an arsenal of suggestive glances and coy one-liners Elise contrives to throw the cops off the scent by making them think Frank is Pearce. Something feels amiss with this wrong-man setup from the get-go. With his longish hair signature goatee and vaguely European bearing Depp is precisely no ones idea of an American average Joe and the choice immediately raises eyebrows as well as questions about the films intentions As Elise verbally seduces Frank the Yank in a first-class dining car are we watching a luxuriant transcontinental thriller or a sly self-aware comic exercise? Are Depp and Jolie trying to channel Cary Grant and Eva Marie-Saint in ""North by Northwest"" or is something weirder and more inscrutable afoot? No answers are immediately forthcoming and the films pulse quickens only modestly once the two arrive in Venice where Elise is torn between her devotion to the unseen Pearce and her sudden unaccountable feelings for Frank. Complicating matters further is the arrival of an English crime boss (Steven Berkoff enlivening the proceedings with real menace) on Pearces trail initiating a series of unexciting chases -- sometimes by boat sometimes over rooftops -- in which Elise and Frank keep alternating between rescuer and rescued their identities a continual matter of suspicion for the other characters and the audience. Presumably viewers are meant to find all this mystery thrillingly romantic and by dint of its setting alone ""The Tourist"" is not without a certain elegance. As he demonstrated in ""The Lives of Others"" von Donnersmarck is a classicist with a clean unfussy visual style and a refreshing aversion to the frenetic editing schemes so in vogue among contempo action-thrillers; he also tends to lean too heavily on music (an alternately jittery and swoony concoction by James Newton Howard). As for Venice the worlds most improbably gorgeous city has rarely looked better on film lensed in sweeping overhead shots that accentuate its sun-drenched beauty as opposed to its after-dark decay. Nor should one disregard the pleasures of watching two glamorous actors in motion whether its Jolie entering a ballroom coiffed like Sophia Loren or Depp riffing on his own debonair persona. But what lingers long after ""The Tourist"" has faded is the sense that amid all the rehashes and behind-the-scenes musical chairs someone decided that Jolie and Depps combined star wattage not to be confused with actual romantic chemistry would be enough -- not only to carry the script through its shopworn duplicitous doings but to make audiences care in the first place.

It should have been a great thriller but it ended up being a pretty lame one with two great actors and a decent supporting cast. howardsaid on Monday March 28 2011 85151 AMgreat movie well worth the time.would not have guessed the ending.4 1/2 stars. Gracesaid on Thursday January 27 2011 10933 PMI love Johnny Depp and the story. But there is definitely something wrong with the pace. I would give it B- actually... Glennsaid on Thursday January 13 2011 111649 PMDont read spoiler comment by Harlan below. Thanks a lot Harlan. I wont be watching this movie now. Not Douchebag Harlonsaid on Thursday January 13 2011 110149 PMDont read Harlans comment below as his comment purports to give away the movie. What a douche Katesaid on Sunday January 09 2011 23414 PMI enjoyed this movie very much. I love Venice so I considered her to be another of the movies stars. I figured out what was going on near the end of the film. I thought the stars had chemistry and I liked the plot twists. I guess there wasnt enough violence for most critics. They love the senseless violence as per Scorceses over the top dramas and this one was a little lacking on that kind of violence for violences sake. Harlan said on Tuesday December 28 2010 120214 AMI thought this movie was excellent. I would have given it a B+ if not an A because it had everything in it from acting direction score cinematography AND even storyline. It kept me on my toes until the very last scene because I didnt get it untill Depp revealed that HE was the Pearce. Great suspense and it should be a movie of the year contender. 4/ 5 in my books.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 10 2010 303 PM Avoid This Trap The Tourist reviewed with optional spoilers so you wont have to see it. By Dana Stevens Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in The Tourist. Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck why? Ach du lieber Gott warum? After the thing of beauty that was The Lives of Others (2006) a stately serene meditation on love art and surveillance in Cold War-era East Germany why did you accept the mission to direct a hacky slab of Hollywood bologna like The Tourist (Sony Pictures)? For a good half of this movie I tried to convince myself you knew what you were doing that you were pulling some sort of Douglas Sirk move a Europeans riff on the genre tropes of mainstream American cinema. Any second now you would surely take this garden-variety international spy romp to some unexpectedly postmodern place. Until you didnt and the last hour of the movie foundered in a morass of unearned epiphanies improbable chase scenes and the kind of enraging last-minute plot twists that abruptly rob the foregoing film of any and all possible meaning. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I doubt it will be possible to express the full force of my annoyance at The Tourist without at least one optional mouse-over spoiler but first the setup. Angelina Jolie is Elise Clifton-Ward an Englishwoman of mystery (cop? spy? con artist?) who boards a train to Venice after receiving an enigmatic summons while sitting in a Paris cafe. On the train she meets and inconclusively flirts with an American math teacher on holiday Frank Tupelo (Johnny Depp) whom she may or may not be setting up as the fall guy for the team of Interpol agents and Scotland Yard detectives who are hot on her trail. Once they arrive in Venice Elise invites the scruffy hapless Frank to be her guest in a sumptuous suite at a historic luxury hotel. (Put your mouse here for an optional spoiler  .) Advertisement Over the next few days the ever-poised Elise and the ever-confused Frank dash around Venice pursued by Russian thugs in the employ of a sociopathic English gangster (Steven Berkoff) and placed under constant surveillance by a Scotland Yard investigator (Paul Bettany). What all these people want from them--as well as the identity and intentions of the man who summoned Elise to Italy--remains obscure until the movies final minutes (and at least for this viewer beyond). But its not so much the nonsensical nature of the plot that rankles; its the movies wrongheaded approach to the material. Basically this movie is an excuse for two movie stars (and if were being honest the director and crew) to hang out in a glamorous European location chasing a Hitchcockian MacGuffin. It ought to be a glitzy silly spoof of the kind of old-fashioned movie in which such things actually happened. Instead The Tourist takes its cliches straight up. I kept waiting for the absurdity of Jolies character--an uber-competent operative who can traverse Europe with only a gold clutch for luggage without ever getting a smudge on her white couture frock--to be punctured with some sort of self-deprecating joke. Surely Depp would walk in on her by mistake in the hotel and find her in curlers and a cold-cream face mask watching the Eurovision contest on TV? But no Elise really is model-beautiful and irreproachably cool at all times. Who could fall in love with such a perfect bore? Though shes given virtually nothing to do but sashay down train platforms in designer outfits I will say that I enjoy how much Angelina Jolie enjoys being a movie star. In many scenes--especially a chase in which she expertly pilots a motorboat through the canals of Venice--Jolie resembles Sophia Loren and carries herself with a similar air of feline self-satisfaction. But von Donnersmarck seems gobsmacked by his leading ladys beauty; he can get no distance on it and what could have been an affectionate sendup of Jolies outsized off-screen persona instead becomes a film-length fashion shoot. As for Depp his character makes so little sense that he can hardly be blamed for blinking his way through the movie with an expression of blank-faced puzzlement that recalls Dan Quayle in the 1988 vice-presidential debate. If you want to know the plot twist that provides this movies final audience-insulting indignity place your mouse here  . Go ahead and do it; youre not really going to see The Tourist are you?

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 10 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 10 2010 1254AM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Two of the most glamorous stars in movies today a legendarily beautiful location a mistaken-identity mystery - who could object? Though all the elements in The Tourist appear lined up for an adventure tale to take us away from bleak winter what should have sizzled fizzles. The main responsibility goes to German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. This is his sophomore effort after his grimly impressive 2006 Oscar winner The Lives of Others about life under the East German police state. Obviously intent on making a change of direction he seems to have lost his compass entirely in this long-in-the-making attempt at a suave contemporary Hitchcockian pastiche. Based on a 2005 French film Anthony Zimmer the plot here is a patchwork of improbabilities which labours to distract from its cracks through star wattage and a superficial coat of polish. The results arent terrible just curiously underwhelming given the movies potential. Jolie appears first in a cafe scene in Paris as Elise a suspect whos being ogled by a van-load of English detectives (led by Paul Bettany) as she sashays down a street to get her morning coffee. Shes dressed like a runway model and wearing enough makeup to open her own Sephora outlet. Obviously shes in top-secret mode. At the cafe shes passed a note from a wanted man named Alexander Pearce burns it and departs. Fully conscious of the team of cops following her she boards the train to Venice. She passes a series of men eating her up with their gazes as she moves down the first-class carriage before she settles on an empty seat opposite Frank (Depp) a humble math teacher from Wisconsin apparently travelling through Europe to mend a broken heart. Elises strategy is to throw the detectives off-track but the wrong information also gets in the hands of another pursuer an English psycho billionaire (Steve Berkoff credibly menacing) and his gang of Russian goons none of whom knows what the real Alexander looks like. Through her innumerable costume changes Jolie provides a nice fashion shoot but with her stiff English accent and struggling under the weight of her eyelashes she gives no evidence of a personality beneath the facade. Depp looking slightly heavy and with an unflattering bouffant is mildly amusing with his hesitations and fidgety mannerisms but his performance feels untypically sluggish and indecisive. Otherwise the movie pads out its thriller plot with chase scenes - over red-tiled rooftops or by speedboat through the canals - that work neither as action nor slapstick no matter how emphatically James Newton Howards score tries to steer our responses. Over the course of the action Elise gives Frank lessons on how to man up and somehow we are led to believe they have fallen in love without any discernible onscreen chemistry to support it. The best that can be said for this misfire of a movie is that it lives up to its title. Veteran cinematographer John Seale ( Cold Mountain The Talented Mr. Ripley) shoots Venice beautifully in aerial views or through the piazzas and waterways at night. Even Johnny and Angelinas cheekbones dont stand a chance competing with the view from the Grand Canal.

Not so in The Tourist a playful tribute to the 1963 Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn vehicle Charade . From the first scene in which Jolie saunters through the streets of Paris like someone poured out of a bottle she is appropriately at home playing a coveted woman. Between Jolie and Johnny Depp who mutes the antics on display in his numerous Pirates and Tim Burton movies The Tourist offers up the sexiest star power of the season. Thats why we go see a movie like this the chance to take in charismatic and attractive people playing cat and mouse in exotic locales and giving us a break from the everyday. The trick works here buttressed by some capable storytelling chops and supporting players.Jolie plays Elise not on the run so much as a relaxed trot from police who want to arrest her husband a mystery man who has stolen billions from a sadistic gangster (Steven Berkoff an accomplished graduate of Bond Villain University via Octopussy) and millions from the British government. Fleeing to Venice on a train she ensnares a soft-spoken math teacher (Depp) in her escape tactics. This gives the twosome a chance to look into each others eyes a lot and dodge the boys from Scotland Yard (represented by Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton).Shes English hes American. Shes assured hes confused. They want each other. Yet as they say not all is as it seems. Hmm.With its identity intrigue and lovers-on-the-run premise The Tourist recalls a disappointing release from earlier this year Knight and Day. But director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (The Lives of Others ) replaces that films frenzied tone with the dry cool of a gin martini. Theres almost nothing serious about The Tourist; even when the heroes are imperiled - dashing across Venice rooftops or staring down the barrel of a gun - theres a saunter to their steps an understanding that the stakes really arent too high and theres some fun to be had. Too many movies ask us to buy midrange talent as bona fide stars. The Tourist has the real deal and it revels in that comfort.The Tourist is a polished romantic distraction and a brief trip along the canals of Venice with some assured company. Its a nice piece of counterprogramming for the season that finds most movies jockeying for year-end prestige and awards and for a weekend that draws the kids off to Narnia. The Tourist merely asks you to sit back and enjoy the ride and then makes that task a breeze.Follow movie critic Chris Vognar on Twitter chrisvognar.Directed by Florian Henckel von DonnersmarckStarring Angelina Jolie Johnny Depp Paul Bettany Timothy Dalton and Steven BerkoffRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (violence and brief strong language) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 9 2010 Save for later Saved Johnny Depp (l.) and Angelina Jolie are shown in a scene from the new film The Tourist. Sony Pictures/Columbia Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of To see Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in ""The Tourist"" is like watching a chemistry experiment gone horribly wrong. You would think that these two stellar sexpots would set off royal fireworks - not to mention that both of them can when the spirit moves them really act.No such spirit is in the wind here. This is the first Hollywood job by the German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who directed the Oscar-winning espionage drama ""The Lives of Others."" About the only thing ""The Tourist"" has in common with that film is a fetishistic fascination with surveillance techniques.Jolie who these days is looking more and more like a reanimated mannequin from a Saks window display plays Elise a British woman of mystery who is being tailed by Interpol and Scotland Yard (but not refreshingly by the paparazzi). She meets up for the first time on a train to Venice with Frank a vacationing community college math teacher from Wisconsin. Perhaps Depp looking puffy and cushiony overdoes the versimilitude of his characterization Hes about as exciting as a community college math teacher from Wisconsin. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Elise is attached to a mysterious entity an ex-inamorata named Alexander Pearce who is being sought by both the British police and the mob for absconding with bales of stolen mob money. The gimmick here is that Frank whom Elise cozies up to in her androidlike way keeps getting mistaken for Alexander whom we never see. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? All this nonsense is essentially window-dressing for the two movie-star mannequins. I have no objection whatever to star vehicles designed solely to show off the luminescence of their luminaries - ""Charade"" and ""To Catch a Thief"" are two of the most enjoyable movies ever made.But star power even at this pay grade must be continually validated. Depp has long since proved himself one of the most bizarrely inventive movie actors since Brando so perhaps hes entitled to the occasional snooze (although perhaps not on our dime). But Jolie in movie after movie has transformed herself into a not-so-special-effect. Her action-toy blankness worked in ""Salt"" because her character was all armature. In ""The Tourist"" shes supposed to be playing a woman in love.From the looks of it the only thing she seems to be in love with is her lip gloss. Grade D+ (Rated PG-13 for violence and brief strong language.)-----More Monitor movie reviews Recent Movie Reviews Star Trek Beyond is consistently entertaining Norman Lear Just Another Version of You is a testimonial to an icon The Innocents The subject of the film is more arresting than the movie Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

Comments (2) click to enlarge The Tourist Video Rated PG-13  103 minutes  2010 A Wisconsin math teacher vacationing in Europe (Johnny Depp) gets swept into an international intrigue by a slinky babe (Angelina Jolie) who wants the agents surveilling her to mistake him for her money-laundering lover. This swanky Euro-thriller kneels at the altar of Alfred Hitchcock and its second-hand North by Northwest plot is particularly entertaining when you realize that the suave and quick-thinking Cary Grant persona has been inherited by Jolie not Depp. Unfortunately this is one of those movies with a twist ending that turns a key character inside out revealing earlier scenes to be essentially fraudulent and more or less invalidating ones emotional investment in the story. No one ever walked out of a Hitchcock movie feeling as cheated as this made me feel.

Turns out stupidity isnt one of them. The Tourist Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Cast Angelina Jolie Johnny Depp Paul Bettany. Rating PG-13 for violence and brief strong language. Spotlight Johnny Depp | Angelina Jolie Spy movies | SHOWTIMES Nor is a lack of chemistry when those stars are tossed into the same orbit. Throw in the feeling that they arent really trying but instead showed up for the mondo payday and the first-rate locations and you have . . . well you have ""The Tourist"" with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp a movie that is difficult to characterize as a disappointment because mediocrity seems to be what they were shooting for. Well done on that front then. The fact that its directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who also made ""The Lives of Others"" is all the more mystifying - certainly a bigger mystery than anything thats going on in the film. Jolie plays Elise Clifton-Ward a beautiful woman under surveillance by French authorities in Paris when the film opens. Why were not sure but theyre a bumbling bunch. A mysterious card arrives telling her to meet its sender in Venice - but to first pick out a man of the authors height and build and make the cops believe its the author. While walking through the train to Italy her eyes land on Frank Tupelo (Depp) an unsuspecting math teacher from Wisconsin. Perfect. We learn along the way that the man who sent the card to Elise is Alexander Pearce who has stolen more than a billion dollars from a mobster (Steven Berkoff) who is just as interested in finding Pearce as the authorities if not more so. Thus begins a series of set pieces involving mistaken identity boat chases through the canals of Venice foot chases on the tiled roofs above them and more bumbling law-enforcement efforts to the chagrin of Acheson (Paul Bettany) whos in charge of the investigation. Frank reads mystery thrillers so he pieces things together over time. All the while Elise dresses to the nines; whenever she walks through a room eyes pop and jaws drop at the sight of her beauty. Its like a Tex Avery cartoon. There are some laughs mostly thanks to Depp who plays the small-time man in above his head with at least a little charm. But he and Jolie have no chemistry to speak of. At one point he tells her ""You are the least down-to-Earth person Ive ever met"" and that haughtiness even if its part of her character is off-putting. The movie is more fun when Depp is on his own which isnt what youd hope for in a pairing of these two. Mostly though the story is just ridiculous with silly twists and obvious turns. Its stars are attractive and the settings are gorgeous making ""The Tourist"" OK to visit for a while. But you know what they say You wouldnt want to live there.

Columbia Pictures Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie in Columbia Pictures ""The Tourist"" (Columbia Pictures) Frank (Johnny Depp) and Elise (Angelina Jolie) meet on a train thats bulleting through a picturesque European landscape. Hes reading a book and minding his own business when she takes a seat beside him. Elise is the kind of woman for whom heads routinely turn and suddenly the book doesnt seem so important.Clearly shes a femme fatale as anyone whos seen a Hitchcock film could tell you. And just as clearly Frank is smitten. So much so that he doesnt object when he somehow winds up sharing a hotel suite with her. Neither does he complain when she points out that hell be sleeping on the couch. But Frank begins to suspect that hes in over his head when two Russian thugs show up at the suite and shoot at him. That ""fatale"" in femme fatale is there for a reason.After its promising beginning ""The Tourist"" proves to be an inconsequential shrug of a film a would-be light thriller thats so deficient in the genres essentials -- such as witty dialogue intriguing characters and surprising yet credible plot turns -- that youre embarrassed for everyone involved. This remake of a French film is particularly disappointing coming from German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who earned international acclaim for his Oscar-winning 2006 drama ""The Lives of Others"" but might have been a bit too eager to go Hollywood. Von Donnersmarck shares credit for the appallingly lackluster script with Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") and Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park""). One can only assume that McQuarrie and Fellowes accepted the assignment as a hedge against the economic downturn. As for Depp and Jolie they look good together and they have considerable chemistry. But even their biggest fans will be hard-put to work up any enthusiasm for their latest effort.""The Tourist"" needs to have its passport revoked. Find movie showtimes Nov 11 2010 (...)

"The Tourist review Venice-set thriller is pretty but ultimately not all that thrilling |       NJ.com comments The Tourist review Venice-set thriller is pretty but ultimately not all that thrilling Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 10 2010 at 806 AM View/Post Comments View full sizeJohnny Depp finds intrigue in the form of Angelina Jolie in ""The Tourist."" Remember when Hollywood made romantic cat-and-mouse thrillers for grown-ups? When the locations were real not CGI and the plots had an American innocent (Gregory Peck say) twisted around the finger of a femme fatale like Sophia Loren? Well so do the makers of ""The Tourist."" What they particularly seem to remember are not so much Hitchcock movies as the fluffy Hitchcockian ones from the early 60s full of tricky capers and colorful baddies and so thick with old-fashioned glamour you could spread them on toast. But re-creation is not as easy as remembrance. ""The Tourist"" stars Angelina Jolie as a wealthy shady lady on the run and Johnny Depp as a community college math teacher -- I can hear enrollments in community college math classes exploding now -- whom she briefly uses as a decoy to help her elude her pursuers. But then the decoy falls for the beauty. And joins her in adventure as they go on the run from both bad guys and good guys while zipping around pretty Venice. The movie models are pretty clear. The motivations of characters shift as easily as Cary Grants in ""Charade."" And Jolies look -- lots of softly swinging silk piled-up hair and smoky eye shadow -- is familiar enough to send a suspicious Sophia off to check her closet. Movie Review The Tourist (PG-13) Sony (104 min.) Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. With Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS But -- do I need to say this? -- Johnny Depp is not Cary Grant. Angelina Jolie is not Sophia Loren. Jolie comes closer to channeling her iconic inspiration mostly because the script asks her only to be quiet mysterious and gorgeous. But Depp needs to be simultaneously approachable and be-still-my-heart charming -- and thats a much tougher assignment. He tries hard as does director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (whose last film was the immeasurably more serious ""The Lives of Others""). And in keeping with this films retro inspirations there are thankfully none of modern Hollywoods cheap sex jokes or editing-by-Cuisinart. But few thrills either. Although those old movies were restrained they still gave us startling scenes. Like Grants rooftop hand-to-hook fight with George Kennedy in ""Charade."" Or Peck hiding out in a shower in ""Arabesque"" -- only to be confronted by an extravagantly naked (or so you had to imagine) Loren. But much as it clearly admires those films ""The Tourist"" doesnt have anything nearly as exciting or teasingly erotic -- just a few not very fast chases through the Venetian canals and a lot of Significant Glances between Depp and Jolie. (Not to mention a truly annoying last-minute ""twist"" that makes nonsense of a lot of whats gone before.) Of course Venice itself looks beautiful. Both stars look beautiful. And everybody seems to be having a wonderful glamorous time. Too bad most of the fun on-screen seems to be reserved for the people who actually made ""The Tourist"" -- while all we get is a postcard.

Photo Stiff as a drink Johnny Depp is more convincing as Willie Wonka than as Angelina Jolies protector and love interest in ""The Tourist."" ( ) Angelina Jolie sets sail in the Venice-based clunker ""The Tourist. ( ) ""You are the least down-to-earth person Ive ever met"" someone tells Angelina Jolies character in what may be the understatement of the century. In the dud thriller ""The Tourist"" Jolie basically plays an overdressed humorless live-action version of Jessica Rabbit running around Venice dodging hired killers. Jolie who oddly never picks up a gun is joined in boring chases through the canals and over the rooftops by Johnny Depp -- with whom she has no romantic chemistry whatsoever no matter how many passionless kisses they share. PHOTOS JOHNNY DEPPS LEADING LADIES PHOTOS THE TOURIST PREMIERE Mostly Depp has the unenviable task of selling the implausibilities of this silly Hitchcock homage which was scripted by three Oscar winners -- director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (""The Lives of Others"") Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") and Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park""). The basic setup is that Jolies character Elise -- a mystery lady with an instantly guessed secret -- has been contacted in Paris by an ex-lover whos stolen zillions of dollars and changed his appearance through plastic surgery to elude detection. The ex-lover sends a note asking Elise to take a train to Venice -- and along the way to pick up a stranger of his size and build so the authorities will think its him. Because Elise is played by Angelina Jolie with Madonnas old British accent she has no problem acquiring a doppelganger in Depps Frank. Hes identified as a widowed American math professor. Lets just say Depp is more believable as Capt. Jack Sparrow or Willie Wonka. Depp has an even harder time convincing us that Frank would not only continue to hang around but volunteer to protect Elise whom he barely knows after bullets shatter the door of the suite in the five-star hotel that they chastely share. Even their pursuers -- teams led by a mobster (Steven Berkoff) and a Scotland Yard big shot (Paul Bettany) -- arent terribly colorful in a movie where action scenes are few and far between. You would think that three Oscar winners would be able to come up with a single memorable line between them. Saying that Jolies character ""tends to fall in love with anyone shes spent more than a train ride with"" isnt exactly a ""North by Northwest""-grade quip. Von Donnersmarck who brilliantly depicted government surveillance in East Berlin before the fall of the wall in his earlier German film astonishingly cant even find a way to make Interpols spying interesting here. And he utterly fails to avoid telegraphing the big twist ending halfway through the film. The director and his veteran cinematographer John Seale do offer plenty of nice shots of Venice -- though in all truth Jolie is the main scenic attraction. ""The Tourist"" sums itself up in a single line of dialogue ""Who would have thought your tastes were so provincial?"" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Doors Jim Morrison pardoned for indecent exposure Read Next Doors Jim Morrison pardoned for indecent exposure Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43460 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21100 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18381 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie Paul Bettany Rufus Sewell Timothy Dalton Ralf Moeller Raoul Bova Steven Berkoff Clement Sibony Igor Jijikine Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck Release Opened Dec 10 2010  Editorial Review They should have traveled aloneBy John AndersonFriday December 10 2010So much of life comes down to bad lighting. Too little you go blind. Too much and the flaws become as glaringly obvious as the cockroaches scurrying back under the wallpaper. That said ""The Tourist"" isnt exactly the movie equivalent of a passport picture. But the high wattage of stars Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie cast the film in a spotlight that would be unflattering for most movies least of all an insubstantial tension-free thriller like this. Shot in Paris Venice and against a few backdrops that seem to have originated in Burbank ""The Tourist"" is based on the 2005 French film ""Anthony Zimmer"" which is a bit odd since unsuccessful movies dont usually spawn remakes. Its also based on the old mistaken-identity trope and as such suggests a romantic hybrid like ""To Catch a Thief"" (Hitchcock) or ""Charade"" (faux-Hitchcock). Suggestion is as far as it gets. Less evocative of a Grace Kelly/Audrey Hepburn heroine than one made out of porcelain Jolie portrays Elise Clifton-Ward a woman of profound mystery who has brought her clipped British accent and rather dubious wardrobe to Paris where she hopes to reconnect with her lover the master criminal Alexander Pierce. Pierce it should be noted communicates with Elise via handwritten messages on monogrammed stationery. Just wanted you to know. One of those notes tells Elise to get on a train to Venice sidle up to the first guy who vaguely resembles Alexander and thus confuse Scotland Yard and its desperate lead detective Acheson (Paul Bettany) who has built up a reservoir of hate for the elusive Alexander. When Elise foists herself upon Frank Tupelo (Depp) a kind of dopey junior college math teacher from Wisconsin Acheson is confused at first. Most bewildered of course is Frank who suddenly finds himself in the middle of international intrigue. If anyone had asked us we would have advised Twentieth Century Fox not to put Depp and Jolie together. Both are if nothing else decidedly solo acts Jolie made the recent ""Salt"" work but only because she was allowed to own the entire movie; Depp hasnt played a plausible 21st-century human since ""Secret Window"" in 2004. Since then he has been doing his Keith Richards impersonation in those pirate movies or playing quasi-animated characters for Tim Burton and Terry Gilliam. (He has even lent his voice to ""SpongeBob SquarePants."") Are these performers whom one expects or even wants to see uncomfortably cuddling up to each other? No. Its too gruesome. More gruesome even than what happens to Frank who is shot at arrested accosted by Russians dragged through the canals of Venice and threatened with death by the sinister Ivan Demidov (a welcome Steven Berkoff). In the interim Frank falls in love with Elise. It takes about 47 seconds. We dont buy any of it. Nor do we swallow the counterfeit Euro-stylings of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck the German-born director whose Stasi drama ""The Lives of Others"" won the Best Foreign Film Oscar for 2006. Though it may be heretical to say it given that films awards pedigree ""The Lives of Others"" was frequently marred by the same cheap sentimentality and emotional shortcuts that hamper ""The Tourist."" In a rather cavalier fashion Von Donnersmarck implies certain qualities without his movie actually creating inhabiting or working for them - including the nervous tension that should accompany the chase scenes and the eroticism however anemic that might have arisen out of the Depp-Jolie matchup. Frank for instance is supposed to be in Italy recovering from the death of his wife. But he apparently finds Elises attention so therapeutic its never mentioned again. (This is supposed to happen of course - if God didnt want Depp and Jolie to get together he wouldnt have given us Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. But make an effort. Please.) As besotted as he seems to be by his cast von Donnersmarck is also in thrall to any number of other movies and directors including ""The French Connection"" from which he borrows Elises Paris Metro escape and a dance scene that seems straight out of Gilliams ""The Fisher King."" Cinema-as-shoplifting is okay as long as you still get the feeling its for a greater good. But thats something ""The Tourist"" is sorely missing.Contains violence and vulgarity.

Angelina Jolie as ""Elise"" and Johnny Depp as ""Frank"" in Columbia Pictures THE TOURIST. Photo Peter Mountain Sony Pictures The Tourist review Jolie Depp lost in misfire 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Tourist Suspense. Starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Stardom can be a beautiful thing. Channeled into the right material and then guided by a strong hand stardom can enhance a story by giving it the extra dimension that only comes with star image and personality Gable is Rhett Butler but hes also Gable and that interplay has fascinated and satisfied audiences for 70 years. But stardom can also be a dangerous substance. When handled incorrectly - when a director is either too in love with his actors or too cowed by them or both - stardom can take a terrific story and turn it into a festival of preening earnestness and precious mugging. There are all kinds of bad movies in the world but its really only stardom that can create the exact variety of cinematic abortion we find in ""The Tourist."" The film is based on a 2005 French film called ""Anthony Zimmer"" which almost nobody has seen except I have and its a blast - 85 minutes shot out of a cannon a nerve-racking entertaining sexy romantic and suspenseful picture - perhaps not a classic but a cant-miss good solid movie. So the makers of ""The Tourist"" had something surefire to work with - and then wrecked it by trying to guarantee that at every moment of this thriller the audience adores and feels right about the films two stars Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. Related Stories The Tourist The story concerns a mystery woman (Jolie) who gets a letter from her swindler lover who is on the run from both the police and the Russian mob. He instructs her to take a train pick a passenger at random and entice him back to her hotel. This way the mobsters and the police will think this poor schnook is the guy theyre looking for. With this one plot device two very interesting things are set in motion. The first is that a beautiful glamorous woman is seducing an average nobody and so he thinks this is his lucky day. He thinks his inner virtues are finally being appreciated. Thats funny. The second interesting thing is that the woman - a character were inclined to like - is doing something terrible targeting an innocent man for death. Whats more shes doing it willfully and heartlessly. Now thats a tense situation. Thats something to grab an audiences attention. But wait no hold it we have stars here. We cant have the audience thinking even for one second that Jolie is evil so the movie has to soften her motives. As for Depp he cant be average. No he has to be quirky and engaging some unorthodox version of a cool guy. So shes transparently benign and hes cool and with those two little variations half the movies mystery and tension go right out the window. The rest of the movie is killed by the long long scenes of Jolie and Depp talking and looking deep into each others eyes. The conversations are sincere and heartfelt - we know this from James Newton Howards mellow soundtrack which tells us that theyre in love from the opening minutes. Thanks for the tip James because watching Jolie and Depp there is no sense of a true connection no impression of people who belong together - or even look good together. On the contrary they are too much of the same substance too much Creatures From the Land of Star. Give them a couple of mirrors and have them play the love scenes to their own reflections and their ardor would be more convincing. ""The Tourist"" is shot in Paris and Venice attractive locations to say the least and occasionally it feels a little like being on vacation but only a little and not for long. When Jolie and Depp arent trying to convince us that they love each other and that we should therefore love them too the movie has chase scenes and interludes of peril that just go thud. You want to write a chase scene that has no power? Easy. Have the bad guy tell his henchmen ""Dont kill him. I need him alive."" OK good nothing to worry about here. German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck co-adapted and directed ""The Tourist"" and if the name sounds familiar thats because he made ""The Lives of Others"" a few years back one of the best films of the last decade. So von Donnersmarck now has two features to his credit - a masterpiece and a bomb. Hes due for just a regular good movie. -- Advisory Action violence Johnny Depp smoking a mechanical cigarette.

"Movie review The Tourist - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movie StarMovie review The TouristJohnny Depp and Angelina Jolie arent especially thrilling in The Tourist in which even international intrigue and mistaken identity arent enough to overcome the lackluster chemistry.December 10 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic There is a moment in ""The Tourist"" when Johnny Depp turns to Angelina Jolie and asks ""Why is all this happening?"" Its a question moviegoers will be asking themselves as well.Lured into theaters by the pairing of the most seductive film stars working today audiences will be nonplussed to discover a not particularly thrilling thriller about mistaken identity that doesnt come close to living up to expectations.Adapted by a bunch of high-profile screenwriters (three are credited but there were reportedly more) from the 2005 French film ""Anthony Zimmer"" about an ordinary man drawn into an extraordinary world ""The Tourist"" is so lacking in pace involvement and excitement that by the time its numerous plot twists materialize we cant be bothered to care.Even the presence of director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (one of the credited writers along with Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes) doesnt make a difference. It is not given to everyone to direct frothy caper movies and by the evidence here the capable Von Donnersmarck who did the excellent Oscar-winning ""The Lives of Others"" is not one of the elect.Probably the most surprising factor in ""The Tourists"" underperformance is the startling lack of chemistry between Depp and Jolie. Any film in which the stars connect more intensely on the poster than on the screen is in a world of trouble and a combination of Jolie playing dress-up and Depp doing dressed down dooms their connection.""The Tourist"" begins in Paris with a crack French surveillance team focusing its attention on one Elise Clifton-Ward. As played by Jolie in a series of drop-dead outfits the femme-fatale-and-a-half Elise is less the flesh-and-blood woman Evelyn Salt was and more a well-dressed mannequin who wears clothes better than she engages emotions.Though she doesnt look particularly dangerous Elise has caught the eye not only of the French police but also of Scotland Yards Financial Crimes Division and even Italian Interpol. Thats because her inamorato Alexander Pearce is a financial wizard who is wanted in 14 countries and has ruffled feathers around the world with his fiscal chicanery.Since no one knows what Alexander looks like he has concocted a plan to throw the police off his trail. He instructs Elise to take the high-speed TGV to Venice select someone on the train who shares his height and build and try to persuade the worlds police that this harmless nobody is the great financial wizard.Since Depp looking bearded and intentionally frail is the only movie star on the Venice train Elise picks him for the task. Depp plays Frank Tupelo a math teacher from Wisconsin who is such a timid unworldly type he tries to be understood in Spanish when hes in Italy.Depp may be Heartthrob No. 1 for many moviegoers but his soul is the soul of a character actor and given half the chance he will flee playing the classic romantic lead. ""The Tourist"" gives Depp the excuse he needs to hide his formidable charisma but his insistence on underplaying Frank has a paralyzing effect on the on-screen connection between his character and Jolies.So even though Elise more or less adopts Frank even letting him stay in her suite her interest in him is never less than implausible. And when Frank finds himself thrown into a dangerous world of cut-throat killers and international intrigue his unforeseen ability to cope is not particularly convincing either.Because neither Depp nor Jolie bring real juice to the proceedings it is left to the supporting characters to provide what energy the film has. Both Steven Berkoff as the gangster Pearce stole 2.3 billion from and Paul Bettany as the British police inspector who wants to collect a 744-million tax bill are strong but to little effect.

Whenever a new one comes along they want to know where it ranks if at all in the pantheon that includes such classics as ""Raging Bull"" ""Rocky"" and ""The Champ."" In the case of ""The Fighter a perfectly remarkable movie directed by David O. Russell Id suggest a different pantheon one thats reserved for the sort of spectacularly toxic families dramatized by Eugene ONeill. While the film handles itself well in the ring its brilliant in the arena of a blue-collar family that brutalizes its younger son and best hope for worldly success in the name of sustaining him. Watch a clip from ""The Fighter"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. A single image bespeaks both venues--recurrent almost robotic spasms of sparring between Micky Ward who is played by Mark Wahlberg and his half brother Dicky Eklund played by Christian Bale. (These are two phenomenal performances in fundamentally different styles.) Its the familiar image of a boxer working with his trainer yet the two men are locked in another kind of combat as well. Dicky the trainer was once a promising fighter who went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard. (In a film based on a true story it remains a matter of dispute whether he knocked Sugar Ray down or whether his opponent simply slipped.) Now hes a wild-eyed crack-addicted caricature of his former self. Dicky may have taught his younger brother everything he knows about boxing but his continued presence as Mickys trainer has turned imprisoning. Instead of winning fights and moving up Micky stumbles from one seedy bout to another serving as a stepping stone for other fighters. Mr. Russell directed ""The Fighter"" with furious energy--the overlapping dialogue out-Altmans Robert Altman--and an exuberant sense of place (Lowell Mass. in the 1990s). The director has an unerring feel for his working-class characters and hes generous toward most of them though what he does with the brothers six sisters a kind of slatternly Greek chorus is hilariously grotesque. The script episodic but never uninteresting was written by Scott Silver Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson. Hoyte Van Hoytema did the gritty cinematography a far cry from the cool formal beauty of his work in ""Let the Right One In."" ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale as battling brothers in The Fighter. Paramount Pictures The production does all of its participants proud. Mr. Wahlberg who had long championed a feature film about the brothers chose to play the role thats initially distinguished by its passivity. His performance is truly distinguished and deeply affecting. Micky has become more of a punching bag than anything else. He supports his family by absorbing physical punishment. The flamboyant role belongs to Mr. Bale. At the outset he seems to be playing it for crackpot grandiosity--Dicky sees himself as the star of a documentary thats being made about his career--but the documentary proves to be anything but admiring and Mr. Bales performance grows into a chilling study of deterioration and rage. (In one brief but frightening moment his little son imitates him by taking a punch at a locker door.) Family is the films central issue and a flinty conundrum when do familial ties become shackles and chains? Mickys family isnt dysfunctional its ruthlessly functional in destructive ways. According to its matriarch and business manager Alice--a formidable performance by Melissa Leo--Dicky still knows whats best for his brothers dwindling career. But Alices steely authority meets its unlikely match in the person of Mickys new girlfriend Charlene a college dropout whos tending bar in a local tavern. (Shes played by Amy Adams who is as tough tender smart and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in ""Enchanted."" What an actress and what range) Once Charlene enters the fray the plot takes a few arbitrary lurches but also some thrilling turns. Against all odds ""The Fighter"" snatches hope and then elation from the jaws of grinding defeat. Watch a clip from ""The Tourist"" starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. ENLARGE Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in The Tourist. Columbia PIctures The Tourist Sometimes it can be grisly fun to watch a movie thats been kept from view until the last moment because the studio knows its a stinker. But watching ""The Tourist"" with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp is just plain grisly. This woefully botched mystery-adventure-thriller-caper-romance-comedy or whatever it was meant to be is no fun at all. In fact the film set in Venice is grisly plus saddening since it was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck the German filmmaker whose Oscar-winning debut feature ""The Lives of Others"" remains a recent treasure of the movie medium. Who knows how his pursuit of a Hollywood career landed him in such a rancid stew? The only clue is provided by surveillance. ""The Lives of Others"" was about East Germanys secret surveillance of its citizens whereas ""The Tourist"" involves the obsessive and sometimes electronic surveillance of Ms. Jolie as a sex object. She plays Elise a mysterious--or at least frozen-faced--sophisticate opposite Mr. Depps Frank who describes himself as a math teacher from Wisconsin. (The idiotic plot which never adds up has to do with money gangsters and mistaken identity.) Mr. Depp possibly expressing displeasure at the production as a whole plays his character with dead eyes and steadfast torpor. Ms. Jolies eyes arent dead exactly but theyre weirdly glazed and they work in concert with her pursed lips and exclamation-mark posture to create a kind of sex robot who swans around Venice as if on an invisible runway. Maybe that was her intention but no one could have intended what ""The Tourist"" came to be. Watch a clip from ""All Good Things"" starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. All Good Things Andrew Jareckis first narrative feature takes a fictional look at a once-notorious and still unsolved missing persons case. The result is a queasy combination of speculation and dramatic invention with the ring of half-truth though the co-stars Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst add as much color as they can--not much--to a monochromatic script. The case involved Kathie Durst the wife of Robert Durst the son of a wealthy New York real-estate magnate. When she disappeared in 1982 her husband came under immediate suspicion but her body was never found and he was never tried for her murder. Because he remains a free man the filmmakers have changed the real-life names but theyve retained many of the circumstances--the title was taken from the name of the Vermont health-food store that the couple opened early in their marriage. And they have left little doubt that Mr. Dursts surrogate David Marks was not only a tortured monster but a murderer. Seven years ago in his debut documentary feature ""Capturing the Friedmans"" Mr. Jarecki used a remarkable trove of home movies and video footage to probe the mysteries of a Long Island family torn apart by charges involving child pornography and pedophilia. The results were enthralling although mysteries remained. In ""All Good Things"" mystery and ambiguity are in short supply. The script draws insistently obvious psychological connections. Frank Langellas Sanford Marks the family patriarch and Davids father suffocates his scenes as well as Davids spirit with a doomy presence. While Ms. Dunsts Katie is lovely at first the single-minded writing reduces her to bleak cliches. As for Mr. Gosling hes one of our finest actors and I cant wait to see him later this month in ""Blue Valentine"" but his talents are mostly trapped by Davids eerie inwardness and inexpressiveness. In a movie that professes to reopen a cold case the heros inner life remains a closed book. The Company Men In a somber drama that plays like a requiem for the American Dream you may welcome a few frivolities like the bedroom scene when Maria Bellos glamorous hatchet woman Sally throws herself on Tommy Lee Joness Gene a veteran shipyard chief and says ""Tell me more about capital depreciation."" A feature film debut by the veteran TV writer-producer John Wells ""The Company Men"" tells us much about the human costs of a fragile economy by tracking the experience of three men during a savage spasm of corporate downsizing. The movie is set in the present and the picture isnt pretty. ""American heavy manufacturing is dead"" declares the CEO of a conglomerate that includes ship building. The trios task is to find life in the postindustrial ruins. (Roger Deakins did a stylish job as always of photographing not only the ruins but the offices and board rooms of the companys sleek headquarters.) In addition to Mr. Jones the cast includes Ben Affleck as Bobby a corporate executive who cant believe that downward mobility will threaten his suburban house his golf club or his Porsche (Kevin Costner plays Bobbys carpenter brother-in-law); and Chris Cooper as Phil an industrial counterpart to Willy Loman who definitely can put a nut to a bolt having begun his career as a welder. For all his years doing ""E.R."" and other top-line TV series Mr. Wells hasnt yet tailored his techniques to the big screen. His actors line readings can be erratic--though I very much liked Rosemarie DeWitts performance as Bobbys wife--and the episodic ""E.R.""-like structure of the script vitiates the films emotional impact. Still ""The Company Men"" takes on its big subject forthrightly and in an era of service industries and financial instruments it celebrates the virtue of making useful things. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Flirting With Disaster (1996) David O. Russells sensationally funny second feature grabs your attention in the opening seconds when its hero Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) announces the premise. Mel is adopted and has always wondered who his real parents are. Hes also married with a four-month-old baby boy. But he and his wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette) havent yet agreed on a name for their son because fatherhood has plunged Mel into an identity crisis that can be cured only by finding his roots. Tea Leoni is Tina Kalb the adoption agency case worker who wants to document his reunion for purposes of scholarly research. The Believer (2002) The mind of Danny Balint whos played with terrifying brilliance by Ryan Gosling works like a cracked prism that refracts lifes spectrum into black and white. Danny is Jewish a conceited yeshiva boy grown into a pugnacious young man. Danny is also an anti-Semitic skinhead who vandalizes synagogues and has no higher ambition in his cracked life than to kill Jews. Henry Beans remarkable film has troubled many viewers and no wonder. What its about is also what it requires for proper appreciation--the ability of the human mind to hold and even cherish diametrically opposite thoughts. Boiler Room (2000) Ben Affleck is Jim Young a charismatic bully--and acknowledged descendant of Alec Baldwins character in ""Glengarry Glen Ross""--riding herd on young wannabe millionaires as they pitch worthless stocks to gullible traders. Ben Youngers debut feature has dramatic energy--and money hunger--to match the giddy heights of the Dow at the time it was made. Giovanni Ribisi is the conflicted hero Seth Davis a judges son who dropped out of college to run an illegal casino in his apartment. The ensemble cast includes Vin Diesel Nia Long Tom Everett Scott and Nicky Katt. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

(THE TOURIST.) Joe Neumaier Thursday December 9 2010 225 PM Title The Tourist A woman drags an American into a mysterious Venice adventure. With Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (143). PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.Angelina Jolie Johnny Depp and Venice all look ravishing in ""The Tourist"" a movie with a more appropriate title than was likely intended. Because while its glamorous megastars smart behind-the-scenes talent and able supporting cast foster the illusion that what we have here is a well-planned-out Hitchcockian froth in reality it only strolls past the things people expect to see.This lethargic romantic thriller -- directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck whose previous film was 2006s Foreign Film Oscar winner ""The Lives of Others"" -- goes about its game so bloodlessly the result is some of the most unexciting action and seduction sequences in recent memory. And while Jolie and Depp have strengths that could be utilized in those areas each dials things down so low they seem to be in a tableau at Madame Tussauds.The dull setup introduces Elise Clifton-Ward (Jolie) a mysterious sexy Brit being followed around Paris by Interpol agents and Scotland Yard. She has just received a letter from her lover an enigma named Alexander Pearce telling her to board a train to Venice and find a man she could pass off as him. Pearce we discover is a financial criminal wanted for money he scammed from a tough gangster.Elise picks Frank (Depp) a scruffy math teacher from Wisconsin reading a spy novel and after a perfunctory flirt were in Venice where canal chases are paced to keep blood pressures low and black-tie galas and hidden safes provide devious elegance. To catch the thief Pearce everyone must trust Elise who isnt who she says she is and now is hot for the math teacher.Jolie and Depp though never go above simmer and nothing fills the void. Unlike 2008s ""Duplicity"" this isnt a movie built on cleverness. Its not ""Salt"" which found Jolie in cartoon spy country nor is it a get-paranoid nail-biter. Even its casting of Steven Berkoff as the gangster instead of a rent-a-villain like Bill Nighy or Terence Stamp is a clue that Henckel von Donnersmarck working from a script by Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") and Julian Fellowes (""Gosford Park"") wasnt interested in cookie-cutter cat-and-mouse tricks.Thats fine but what it all boils down to is an uninspired star matchup with travelogue shots thrown in. Jolie is gorgeous but photographed in reverent profile like a Roman coin. Depp is amusingly droll but it turns out that ""mild"" for this great actor looks a lot like ""sleepy."" That doesnt help when the trip ""The Tourist"" takes you on winds up a dozer not a doozy.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune December 10 2010 -- 250pm  Sony Pictures Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie do a dance of intrigue in ""The Tourist."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Tourist"" is a shaggy dog story about a shaggy man. Johnny Depp plays Frank Tupelo a rumpled woebegone Wisconsin math teacher traveling around Europe. Timid forlorn and rather inept (he thinks he can communicate in Italy by speaking Spanish) Frank is a real acting stretch for Depp. This unremarkable Everyman is by far the least compelling character the actor has ever played. Wearing a haircut resembling a dead beaver and looking puffy around the face Depp deliberately downplays his lady-killer looks and slows the speed of his intellect to a crawl. His performance gives us the perverse experience of seeing a dashing dazzling actor impersonate a passive bore. Its like watching a three-way lightbulb set on low wishing you could enjoy its untapped brilliance. Frank is swept up into a world of glamour and intrigue when hes approached on the Paris-Venice express by seductive Elise (Angelina Jolie). Shes the partner of Alexander a crooked banker on the lam since ripping off a gangster billionaire. After radical plastic surgery hes impossible to find. Because Frank is roughly the physical type of her runaway lover Elise picks him to be a decoy in a scheme to mislead Alexanders pursuers. Soon Interpol and the rich mans goons are on Franks trail with Elise popping into the picture to rescue the hapless traveler when the bad guys start trying to take him out. This sort of wrong-man yarn can work when its chockablock with wild escapades and witty banter which ""The Tourist"" is not. It is a hollow soulless exercise that ambles when it should sprint fumbling every opportunity to turn Franks misadventure into high adventure. Theres no anxiety in the chases. There is zero sexual tension between the regal Jolie and the bloated unkempt Depp who projects the appeal of a pile of sawdust. Scenes in which the ice queen thaws as she realizes what a good Joe she put in peril are utterly unconvincing. The actors deliver the scripts labored comic lines so poorly that you wince for them. Jolie is gorgeous but her one-note performance of regal bemusement quickly grows tiresome. Director and co-writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who displayed a powerful feel for drama with his Oscar-winning ""The Lives of Others"" struggles to find the right tone.The sight of Depp running over Venice rooftops in his pajamas is conceptually amusing but dismal as presented here. Franks dilemma is put in a new context with a major last-minute twist when we discover what a devious game the runaway Alexander has been playing. When the big secret is revealed its a moment the term ""anticlimax"" was designed for. Its the low point in a movie made of little more than low points. Enduring ""The Tourist"" is like going for a ride in a sinking gondola.

First it may be the only movie ever to feature a bad performance by Johnny Depp one of the best actors working in films. Who knew he could be wooden and unconvincing in a role? And Angelina Jolie his love interest in this laughably bad romantic thriller may be even worse. PHOTOS Travels with The Tourist INTERVIEWS Real Tourist attractions are Depp Jolie Jolie comes off like a cross between an alien and an impeccably attired mannequin. Her range of facial expressions goes from wide-eyed and serious to wide-eyed with a slight smile. The plot has more holes than a pair of Crocs and the entire tale doesnt have an iota of believability. What makes this all the more hard to fathom is that The Tourist was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who made one of the decades best films the Oscar-winning foreign film of 2006 Germanys The Lives of Others. The marriage of von Donnersmarck Depp and Jolie -- along with a supporting cast of actors such as Paul Bettany Rufus Sewell and Timothy Dalton and a gorgeous Venice setting -- would seem to be a no-brainer. But as the cliche goes it all comes down to the story. Jolie plays Elise a mysterious British woman who is under surveillance by Scotland Yard Interpol and a host of guys in suits talking into their sleeves. She also is being watched by various bad guys. Elise pointedly strikes up a conversation with a rather sad-looking guy on a train a math teacher from Wisconsin named Frank (Depp). Frank is meant to be nondescript even a tad frumpy. But Depp is hardly your go-to guy for that look. That doesnt matter because nothing is as it seems. But there are things that The Tourist definitely is tedious sluggishly directed and terribly written. Dialogue is beyond stilted as if badly translated from another language. Unintentional humor arises from banal lines dully delivered. When Frank is mystifyingly invited to join Elise in her magnificent Venetian palazzo suite he remarks ""This really is a very nice hotel isnt it?"" And the snore-inducing mood doesnt get any better even when the obligatory chase scenes occur. Perhaps the only selling point to The Tourist is its historic Italian setting. On all other fronts the film fails to make a connection. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Tourist is a slow and silly action-comedy romantic-thriller in which Angelina Jolie seduces then tries to ditch a disheveled Johnny Depp in Venice. Shes being hunted by different factions of men in black leather and gray wool. Is there another kind of Angelina Jolie movie? This is the sort in which she has something or is someone of great interest to a lot of people. Why does this woman constantly require question marks and interrogation sequences?If we accept that Jolie is a movie star -- and she is -- then we should understand that an elusive element comes with the job. Having her play women of such bureaucratic mystery is a diminishment of her stardom not to a mention a redundancy like Arnold Schwarzenegger making movie after movie about the gym. Lady we get it Youre a tough nut to crack. What else have you got?""The Tourist at least gives Jolie a partner who can make her seem occasionally human. Depp is the first man shes worked with who doesnt have to resort to gunplay or domestic warfare in order to keep her attention. She seems unusually charmed by him. Jolie finds Depp on a train from France to Italy. Hes a Wisconsin math teacher (who looks like a Michigan meth dealer) and hes appropriately captivated. Shes using him as a decoy for her actual paramour an international thief whos nabbed hundreds of millions in British pounds. They have dinner they share a hotel room though never a bed (Jolie is to be looked at not touched) and a halfhearted ballroom dance.They also share some decent dialogue the sharpness of which harkens back to romantic capers like ""The Lady Eve and ""Charade. But the German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck cant keep that up for longer than a few minutes before falling back on limp foot-chases and the most exasperating score. I dont know who performed it but my guess is the Techno-Thriller Euro Disco Computer Blip Symphony.Donnersmarck won the foreign-language Oscar in 2007 for ""The Lives of Others his drama about life under the German Stasi. He won lots of other awards and presumably could have made any film he wanted. One hopes this is a clearing of the throat and not the start of a slump. He wrote ""The Tourist and shares credit with Christopher McQuarrie who wrote ""The Usual Suspects and Julian Fellows who wrote Robert Altmans murder-mystery ""Gosford Park. You can imagine what each man contributed to the finished product -- the pitiful plot twist for example is very Keyser Soze -- but at no point do they appear to be working on the same page. Tony Gilroys ""Duplicity with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen managed to pull off a similar version of this with great confidence and a lighter touch.The good news is that Jolie and Depp accessorize nicely together. He rarely gets to spar with women in his weight class and his slovenly approach to stardom might be the antidote for Jolies solemnity. Once or twice he manages to win a confused or amused look. Thats breaking character for her. Maybe a few more movies together and hell shatter it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris.

Think Grace Kelly. Think Audrey Hepburn.And then if youre thinking about The Tourist with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie (who were perhaps thinking about Cary Grant Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn) well think about adding To Catch a Thief or Charade to your Netflix queue instead.An alarmingly charmless attempt to evoke the elegant romance and jaunty jet-setting intrigue of the aforementioned titles The Tourist is notable for the total absence of movie-star heat that movie stars are paid unseemly sums to radiate.From its opening shots of a dressed-to-kill Jolie sashaying down a Paris rue on her way to morning tea The Tourist feels amiss. We soon discover that shes a woman named Elise and that a posse of international coppers are watching her every move (and debating whether shes wearing underwear or not). If Trey Parker and Matt Stone want to make another marionette genre parody - the South Park duos all-puppet Team America World Police took aim at action pics - they could cast Jolie as their lead. In her heels and wraps and sculpted dos she bobs with the slightly awkward air of a doll on strings. Grace(less) Kelly.Of course Elise is British which makes her even classier. And which makes the community college math teacher she picks up on the Paris-Venice bullet train look even more like a Midwestern bumpkin. He is Frank Tupelo. He reads spy novels. He is on vacation. And he is played with scruffy beard and pasty complexion by Mr. Depp.Its no puzzle why Elise has sidled up to Professor Tupelo. Its literally spelled out for us (with very tidy penmanship) in a letter delivered to her cafe table She needs to cozy up to a sucker that the spyware guys will think is her on-the-lam beau an international criminal who has embezzled millions.Scotland Yard Interpol some Russian thugs - theyre all after this mystery man. Frank is the clueless decoy.The Tourist is the first Hollywood film from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who won an Oscar for his East German police-state drama The Lives of Others. But apart from the stakeout scenes and the bugging scenes and the cops with their coffee cups watching wistfully as their subjects hob and nob and wine and dine the two films could have been made by different people. On different planets. The Lives of Others was a profoundly moving (and chilling) study of longing - for political artistic and spiritual freedom. The Tourist is a profoundly pointless and pace-challenged exercise in escapism with a script that aims for sophistication and wit and settles for exposition and witlessness.Depp delivers one or two dry bon mots but theyre addressed to a Venice police detective (Christian De Sica) not to his leading lady. And the pajamas Depp can be seen wearing during a rooftop chase while awfully cute unfortunately help to endorse the notion that the actor has been sleepwalking through his entire performance.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"The Tourist Depp Jolie travel to a place called mediocrity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Tourist Depp Jolie travel to a place called mediocrityIf youre content with watching Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie get chased in Paris and Venice then The Tourist lives up to low expectations.Depp and Jolie Good makeup poor chemistry.  (AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 9 2010 As a thriller The Tourist makes a good travelogue. Its as awkward as an unfolded map and as infuriating as a border bureaucrat. If youre content with watching the beautiful Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie get chased along the cobblestones of Paris and the canals of Venice then it fulfills those low eye-candy expectations. The makeup is impeccable; the scenery is pleasing. In cinematic terms its North by Northwest without the mystery and Charade without the personal chemistry. Which is a disappointment and also somewhat of a shock given the personnel involved. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck made The Lives of Others one of the most thoughtful and unsettling thrillers of the past decade. He co-wrote The Tourist screenplay adapting it from a French film along with two fine writers Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) and Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park Young Victoria). Why are they now settling for pretty pictures and mediocrity? Youd also expect more combustion between Jolie and Depp. Instead they strike poses she dresses and walks like shes on a fashion runaway; he runs around in his pajamas as if hes in a Buster Keaton movie. Jolie is British mystery woman Elise Ward who is up to something. Shes wanted by Scotland Yard and Interpol who watch her every move through secret cameras. Depp is Wisconsin math teacher Frank Tupelo the tourist of the title. Frank is up to nothing and hes wanted by nobody -- until he gets mixed up with Elise. Frank is mistaken for Alexander Pearce a larcenous banker who has stolen 2.3 billion from a vengeful gangster (Steven Berkoff). Wait a second whos the real crook here? Nobody actually knows what Pearce looks like including the Scotland Yard sleuth (Paul Bettany) who has been tracking him and Elise for the past year. Even Elise doesnt seem to have a clue and shes Pearces ex-lover. The reason proffered for this is frankly ridiculous. There is banter none of it memorable Elise scolds like a shrew and Frank mostly just takes it. Depp amuses by constantly using Spanish words instead of Italian ones and offering ""Bon Jovi"" for buon giorno but its small consolation. There are the requisite action set pieces where faceless stooges shoot badly at Depp and Jolie while our heroes scamper across rooftops ride the rails and zip along canals. Here Depp once again mildly amuses at one point leading a lukewarm pursuit whilst in his jammies. The script is the main beef. Its possibly the years laziest and most implausible thriller scenario and thats saying something in an annus horribilis that also includes the likes of Knight and Day and Killers. Reports of multiple director and cast changes might be the reason. The Tourist really lives up to its name though. It looks for all the world as if everybody just felt like going on a fun trip to Europe and couldnt be bothered with all the donkey work of making a movie that actually made sense or offered any real thrills. A fine time was had by all except the sorry viewer. The Tourist (out of 4) Starring Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie and Paul Bettany. Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.

Share Tweet Florian Henckel von Donnersmarcks The Lives Of Others was a lot of things extraordinarily well-plotted and acted; a quiet thriller played at the highest of stakes; a chilling record of the fear and paranoia that gripped East Germany under the Stasi. What it was not however was a particularly dazzling piece of filmmaking which makes von Donnersmarck precisely the wrong guy to direct The Tourist a cosmopolitan trifle along the lines of Charade or Alfred Hitchcocks To Catch A Thief. Pulling off a movie like this requires a director with the style to complement the glamorous stars snappy dialogue and ravishing travel-book images of European locales. (2009s underrated Duplicity is a sterling modern-day example.) But von Donnersmarcks meat-and-potatoes direction makes The Tourist astonishingly lifeless and awkward reducing two of the worlds biggest movie stars to something akin to shy pimply teenagers on their first date. Scripted by von Donnersmarck and two ringers Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) and Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) The Tourist advances a classic Hitchcock ""wrong man"" premise. Angelina Jolie plays a lovely mysterious woman whose boyfriend has stolen hundreds of millions from a gangster. Summoned to Venice for a rendezvous with the thief Jolie tries to shake the Interpol officers and thick-necked mobsters on her tail by taking up with a stranger who resembles her boyfriend. Of course that stranger a Wisconsin schoolteacher played by Johnny Depp happens to fall in love with Jolie just as some very dangerous characters mistake him for another man. And so begins a frothy thriller at half-pace with a sluggish rooftop chase scene to make no one forget The Bourne Ultimatum and the expected speed-boating through the Venetian canals which here seem only a hair faster than the gondolas. The script occasionally supplies some tart one-liners for Depp or Jolie but the chemistry isnt there mainly because Jolie is treated as more as sleek object than human and Depp looks plainly disengaged--when he announces that he loves her were just as surprised as she is. No one seems to be having any fun in The Tourist and theyre all stuck going through the motions.

Quite a lot actually. Johnny Depp Angelina Jolie Venice -- what more could you want from a movie? Quite a lot actually judging by ""The Tourist"" an all-too-resistible Euro-chic trifle that marks an undistinguished Hollywood debut for German talent Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Like a beautifully tailored suit that starts to smell funny after a few minutes this sumptuous but stultifying lark sets up a quasi-Hitchcockian intrigue between two strangers abroad but smothers any thrills or sparks in a haze of self-regard. The considerable eye candy of its stars and locations aside Sony release may not rack up much B.O. mileage domestically though international prospects look healthy. Admittedly there was little reason to expect von Donnersmarck to spin this work-for-hire into a sophomore outing as accomplished as his knockout 2006 writing-directing debut ""The Lives of Others."" And he scarcely deserves all the blame for a production whose creative team has seen more revolving doors than Venices famous Hotel Danieli (shown to nice effect here). A remake of 2005s little-seen French thriller ""Anthony Zimmer"" the film was conceived as a vehicle for Charlize Theron and Tom Cruise (who was briefly replaced by Sam Worthington) just as von Donnersmarck was preceded by Bharat Nalluri in the directors chair. Factor in a much-rewritten screenplay (Julian Fellowes Christopher McQuarrie and the helmer receive onscreen credit) and one almost begins to admire the final product for at least achieving a state of marginal coherence. One morning in Paris (France were helpfully informed) the exquisite Elise Ward (Jolie) strolls down to her favorite cafe and receives a letter from her lover Alexander Pearce whom we eventually learn is an elusive high-class thief wanted for stealing 744 million. Her actions are closely monitored by a team of Scotland Yard detectives led by Inspector Acheson (Paul Bettany high-strung) whose determination to collar Pearce borders on obsession. Following Pearces exact instructions Elise hops a Venice-bound train where she subtly puts the moves on Frank Tupelo (Depp) a random slightly rumpled American traveler whose provenance (""a math teacher from Wisconsin"") is the scripts idea of a joke worth repeating. Employing an arsenal of suggestive glances and coy one-liners Elise contrives to throw the cops off the scent by making them think Frank is Pearce. Something feels amiss with this wrong-man setup from the get-go. With his longish hair signature goatee and vaguely European bearing Depp is precisely no ones idea of an American average Joe and the choice immediately raises eyebrows as well as questions about the films intentions As Elise verbally seduces Frank the Yank in a first-class dining car are we watching a luxuriant transcontinental thriller or a sly self-aware comic exercise? Are Depp and Jolie trying to channel Cary Grant and Eva Marie-Saint in ""North by Northwest"" or is something weirder and more inscrutable afoot? No answers are immediately forthcoming and the films pulse quickens only modestly once the two arrive in Venice where Elise is torn between her devotion to the unseen Pearce and her sudden unaccountable feelings for Frank. Complicating matters further is the arrival of an English crime boss (Steven Berkoff enlivening the proceedings with real menace) on Pearces trail initiating a series of unexciting chases -- sometimes by boat sometimes over rooftops -- in which Elise and Frank keep alternating between rescuer and rescued their identities a continual matter of suspicion for the other characters and the audience. Presumably viewers are meant to find all this mystery thrillingly romantic and by dint of its setting alone ""The Tourist"" is not without a certain elegance. As he demonstrated in ""The Lives of Others"" von Donnersmarck is a classicist with a clean unfussy visual style and a refreshing aversion to the frenetic editing schemes so in vogue among contempo action-thrillers; he also tends to lean too heavily on music (an alternately jittery and swoony concoction by James Newton Howard). As for Venice the worlds most improbably gorgeous city has rarely looked better on film lensed in sweeping overhead shots that accentuate its sun-drenched beauty as opposed to its after-dark decay. Nor should one disregard the pleasures of watching two glamorous actors in motion whether its Jolie entering a ballroom coiffed like Sophia Loren or Depp riffing on his own debonair persona. But what lingers long after ""The Tourist"" has faded is the sense that amid all the rehashes and behind-the-scenes musical chairs someone decided that Jolie and Depps combined star wattage not to be confused with actual romantic chemistry would be enough -- not only to carry the script through its shopworn duplicitous doings but to make audiences care in the first place.

Take the Oscar-winning director of the universally acclaimed The Lives of Others and add not one but two Oscar-winning screenwriters - Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) and Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects). Throw in Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp attractive locations in wintry Paris and Venice. Sounds like it can hardly miss right? Well The Tourist is remarkable because its not inconsiderable talent pool has delivered a would-be light-hearted international crime caper which runs the gamut from idiocy to tedium and back again all the while exuding a smug sense of self-satisfaction which is frankly inexplicable. Long for the days of red London buses Shirley MacLaine in oriental eye make-up swishy dissolves and cocktail-hour music? Well stick with the 60s celluloid fluff of your choice because it certainly doesnt get any better here. Angelina Jolie is our glamorous female lead inexplicably cast as the English other half to a fugitive embezzler whos being eagerly sought by British police for diddling the UK taxman and indeed a heavy-duty gangster (Steven Berkoff - yawn) hes also left grillions out of pocket. This latterday pimpernel manages to get a message to his beloved in Paris to board a train to Venice and befriend a stranger she can pass off as him to put the pursuers off the scent - enter tousle-haired fake-ciggie-puffing Johnny Depp as the worlds least likely suburban maths teacher. Before long hes sharing an exclusive hotel room with this enigmatic seductress the prelude to being chased across the Venetian rooftops by Russian-accented thugs and so forth. And in the midst of this do we detect a frisson of romance....? Possibly but that would necessitate emerging from a coma first. The movies clearly intended as an insouciant diversion but von Donnersmarcks direction paces every single scene with the earnest deliberation of a learner articulated-lorry driver executing an especially tricky three-point turn. Steady...steady...steady. Some felicities of performance or dialogue might enliven the torpor but theres a dearth of snappy one-liners Depp underplays to the degree you feel you must be watching the rehearsal takes and Jolie pus so much concentration into maintaining her strangled Julie Andrews accent that shes obviously no energy to invest this mystery lady with any emotional life. Theres barely a flicker of chemistry between the two stars which renders everything else increasingly academic especially when the presumed action highlights fall flat (tip if you want to see a proper boat chase check out 1971s Amsterdam-set potboiler Puppet on a Chain) and Paul Bettanys struggles to do anything with a thankless Basil Exposition part as the man from Scotland Yard are poignant to behold. Top this off with a twist ending which is unpredictable in that its so ludicrous the film-makers are effectively treating the audience like cretins and you have a movie that falls down on every level.Yes its dreck but weve all seen duff movies. What makes this so painfully exasperating is that The Tourist is so bloody pleased with itself. Its as if were supposed to be pitifully grateful just to see La Jolie in a slinky dress or peek inside Venices swanky Hotel Danieli or thrill to the devastatingly clever plot developments the film-makers have in store for us. Perhaps their ideal viewer is some unfortunate whos spent a life in seclusion exposed only to endless reruns of Hart to Hart and Remington Steele. If that sounds like you you might possibly be entertained by this. Just dont expect too much.

Now because it was released in 2010 that makes it the worst film of last year and this year (so far)...

Lame plot terrible acting wasted location I couldnt stay awake. I shouldve been alerted to its crapness by the appearances of Steven Berkoff amp; Rufus Sewell... They love being in crap films....

The Tourist (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Tourist (PG-13) Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie fizzle in this lame thriller Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald12/8/2010 Editor rating 1 The Tourist conclusively proves that Angelina Jolie is one of the most beautiful women ever to have walked the planet but although you can stare at her face forever that alone does not a movie make. She plays the enigmatic Elise who lives in Paris and is being shadowed by a Scotland Yard detective (Paul Bettany) who is waiting for her to lead him to her elusive lover who is wanted for stealing millions of dollars. For more than half of the movie The Tourist which eventually switches locale to Venice Elise remains a riddle her elegant demeanor and pleasant smile obviously harboring a secret. In his English-language debut German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (who previously made the astonishing The Lives of Others) photographs Jolie better than any previous filmmaker -- you cant help but wonder what Hitchcock whose creativity was often fueled by his leading ladies would have done with her -- and her looks are even incorporated into the story. When she walks down the aisle of a commuter train every man who gazes up does a double-take. One of the passengers an American vacationer named Frank (Johnny Depp) catches her attention. He is smitten; she leads him on then suddenly dumps him and disappears. The plot of The Tourist written by von Donnersmarck the esteemed Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) and Julian Fellowes (Gosford Park) has a couple of major twists one of them so far-fetched and ridiculous you have to see it for yourself to believe it. Wait on second thought its better you just take my word for it. The backdrop of stunning locations plush hotels and fancy five-star restaurants endows it with a vague To Catch a Thief panachel. But the film suffers from a severe lack of urgency and emotional engagement. You cant get involved in a movie in which the characters all seem to be harboring double identities. Depp seems utterly bored to the bone -- rarely has a man in mad love seemed so blase -- and he and Jolie dont fit well as a couple. You keep waiting for her to ask him when hes going to get a haircut and buy some new clothes. The supporting characters such as Bettanys driven detective are lifted whole from Screenwriting Cliche 101 and even the villains like a jealous mobster who murdered every man his wife ever slept with before they got married are cartoons. The Tourist gets sillier as the plot crawls along its pace so slow that the movie could well put Ambien out of business once it starts showing up on late-night cable TV. But Jolie emerges unscathed from this stylish folly Watching her work her way through a black-tie crowd in an evening dress and a diamond necklace provides the sort of glamorous entertainment the rest of The Tourist should have - but cannot - muster.

"Thrills are few in the laid-back Tourist - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Thrills are few in the laid-back TouristDepp Jolie cant raise this sleepy confusing flick a 2 starsDecember 09 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAngelina Jolie left and Johnny Depp star in ""The Tourist."" (Columbia Pictures/MCT)""The Tourist"" is a facsimile of a masquerade of a gloss on ""Charade"" and on all the lesser cinematic charades that followed in the wake of director Stanley Donens 1963 picture. While its fairly easy to take in its retro way -- it certainly takes it easy on the audience -- its a peculiar sort of ... leisure thriller I suppose is the phrase. When the Johnny Depp character scurries against a green screen in his jammies along tiled Venice rooftops fleeing Russian mobsters the question arises Is it still ""fleeing"" if the actors stunt double isnt moving very quickly?Based on the little-seen French film ""Anthony Zimmer"" (2005) ""The Tourist"" offers four deluxe cinematic locales Paris Venice Depp and Angelina Jolie. For this assignment director and co-writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck best known for ""The Lives of Others"" has no interest in politics or real life or even the planet Earth. He and his colleagues are making a serenely ludicrous Continental fairy tale.Depp plays the wrong man in this wrong-man scenario a midwestern shmo picked up by Jolies character Elise on a train from Paris to Venice. Elise a Brit is the paramour of a man who stole billions belonging to a London gangster (Steven Berkoff). Shes instructed by her shadow lover who doesnt appear on screen until late in the game to find a false boyfriend on the train in order to throw the INTERPOL agents off the scent or divert their attention. Something. Couldnt say for sure actually. Before the screening I saw the ""Tourist"" trailer three times and still couldnt make out the premise. Good thing Venice photographs well.Depps character is supposed to be a Wisconsin community college math instructor yet the way he comports himself in ""The Tourist"" even before the fancy-dress party scenes he suggests an amalgam of everybody Carly Simon may have sung about in ""Youre So Vain."" Alarmingly skinny by Euro standards and even American ones Jolies Elise nonetheless turns one head after another with comical reliability. In Venice where the angry mobsters and the Scotland Yard detectives played by Paul Bettany and Timothy Dalton close in there are canal chases of middling interest and an almost aggressive lack of razzle-dazzle. Depp barely raises his voice above whisper level throughout ""The Tourist"" even when his lifes in danger.American audiences I suspect may have trouble warming to the film since they tend to resist movies with any mentions of INTERPOL (why is that?) just as they resist twisty affairs with a predominantly facetious tone (such as ""Duplicity"" the one with Clive Owen and Julia Roberts). Coming after ""Salt"" Jolies previous and harder-charging diversion ""The Tourist"" plays like a quaint artifact from a lost world. It goes down or sideways like a cup of caffeine-free mint tea -- a thriller for those who prefer to keep their vital signs nice and steady.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence and brief strong language)Cast Angelina Jolie (Elise); Johnny Depp (Frank); Paul Bettany (Acheson); Timothy Dalton (Jones); Steven Berkoff (Shaw); Rufus Sewell (The Englishman)Credits Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck; written by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck Christopher McQuarrie and Julian Fellowes based on the French film ""Anthony Zimmer""; produced by Graham King Tim Headington Roger Birnbaum Gary Barber and Jonathan Glickman.

TWITTER Whats served under a label promising first-class champagne tastes like last nights prosecco in ""The Tourist."" Whats served under a label promising first-class champagne tastes like last nights prosecco in The Tourist. Staggeringly misjudged in virtually every department from the wannabe effervescent script to Johnny Depps dopey hairdo this zero-chemistry pairing of Angelina Jolie and Depp stands as an object lesson in the perils of succumbing to the siren call of big-time Hollywood filmmaking for a foreign director with one art house hit behind him. The publicity machine will work overtime to drum up some initial business but this Sony release promises to drown in a bog of its own making. After receiving near-universal acclaim and a foreign-language film Oscar for his 2006 debut feature The Lives of Others a quietly riveting suspense drama set in East Germany Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who grew up partially in the U.S. and speaks perfect English was inundated with offers from all quarters but wanted to choose carefully. After such a long delay for him to have finally settled on this trifling romp over the rooftops and in the canals of Venice is stupefying to say the least and will give plenty of ammunition to the small band of detractors of his earlier outing. GALLERY Jolies Tourist style. Embalmed in makeup and elegant gowns that puts one in mind of Loretta Young and employing a reserved English accent that allows no possibility of genuine emotional expression Jolie plays Elise the object of many mens attention in the opening scenes which is no surprise even though the men in question are all surveillance experts intent upon following her every move in the hope shell lead them to her criminal lover one Alexander Pearce. After she receives a note instructing her to take a morning train from Paris to Venice the chase is on and she knows it. With every guy on board keen for Elise to sit next to them she instead gloms on to the scruffy rather forlorn-looking Frank Tupelo a mild-mannered math teacher from Wisconsin. Baffled and unnerved by her attentions Frank is thoroughly unequipped to partake in the kind of witty insinuating dialogue expected in stories of train-bound intrigue. Not that Donnersmarck having revamped previous scripts by the estimable Julian Fellowes and Christopher McQuarrie has written any. But its woefully clear from their first scene together that not only is there nothing clicking between the stars but that the entire enterprise is madly artificial and silly that whatever games are being played here are not going to be fun. RELATED Tourist tracking softly. Donnersmarck along with his multitude of producers must have dreamed that with two of the most glamorous and best-looking stars in the business he had a shot of making a modern Hitchcock romantic thriller along the lines of The 39 Steps To Catch a Thief and North by Northwest. Well dream on. No one here evinces the slightest feel for that sort of sly sophistication. Instead we get tiresome scenes of the hapless Frank whos presumed to be the much sought-after Alexander being pursued by goons of a Scotland Yard contingent led by Paul Bettany and by those of a gangster tycoon (Steven Berkoff) from whom Alexander stole a fortune and who youd believe to be Russian but for his British accent. Least accountable of all is the growing affection Elise seems to be feeling for the ineffectual Frank. Or is she pretending? One minute she invites him into her sumptuous suite at the Danieli the next she makes him sleep on the couch. After telling him to go home and dropping him at the airport she then dances with him at an elegant ball. But no matter as the film manages to build nary a trace of interest in either character. Looking puffy and unassertive Depp never has registered less effectively in his entire film career. For Jolies part the nature of her role doesnt allow her to show her hand to anyone severely limiting the extent of characterization. This is where wit and lively banter would come in handy but this is more difficult to appropriate from old movies than is format. Surely Donnersmarck did not set out to remake Death in Venice but artistically that is what has been achieved.

The Tourist starring Angelina Jolie as a hip-swiveling British agent fatale and Johnny Depp as the innocent American math teacher she ropes into posing as her underworld lover is an attempt to take the stuffing out of the genre. Most of the familiar elements are here guns gangsters surveillance teams vehicular crack-ups mistaken identities. The star wattage in theory could hardly get much hotter. This time however the director is Germanys Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck doing his first Hollywood production after the art-house smash The Lives of Others (2007) his lacerating tale of political oppression in East Germany. Henckel von Donnersmarck sets The Tourist in the ornate decaying maze of Venice where he plays down the ultraviolence and mission-improbable stunt work. When Depp pursued by the worlds most inept Russian henchmen scampers across the citys fragile tiled rooftops hes wearing pajamas and the little leaps he takes are (intentionally) more pedestrian than death-defying. The Tourist has a relaxed at times ramblingly archaic tone (were not talking Hitchcock -- were talking Silver Streak). It sidesteps the aggressive wham-bam tone of cheeky-violent romps from The Mexican to Knight and Day. Unfortunately it doesnt come up with a whole lot to replace that energy. Its American cheese with Euro glaze. You go into a movie like The Tourist hoping for a feast of personality from the stars. What you get in this case is a waxworks version of chemistry. As Elise who is being chased by everyone in the movie because theyre out to capture her lover the slinky saucy Jolie turns every scene into a playful series of poses. After a while though you wish shed stop posing. Shes a great image but in The Tourist she never seems to be a real person. Depp in longish curls and a beard that make it look like hes starring in a bad Christopher Columbus biopic plays the sweet hapless Frank as a corduroy-jacketed dullard. Its as if after so many flamboyant portrayals the actor was out to challenge himself by going minimal -- by creating a romantic hero as ""ordinary"" as possible. But did the script reportedly worked over forever by Henckel von Donnersmarck Julian Fellowes and Christopher McQuarrie have to be so minimal too? ""So thats how you pick a lock"" observes Frank after Elise frees him from handcuffs. ""Why do you know how to do that?"" Thats about as roused as he gets. If Frank were a truly colorful putz the portrayal might have gone somewhere but Depp for too much of the movie seems to be amusing himself in a way that only dogs can hear. The Tourist isnt a debacle but its a caper thats fatally low on carbonation. Its clear that Henckel von Donnersmarck adores his films popcorn tropes for the cliches they are. Hes not out to transcend the tropes -- he wants to get out of their way. But a filmmaker as gifted as he is should figure out soon that theres a big difference in Hollywood between playing to crowds and pleasing them.
