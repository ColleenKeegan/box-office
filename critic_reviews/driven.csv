Almost invariably they fall into the same predictable pattern of pretty people moving from one track to another drivers competing with each other in cars by day and over available young women after hours with the constant spectre of sudden injury or death looming over all concerned. ""Driven"" a souped-up big-canvas actioner with a notably cheesy look to it reps the latest manifestation of the genres apparent built-in limitations. B.O. for pics set in this milieu is normally reliable but unspectacular a pattern that should continue with this Warner Bros. release. There seems to be no escaping the inherent cliches of auto racing pictures. Almost invariably they fall into the same predictable pattern of pretty people moving from one track to another drivers competing with each other in cars by day and over available young women after hours with the constant spectre of sudden injury or death looming over all concerned. ""Driven"" a souped-up big-canvas actioner with a notably cheesy look to it reps the latest manifestation of the genres apparent built-in limitations. B.O. for pics set in this milieu is normally reliable but unspectacular a pattern that should continue with this Warner Bros. release. Written by Sylvester Stallone with a decided lack of ego and insistence upon centrality where his own character is concerned ""Driven"" flits around the globe by private plane as it delineates a Championship Auto Racing Team season dominated by German world champion Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger) and Yank circuit rookie Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue). Natch these two handsome blonds are in a tussle over another blond beauty Sophia (Estella Warren) who runs off with Jimmy after Beau decides he needs to concentrate exclusively on his driving. This triangle which fills the requirements for some youthful internationally flavored eye candy is surrounded by an assortment of nearly-as-attractive and equally one-dimensional characters with heavy agendas of their own Stallones Joe Tanto is a former racer brought back to help the immature Jimmy by tough guy team owner Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) once a driver himself but now confined to a wheelchair; Joes tart-tongued ex-wife Cathy (Gina Gershon) turns up as the new wife of another of Carls drivers sexy Latin Memo Heguy (Chilean thesp Cristian de la Fuente); Lucretia Clan (Stacy Edwards) a comely journalist whose total access to racing participants seems to extend further with Joe; and DeMille Bly (Robert Sean Leonard) Jimmys cutthroat brother and manager. As the action (documented in peripatetic second unit work thats effectively joined to Canadian main unit locationing) moves from Long Beach to Toronto Miami Tokyo Chicago Sydney Rio Detroit and Germany Jimmy who initially delights in snaring Sophia the moment Beau drops her goes into a spin with one wrong turn after another. Slipping behind Beau in the rankings he cant hold on to his new girlfriend bottoms out by furiously tearing through the streets of Chicago in his race car at 195 mph closely pursued by Joe in his then infuriates Carl by performing the humanitarian deed of quitting a big race to rescue team partner Memo from certain death. Abandoned by his boss and even by his brother the callow youth must rise to the occasion to prove his worthiness as a man and a professional with predictable results. With all sorts of new technology from mini helmet cameras to digital effects at his disposal director Renny Harlin has unfortunately adopted a lets-try-anything attitude that translates into a chaotic and unattractive visual style. Employing casual-looking set-ups and overcutting like crazy Harlins approach is much more mannered and uncertain than it was on ""Die Hard 2"" and ""Cliffhanger"" nearly a decade ago. Nor are matters helped by a few poor CGI-style shots notably an idiotic one that follows an errant tires trajectory off its axle far up into the air and then down into the stands and in hilariously gratuitous material that one can imagine co-producer Elie Samaha did not discourage endless babe atmospherics of suggestively clad sexy chicks lovingly consuming hot dogs or cinnamon sticks. The races themselves are shot with a considerable degree of variety and verisimilitude but their effectiveness is undercut by the lack of sustained visual p.o.v. and the dramatic participation of only two serious and well-identified competitors for nearly all the races. A couple of times Stallones Joe is allowed to get back into action but only to run interference for Jimmy not to plausibly compete for the checkered flag. Yet another downside is provided by the blaring and grating score by BT the current chosen credit of electronic musician Brian Transeau. Given the jolting decibel levels of racing itself a composer could choose to either shout over the noise or undercut it with a cooler but still exciting techno sound; unfortunately BT went the former route to numbing effect. Thesps are mostly OK given the constraints of their roles. Stallone is agreeably relaxed as a mentor figure who doesnt need to show off or always be the center of attention. As a fierce competitor constrained by his limited physical mobility Reynolds gets to utter some of the scripts most dramatic lines but the thesps fine new toupee probably his best ever is offset by the unfortunate new look of his eyes which now appear slanted. Major German star Schweiger cuts an entirely convincing figure as a successful Euro racer Pardue lays the constipation on a bit heavily as the lucky freshman and Warren swims beautifully as This Years Model whose acting abilities may be tested at a later date. Edwards role as the journo seems so truncated that its never clear whether she ends up in the sack with Joe or not. DrivenProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Franchise Pictures presentation.

This is PlayStation cinema popcorn porn crammed with so many ludicrous/breathtaking SFX sequences that you almost forget the comic storyline cartoon characters and crass leaps in plot logic. It also takes liberties with motor racing which even non-believers might consider diabolical.

Publicity Photo ""Driven"" directed by Renny Harlin is set on the Championship Auto Racing Team circuit. Publicity Photo Image 2 of 2 Sylvester Stallone center plays an over-the-hill race-car driver in ""Driven."" Publicity Photo Sylvester Stallone center plays an over-the-hill race-car driver in ""Driven."" Publicity Photo Unruly Driven is all about the car crashes 1 / 2 Back to Gallery DRIVEN Action. Written by and starring Sylvester Stallone. Directed by Renny Harlin. (PG-13. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Sylvester Stallone lugs his own story around with him like a rock he keeps pushing up the mountain. Stallone wrote and appears in ""Driven"" a comeback story of an over-the- hill race-car driver who hitches his star to a young hotshot. It follows last years disastrous ""Get Carter"" remake which incredibly changed one of the all-time great downbeat film noir endings for no other reason apparently than to suit Stallones image. ""Driven"" is all over the map in more ways than one. Stallone may be the name but he is not the protagonist. In a series of Championship Auto Racing Team/Indy events from Chicago to Japan he plays a former ace with the typically iconic moniker Joe Tanto who is recruited to keep an unruly rookie driver on track. The rookies name is Bly (rhymes with Sly). The focus is scattered among four drivers and their women. One of the remaining two drivers is Blys rival both for the championship and for the love of a racing groupie. Then there is a vain showboat married to Tantos ex- wife. Got all that straight? It doesnt make any difference. The real emotion in action director Renny Harlins movie is in the crashes crunchingly conceived and digitally brought off. ""Driven"" is going to drive some folks to distraction but it doesnt matter. Stallone doesnt rev their engines in the first place and they wouldnt go see ""Driven"" anyway. For all his upbeat sermonizing Stallone at 54 is still a shrewd old dog. Even if his own star may be fading the popularity of car racing is enormous. These fans are not likely to be disappointed by ""Driven."" The racing action at tracks throughout the world and on one memorable occasion the streets of Chicago is what counts. Buzzing and zipping cars scrape flip and slam into walls. In the Chicago joyride they squeeze under truck rigs in a blaze of sparks. One race car breaks apart in midair after a crackup and the pieces slowly separate and fall. In a German race during a rainstorm a car flies through the air in slow motion as others continue to zip past in a high-speed blur. The vehicle keeps flying into a pond setting fire to trees on the way down. The burning trees crash into the water now covered with fuel and it ignites. The wreckage then explodes. Whew Elsewhere Harlins directing sometimes turns into a cascade of quick cuts swooping jerking and glomming onto ultra-close-ups in a substitute for genuine excitement. Out of this emerge fragments of stories. Bly the rookie is played by baby-faced Kip Pardue (""Remember the Titans""). German actor Til Schweiger is his rival Beau Brandenburg and Chilean leading man Cristian de la Fuente is the vain Memo Moreno -- he was just named one of the ""50 Most Beautiful"" people by People magazine so I guess hes entitled. One of them will eventually emerge as the champion but by that time the audience is unlikely to share the onscreen enthusiasm. Stallone has been guiding on track in another car bad boy Blys progress. But his principal and self-assigned task -- he wrote this after all -- is to give the young hothead an inspirational goose at regular intervals. ""Faith is like having a good disease"" Tanto says at one point. ""People are going to catch it."" Gina Gershon plays Tantos ex-wife now married to the Chilean glamour boy. Gershon is so out there that she enlivens even brief scenes such as a bitchy encounter in a ladies room. Estella Warren is the young blonde who bounces between Bly and Brandenburg and only time will tell whether her Angelina Jolie lips will help or hinder her career. They help here. Burt Reynolds shows up in a wheelchair -- as a reminder of the hazards of the profession? -- as the race-car owner and professional SOB who brings Tanto out of retirement. Stallones love interest such as it is is provided by Stacy Edwards hovering in the background as a newspaper reporter assigned to expose ""male dominance in the sport"" of race-car driving. Huh? The subject is never mentioned again. Advisory Contains graphic race-car crashes.

USATODAY.com - Driven is Slys latest speed bump Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/30/2001 - Updated 1202 PM ET Driven is Slys latest speed bump By Mike Clark USA TODAY Driven (out of four) Stars Sylvester Stallone Burt Reynolds Kip Pardue Stacy Edwards Til Schweiger Gina Gershon Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for language and intense crash sequences Even the wimpiest recalled Firestone has more tread than Driven a race-car drama full of flashy but empty images and a soundtrack that makes you feel as if youre being shaken on a motel rumblebed. Of course a rumblebed just charges you a few quarters not full-price movie admissions. Surrounded by pretty young faces -- and Burt Reynolds -- Sylvester Stallone continues his attempt to evolve into a wizened character actor. In an almost subsidiary role hes a has-been racer who threw his career away and is now mellow enough to help a novice (Kip Pardue) on a Championship Auto Racing Team. Read more Video Driven trailer The picture is stocked with the usual race-pic remnants fiery crashes musical beds and -- in a relatively recent addition to the genre -- several hundred shots of scantily clad female fans caught in busty profiles or eating hot dogs provocatively. The Pardue characters key rival -- both on the track and with a blonde (Estella Warren) -- is a German world champ (Til Schweiger) with some testy track history with Stallone. And speaking of testy Slys ex-wife (Gina Gershon tripping over her mascara) has it in for him too. Given the movies level of subtlety its a surprise the soundtrack isnt playing the Otis Redding-Carla Thomas recording of Tramp every time she appears. Team owner Reynolds (another ex-racer) gets one big-scene tirade but is otherwise relegated to barking into a headset during races. Looking slightly less boyish than usual Robert Sean Leonard plays Pardues brother in the stock smoothie/promoter role the kind of guy who seems to have come out of the womb wearing shades. Renny Harlins direction of this is so busy and unfocused that it almost seems to have a tic and neither he nor Stallones screenplay can decide where the story (will Pardue measure up?) should go. So heres another movie in which two guys wreak havoc by racing cars at 195 mph through city streets but get off with just a 25000 fine. (And this unlikely fact is mentioned only on a subsequent voice-over that sounds as if it were spliced in during postproduction.) Such contempt for the audience is incessant just like in the many films that long ago turned Reynolds -- and more recently his ironically cast co-star -- into the two most past-tense superstars of the last 25 years. With so much rich competition already its tough to handicap which release will win the Razzie award for worst movie of 2001. Were looking for a shoo-in like last years Battlefield Earth but Driven is certainly a condender. Lets just say that even the porn pics that Reynolds character directed in Boogie Nights probably had more substance.

(Warner Bros.) I guess I must be missing some kind of race-car gene. Unlike the millions of fans worldwide who thrill to the excitement of NASCAR CART and Formula One racing I find the whole idea of men in helmets and padded suits competing against one another to see who can drive the fastest . . . boring. Be that as it may with ""Driven"" an appallingly dull film set in the world of professional racing director Renny Harlin and screenwriter Sylvester Stallone have found a way to drain all the adrenaline out of the sport. How? For starters cast people who cant act. Heck actors Til Schweiger (what is he some kind of German luncheon meat?) and Cristian de la Fuente can barely speak English - but then again that never stopped co-star Stallone. Next pad out the racing scenes with cliches like an off-track love triangle between drivers Schweiger and Kip Pardue and pouty arm candy Estella Warren. Toss in a disgraced racing veteran (Stallone) and his attempt to redeem himself by mentoring a hot-headed rookie (Pardue) a crusty boss in a wheelchair (Burt Reynolds) and a bitter ex-wife (Gina Gershon looking like an ad for permanent lip-liner tattoos) and youve got movie magic. Dont forget to drown out the laughable dialogue with a turgid rock soundtrack and make sure to film the whole thing like a music video shot by a ""Cops"" camera crew on crystal meth. For good measure whenever possible cut to roaring crowd shots and closeups of women in halter tops and short shorts eating corn dogs foot-long wieners and crullers. Gentlemen start your engines indeed. ""Driven"" (PG-13 117 minutes) - Contains a couple of obscenities and many high-speed car crashes.

C+ Driven Genre Sports Drama Action/Adventure; Starring Kip Pardue Sylvester Stallone Cristian de la Fuente Stacy Edwards Gina Gershon Robert Sean Leonard Burt Reynolds Til Schweiger Estella Warren; Director Renny Harlin; Author Sylvester Stallone; Producer (group) The Canton Company Franchise Pictures Trackform Film Productions; Release Date Wide 04/27/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 120; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 4 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT The demon-speedster auto races in Driven have a jazzy fatalistic surge. The director Renny Harlin (Deep Blue Sea Cliffhanger) is a poor mans Tony Scott who has never to my knowledge put a convincing human relationship on screen but he showcases the hot wheelers that compete in an international Formula One-style championship from what looks like a dozen different angles at once. We get bolted-camera zoom-thrust views from the drivers seat but also panoramic visions from way up over the track and these Gods-eye images of the thrill of sheer velocity have the same nihilistic sizzle that the burned-rubber ground images do. The racing footage was shot all over the world much of it at actual competitions (in Toronto Chicago Australia) but wherever the tracks are we get the same rabid audiences of globalized sensation freaks the same souped-up machines zipping forward at speeds that approach 250 miles per hour in a way that makes their movements look supremely light so that the spectacle of their crack-up becomes as exciting as it is horrific. When one of the open-wheel racers smashes against a wall exploding into fragments that float upward like metallic soot it seems less a wipeout than a consummation -- a car merging with the air taking ""flight"" in its very disaster. The racing scenes in Driven borrow as much from the Mad Max trilogy as they do from popular car-race fables like Grand Prix or Days of Thunder. Thats a good thing too since the movie when it deigns to leave the track is the essence of revved-up kitsch complete with the awkward sight of Sylvester Stallone in one of his metaphor-for-my-latest-comeback roles attempting to swagger like an ageless megastar and take an honorable backseat to the younger players at the same time. Stallone also wrote the script and his dialogue is studded with hootable steroid pensees like ""Im not going down in flames with you brother -- thats one trip youre takin alone"" An actor by the name of Kip Pardue as the downy rookie Jimmy Bly is so unconvincing as a hotshot that he suggests the alterna-rocker Beck cast as a kamikaze bomber pilot and Til Schweiger as his European rival Beau Brandenburg may be even more humorless than Jean-Claude Van Damme. It would be hard to say too who tops whom in the angry overacting sweepstakes Gina Gershon as a martini-sloshing harpie with a curdled smile that practically drips off the side of her face or Burt Reynolds wearing so much makeup that he resembles a wax figure of Omar Sharif as an addled car-franchise owner in a wheelchair. Driven is mostly preposterous and it has no dramatic center but the racing scenes hold you in their death-trip grip.
