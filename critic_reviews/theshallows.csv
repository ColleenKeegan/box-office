The ship sank leaving the survivors of the explosion--some 900 men--to float helplessly in the Pacific. The crew sent SOS signals; help never came. What did come however were sharks specifically oceanic whitetips and the creatures proceeded to pick off the survivors one by one. The ordeal lasted for four days. Only 317 men would emerge alive from what remains ""the worst shark attack in history.""News of the horror that had befallen the crew of the Indianapolis contributed to a national anxiety that remains with us and that has been both channeled and exacerbated by pop culture. Deep Blue Sea Kon-Tiki Dinoshark Soul Surfer Sharknados 1-3 (with the fourth installment Sharknado 4 The 4th Awakens planned for release in late July) and the many many other films in the Jaws genre ... all of them summon the fear that sharks are not just predators but also--much more than other powerful animals manage to be--monsters. Call it if you want (though you probably shouldnt) fin-ema.The Shallows is another entry in that genre--a ""survival thriller"" about an epic battle of wits and wills that takes place between an American woman Nancy Adams (Blake Lively) and a vicious shark. Nancy is a medical student who is reconsidering her lifes purpose after losing her mother to a long battle with cancer; as a kind of tribute she travels to a deserted beach in Mexico--the same one her mother traveled to when she learned she was pregnant. She plans simply to surf the waters there as her mother had but instead she encounters a Great White--and it turns out will keep encountering it. She gets bitten on her thigh; she spends the many hours after the bite occurs battling not just the shark but also hunger and dehydration and gangrene and the suns rays. A little bit Jaws a little bit Blue Crush a little bit 127 Hours and a little bit Shark Week The Shallows would seem to be a promising fusion of all the things we love to hate and hate to love about saw-toothed cartilaginous fishes.Related Story Consider the Left Shark It is probably not a good sign that fairly soon into proceedings serious questions emerge about the sharks motivations. Hunger alone doesnt seem to be driving him (Ill refer to him as a ""him"" as Nancy does throughout the movie though the audience isnt privy to the biological sex of this modern-day megalodon). The ordeal begins with Nancy spotting a dead whale off the beach and paddling toward it in curiosity; since Great Whites in particular have been known to feast on whale carcasses and in fact likely derive a hefty portion of their total calories from whale blubber then The Shallows as far as the shark is concerned is set in the parking lot of a Hometown Buffet. The shark also has other human victims in addition to Nancy; one of them washes up on the beach deceased but uneaten--another suggestion that the shark is more than simply hungry.So then (and I belabor this point only because it is also the entire premise of this film) Is the shark territorial? Is the beach Nancy has been surfing his hunting ground? Which would make sense except that (according to the many gorgeous aerial shots the film provides of waters so crystalline as to reveal the particular typographies of the shallows floor) the beach in question seems to be home to precisely none of the animals that would normally be hunted by Great Whites. So then Maybe the shark has somehow realized on a spiritual level if not an intellectual one that humans are responsible for the decline of the global shark population and figures he should do his part to correct the imbalance? Or maybe he saw The Age of Adeline and is seeking his revenge?The film with images both lush and taut is a visual masterpiece--but the visuals are also part of its problem.The answer in the end seems to be at once more boring and more interesting than any of those This shark must simply be a sadist. He is like Jaws in Jaws--and when it comes to Nancy in particular for reasons that can be known to the shark alone this time its personal. And so The shark circles malevolently as orchestral strings swell. He waits with an impressive amount of patience for Nancy to be forced back into the water. He does what he can to knock her off her precarious perches an outcropping of rock the whale carcass a buoy. He is whatever Nancy does and however long she waits simply there. He isnt attacking her so much as he is stalking.The Shallows bills itself as a ""suspense thriller"" and suspenseful it certainly is. Its director Jaume Collet-Serra has taken the lessons of Jaws and made them his own He understands and employs to great effect the power of the sharks-eye-view of a human frolicking on the surface of the water and how the sound of a few taut orchestral strings can set a collection of human nerves on edge and the way Great Whites in particular--braun and brain united by millions of years worth of evolution--can summon humans deepest fears. Add to all that some lush masterful cinematography and a setting that might as well be a default screensaver of a Microsoft-circa-1999 desktop and you have a film that is all in all a visual masterpiece.The gorgeous visuals though are also part of its problem. The Shallows revels despite its survival-driven storyline in its various physical beauties--not just those of its setting but also those of its star. At the outset when The Shallows is more Blue Crush and less Soul Surfer we get several slow languorous almost-uncomfortably-close-up shots of Lively stripping down to her (tiny) bikini. And then rubbing sunscreen on her back slowly and languorously (even though moments later shell don a neoprene jacket that will render that effort completely unnecessary). And then zipping that jacket up just enough to tighten her cleavage but not to cover it. And then once in the water straddling her surfboard. Collet-Serra delights in angles that focus on the surface level of the water; what that amounts to when it comes to Lively however are a series of crotch shots.This is a movie of course about a lady-surfer; you would expect given that a certain amount of lady-surfer-in-her-bathing-suit images. Compounding things however is the fact that the images The Shallows serves up arent just remarkably sexualized. Theyre also remarkably violent. Before she takes a beating from the shark Nancy takes one from the ocean. She wipes out while surfing and the camera dutifully--but not at all necessarily--provides several close-up shots of her arms and legs getting pounded against rocks and of her hair (loose of course) tossed by currents in whiplash-y slo-mo. Even before the shark appeared the audience in my screening was audibly gasping at the violence displayed onscreen.In this theres an uncomfortable dissonance The film has empathy for Nancy at one moment and at the next suggests its own form of cinematic sadism. It carries messages about female empowerment until it doesnt. The Shallows takes a saw-toothed villain and uses that as an excuse for a maritime version of Saw; it is in the end torture porn that outsources its violence to the morally unaccountable realm of the natural world.Whatever Nancy does--however long she waits--the shark is there. He isnt attacking her so much as stalking her.Hampering things further is the fact that the plot moves along not just through the battle of wills taking place between a human and a fish but also through a series of improbable twists of bad luck--the result of cosmic accidents and also of people (and sharks obviously) being mired in self-absorption. There are approximately 13 separate moments of deus-ex-machina-in-reverse during the course of the 87-minute movie which suggest either that Nancy has exceptionally bad luck or that the films writer Tony Jaswinski is highly attuned to the zig-zagging nature of fate. ""Youve got to be kidding me"" Nancy mutters as yet another unforeseen and highly improbable obstacle is thrown in her path.When even the film itself acknowledges its own inconceivability there might be a problem. It would be one thing if The Shallows had been based like Soul Surfer on a true story and thus obligated to the solemnity of history; the various punishments Nancy faces though have been doled out by human imagination. That makes their absurdities not merely absurd but laughably so.Its unfortunate for everyone involved but especially for Lively who proves her star power in The Shallows--not to mention an acting range never on display in Gossip Girl or any of her other projects. She is subtle when she needs to be funny when she can be all the while evincing a quiet determination that perfectly suits the demands and the particular challenges of the story in question. And Nancy herself is an engaging protagonist (her version of Tom Hankss Wilson is a seagull who ends up stranded with her after it too is injured by the shark--a bird she ends up naming ""Steven Seagull""). The Shallows should be a star vehicle for Lively; it likely will be.But that doesnt make it good. The film could have been self-consciously campy in the manner of 1999s Deep Blue Sea which featured Saffron Burrows fighting bio-engineered sharks-gone-rogue and was a thorough delight. Instead The Shallows takes itself very very seriously--as a ""thriller""; as Cinema; as a tale of survival; as a moody take on the enduring themes of (Wo)man Versus Nature and the Power of the Sea; as a vaguely feminist tribute to feminine independence. (The song that plays during the closing credits is Sias ""Bird Set Free"" whose lyrics include the lines ""Im not gon care if I sing off key/ I find myself in my melodies/ I sing for love I sing for me/ I shout it out like a bird set free."") The Shallows was originally titled In the Deep and its revealing that the two names selected for the movie are so profoundly self-contradictory. This is a film that doesnt seem to know what exactly it is--or what exactly given the extensive canon of shark cinema it should be. All it knows is that sharks are scary and that Blake Lively is pretty; both are true but as observations meant to drive a movie they are also pretty shallow.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In studies of marital satisfaction over time Sanderson said ""there is in fact a positive correlation for some people. Guess who those people are? Men.

The beach was the favorite of her late mother whom Nancy is still mourning and whose incurable illness led Nancy to despair of the medical profession. Yet when a shark attacks Nancy and opens a deep gash on her thigh those medical skills come in handy she uses earrings to stitch herself up. For the next two days Nancy--prevented from swimming to shore by the marauding beast--takes refuge on a small rock formation while keeping an eye on the tides that briefly submerge it. The director Jaume Collet-Serra keeps Nancy and the shark busy but offers no distinctive perspective on the action or for that matter on the situation. Another surfers GoPro conveniently floats toward her rock but the spoken testament that Nancy leaves on video veers toward the generic. The movie doesnt give Nancy much of an inner life and it offers no sense of the mind-bending force of fear.

"Shallows The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; shallows-the ) Shallows The (United States 2016) June 25 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Shallows is almost a good movie. It misses by this much (hold thumb and index finger apart by an inch). For 75 of its 85 minutes its a gripping woman-against-nature tale with tough determined Nancy (Blake Lively) facing her own infirmities a hostile environment and a hungry great white shark. The films problem is that after chronicling Nancys nightmarish 12 hours on a tiny rock island director Jaume Collet-Serra and screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski dont know how to end things. Their choice of a resolution is preposterous and underwhelming. The lingering bad taste was sufficiently potent to dull any lingering good feelings I might have harbored about the production as a whole. The straightforward story culls elements from 127 Hours All is Lost Open Water and (of course) Jaws. The survival tale can be seen as a thinly-veiled allegory about people pushing through imaginary barriers and persevering. Keeping that in mind the ending isnt as bad as it might seem if viewed purely from a concrete perspective. The Shallows follows Nancy to a secluded Mexican beach where she plans to do a little surfing while honoring her mothers memory. About 200 yards offshore she becomes the target of a great white shark after she inadvertently enters its feeding territory. She survives the initial encounter and makes it to a small islet where she uses her skills as a medical student to close the wound. As darkness falls she realizes shes in a race against time - when high tide arrives (again) in about 12 hours her island will be under water and there will be nothing to prevent the shark from turning her into breakfast. To make matters worse several would-be rescuers become appetizers. Its difficult for any film to follow a lone character for the better part of 90 minutes. The best recent examples are 127 Hours (with James Franco trapped by a collapsed rock) and All is Lost (with Robert Redford adrift on the high seas). The Shallows follows their lead by getting into the characters psyche. For Nancy this situation is especially frustrating - she can see safety. Shes close enough that she can call out to the few passers-by on the beach. But shes also in pain suffering from blood loss and dehydration and doomed if she leaves her perch. The shark is like Jaws - huge powerful and relentless. Collet-Serra whose previous endeavors include Non-Stop and Run All Night keeps us involved by continually ratcheting up the tension. The approach of high tide represents a different kind of countdown and the filmmakers camera captures Nancys sense of peril as isolation grips her. Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away she needs something to talk to. In this case its an injured sea gull. As was the case with James Franco in 127 Hours Blake Lively proves she can hold the cameras attention for the majority of the films running time. For perhaps 60 of The Shallows 85 minutes its just her the sea gull and the shark. Although she has been good in other films (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants comes to mind) none have required this degree of physicality. And although her transformation isnt as fully realized as that of say Reese Witherspoon in Wild its nevertheless credible. The harrowing scene where Nancy stitches her wound without anesthetic is played to perfection. (The movie skirts the edge of the PG-13 envelope with a few gory shots. This is really R-rated material.) When Jaws was released 41 years ago its cultural impact extended beyond movie theaters. Beach-goers were jittery about entering the surf - even in areas where there had been no shark sightings. The Shallows wont have the same impact but it functions as a solidly entertaining thriller. Its just too bad the screenplay didnt avoid the idiot plot device it employs to bring things to a conclusion. Its always a disappointment when a film ends on a sour note but the dissatisfaction is more acute when its the only part of the experience that doesnt work.

Add to the list of actors who beautifully and boldly go it alone in their own survival movies the name Blake Lively. Do it without laughing because shes the shark here Even though The Shallows a tremendously entertaining bit of fluff pits her against a computer-generated great white the poor creature never stands a chance. Lively joins a group of nobodies that includes Robert Redford (All Is Lost) Tom Hanks (Cast Away) and a boulder-challenged James Franco (127 Hours) but if you ever saw her swan her way through an episode of Gossip Girl youll know that she thrives in piranha-infested waters. The Shallows is her Speed and shes Keanu. Based on a lean original script (by Anthony Jaswinski) that was probably written in between pina coladas on a beach somewhere the movie takes justifiable pride in its minimalism. Texas-bred surfer and med-school dropout Nancy (Lively) arrives at the secluded Mexican paradise where her mother a recent victim of cancer once frolicked. There she hopes to connect with something other than her grief. You can feel Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra--best known for coaching an unkillable Liam Neeson in Unknown and Non-Stop--racing through these early scenes somewhat awkwardly. Nancys best friend? Back at the hotel nursing a hangover. That pesky cell phone and its invasive chat windows that keep popping up? Stowed in the backpack. The turquoise water beckons. Thats what The Shallows is about--pure wordless sensation shot in various flavors of tush-ogling slo-mo--and when the water turns crimson it only gets better. Yanked out of her reverie by a leg chomp Nancy flops onto a tiny rock just a few hundred yards offshore where shell have to outwit a swirling predator sew up her own wound with earrings (ouch) therapize a neurotic seagull survive the night and somehow signal to the mainland for help. Before I throw too much chum in the water know this isnt Jaws. Theres no larger dimension here no elemental poetry. But its taken some shrewd calculation to realize that Lively with her beachy glow and thrust-out chin could carry this thing. The movie requires this particular star body and soul and Livelys confidence turns it into a piece of pop empowerment even when realism starts slipping away in the final stretches. Shell never be as good in anything else again because The Shallows is her siren song--it fits her like a wetsuit.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan June 23 A young surfer named Nancy (Blake Lively) is stranded 200 yards from shore at a secluded beach after being attacked by a great white shark. As the shark circles her rock she must figure out how to get to safety. (Sony Pictures) Its helpful to think of ""The Shallows"" -- the spare yet serviceable new shark-themed thriller starring Blake Lively -- as less of a 21st-century ""Jaws"" than a distaff version of ""127 Hours."" Like that 2010 drama which notched James Franco an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of an increasingly desperate hiker whose arm has become wedged between a boulder and a canyon wall ""The Shallows"" is essentially a one-person show in very close quarters. For most of the movie Livelys character is stranded on a rock 200 yards off of a remote Mexican beach after being bitten by a great white shark while surfing. That beast rendered in convincing CGI continues to circle her menacingly as well as somewhat inexplicably considering (a) she has no meat on her bones; (b) it has just eaten three other people; and (c) theres a buffet of rotting whale carcass a short swim away. As packaged by writer Anthony Jaswinski and director Jaume Collet-Serra -- best known for the Liam Neeson thrillers ""Unknown"" ""Non-Stop"" ""Run All Night"" and the forthcoming ""The Commuter"" -- this fish tale gives off something of a Moby-Dick stink due to the giant hook that appears to have become lodged in the critters lip. This makes for an angry -- and scary -- monster and the film establishes a nice drumbeat of mounting tension and dread. Nancy (Blake Lively) travels to a remote beach where she finds herself faced with a great white shark in ""The Shallows."" (Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) Lively however is probably not going to win any awards for her performance which mostly consists of screaming in agony as her character a med school dropout named Nancy performs emergency surgery (using a couple of pieces of jewelry) on the nasty flap of thigh meat that has been all but torn away. There is almost no dialogue other than Nancy talking to herself or to the injured sea gull -- a fellow shark victim -- with whom she shares her precarious ocean perch. ""Are you still out there?"" Nancy mutters to her marine tormentor at just about the movies halfway point. Like ""Jaws"" theres a lot of waiting around for the inevitable water-churning climax. All that said its still nice -- really nice -- to see a film about a woman in jeopardy who turns out to be resourceful and brave. The camera may linger at times a bit too long on Nancys bikini bottom or on the decolletage of her neoprene wet suit jacket but shes no helpless damsel in distress. Thats as refreshing as a dip in the ocean. Collet-Serra has a good eye for scenery too. Although the surfing sequences are merely adequate the beach setting is beautifully shot even in the scariest scenes. Is ""The Shallows"" a thriller for the ages? No but its decent popcorn fare. Its about as deep as the titular lagoon on which its set but the breakers promise a short and heart-pounding ride with no wipeout. The Shallows (85 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for graphic bloody images including do-it-yourself surgery intense sequences of peril and brief crude language. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 24 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 24 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra Written by Anthony Jaswinski Starring Blake Lively Classification 14A Country USA Language English The poster slogan for this summers surf-and-shark shocker reads ""What was once in the deep is now in the shallows."" This isnt movie marketing mumbo-jumbo - the films original title was In the Deep. The tagline as veiled truth then.And perhaps what might look to be simple aquatic horror from House of Wax director Jaume Collet-Serra is profound metaphor? Blake Lively is a tanned-and-toned med student (disillusioned with her line of work after her mother dies of an illness for which modern medicine offers no cure) who takes off to a remote Mexican beach for waves and solace.She ends up bitten bloody and bikinied on a rock. Guarding its dead-whale supper a shark - a circling symbol of greed - sees her as a threat. At high tide shell be flooded off safe ground - an allusion to oceans rising and the threat of global warming perhaps.Will she give up? Or will she fight? Ah who cares. Sharknado isnt Shakespeare and The Shallows isnt deep. Schools out schlocks in - no lessons here.

Thats when she makes the acquaintance of a great white which introduces itself by taking a rather large bite of her leg. She then makes her way to a rock about 200 yards away from the shore and tries to make it safely to land.Collet-Serra director of Liam Neeson movies (hes made ""Non-Stop"" ""Run All Night"" and ""Unknown"" with Neeson) brings steady visceral chills sparingly showing the shark early on and letting its presence be its own menace.Lively is perhaps a bit too calm and together especially considering shes nursing a gaping wound and has only an apple in her stomach. But for what it is ""The Shallows"" works. Its just as much about our own fears and what we bring to it as whats up on screen.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284Twitter grahamoramaThe ShallowsGRADE B-Rated PG-13 for bloody images intense sequences of peril and brief strong language 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/28UeeRn MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/06/23/movie-review-shark-thriller-shallows-stays-afloat/86317676/,200,theshallows7,theshallows,detroitnews

Armed with a surfboard and a cell phone Nancy uses FaceTime chat to call home and establish her Texas backstory. Her kid sister wishes she could join her. Her dad is still angry that Nancy wants to drop out of medical school -- moms death hit her hard. At first Nancy encounters a different kind of predator. Two Mexican surfer dudes are already in her space in the otherwise deserted cove. And ones conveniently wearing a GoPro camera on his head. They casually hit on her to join them. She smiles but hangs back. Hey wait how much setup can thrill-seeking audiences endure? Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Non-Stop) and screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski feel you pain. Thats why they start the movie with a flash-forward in which a young boy finds the camera on the beach and the video footage shows the surfers getting gobbled up good by the shark. Now were talking. Back on the beach we watch Livelys stunt double hang 10 and ride a huge wave in which the shark can be seen in chilling outline. Otherwise Nancys alone out there. Previously the guys -- no slouches at exposition -- had told her about a jagged rock 200 yards off shore that you can only see at low tide. Will Nancy need that rock when the shark strands her in the water? Will studios continue to charge top dollar for tickets to movies that strain credulity to the snapping point? The rest of the movie shows Nancy and the shark dueling for dominance. Given her medical training our heroine can turn a wet suit into a tourniquet or use her necklace to stitch up a nasty gash. As Nancy waits for a rescue she pours out her feelings to a wounded seagull who seems to represent her dead mom. (Im figuring the shark is a symbolic warning not to quit school.) Its all patently ridiculous. But Collet-Serra and Lively show no mercy in hooking us with the B-movie tension. And we bite.

Come on were talking BLAKE VS. SHARK. Shes not Blake Lively; shes BLAKE DEADLY. That shark wont know what bit him Dont be fooled by the bikini and the surfer-chick blonde hair buddy boy. They should have made a one-sheet resembling a classic boxing poster for this movie. Im not going to tell you ""The Shallows"" isnt dumb corny hilariously over-the-top and cheese-upon-cheesy. Im not going to tell you it deserves to swim with the likes of ""Jaws"" and ""Open Water"" as a shark-infested thriller. Nor can I mount any kind of defense for the final 15 minutes of this film with a climactic scene so insanely ridiculous and beyond implausible I actually clapped and I almost never clap at the movies. What I will tell ya is this is an immensely entertaining millennial B-Movie made for summertime viewing. This is the kind of film in which our heroine befriends a wounded bird and names it ... SPOILER ALERT ... Steven Seagull. Thats so bad its great. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (who helmed the Liam Neeson thrillers ""Run All Night"" ""Non-Stop"" and ""Unknown"") is so smitten with the lovely Ms. Lively his camera practically bumps into her face during an early scene in which she takes a ride through Mexico in search of ""a secret beach."" Its close-up after close-up after close-up reminding us Lively is one of the most photogenic actresses of her time. Livelys Nancy Adams (hows that for a name out of a 1950s detective series?) is an adventurous but apparently ennui-imbued Texan who recently dropped out of medical school just before becoming a doctor and has made a pilgrimage to a legendary beach that had special meaning for her mother who recently died of cancer. (Lively is from Tarzana California and has California Surf Chick written all over her and she doesnt even attempt a Texas accent. Why didnt they just have Nancy Adams hail from Cali? Ah who cares. This is BLAKE VS. SHARK people.) Were looking at a running time of fewer than 90 minutes so as soon as we learn Nancys back story and we meet a few supporting characters who may or may not become shark snack fodder Nancy is attacked by the aforementioned beast of the shallows who digs into her thigh before she can make her way to a jagged rock formation just out of his reach. Remember Nancy Adams had almost completed med school before she dropped out to go on this spiritual journey. Her training comes in super-handy particularly in a scene where she uses earrings and other jewelry to suture the leg. Cue the lingering close-ups of the self-surgery specifically designed to make you groan and laugh nervously as Nancy talks herself through the procedure. Filmed in New South Wales Australia ""The Shallows"" is a great-looking film peppered with overhead long shots of the amazingly clear water and some terrific underwater photography as well. Lively is a real gamer in a physical role that calls for her to swim surf endure shark bites and jellyfish stings and were just getting started. Even when shes suffering from dehydration gaping wounds early onset gangrene hunger and thirst she still looks better than most humans do after a 10-day vacation. Most of Livelys scenes are monologues and while shes not about to make you forget about a young Meryl Streep shes solid and convincing in the role. As for the shark As is the case with almost every movie shark hes more frightening when we dont see him or we catch fleeting glimpses of him. Director Collet-Serra has terrific thriller timing to the point where we KNOW that dang shark is about to jump into frame and yet its still an excellent scare moment when it does surface. Even after chomping on a few victims and feasting on a whale it apparently killed the shark has a real thing for Nancy. She devises a number of ingenious and risky plans to stretch out her survival time but no matter what she does she cant shake that shark. Eventually theyre going to face off one-on-one and thats when ""The Shallows"" flies right off the rails and youll find it difficult to suppress your laughter -- So dont Put on your virtual ""TEAM BLAKE"" T-shirt and enjoy the ride.  Columbia Pictures presents a film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and written by Anthony Jaswinski. Running time 85 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for bloody images intense sequences of peril and brief strong language). Opens Friday at local theaters.

That isnt a Jacuzzi churning the water. Credit Vince Valitutti/Columbia Pictures Sony Pictures Releasing Blake Lively is introduced in this thriller riding in a rugged roadster and peering at a smartphone while a scraggly-bearded longhaired driver navigates rough forest terrain. Ms. Livelys character Nancy is not a tech addict as such Shes looking at pictures of her mother now dead who was pregnant with her when she visited the secret Mexican beach Nancy is now seeking. Once she hits the sand Nancy proves game and capable and in the moment. After using the phone one more time to check in with her little sister and her dad for some back story she tethers herself to her surfboard puts on the top half of a wet suit and hits the waves.The next 15 minutes of ""The Shallows"" directed by Jaume Collet-Serra from a script by Anthony Jaswinski are delightful. The vistas (with Australia standing in for Mexico) are staggering the water a heavenly blue and Ms. Lively is made to look like a very able surfer. Nancys Spanish skills are insufficient for any real conversation with the two native dudes who share the surf with her but everyones vibe is friendly. Mr. Collet-Serras busy visual style which uses a lot of fast-cutting willy-nilly variations between slow and fast motion and illogical but vivid point-of-view shots seems at least somewhat apt under the exhilarating circumstances.But then of course a shark approximately the size of an ocean liner has to show up and spoil everything. Video Trailer The Shallows A preview of the film. By SONY PICTURES on Publish Date April 22 2016. Photo by Sony Pictures. Watch in Times Video >> embed The shark is first seen maintaining perfect forward-moving equilibrium inside the crest of a wave so its not just an unusually large shark but its also one that can defy the laws of physics. Its also very hungry and peculiarly spiteful. Ms. Livelys Nancy must first avoid then defeat this menace alone.For all its skills the shark turns out to be a pretty thin hook on which to hang a less-than-90-minute movie. Since ""The Shallows"" is a star vehicle for the attractive and statuesque Ms. Lively the suspense here is somewhat circumscribed. So the movie also applies gruesome special effects. Theres some self-surgery and the shark finds several reluctant snacks to munch on. Ms. Livelys screen presence has always traded on a healthy confidence. That quality skates close to entitlement much of the time; her appeal is very Girl Next Door provided the street in question is Rodeo Drive. But she acquits herself well here especially in the vulnerable-to-shark-attack department. The movies makeup crew does its bit by showing that every time Nancy resolves to take action against her aquatic tormentor her face regains color and her lips become unparched.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Dappled by glints of Capri Sun light the blue waves of a secluded Mexican beach beckon the young and hardbodied to surf and fall prey to a humongous CGI shark in The Shallows a fitfully entertaining mix of offscreen gore and Maxim-esque Tamp;A. Med student Nancy (Blake Lively) goes out surfing alone only to have the shark take a bite out of her thigh. Trapped on an outcrop of rock a few hundred yards from shore she is helpless to watch as surfers and would-be beach thieves also get chomped the wound on her leg growing more and more fetid. Hamstrung by a PG-13 rating the movies juxtaposition of lithe and gangrenous bodies and nature at its most picture-perfect and disgusting (see the rotting humpback whale carcass that first hints at danger) squirms too much to come across as a true nightmare scenario.Instead The Shallows finds its too-brief moments of suspense in Nancys attempts to MacGyver her way back to shore using her earrings as medical staples or a swarm of stinging jellyfish as cover against her great white nemesis. Director Jaume Collet-Serra is a reliable hand at gimmicky genre pieces but he makes only sporadic use of the heroines limited point of view. Viewers hoping for a repeat of the directors superbly entertaining Liam Neeson thriller Non-Stop a locked-room mystery set aboard a trans-Atlantic flight may be sorely disappointed. However The Shallows gives Collet-Serra even more opportunities to visualize text messages and screens using large translucent pop-ups in lieu of close-up shots--making conflicts between technology and nature and idyll and reality an essential part of the movies mise-en-scene. Introduced as shes getting a lift from friendly local/exposition sounding board Carlos (Oscar Jaenada) Nancy has come out to Mexico to find the spot where her late mother surfed 25 years earlier near an island that resembles a pregnant woman lying in profile. Its one of several dreamlike images that pop up in The Shallows. From its lens-flare-speckled cheesecake shots of toned bodies to the fairy-tale-like moon that hovers over the water at night the movie is better at synthesizing fantasies of the beach than at shattering them; its shark one of those elastic-looking digital monsters that seems to change size from shot to shot is good for a few early jump scares.Nancy keeps pinning her hopes on gadgets--be it a waterproof watch a phone she left on the beach or a flare gun locked in a nearby buoy--and on strangers who either cant hear her or cant understand her very limited Spanish. The way back to the beach close enough to be within shouting distance is through the irrational. But Anthony Jaswinskis screenplay bogs down this no-brainer survival premise (""get off the rock and dont die"") with needless backstory and inchoate themes. Cant a heroine just survive a vicious shark attack without also having to overcome a family trauma and make a decision about whether or not she wants to be a doctor?

Vince Valitutti/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Vince Valitutti/Sony Pictures Nancy (Blake Lively) in The Shallows. Vince Valitutti/Sony Pictures The Shallows the second-best aquatic adventure now playing at a theater near you looks at first glance like an attempt to restore a modicum of respectability to the genre Jaws wrought. (I mean shark-flicks specifically not the predatory invasive species of the sensation-driven summer blockbuster.) The Great White stars of the Jawsiad quickly ceased to resemble any beasts found in nature -- they were bringing down helicopters as early as 1978s Jaws 2. But even Jaws The Revenge (""This time its personal"") looks like Gorillas in the Mist compared to the 21st century made-for-Syfy-shark-portmanteau plague which asserts that camp is a thing you can engineer the way the scientists in 1999s Deep Blue Sea engineered sharks with ape-level intelligence. The cruel fact is that bad movies trying their durndest to be good will always be more rewarding than bad movies that are bad on purpose. Sharkenfreude the Germans call this phenomenon. The Shallows tries its durndest and its certainly got more bite than that chum on basic cable. You have to admire the elegance of its premise Blake Lively is stranded just a 90-second paddle away from shore. Thats the movie. But dont let the CGI shark (and jellyfish) fool you The film that is The Shallows true inspiration is Gravity the multi-Oscar-winning Sandra-Bullock-stranded-in-orbit thriller of three years ago. As in Gravity this films sole concern is a grieving but deeply resourceful woman who confronted with the prospect of her imminent death makes the decision to do the hard thing and survive. Bullocks character was a doctor in mourning while Lively plays... a medical student in mourning. In this genre the physical trial -- getting back to Earth killing the submarine-sized shark that wants to eat you -- is always an externalized representation of mortal grief. Survive and ye shall be healed. Director Jaume Collet-Serra is no Alfonso Cuaron but he has plenty of experience at this sort of thing prior to plumbing The Shallows he made three consecutive films with Liam Neeson our cinematic patron saint of violent moping. The far more prevalent male-led version of this genre requires the despondent hero -- usually a widower but sometimes a contrite divorcee -- not merely to escape death but to kill his way back to sound mental health. Anyway The Shallows is a thoroughly mediocre specimen of the externalized-grief survival flick distinguished by a strong performance from Gossip Girl alumnus Lively. She plays a Texan on a pilgrimage to find the secret Mexican beach (the movie was shot in Queensland Australia) where her mom once surfed while pregnant with her (against medical advice presumably). The picture at its most destabilizing in its early scenes when all we know is that a young woman is traveling alone among strange men in a foreign country. Are they honest? Will they try to hurt her? You dont want to come off like a paranoid privileged American but there are predators in these waters. As it were. In the non-metaphorical waters there are those shark-vision shots of dangling legs that Steven Spielberg made famous 40 years ago complemented by human point-of-view shots meant to have been captured on a helmet-mounted Go-Pro worn by a surfer who got eaten. More distracting are the picture-in-picture inserts that show us the photos and text messages Lively is looking at on her phone which tell us nothing that isnt already conveyed in dialogue. Contrast this with the artier solo-survival-at-sea thriller All Is Lost wherein Robert Redford discovers an old letter. We never learn who sent it or what it says. Everything we actually need to know is conveyed by Redfords face as he reads in silence. Lively is a capable actor; she could have pulled off that sort of thing if Collet-Serra had that kind of confidence in her or us. But he doesnt have it in himself -- he throws up title cards periodically letting us know its SIX HOURS TO HIGH TIDE for instance. Keeping a tally of how many how hours Lively has been stranded on a slowly-shrinking rock severely injured and exhausted and starving and dehydrated doesnt add to the suspense in any real way. Whats the point of telling us anything thats outside of her characters subjective experience? For most of the films uncommonly brief run-time (yet another quality it shares with Gravity) Livelys sole companion is a white bird whose injured wing she takes it upon herself to mend. The film reaches its climax inspiration-wise when she names him Steven Seagull. Remember Steven Seagal? He wasnt working out emotional demons when he killed people in his movies; he just did it because that was his beady-eyed nature. He was very sharklike in that way.

Its a cinematic challenge almost a dare in which the director must entertain an audience for 90 minutes using only the barest essentials. Can Collet-Serra whose 2014 espionage thriller ""Non-Stop"" took place almost entirely within a passenger jet pull off another high-pressure filmmaking stunt? His lead cast comprises only one actress Blake Lively a classic California blonde who semi-convincingly plays a native Texan Nancy Adams. According to cellphone photos and a video chat with the family (Brett Cullen plays her dad Sedona Legge her little sister) Nancy is a med school dropout whos gone to Mexico to find one of those secret unnamed surf spots. All Nancy knows is that this particular beach had special meaning to her mother who recently died of cancer. ""She was a fighter"" says Dad who fears his daughter is slipping away too. advertisement | advertise on newsday Yeah yeah -- wheres the shark? He waits in the wings for a while then reveals himself slowly much like his famous ancestor in ""Jaws."" He chomps Nancys board and slices her leg then corners her on a little rock just 200 yards from shore. Although theres plenty of whale and dolphin around for him to eat this shark wants that girl. SUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerPhotos31 big summer blockbustersCritics picksBest summer blockbusters of all time What happens next is mostly a waiting game for Nancy and for us. Nancy sutures her leg using two earrings () and plans her survival strategy out loud but her options are limited. Anthony Jaswinskis barely there script throws in few complications and no plot twists at all. The shark almost has a personality -- we suspect hes intelligent and the hook in his cheek suggests a vengeful attitude -- but he never dredges up any deeper fears or emotions within us. And heres a question Why doesnt this gargantuan creature just lunge onto that rock and grab her? ""The Shallows"" deserves credit for trying to squeeze maximum thrills out of a minimalist setup but it doesnt really succeed. In the end Collet-Serra may have bit off more -- or is it less? -- than he can chew.

(Theres even an island that reminds her of a pregnant woman lying on her back -- head breasts and belly rising from the sea.) Though her surf buddy has remained behind she braves the waves even as night comes on (thanks to an upsetting phone chat with Dad during which she wonders why Mom bothered fighting so hard to stay alive).

Lively -- who along with that massive shark is the whole movie -- stars as Nancy an American medical student searching out a special beach in Mexico. Nancys late mother it seems had often talked about a secret beach with excellent surfing and the young woman is determined to find the spot. Soon enough shes on that beach and on her surfboard. Nancy befriends two young men who are also surfing that day. The men leave at the end of the day. Nancy paddles out to catch one more wave. Instead she catches the sharks attention. Filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan; Non-Stop) builds slowly to the action scenes first creating an endearing three-dimensional Nancy and setting her in a magnificent landscape on a perfect day. Nancy is a golden girl capable and athletic but she is also going through personal loss and emotional confusion. Theres a lot going on under her sunny surface; the story reflects that tension. The Shallows starts with crystal clear water in bright sunshine but dread builds every time the camera dips below the surface and hints at the vast unknown beneath. Nancy encounters the shark; she is bitten in the leg and takes shelter on a small outcrop of rock visible only at low tide. After that its a race against time and nature. Shes not far from shore but just far enough to be stranded and left to her own resources. At times this viewer wished The Shallows had a bit more bite (it has a PG rating) but this aint Jaws-with-women. The story is about Nancy not her great white nemesis. The idea that a man might wander onto the beach and rescue her is -- crunch -- a non-starter here. If shes going to be saved shell have to save herself. The Shallows is brisk and engaging and a great vehicle for Lively. The film has the sort of breathtaking cinematography that will inspire you to visit the ocean.

Lively -- who along with that massive shark is the whole movie -- stars as Nancy an American medical student searching out a special beach in Mexico. Nancys late mother it seems had often talked about a secret beach with excellent surfing and the young woman is determined to find the spot. Soon enough shes on that beach and on her surfboard. Nancy befriends two young men who are also surfing that day. The men leave at the end of the day. Nancy paddles out to catch one more wave. Instead she catches the sharks attention. Filmmaker Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan; Non-Stop) builds slowly to the action scenes first creating an endearing three-dimensional Nancy and setting her in a magnificent landscape on a perfect day. Nancy is a golden girl capable and athletic but she is also going through personal loss and emotional confus Top stories Popular Latest Videos Blue Jays use 7-run inning to beat Orioles jump into first place in AL East Bullets fly at Christie Pits park boot camp Suicide Squad Jared Leto wants Joker to go up against Ben Afflecks Batman Mayor John Tory kicks off the dancing at start of Caribbean Carnival parade Police ID man killed in rooming house Blue Jays use 7-run inning to beat Orioles jump into first place in AL East Suicide Squad Jared Leto wants Joker to go up against Ben Afflecks Batman Governor John Simcoe and his canvas houses Bullets fly at Christie Pits park boot camp Plane evacuated at Pearson Forcillo Sentencing TTC Surveillance Footage of Sammy Yatim Shooting Woman calls out sexual harassment on subway Long Plain First Nations chief addresses band following tornado on reserve Ford back at city hall More from Movies Suicide Squad Jared Leto wants Joker to go up against Ben Afflecks Batman Suicide Squad star Joel Kinnaman praises films realistic action Suicide Squad Who are the villains populating DCs next hit?

Comments click to enlarge The Shallows Video Rated PG-13  87 minutes  2016 Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown Non-Stop) directed this nail-biter about a Texas surfer and medical school dropout (Blake Lively) whos terrorized by a great white shark in the waters off a secluded Mexican beach. Livelys athleticism more than compensates for her limited emotional expressiveness as her character tries to outsmart the relentless predator a preternaturally malevolent specimen that can chomp through a steel buoy. Her companion throughout this long lonely ordeal is a wounded seagull the movies version of Wilson the volleyball in Cast Away. This is silly stuff but often genuinely scary with excellent aerial and undersea photography and some persuasive special effects. You want realism watch the Discovery Channel; this is pure escapism.

"The Shallows Come on in the waters Lively - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Shallows Come on in the waters Lively ""The Shallows"" Vince Vali / Columbia Pictures Blake Lively in the movie ""The Shallows."" Blake Lively in the movie ""The Shallows."" (Vince Vali / Columbia Pictures) Justin Chang Theres an excellent movie now in theaters a deeply moving adventure about a traumatized young female who plunges into unfamiliar waters and experiences terror and salvation by way of some computer-generated marine life. But enough about ""Finding Dory."" If youre looking for a quick and satisfying summer thrill -- a reminder that all you really need to make a movie is a girl and a flare gun -- then the aptly titled Blake Lively-vs.-shark thriller ""The Shallows"" should serve you nicely.It serves Lively best of all. If Hollywood has seemed slow to appreciate this talented actress (the popularity of the CWs now-defunct ""Gossip Girl"" notwithstanding) the tide would appear to be turning on the evidence of this efficiently pared-down B-movie showcase whose taut suspense and fat-free narrative seem to have been conceived along the same lines as its stars enviable musculature. You will see Lively do richer subtler acting in the future (as early as next month when Woody Allens ""Cafe Society"" arrives in theaters). But she meets all the requirements of this high-concept one-woman show and then some intense physical stamina some stunt-double-abetted surfing and the ability to look good in a bikini from every possible angle. Better still she effortlessly holds her own opposite a computer-generated chomper that the director Jaume Collet-Serra is smart enough to keep mostly hidden until the noisy fiery hilariously over-the-top (and under-the-bottom) finale. Faux-shark technology may have advanced by leaps and bounds since ""Jaws"" but even in the era of Shark Week ""Sharknado"" and Trolli sour-watermelon shark candies ""The Shallows"" suggests that the lessons of Steven Spielbergs blockbuster hold as true as they did in 1975. SNAP Video Official trailer for The Shallows Official trailer for The Shallows See more videos Its a gorgeous afternoon when Nancy (Lively) a Texas-tanned surfer arrives at a secluded beach somewhere on the Mexican coast. The sun is shining the water an inviting shade of blue the use of slo-mo exquisite. In the course of a few text messages and video chats Anthony Jaswinskis mechanical screenplay lays out Nancys situation with amusing briskness an isolated location a no-show best friend a worried dad a beloved mother whose recent death from cancer is causing her to second-guess her dreams of becoming a doctor. Naturally that medical training will come in handy when Nancy after doing some fancy dancy-prancy on her surfboard is suddenly bitten by a great white and forced to take refuge on a large rock that becomes a tiny outcropping at high tide. Shes bleeding heavily from a leg wound the suturing of which is shown in all its gory glory but at least shes alive unlike some of the other surfers and onlookers unfortunate enough to enter this deadly cove. Trapped just a few hundred yards from a shore that has never looked more tantalizing Nancy must fend off not only her predator but also the ravages of hunger thirst and exhaustion with only a friendly downed seagull for company. (The seagull even has a name but Im trying to avoid spoilers.)High-concept survivalist dramas have become an unusually rich and varied Hollywood subgenre in recent years with a dramatic bandwidth elastic enough to accommodate the hopped-up intensity of ""127 Hours"" the sublime minimalism of ""All Is Lost"" and the astronomical razzle-dazzle of ""Gravity."" Thats partly a testament to the remarkable range of digital technologies at play here but its also an instructive testament to the importance of star power. Livelys vehicle doesnt aspire to those films prestige depths and it doesnt need to; her fierce commitment to the role is all the profundity it needs. (The actress has said that she was inspired by ""Buried"" in which Ryan Reynolds now her husband played a man trapped in a coffin.)And on its own unpretentious unapologetically pleasure-seeking terms ""The Shallows"" has enough to recommend it -- not least the fact that you could watch it twice in roughly the same amount of time it would take to watch ""The Revenant"" and with little appreciable loss in adrenaline or poetry. Collet-Serra is a genre-savvy action director with two notorious shockers (""House of Wax"" ""Orphan"") and three Liam Neeson smash-em-ups (""Unknown"" ""Non-Stop"" ""Run All Night"") under his belt and for all that studio-manufactured sound and fury he seems to have intuitively grasped the more scaled-down needs of this assignment.Working expertly in tandem with the cinematographer Flavio Labiano and the editor Joel Negron Collet-Serra keeps the movie bobbing nicely alongside his star delivering a new frisson of unease every time the camera plunges beneath the ever-rising and falling surface. He has fun teasing us with process and minutiae the precise mechanical operation of a buoy the defensive properties of a school of jellyfish the number of seconds it takes the shark to swim a lap around its feeding zone. Speaking of time With its thoroughly unnecessary closing scene this blissfully short 86-minute movie would play even better at 85 but lets just shut up and enjoy the air conditioning. ------------The ShallowsMPAA rating PG-13 for bloody images intense sequences of peril and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 26 minutesPlaying In wide release See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Blake Lively Surfing Ryan Reynolds Steven Spielberg Liam Neeson Woody Allen HBOs new programming boss talks True Detectives fate pulling the plug on Vinyl and a hope for more diversity Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-shallows-review-20160620-snap-story.html,200,theshallows17,theshallows,latimes
"My what big teeth you have The Shallows review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMy what big teeth you have The Shallows reviewYoull never forget Jaws while watching The Shallows as Blake Livelys lone surfer does battle with a marauding shark. Blake Lively has a potentially star-making role as a woman battling a shark in The Shallows.  (VINCE VALITUTTI / COLUMBIA PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 23 2016The ShallowsStarring. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. Opens Friday at major theatres. 86 minutes. 14AOf course youre going to think of Jaws while watching The Shallows.Director Jaume Collet-Serra expects and encourages this. He and screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski toss in so many callbacks to Steven Spielbergs 1975 summer blockbuster their efficient homage risks being viewed as a blatant rip-off -- although its more clever than that. Article Continued BelowThe movie plays as an extended ""what if?"" to the opening of Jaws right down to the careless girl the ominous red buoy and the hungry shark.Nancy (Blake Lively) a medical student mourning the recent death of her mother seems almost suicidal in her vacation abandon. Shes determined to surf the remote Mexican beach her mom loved despite being alone and not having arranged for a return ride.""Im reliable"" she insists to her concerned driver who takes that to mean ""bossy."" However one interprets her tenacity Nancy will soon need it. While surfing about 200 metres from shore shes attacked by a giant shark barely escaping it by clambering onto a rock outcrop. Now she has to figure out how to get back to dry land as the rising tide threatens immersion her injured leg bleeds and the voracious CGI shark hovers.This is potentially a star-making role for Lively who usually is in the supporting cast of her films. Sexy without being Baywatch ridiculous -- despite the bright orange bikini and Flavio Labianos voyeuristic camera -- shes also athletic enough to convince as surfer and shark fighter.Collet-Serra knows how to maintain suspense and to set up jump scares which he previously demonstrated in the horror film Orphan and several Liam Neeson actioners.He tosses in 21st-century updates involving cellphones and a helmet-cam video. The other people who enter the scene of this otherwise one-woman drama all of them unsuspecting males quickly discover that ""shark"" is English for ""Youre lunch"" in this context.The director is no hostage to logic even when he inspires eye rolls over Nancys amazing suturing skills with earrings or her new-found ability as a bird whisperer to avian pal ""Steven Seagull"" another CGI critter. The Shallows pushes the buttons its supposed topush for a summerthriller even if the outcome is as deflating as it dumb. Youll never forget Jaws while watching it likely appreciating all the more the scarier movie Spielberg made using suggestion sound and a rubber shark.

Photo Sony Pictures MOVIE REVIEW THE SHALLOWS Running time 87 minutes. Rated PG-13 (bloody violence profanity). So there I was swimming around my fave safe space ""The Shallows"" of my Mexican cove 100 miles from nowhere when this blond surfer girl popped up without warning. Not even a sign saying ""Caution Blake Lively-infested waters."" Ive always been on the husky side and a little vicious. But a shark has a rep to protect. They dont call me the Good White know what Im saying? I admit I overreacted when I killed that blue whale for saying ""Hot enough for ya?"" Hey -- if you had 200 teeth and someone said that to you that would be that. I was munching on Dead Willys carcass when the lady came surfing by. You could tell there was potential for misunderstanding since one of us has a brain the size of a plum but enough about blondes. She cut herself on the reef. There was blood in the water. Plus shes in my space getting all up in my gills. How would she feel if I showed up at Kappa Delta and asked for her Hulu password? Also across her thorax she was wearing a string of yellow floss. Inviting. I nibbled her leg. Sue me I have a prehistoric side. But then the damnedest thing happened. She perched on a rock and got chatty. I dont know who she was talking to. I hear humans talk all the time but usually they keep it brief -- a little ""Blergggggh"" a hearty ""Aieeeee"" This one started jabbering about her ""medical school training"" and sewed up the cuts -- OK gashes -- with her jewelry. She spent a whole day on the rock as I lazily circled showing off my dorsal fin. Its my personal way of saying ""Tip o the hat to you my lady Soon you will be in my belly"" The sun was barbecuing her medium-rare and I heard her mention ""gangrene"" which is what I call ""steak sauce."" The girl kept talking and strategizing as heavy string music played on the soundtrack. This was doubly weird because a) it made me feel like the bad guy; and b) life doesnt normally have a soundtrack. Somehow the bitch got hold of a flare gun. Ever had a flare gun fired into your hide? Unpleasant. Look Im willing to let this go. Im gonna swim back over to her one more time invite her back to my place to listen to my favorite audiobook fairy tale about the USS Indianapolis. OK? Look Im smiling. Why is that ominous music playing again?

Blake Lively stars as Nancy who must outwit a hungry shark in ""The Shallows."" Photo Vince Valitutti Columbia Pictures The sharks the problem in tense Shallows 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Theres too much shark in ""The Shallows."" It swims circles around actress Blake Lively follows surfers in crashing waves and makes its complicated sharkly decisions in anticipation of human moves. By the end youll be convinced that this predator fish could play a game of chess or at least Clue. ""The Shallows"" is a very earnest woman-versus-shark film. It delivers the requisite thrills including a surprisingly satisfying resolution. The heroine is capable and the writers who trap her on a rock for half the film find ways to make her situation seem interesting. But the most important parts the ones involving the shark dont feel genuine. The shark in ""Jaws"" was scary because of what we didnt know. This shark acts like a horror movie villain as predictably relentless as Jason in a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel. Theres that word again -- ""Jaws."" Just as every San Francisco 49ers quarterback will always be unfairly compared to Joe Montana every shark film forever swims in the shadow of Steven Spielbergs 1975 epic horror/thriller/drama. The makers of ""The Shallows"" seem aware of this and they strip the film down to the marrow. Medical student Nancy (Lively) gets a ride to a remote beach in Mexico after her party-obsessed companion bails on her at the last minute. Shes attacked by a great white shark the size of a Ford Taurus station wagon and finds safety on a temporarily exposed small rock. But the tide is coming back in ... Here are a few things that feel genuine in ""The Shallows."" Our hero is scared The screenwriters do Lively very few favors with some awkward Tom Hanks-in-""Cast Away"" exposition-heavy monologues. (""Got to get some blood flowing. Lets loosen this tourniquet ..."") Theres a completely unnecessary and unbelievable subplot about quitting medical school. But working alone in most scenes Lively sells the terror of the situation. Mexico is an OK place The filmmakers finish one drunk overweight Mexican away from a film 100 percent free of stereotypes. Grading on a curve with other Hollywood films set in Mexico they get at least a B-plus. Nice job. Its a bad idea to surf alone Even if this were the worst shark film ever made it would serve as a solid 87-minute public service announcement on the dangers of getting in the ocean without a companion. Our hero has the worlds worst best friend You almost want Livelys character to die just so her drunken flake of a travel companion who cant overcome her hangover is guilt-racked for the rest of her life. Power through and get to the beach Nancys friend ""The Shallows"" is a lean 87 minutes and it would be closer to 67 minutes if it werent for all the slow motion. As the shark displays more human-like thought processes the script goes for broke with a few scientifically questionable but thoroughly satisfying action scenes. (Never have we been more sad that ""MythBusters"" is off the air.) This is not an epic film. But in defense of the filmmakers they probably werent trying to make one.

(Columbia Pictures) Watch the official trailer for ""The Shallows."" (Columbia Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Shot in a creamy sunny style suggesting a Sports Illustrated swimsuit-issue video shoot gone wrong ""The Shallows"" belongs almost entirely to Blake Lively who plays Nancy a resourceful medical student from Texas vacationing in Mexico with a purpose. Years ago her mother a recent casualty of cancer conceived her on the very beach (the ""secret beach"" everyone keeps calling it) where the doctor-in-training has brought her surfboard. There is a great white shark in the area however feeding on a dead whale. So the secret beach isnt such a good place to surf after all and the antagonist is starring in its own movie called ""Finding Lively.""MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR Whatever; its summer; its barely 80 minutes long minus the end credits. If the amount of surfing/suffering/staring-at-dark-skies footage rendered in slow motion were depicted at normal speed ""The Shallows"" would run about a minute and a half. In fact the real name of the beach may well be Camara Lenta which is Spanish for slow motion.The script by Anthony Jaswinski isolates Livelys character straight off. For much of the time Nancy who sutures her own shark-bite wound with a couple of handy earrings finds herself stranded on a rock with the tide coming in and only an injured sea gull for conversational company. Ideally a sequel to ""The Shallows"" (""Shallows 2 This Time Its Really Very Shallow"") would spin off the gull for its own film co-starring Wilson the volleyball from ""Cast Away"" and Daniel Radcliffes gassy corpse from the upcoming ""Swiss Army Man.""

(Columbia Pictures / Handout) The director is Jaume Collet-Serra who has made several modestly budgeted Liam Neeson films including ""Non-Stop."" That one confined its increasingly implausible but surprisingly engaging action to the inside of a plane. Here were in similarly tight circumstances. I hated the over-reliance on video chat and texting footage shown in supersize images on screen. (In these bits Brett Cullen plays Nancys dad concerned about her desires to drop out of med school and Sedona Legge is her younger sister.)

Do you? Have you ever seen a movie before?Were strictly in three-Cs territory with this one character stuff (grieving doubts family); cleavage; and chomping. According to the Scholastic paperback ""Shark Attack"" my daughters reading only ""three or four humans a year"" worldwide die from shark attacks. ""The Shallows"" respects those numbers though when the fatalities all happen in the same damn shallows you notice. The climactic battle of wits between human and shark leads to a conclusion that got the audience whooping pretty good.

While the box office is humming along just fine there arent a lot of movies that people are really talking about. Maybe thats why there seems to be such high hopes attached to the new Blake Lively shark movie The Shallows. No one really expected it to be Jaws -- or even especially ""good"" in the traditional sense of the word. But it does seem to pack the all-too-rare promise of being a perfectly stupid guilty pleasure. Which is precisely what it turns out to be. Lively doesnt break new ground as an actress (even for her). The dialogue is pretty laughable. And its disappointingly light on gratuitously crunchy Great White gore. If youre in the right mood though its a ridiculous eye-rolling hoot A sub-90 minute check-your-brain-at-the-ticket-window diversion not unlike 1997s Deep Blue Sea (minus the show-stopping Samuel L. Jackson death scene). Directed by Spanish junk-food action maestro Jaume Collet-Serra with the same pulpy preposterousness he brought to Liam Neesons Unknown and Non-Stop The Shallows stars Lively as Nancy Adams -- a resourceful med school dropout who travels to Mexico to find the secluded beach her late mother spoke of with dreamy reverence. After her traveling companion gets sidelined by a hangover the solo Nancy gets a lift to the white sand turquoise water surfers paradise from a hunky Mexican local (Oscar Jaenada). The spot is as breathtaking as she imagined. Nancy waxes her board and strips down to an orange bikini which Collet-Serras leering camera probably lingers on a couple beats too long. Then again he isnt exactly making The Suffragette here. Hes making a Blake Lively shark movie and he knows precisely which side his bread is cocoa-buttered on. Nancy meets a couple of local surfers armed with Go Pro cameras (which like her med-school skills will come in handy later) and hangs ten until they call it a day leaving her all alone in the middle of nowhere. And thats when the dinner bell gets rung. A 20-foot man-eating shark knocks Nancy off her surfboard and bites a deep gash into her leg leaving her huddled for survival on a tiny rock outcropping thats getting smaller and more precarious by the hour as the tide comes in. Nancys just 200 yards from the shore but it might as well be 200 miles while the shark circles her like a hungry man waiting for his TV dinner to be done in the microwave. The clock is ticking and all Nancy has is her wits a silly knack for speaking her thoughts aloud and a wounded seagull companion (played by Sully ""Steven"" Seagull according to the end credits) who becomes her lifeline to sanity -- her Wilson the volleyball. He may also be the most charismatic on-screen costar Livelys ever had. The Shallows wants to be the actress 127 Hours or All Is Lost but its really just a goosed-up slice of drive-in exploitation about an easy-on-the-eyes woman in peril. Its also unintentionally hilarious as everything that can go wrong does foiling Nancys MacGyver plans at every turn. Youre not exactly rooting for the shark but youre not really rooting against it either.  Clocking in at a svelte 87 minutes the film knows it audience and the limits of that audiences patience with fare like this. Still Collet-Serra and writer Anthony Jaswinski could have red-penciled some of Livelys sillier lines while amping up the carnage. The film is so restrained that I wish theyd gone all-in and splurged for an R rating. At one point a wino sleeping off a bender on the beach tries to swim out to steal her loose surfboard and instead of watching him get chomped into human chum the camera lingers on Livelys face for her reaction to the horror. She simply doesnt have the skill to pull it off and you end up feeling cheated. The sad part is The Shallows could have been a really fun B-movie. And in a lot of ways it is. Theres no denying that it has some great jump-scares and scratches a certain summer itch we all get this time of year. Too bad its a bit too watered down.

A shark becomes obsessed with a bikini-clad Blake Lively. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Running Time 127) PG-13 Bloody images intense sequences of peril and brief strong language. Area Theaters. Just in time for summer beach season Blake Lively is facing a killer shark in a new thriller. In ""The Shallows"" opening Friday Lively plays medical student Nancy Adams from Galveston Texas who travels to a secret beach in Mexico -- a special place where her late mother surfed. After a great day of riding the waves Nancy comes across the feeding ground of Great White shark that leaves her stranded on a rock with no way of getting ashore. Theres a long history of shark thrillers and you cant get a much better blueprint (or movie) than Steven Spielbergs 1975 classic ""Jaws."" Since then plenty of others have tried to make killer shark movies as scary and relevant with few of them succeeding ... depending on how you feel about Syfys ""Sharknado"" movies. Blake Lively takes a bite out of the shark thriller genre with ""The Shallows."" (Vince Valitutti/Stills Photography by Vince Vali) ""The Shallows"" doesnt try to reinvent the wheel or surpass ""Jaws"" because its more about a woman trying to survive on her own against the elements. Its a genre film that tries to be classier than shark movies tend to be even as it uses many of the same beats and visuals weve seen before. Hey Blake Lively heres the RIGHT way to evade a shark Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra a more than capable filmmaker of thrillers like ""Orphan"" and ""Non-Stop"" the film spends much of its time with gorgeous shots of the blue ocean off the Mexican coast -- and just as many of Blake Lively in various states of peril and undress. ""The Shallows"" doesnt try to reinvent the wheel or surpass ""Jaws"" because its more about a woman trying to survive on her own against the elements. (Columbia Pictures) Despite the genre and setting this is still very much a performance piece and Lively is more than just a pretty face and bikini bod. She has to do a lot with very little to work with other than a scene-stealing seagull. (Theres a point in the movie where you might be more worried about it being eaten by the shark.) Over the course of the film shes put through a rigorous ordeal that involves an ugly shark bite thats not for the squeamish and getting banged around quite a bit while trying to avoid worse. The shark itself isnt shown all that much the director going more for the ""sharks eye view"" to build suspense but when it does appear its an impressive sight. Theres plenty of shots of Lively in a bikini to keep some audience-members interest between shark scenes. (Vince Valitutti/Stills Photography by Vince Vali) The PG-13 rating might seem limiting for those expecting the type of gore one normally gets when a sharks involved but it goes pretty far to push the limit of that rating. Even with all the good things going for ""The Shallows"" its still only as interesting as watching a bikini-clad Blake Lively standing on a rock for 70 or so minutes. Some people might be fine with that but others might hope to get more than exactly whats shown in the trailer. ""The Shallows"" isnt bad as much-needed escapist summer fun but compared to other more memorable shark thrillers there just isnt enough bite.

And while ""Jaws"" transcended its genre trappings to become art ""The Shallows"" is a rousing effective B-movie and thats an art in and of itself. Director Jaume Collet-Serra isnt a household name -- in most non-Catalan-speaking households anyway -- but hes a modern master of popcorn thrills. From the oh-no-you-didnt twist of ""Orphan"" and the shameless horror of the ""House of Wax"" remake to Liam Neesons best post-""Taken"" movies (""Unknown"" ""Non-Stop"" ""Run All Night"") Collet-Serra may not be bucking for an Oscar but he certainly knows how to make moviegoers grab their armrests. See Video Watch Blake Lively Battle a Great White Shark in The Shallows Trailer His action chops are cemented with ""The Shallows"" which takes one of todays most misbegotten combos -- the PG-13 horror movie -- and wrings it for every drop of suspense he can find. The movie is not going to make anyone forget ""Jaws"" but it delivers the kind of breathless tension that justifies its existence. Blake Lively stars as Nancy a med-school dropout who has hitchhiked her way to a remote beach in Mexico that she last visited as an embryo in her mothers tummy. Its an idyllic location far off the grid -- even the locals wont tell this gringa tourist the name of the place lest she spoil it -- that offers perfect curls for Nancy to surf. Also Read Finding Dory to Drown Out Independence Day Resurgence at the Box Office She meets a pair of fellow surfers (Angelo Josue Lozano Corzo and Jose Manuel Trujillo Salas) but after they swim to shore Nancy decides to catch just one more wave. Alone in the sea shes surprised by the appearance of a pod of dolphins and then notices that theyre swimming out to a giant floating whale carcass. Unfortunately for her that whale is also a great white sharks dinner and shes just made herself a garnish to the main course. The receding tide reveals a small rock where Nancy avoids the shark -- and has to use her medical know-how to stitch together a gash on her leg -- but it will take all her ingenuity and will power to figure out how to make it back to the beach without getting chomped. ""The Shallows"" offers a basic set-up in a confined space -- one imagines a double-bill with ""Buried"" starring Livelys husband Ryan Reynolds -- and Collet-Serra and screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski (""Satanic"") work every angle of suspense from the time left before the tide goes back out to the frustrating nearness of the shore. Its like a cross between ""127 Hours"" and ""Open Water"" with rescue tantalizingly close and yet seemingly unreachable. Jaswinski gives us just enough backstory on Nancy -- she quit med school will she quit trying to survive the shark? -- and the script and direction balance the moments of relative calm with attacks and danger. Editor Joel Negron (""The Nice Guys"") will keep you clenched and even composer Marco Beltrami whose work usually gets in the way of the action nicely underscores Nancys plight. Also Read Blake Lively Defends Her Oakland Booty Remark I Was Celebrating My Body Lively appears in practically every shot of the film and even if Collet-Serra and cinematographer Flavio Martinez Labiano (""The Gunman"") spend a little too much time accentuating her wet-suit cleavage and arching back in the early sequences the actress ditches her surfer-girl glamour as the story moves along. She eloquently conveys panic and control fear and perseverance throughout and by the end theres something about her bikini-clad not-gonna-take-it-anymore demeanor that suggests the heroines of countless 1970s drive-in features and TV movies-of-the-week that stoked the imagination of a young Quentin Tarantino. ""The Shallows"" isnt one for the ages but its a skillful diversion for summertime moviegoers and will no doubt make a popular slumber-party scare generator particularly for those close to a coastline.

David Ehrlich Jun 23 2016 900 am davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""The Shallows"" As Jean-Luc Godard famously never said ""All you need for a movie is a girl and a great white shark."" What ""The Shallows"" presupposes is that adding a cute seagull a rotting whale and a few GoPro cameras to the mix probably wouldnt hurt. Unequivocally the best shark movie since ""Jaws"" (yes even better than ""Open Water"" and ""Deep Blue Sea"") this back-to-basics thriller either eliminates or reclaims all of the excess and gimmickry that have watered down the genre since Steven Spielberg first invented it -- theres only one killer fish shes shot in beautiful 2D and it doesnt appear as though the beast has developed the ability to swim backwards as the result of reckless genetic modifications. The film flirts with found-footage but only in small and supremely effective doses; the shark is a digital effect but a glorious one whose artificiality is only clear in a few crucial shots towards the end. With ""The Shallows"" Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra (""Non-Stop"" ""Orphan"") finally earns the cult thats been champing at the bit to praise his recent work. Nancy Adams (Blake Lively in the most convincing argument for her stardom since 2009s ""The Private Lives of Pippa Lee"") is a med school dropout with nothing to lose beyond her surfboard and her cell phone. Introduced as shes being driven to the secret Mexican beach that her late mother visited when Nancy was in utero our glassy-eyed Galveston girl is on a solo mission to commune with her past and make sense of the loss that continues to haunt her. Its an unformed and ill-advised plan motivated only by the emotional logic of helplessness -- whats the point of becoming a doctor if you cant save your mom from cancer? Whats the point of living if every road ends in death? That might sound like a rhetorical question but nothing inspires an answer quite like a prehistoric killing machine that doesnt give a soggy fuck about your grieving process. READ MORE Blake Lively Says Woody Allens New Movie Is Empowering To Women Budgeted at a relatively tight 17 million ""The Shallows"" knows that a movie only needs one shark if it packs a strong enough bite. Far more focused on suspense than scares the film balances the crowd-pleasing thrills of a true summer blockbuster with the patience and painterliness of less disposable entertainments. The build-up to the sharks beautiful first appearance (which chums the water with two Mexican surfing bros who give Nancy a hard time) is masterful stuff as Collet-Serra lingers on Flavio Labianos gorgeous ocean cinematography and subtly ingrains the films geography into our minds eyes. No it doesnt take a cartographer to appreciate the relationship between the shore and the jagged rock -- some 200 yards out to sea and completely submerged during high tide -- on which Nancy will have to huddle for dear life after the great white takes a bite out of her leg but Collet-Serra ensures that we feel the risk of every stroke between his heroine and her safety. The action is visceral and immediate but crucially contextualized by a helpful array of wide shots and birds-eye views. It helps that so much of this savage duel between woman and shark is rooted in a believable physical reality. Lively throws every inch of her long frame into the role; the camera inevitably eyes her like a piece of meat (all the better to appreciate the sharks POV) but the actress manages to carry the whole movie on one leg fending off all sorts of hungry looks as she blossoms into a soulful female MacGyver. Coral jellyfish and the rotting husk of a dead whale all play key roles; at one point Collet-Serra turns a buoy into its own location exploiting every possible use for the bobbing metal beacon in a way that recalls the joy of watching Jackie Chan make the most of his battle props. Best of all is how the movie elevates one of its decorative touches -- a stranded seagull with a broken wing -- into a bonafide supporting character (like Wilson the volleyball but cuter). The bird is such a delightful screen presence that ""The Shallows"" could do for seagulls what ""City Slickers"" did for calves; at the very least youll be a little more forgiving the next time one of those flying squawk monsters shits on you at the beach. Collet-Serra isnt in the business of making high art but his trash is crafted with a degree of care and cohesion thats lacking from many of Hollywoods proudest awards fare. ""The Shallows"" is a modest film even for a late June diversion but -- with the exception of a limp coda and a few inelegantly framed text conversations -- this thing is all killer and no filler. Nancys ordeal may not pack the same gravitas as other recent genre movies about death (""The Babadook"" springs to mind) but the shark is less a metaphor for grief than it is a mega-ton argument against giving into it. Were all helpless in the long run but that doesnt mean we cant save ourselves. Grade B+ ""The Shallows"" opens in theaters on Friday.

All these movies do is make sharks look bad and then fuels fears of sharks that are not only unfounded but untrue. Reply Yamaka June 24 2016 1118 am Eh I dont think Lively is the worst actress ever but shes an incredibly not good actress. She always sounds like her mouth is full of marbles which is distracting in every single role. Reply Mike Generosa July 1 2016 941 am My experience of this movie was to be in a constant state of annoyance it seems every third shot is stopped stuttered slowed the movie is a stream of jump cuts and crescendo music cues and over-mixed pounding sound effects. Do the filmmakers have any confidence in an audience that with have an attention-span longer than a flea? No. Its a really dumb movie through and through -- surely they could have TRIED to give the character more of a back story than that she is trying to emulate the ""fight"" of her deceased mother. Its manipulation of the audience in the laziest way. Believeable physical reality? The behavior of the shark has little resemblance to the actual behavior of sharks Its silly. I laughed outloud at the climax and I wasnt the only one. Jaws? Jaws is a great novel compared to this and it steals from Jaws shamelessly. July 1 2016 at 932 AM Publish Reply john July 16 2016 1053 pm Did you notice how the waited for a few monster waves to come to surf on in a Caribbean setting? Then it would be completely calm including the whole time she was ""trapped"" Reply john July 16 2016 1050 pm I am not a huge movie-goer but this is perhaps the worst flick Ive ever seen. Positives are a hot chickinteresting photography of surfing from underneath. Beyond that its idiotic and may become a cult-classic because its laughably stupid and even has a flaming shark scene. Reply Moviebuff69 July 22 2016 214 am Sad attempt and sad to compare this crap to Jaws Reply Thismoviesuckedbad July 22 2016 216 am absolute garbage waste of time and no shark would kill itself chasing a chick holding an chain attached to some weight.

It doesnt have the depth of ""Jaws"" which was anchored by three great actors and a trio of fleshed-out characters. Nor does it have the waves of creepy horror that washed over ""Open Water"" or the comic currents of the original ""Piranha."" But even staying at the kiddie end of the pool it provides plenty of thrills surprising flashes of beauty and a game performance by Blake Lively as the chummy surfer who refuses to become chum. MORE The Jersey Jaws of 1916 Sure its a B-movie. But in an era when other B-movies painfully strive to become blockbusters ""The Shallows"" knows what it is and what it needs to be. It has no cast of slumming Shakespearean actors or dreams of franchise. Its unashamed to deliver sleek summer entertainment. Credit director Jaume Collet-Sera for some of that. The stylish Spaniard has always had a better eye for images than a head for stories (and this script takes some awkward twists). But as he showed in ""Orphan"" ""Unknown"" and ""Run All Night"" he can fill the screen. But give even more credit to Lively. Her perpetually sunny attitude and privileged blonde good looks have made her a target for online snark like a millennial Gwyneth Paltrow. Only those who bothered to watch her work in ""The Town"" or ""The Age of Adaline"" knew better. Lively can act and she does a good job with a very difficult role here - holding our interest and sympathy for a feature-length movie with no one to talk to for most of it. (And unless the effects are better than they seems to be shes also a solidly athletic performer.) The set up is as high-concept simple as it gets On a deserted beach Livelys Nancy decides to catch one last wave before the sun sets. A shark catches her instead. Bleeding badly she manages to paddle to a craggy rock. She continues to bleed. The shark continues to circle. This does not look like its going to end well. But Lively keeps us watching and Collet-Sera keeps our attention - although frankly at first he tries too hard. We get that Nancy is wedded to her smartphone. But before she gets in the water every text she sends appears on the screen every chat throws up an image. It crowds our eyes with stuff and only serves as a distraction. Luckily for us Nancy leaves her phone on the beach once she goes into the water. And we go with her as the now stripped-down film details just how you survive a shark attack (Hint As in everything the right jewelry is essential.) The film isnt completely smooth going. Anthony Jaswinskis script occasionally introduces a few problems. (Im not sure many twenty-somethings still say ""gnarly"" or make Steven Seagal jokes.) Although the shark is fine some of the other effects look fake and the climax isnt nearly as clear or smart as the filmmakers think. But although theres a slight sadism to the filmmaking - Collet-Saura seems to give us many lingering loving closeups of Lively early only so that he can bash her about later - the action sequences are full of sweaty tension. The seascapes (Australia standing in for Mexico) are gorgeous. Lively is lovely and warm. And in a summer full of toothless adventures this movie - sorry - has bite. Ratings note The film contains gory violence and strong language. The Shallows (PG-13) Sony (87 min.) (PG-13) Directed by Jaume Collet-Sera. With Blake Lively. Now playing in New Jersey.
