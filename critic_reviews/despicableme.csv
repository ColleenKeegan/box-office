But while forthcoming Will Ferrell/Brad Pitt vehicle Megamind promises to be an all-out satirical assault on comic-book cliche Despicable Me is a cosy old-fashioned affair eschewing the current fashion for smug Shrek-style cynicism in favour of a cockle-warming redemption story. Steve Carell is the voice of Gru a suburban supervillain whose seemingly innocuous wood-frame semi sits above a vast underground lair populated by hordes of spiky yellow and predictably braindead minions. As befits a family-friendly baddie Grus acts of evil extend to freeze-raying passers-by and attempting to steal the moon rather than actual abduction or murder. Which means that when he adopts three adorable tow-headed orphan girls - for purposes of subterfuge too convoluted to go into here - its not long before their plucky charm and winning optimism begin to melt his cold cold heart. Characterisation is the movies strong suit Carells bizarre mittel-European accent threatens to make Gru a tough sell but when his three well-defined and loveable charges enter the picture this irascible prickly exterior becomes more transparent. Theres solid support too Russell Brand goes full cockernee as techno-wizard Dr Nefarious while Julie Andrews makes a brief but memorable turn as Grus domineering mother. What the film lacks ironically is a decent bad guy Jason Segel s preening Bill Gates-inspired Vector is more annoying than evil and while Will Arnett makes an impression as Mr Perkins president of the Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers) his character is frustratingly underexplored.As a US production written and directed by a team of Spaniards and Frenchmen Despicable Me has an agreeable mid-Atlantic feel its style sitting somewhere between Bolt and Belleville Rendez-Vous. With visits to Paris the Pyramids and the moon the films plot may be a little overcrowded but that doesnt prevent Despicable Me from being one of the years most likeable family entertainments.

""Despicable Me""aEUR(tm)s a great animation with good story - easy for children (and adults) to follow. ItaEUR(tm)s clear from the outset whoaEUR(tm)s good and whoaEUR(tm)s bad and the general direction of the story is well signposted and not taxing for kids. I wasnaEUR(tm)t overly impressed with the 3d - itaEUR(tm)s very good but itaEUR(tm)s not excellent - itaEUR(tm)s blurry in places. What I enjoyed was the attention to detail - though thereaEUR(tm)s plenty of humour kids would enjoy thereaEUR(tm)s an abundance of excellent adult humour and one-liners - something PixaraEUR(tm)s always concentrated on. I agree with the comment that thereaEUR(tm)s no one character in this movie thataEUR(tm)s particularly evil. ItaEUR(tm)s clear to see from the outset that Gru will be won over by the three little girls. What made me howl with laughter was the bedtime story from the pop-up book with the kittens inside and GruaEUR(tm)s reluctance to soften and tell the story properly. His space suit that turns pink in the washing machine because he put it in the same wash as the girlaEUR(tm)s ballet dresses is a fine example of attention to detail and humour in this movie. Ditto one of the little minions floats off into space early in the story having drunk a helium drink - something thataEUR(tm)s occasionally noted later the story and causes quite a few chuckles. Unlike PixaraEUR(tm)s ""Up"" I reckon ""Despicable Me"" probably wonaEUR(tm)t get nominated for an Oscar for best animation but as a story I liked it far far more - ""Up"" was cliched - even for kids.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 08 2010 219PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Despicable Me Directed by Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin Written by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio Starring Steve Carell Jason Segel Julie Andrews Classification PG Any kids flick called Despicable Me has won over subversive me right from the title. There it is a Latinate word with more syllables than little Johnny has birthdays stuck up on the marquee just daring the tykes to understand. But it gets riskier still How about a plot where every adult character is a villain and the ugliest one doubles as the main protagonist? Then risky gets clever when the titles linguistic mouthful is followed by a ""cast of minions"" who speak no language at all communicating just through strange squeaky emissions that nevertheless are delightfully nuanced and perfectly understandable. The effect is Chaplinesque if Chaplin had the latest in gadgetry because the entire picture is also shot in 3-D that for once puts all 3 of the Ds to imaginative use. Now consider that the risks and the cleverness and the imagination pay rich dividends factor in a climactic sight gag accessible enough to have the kiddies giggling yet literate enough to leave grad students smiling and the urge is irresistible Roll out the stars one for each deliciously despicable syllable. This animated thing pretty near out-Pixars Pixar. Lets start with the beaky-nosed slope-shouldered round-bellied spindly-legged black-clad nasty who (courtesy of Steve Carells vocal ingenuity) speaks in an accent that seems to have bubbled up from some Eastern European bog. That would be Gru and you might have guessed Gru aint good. More surprising is the sad fact that Gru isnt half as bad as he wants to be. Younger and more tech-savvy baddies like the upstart Vector (Jason Segel) have pushed him far down the villains depth chart. Worse theres still the competition from such classic miscreants as the mean-minded Miss Hattie at the childrens orphanage or the sleazy CEO of the ""Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers)"" whos refusing to float him any more loans for his nefarious schemes. Well eager to get his rep back whats a Gru to do but shoot for the moon. Literally shoot the moon with a ""shrink-ray machine"" thereby reducing it to the size of a baseball that can be secreted away in a proud super-villains pocket. The catch? The machine must first be stolen from Vectors lair. The solution? Too convoluted to dwell on but it involves adopting a trio of orphaned sisters - the eldest Margot the rambunctious Edith and the heartbreakingly naive Agnes - from Miss Hatties cruel establishment. These plot twists allow for a couple of time-honoured consequences popular in childrens tales. One is visual All that shrink-ray stuff lets co-directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin have lots of fun playing with Swiftian shifts in perspective. And the other is emotional. Needing to curry the favour of the orphans Gru must pretend to do what harried moms and dads are obliged to do - act like a caring parent. The three bully him into reading them bedtime stories into going to their damn dance classes into riding the roller coaster at the amusement park. Great 3-D effects on that coaster but even better is the old-fashioned 2-D humour throughout. Gru is a crotchety touchstone for those times when parenthood is less a joy than a burden. So in these sequences the kids in the audience are laughing at him and the adults are laughing with him - we have seen the villain and he is us. Still the guy is not without allies. Down in the basement of his Gothic hideout those loyal minions are ready to advance his dark designs. Happily they themselves are light and bright - yellow fellows shaped like pincushions sporting spiky hair and blue overalls and goggles covering their lone eye (actually a lucky few have two). Burbling away in their squeak-speak the minions are an adventurous sarcastic curious shrewd and trouble-loving horde of scene-stealers indefatigable even through the closing credits where several of them band together to send up all those awful 3-D flicks from days past - yep they stick it to us. As for the awful Gru dont be too hard on him. A few quick flashbacks reveal his own tortured childhood cursed with one of those constantly belittling mothers (Julie Andrews no less) who upon hearing her boys wish to be an astronaut snaps back ""Youre too late - NASA isnt sending monkeys any more."" No wonder he now wants the moon. Which brings us to that climactic sight way up in the stratosphere where vice is softening into virtue and a mistreated son is evolving into a kindly father. There clinging to the outside of a wayward spacecraft the orphans are in jeopardy and from amidst this superfluity of villains a hero finally emerges urging the children to jump from their precarious perch into his waiting arms. At that lovely moment who else is he than an airborne Holden Caulfield trading in his despicable past for a lofty future as The Catcher in the Sky.

Plus - stop the presses - the 3-D doesnt feel like a tacked-on afterthought gimmick.The despicable one is Gru (Steve Carell trying out an Eastern European accent mixed with hip-hop patois) who looks like an overweight kid swallowed by a particularly sad shark. Gru feels a desperate need to be dastardly and mean an ambition met on a small scale through everyday pettiness and on a large one through a series of heists (biggest score so far the Times Square Jumbotron which gives this Universal release the chance to flash the peacock logo of scion NBC). Now with the help of his ""minions"" an army of hyper squeaky little yellow stubs in overalls hes literally ready to shoot for the moon. First he needs a shrink ray because the moon in pretty big. To get the ray he must invade the heavily guarded palace of rival villain Vector (Jason Segel). To do that he needs the help of three adorable orphans who sell Vector his Girl Scout cookies. So yeah its a story about innocent kids turning a bad guy good. Dont let that fool you; Despicable Me keeps the cloying to a minimum without sacrificing the warm fuzzies.The movie directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud rides a poppy retro sensibility that should trigger parental nostalgia and tickle the youngsters that dont care so much about stylistic influence. The Gru-Vector showdowns have a taste of Mad magazines classic ""Spy vs. Spy"" strip; Grus house complete with iron maiden and small snaggletooth dog could have popped out of a Charles Addams cartoon. (Come to think of it same with Gru). The whole enterprise feels like controlled chaos As things grow more manic and illogical - lets not think about what might happen if you pulled the moon from the sky and held it in your hand - the more assured Despicable Me gets.You still need an emotional anchor to go with the sound and fury and Despicable delivers with its three-kids-and-a-grouch setup. You probably wont experience Toy Story 3 tear geysers but Grus minimal back story featuring an impossible-to-please mom (Julie Andrews as the anti-Mary Poppins) is enough to give him just the right dab of heft. It doesnt hurt that the tykes voiced by Miranda Cosgrove Elsie Fisher and Dana Gaier are indeed adorable.Grus nose like the tip of his self-designed spaceship ends at a jagged point and both have a way of sticking out over the audience to show off the nicely integrated 3-D effects. Some of the visuals are a bit more spectacular Driving down a curvy mountain road that looks an awful lot like the Big Sur section of Californias Highway 1 the bad guy and the nice girls come upon an amusement park that springs out of nowhere as if in a dream. Gru thinks he can ditch his charges there; instead he joins them on a roller-coaster ride that puts a little hitch in the viewers stomach. The moment is giddy and thrilling a contained argument for what 3-D can do when applied with the right level of craft and care.Despicable Me doesnt quite have the depth to operate on Pixars level but to be fair nothing does. It does exude skill heart and energy a combination hard to beat in animation or live action. Even when Gru commits random acts of evil including one wed all like to try in line at Starbucks he embraces the life of a bad guy with joie de vivre. The movie like the minions just has to follow his lead.Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris RenaudStarring The voices of Steve Carell Jason Segel Miranda Cosgrove Elsie Fisher Dana Gaier Russell Brand Julie Andrews Kristen Wiig and Will ArnettRun time 95 minutesMPAA rating PG (cartoon action mildly crude humor) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 9 2010 Save for later Saved In this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Gru voiced by Steve Carell tells his minions about their new mission to steal the moon in the 3-D CGI feature Despicable Me about a villain who meets his match in three little girls. Universal Pictures - Illumination Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In the pretty good new 3-D animated comedy ""Despicable Me"" Steve Carrell provides the voice for Gru a bald-pated bad guy with an unplaceable Eastern European accent who in best Scrooge-like fashion becomes a good guy. Carrell has stated in interviews that his accent ""falls someplace between Bela Lugosi and Ricardo Montalban"" and thats about right.Gru wants to first shrink and then steal the moon. To do this he needs to abscond with the shrink-ray gun owned by his archenemy Vector (voiced by Jason Segel). As backup Gru adopts three little orphan girls. (Thus begins the Scrooge reformation.)The visual wit almost always trumps the verbal. One exception One of the little girls complains ""When we got adopted by a bald guy I thought this would be a lot more like Annie. "" Its too bad this film comes so soon after ""Toy Story 3"" - thats a tough animated act to follow. Grade B (Rated PG for rude humor and mild action.)

He means to be the biggest villain in the world in fact but hes not very good at villainy. And hes got competition. So Gru voiced in the agreeably offbeat new animated comedy Despicable Me by Steve Carell gets no respect not even from his mom (Julie Andrews) who calls him in his jet-car when she hears about the theft of one of the great pyramids of Egypt. Supposedly shes phoning to congratulate him -- but really shes reaching out to touch a sore spot (it wasnt Grus caper) and torment her offspring with the fact that someones a more successful villain than he is. Grus evil plans are nonetheless plenty big. Also inordinately complicated involving shrink rays bank loans rockets and most of all minions. Hes got hundreds of chattering little minions -- odd little helpers who look like really big smiling yellow pills -- and who cheerfully do their thoroughly misguided best to help Gru. This being an animated comedy the results are usually not quite what he intended and often they spell disaster for at least a few of their minion buddies. For reasons complicated enough that youll want to discover them for yourself Gru also gets involved with three little orphan girls; technically he adopts them but practically speaking theyre in control even when hes making the rules. i Pick Me Pick Me Much of the humor in Despicable Me is derived from these little corn puff-shaped creatures and their ill-fated attempts at mischief. hide caption toggle caption Pick Me Pick Me Much of the humor in Despicable Me is derived from these little corn puff-shaped creatures and their ill-fated attempts at mischief. Its all thoroughly adorable and with an overlay thats nearly as odd as Carells accent Despicable Me looks a lot like other computer-animated pictures -- white picket fence suburbs rounded characters sleek and modern but with a retro afterglow. Gru and his minions deploy all manner of weird contraptions -- that jet-car which looks sort of steam-powered; cookie robots that skitter like insects -- as if Jules Verne somehow got into the Pixar toolbox. The film does come from a French animation studio so it makes sense that it would feel a little different. Also that the storytelling would take some unexpected turns -- villains with mommy issues and daddy trouble shout-outs to Jaws and Spy vs. Spy. There are some tricky visual turns too including a ride on a roller coaster that if you see it in 3-D will give you vertigo for sure. And dont leave when the end credits start or youll miss the minions doing a nifty little deconstruction of 3-D. Judging from the mishaps that befall them during the picture Id have said these little yellow dudes were kinda dim but they establish while the credits roll that they understand 3-D a heck of a lot better than the folks who made The Last Airbender or Clash of the Titans. Maybe they should try their little minion hands at directing.

"Movie review In Steve Carells Despicable Me evil was never so heartwarming washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Despicable Me Movie review In Steve Carells Despicable Me evil was never so heartwarming Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 9 2010 I cannot lie I spent the first several minutes of ""Despicable Me"" squirming uncomfortably never laughing and barely cracking a smile. The nasty streak that animates its protagonist a hollow-eyed supervillain named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) is so deep and wide as to seem insurmountable. But hang in there and ""Despicable Me"" turns into an improbably heartwarming not to mention visually delightful diversion. After another evildoer impresses the world by stealing the Great Pyramid of Giza Gru looks for his big comeback and hits on the idea of stealing the moon. He adopts three sweet girls from an orphanage run by a sadistic Southern belle (Kristen Wiig) and along with an army of tiny yellow ""minions"" begins to bring his plan into action. (Those minions by the way pretty much steal the movie much like the adorable singing slugs in ""Flushed Away."") Carell taking a page or two from Drs. Evil and Horrible (from ""Austin Powers"" and Joss Whedons ""Sing-Along Blog"" respectively) affects an indeterminate Slavic accent to play Gru but the expert timing is in full force as his character tries mightily to resist the parental tug his three young charges elicit. ""Despicable Me"" features some ace voice talent including Russell Brand Jason Segel and Will Arnett as the president of the Bank of Evil (""Formerly Lehman Brothers""). Directed by Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin the film boasts a stylized look inspired by Edward Gorey James Bond movies and Looney Tunes an aesthetic that manages to be retro and futuristic all at once. The action and laughs of the story make ""Despicable Me"" a terrific choice for families still on a high from ""Toy Story 3"" but it deserves even more credit for its elegant visual design and use of 3-D which here looks crisp and bright and provides genuine visual excitement. A roller-coaster ride set to a sprightly tune by Pharrell Williams makes the most of an element that seems tacked on in so many movies lately. Filmgoers are also urged to hang around for the closing credits which feature 3-D stunts reminiscent of the good old ""House of Wax"" days. As ""Despicable Me"" proves showmanship counts whether youre trying to rule the world or just the weekend summer box office.  PG. At area theaters. Contains rude humor and mild action. 94 minutes.

Photo ""Despicable Me"" may not be the most sophisticated kids movie ever but it stacks up against recent animated fare like ""How To Train Your Dragon"" the way The New York Review of Books compares to USA Today. ""The Incredibles"" gets turned inside out in this dazzlingly animated 3-D movie about battling super-villains scheming to steal the moon. All the while theyre dealing with buzzkill bureaucrats of paltry soul -- such as bank loan officers who refuse to finance dastardly schemes. Like ""The Incredibles"" ""Despicable Me"" uses a mock-60s-cartoon-hero score and saddles its protagonists with super-nuisances -- such as a dismissive French mom (Julie Andrews). In flashback she tells her young son at the time of the moon landing that hell never make it to outer space because ""NASA isnt sending monkeys anymore."" PHOTOS BEST ANIMATED MOVIES Despite such setbacks Steve Carells Russian-accented Dr. Gru is set on being ""the greatest willain uff all time."" He uses a freeze-ray to dispose of everyone whos ahead of him in the line at the coffee bar decorates his Charles Addams-style horror-house with a panda-skin rug and drives a spaceship-size vehicle that rams the other cars out of the way. All of this makes him a happy psychopath but when he learns that a rival madman has stolen the Great Pyramids his only riposte is ""I stole the Statue of Liberty The little one from Las Vegas."" Gru has a big idea to get back in the malice game -- a shrink-ray that will enable him to capture the moon. But in these liquidity-starved times hes short of operating funds. So he seeks out a loan in an imposing building marked ""Bank of Evil -- Formerly Lehman Brothers."" (Among other smart jokes theres also a scientist voiced by Russell Brand called Dr. Nefario and a dead-on satiric attack on one of the worlds least-remarked-upon sources of evil -- baby books.) Though ""Despicable Me"" is a little ragged on story (which is so simple that many detours to amusement parks and such are required to get us up to the 90-minute mark) its got a lot of imagination and a heart as warm as a fluffy kitty. Most of this comes from three little orphan girls whom Gru adopts because the cookies they sell door-to-door are the only method that will gain him entrance to the egg-shaped lair of his cookie-loving archnemesis Vector (the vocally undistinguished Jason Segel). Vectors a geek who has tricked out his HQ with a variety of hilarious security gadgets that lead to some amusing antics seemingly inspired by the old ""Spy vs. Spy"" comics in Mad magazine. Gru puts his new daughters to sleep in hollowed-out bombs -- which make really cool beds a detail typical of how invitingly clever this movies imagination is. What toddler wouldnt love a daddy who leaves freeze-guns lying around the house? Or who has hundreds of rubbery mischief-loving squash-shaped knee-high minions who speak in an almost-English gobbledygook and who long to be kissed goodnight at bedtime? Still the kids carp ""I thought this would be more like Annie. "" Vector with his gadgets his glasses and his bangs seems styled after Bill Gates. Mr. Microsoft isnt the only loathed public figure the movie made me think of though. Grus pet is a tiny but ferocious ball of teeth and fur a piece of nastiness that loves to rip into everything in sight. Its name? Kyle.

"Despicable Me | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; despicable-me ) Despicable Me (United States 2010) July 08 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Seen in standard (non-IMAX) 3-D. 2010 has not been a vintage year for movies in general but it has been an uncommonly good year for animated films. With Toy Story 3 leading the way the latest crop of big screen animated fare has emphasized the adage that these cartoons arent just for kids. The dark horse - in more ways than one - in the 2010 summer animated derby is Universal Pictures Despicable Me and although the animated style isnt as crisp or enticing as that of Pixars Toy Story 3 or the Dreamworks duo of How to Train Your Dragon and Shrek 4 the movie has it where it counts in the heart and mind. This is a smartly written comedy with a soft emotional core. It doesnt tug at the heart strings with the force of Toy Story 3 but its nevertheless satisfying in an affecting way. Perhaps best of all this is a rare instance in which the 3-D while not an asset is at least not a detriment. If you want to pay the extra money to wear the glasses at least youre not being subjected to a subpar viewing experience. The lead character in Despicable Me is Gru (voice provided by Steve Carell) a Doctor Evil-type supervillain. Gru whose career exploits include pilfering the Times Square Jumbotron and the little Statue of Liberty in Las Vegas has lost his place atop the Bad Guys totem pole when an upstart named Vector (Jason Segel) comes along and snatches the Great Pyramid. Seething Gru and his scientist cohort Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) arrive at a convoluted scheme Gru will steal a shrinking ray from the scientists developing it build a rocket and use it on the moon. Problems develop when Vector outfoxes him swiping the shrinking ray instead then stashes it in a vault in his impregnable fortress. In order to retrieve the weapon Gru employs a Trojan Horse he adopts three little orphan girls - Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) - and has them enter Vectors lair by selling Girl Scout cookies. Some of those ""cookies"" are actually robots that facilitate Grus entrance. The pint-sized trio however prove to have a more formidable impact on their ""father"" than he could have imagined and he begins to contemplate attending their dance recital rather than rocketing into space. Yes the storyline for Despicable Me is preposterous but no more so than a movie in which toys come to life or in which animals talk. Like most animated films this one is less concerned about the primary narrative than it is about the witty asides sharp dialogue and building of relationships between the characters. Despicable Me starts out looking like its going to be a satire of James Bond-type supervillainy but ends up being a Valentine to fatherhood. The movie is less about whether Gru will outduel Vector in his quest to reclaim his 1 Villain position than it is about how his adoption of the three girls transforms him. The central theme of the movie is that the wide eyes of a child can melt even the coldest of hearts. The filmmakers recognize theres truth in that sentiment and understand that most viewers regardless of their age will respond to it. As with nearly every recent animated film Despicable Me includes slapstick cute sidekicks (in this case the oddly-shaped Minions) and asides that only adults will understand (""Bank of Evil -Formerly Lehman Brothers""). The film doesnt work as effectively on multiple levels as Toy Story 3 but it neither bores nor insults older viewers in the way too many live-action ""family films"" do. Its almost the complete package and only comes in third (thus far) in the 2010 animated sweepstakes because Toy Story 3 and How to Train a Dragon are so good. Despicable Mes look is relatively basic at least insofar as big-budget animated films are concerned although one of the concluding images (Gru dancing to the Bee Gees) is worth the price of admission. It lacks the rich detail and depth of color that characterize both the Dreamworks and Pixar productions. In a way this could be seen as an asset because it interferes less with the 3-D process. Despicable Me was developed with 3-D in mind and there are opportunities when the ""fourth wall"" is broken with objects flying off the screen at the audience. Still although the 3-D doesnt do much to enhance the viewing experience it is at least employed with a degree of proficiency. The voicework seems like a gathering of Judd Apatow actors and SNL alumni. The lead three - Steve Carell Jason Segel and Russell Brand - are known at least in part for their work with Apatow while Kristin Wiig (who plays the head of the girls school where the orphans live) and Will Arnett (as Vectors father) have their roots in Saturday Night Live. Miranda Cosgrove Carly from iCarly provides a popular voice that kids can relate to. And everyone knows Julie Andrews (as Grus mother). Brand and Carell show a Mike Myers-like versatility in what they do with their lines - one would never guess its them if their names didnt appear in the opening credits. Brand sounds more like Dr. Strangelove than himself and Carell appears to be doing a version of Bela Lugosi. (One almost expects him to say ""I never drinka| wine"" at some point although he doesnt.) Despicable Me represents Universals latest attempt to break into an animation field dominated by Pixar/Disney Dreamworks and (to a lesser extent) Fox. With the 2010 summer live-action roster showing so much weakness this presents an opportunity for Despicable Me which is receiving sufficient marketing and publicity to generate strong public awareness. More importantly its the kind of motion picture critics can get behind and a wide range of viewers will enjoy so theres no reason why this shouldnt become at worst a modest success.

Despicable Me fills that bill.(See the top 10 saddest kids movies.) Its the story of a world-class supervillain named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell in a fake menacing Eastern European accent) whose conception of evil is little-boy mischievousness. Yes he likes to torture kids -- say by popping their animal balloon with a pin -- but only after amusing them creating the animal balloon he intends to pop. And now as Gru tells his army of minions -- tiny goggled yellow marshmallow creatures who are loyal but not too bright -- he plans to steal the moon by shrinking it. Lately though hes been dwarfed in nastiness by dweebish young Vector (Jason Segel) who managed to swipe the Great Pyramid at Giza. Until Gru proves hes No. 1 the Bank of Evil wont give him a loan. So he adopts three orphan sisters to infiltrate Vectors laboratory on the pretense of selling him Girl Scout cookies. They of course are the adversaries he really has to worry about. While hes shooting and shrinking the moon they could find a villains heart and warm it. (See TIMEs Summer Entertainment Guide.) Even in this brief synopsis and even if youre a kid you will detect echoes in Gru of Dr. Seusss Grinch and a dozen other cartoon touchstones. The accent and comic-villain attitude are reminiscent of Boris Badenov and Snidely Whiplash from Jay Wards classic TV cartoon The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. (Vector is a snottier version of Mr. Peabodys boy Sherman.) The light impudence of the films wit harks back to Warner Bros. Looney Tunes as when a sign proclaims that the Bank of Evil is ""formerly Lehman Brothers."" (I would have loved it if the sign had said ""a.k.a. Goldman Sachs"" but satire when bankrolled by a major studio can go only so far.) The very word despicable is a tribute to Daffy the Warner cartoon duck who immortally mispronounced it in the 1951 Rabbit Fire. (""Youre dethpickable And and and pickable"") The movie marks Universal Studios first serious attempt to board the CGI-animation gravy train that has poured zillions into the coffers of Pixar DreamWorks and 20th Century Foxs Blue Sky -- the team that made the Ice Age movies and Horton Hears a Who. Chris Meledandri who supervised the Blue Sky unit is over at Universal now. With him he took Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul the Horton screenwriters to expand on an idea by Spanish animator Sergio Pablos. Meledandri handed the directing chores to Blue Sky veteran Chris Renaud and the French animator Pierre Coffin. The movie was developed by this Spanish-Franco-American team. That explains the movies Euro feel its lithe simplicity of line its occasionally noirish palette its pointy rather than round character shapes. Despicable Me has continental cousins -- the Czech animation style of the 1950s and 60s and from 2003 Sylvain Chomets Oscar-nominated The Triplets of Belleville -- at least as close as its more obvious American kin. For their graphic inspiration the filmmakers cite Charles Addams and Edward Gorey who are among the most European of comic draftsmen and Cuban artist Antonio Prohias Mad magazine series ""Spy vs. Spy."" (They might also have mentioned the Mad cartoonist Sergio Aragones and his comic-book barbarian ""Groo the Wanderer."") No wonder that in the central conflict of Gru vs. Vector -- essentially a replay of the Cold War arms race -- the sympathy goes not to the power-mad young American who seems like a deranged version of Bill Gates but to the old man with the Soviet-bloc voice and the Euro-couture of turtlenecks and jaunty scarves. Kids wont be frightened by the movie (rated PG for fart jokes) but they may take to heart the parent problems each of the main characters has to endure. Grus villainy is traced to a lifetime of lovelessness from his mother (Julie Andrews) so mean and demeaning shed turn any child into a monster. Vector has become an evil genius in an attempt to please his father. Neither can do much to improve their sad parental situations. Not so the orphans for whom Gru is their new adoptive daddy. Rather than charm the beast they pretty much hound him into a recognizably human form. They are the Whos to Grus Grinch and by the end of the movie its Christmas. This is an agreeable confection with a few soft spots. Carells singsong accent twists his dialogue amusingly by shouting in the middle of sentences but he also is stranded by wan retorts -- ""Oh come on"" ""You have got to be kidding me"" ""I hate that guy"" -- that the DreamWorks writing staff would have punched up with some vernacular sparkle. But whenever the plot goes limp Despicable Me falls back on the minions Grus geek chorus. Theyre the ones who cue the audience to the absurdity of their masters malevolence cheering when he shouts ""We stole the statue of Liberty"" then issuing a collective sigh of disappointment when he adds ""The small one from Las Vegas."" Like Skrat in the Ice Age movies or the penguins in Madagascar these adorable scene-stealers probably deserve their own spin-off feature. Universal may not have a franchise movie in this very pickable cartoon comedy but they certainly have franchise minions. See a photographic history of Pixar Read ""Is Shrek Bad for Kids?""

(Pixar) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 9 2010 400 AM Title Despicable Me Lets be honest Right now any excuse for air conditioning will do. So its a happy bonus to find that ""Despicable Me"" is more than just a heat-busting baby-sitter.Granted its a far cry from the Pixar classics. But Pierre Coffin and Chris Renauds nicely quirky animated comedy has just enough edge to entertain every member of the family.Much of the credit goes to Steve Carell who voices our anti-hero Gru. Once the worlds meanest villain Gru has recently been upstaged by new kid Vector (Jason Segel). Determined to revive his fading reputation Gru decides to shrink and then steal the moon. The first step in this plan requires him to invade Vectors lair a challenge he accomplishes by adopting three adorable orphans (Miranda Cosgrove Elsie Fisher Dana Gaier).Grus intention is to use the kids to get in nab Vectors shrink ray and dump the children back at the orphanage. But wouldnt you know it? Three little girls with a penchant for tutus will melt even the iciest villains heart.Dont get the idea this is purely sappy stuff however. Ken Daurio and Cinco Pauls screenplay goes into some daringly dark territory though they do struggle a bit to find the right balance between cynicism and sentimentality. Their script feels especially forced when they cant decide whether to amuse the grownups or pander to kids. (Expect some potty humor.)But everything eventually falls into place primarily because the actors bring the best jokes and most touching emotions to life. An unrecognizable Carell maintains a droll Eastern European accent while giving genuine depth to Grus transformation. And contributions from supporting castmates Russell Brand Will Arnett Julie Andrews and Kristen Wiig are hilariously on target.Its also hard to beat a movie that makes good use of the now-inevitable 3-D. Theres no game-changing technology on display here but the action is exciting enough to make you forget youre wearing silly plastic glasses. And when youve exhausted all other hot-weather activities that alone should be enough.

"Despicable Me movie review Despicable but not memorable |       NJ.com comments Despicable Me movie review Despicable but not memorable Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 09 2010 at 1208 AM View/Post Comments Universal Pictures and Illumination EntertainmentOne of the worlds greatest villains Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and his minions in ""Despicable Me.""Its sad when Public Enemy No. 1 slips to No. 2. Thats what Gru thinks anyway. He used to be one of the most fearsome super-villains around. But lately hes been surpassed by other meanies. In fact his regular loan officer at the Bank of Evil (""Formerly Lehman Brothers"" a sign says) just turned him down. Time to think big. Really big. Like maybe stealing the moon? Thats the start of ""Despicable Me"" and while its an interesting one -- there arent many cartoons told from the villains perspective -- the film while technically beautiful doesnt do enough with it. It literally needed to spend more time on the drawing board. Part of the problem is that this feels -- to be as polite as I can -- borrowed. Gru with his bald head and deep-set shadowed eyes is a near-dead ringer for Uncle Fester. And considering the (single) high point of ""The Addams Family"" musical had Fester proclaiming his love for the moon -- and even doing a dance with the orb -- this movie seems awfully familiar. Similarly unimaginative is Festers -- excuse me Grus -- elderly scientist assistant Dr. Nefario an ancient and nearsighted eccentric who seems to have wandered over from ""Futurama."" And the three orphan girls whom Gru adopts (for reasons of his own) and whose personalities boil down to Loves Unicorns Wears a Hat and Is Older. Movie Review Despicable Me (PG) Universal (88 min.) Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. With the voices of Steve Carell Russell Brand Jason Segel. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains violence and some mildly vulgar humor. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS Thats too bad because the artwork here is really lovely. (And the by-now ubiquitous 3D is very well done -- watch out for that roller-coaster ride.) Steve Carell -- who plays Gru with a vague Eastern European accent -- has just the right touch of exasperation and Russell Brand and Jason Segel are fun (and unrecognizable) as a Gru nemesis and Dr. Nefario. But if they are unrecognizable why hire them? Everyone loves Julie Andrews but why have her put on an accent and dub Grus Jewish mother from hell? Wouldnt we rather hear Julie Andrews? Or the distinctive voice of Danny McBride also buried in the cast and the sound mix? Pharrell Williams few songs are bouncy and the small children at the preview I attended laughed heartily at a few points particularly when Nefario misheard Grus request and built a weapon using noxious gas. (""I said DART gun"") But the final sequence doesnt build the way a Pixar or Aardman movie would and the whole thing is quickly forgettable. Its fine for a Saturday matinee particularly if youre feeling cooped up cant handle the Shore traffic -- and dont feel like seeing ""Toy Story 3"" again. But unfortunately ""Despicable Me"" is just predictably -- eh. And the one thing the larcenous Gru never steals is our heart.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Despicable Me Animation. Starring Steve Carell Russell Brand and Jason Segel. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It used to be that most animated features had about as much story as a 10-minute Warners short. The rest was filler - bits shtick impressive visuals a layering on transparent sentiment and a few wisecracks tossed over the kiddies heads to keep the parents awake. Animation has moved beyond that in recent years but ""Despicable Me"" represents a step back. Its not bad. It has its moments - they all have their moments - and the last half hour redeems the first hour somewhat. But when compared with the ambition and achievement of recent animated films such as ""Coraline"" and ""Toy Story 3"" ""Despicable Me"" hardly seems to have been worth making and its barely worth watching. Theres enough substance here for a charming 10 minutes or maybe a charming supersize 20. Steve Carell doing an Eastern European accent is the voice of Gru who definitely has a look flat bald head long pointy nose big wide body and very thin legs. Gru styles himself as the greatest villain in the world and he has a plan to steal the moon.

The film tells the story of one the worlds ... more Photo Universal Pictures Review Despicable Me 1 / 1 Back to Gallery But wait he has competition Theres an up-and-coming villain (the voice of Jason Segel) who also wants to steal the moon. And so we arrive at the central dramatic question Will Gru be able to maintain his status as worlds greatest villain? Do you see the problem with this already? As a plot conceit theres nothing in this to engage an audience. Obviously no one cares if this guy gets to remain as the worlds top bad guy. Nor is this situation inherently amusing in a character way or even interesting in a satirical or sardonic way. There is simply nothing here except a pretext for lots of labored slapstick spy-versus-spy type shenanigans between the two ""villains."" Twenty minutes into ""Despicable Me"" nothing has happened. The fake sentiment kicks in when Gru for reasons not worth going into adopts three little girls. At first of course he treats them with contempt but then gradually ... You could write this movie couldnt you? Youve seen it all before. ""Despicable Me"" is tedium in slow motion a train coming down a well-worn track doing 5 miles an hour. It gets better near the finish - it had better. An actual story with situations that flow and build from other situations kicks in after an hour and all the effects and innovations the movie was saving up come in at the end and its undeniably pleasurable. Theres also something to be said for the cute boxy yellow minions who are well drawn and funny and for Carell himself whose engaging spirit comes through his voice. Its curious to note that for flashes at a time Gru looks like Carell although its hard to see how thats possible. Either its an illusion created by Carells voice or something wonderfully subtle and sophisticated that the animators are doing with Grus face. The bottom line is because of the strong finish audiences are not likely to leave ""Despicable Me"" disappointed - unless they walk out in the middle.

Theyre the suburban California children of lesbian mothers and the brother Laser has decided to seek out the sperm donor who was instrumental in bringing them into the world. His sister Joni hesitates because she says ""that really could hurt Momss feelings."" Not Moms singular but Momss plural her blithely commonplace term for the pair of moms whove raised them to be normal American kids. The basic joke here and its a rich one is that the dynamics of gay marriages differ little from those of straight marriages. But that joke also serves as a catalyst for some startlingly beautiful considerations of age and youth family values and before and after everything else the value of family. ENLARGE From left Annette Bening Julianne Moore Josh Hutcherson Mia Wasikowska and Mark Ruffalo as a family with complications in ""The Kids Are All Right."" Focus Features The moms Nic and Jules are played to perfection by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore; Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska give a matched set of fine performances as their kids. Nic is older than Jules and an OB-GYN; shes the familys breadwinner. Jules is an L.A. work in progress a beautiful housewife whos been trying to find herself without straying too far from the house. Foreign-language films have subtitles; this film has subtexts that enhance every scene between the two women--unspoken anxieties insecurities vulnerabilities comical but corrosive hostilities. And if the language isnt literally foreign it constitutes a droll lexicon of current California-speak on such subjects as mulch composting heirloom tomatoes spiritual growth (Nic knows she hasnt been her highest self) and rabid adolescence. (""Spermsters a hottie"" a high-school classmate tells Joni.) The spermster in question is Paul the newly outed dad of Laser and Joni; hes played by Mark Ruffalo with an easy affability that covers great subtlety. A heedless kid when he sold his seed for artificial insemination 19 years ago Paul is now a successful restaurateur with an urban garden that provides fresh produce and prompts Nic to say earnestly ""Its so...indigenous."" This is more approval than she feels. Pauls sudden appearance in the bosom of her basically happy family represents an unwelcome surprise at best and a free-floating threat at worst. If the film has flaws they are minor ones A fraught friendship between Laser and a school buddy Clay seems like a sketch for another movie particularly because the relationship that emerges between Laser and Paul is so interesting and strong. The movies title carries echoes of Pete Townshends song but a Joni Mitchell song ""All I Want"" gives ""The Kids Are All Right"" a moment of pure magic. Thats when Nic singing it gleefully reveals not just a pop passion of her adolescence but vivid clues to who she has become. And at a time when a single magical moment is enough to make a movie exceptional this movie has several others. One of them also centers on Nic whose normally buoyant soul deflates visibly and anguishingly as the camera watches in a surreal semi- silence; its an immensely powerful piece of acting complemented by Ms. Cholodenkos astute direction. Another moment belongs to Ms. Wasikowska--a superb young actress--and its silent and fleeting nothing but Joni (who was named after the singer) alone in a room about to make a bed. Still another moment is a clear violation of a sound dramatic rule--show dont tell what the story is. But rules are swept away by Ms. Moores inspired performance when Jules stands up in front of the others toward the end to tell them what being a family means and what it demands. Gay marriage is a hot-button issue but ""The Kids Are All Right"" doesnt push buttons or advance an agenda. The film plays fair with love in its myriad forms and insists on the need for close and stable connections whatever the homes configuration may be; in that sense its almost conservative. The cast includes Yaya DaCosta as Tanya a stunning straight free-swinger whod be delighted to start a family; Zosia Mamet as Jonis sex-obsessed friend; and Joaquin Garrido as a sad-eyed ill-used Latino gardener. Igor Jadue-Lillo did the fine unfussy cinematography. Every good movie is a singular event; if it werent distinctive it wouldnt be good. Yet this summer has produced a fascinating trend thats starting to look like a genuine phenomenon--female American filmmakers using modest budgets and limited resources to turn out some of the best movies of the year. First it was Nicole Holofceners ""Please Give"" an urban celebration of empathy in flawlessly comic terms. Then came Debra Graniks ""Winters Bone"" an example of ethnography harnessed to a heart-stopping story with a fearless heroine. Now Ms. Cholodenko has joined the party with yet another terrific film that bears the indelible stamp of a woman and an American woman at that. ""Party"" may not be the right word though. Its starting to feel like a home-grown renaissance. The Girl Who Played With Fire ENLARGE Noomi Rapace as Stieg Larssons Lisbeth Salander in ""The Girl Who Played With Fire."" Music Box Films It has been only four months since the first of the ""Millennium Trilogy"" films burst upon us. These are the Swedish-language screen adaptations of the late Stieg Larssons remarkable crime novels starting with ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" Now the second film has arrived with a grittier sensibility thanks to a different set of filmmakers but with the same sensational star Noomi Rapace who continues to redefine our notions of a contemporary heroine. ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" which was directed by Daniel Alfredson from a screenplay by Jonas Frykberg doesnt have the nuances of its predecessor. Its more of a straight-ahead action saga although straight ahead is a better description of the hurtling pace than the convoluted plot which takes all sorts of twists and turns in the present while delving further into the tortured past of its heroine Lisbeth Salander. If youre resistant to extravagant melodrama or flat-out horror tropes you may find the film inferior to ""Dragon Tattoo."" For my own part I confess to enjoying the lurid stuff just as much as the dramatic intricacies that reflect the texture of the source. (At least some of the texture; whats decreasingly present in the screen adaptations is Mr. Larssons moral outrage at what he saw as modern societys pervasive corruption.) This time theres plenty of opportunity for lurid developments because Lisbeth suddenly accused of two murders is desperate to exonerate herself and shes up against some desperate characters. (One of them a brutal monster with bleached blond hair has a rare disease called congenital analgesia; he can feel no pain.) The shadowy connections between her various adversaries or torturers can be difficult to keep straight. Still everything makes sense apart from a few giddy leaps of logic and the commanding figure of Ms. Rapace always fills center stage. Just think of what shes asked to do--keep us constantly connected to a seethingly angry chain-smoking kick-boxing foul-mouthed bisexual Goth hacker with a history of violence that she frequently and ferociously updates. The actress gets immeasurable help from the writing Lisbeths anger is matched by her intelligence and her physical prowess which enables her to administer as well as absorb pain in megadoses. But none of it would register without Ms. Rapaces singular combination of eerie beauty and feral intensity. Shes a movie star unlike any other. Despicable Me ENLARGE Gru voiced by Steve Carell with some little minions in ""Despicable Me."" Universal/Everett Collection The inverted pyramid used to be a guiding principle of print journalists grab the readers attention by putting the best material at the top. ""Despicable Me"" (which involves the theft of a pyramid) inverts the principle. This animated feature from Universal Pictures is pretty thin at the top of the show but fills out as it goes along. And the animation is a grabber all the way through. Watch the trailer for the movie ""Despicable Me."" Video courtesy of Universal. The title--what a good one-- refers to the villainous hero Gru who does bad things for no good reason. (Well not quite. Like so many movie villains these days he could never get his mommys approval.) Gru may not have been responsible for the theft of the Great Pyramid; his much less interesting rival in global misconduct is a young comer named Vector. But he intends to steal the moon and that hints at the nature of the story. His so-called plan is such an arbitrary Saturday-morning-cartoonish notion that nothing of emotional consequence is at stake. Still Gru--voiced by Steve Carell by way of Bela Lugosi and looking like a fuller-faced relative of the food critic Anton Ego in ""Ratatouille""--is a funny guy. And he becomes a more interesting guy when he crosses paths with a trio of orphan girls who appoint him their father and melt his heart. The film was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud from a script by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul. It looks so stylish that thinking about its plot is strictly optional. DVD Focus Laurel Canyon (2002) ENLARGE none Theres a nice time-warpy quality to Lisa Cholodenkos second feature. Everyone in it is transformed either by life in the Los Angeles canyon of the title where a hippie culture survives in modern dress or by encounters with unlikely love objects. I wasnt transformed but I was transfixed by Frances McDormands sensational performance as Jane a pansexual record producer who cant suppress a nervous giggle when she introduces her psychiatrist son Sam (Christian Bale) to a gaggle of indolent musicians living in her house. Kate Beckinsale is Alex Sams scholarly fiancee and Natascha McElhone plays a lissome Israeli. High Art (1998) ENLARGE none Ms. Cholodenkos debut feature is slow-paced but interesting especially for the quality of the acting. The heroine Syd (Radha Mitchell) is an assistant editor at a photography magazine. When she discovers that her upstairs neighbor is a once-famous photographer named Lucy Berliner (a startling performance by Ally Sheedy) the sweet-faced Syd promptly falls in love--not just with Lucys shots but with the shooter and with the heroin hell in which Lucy has willfully and quite hopelessly lost herself. Patricia Clarkson is druggy Greta a German with Dietrichs voice and Fassbinders name on her lips. Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008) ENLARGE none Josh Hutcherson has matured appealingly since he played a scientists young nephew in Eric Brevigs entertaining update of the Jules Verne classic. Brendan Fraser is the scientist searching Iceland for traces of his vulcanologist brother who may have gone down a volcanic tube. Anita Briem as a beautiful Icelandic guide reveals a bright spirit and a gift for comedy that will stand her in good stead on the Earths surface. The film was shot in 3-D with a prototype of the camera that James Cameron used in ""Avatar."" Like most recent 3-D attractions though its no worse when seen flat. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Movie review Despicable Me - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Despicable MeThe 3-D animated feature starring Steve Carell as the villainous Gru is more exasperating than entertaining.July 09 2010|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic It isnt easy being despicable. Just ask the creators of ""Despicable Me"" who started out trying to make a movie about a villain from the villains perspective and ended up with a 3-D animated feature so saccharine that sappy sentimentality is more of a danger than exposure to evil. As that exercise in false advertising indicates watching ""Despicable Me"" can be something of a chore especially when you factor in a penchant for what the MPAA ratings board characterizes as ""rude humor."" While aspects of it are amusing (more about that later) the project also gives off the unmistakably fatal air of trying too hard. Directed by Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin and animated in a distinctly European visual style the film throws so much ersatz cleverness and overdone emotion at the audience that we end up more worn out than entertained. The villain in question would be a man named Gru. As voiced by the protean Steve Carell he starts out as a bad guy of the Boris Badenov school of wickedness given to saying things like ""you got to be pulling on my leg."" As written by Cinco Paul amp; Ken Daurio based on a story by Sergio Pablos Gru certainly does his best to be evil in the early going. He torments small children and sneaks to the head of the line to get his morning coffee. But that petty villainy turns out to be only a front for a guy who is mercilessly tormented by his ancient mother (a deft Julie Andrews) an also-ran in his chosen profession and a patsy for a trio of heart-tugging orphans. Despicable? Maybe not. We meet Gru at a crisis in his career. A new villain has just stolen one of Egypts pyramids and replaced it with an inflatable replica. In order to get back into the game and regain his place at the forefront of villainy Gru and his aide-de-camp Dr. Nefario ( Russell Brand) come up with a new objective They are going to steal the moon. ""Assemble the minions"" Gru tells the good doctor and what fun ""Despicable Me"" offers is about to begin. Everyone should have minions toiling for them and Gru has them by the dozen. Small yellow capsule-shaped and coverall wearing these minions scurry about doing all manner of work for Gru whom they adore the same way the aliens in the ""Toy Story"" trilogy worship the all-powerful Claw. Some minions have one eye others have two but all wear thick black goggles and all speak an amusing gibberish language (mostly voiced by co-director Coffin) that never masks their wacky emotions. Given the prevalence of sequels heres hoping theres a move afoot to give these folks a film of their own. Unfortunately plot elements with a lot less charm than the minions end up elbowing the little guys off the stage and theyre not a pleasure to experience. One of these is Vector ( Jason Segel) the films true bad guy. A whiny young man in an orange track suit and only marginally more effective at evil than Gru (good villains are apparently hard to find) Vector is more irritating than anything else which is not a good thing. Then there are those orphans each one more cloying than the next sensible Margo ( Miranda Cosgrove) sourpuss Edith (Dana Gaier) and sensitive Agnes (Elsie Fisher). Under the direction of slave-driving Miss Hattie ( Kristen Wiig) of Miss Hatties Home for Girls they strive to sell Girl Scout cookies by the carload and dream of being adopted and loved. Once Gru discovers that Vector has a weakness for one particular kind of cookie (the coconutties in point of fact) he determines to get the orphans under his power so he can use them in his nefarious schemes. ""My heart is a tooth with a cavity that can only be filled by children"" he tells a dubious Miss Hattie and for some reason that awful line does the trick. It doesnt take a Charles Dickens to figure out that once these nominally adorable orphans get into Grus house he will be swept away by their guileless charm and slowly turn into the father they have always wanted. Whether its what the audience has always wanted is another question entirely. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDespicable Me ride adds minion mayhem to Universal...March 19 2014Universal Pictures Despicable Me 2 denied release in...July 23 2013No. 1 Despicable Me 2 rules box office as Lone Ranger...July 7 2013Review Despicable Me 2 takes refreshing risk with...July 3 2013With Despicable Me 2 fans again go bananas over Grus...July 2 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentRussell_brandRussell BrandGruCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-despicable-me-20100709,0,7981657.story",200,despicableme16,despicableme,latimes
Despicable Me review Kids flick tons of fun | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDespicable Me review Kids flick tons of funIf entertaining animated Despicable Me wasnt arriving so soon after Toy Story 3 it wouldnt have any real box office competition.Steve Carell as Gru tells his minions about their new mission to steal the moon in Despicable Me.  (UNIVERSAL PICTURES)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarThu. July 8 2010Despicable Me(out of 4)Featuring the voices of Steve Carell Jason Segel and Russell Brand. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud. 88 minutes. At major theatres. PG If a super-villain is only as good as his minions then the evil genius in Despicable Me has it all over his competition.Stubble-headed squeaky-voiced yellow creatures that are all identically attired in safety goggles and blue overalls these minions come in one- or two-eyed varieties. Either way they add some very memorable moments of comic invention to what may be the summers wittiest kids flick.Article Continued BelowIndeed if Despicable Me wasnt arriving so soon after Toy Story 3 -- Pixars latest triumph in the eyes of critics and tykes alike -- it wouldnt have any real competition of its own this season.What with its surface similarities to The Incredibles and Monsters Inc. its easy to see the influence that the much-revered masters of the feature-length toon had on this production. But Despicable Mes core of sweetness and anarchic sense of humour makes it much more than a poor mans Pixar.Along with a small army of French animators Despicable Mes creative team includes the writing team who scripted Horton Hears a Who. Second-billed next to Jim Carrey in that film Steve Carell shines here in spite of the fact hes saddled with an accent thats one-part Boris from The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show to two-parts Arnold Schwarzenegger.He voices the part of Gru a would-be super-villain who inspires great loyalty among his hundreds of wee minions but has yet to accomplish any feat more nefarious than stealing the JumboTron from Times Square. Grus big dream is to steal the moon a scheme that requires the use of a shrink gun. He nabs it from a top-secret lab only for it to be immediately taken away from him by Vector (Jason Segel) a nerdy new rival.To retrieve it and continue his plan for extreme lunar modification he needs the help of Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) three orphans scheduled to deliver a shipment of cookies to Vectors lair. But wouldnt you know it? In the process of playing Pa to the girls who hes adopted under false pretences Gru realizes that hes got some genuine paternal feelings.While this is usually the point at which a childrens movie slides into sticky sentimentality Despicable Me gets sharper and smarter instead. Rarely do directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud let their films high spirits sag.Some very amusing original set pieces -- like an expedition to a department store by a trio of minions and a giddy amusement-park outing for Gru and the girls -- fit well next to swift spoofs of Mission Impossible and The Godfather. Likewise the buoyant musical score by Heitor Pereira is given an extra kick by several sunny new songs by Pharrell Williams of the Neptunes and NERD. And thanks to its snazzy vibrant design and some terrific visual gags (especially during the hilarious closing credits) Despicable Me will not exacerbate the 3-D fatigue already felt by moviegoers who wonder why they have to put on clunky glasses every time they enter a multiplex.Despicable Me may not match the stratospherically high standards set by Up and WALL-E but that hardly matters when its this much fun.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDespicable Me   out of four Voices Steve Carell Jason Segel Russell Brand Kristen Wiig Julie AndrewsDirectors Pierre Coffin and Chris RenaudDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG for rude humor and mild actionRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Theres nothing to despise and plenty to celebrate about Despicable Me. A whip-smart family movie that makes inventive use of the summers ubiquitous 3-D technology is something worth cheering. Though not as moving as Toy Story 3 this irreverent comedy-adventure demonstrates that Pixar doesnt have a stranglehold on clever and heartfelt animated features. The hateful titular character is Gru (short for gruesome?) a career supervillain who doesnt quite have the onerous goods to live up to his evil persona. Hes more like a big brat who didnt get enough love as a kid. Steve Carells delivery as the voice of Gru is hilarious as the bald and bumbling bad guy who yearns to be the antihero for the ages. Perhaps because of the influence of French directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin Grus character feels offbeat and original even a tad cosmopolitan. His snarky sense of humor is heightened by his strange vaguely Eastern European accent. Gru meets his match in a trio of plucky orphans. His nefarious plan includes adopting the sisters from Miss Hatties Home for Girls (Miss Hattie voiced with matron ferocity by Kristen Wiig) to assist in his heinous goal of stealing the moon. The girls are as adorable as Gru is odious. His kid-unfriendly digs prompt a series of comical misadventures. The nasty fella whos actually a softie inside is a well-worn trope that has been worked heavily in contemporary animated sagas like Shrek. But its a classic notion for a reason and given the right story it can be a winning scenario. Watching Gru repeatedly thwarted in his efforts to be unremittingly lowdown makes for clownish fun. Because hes such a failure at villainy and because hes constantly berated by his mother (a very funny Julie Andrews playing against type) we cant help but root for the guy. Flashbacks to his childhood and his mothers incessant belittling humanize Gru and keep the audience laughing. Like most people Gru just wants to make his mom proud. His plan to get a ""shrink ray"" and steal the moon seems just the ticket to solidify the disreputable status he craves. He also needs to foil the heinous efforts of the nerdy Vector (Jason Segel) whose ultra-mod house is like a latter-day Jetsons lair. This is where his adopted orphans come in with a plot to distract Vector through his love of cookies. Innovative gadgets are part of the fun as are legions of bright yellow gibberish-spouting ""minions"" (one of them voiced by Jemaine Clement of Flight of the Conchords fame) who aid and abet Grus contemptible plans. And Russell Brand is a hoot as the voice of Grus bumbling scientist-sidekick Dr. Nefario. This fun-filled adventure avoids formula with a whimsical story and terrific voice casting.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In a contest of wills a villain with access to freeze rays and rocket ships is no match for a trio of adorable orphan girls. So we are reminded by ""Despicable Me"" an animated film featuring Steve Carell as the voice of Gru an arch-fiend hamstrung by moppets. The movie is funny in a prefabricated way heavy on razzle-dazzle and light on soul. Youll probably leave the theater smiling but dont expect to be emotionally engaged Pixar-style. Youll be tickled not touched. Gru is villainy incarnate He has the bald dome and leer of a Charles Addams and a proboscis Pinocchio would envy. He speaks with a Transylvanian accent and lives in a spooky Victorian. He motors around town in a land yacht that squanders more petroleum than the Deepwater Horizon. Worst of all he picks on children. Hes resentful of a hotshot young villain named Vector (voiced by Jason Segel). Vector has stolen an Egyptian pyramid which he keeps hidden in his back yard camouflaged with sky blue paint and renderings of fluffy white clouds. That makes Grus efforts look paltry his stolen world landmarks are the knockoffs from Vegas. Worse yet Vector has seized the shrink ray that is the key to Grus plot to steal the moon. Pesky kid Vectors lair is an impregnable ultramod fortress the boys only weakness a yen for coconut cookies. To gain access Gru adopts three orphaned sisters. No-nonsense Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) smart-aleck Edith (Dana Gaier) and innocent little Agnes (Elsie Fisher) are to be his pawns. Gru is comically brusque with the newcomers bored cross-eyed by their calls for bedtime stories and kisses. All it takes is the orphans influence to puncture his bluster and thaw his icebound heart. This escapes being cloying though sometimes by millimeters. The action takes the cast through high-flying adventures in tin-can rocket ships across tightropes and on roller coasters which is where the film has the most fun. Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin make clever use of 3-D effects with stomach-dropping moments of vertigo and playful jokes about visual perspective. The supporting cast is eye-catching too. Gru is served by hordes of yellow lozenge-shaped Oompa Loompas -- sorry ""minions"" -- who supply diverting moments of head-bopping slapstick and gibberish dialogue when the main story needs a breather. The little thingamabobs (voiced by the directors) are cute though they feel contrived to drive toy sales. Russell Brand plays Dr. Nefario Grus doddering old munitions maker who supplies a fart gun when a dart gun is required. DESPICABLE ME  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for rude humor and mild action. There are a few crumbs for the adults in the audience (jabs against Wall Street when Gru applies for a loan at the Bank of Evil; Chinese tanks blasting a dove out of the sky when it violates the airspace over the Great Wall). But most of the film is high-fructose kiddie treacle. ""Despicable Me"" operates timidly within the bounds of family entertainment dealing in truisms and routine plot points rather than lampooning them. The film from Universal Studios a newcomer in the animation market is so studiously conventional it feels hollow. Once again the dramatic peak is a breakneck race to the kids recital. I enjoyed myself well enough moment to moment but Id rather revisit the funnier Grimm-er altogether superior ""Toy Story 3"" any day.

He is an arch archvillain with mommy issues and a Slavic accent commanding an army of minions yellow cylinders with goggle eyes. The minions assist him in nefarious headline-grabbing schemes like stealing the Times Square Jumbotron. (Oh the horror) When he learns that a younger archvillain has made off with the Great Pyramid of Giza Gru aims for the moon He will steal it. Take that JuniorGru (voice of Steve Carell) is the title character in Despicable Me a derivative 3-D animation affable if utterly inconsequential.Who dares to challenge Gru as the ""greatest villain of all time""? Vector a nerd in a leisure suit (voice of Jason Segel) whose father runs the Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers). Vector has invented a ray gun that shrinks its targets. If Gru can storm Vectors ultramodern bunker he can steal the gun shrink the moon to the size of a soccer ball disrupt the tides and reclaim the title Earl of Evil.Animated by the French outfit Mac Guff Ligne - which deploys a handful of coming-at-ya 3-D effects - Despicable Me is a cluttered overplotted inventory of dastardly deeds intended to show how being bad shrinks Grus heart.What makes it swell is a trio of orphans he adopts to help him steal the ray gun. (Vector lets the little girls enter because he likes the cookies they sell.) When Gru is with Margot Edith and Agnes he is different. Hard as he tries to be a Dr. Evil type he cant help but be daddy dear. The movie is about how fatherhood has charms to rehabilitate the unreconstructed baddie. In other words Gru the spiky guy who sleeps in a spiky bed learns how to appreciate soft n fluffy. (Says Agnes with a sigh cuddling a plush toy ""Its so fluffy"" an expression destined to become the seasons catchphrase.)Considerably more interesting than the arsenal of guns that freeze targets shrink objects or use squid as ammunition is the backstory explaining how Gru grew up. Nothing he invented as a child - rocket fission device or useful invention - could earn him a smile from his disapproving mother. As Mom Julie Andrews expressive grunts of eh feh and meh constitute the films most eloquent dialogue.Short sweet-and-sour and amusing rather than funny Despicable Me cant help but be likable.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-542 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Okay American movie industry we get it already. Traditionally overlooked types at the bottom of societys ladder exist mostly to provide new perspective and crucial life lessons to those at the top. And theres no heart so hardened or soul so blackened that it cant be redeemed by plucky orphans irascible elders wise immigrants the mentally disabled hick-shithole occupants etc. The CGI kids movie Despicable Me is the latest in a long line of films to follow the formula. But it features the most extreme case to date of a shriveled soul whos far more interesting and enjoyable before hes ""saved."" The first animated film from Illumination Entertainment--an indie founded by former 20th Century Fox Animation president Christopher Meledandri-- Despicable Me takes its visual design storytelling and thematic cues from Pixar. The characters smooth but tremendously expressive faces and the attention to visual detail--right down to the endangered-species-derived furniture in the house of evil-genius protagonist Gru--is sheer Pixar. So is the focus on family dynamics within the loopy immersive story in which Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) an ambitious but so-far unprofitable supervillain faces off against equally ambitious younger rival Vector (Jason Segel) but gets derailed along the way by three sweet orphans who remind him of how his own childhood dreams went unappreciated by brusque mom Julie Andrews. Until the ""creep + orphans = happy family"" formula starts demanding abrupt unconvincing character mutations Despicable Me is a giddy joy. It takes place in a world seemingly inspired by The Incredibles--the superheroes are missing but the cartoon physics crazy devices and outsized conquer-the-world plots are all in place ready to set up big action setpieces with a sly sense of humor. And the screenplay (by Horton Hears A Who co-writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul) takes time to make Gru an unusually nuanced villain one who treats his vast army of gibberish-talking minion-creatures with companionable familiarity and transforms at need from mild bumbler into honest-to-goodness bad-ass. Some of the apparent homages are a little too familiar like the evil bank exec modeled after Dilberts pointy-haired boss or the youngest orphan who seems to be Monsters Inc.s Boo plus a year or so. But mostly Despicable Me is a joyously creative refreshing piece of work right up until it falls into a hackneyed hole.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Despicable Me is an oddity but an entertaining one. Its villainous cartoon hero Gru has a broad bulbous body atop two pipe-cleaner legs. His head suggests an egg with a storks beak poking through from the inside. He speaks in a ripe accent thats roughly triangulated by Russia Germany and the Borscht Belt; if the ads didnt say it was Steve Carell doing the talking youd never know.The decision to hang a 3-D animated family film on this character is one of the mysteries of the season. Perhaps the filmmakers thought that if audiences like stinky green ogres so much theyd go for an amusing fusion of Boris Badenov and Dr. Evil. Luckily ""Despicable Me has enough visual novelty and high spirits to keep the kiddies diverted and just enough wit to placate the parents.Gru who lives in a towering Addams-style mansion in cookie-cutter suburbia wants to be the greatest supervillain the world has ever known but someone has stolen the Great Pyramid of Giza and it wasnt him. Down in his basement laboratory the evildoer summons his fusty British technical expert Dr. Nefarious (I thought it was Bill Nighys voice but it turns out to be bad boy Russell Brand in a fun character role) and his army of cute lil pill-shaped oompa-loompas to design a daring heist of the moon itself.The first catch Gru has to steal a shrink-ray from his rival a gleeful nerd supervillain named Vector (Jason Segel). The second catch The trio of adorable orphaned girl scouts Gru adopts to help get him in Vectors door (the plan involves robot cookies) threaten to thaw out his black heart and bring out his paternal side. HorrorsWhat do you think happens? Thats right of course it does. Still ""Despicable Me goes down easily. The films the first release from Illumination Entertainment an independent production company headed up by Chris Meledandri the former Fox executive behind the ""Ice Age series. He has farmed out the digital animation to the French company Mac Guff Ligne and the results are bright brisk and clever -- if the movie isnt up to Pixars level of inspiration at least its looking in that direction.The little yellow minions are funny and varied enough to sustain a movie on their own (or at least a short subject) and while theres not a lot of humor aimed at adults whats there is rich The financial institution Gru approaches to fund his evil-doing is named the ""Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers). At its most elegantly manic -- the scenes dealing with the rivalry between Gru and Vector -- ""Despicable Me has the zip of Mad magazines ""Spy vs. Spy crossed with an old Warner Bros. cartoon. The 3-D while not really necessary to the tale is just right adding spaciousness without putting your eye out.And Carell? Bless him he gives an actual performance and thus mines the necessary sympathy for Gru. The rest of the voice cast is filled out by Miranda ""iCarly Cosgrove as the oldest of the orphans Kristen Wiig as their Miss Hannigan and Julie Andrews (again unrecognizably) as the main characters judgmental mamma. The movie hints at the emotional damage that has made Gru who he is -- apparently a supervillains worst friend is his mother -- before sweeping any bummer vibes away in bursts of colorful invention.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The topical reference is pretty funny actually and everything else about the movie is wonderful especially the visual and character design. The main character is a bilious Bond-style supervillain (Steve Carell doing Russian-inflected shtick) whos suddenly outclassed by a brash young newcomer (Jason Segel); as part of the old-timers plan to even the score he adopts three plucky orphan girls and darned if they dont awaken the better angels of his nature.

Despicable Me Fair to good Directors Pierre Coffin Chris Renaud. Cast Steve Carell Jason Segel Russell Brand. Rating Rated PG for rude humor and mild action. RELATED Spotlight Steve Carell Guys as caretakers Supervillains we love Animated movies To be sure ""Despicable Me"" from Universal Studios animation arm is not the equal of a film like ""Toy Story 3"" which is a genuinely moving experience. It doesnt try to be. Instead ""Despicable"" simply plays to its strengths a funny inventive voice performance by Steve Carell; one gag after another operating on the theory that sheer volume will wear us down; and a sweet if predictable transformation story. Gru (Carell) who resembles an elongated Uncle Fester from ""The Addams Family"" is a villain. Hed like to be a supervillain but his career so far suggests otherwise. He did manage to steal the Statue of Liberty for instance - not the real one but the replica in Las Vegas. Still Grus got big plans Hes going to steal the moon. All it takes is a shrink ray and a bank loan and . . . huh. Not so easy. The Evil Bank isnt doling out dough like it used to (adults look for the funny nod to current events as Gru passes through its halls) mostly because Grus schemes never quite pay off like he hopes. Besides Grus not a young man anymore not like Vector (Jason Segel) who managed to steal a pyramid in Egypt but whose ambitions and impetuousness sometimes get the better of him. Vector has the shrink ray and the best efforts of Gru and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) his hard-of-hearing scientist assistant (yes I laughed when Gru ordered a dart gun but Nefario was off by a couple of letters) and their ""minions"" little yellow pill-shaped creatures dont seem sufficient to steal it. But then as Gru would say ""Light bulb"" He hits upon the idea of adopting three orphan girls (Miranda Cosgrove Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher) to gain entry into Vectors compound which whatever its not Shakespeare but its something to advance the plot. Gru has little interest in the girls whom he sees as nothing more than a way to get the shrink ray. But it turns out Gru has some deep-seated mommy issues (a mommy voiced by Julie Andrews as it happens) owing to her lifelong belittling of his dreams and perhaps his heart is not as icy as it seems. So no surprises there. What helps ""Despicable Me"" immensely is Carells performance. He uses a sort of indeterminate European accent to espouse various ""I am a great criminal mind"" boasts that cannot completely mask the basic clueless good-guy persona he always employs in his roles. For Gru its perfect. Sure hes a bad guy but hes bad at being bad if that makes any sense. That doesnt quite cancel out the badness and make him an out-and-out good guy - he really does plan to steal the moon after all - but its a start. You wont be moved to tears by ""Despicable Me"" and you probably wont remember half the gags by the time youve found your car in the parking lot. But you will laugh quite a bit. Sometimes - not always but sometimes - thats enough. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

It has a pleasingly off-kilter look about it - the work of a French animation house - a strong voice cast led by Steve Carell as the bumbling bad guy Gru and a delightfully cruel sense of humor. Its actually darker and odder than most family-friendly animated fare and thats a good thing - until it goes predictably soft and gooey at the end that is. But whats mainly missing from this first animated 3-D offering from Universal is story. Theres just nothing to ""Despicable Me"" and that becomes glaringly obvious when you compare it to this summers ""Toy Story 3"" in particular and Pixar movies in general where story is paramount. Here the look of the film is what makes it stand out amid the glut of summer cartoons. The characters are cute in their weirdness down to Grus shaggy growling dog. Even the trio of spunky orphans crucial to Grus latest diabolical plan - Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) - are adorable in an unusual way. The scene-stealers though are the Minions tiny yellow pill-shaped creatures with one eye and sometimes two who carry out Grus evil deeds. At least they try. But theyre also super-cute bouncing around reveling in mischief and babbling to each other in their own gibberish. If ""Despicable Me"" had come out closer to Christmas Minions probably would have made great stocking stuffers. The movie starts out promisingly enough though. Directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud and written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (from a story by Sergio Pablos) it moves along breezily with slapstick energy and a multitude of sight gags. The heavyset Gru with his hunched carriage indeterminate Eastern European accent and environmentally unfriendly vehicle hatches a plan to steal the moon. Who cares that doing so will throw Earth out of whack? He figures this is the best way to compete with Vector (Jason Segel) a hyperactive up-and-coming villain whose retro-cool lair resembles a boutique hotel. But Vector has the shrink ray Gru needs to zap the moon down to a manageable size so he adopts the trio of plucky young orphans and sends them into the house under the guise of selling cookies as a means of gaining access. He also gets some vague help back at his own evil-doing compound from his elderly assistant Dr. Nefario whose hearing problems lead to some unfortunate mix-ups. (Russell Brand voices the character in a surprisingly understated way which isnt the best use of his comic persona.) Naturally the girls will melt Grus icy heart especially as it becomes more apparent (through a series of sweetly sad flashbacks) that his villainy is a reaction to his impossible-to-please mother (voiced with perfect dismissiveness by Julie Andrews). That much is obvious from a mile away so the final-act threats to keep them apart dont seem quite so menacing. ""Despicable Me"" throws everything its got at us though - sometimes literally. The 3-D gimmick of flinging stuff at the audience gets played up for knowing laughs here especially during the closing credits. Kids will dig it adults will smile with amusement and no one will be any different afterward than they were walking into the theater.

Now dont misunderstand He adored that movie. Its just that whenever the subject comes up the first word he uses to describe the final adventures of Woody and Buzz is ""sad."" ""Scary"" too when further pressed. But ""funny""? Not once in a months time. The thought of parting with his stuffed companions is at this age too much to bear.So then to the movie featuring fart guns shrink rays and squid shooters Despicable Me whose makers worked on an Ice Age sequel and Horton Hears a Who is a silly (and yes Pixar-sweet) antidote to Toy Story 3s thoughtful heaviness--a cavalcade of kiddie giggles titters and belly laughs with as much heft as helium. Its rather joyful and heartfelt too--a summertime air-conditioned Grinch this is the story of a sad little man named Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) who learns that buried beneath his heft and hefty Mommy issues is a heart large enough to find room for three orphaned girls. To that add countless yellow pill-shaped one- or two-eyed ""minions"" who provide comic relief enough to fuel a sure-fire spin-off show on Nickelodeon a la Madagascars penguins.The result is pleasant and diverting if ultimately forgettable and its one of the rare instances in the recent history of 3-Ds resurrection as The Savior of Cinema in which the technology doesnt dim the screen or distract the focus (or fail altogether as in the case of The Last Airbender which looks more like out-of-focus 2-D). There are even sequences when the 3-D accentuates the experience when the gimmick (and thats all it is for now) transcends the studios and exhibitors excuse to charge premium prices. Grus underground lab and workshop populated by those minions and the scooter-bound scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand tamed) doesnt just look big--its a vast smoky metallic expanse. And all the roller-coaster sequence lacks is a gust of air rushing past the audience; where oh where is our 4-D?In that way Despicable Me is very much like last years Monsters vs. Aliens a 50s sci-fi homage whose wowee-zowee 3-D elevated formula filmmaking into something approaching landmark. But unlike that effort which plays poorly on cable TV stripped of its wowee-zowee 3-D Despicable Mes storyline holds its own. Carell sounding very much like a cross between Boris Badenov and Colonel Klink makes Gru a wannabe evil genius whose villainy sadly fails to turn a profit much to the dismay of the head banker at the Bank of Evil (formerly Lehman Brothers for the grown-ups). When Gru tries to steal the Eiffel Tower he ends up with a miniature one from Vegas. Turns out hes not so despicable; hes just grumpy and at present rather unsuccessful.Meanwhile an emergent competitor named Vector--a nebbish tween in a tracksuit voiced by Jason Segel--swaps a real pyramid with a blow-up replacement and is celebrated for the dastardly achievement. The old guard is under siege and so Gru sets out to accomplish the ultimate act of thievery stealing the moon. In his path lies not only Vector and the banker who wont OK the funding but also Grus mother a hectoring shrew (voiced by Julie Andrews nice touch) who were shown in flashback has spent her whole life belittling not only her grown sons myriad accomplishments but also shattering his childhood dreams. When as a little boy in a cardboard space suit he tells her hes one day going to the moon she tells him not to bother--they stopped sending monkeys a long time ago. Shes what done turned him you know so evil.But into his life stumble three girls--Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) the oldest and most practical; Edith (Dana Gaier) the wisenheimer middle child; and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) the adorable unicorn-obsessed youngest--who Gru initially considers props in a heist. The girls sellers of cookies can get him inside Vectors lair where the shrink ray he needs to swipe the moon resides. And then theyll be sent back to their home for wayward girls; if that is they all dont fall in love first and live Happily Ever After.So yes kiddies--its funny. Silly. Slight. Though grown-ups be warned I had more fun watching the kid giggle through the screening than I did watching the movie itself. Its no Toy Story 3.

And lo another 3-D animated kid movie demonstrates that cartoon storytelling pitched to young people is the last best refuge of sprightly filmmaking this hard hot summer. Steve Carell lays on a rich Hungarian goulash of an accent to become the voice of Gru an overgrown brat who drives the towns biggest environmentally incorrect vehicle (boo) and plans to steal the moon (hiss). The little girls who worm their way into his calcified heart are a sibling threesome Gru adopts only for their usefulness in his nefarious scheme -- a baroque business plan involving a ray gun that can shrink the moon to transportable proportions. Students of celebrity voice acting may want to know that Jason Segel plays Grus nicely obnoxious young competitor and iCarlys Miranda Cosgrove is the oldest of the sisters. Students of psychology will understand that everything rotten in Grus disposition can be traced to his impossible-to-please mama a sour bat whose dismissive ehhhhs come forth from the cultured throat of Julie Andrews. This student of cultural influences is even more intrigued to know that Despicable Me (produced by the folks behind Ice Age and Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who) is an American story from a Spanish animators idea fleshed out by a French animation house; no wonder a certain Euro je ne sais quoi influences the aesthetic of this charming tale of bad intentions and happy endings. The 3-D-ness of the adventure meanwhile is handled with globally translatable understatement. It would be despicable to leave before the credits where the whole 3-D craze is summed up in a well-shaped joke.

Theres nothing like a little world domination to melt the most dastardly evildoers heart. Since villains so often steal the show in animation ""Despicable Me"" smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru. Somewhere between the Grinch and Ernst Stavro Blofeld (and featuring a hunchbacked hook-nosed look worthy of Charles Addams) the Steve Carell-voiced character feels like something Universal can franchise if only they can convince auds to see it. Global prospects look solid (but hardly stellar) for this French-made 3D toon the first in Us all-ages animation deal with Chris Meledandris Illumination Entertainment. Not unlike ""Shrek"" in the way it hinges on a high-concept character a healthy dose of irreverence and a very weird accent ""Despicable Me"" isnt afraid to be silly in introducing an antihero for the ages (which makes for great in-the-moment fun but not so much to take with you upon leaving the theater). With his clownish Russian-underworld-inflected voice Gru prides himself in being the worst though his exploits to date havent really been bad enough to earn his rightful place in history. When a rival villain makes off with the Great Pyramid of Giza Gru realizes he has to step up his game. His plan Get a Shrink Ray and steal the moon then make everyone beg for mercy (though Shrink Rays are harder to come by than you might think). Also not unlike ""Lemony Snickets A Series of Unfortunate Events"" insofar as Grus plan relies on his adopting three adorable orphans and trying to raise them in his far-from-kid-friendly home pic has plenty to appeal to both girls and boys. The sugar-and-spice set should root for poor parentless Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Elsie Fisher) who had it rough enough already at Miss Hatties Home for Girls (where Kristen Wiig plays the warden-like Miss Hattie) while the boys can geek out over all Grus gadgets as well as the army of fluorescent-yellow ""minions"" (strange one- and two-eyed creatures who assist with his nefarious work). And not unlike ""Ratatouille"" which humanized hyper-critical Anton Ego by giving auds a glimpse into his childhood Gru gets flashbacks too helping us to understand that all these crazy schemes are his way of making his mother (Julie Andrews playing against type) proud. Also lifted from the Pixar playbook is the unflappable Agnes whose ability to stand her ground in the face of adversity (say having half a dozen missiles aimed at her head) recalls ""Monsters Inc.s"" Boo. If all this overlap with other kids movies is starting to make ""Despicable Me"" sound somewhat unoriginal such doubts instantly evaporate in context. Screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul (working from an original idea by Sergio Pablos) use our familiarity with a number of toon tropes to establish a certain shorthand in the storytelling delivering a narrative thats not only witty but also efficient in the telling. When Gru finds himself upstaged by pyramid schemer Vector (Jason Segel) he enlists the three cookie-selling orphans to infiltrate his rivals lair. Produced by former Fox Animation president Meledandri the film feels quite different from the Blue Sky projects (namely ""Ice Age"") that launched his career. ""Despicable Me"" plays young but the script is genuinely clever delivering much of its humor visually (all the better to translate internationally). As such pic distinguishes itself from most of the CG-animated competition out there owing more to Mad magazine (the escalating Gru-vs.-Vector conflict brings ""Spy vs. Spy"" strips to mind) than other stereoscopic 3D toons. Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin manage to keep the pace brisk without things becoming manic packing the frame and piling on the jokes so as to reward repeat viewings. Somewhere along the way the duo realized theyd struck gold with the minions (most of whom are voiced by the directors themselves in a form of high-pitched gibberish) who easily upstage Grus other accomplice Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand). As a result the movie is crawling with the odd creatures (as are the pics posters and trailers). Clearly less expensive than Pixar or DreamWorks yet polished enough to compete in their midst (with the heavy lifting done by f/x house Mac Guff stepping into another realm with this project) ""Despicable Me"" still faces a formidable challenge in getting auds to sample yet another 3D entry from an unknown outfit. One way the filmmakers have hedged their bet is by enlisting Pharrell Williams to write the theme song and score (with Heitor Pereiras help). The bassy music powers in and pumps up the movie whenever energy flags for a second giving the whole affair a hip-hop-infused ""Mission Impossible"" feel.
