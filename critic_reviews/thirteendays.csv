Publicity photo The discovery of Soviet missiles in Cuba in 1962 prompted the United States to consider launching a nuclear attack. Publicity photo ON THE EDGE OF WAR / ""Thirteen Days"" explores adrenaline and angst of Cuban missile crisis 1 / 2 Back to Gallery THIRTEEN DAYS Drama. Starring Kevin Costner Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp. Directed by Roger Donaldson. (PG-13. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Thirteen Days"" is a good movie about a profound moment in world history. It tells the story of the Cuban missile crisis a subject that on its own gives the film an impact. For 13 days in October 1962 the United States and the Soviet Union stood on the edge of nuclear war. We already know the ending but getting there is all the fun At the foundation of ""Thirteen Days"" is a story with huge stakes high drama and built-in tension. In a way all the filmmakers had to do was not blow it though with the wrong actors taking the wrong approach to the Kennedys that might have been easy. Fortunately Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp as President John Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy respectively offer subtle suggestions not absurd parodies of their historical prototypes. The movies structure as well is designed to approach the Kennedys gingerly. It doesnt tell the story through the presidents eyes but through those of Kenny ODonnell his special assistant who is played by Kevin Costner with the worst Boston accent ever heard onscreen. Related Stories A tense Thirteen Days / Sweating out the Cuban missile crisis Those who remember the real ODonnell as a soft-spoken grandfatherly figure will be surprised by the ODonnell presented here. Costner plays him as a robust politico slamming down phones and using hardball tactics. When the crisis comes he is one of the few who can speak to the president as an equal badgering him or bucking him up as the moment requires. Greenwood is smaller than our historical image of the president and he looks a bit older but that seems appropriate. Kennedy in fact looked much older up close and also more frail according to people who knew him. Greenwoods appearance as well as his quiet sober demeanor gives us the sense of seeing the private Kennedy. His performance is the best thing in the movie. ""Thirteen Days"" is fascinating in its depiction of presidential leadership in action. For days into the crisis not one adviser offers Kennedy any course that will not result in nuclear catastrophe. The Soviets are stocking Cuba with nuclear weapons and the only solution -- according to the joint chiefs -- is to launch a bomb attack on Cuba. Yet Kennedy waits. Even when elder statesman Dean Acheson (Len Cariou in a beautifully played cameo) advises a sneak attack Kennedy trusts his own judgment. ""Thirteen Days"" gives the lie to the notion that its OK to have a knucklehead as president so long as he has intelligent advisers. The movie makes it clear that only Kennedys intelligence -- and his brave willingness to appear indecisive while he settled on a course of action -- kept the world from disaster. The military leaders do their best to invite attack hoping to push the president into war whether he wants it or not. In several instances they try to trick Kennedy. These make for tense moments. In a particularly strong scene Secretary of Defense McNamara (Dylan Baker) gets into a screaming match at the Pentagon with the head of the Navy who is trying to provoke a Soviet strike. The Kennedys are the dramatic spine of the movie but alas they are not the lead characters. Kenny ODonnell is the focus and that becomes a problem as the movie wears on. Kennedy himself seems to notice that Costner is the star -- it gets to the point where he cant make a decision without looking over at him. If Kevin nods back its OK. We get dull scenes of ODonnell at home telling the missus about the state of the crisis. We also see him weeping (Costners big on weeping). In the big scene when Bobby meets with his Soviet counterpart director Roger Donaldson actually devotes time to showing ODonnell sitting outside the meeting whistling. Culp in a fine performance gives us a Bobby Kennedy in the boyish attack- terrier mode from the days before Johns assassination gave him his mature aura of fatalism and destiny. Yet even the self-possessed Bobby every now and then needs a pep talk from Kevin -- I mean ODonnell. The sensitive Kevin scenes undercut the momentum of the last hour and extend the movies length by about 20 unnecessary minutes. This is a problem but not a fatal one. Its not even a problem with Costner as an actor but with an actors stardom -- and narcissism -- getting in the way. . This film contains strong language.

In those dark and trigger-happy days President John F. Kennedy held the reins of government as the United States came as close as you can get to all-out nuclear war. ""Thirteen Days"" takes audiences deep into the White House where the president (Bruce Greenwood) his brother Attorney General Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp) and their close adviser Kenny ODonnell (Kevin Costner) are at ground zero during one of the most challenging events of the 20th century. This film marks Costners reunion with Australian director Roger Donaldson who directed ""No Way Out"" (1987) one of Costners best movies. The two again have made cinematic magic this time. After ""Message In A Bottle"" (1999) and ""The Postman"" (1997) the Academy Award winner needs a solid hit and this is it. Donaldson has made a well-paced drama from a situation that could have been just a bunch of guys in dark suits and thin ties sitting around yelling at each other. But first came the written word. Through White House tapes memoirs CIA documents personal interviews and oral histories screenwriter David Self has taken history and turned it into a finely tuned thriller. Hes also devised an extremely clever way of telling the story through the eyes of Costners character who served as special assistant to the president. (The real ODonnell died in 1977). A new perspective So many films books and TV shows have presented this period and many other events from JFKs administration from the viewpoint of the two Kennedy brothers. This time viewers get a perspective from a third party not from the glamorous Kennedys of Camelot days. As a result the film possesses a certain legitimacy others may lack. VIDEO Movie trailer for Thirteen Days Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) CNN interviews stars from the movie Thirteen Days Play video (QuickTime Real or Windows Media) If you lived through these harrowing times ""Thirteen Days"" gives an extraordinary look into the actual events kept hidden from the general public nearly four decades ago. If the missile crisis is something you know only from history class this film attaches living breathing characters to one of the most dangerous periods in modern history. In retrospect President Kennedy made all the right moves to keep the Soviet Union and the United States from triggering a full-scale nuclear attack which would have killed millions. This film shows the intense indecision contradictory opinions blatant power grabs and behind-the-scenes intrigue that faced this president during a defining moment in his administration and the history of the world. It began on October 16 1962 when Kennedy was given photographic evidence of Soviet-installed medium-range ballistic missiles in Cuba a mere 90 miles from the U.S. mainland -- weapons that in minutes could hit numerous cities including Washington. The revelation stunned Kennedy his advisers and his cabinet and set up the chief executive for a flurry of conflicting advice. Hawkish military advisers such as Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay wanted to go to war. Others such as Adlai Stevenson the countrys ambassador to the United Nations urged the two countries to talk.

(New Line Cinema) It might take a few moments of adjustment before you can settle in to ""Thirteen Days"" the movie about President Kennedys agonizing dilemma during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis. I mean Kevin Costner -- who plays JFKs political adviser Kenneth P. ODonnell -- is talking in a Boston accent for one thing. Plus hes pacing the halls of the White House with President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp). And theyre talking funny too. But those Boston brogues -- and the initial worry that were trapped in a docudrama full of walking talking look-alikes -- soon fade away. Director Roger Donaldsons taut understated thriller pulls you into a powerfully engaging situation -- when the Kennedys their advisers and the entire world found themselves contemplating the distinct possibility of global nuclear war. For a drama thats obliged to turn on ideas memos nuances and situation-room chatter (rather than the more visceral visual fare of most Hollywood thrillers) ""Thirteen Days"" is tremendously effective. David Selfs screenplay based on historical records and documents White House tapes memoirs and interviews with some of the players feels like classic television theater at its best. And its easy to accept these performers as the very real people they portray. Its October 1962. And the Russians have outfitted Cuba with enough medium-range missiles to put the United States into a state of hysteria. President Kennedy meets with his top Cabinet advisers including national security adviser McGeorge Bundy (Frank Wood) Defense Secretary Robert McNamara (Dylan Baker) and brother Bobby to assess the big picture. What emerges in ""Thirteen Days"" isnt the menace of the Russians; its the political pressure that informs every decision. Of course the future of America is at stake. But so is the integrity of Kennedys decision-making power. This is about good sense finding the perfect niche between pacifist concession and military overreaction. The president has to consolidate his liberal-influenced principles with the views of more hawkish advisers such as Gen. Maxwell Taylor (Bill Smitrovich) Dean Acheson (Len Cariou) and Gen. Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway) who are pushing for immediate military action. ""The big red dog is digging in our back yard"" LeMay says. ""And we are justified in shooting him."" Seeking the advice of elder statesmen such as Acheson has its limitations argues ODonnell. Eventually the buck stops with President Kennedy. ""There is no wise old man"" ODonnell says. ""[Expletive] theres just us."" It should be noted that Costners role as ODonnell is greatly exaggerated; ODonnell did not have the significant role the movie implies. But the filmmakers retain the emotional truth of those terrifying days and the idea that the Cuban missile crisis was a war of public relations in which craftily worded communiques stern exchanges before the United Nations and other public signals became the weapons of choice. This was about who would blink first. Well were not all speaking Russian now. So we know the eventual outcome of the movie. But the tension remains palpable nonetheless as the fate of the world hangs on the collective good sense of a handful of men. Can the Americans collective wisdom prevail? Can they keep their red-white-and-blue bulldogs calm and persuade the Soviets to curb theirs? Like President Kennedy director Donaldson (who made ""No Way Out"" another pretty good Washington-seat-of-power thriller) has found a perfect balance of often-opposing forces between recorded history and the demands of plain old entertainment.THIRTEEN DAYS (PG-13 138 minutes) -- Contains emotional intensity some offensive language.

The films impact is rooted in the mind and spirit of John F. Kennedy who as played - wonderfully - by the Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood seems to loom up out of the past with both the stature of legend and the present-tense cut and sweat of humanity. Kennedy facing down not just the Russians but his own military advisers has to draw on every fiber of his intellect his Machiavellian cunning and his courage. Thirteen Days offers an unrelieved dose of early-60s white men standing around in rooms talking but its a gripping glorification of what real leadership is all about.

The Cuban missile crisis which in bringing the East and West to the brink of nuclear conflict represented the tensest moment of the Cold War has been turned into a solid historical thriller in ""Thirteen Days."" Reasonably intelligent well-crafted and dramatically understated by contemporary standards this capably acted look at how the Kennedy White House navigated a successful course through treacherous political seas has all the prosaic virtues of a high-end old-fashioned television production albeit with a few modest action elements thrown in. With sufficient critical support this prestige New Line Christmas release should draw well among serious-minded adult viewers especially with boomers who retain youthful memories of school nuke-attack drills and JFKs TV speech. Potential appeal to younger viewers to whom the era in question seems as remote as the Crusades is another matter but channeling history into a suspense format can only help in this regard. Most significant previous dramatic treatment of the incident came in fact on television in the acclaimed 1974 ABC Theater production ""The Missiles of October"" written by Stanley Greenberg directed by Anthony Page and starring William Devane as JFK and Martin Sheen as RFK. That production possessed more scope in the sense that it covered events in Moscow as well as in Washington D.C. (Howard da Silva played Khrushchev) while new rendition skews things to put a peripheral figure from the three-hour TV film presidential aide Kenny ODonnell into the center of the action. ODonnell a member of the Kennedy ""Irish Mafia"" who had been a Harvard classmate of Bobbys and had worked on JFKs Senate campaigns was especially trusted by the president on military matters and if not a decisionmaker per se was a valued adviser and tough-minded problem solver. While placing ODonnell in the orbit of critical events David Selfs script fortunately isnt intent upon inflating him with undue importance and positioning such a figure in the foreground puts the Kennedy brothers in relief in a way that helpfully removes some of their iconic aura. As always with this sort of project depicting a relatively recent event there will be carping and naysaying about its accuracy by those with personal memories of the event. Dramatically however Selfs decisions work pretty well and viewer confidence about the way the film depicts the speculation arguments machinations negotiations brinkmanship and compromises involved in resolving the crisis is bolstered by a basis in tape recordings of many of the discussions. In rather too-insistent fashion extensive footage of nuclear explosions is used to set the context for the standoff that began Oct. 16 1962 when U.S. spy plane photographs revealed that the USSR had smuggled medium-range ballistic missiles into Cuba and was within a couple of weeks of making operational nuclear weapons that could reach the American capital within five minutes. No background as to the whys or hows of this development are offered notably the fact that Soviet Premier Khrushchev had been so unimpressed with President Kennedy at their summit meeting that he thought he could get away with such an audacious gamble. American officials were stunned by the revelation -- as ODonnell puts it ""I feel like we caught the Jap carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor"" -- and for six days they managed to keep the news a secret while they scrambled to develop a proper response that the president for one hoped could stop short of a military strike that would likely trigger an all-out war with West Berlin as the likely first casualty. In workmanlike fashion that maintains a judicious unfrenzied focus on the personal jockeying among JFKs Cabinet members and advisers against the backdrop of monumental events director Roger Donaldson steadily lays out the dramas many twists and turns while adroitly slipping many characters into the mix. On the one side are the hawks led by Dean Acheson and two generals Maxwell Taylor and Curtis LeMay who fairly drool at this golden opportunity to blow up ""the red bastards."" On the other side are liberal doves personified by U.N. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson whose natural inclination toward diplomacy and negotiation has the stench of timid appeasement to everyone else. In between in their uncertainty about what to do are nearly all the others including JFK who at moments all but commits to a military response only to let prudence overtake him a hesitance no doubt forged on the shores of the Bay of Pigs disaster early in his presidency. Placed in charge of ExComm the exec committee of the National Security Council Bobby keeps pushing for alternatives to a military strike and finally gets one from Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara who floats the idea of a naval blockade. Its this plan that the president presents to the public when he makes his fateful TV address on Oct. 22 and while the rest is history there are many intriguing and suspenseful wrinkles along the way to Khrushchevs final capitulation and the removal of the missiles risky low-level flights over Cuba to get a better look at the installations near-disastrous encounters with Soviet ships headed for the island Stevensons surprisingly tough ""hell freezes over"" speech at the U.N. the shooting down of a U-2 spy plane uncertainty over Khrushchevs fate and the back-channel contact with a Russian spy and subsequent secret meeting between RFK and Anatoly Dobrinyn that resulted in the last-minute defusing of tensions. Its all as dramatic and powerful as real-life stories come and Donaldson and Self respect this fact by dealing the cards straight with no frills or stylistic affectations. Most of the drama consists of men in suits and uniforms arguing tactics and mulling things over in well-upholstered rooms. But the way in which they wrestle with agonizing issues largely maintain their cool and finally land on their feet proves very absorbing and the entire episode makes one grateful that on this occasion at least the U.S. government was in good hands. Given the memorable looks and distinctive vocal qualities of JFK and RFK portraying them is always a dicey enterprise but Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp respectively pull it off. Lankier and a bit more taciturn than one remembers the president Greenwood folds his arms a lot and affects other gestures with his hands and wrists. But he manages to catch an intelligence and thoughtfulness vital to a successful impersonation of the young chief executive and he gains in authority just as the character does. As the attorney general Culp appropriately assumes more aggressive body language and pours more blunt energy into his quite credible portrait. Having already starred as a Southerner in ""JFK"" Costner is back again in Kennedy country only this time in possession of a Boston accent thats less reliable than those assumed by Greenwood and Culp. All the same one stops dwelling on the vicissitudes of the regional dialect after the initial scenes and Costner ends up giving a low-key unshowy performance that blends effectively with the ensemble. No one is given the opportunity for showstopping cameos and Donaldson deserves credit for adroitly orchestrating the large and capable supporting cast keeping the identities of the participants pretty clear and smoothly bringing them in and out of the spotlight. Tech contributions are straightforward and supportive without calling attention to themselves. Thirteen DaysProductionA New Line Cinema release presented in association with Beacon Pictures.
