Among those I rushed to most impatiently is ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" (which Anthony Lane reviewed in the magazine last November). The pathos of the main characters woes and struggles is almost inescapable and I didnt try to escape it identifying with her and rooting for her was a positive if rather simple pleasure. Its also nearly impossible not to recall while seeing ""Precious"" another of the seasons popular movies ""The Blind Side."" Both deal with nearly-silent academically troubled black teen-agers from horrific families who are rescued by well-meaning outsiders. ""Precious"" is the better film for several reasons. Its director Lee Daniels attempts to get at the title characters inner life through voice-overs and fantasies whereas the director of ""The Blind Side"" John Lee Hancock treats its main character the young Michael Oher as a blank slate. Also Daniels gets closer to his actors reveals their physical features more distinctively (even getting Mariah Carey to de-glamorize) offering a more intimate sense of the world he depicts. Nonetheless the key relationship between the two films is political--and each is the political inverse of the other. In ""Precious"" the girls saviors are a teacher and a caseworker--i.e. government employees. In ""The Blind Side"" theyre private individuals and a private school. The divide in the movies target audience isnt black and white its blue and red ""Precious"" is aimed at those who think of the government as a likely source of good works ""The Blind Side"" at those who dont. The full title of ""Precious"" should be ""Precious Your Tax Dollars at Work."" I say this without sarcasm I think that schools and social work are what tax dollars should be going for because I think that the rescue depicted in ""Precious"" can more readily be replicated as needed than that of ""The Blind Side."" But I think that theres one aspect to the process that Daniels elides the force of law. A key scene in ""The Blind Side"" involves Sandra Bullocks character going into the projects and threatening with a gun local toughs who hassle Michael. In ""Precious"" teachers and caseworkers prevail with verbal authority but what Daniels doesnt show is that their authority is backed up with arms which they themselves dont wield. I could imagine a confrontation at the caseworkers office with a menacing client who wont take no for an answer and who is arrested by police officers on the premises simply as a way of establishing that Precious herself isnt merely being helped but is also being protected--and (spoiler alert) the threat of a protection order proves implicitly to be a key aspect of the story. The legitimized violence of law enforcement is far harsher and less idealistic--or so to speak less overtly liberal--than education and social work but its inseparable from them. Parenthetically I dont think of ""Precious"" as a distinctively African-American story; its tale of an abused girl who ultimately fights back could as readily involve a white family.

Comments (1) The Blind Side Recommended Video Rated PG-13  126 minutes  2009 Based on the nonfiction book by Michael Lewis this potent tearjerker tells the story of Michael Oher a gigantic black teenager from impoverished West Memphis who accepted as a charity case by a local Christian academy and taken in by a wealthy white family became an All America offensive tackle and was drafted in the first round by the Baltimore Ravens. The story is inspiring and involves sports but to call it an inspirational sports story would be wrong; its real center is Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock in a fine performance) the strong-willed woman whose love and generosity helped turn a mute hopeless boy with no social or academic skills into a functioning young man with a promising future. Some will call the movie racially paternalistic and they may well be right but as a fable about the power of giving it hits pretty hard. John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) directed his own script; with Tim McGraw Kathy Bates and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. By J.R.

In the right hands this could be about simple kindness overcoming mutual suspicion and bridging social divides - a story questioning an America where it takes such charity to effect genuine social mobility. This is certainly not that movie. Instead it resembles one of those formatted TV reality shows where the top-billed female personality uses her bossy common sense to tame recalcitrant kiddies/ animals so their parents/owners can be proud of them. Quite how Sandra Bullock deserved an Oscar for her one-note turn as bleached supermum Leigh-Anne is a mystery since it transforms a potentially worthwhile character study into a grandstanding star vehicle. Her comic timing is just-so and she invests the homespun one-liners with a veneer of sincerity but theres no way this is a real person. Its Sandra Bullock doing her thing.On the other hand Michael (Quinton Aaron) the troubled outcast to whom she gives a stable home -the rest of her family know better than to argue with Leigh-Anne - is hard to read beyond gentle giant cultural cliches. Meanwhile director John Hancock shows us enough of the lads scary hope-free ghetto background to tell us we dont want to go there. He lends the proceedings a patina of class and a certain entertainment value yet the whole approach (in marked contrast to say Precious) is about putting white middle-class compassion proudly centre-stage.

Sandra Bullock was impressive and very watchable on screen. It is true that films that portray real-life events are more like ly to lead to an oscar for the star in question but I do believe that Sandra Bullocks performance justified her award. The film was fairly emotional and I think if most blokes went to see a film which they expected to be primarily about american football they would be disappointed.

Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) reads to son S.J. (Jae Head) and Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) in The Blind Side which is based on a true story. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Blind Side   1/2 out of four Stars Sandra Bullock Quinton Aaron Tim McGraw Kathy BatesDirector John Lee HancockDistributorWarner Bros.Rating PG-13 for one scene involving brief violence and drug and sexual referencesRunning time 2 hours 8 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Blind Side while inspiring is a little myopic. The true story of wealthy white Southerners who take in a homeless black teenager and encourage him to play football is a natural for the screen. Its even more powerful when we learn that he now plays in the NFL for the Baltimore Ravens. MORE Interview with Tim McGraw But this sports drama about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) never strays from the surface parading a series of kind acts by Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw) but never delving into the ramifications of their actions or exploring more complicated socioeconomic and racial issues. Ohers early life with a crack-addict mom and absentee dad must have been hard but director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) glosses over it in favor of a more conventional movie for easier mass consumption. TRAILER Watch a clip Leigh Anne Tuohy a Memphis society matron and mother of two spots Michael near her childrens school on a cold winter night clad in only a T-shirt and shorts. When she learns hes a classmate of daughter Collins (Lily Collins) and appears not to have a home she invites him to bunk in their mansion for the night. Hes appreciative but uncommunicative. But Leigh Anne and her brood are a big-hearted lot taking in Michael indefinitely eventually regarding him as family. Aarons performance is understated and appealing. But this is Bullocks movie and it is perhaps her best role. She drops her trademark girl-next-door persona to play a Southern belle. Backing up her spirited personality with a blondish lacquered coif and impeccable designer clothes Bullock bears a resemblance to Kathie Lee Gifford. Perhaps the real Tuohy is as gutsy and irrepressible as Bullocks version of her but the movie lays it on thick. While generous and determined Leigh Anne also is a rabid football fan who boldly marches up to high school players picking her high-heeled way across the muddy field to dispense her cultured pearls of coaching wisdom. Shes so feisty she takes on a crack dealer and his pals. When the dealer insults her she pops off ""Im a member of the NRA and Im always packing."" Hard to imagine the guys not falling over laughing at this former cheerleaders channeling of Charlton Heston. The Blind Side- based on Michael Lewis book The Blind Side Evolution of a Game- has strong performances and stirring football scenes. But its superficiality keeps it from being the moving story it could have been. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

The real Oher was a heavily recruited high school prospect a lineman who currently plays for the NFLs Baltimore Ravens.The movie is a kind of My Fair Tackle with a discomfiting racial overlay. Blacks live in weed-strewn projects ruled by crack dealers. Apparently their best hope is to latch onto a white benefactor styled by Ralph Lauren.Bullock is terrific as this fables Professor Higgins. Her Leigh Anne is a mix of Southern decorum and sass a woman who hides her big heart under a bossy no-nonsense shell.Like most of the characters in The Blind Side she undergoes instantaneous and convenient conversions.Over lunch she suddenly discovers that her best gal pals - together they look like The Real Housewives of Memphis - are narrow-minded bigots. No hint of this ever emerged in the thousands of Cobb salads she shared with them over the years?A quick and implausible on-field pep talk from Leigh Anne (a speech prominently featured in trailers and ads for the film) transforms Michael from a clumsy and passive player into an unstoppable pile-driver.McGraw nearly unrecognizable with a clean shave and an Alfalfa part in his hair is appealing when given an opening but hes mostly there to hold Bullocks purse.The scene-stealer is supposed to be their freckly young son S.J. (Jae Head) but hes too impish and precious by half. Watching the kid put Big Mike through a rigorous training regimen assemble a recruiting-highlights disc and negotiate with high-powered college coaches (Nick Saban Lou Holtz Phillip Fulmer Tommy Tuberville and others play themselves) is reminiscent of Timothy Mouse leading around Dumbo.Kathy Bates makes a late appearance as a miracle tutor. She has the best accent in the cast. Then again she is a Memphis native.However obvious The Blind Side is touching - despite its habit of dropping major character notes into the melody without warning. For instance Leigh Anne suddenly starts spouting pieties in her final voice-over.Praise the Lord and roll the credits.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + It may be based on a true story but ""The Blind Side delivers two heart-yanking hours of Hollywood physics. One kids bad existence gets better with the application of a great deal of upper-middle-class pressure. The movie recounts the story of how a tough-loving interior decorator named Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra Bullock ) invited Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) an enormous athletic African-American teenager into her Memphis McMansion to live with her two children and adoring husband (Tim McGraw).Leigh Anne is the unstoppable force. Michael is the immovable object. But as his grades improve and as hes nudged toward a Division 1 football scholarship (hes a natural tackle) Michael starts to open up. But were meant to believe that its Leigh Anne who does all the growing. Which seems about right for a movie built around Bullock. She is as entertaining as she gets here.In miniskirts and clingy pants and with a heavy cosmetic lacquer Bullock sashays away from the camera leaving the males in a tizzy. The last word is always hers. Shes part Erin Brockovich part Julia Sugarbaker. And like Sugarbaker Leigh Anne is a designing woman. Her interest in Michael feels momentarily like an extension of her job. ""Lord knows that place could use some color she says of the private Christian academy that has charitably accepted Michael who until Leigh Anne was homeless and could barely express himself. The state wrested him away from his birth mother whos a drug addict.Bullocks levelheaded acting frequently saves the movie from emotional garishness. Shes hardly subtle but shes not showy either. This is basically one of her comedic parts given a ""Real Housewives gloss. But watching Bullock light up with satisfaction brought back unwelcome memories of that nauseating hug she gives her Mexican maid at the end of ""Crash I love you person of color. Leigh Anne gives Michael his very first bed and a real shot at a college football scholarship. He reminds her that her dining room table happens to be useful for dining with the family someplace other than in front of the two TVs in the living room.Writer and director John Lee Hancock bears down on the more affecting parts of Michael Lewiss 2006 book ""The Blind Side Evolution of a Game. (Half of it was devoted to Oher the other to Lawrence Taylors arrival in the NFL.) The Touhys compassion and the idea of a white community banding together to help a disenfranchised black teenager is a touching human display (Kathy Bates even shows up as a tutor).Hancock doesnt exactly have a heavy touch. Following the arc of Lewiss journalism he delicately raises possibilities of cynicism boosterism and liberal guilt and the movie grazes the idea of being afraid of certain black male stereotypes - long after they occur to us but still. And it seems to anticipate our worry that Michael gracious and pacific as he is and as good as Aaron is in the part has too few thoughts of his own. Oher plays in the NFL for the Baltimore Ravens now and you wonder how he feels about being represented as such a passive part of his own success.Commercial American movies seem interested in stories about young black men saved from God knows what by nice white people or sports. Here its both. That double jackpot happens occasionally in life. But its a staple in Hollywood where large kind black men are sometimes both a blessing and a threat (see ""The Green Mile). Ohers life is meant to make us feel good and it mostly does. But how good we feel about his story is proportional to how blind were willing to be about how its told.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

A strong performance from her is undercut by a script mired in stereotypes. (Ralph Nelson) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday November 19 2009 520 PM Title The Blind Side Biopic about football player Michael Oher. With Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw Quinton Aaron. Director John Lee Hancock (205). PG-13 Brief violence references to drugs alcohol and sex. At area theaters. As her memorable turn in ""Crash"" suggested Sandra Bullock is most interesting when she can break free from the binds of rom-com chains.And its easy to see why she was drawn to ""The Blind Side"" which is based on Michael Lewis nonfiction best seller about football player Michael Oher. Unfortunately though writer-director John Lee Hancock has turned Ohers remarkable life into a Hollywood fable that trades difficult truths for easy cliches.As Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy Bullock and Tim McGraw try to overcome Hancocks simplistic script and to some extent they succeed. Bullocks Leigh Anne is a Memphis matriarch with two kids a sprawling McMansion and a successful design firm. But when she meets Michael (Quinton Aaron) he becomes her priority.The abandoned son of a crack addict living in the projects Michael has been admitted to the private Christian school her children (Jae Head Lily Collins) attend. The coach expects him to save their football team the teachers doubt hell ever pass and the entitled students arent exactly welcoming. Meanwhile all Michael wants is a place to sleep at night. Enter Leigh Anne who sees a lost soul that could use saving. She and her family provide the love and support Michael needs before he can even start thinking about playing for the Tuohys beloved alma mater Ole Miss. As his biography and televised interviews indicate Oher is a smart guy with an unbreakable survival streak. As Hancock sees him however hes one of Hollywoods favorite stereotypes the ""gentle giant"" indebted to the kindness of his patrons. Though its his story his character mostly stays silent and reflects the qualities of the wealthy white family that adopts him.Bullock and McGraw however work hard to cut through this self-congratulatory view of complex racial and class issues. While both are excellent its fair to say that Bullocks appealing portrait of a strong-willed Tennessee belle ranks among the best work of her career. Its just too bad the movie around her comes up short. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Blind Side reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Blind Side reviewed. The Blind Side reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 20 2009 1125 AM Illegal Use of Sandra Bullock The Blind Side should have been a great movie about football. By Josh Levin The Blind Side Michael Lewis book The Blind Side tells the true story of Michael Oher a poor black kid who gets adopted by a rich white family and transforms himself into a football star. The movie version zooms in on Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) the woman who gave the hard-up prodigy the care and feeding that he needed to become a man and an NFL draft pick. This feels less like an artistic choice than an economic one. The Blind Side plays like filmmaking by focus group a movie that aims to please and ends up condescending to its audience. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. By definition an inspirational sports movie tells a story thats almost too good to be true. Michael Ohers escape from homelessness and illiteracy certainly hits that mark. ""Big Mike"" (played by Quinton Aaron) shuffles around Memphis Tenn. with his head down looking sad and saying not much at all. Once he moves in with the Tuohys the humongous cipher slowly opens up--he prefers to go by ""Michael"" he confesses--thanks to the love of the first real family hes ever known. At the same time the 345-pound behemoth taps into a heretofore unknown ability to smash and bludgeon on the football field leaving college recruiters frothing at the mouth over his potential as a left tackle. The problem with a story thats almost too good to be true is that someone in Hollywood will try to make it better. Writer-director John Lee Hancock a veteran of the swelling-music-at-the-big-game genre--he helmed Disneys The Rookie (2002) the feel-good account of an old guy who becomes a major-league pitcher--compensates for the nonverbal behemoth clogging the center of his story by embroidering the edges. Ohers adopted sibling Sean Jr. (Jae Head) becomes a Lipnicki-esque scamp who--when hes not making an adorably sassy remark--puts his big bro through the paces on the football field. Ohers high-school coach Hugh Freeze who in Lewis book comes off as a gridiron savant is depicted as a whistle-blowing boob a foil for Leigh Anne Tuohys more emotionally attuned pedagogy ""This team is your family Michael."" Advertisement A movie based on real events should be allowed some creative license. Its no high crime for example that the filmmakers skip over the fact that Oher became eligible to play college ball by padding his GPA with correspondence-course credits. The cheap grabs for emotional resonance in The Blind Sides screenplay gall far more than the films elision of minor details. In real life Oher pushed a trash-talking defensive lineman so far off the field of play that he was penalized for ""excessive blocking."" In the movie the bile-spewing opponent comes with a racist heckling dad the better to give Bullocks Leigh Anne an opportunity for righteous indignation. Theres talk of Bullock finagling an Oscar nomination for her role here and for good reason--The Blind Side appears to have been engineered with precisely that goal in mind. The rom-com queen does indeed stand out as a willful compassionate mother hen but she doesnt come across as a real woman. Leigh Anne is a movie mom and The Blind Side is essentially a series of set pieces--a parking lot showdown with lowlife hoods a how-dare-you-judge-me confrontation with her upper-crust ladyfriends--designed to let Bullock earn her top billing. For all The Blind Sides flaws its impossible not to get caught up in Michael Ohers life. (And if youre a sports fan theres also some perverse pleasure to be had in watching the nations leading college football coaches--Nick Saban Lou Holtz Phil Fulmer and more--labor to play themselves. If youve never heard former Ole Miss coach Ed Orgeron speak you owe it to yourself to hear the unintelligible Cajun say ""I hear that kid can really pepper the gumbo."") Youre rooting for Oher to make something of himself for him to succeed on the field and for him to find happiness with his new family. But most of all youre rooting--praying hoping--for his story to be told in a movie that wasnt made for Sandra Bullock.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 19 2009 248PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Blind Side Written and directed by John Lee Hancock Starring Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw Quinton Aaron Jae Head Lily Collins Kim Dickens Ray McKinnon and Kathy Bates Classification PG Weve been through lots of shameless melodrama with Sandra Bullock Everyone remembers that crowded bus with a ticking bomb ( Speed ); then there was the handsome imaginary boyfriend in a coma ( WhileYou Were Sleeping ); not to mention the beauty pageant booby-trapped with terrorists ( Miss Congeniality ). Thats okay though. Movies have been about shameless melodrama since D.W. Griffith packed Lillian Gish off on an ice floe in Way Down East (1920). And you can say this about Bullock Through all her sweaty travails the actress has displayed sure comic timing and infectious gumption. As Huck Finn said of girls he liked ""Shes got sand in her."" This time out however Sandy has gone too far. Though her latest The Blind Side  is based on a true story its also a preposterous fairy tale - a football story that deserves a penalty flag every other play for piling on the sentiment. Big Mike Oher (Quinton Aaron) is a refrigerator-sized orphan who is adopted by a virtuous Steel Magnolia. That would be Bullocks character Leigh Anne Tuohy who first sees Michael wandering lost in the rain and out of the goodness of her heart gives the African-American teenager the spare bedroom of her familys Memphis mansion. Before long hes being tutored by Miss Sue (Kathy Bates). Leigh Anne being from the South and therefore a football fanatic also takes an interest in the boys eventual professional career showing him how to pass block. Soon college recruiters and fame beckon. ""Youre changing that boys life"" a friend tells Leigh Anne. ""No hes changing mine"" she says her eyes going moist. A corny line for sure. Also too true. At times Mike seems absent in what is supposed to be his story. This is not a movie about a poor black kid making good so much as one about a rich white woman feeling good about helping someone less fortunate. ""Is this some kind of white guilt thing?"" one of Leigh Annes pals remarks at a catty ladies luncheon. No its something more vexing self-congratulatory Hollywood liberalism - the kind of high-minded hokum that has marred movie meditations on race relations since Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy so graciously invited Sidney Poitiers parents over to dinner way back in 1967. Even the films big crisis of conscience - does Leigh Anne take in Michael to persuade him to attend her own football-factory alma mater Ole Miss? - only incidentally involves her adopted son. The Blind Side doesnt even guess at who Big Mike might be. The teenager has no interest in girls. Doesnt drink or hang around friends - bad or good. Hes a 300-pound black smiley face who likes playing football. The film is built to please and is often entertaining. Especially the middle sequence in which 110-pound Leigh Anne plays pulling guard for Big Mike flattening anyone who stands in the way of her boy getting all the attention and help she feels he deserves. Watching Bullock push family members college administrators and violent drug dealers around like so much stick furniture were reminded what a skilled comedienne the actress can be. Any American network interested in resuscitating the now-virtually-extinct domestic sitcom should give her agent a call. Still the knock against Bullocks movies remains the same All too often the only good part in her films is her own. In The Blind Side  husband Sean Tuohys (Tim McGraw) only real function is to peel out his fat wallet at restaurants and shake his handsome head signalling ""shes quite a gal"" after Leigh Anne goes on yet another rampage. What an unpleasant surprise then that Bullocks new film gives over so much screen time to a freckle-faced little child actor who could and should at any point here be arrested for mugging. Jae Head as little S.J. Tuohy is a full-throttle scene-stealer. Any sensible director would have made him put them back. Then again The Blind Side probably indulges Head because the film is afraid to allow Big Mike to be alone with teenaged sister Collins Tuohy (Lily Collins). What a drag that one year into Obamas presidency American films remain so careful about depicting black actors. There are more around to be sure. The new action film 2012 has three black leads (Chiwetel Ejiofor Danny Glover and Thandie Newton). And of course Quinton Aaron shows up here as Big Mike. Still not one of them is at all interesting. Its almost as if directors hurry past the black actors scenes afraid of making a mistake.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""The Blind Side"" Leigh Anne Tuohy sits with some girlfriends at a classy Memphis restaurant. The ladies who lunch are talking about the young man Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) and husband Sean (Tim McGraw) have taken into their home.Doesnt she worry the gaggle asks about her teen daughter? Its an unpleasant moment meant to underscore how racial anxieties persist how they sully attempts to reach out. And Bullock with her hair dyed blond fashions a sharp but understated retort making it clear that Leigh Anne is one of those steely magnolias. The young mans name is Michael Oher (pronounced ""oar""). Hes huge. Hes 16. Hes got a marked learning deficit. Hes emotionally locked-down. Hes African-American. If those descriptions sound at all familiar it may be because ""The Blind Side"" based on the true story of the Tuohys and gridiron star Michael Oher opens the same day as the highly touted ""Precious"" about an obese pregnant illiterate and yes abused Harlem teen named Claireece ""Precious"" Jones. Timing is a beautiful thing and not to be shrugged off especially if youre a filmgoer who finds cultural riches in odd con- vergences. The simultaneous arrivals of Big Mike as hes called by some and bigger ""Precious"" in a similar yet told-so-differently story speak volumes about how studio films differ from risk-taking indies. It might also teach us a thing or two about how differently composed audiences see things. Though there are plenty of folk making Precious transformation possible the child is the hero of her tale. In ""The Blind Side"" Bullock not Oher is the one transformed. The movie is based on Michael Lewis terrific book ""The Blind Side Evolution of a Game."" The film is more interested in the evolution of a family than football but it still begins as the book does with Leigh Anne recounting the story of how Lawrence Taylor snapped Joe Theismanns leg and ended the Redskin quarterbacks career one November day in 1985. Taylor made it necessary for NFL teams to hire a new kind player agile and hefty at the left tackle position to protect the right-handed quarterbacks blind side. What the NFL requires college programs seek to deliver. Michael Oher looks to have the right stuff. The Wingate Christian School coach thinks so and bullies and cajoles the private-school administration into accepting a kid who doesnt belong academically. But it is the Tuohys who provide the homeless classmate of their kids a life thats a few miles and a lifetime away from a Memphis housing complex called Hurt Village. Leigh Anne drives a creamy BMW wears a bling crucifix and Chanel sunglasses. Sean Tuohy has made a pretty penny with a slew of fast-food franchises. Their house looks like one of those modern McMansions though McDonalds isnt one of Tuohys chains. But the movie is about what makes a home not a house. And one cold evening thats just what Leigh Anne offers the teen who attends the Wingate Christian School with her children. Portrayed by newcomer Quinton Aaron Michael is a gentle giant with soft eyes a slow grin and a ferocious will to protect. Leigh Anne likens him to Ferdinand the Bull the character in the childrens book she read her kids. Everything the Tuohy children Collins (Lily Collins) and Sean Jr. or ""S.J."" (Jae Head) have is foreign to Michael. His mother was a drug addict. The father he didnt know died violently. ""The Blind Side"" is in many ways the right sort of ""feel-good film."" Its got heart and resonant lessons. Kathy Bates is amusing as Miss Sue the tutor hired to help Michael reach a 2.5 grade point average in order to be eligible for college ball. The football nuance of the book is abbreviated. Even so gridiron fans may delight in the cameos of coaches as themselves Lou Holtz Nick Saban Houston Nutt among them. Still there are some problems fed most likely by studio execs fretting that American audiences need lots of sugar with their bitter truths. Too much sweetener comes by way of Head as the youngest Tuohy. Hancock encourages the kid to be way too cute. (Theyve ruined the beauty of the fist bump.) That said its easy to imagine that Heads goofily open energy will offer other kids like S.J. a way into this family film. We never learn why Leigh Anne is so fearless but Bullock is the force here. McGraw is an amiable anchor to her bull-by-the-horns portrayal. Were left to guess at the mystery that led her to invite a kid with little but the clothes on his back into her home her family her heart.

Movie Information The Blind SideRatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector John Lee HancockActorsSandra Bullock Tim McGraw Kathy Bates and Quinton AaronRun time 129 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (one scene involving brief violence drug and sexual references)SynopsisSandra Bullock and Tim McGraw take in a homeless teen in this film based on a true story.More movies from GuideLive.comAnd the question is Why?Her peculiar career choices make writer-director John Lee Hancocks fine and powerful new film The Blind Side even more welcome than it might be otherwise. For the overwhelming reaction upon seeing this Oscar-worthy performance is ""finally"" followed quickly by ""Why the heck did it take so long?""Bullock plays well-to-do Memphis housewife Leigh Anne Tuohy. Tuohy defies social convention her well-manicured but not so well-meaning ladies lunch group and numerous other obstacles by offering food and a place to sleep to a homeless hulking African-American kid with no education and a crack-addicted mom.As Longview native Hancock says this amazing true story is all about nature versus nurture and because of Tuohy nurture wins in a big way. Bullock brings the best of her abilities to a role that calls for the same physical humor she mastered so endearingly in the 1995 romantic comedy While You Were Sleeping.But playing Leigh Anne Tuohy demands so much more from an actress and Hancock who played a huge role in casting The Blind Side saw Bullock as perfect for the part. He says he based his decision on having seen her in Crash which partly because of her won Best Picture.In its title The Blind Side alludes to the unprotected area that allows a quarterback to be sacked when he least expects it often with disastrous consequences. The film opens with actual footage of former Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann suffering a career-ending injury when linebacker Lawrence Taylor floors him from the blind side with a crippling tackle.Taylors ferocious hit prompted the National Football League to put far more emphasis on the position of left offensive tackle whose primary job is to protect a right-handed quarterbacks blind side. Its no coincidence of course that the young man Leigh Anne Tuohy championed is now the Baltimore Ravens superstar left tackle.Michael Oher came from nowhere to be a highly coveted offensive lineman and not just because his adoptive mom (far more than his coach) taught him the value of protecting those he loves. She protects his blind side and does so in a way that teaches us about caring and compassion and how as a society with an ever-widening gulf of haves and have-nots the haves have a dire responsibility to do so much more than they are. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Sandra Bullock plays a steel-willed Memphis belle in ""The Blind Side"" based on a true story about a well-heeled family that took in a near-homeless barely schooled African-American boy Michael Oher (newcomer Quinton Aaron) and set him on the road to success as a football star. (He now plays for the Baltimore Ravens.)It would all seem a bit patronizing if it wasnt true. The filmmakers pay lip service to the storys racial undertones without ever really rocking the leaky boat.Bullock is fun to watch though.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Nov. 20 2009Starring Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw Kathy Bates and Quinton Aaron. Directed by John Lee Hancock. 128 minutes. At major theatres. PG As southern as pecan pie and twice as gooey The Blind Side presents a simple view of the true story of homeless African-American teen Michael Oher who ends up living the gridiron dream with the support of a white Memphis family.Based on Michael Lewiss book The Blind Side Evolution of a Game the story is a heartbreaking look at how a hulking kid with an 80 IQ fell through the cracks missing out on schooling and societys care.It may be the story of Oher - 6-foot-10 Quinton Aaron is adequate in his first starring role despite being ridiculously cast as a 17-year-old at age 25. But The Blind Side is really all about Sandra Bullock who takes on the role of designer-dressed lady who lunches Leigh Anne Tuohy with a ferocity that hasnt been seen since Scarlett OHara vowed to never go hungry again.Article Continued BelowTuohy and her family take Michael in and with the help of a feisty tutor (Kathy Bates) help him earn the grades to net a scholarship.But the movie glosses over the deeper issues of the tale ones dealing with race poverty privilege and ethics opting for the feel-good quick hit that makes the overall experience unsatisfying.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Part football movie and part ""Precious"" with a happy ending John Lee Hancocks ""The Blind Side"" is a heart-tugger that once again proves that sometimes truth (more or less) is stranger than reality. Although still sporting the same blond wig Sandra Bullock redeems herself after the dreadful ""All About Steve"" by beautifully playing Leigh Anne Tuohy a Steel Magnolia in Memphis who takes a troubled black teenager named Michael Oher into her very white familys McMansion. ""Who ever thought"" Leigh Annes husband Sean (country singer Tim McGraw very good) remarks later on the couples prejudices ""we would have a black son before we knew a Democrat?"" There arent that many one-liners in ""The Blind Side"" which is basically a true rarity a fish-out-of-water drama about race relations centering on Michael who like the heroine of ""Precious"" is large African-American abused and functionally illiterate -- but no dummy. Michael is on the verge of flunking out of a lily-white Christian academy when Leigh Anne -- seeing him running around in shorts and a T-shirt during the dead of winter -- decides to make him an improbable member of her family. The Tuohys young son (Jae Head) is on board with the idea although his older sister (Lily Collins) resists at first. The reaction from Leigh Annes friends is more pointed. ""Is this a white guilt thing?"" one pal asks her. In fact the well-to-do Tuohys who describe themselves as rednecks are no liberals -- but they take Christian principles seriously. They do meet that Democrat a liberal tutor (Kathy Bates most effective work in years) hired to help Michael improve his grades enough that he can try out for the schools football team. You can guess the rest even if you didnt know that in real life Michael Oher became a star for the University of Mississippi (the Tuohys alma mater) and was drafted by the NFLs Baltimore Ravens this year. What makes ""The Blind Side"" a Thanksgiving treat is director Hancocks subtle touch and admirable refusal to yield to sports movie cliches something he did previously with ""The Rookie"" and ""Remember the Titans."" Quinton Aaron portrays Michael (who has very few lines of dialogue) with enormous expressiveness. And Adriane Lenox conveys a lifetime of pain in her two brief but exquisitely handled scenes as Michaels crack-addicted mother.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Blind Side Drama. Starring Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw and Quinton Aaron. Directed by John Lee Hancock. (PG-13. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Blind Side"" tells a nice human story about a family that takes in a homeless teenager and helps him realize his dreams - ""realize"" in both senses of the word. At the start of the movie this young fellow is so pressed by the demands of daily existence that he has no ambition except to stay warm and survive. But once he has a home he starts looking at the world and discovering what he can do and how far he can go. This is the real-life story of Michael Oher who in 2009 was a first-round NFL draft pick. Its a good story. If someone were telling you this story you might say ""Wow. Thats something."" Even so the narrative is not quite big enough to bear the weight and significance that writer-director John Lee Hancock tries to attach to it. ""The Blind Side"" runs 126 minutes - there are versions of ""Hamlet"" that are shorter - and lingers over every nuance of this young mans journey. And though the movie engenders a fair amount of sincere emotion at times the hearts and flowers feel pushed. Seven years ago Hancock made a terrific movie called ""The Rookie"" another real-life tale about the redemptive power of sports but what Hancock had going for him in that film was a grown-up protagonist who knew he had to succeed that his life depended on it. In ""The Blind Side"" Hancock has at the films center an unformed teenager who doesnt want much or know much and who is thus in no position to drive a story forward. That responsibility falls to Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy a well-off Southern woman a full-steam-ahead type with lots of guts highly developed protective instincts and complete self-confidence. When she meets Michael and realizes his circumstances she impulsively invites him into her home and gradually this African American teenager becomes a member of this white Republican Mississippi family. Bullock is most of the fun here. As a Southerner herself she gives the impression of knowing Leigh Anne inside out - her sense of justice her resourcefulness and her willful lack of sentiment which is a cover for a vulnerable inner life. Bullock brings wit and incisive observation to the role a familiar combination for this actress whose charm sometimes causes people to overlook her skill. Tim McGraw offers warm support as her husband a fast-food magnate who somehow isnt 250 pounds. ""The Blind Side"" is never dull but its rarely more than gently entertaining. As Michael Quinton Aaron lumbers through his performance with a look of sensitivity and bewilderment which is right for the character but problematic in terms of the movies energy. In directing the film Hancock takes his time which is a good thing but then after a while he starts taking your time and thats not so good. Still this filmmaker is too talented to ever drop the ball. College football aficionados may find more to enjoy here - inside jokes riffs on the rivalries between various teams and cameo appearances by famous coaches including Nick Saban Tommy Tuberville Houston Nutt Tom Lemming and Lou Holtz. -- Advisory Some drug use and a brief scene of violence.

"Review The Blind Side - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Review The Blind SideSandra Bullock and newcomer Quinton Aaron have a warm and winning chemistry in director John Lee Hancocks fact-based story of a football-loving white familys adoption of a homeless black teen.November 20 2009|By Betsy Sharkey film critic gt;gt;gt; FAMILY TIME Leigh Anne (Sandra Bullock) her son SJ (Jae Head) and her adopted... (Ralph Nelson / Warner Bros. )Watching ""The Blind Side"" is like watching your favorite football team; youll cheer when things go well curse when they dont and be reminded that in football as in life its how you play the game that counts -- though winning doesnt hurt either. Im talking to the jocks here. The rest of you can just bring Kleenex and give in to this quintessentially old-style story that is high on hope low on cynicism and long on heart. If Frank Capra was still around director John Lee Hancock might have had to fight him for the job. Based on the remarkable true story of Baltimore Ravens tackle Michael Oher -- once a homeless black Memphis teenager literally plucked off the road on an icy winter night by a well-heeled white family -- the movie stars Sandra Bullock as Leigh Anne Tuohy. Shes a spitfire of a mom and its the kind of smart sassy role Hollywood should have given the actress ages ago. Michaels story begins in a Memphis project aptly named Hurt Village with a drug-addicted mother an absentee father and a childhood in and out of foster homes all of which we get compressed into a few quick flashbacks scattered through the film. Its what became of Michael (newcomer Quinton Aaron) that the film is concerned with and that is framed by something else entirely the Tuohy family and Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismanns career-ending injury in 1985 after a blindside tackle by New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor. The film opens as does the Michael Lewis book on which it is based with a breakdown of the four seconds from the snap of the ball to the snap of Theismanns leg that would change the game with Bullock narrating the still difficult to see footage from that night. (Theismann has said even he cant watch it.) Michael it turns out will have the weight size and speed to block the Lawrence Taylors of the world an increasingly valuable commodity in the football world. And thats where the Tuohys come in -- as a football-obsessed family they nurture his raw talent; as fundamental Christians they keep an eye on his soul. Leigh Anne is a force of nature in a Chanel suit armed with a cellphone and a .22. In the role Bullock blows in like a tornado issuing orders in a rapid-fire Southern drawl that defies speed and ruffles more than a few feathers. Its not her fault she just knows shes right and wont stop until everyone else is on the same page. And believe me Bullock makes ""join rather than fight"" the option you want to take. She nails the character with every click click click of her heels and every toss of those perfectly coiffed blond locks. When she stares down a drug dealer while she assures him her Saturday Night Special works just fine on all the other days of the week you feel like ducking too. The rest of the clan is made up of husband Sean played with an easygoing charm by country singer Tim McGraw teenage daughter Collins (Lily Collins) and young son SJ with Jae Head pulling off such a perfect mix of Leigh Annes cockiness and Seans charisma that you miss him when hes not around. Michael ends up enrolled in the private Christian school where the Tuohy kids go. His size and agility had caught the coachs eye and hes accepted despite having a grade-point average that barely registers. That fateful freezing night when Leigh Anne takes him home comes soon after and almost overnight he is being absorbed into the family which has not only an open heart and an open mind but a serious obsession with football Ole Miss in particular. What happens next is a testament to the unique people that both Leigh Anne and Michael are. As she begins to piece together the depressing back story of his life he begins to trust that she will be there for him. These are emotional colors not easy to get to but they happen here in moving ways because of the chemistry between Bullock and Aaron. She infuses the role with empathy not pity; he brings an aching vulnerability and an innocence that are remarkable for someone with no formal training. You know going in that this is a success story but it still is deeply satisfying to see Michaels life unfold.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune November 19 2009 -- 631pm Courtesy Of Warner Bros. Picture Courtesy Warner Bros. Entertainm SANDRA BULLOCK as Leigh Anne Tuohy Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Uplifting. Heartwarming. Schmaltzy but effective. Watching ""The Blind Side"" I felt my emotions being stage-managed but once or twice I got something in my eye. Its inspired by a feel-good true story of interracial adoption and gridiron glory. The project could have been designed by scientists synthesizing the crowd-pleasing-movie genome. Bullock + football + Kumbaya = Ka-ching Sandra Bullock plays Leigh Anne Tuohy a steel magnolia whose conservative certitude and indomitable willpower make Sarah Palin look lily-livered. The highway department has bulldozers that are not as pushy. Her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) owns scores of fast food franchises her daughter and son go to Memphis swankiest Christian prep school and she has a decorating business and country club luncheons to fill her idle hours. Perhaps her take-charge ego needs a new challenge. For whatever reason when she sees a black teen walking along a dark roadway she orders him into her car and takes him home for a sleepover. When she learns that the boy Michael Oher has nowhere to live she gives him a permanent home in her McMansion. The Tuohys are the sort of family that would fight a tax hike for idealistic social programs but see their Christian duty to do right by Michael. Films dont show us compassionate conservatives like this very often and I was happy to meet them. Michael doesnt see his situation in racial terms. (""He thinks hes a redneck"" Sean marvels.) Neither do the Tuohys but they learn a few unpleasant truths about their friends attitudes. Michaels quiet appreciation of their advantages teaches his privileged new family gratitude. When one of her lunch cronies praises Leigh Anne for changing the boys life she insists ""Hes changing mine."" Newcomer Quinton Aaron plays Michael as a gentle giant with a broken spirit so inhibited hes almost mute. He has native intelligence but a fractured school system has left him unprepared. Leigh Anne brings on a tutor and when his grades allow him to play on his schools team he promises to be an unstoppable football star. All he lacks is the killer instinct. Leigh Anne is the woman to teach him about standing his ground and pushing back hard. The film balances the hugs and life lessons needed in a womens picture with plenty of tackles and touchdowns to please the men. NFL fans know how the story ends and theres no need to spoil it for everyone else. THE BLIND SIDE  OUT OF FOUR STARS RATING PG-13 FOR BRIEF VIOLENCE DRUG AND SEXUAL REFERENCES. Bullock makes her iron-willed matriarch strong sexy and likable while McGraw fades into the wallpaper as her yes-man spouse. Young Jae Head is sassy enough for twins as son S.J. who bosses his big (big) brother around; hes clearly mommas little man. And here we get into some queasy issues the one aspect of the film that feels unsatisfactory. The Tuohys never patronize or condescend but they seem clueless about several acts of racial insensitivity. Leigh Anne comments that easygoing Michael reminds her of Ferdinand the Bull an endearing comment that carries an unfortunate subtext here. I hope the idea is that the good-hearted Tuohys are novices around black people. Nearsighted though it occasionally may be ""The Blind Side"" makes a strong case for the emotional rewards and social justice of helping others less fortunate. Even if it manipulates us like a sock puppet.

Where Your Mother Lives If He Gets His Grades Up Does Michael Get The Family Discount? Two weeks after Precious opened to blockbuster grosses along comes The Blind Side another life-struggle chronicle centering on an uncommunicative smart but stunted 300-pound African-American teenager who overcomes enormous familial and social problems with the help of outsiders. Like Precious The Blind Side features a domineering matriarch (played by an actress whos being touted as an Oscar contender) a well-known singer giving a persuasive performance in a supporting role a concerned teacher going beyond the call of duty and a couple of supportive comic-relief buddies. Unlike the tale told in Precious however The Blind Sides story is contrived storybook sweet credulity-straining and ... um true. Its based not on a novel but on Michael Lewis fact-based football book The Blind Side Evolution of a Game roughly half of which is devoted to the rise of Michael Oher from impoverished circumstances in Memphis Tenn. to college stardom at the University of Mississippi. (An end-credit sequence brings the story up to date Oher was a first-round 2009 NFL draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens where he currently plays right tackle.) Near the start of the film when feisty Memphis belle Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) sees 16-year-old Big Mike (Quinton Aaron) wandering aimlessly in the rain after a function at the private Christian school her kids attend she intuits that somethings amiss. Her kids confirm that Big Mike attends the school but hes essentially homeless and when it becomes clear that hes got nowhere to spend the night she invites him to bed down on a couch in her familys palatial manse. The next morning he gets up before the rest of the household folds the sheets neatly and heads down the tree-lined driveway. But Leigh Anne whos something of a good-cause force of nature is not about to let him go back to wandering the streets. Instead with the none-too-veiled racism of her affluent friends ringing in her ears shes soon buying him clothes installing him in his own bedroom and hiring a tutor to get his grades to a level where he can play football a sport at which she and everyone else assumes -- given Big Mikes enormous size -- hell be a natural. Not so much as it happens. But that just means that pint-sized 10-year-old Tuohy son S.J. (Jae Head) can set himself up as amateur coach and get the familys newly recruited gentle giant into shape as Mom works to make him more aggressive. While Aaron comes across pleasantly enough as a reluctant jock his Big Mike is almost incidental to a story thats framed less around him than around the family that adopts him (literally) and pushes him to succeed. The Blind Side is chiefly tailored as a vehicle for Bullock whose hard-charging Leigh Anne is shown off admired and allowed to walk off with almost every scene. At once irrepressibly sunny and pushy enough to seem a royal pain -- and so fiercely implacable in defense of her young ward that you entirely understand why everyone from drug dealers to football coaches to country-club matrons would back down in her presence -- shes the reason the story remains as engaging as it does on-screen. Lest she seem too much of a pill shes met everywhere by smiles smiles and more smiles. Country-music star Tim McGraw is fine as Leigh Annes affably acquiescent hubby as is Ray McKinnon as an affably flustered football coach. Kathy Bates affably liberal good-ol-girl tutor has her moments especially one in which she admits to being a closet Democrat. And Adriane Lenox makes a quick impression as Big Mikes neglectful but loving mom one of the few characters depicted as not having much reason to be relentlessly upbeat. John Lee Hancocks julep-sweet screenplay pretty much turns the books measured account of Ohers story into a feel-good fantasy for white liberals. The film doesnt spend much time delving into big-picture questions and its content to trade in stereotypes when the camera wanders to the less affluent side of the Tennessee tracks. But as ever in Hollywood the based-on-a-true-story defense will probably provide a certain amount of cover. Hancocks only aiming for a crowd pleaser and by not challenging the established playbook for inspirational sports dramas hes no doubt got one.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sports movies have a long troubled history of well-meaning white paternalism with poor black athletes finding success through white charity. But The Blind Side based on Michael Lewis non-fiction book finds a new low. In the character of ""Big Mike"" (real life success story Michael Oher played by Quinton Aaron) a poor undereducated teenager later groomed into a top-tier offensive lineman the film suggests a gentle oversized puppy in need of adoption. (The family that takes him in literally picks him up from the streets during a rainstorm like a stray. All thats missing are the children pleading ""Mom can we keep him?"") Given his background and 0.6 GPA theres no question that Oher was well behind his peers but casting him as a big-hearted simpleton makes him seem subhuman more mascot than man. Lewis book heads down two narrative tracks. One concerns the increased importance of the left tackle position in football to protect the ""blind side"" of right-handed quarterbacks; the other follows Oher a former all-American Ole Miss left tackle and current Baltimore Ravens rookie who was rescued from terrible poverty and put through a private Christian high school in Tennessee. Save for a prologue that forces viewers to relive the gruesome Joe Theismann injury from multiple angles the film understandably discards the former thread in favor of the personal story. Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw star as the Tuohys a wealthy couple who offer Oher a nice home a tutor (Kathy Bates) to raise his grades and a controversial pipeline to their alma mater should his success on the field match his immense potential. The Blind Side paints Bullocks Leigh Anne Tuohy as a tough-as-nails Southern belle who acts as Ohers left tackle in life shielding him from the racist whisperings of the country-club set and a dim high-school coach who doesnt know how to communicate with him. (Aarons Oher looks lost on the field until she asks him to imagine the quarterback and running back as family members to protect from harm. As if anyones that dim.) Theres real ambiguity in the Oher case but writer-director John Lee Hancock papers over it; its possible to see the Tuohys as generous caring people without brushing off their less-altruistic reasons for sponsoring Oher. But true to a movie with a regrettably old-fashioned view of race relations its all much simpler than common sense dictates.

"Blind Side The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blind-side-the ) Blind Side The (United States 2009) November 18 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The marketing campaign for The Blind Side plays up the inspirational aspects of the story - that its based on the real-life rags-to-riches tale of football player Michael Oher and the woman whose fierce love and determination to help him allowed him to see the Promised Land. Theres no doubt this is a crowd-pleaser as occasional bursts of applause attested during the screening I attended. The film skillfully plays on an audiences emotions but thats what this sort of movie does and director John Lee Hancock shows a sure hand when it comes to careful manipulation. He rarely goes too far and he knows enough to leaven the heavy emotional aspects with bursts of comedy and the occasional telling point about what causes us to value individuals in this society. Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) was selected in the first round of the 2009 NFL draft by the Baltimore Ravens. This is a sanitized (some might argue ""Hollywood-ized"") version of events that brought him to that point. When the film begins hes a lost teenager who has been accepted to a private religious school because of his untapped potential as a football player. The coach (Ray McKinnon) salivates when he considers Michaels size and strength on his offensive line - hes a bear of a man - but Michaels academic performance is so poor that he is ineligible to play. He has no home - the State took him away from his crack-addicted mother when he was a child and he mostly looks for warm places to spend the night. He is wandering the streets in the cold and the rain when Leigh Anne Touhy (Sandra Bullock) spots him. She and her husband Sean (Tim McGraw) recognize him since their son S.J. (Jae Head) and daughter Collins (Lily Collins) go to his school. Impulsively Leigh Anne invites Michael to spend the night on her couch and that one night becomes the first of many. Michael becomes a part of the Touhy family his performance at school improves and he is finally able to show what he can do on a football field. To be sure there are some stock elements in the story such as a scene in which Michael returns to the projects and confronts some of the gangsters who knew him as a child. But whats impressive about The Blind Side is how many of the familiar clichA(c)s are not to be found in the movie. No villain is invented to generate unnecessary conflict. There is no weepy reunion between Michael and his birth mother. There are no tortured scenes of drawn-out family bonding. The Blind Side isnt exactly subtle but neither is it cloying. Hancock who also directed another inspirational sports drama The Rookie gets the tone just about right. And while things are softened considerably for the PG-13 rating there are hints of darker elements that dont quite make it to the screen. In a way this is Precious for a family-friendly audience. Lee Daniels movie is more gritty and gripping but the core message is the same about an individual with profound disadvantages overcoming his or her disabilities and finding success in life. Both are fairy tales of a sort and it hardly matters that one has its roots in fact and the other is based on a work of fiction. Some will doubtlessly dismiss The Blind Side as another example of a heroic white person saving a black victim but although there is an element of truth in that perfunctory description it misses the point. This is more about simple human decency and economic disadvantage than it is about racial inequality (although it would be disingenuous to ignore a link). Leigh Anne helps Michael not because of the color of his skin or his potential as an athlete - she does it because she sees another human being suffering and reaches out to him. Others like Coach Cotton have ulterior motives for extending themselves. Although the central character in the real life drama is Michael thats not necessarily the case with the movie in which the script strikes a balance between Michael and Leigh Anne. But where relative newcomer Quinton Aaron operates a little under the radar Sandra Bullock is anything but low-key. She is very good in this juicy role - the right mix of tough love and occasional vulnerability. Theres some of the Julia Roberts vibe from Erin Brockovich here and it would be foolish to assume the actress was unaware of the Oscar potential inherent in the part when she accepted it. Still Bullock pulls it off and it seems possible a nomination could be in her future. She is ably supported Tim McGraw is likeable as the supportive husband whos along for the ride; Lily Collins shows spunk as the little sister who defies peer pressure to embrace her new brother; and Jae Head provides most of the comedic relief. Aaron meanwhile has the physique to play Michael and his acting is solid enough for him to be able to pull off the role of the gentle giant but he spends a fair amount of time in Bullocks shadow. A number of college coaches have cameos; Nick Saban is probably given too much screen time. Hes a truly awful actor as becomes evident as soon as he begins reciting dialogue. The trailer makes The Blind Side out to be more mawkish than it is. Although there is some softening of the edges and amplification of the positives the film doesnt take it to extremes or play the audience for fools. The script is generally pretty smart - it begins with a fabulous voiceover detailing how Joe Theismanns 1985 injury resulted in Michael having a shot at eventual stardom - and the characters are nicely developed. Its easy for an inspirational movie to try too hard to get viewers to cheer. This one achieves the goal by allowing the good feelings to emerge organically rather than by artificial means. In a head-to-head comparison one would be hard-pressed not to declare that Precious is the better film - it makes fewer compromises and doesnt shy from showing the true ugliness only hinted at in this movie but The Blind Side is more accessible. Its easier to digest. In the end both films tell stories of triumph over adversity - a category of drama that uplifts while offering a dollop of social commentary.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr TAKE IT TO HEARTH Jae Head Quinton Aaron and Sandra Bullock have a family gathering in The Blind Side (Ralph Nelson) C The Blind Side Genre Sports Drama; Starring Quinton Aaron Sandra Bullock Tim McGraw Kathy Bates; Director John Lee Hancock; Author John Lee Hancock; Release Date Wide 11/20/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 125; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted November 19 2009 -- 1200 AM EST Every so often American pop culture coughs up a family thats too good to be true -- and of course its that very too-goodness that makes them irresistible to audiences (or is supposed to at any rate). In the 70s we had the wholesome double whammy of the Waltons and the Bradys and in the 90s the compulsively charitable clan of 7th Heaven. More recently the Duggars on 18 Kids and Counting have nudged that squeaky-clean homespun virtue into the reality TV era. According to The Blind Side you can now add another family to the list the Tuohys. That would be blond tart-tongued and down-home saintly Leigh Anne played by Sandra Bullock trying a middle-American-mom role on for size (and finding the fit comfortably snug); her husband Sean played by country superstar Tim McGraw as a benign domestic yes-man who is never more happy than when hes kowtowing to his wife; and their picture-perfect neo-50s kids beautiful teen achiever Collins (Lily Collins) and toothy scamp SJ (Jae Head). A glowing prosperous bunch who live in one of the tonier sections of Memphis (Leigh Anne wears a six-studded diamond crucifix that looks like it must be worth 100000) the Tuohys are all about sweetness and light along with a spoonful of sass to help the sugar go down. The day before Thanksgiving theyre driving along in their oversize car when they spot one of Collins classmates at the Christian Wingate School. His name is Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) and hes 17 doughy and tall and appears every inch the lost lonely and homeless young fellow he is. Leigh Anne as impulsive as she is good doesnt waste a moment before asking him over to the Tuohy home where they put him up for the night. He stays for Thanksgiving when they all clasp hands to say grace and before long hes been invited to live with the Tuohys and become part of their family. He trades in his worn gray clothes for a series of colorful striped rugby shirts which is how we know that his mood is brightening. Michael known as Big Mike is a refugee from the projects and hes been wedged into the Wingate School by a football coach who sees his potential as a Mack truck of a lineman. But he can barely read and doesnt have much inclination to talk. Aaron who plays him has an appealing gentle-giant presence. Since Michael rarely says more than a few words at a time you keep scanning his kind sad eyes and hesitant manner for a hint of what hes about and also to see how exactly hes going to mesh with this family thats embraced him as an act of charity adventure and brotherly love. As The Blind Side presents it however there isnt a lot to Michael. He shows no interest in girls or friends or videogames or TV shows. Even compared with the superficially similar lost girl in Precious he never asserts himself or asks for anything. He just hangs out like a fifth family member whos also a kind of mascot. The three kids get along great -- at one point Mike and SJ do a duet on ""Bust a Move"" which is about as exciting as things get -- and theres never a hint of tension or of finely woven camaraderie among them. Written and directed by John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) The Blind Side is a feel-good movie that never stops feeling good. The film is based on a true story (it was adapted from a nonfiction best-seller by Michael Lewis) but you never feel that Hancock has honestly captured whats true about it. Hes so devoted to showing us what upbeat selfless folks Leigh Anne and her family are that the movie never quite gets around to discovering what any of those far superior saintly-family TV shows surely would have a dramatic conflict. Not that there arent you know plot points. Will Michael manage to get his grades up? Will he make it on the football team? And how will he handle those college recruiters? In theory its fascinating to see Bullock harness her considerable appeal to the role of a ? Republican Christian housewife whos a card-carrying member of the NRA. Yet what The Blind Side offers is a kind of liberal Hollywood version of conservative values all rock-solid valor all the time. The result isnt solid at all -- its more like cotton-candy uplift.

"Movie review The Blind Side a football drama starring Sandra Bullock washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Blind Side Movie review The Blind Side a football drama starring Sandra Bullock Quinton Aaron left and Sandra Bullock connect as a football player and the woman who helps change his life in the uplifting drama ""The Blind Side."" (Ralph Nelson) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 20 2009 Theres been something off-putting about the ad campaign for ""The Blind Side"" a drama about a white woman who adopts an African American high school student from trailers trafficking in nearly every troubling African American stereotype in movies (from the Magical Negro to the surly low-level bureaucrat) to posters featuring the patronizing image of Sandra Bullock gently leading her looming gentle giant of a son down a football field. It turns out that ""The Blind Side"" is much better than its ads largely because its based on the true story of Michael Oher and Leigh Anne Tuohy. Grounded in the direct disarming truth of their experience the movie has a straightforward lack of cheap sentiment that saves it from being either too maudlin or saccharine-sweet. Bullock making a comic-dramatic play for ""Erin Brockovich"" territory is perfectly suited to play the tart no-nonsense Leigh Anne who when she sees Oher (Quinton Aaron) walking alone on a cold rainy Memphis night spontaneously invites him to stay with her family. What ensues is the kind of entertaining uplift Hollywood does best its dramatic elements leavened by frequent moments of comedy (mostly at the hands of Leigh Annes precocious youngest son played by Jae Head) and stirring sports sequences. If viewers may experience a twinge of misgiving about the issues of race and class that are elided in ""The Blind Side"" they cant help but be enormously entertained and moved by its irresistible story. Especially in the films soaring triumphant final moments viewers get the sense that this isnt a story about race or redemption or the complexities of class and culture. Its a story about the authentic compassionate response to vulnerability and need. Its a story about family.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains one scene involving brief violence and drug and sexual references. 126 minutes.

Its whether I win or lose.Ralph Nelson A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Another poor massive uneducated African-American teenager lumbers onto screens this month two weeks after Precious and obviously timed as a pre-Thanksgiving-dinner lesson in the Golden Rule. But unlike the howling rage of Claireece Precious Jones The Blind Sides Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher (Quinton Aaron) is mute docile and ever-grateful to the white folks who took him in. Directed by John Lee Hancock and based on a true story recounted in Michael Lewiss 2006 book of the same name Blind Side the movie peddles the most insidious kind of racism one in which whiteys are virtuous saviors coming to the rescue of African-Americans who become superfluous in narratives that are supposed to be about them.The steel Magnolia who takes pity on homeless Big Mike after she sees him walking in the freezing rain in just a polo shirt and XXX-large denim shorts is Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) a frosted interior decorator wife of Taco Bell franchise owner Sean (Tim McGraw) and mother of teenage cheerleader Collins (Lily Collins) and hyper half-pint S.J. (Jae Head giving the years most excruciatingly muggy performance by a child actor) who attend the same Christian academy that recently accepted the mountainous youth. An officious caretaker Leigh Anne clears out the guest bedroom for Michael earning the nervous praise of the Tennessee doyennes with whom she regularly lunches. Though they congratulate their friends altruism theyre convinced Leigh Annes new charge will either rob her Memphis McMansion or violate her daughter ""Youre changing that boys life"" one applauds. Her response of course ""No. Hes changing mine.""In a way Ohers story does change Bullocks life giving her an awards-bait role filled with preachiness and thickly accented speech--""seriousness"" after this years rom-com humiliations The Proposal and All About Steve. But for all the supposed uplift Bullocks facile Good Christian Materialist Southern Woman is part of The Blind Sides desperate cynicism succinctly expressed in Seans comment to his wife ""Michaels gift is his ability to forget.""Viewers however are constantly reminded of the pathologies the black gentle giant has escaped the crack-addicted mother (""I cant even remember who the boys father is"" she weeps to Leigh Anne) the thugs of the country-ghetto housing project who offer him a 40-ouncer. Life with benevolent white people gives Michael the golden opportunity to partake in one of the most patronizing we-are-the-world scenes imaginable dueting with S.J. on ""Bust a Move."" S.J. becomes an unbearable martinet bossing Michael around during drills for football practice where the large lad shines as a left tackle at the Christian academy eventually drafted to Ole Miss (and as real-life footage of the actual Oher shows during the closing credits later to the Baltimore Ravens). But Michael is unable to figure out what he actually needs to do on the field--until his white momma explains it to him ""This team is your family. You protect them.""In every scene Oher is instructed lectured comforted or petted like a big puppy; he is merely a cipher (Aaron has at most two pages of dialogue) the vehicle through which the kind-hearted but imperfect whites surrounding him are made saintlier. ""Am I a good person?"" Leigh Anne asks Sean non-rhetorically--as if every second in this film werent devoted to canonizing her.Michael is aggressively courted by SEC football coaches (many playing themselves an unintentionally grotesque parade of bad orthodonture and worse-fitting suits) and after an unpleasant run-in with an NCAA official toward the films end Leigh Anne soothes Michael by assuring him that ""the past is gone the worlds a good place and its all gonna be OK."" The filmmakers would like to lull you to sleep with this milk of amnesia hiding behind the fact that this bewilderingly condescending movie is based on an actual person--but one who you end up knowing almost nothing about.

After swinging for the fences and scoring a sleeper success with ""The Rookie"" (2002) writer-director John Lee Hancock takes the field with ""The Blind Side"" another uplifting and entertaining feel-good fact-based sports drama. The combo of top-billed Sandra Bullocks marquee allure and a true-life story with well-nigh irresistible emotional appeal probably would be enough to fill megaplex stadiums at any time of the year. But this Nov. 20 Warners release is particularly well positioned to be a four-quadrant hit as the consensus choice of family auds during the upcoming Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Based on material in ""Moneyball"" author Michael Lewis ""The Blind Side Evolution of a Game"" the attractively packaged pic occasionally runs the risk of straining credibility -- or worse inviting skepticism -- while dramatizing the particulars of what was evidently a best-case scenario for all parties involved. Indeed theres not even the threat of an insurmountable obstacle until the final half-hour. But then again its difficult to imagine anything that could long impede or contain the force of nature that is Leigh Anne Tuohy the feisty Memphis belle played by Bullock with equal measures of acerbic sass steel-willed brass and unabashed sentiment. Bullock is thoroughly convincing in the role -- right down to her credible accent and the blonding of her normally brown tresses -- and shes not afraid to occasionally keep auds guessing as to whether Leigh Anns actions are driven by a heart of gold or a whim of iron. Both motives appear to be at work when Leigh Ann impulsively invites into her familys palatial home one of her daughters classmates Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) an immense African-American teenager from the poor side of town. Virtually homeless and barely educated after years of neglect Michael can scarcely speak much less read. But he shows promise as a football player and thats more than enough for a desperate coach (Ray McKinnon) to finagle a way for Michael attend his tony Memphis private school. After that its up to Leigh Ann and her family -- lovingly tolerant husband Sean (Tim McGraw) lovely teen daughter Collins (Lily Collins) and wiseacre young son SJ (Jae Head) -- to make sure Michael takes advantage of his good fortune and actually learns a few things from his teachers. If ""The Blind Side"" werent based on a true story -- the real Oher ultimately was adopted by the Tuohys thrived in his new environment and currently plays for the Baltimore Ravens -- it likely would be dissed by dismissive critics as a simplistic white-liberal fantasy. (Itll be interesting to see how many reviewers wont be able to resist comparing the film with a certain other recent drama about an overweight illiterate African-American teen who transcends humble origins.) In fact the veracity of the storyline wont be enough to prevent some of the professionally outraged from accusing ""Blind Side"" of implying that underprivileged black folks must rely on rich well-intentioned white folks -- Leigh Ann is a successful interior decorator and her husband owns a gazillion fast-food restaurants -- to escape the slums and be all they can be. But what happened happened. And even though Hancock applies more than a smidge of sugar-coating to his dramatization ""The Blind Side"" remains involving affecting and for the most part emotionally honest. Better still the pic has an insightful and evenhanded view of racial and political realities in the contemporary South. Leigh Anne is disappointed but not entirely surprised by the not-so-veiled racism of her well-to-do-friends which the pic dutifully acknowledges. On the other hand Leigh Anne and Sean fleetingly own up to prejudices of their own after hiring a left-leaning tutor (zestfully played by Kathy Bates) for Michael. ""Who ever thought"" Sean remarks ""we would have a black son before we knew a Democrat?"" Newcomer Aaron gracefully treads a fine line playing Michael as neither dullard nor idiot savant but making him emotionally vulnerable painfully self-aware and surprisingly resilient. Better still Aaron more than holds his own opposite Bullock enabling the pic to come off as something far more rewarding and complex than a mere star vehicle. Country music superstar McGraw again evidences quietly impressive thesping ability while Collins and Head ably complete the family unit. Adriane Lenox makes every moment count in her brief but layered cameo as Michaels crack-addicted mom and actor-filmmaker Ray McKinnon demonstrates fine comic chops as a character who couldnt be more unlike the white-trash interloper he so memorably essays in ""That Evening Sun."" Tech values are first-rate with Atlanta locations adequately subbing for Memphis locales.

Susu says January 3 2015 at 303 pm Ive been reading lot of horrible comments that are based solely on the issues surrounding the movie rather than the movie itself. I wasnt excited to see this movie Im not interested in sports at all. The movie kept my attention though and well. It moved along quickly and pulled me into the story and left me feeling inspired. I wasnt excited to see a blonde sandy bullock in a sports movie I think thats what might have turned me off the most but she did really good job Its rare to see a movie where theres a really strong lead female character. Whether you like Leigh Anne Touhy or not in the end she is certainly entertaining and Sandra Bullock does a great job of bringing her onto the screen. The youngest son did an amazing job So much talent in him. The character of Mike I think could have used a few more lines even if hes supposed to be shy and reserved. All the actors really did a great job though for the most part. No its not an epic Oscar winning film although I wouldnt be surprised if Bullock got nominated for something for her acting. It is NOT loaded with propaganda as the other reviews might suggest. Its a light entertaining pick me up film that would be an excellent choice to bring the family to most likely the reason why they released it over the Holidays.
