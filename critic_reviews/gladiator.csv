That moment of pastoral beauty ends with a blunt cut to the grim weathered face of Roman general Maximus (Russell Crowe) whose expression tells us everything we need to know about his long campaign against the rebellious tribes of Germania. When his envoy sent to demand the northerners surrender comes galloping back as a headless horseman Maximus tells his troops ""On my command unleash hell."" In a ferocious 10-minute battle sequence with squadrons of flaming arrows napalm-like deluges of burning pitch and catapult-launched javelins that pin men to trees we learn all too clearly why the battle-weary general is haunted by thoughts of home. In the hands of director Ridley Scott (""Alien"" ""Blade Runner"") combat crashes over our heads like a sensory tidal wave. The Romans brutally vanquish the ""barbarians"" though from our vantage point theres not much difference between the two primitive armies that hack each other to bleeding moaning pieces. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) watches the chaos with weary regret. He has reigned for a quarter-century squandering all but a few years in battle. He worries about the judgment of history as he ends his days with the capital in a swirl of political instability. He charges Maximus with making Rome once again a representative republic. But the emperors son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is not about to surrender the throne he believes is his no matter how many lives stand in his way. An attack on Maximus and his family leaves the once-great hero a shattered anonymous slave. Purchased by Proximo (Oliver Reed) hes trained as a gladiator. Maximus dubbed the Spaniard moves through a series of increasingly horrific contests. The man who once fought for his nation and its ideals now fights to provide thrills to a bloodthirsty mob. Maximus despises the games. After one gory match he defiantly shouts ""Are you not entertained?"" Still he fights first in self-defense and later to shift the sympathy of the populace away from the newly crowned Commodus. Allied with him against the emperor are Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) Commodus sister who wants the throne for her own young son. AN INSIDE LOOK ""Gladiator"" is a triumph. On the surface its a terrific yarn with strong rounded characters agonizing suspense and visceral thrills. Look closer and youll find rich historical themes and a harrowing critique of violence as amusement. The mobs cheers make a chilling counterpoint to our closeup views of carnage. The film has its flaws to be sure. The computer-generated re-creation of the Coliseum -- about the size of the Rose Bowl -- looks far more grandiose than the real thing if this travelers memory is accurate. Hans Zimmers score is derivative of ""The Planets"" and often feels intrusive. The subplot of a love triangle between Maximus Lucilla and Commodus is unnecessary -- they have ample reason to conspire against one another without tossing frustrated incestuous lust into the mix. And the final showdown between Maximus and Commodus is hard to swallow. But Scott has done something miraculous in resurrecting the unfashionable sword-and-sandal genre without ever making it laughable. When Crowe salutes his soldiers with ""Strength and honor"" the dutiful words ring true in his mouth. Phoenix communicates the furious envy of a castoff son eager to destroy the man who replaced him in his fathers affections. What could have been a cardboard villain becomes a man who in other circumstances might have achieved great things. For all its trident-and-shield bravura ""Gladiator"" shows that the greatest victories and costliest losses are as internal as our minds and hearts.

Historically prohibitions on recreational purgation and rape made Rome better suited to the likes of Roger Corman than to Stanley Kubrick or Anthony Mann an otherwise muscular director whose lugubrious The Fall of the Roman Empire (and Fall and Fall . . . ) is merely one inspiration for director Ridley Scotts new film Gladiator. Written by David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson the epic pivots on the exploits of an undefeated general named Maximus (Russell Crowe) who dutifully serves one Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and incurs the enmity of another Marcus Aurelius son the dissolute Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Soon after the story opens Maximus a wealthy farmer on the verge of returning to the wife and son he has not seen for nearly three years is petitioned by Caesar to save Rome from itself by returning it to republican rule. Commodus thwarts his fathers plans with despotic flourish and Maximus ends up going mano a mano with a rainbow coalition in a North African coliseum then getting shipped off to Rome to distract the Coliseum masses. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its difficult to imagine a director who could give this sort of film and this sort of story both the necessary pop buoyancy and the digital realism that audiences have been trained to expect. The giddy at times queasy pleasures of choreographed movie gunplay of the sort that powers The Matrix or almost any John Woo film may drive anti-gun crusaders nuts but they are also irresistible. Watching bullets fall like rain relishing the pop pop pop of exquisitely crafted weaponry cradled in the embrace of a beautiful star is one of the pornographic rewards of modern moviegoing. Close the gap between a killer and his kill though -- swap the handgun for a mace the bullet hole for a pulpy gash -- and the violence is leached of both its ease and its facile pleasures. Which is what happens unexpectedly and no doubt unintentionally in Gladiator a film in which the inherent frisson of movie violence is continually negated by its horror by crushed heads and pulverized bodies delivered in unblinking close-up.If that sounds like a downer it is. Gladiator is filled with brilliant filmmaking and features outstanding performances but its neither profound enough nor pop enough to be great -- its mournful serious beautiful and finally pointless. Its primary reason for being seems to be the hunger of its releasing studio DreamWorks to replicate the box-office success of Saving Private Ryan. Indeed Scott has admitted to basing his opening battle scene an assault by the Roman legion on the Germanic tribes on Spielbergs re-creation of the Normandy landing; he employs the same staccato editing and drains out the color. The irony is that Scotts opening gambit -- with its swirling smoke fire flaming arrows galloping horses screaming hordes and a dog named Hell -- is greater more insistently cinematic than Spielbergs. Its the reason movies were invented and when its over bodies litter the field like kindling.By comparison Spielberg had it easy with his war epic a film after all about good guys leading the charge in the ""good war."" Theres nothing good about the Roman Empire circa A.D. 180 and nothing good about Commodus or the fallen general who has dedicated his life to death. What makes Maximus appealing at least as far as the screenwriters would have us believe is that he becomes a slave and as a consequence transforms from an official bully into an underdog. (Curiously along with Amistad and The Prince of Egypt Gladiator makes the third movie about slaves produced by DreamWorks in as many years. Can The Gulag Archipelago be far behind?) Maximus however makes an improbable sympathy case even if hes meant to be stricken with the existential loneliness that haunts most of Ridley Scotts heroes -- the duelists Ripley Deckard Louise (though not Thelma) -- and that keeps each alone in an otherwise crowded universe.

Sep. 13 600pm When Maximus stares longingly at the effigies of his wife and child its supposed to bring forth another reality for him a world outside the arena in much the same way that the tinfoil unicorn does for Deckard in Blade Runner. But theres only one reality for Maximus that of gore and churning hate and no matter how much Scott borrows from Blade Runner he cant summon up the hurting human emotions that transformed that genre picture into a masterpiece. Scott is rummaging freely through the archives in Gladiator; in addition to Saving Private Ryan and Blade Runner he also samples from Paths of Glory. His most startling allusion though is his introduction of Rome which begins with a view of the city glimpsed through cloud cover narrows in on a statue of an eagle and culminates with symmetrical columns of soldiers -- a precis of the major visual motifs in Leni Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will.The Riefenstahl quotation seems to be there as a thematic cue but its hard not to feel that all this borrowing is an indication that the director is distracted perhaps even bored with the material. Hes uninterested in most of the intimate exchanges but rouses himself for the fight sequences -- the first coliseum brawl is stunning -- and for his key performers. He unleashes the late Oliver Reed who ridiculous and hugely entertaining as a gladiator wrangler fills in the hollows of his character with the ease of a professional whos swaggered through bad movies and good. With his meaty anatomy and rough-trade appeal Crowe makes a persuasive thug -- even when hes just walking he seems to be pounding the ground with rage. His isnt a graceful body or a particularly subtle performance but Crowe isnt an actor who likes to betray his delicacy -- hes strongest or at least most comfortable playing angry. Best of all is Joaquin Phoenix an interesting actor who dazzles as Commodus. Whether hes sizing up his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) or staring down an enemy senator the young actor seems to be channeling Charles Laughton at his most poignantly louche. His modest jowls dont tremble as expressively as Laughtons did and his lips dont glisten with as much rapacious promise but theres something in the way he makes Commodus frightening and vulnerable at once that recalls how Laughton always managed to turn his villains into martyrs of their own cruelty.Gladiator isnt an impersonal exercise -- its filled with Scotts visual flourishes and obsessions but whats missing is his characteristic sense of urgency. The directors films are invariably pitched between extraordinary spectacle and ramrod storytelling (many of his films feature characters on the run existentially or physically). But epics are hard to move -- theyre ponderous by their very nature. The filmmaking in Gladiator is state of the art and there are moments when its better than that moments of breathtaking brutal lyricism. The story that Scott signed on to however is predictable formulaic and there are too many instances when as with misadventures such as Legend he seems thwarted instead of enlivened by the constraints of genre. By the time the Roman crowd fattened on bread and distracted by carnage lowers its collective thumb its clear that this bloody doleful epic isnt about swords sandals or even slavery but the tyranny of genre filmmaking itself. Its no wonder we cant wait for Maximus to get back in the ring -- neither can Scott. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Manohla Dargis Follow L.A.

In general I loathe anyones mucking about with the classics--""The Bacchae"" staged in a Turkish colored-glass factory Oedipus as a visually impaired hockey coach etc.--but I was at first charmed and then to my amazement gripped by Michael Almereydas restaging of the play. Its true that this Hamlet (Ethan Hawke) a bedraggled slacker in a knit cap recites ""To be or not to be"" in a video store and washes Poloniuss blood-soaked clothes in a laundromat. (The movie is very downtown in its resentments and occasional squalor.) But Almereydas ""Hamlet"" is decidedly not a travesty.... This is a movie about a depressed Hamlet though the adaptation itself has a mischievous and stinging intelligence and its own kind of sullen beauty. Carter Burwells menacing neo-electronic music floats over the flat surfaces and bland handsomeness of the high-rise apartments and offices which are both glamorous and unyielding in their lack of comfort. The movie is visually both brilliant and dark featuring the strong blacks of the power city at night and strong reds too drawn from the roses associated with Gertrudes sexual awakening and from the blood-soaked denouement which staged along an open terrace high above the streets mixes sword and gunplay. This ""Hamlet"" may be closer to inspired collage than to poetic drama but it releases the old fable with its emotional force intact. The adolescent Hamlet struggling to exist seems as palpable and fleshy as the others only in death... ""Up at the Villa"" the new film by Philip and Belinda Haas (""Angels and Insects"") plays as smoothly as vintage wine but the material adapted from a Somerset Maugham novella substitutes worldliness for drama and the Haases seem not to realize that there might be something wrong with that... The Haases are trying to make a popular movie without developing the ingredients that make movies popular... In ""Gladiator""Ridley Scott thrusts us so close to the combat that all we see is a lot of whirling and thrashing a sword thrust here and there a spurt of blood a limb severed. Theres hardly a scene that is cleanly and coherently staged in open space. The violence comes mainly from the editing in the cheapening use of montage. We see this sort of flamboyant mess all the time in the movies but almost no one complains--perhaps because we have become so accustomed to spatially incoherent movement in commercials and on MTV that it now looks normal... ""U-571"" is brought off with conviction and skill. Even if we know how things are going to turn out we are pulled as taut as a bowstring by people who respect us enough not to tease us with fakery.

Crowe received a Golden Globe best dramatic actor nomination for his role in the Roman epic. (AP) BY Jami Bernard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday May 5 2000 1200 AM GLADIATOR. With Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix Connie Nielsen Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott. At area theaters. Running time 154 mins. Rated R Gory violence incest theme. 3 1/2 Stars. If theres a soft spot in your heart for the sword-amp;-sandal epic - and from the star rating above I think you can guess where I stand - then youll swoon with giddy delight over ""Gladiator"" a sweaty stylish hunkfest that takes you back to the days of ""Ben-Hur"" ""Spartacus"" and the so recently departed Steve Reeves. From his biceps to his gluteus Maximus is maximus. This Roman general turned slave turned gladiator hasnt a shred of humor but then he doesnt have time for idle nonsense when hes lopping off heads all day. (The head-lopping is apparently his signature like the mark of Zorro.) In director Ridley Scotts thrilling burnished epic Maximus no sooner serves the empire by leveling Germania during a snowstorm than Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) tosses him a promotion he doesnt want - to succeed the aged emperor and whip Rome back into shape. All Maximus wants is to go home to his wife and child in the suburbs. The careworn Russell Crowe is physically and temperamentally perfect for the part of Maximus. Still carrying some of the weight he packed on for ""The Insider"" hes no gym-toned pretty boy. Hes solid beefy rough-hewn creaking along in his heavy leather costume with a look on his puss of weary disdain. What makes him sexy is his sense of honor and loyalty ""What we do in life echoes in eternity"" Anyway it cant be his hygiene although he is frequently bathed in a sanctifying golden glow. After a coup by the emperors weak-kneed son Commodus (a whiny surprisingly fleshy Joaquin Phoenix) Maximus fortunes change. He winds up being thrown to the tigers two shows daily in Romes Colosseum the entertainment complex of its day. Crowe like his character must grimly come to terms with the fact that actor or gladiator its all about showmanship. Give the crowd what it wants either at the multiplex or in the arena and you can write your own ticket. ""I have power only to amuse the mob"" he spits contemptuously like a Shakespearean actor reduced to dinner theater. The plot about avenging honor provides brief respite between an array of hand-to-hand battles that are pitched so furiously that individual components barely register; theyre subliminal suggestions of computer-assisted carnage with Jackson Pollock sprays of blood. For fans of the genre yes this is a good thing. Connie Nielsen plays Commodus sister and possible love interest for Maximus once his family is dispatched (politics you know). Nielsens costumes are laced up like bondage gear and there is a tantalizing hint of romance past. But the camera only has eyes for Crowe. The glowering The seething The hooded gaze The quiet suffering (Watch him carve away a tattoo he no longer has use for. No anesthetic No disinfectant) The supporting cast makes for a gauntlet of worthy friends and adversaries all of them thinkers including Derek Jacobi (""I Claudius"") as a senator Djimon Hounsou (""Amistad"") as a fellow gladiator and Oliver Reed who died with two days to go on the shoot looking a little woozy as a gladiator entrepreneur. Reeds character is the one most in touch with the movies premise - that entertainment is the goal and a worthy one at that.

Throughout this captivating movie Scott builds a bridge between the beginning of the first millennium and the end of the second.As the brilliantly staged opening battle between the forces of the ailing emperor Marcus Aurelius and Teutonic barbarians brings home the Romans had mastered their world and yet were powerless to stop the inexorable self-inflicted slide toward chaos and darkness.The narrative follows the fate of a man who needs all his strength and resolve to cling to the course of honor - a twisted path that changes direction with the tide of events that overwhelm him.The depiction of the random savagery amid which the issue has to be confronted is astonishing. The dizzying virtuosity of Gladiators action sequences ranks with the storied first 25 minutes of Saving Private Ryan and they share the same elegiac quality.Nearing death and rightly fearing for the future of Rome the emperor chooses his favorite general Maximus (Russell Crowe) over his half-crazed son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Maximus who has never even been to Rome wants no part of the offer and yearns to return to his wife and son in Spain. There he finds them brutally executed by his rival and he is taken prisoner by slavers who sell him to a gladiator school in the provinces.Gladiator is full of arresting splendor and technical virtuosity on a plane beyond the imagining of the makers of this kind of epic in the 60s. But its impact as a movie flows from Russell Crowe who is that rarity a great actor who is fully up to the demands of playing a man of action.When Maximus exhorts ""Strength and honor"" to his men as they prepare for battle it amounts to a lengthy soliloquy. Crowes performance comes from an instinctive mastery of look and gesture and a powerful physical presence. It makes words almost superfluous and is in perfect tune with the fast pace of the film.The figure of Maximus asked to sacrifice himself for the good of the state is an archetype the Romans themselves counted as truly heroic and it surfaces in many other myths and legends.But in this case Maximus brought down from high honor to fight for his life has every reason to scorn the people he is supposed to save from encroaching collapse represented by Commodus.It is a dilemma that complicates the desire for vengeance on the new emperor that drives him. Unlike so many of the epics Hollywood churned out four decades ago Maximus makes his decisions in a totally pagan environment. Christianity and the sentimental pieties of a movie like The Robe are absent.Scotts credentials as a visual artist were proven in Alien and Blade Runner and Maximus world is brilliantly realized.Oliver Reed who died when the filming was almost completed gives a splendid valedictory as Proximo the worldly promoter who buys and trains Maximus. Derek Jacobi offers a note of sanity as Gracchus the senator brave enough to oppose Commodus. And Phoenix a daring piece of casting against type shuns the old-school scenery-chewing stereotype of the mad emperor to give us a lost soul of fickle cunning and vindictiveness.The fusion of the ancient and the modern - even to the point of some sly echoes of our own sports-mad society - is seamless. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome but it also clinically dissects the assumptions on which it was built.GLADIATOR     Produced by Douglas Wick David Franzoni and Branko Lustig; directed by Ridley Scott; written by Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson; photography by John Mathieson; music by Hans Zimmer; distributed by DreamWorks Pictures.Running time 2 hours 35 mins.Maximus..........Russell CroweCommodus.........Joaquin PhoenixLucilla..........Connie NielsenProximo..........Oliver ReedGracchus.........Derek JacobiParents guide R (violence)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Films dealing with adventure and high drama in antiquity were cinematic fixtures pretty much from the inception of moviemaking through their burnout in the 60s. Now seemingly out of nowhere Ridley Scotts Gladiator finds Russell Crowe donning sword and sandals to enter the world of chariot races effete Caesars and suspiciously British-sounding senators. Its a welcome if familiar return to one of cinemas more dubious genres. A Cinemascope epic retrofitted for the CGI age Gladiator combines the autumnal Rome setting of The Fall Of The Roman Empire with the gladiatorial theatrics and populist politics of Spartacus and the nobleman-made-lowly plot of Ben-Hur. Crowe stars as a Roman general under the command of philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). After Crowe defeats an encroaching barbarian horde in an exciting opening sequence Harris decides to make him the protectorate of Rome during its transition back to a Republic a decision that doesnt sit well with scheming son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix in a campy part at least partially informed by Malcolm McDowells turn in Caligula but nonetheless not as crazy as the real Commodus). Phoenix orders Crowes execution a fate he escapes in just enough time to return home to find his family viciously murdered. Shortly thereafter he is abducted by slave traders becomes a gladiator and sets about seeking revenge. Virtually nothing here hasnt been done before but its been a while and that makes all the difference. Scotts visual sense gets a great workout from the various imperial settings the action sequences enthrall Crowe is a compelling lead (its hard to imagine Gladiator working with anyone else) and the films digital re-creations of everything from the Colosseum to actor Oliver Reed (who died during shooting) rank among the most impressive uses of the technology to date. In the end Gladiator is overdrawn and too insubstantial for its own good just like the old days but it satisfies as entertainment on a grand scale.

"Crapus Maximus Slate Sign In Sign Up Crapus Maximus Crapus Maximus Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 5 2000 930 PM Crapus Maximus Gladiator dissolves into bloody incoherent porridge. Timecode splices the avant-garde with the entertaining. By David Edelstein GladiatorDirected by Ridley Scott DreamWorks Distribution TimecodeDirected by Mike Figgis Screen Gems Entertainment ""At my signal unleash hell"" intones Gen. Maximus (Russell Crowe) the hero of this turgid slab of big-budget bloodletting called Gladiator. Whats odd is that Maximus is the movies man of peace Hed rather be tilling the soil on his farm in Spain--""the smell of herbs in the day jasmine in the evening""--and kicking back under a night sky thats ""black like my wifes hair"" than out at the far end of the Roman Empire cleaving infidels in twain. But as one Roman officer puts it ""Some people dont know when theyre conquered."" So Maximus must stifle his agrarian longings and do his duty by the empire burying his big sword in sundry heathens for the sake of the greater good. After all this altruistic hacking and beheading how does the jealous new emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) honor the sterling military leader? By dispatching goons to kill him and to crucify his wife and little son. And how does Maximus respond? This might be ancient Rome but some things are eternal Advertisement Its tempus paybackus. The road to Rome is greased with gore and Im not just being lyrical. Our Maximus gets scraped off the ground and sold to a showman named Proximo (Oliver Reed) whos the P.T. Barnum of Roman circuses. (""I shall be closer to you in the next few days than your bitch of a mother when you were in the womb."") So the ex-general enters the Coliseum as a notorious gladiator called The Spaniard in a masked get-up not too dissimilar from the costumes worn by our own more histrionic pro wrestlers. Unlike those guys however Maximus isnt big on pointing and gnashing his teeth. He simply wants to hack and behead his way up to the emperor then meet up with junior and the missus in that big farm in the sky. Now thats entertainment. Look Im as much of a bloodthirsty Roman as the next male moviegoer. Ive sat through entire Jean-Claude Van Damme pictures on pay cable (never on the regular channels with the blood laundered out--what would be the point?). But Gladiators combination of grim sanctimony and drenching Dolby-ized dismemberings left me appalled. The filmmakers--screenwriters David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson; and the director Ridley Scott--clearly wanted to make an old-fashioned sword-and-sandal epic with state-of-the-art brutality. They couldnt go as far as they wanted and keep their ""R"" rating so the violence comes in split-second splattery bursts--multiple spears piercing breastplates torsos getting bisected heads whirling off. Advertisement Sam Peckinpah might have made something coherent even exhilarating of these battles and even connected emotionally with the pictures paranoid scenario. (Hed have loved all the betrayals.) But Ridley Scott has always been better at foreplay than action His best film Alien (1979) is mostly one long tracking shot to the gurgling sounds of an upset stomach. The most evocative stuff in Gladiator comes before the first big battle the clank-clank-clank of primitive spear-lobbers being wound the arrows being lit the soldiers rising from their prayers into a milkily luminous mist. But once the hand-to-hand combat begins the film turns into a bloody porridge. Theres lots of arrhythmic slow motion and a strange rotoscopic flickering that signals either bogus acceleration or computer tinkering. (A lot of this movie was generated by computer including 33000 of the 35000 Coliseum extras.) You cant tell whos stabbing whom but theres no avoiding the sound of swords going kerchunk into flesh while blood spritzes merrily up into the frame. (Those computer animators were clearly having themselves a party.) Virtuoso direction might have helped Gladiator but it wouldnt have saved it It would still be a Rambo movie manque combining the worst of Cecil B. DeMille with the crudest elements of The Road Warrior (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). Ive seen subtler characterizations in Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson kickboxing pictures. Could this villain Commodus--the name sounds like Latin for ""of the latrine""--be any more repulsive? When hes not lusting after his sister (Connie Nielsen) hes gazing lasciviously on her little son. Commodus snivels about not having had his fathers love but what we register isnt his humanity but his lisping effeminacy his heavy brow and his off-center philtrum. (Phoenixs peculiar physiognomy makes him an interesting hero but a too-obvious bad guy.) By the end hes like Ernst Blofeld crossed with some psychotic movie mogul. Before absurdly leaping into the arena with Maximus he actually savors the films ad line ""The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story ..."" The mogul comparison isnt accidental. Gladiator plays the postmodern game of having its characters moralize about its own fascist aesthetic as when a patrician senator (Derek Jacobi) complains that Commodus might be a successful emperor because he ""distracts [the mob] brings them death and they love him for it. He reaches people through brutality."" And Proximo tells Maximus that if he wins the crowd he will win his freedom ""Thrust this [sword] into another mans flesh and then they will applaud and love you."" Are the screenwriters telling us were no better than the Roman mob? I dont think so. I think theyre trying to stroke us to remind us that were actually more evolved We dont root indiscriminately; we root for the good guys. And that blood on screen isnt real Well I felt sated blood-drunk and annoyed at myself for staying until the risible climax. True I wanted to see the last of Oliver Reed who died during shooting and whose impish turn might be his slyest and subtlest. (OK its subtle in the context of Gladiator.) And Russell Crowe is no disgrace. Noting that the actor went from the gauche chunky Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider (1999) to the strapping warrior of Gladiator with little change in affect director Ridley Scott praised Crowes ability to ""internalize"" his parts. Id argue less kindly that in Crowes case the clothes really do make the man. But I dont want to be too flip. The actor works hard and appears to be taking this material seriously. His dogged realism keeps the picture from drifting into Victor Mature-style camp--a mixed blessing from my point of view although not I imagine from DreamWorks. Advertisement A random observation The hearing of humans was apparently much more acute 2000 years ago. In the Coliseum Maximus and Commodus softly hiss at each other and the 35000 Romans in attendance appear to pick up every word and register every nuance. Whereas we poor 21st-century sods need THX Dolby Surround Sound out of 50 speakers to register someone getting disemboweled with a broadsword. C olleagues of mine snicker when I admit to a love for the whole of Mike Figgisoeuvre including the embarrassing missteps--i.e. most of his movies. Ive heard him likened to a tedious doctoral student but if he sometimes writes like a structuralist pointy-head he directs like a breathless child who cant stop piling on perspectives who wishes he could be in four different places at once. With Timecode he has gotten his wish and the upshot is a triumph--a movie thats not only both challenging and entertaining its entertaining because its challenging. As youve doubtless heard Figgis splits the screen into four squares each of which contains 90 minutes of uninterrupted footage from a digital video camera. Four of those cameras simultaneously tracked his large ensemble cast in and around a fictional Los Angeles production company--not unlike the one that produced Figgis second-to-last flop. He gave the actors a story and let them improvise their lines but the movie isnt as dull as most improvs because Figgis has four possible soundtracks to sample and he directs our attention by raising the volume on one screen or another. (If Timecode makes the editor unnecessary it makes the sound editor twice as important.) In Figgis view--partially voiced by an avant-garde filmmaker (Mia Maestro) pitching a similar film to the onscreen production company before she veers off into unintelligible BS--digital video wont simply give the option of near-professional moviemaking to anyone who can afford a camera. It can also make it easier to have multiple protagonists and perspectives on the same event. Youre ""distanced""--how could you not be? And you miss a lot. (I still havent figured out the connections between some of the characters.) But once you get used to moving your head up and down and back and forth you might start to groove (theres no other word for it) on seeing different things happening in different places at the exact same instant--a point Figgis drives home by having all the characters shaken periodically by earthquakes. In one corner you might have the rich jealous Jeanne Tripplehorn smooching with Salma Hayek; in another Julian Sands (an insolent actorish type amusingly cast as a masseur) caressing someones feet; in another Saffron Burrows blabbing to therapist Glenne Headly about her crumbling marriage; and in the last her husband Stellan Skarsgard the dissolute head of the company stumbling into a meeting with his executives (among them the wonderful Holly Hunter Xander Berkeley and Steven Weber). Sometimes the cameras end up in the same room and the effect is surprisingly delightful--another angle on the same place Characters in one frame talk via cell phone to characters in other frames. Tripplehorn plants a bug on Hayek who has sex behind a movie screen with Skarsgard while her horrified lover listens. Were in both places at once and two others besides. So why do we need four cameras? Cant you just cut back and forth between Hayek and Skarsgard going at it and Tripplehorn listening in her limo with headphones? Sure. But somehow seeing it all without cuts at the exact same instant creates an element of danger that you dont get in overprocessed modern movies--the kind where 33000 of 35000 coliseum dwellers are added in months later by computer. The joy on Tripplehorns face as she walks down the street at the end goes beyond mere acting. She has been through something and her relief at having come out the other side is palpable. As the light on the four frames fades you can almost hear the sighs and whoops and someone saying ""And now its Miller time.""

Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"" Compiled from Wired Dispatches Time for a little gladiatorial gore with your Milk Duds. ""Gladiator"" is here and its big glorious and eminently dumb. For the first time since the 1960s Hollywood revisits the Roman Empires equivalent of Monday Night Football hand-to-hand bloodletting in an arena full of savagely rabid spectators. The best this glitzy but soulless epic merits is a mixed reception - say thumbs sideways - from the moviegoing hordes. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien"" ""Thelma and Louise"") fashions an awesome spectacle with a stunning computer-generated Colosseum that shows just how far Hollywood has come technically since the days of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus."" Despite Russell Crowes glowering presence as Roman general Maximus what ""Gladiator"" lacks is the heart and humanity of those earlier Roman pageants. Scott lets action and architecture - both real and digitized - overwhelm the characters and their leaden dialogue. ""My name is Gladiator"" Maximus mechanically musters when confronted by the young emperor who has wronged him a dull echo of the heroically emotive ""Im Spartacus"" scene from Stanley Kubricks classic. In place of the subtle characterizations that Hollywood once crafted to bring grace and charm to brutal Rome Scott goes for the jugular at every turn. Maximus wife and son arent just slain by his enemies theyre crucified and set afire while alive. The sick little puppy of an emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) doesnt just taunt Maximus he informs the fallen general that ""your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross and your wife moaned like a whore as they ravaged her again and again and again."" The Colosseum crowds dont just applaud the carnage they cheer gleefully at every severed appendage. If this was the glory of ancient Rome thank Olympus its in ruins. The story War-weary Maximus hopes to retire to his farm after one final campaign against barbarians for his dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus has other plans tapping Maximus as protector of Rome to keep the emperors snot-nosed son Commodus off the throne. ""Commodus is not a moral man. He must not rule"" Marcus tells Maximus. ""Youre the son I should have had."" Theres a moment early on between Marcus and Commodus from which ""Gladiator"" could have evolved into a full-bodied drama. But the touching scene of father and son examining their failed relationship degenerates into brute ugliness and the movie takes the bestial low road from then on. Commodus does come to power ordering the deaths of Maximus and his family. Maximus escapes trains as a gladiator and plots revenge when Commodus reopens the Colosseum for bloody games to celebrate his ascension and keep the people blissfully pacified. Scotts approach to the complex politics of Rome is as simplistic as his characters. After one kick-butt fight in the arena Maximus wins the adoration of Romes citizens who start turning against Commodus with boos and hisses. And its just a matter of time before the showdown between Maximus and Commodus with hype as silly as a professional-wrestling championship. Crowe does rise a notch above the movies muscle-over-mind sensibility. The actor can brood with the best of them; he compensates for the scripts shortcomings by bringing a sense of the inner remorse and self-blame of a man whose public life has come home to torment those he loves. Harris in his fleeting role as Marcus and the late Oliver Reed in his final role as gladiator trainer Proximo offer the only other human sparks in a parade of characters as lifeless as the computer-generated spectators Scott used to fill the colosseum to capacity. The movie is an orgy for the eyes though. Elaborate sets costumes and digital imagery blend to create an unparalleled vista of Roman splendor notably in Commodus coronation march into Rome a perverse inauguration reminiscent of a Nuremberg rally. The opening battle scene is effectively dreamlike with a rain of fire bombs that lives up to Maximus exhortation to ""unleash hell."" The arena fights however suffer from Scotts machine-gun jump cuts which sometimes obscure the action and also thankfully some of the gore. Conquering the box-office ""Gladiator"" came saw and conquered the box office since its release two weeks ago. The Roman epic which stars Australian actor Russell Crowe as a general sold into slavery as a sword-wielding fighter at the Colosseum earned an estimated  32.7 million during last week. Playing at 2938 theatres in USA it averaged  11130 per site easily the highest score in the top 10. Director Ridley Scotts  103 million movie earned more than the next six films combined. The only other wide new release was Kim Basingers ""I Dreamed of Africa"" which opened at No. 8 with a disappointing  2.5 million and an  1184 average. Based on initial polling the audience for the R-rated ""Gladiator"" skewed 25 years and over DreamWorks said. Last Friday females made up 35 percent of the audience; Saturday they comprised 45 percent indicating strong word-of-mouth among a demographic less than taken with the films bloody heroics.DreamWorks distribution president Jim Tharp said the film had ""a very high emotional level"" which attracted women. ""It was a huge challenge (to bring women in) and I think it will continue to be a challenge"" he said. Box office analyst Gitesh Pandya at boxofficeguru.com said the opening figure was ""quite strong"" given the films rating and 150-minute running time. The record for an R-rated opener is Harrison Fords ""Air Force One"" which took off with about 37 million in 1997. ""Gladiator"" is a co-production between privately held DreamWorks SKG which is distributing it throughout the United States and Canada and Seagram Co.

"Russell Crowe in a Toga but Not a Single Orgy | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Russell Crowe in a Toga but Not a Single Orgy By Andrew Sarris  05/08/00 1200am Ridley Scotts Gladiator  from a screenplay by David Franzoni and John Logan and William Nicholson has been hailed in some quarters as a triumphant restoration of the long dormant toga-and-tunic superproduction genre that seemingly faded into oblivion with the critical and commercial failures of Anthony Manns The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) and George Stevens The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). Indeed Gladiator bears a strong resemblance in its anachronistically liberal sentiments and character alignments to The Fall of the Roman Empire  which marked instead the fall of offshore producer Samuel Bronstons Spain-based empire in the bankruptcy courts. Hence I suspect that graybeard critics look back instead to the genres comparative glory days with William Wylers Oscar-winning Ben-Hur (1959) and Stanley Kubricks cult-favored-and-flavored Spartacus (1960). I have never been particularly fond of historical and Biblical spectacles preferring as I do D.W. Griffiths True Heart Susie (1919) to his Intolerance (1916); Cecil B. De Milles The Cheat (1915) to his The Ten Commandments (1923); and Abel Gances La Roue (1923) to his Napoleon (1927) though that is admittedly a close call. The point is that I am an extreme case in favoring intimacy over scope in the cinema. Two people talking away their share of eternity passionately dramatically decisively and intelligently excites me more than all the legions of Rome and Germania in Gladiator . Still I did want almost desperately to like Gladiator despite my genre prejudice-if only to help make Russell Crowe a big star to go along with his being just about the best movie actor around in the past few years. Indeed if I had been the emperor of the Motion Picture Academy Mr. Crowe would have had two Oscars by now for his portrayals in Michael Manns The Insider (1999) and Curtis Hansons L.A. Confidential (1997). Hence at the very least I hoped that Gladiator would get Mr. Crowe an Oscar in the way Charlton Heston got his for Ben-Hur after not even being considered in 1958 for a superior job in Orson Welles Touch of Evil . To be as kind as I can to Mr. Crowe I can say that he manages to make Gladiator only intermittently tedious and if that isnt damning with faint praise I dont know what is. In fact Gladiator is just teeming with negative virtues. It is almost never campy or derisively decadent by post-pagan Suetonian standards. There are no orgies even in this post-censorship era of permissiveness with respect to nudity and simulated carnal congress. Consequently the R rating has nothing to do with sex and everything to do with violence of which there is a considerable amount though it is never grossly or tastelessly sustained for exploitation purposes. Oddly there is no male skin-show with Mr. Crowe as there was with Mr. Heston in Ben-Hur and Kirk Douglas in Spartacus . By contrast Mr. Crowe in Gladiator is usually encased in either armor or fur-lined coats. He looks shorter and slighter than most of his adversaries either in battle as the empires commanding general Maximus or after he has been nearly murdered by the Emporer Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) as the slave-gladiator known as ""the Spaniard."" Lacking the buff physique of Mr. Heston or Mr. Douglas Mr. Crowe internalizes the narcissism associated with roles of superhuman strength and courage. Will todays fans of the World Wrestling Federation identify with a more cerebral action figure? Only time and the box office will tell. If I seem to have backed into telling you the ""story"" of Gladiator  it is because I think it is the least of the films negative virtues. Richard Harris plays the emperor Marcus Aureliuswho lives long enough to tell Maximus that he not the emperors foppish son Commodus will lead Rome back to being a republic. When he unwisely tells his son Commodus proceeds to murder his father and order the execution of Maximus his wife and his little boy. The rest is standard Jacobean revenge melodrama diluted by the usual movie-hero hesitations and soul-saving scruples. Yet Gladiator resists bringing in the Christians of 180 A.D. as civilizing influences on the wickedly pagan Romans thus forfeiting its Easter-time bookings on television for decades to come. Instead the avatar of reform in Rome is the Senate led by Derek Jacobis incorruptible Gracchus who looks with elitist disdain on the cruel Roman circuses so loved by the ""mob."" The model for which Maximus and Gracchus risk their lives is the kind of secular republic that concentrates its attention on the domestic issues like sanitation and plague control. As evil as Commodus may be he is at least more entertaining and media savvy with his frequent crowd-pleasing spectacles featuring bread and circuses. Yes we actually see loaves of bread being thrown into the stands by the emperors charioteers certainly a forerunner of todays high-Nielsen-rated quiz shows. The late Oliver Reed is almost unrecognizable in the prominent role of Proximo the gladiatorial promoter who serves as the heros mentor. The film is deservedly dedicated to this memorable trouper who lived not wisely but too well. Two subplots involving Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) the terrified sister of Commodus and an old flame of Maximus and Juba (Djimon Hounsou) the heros closest friend in gladiatorial captivity add to the number of sympathetic characters arrayed against Commodus who is not shown as even marginally gay in the stereotyped manner of previous imperial villains. Ultimately Gladiator is an honorable and inoffensive spectacle with nothing extraordinary to recommend it. An Eye for an Eye Anthony Stark and Sean Smiths Into My Heart  from their own screenplay is as minimus as Gladiator is maximus. Costing at most a hundredth as much Into My Heart manages to be low-key in the best sense of the term which is to say that it packs a wallop without losing its cool. Its directorial style is unobtrusive without its effect becoming indistinct and its characters grow and change without being twisted out of shape by facile contrivances. The title of the film is derived from a somber poem by A.E. Housman ""Into my heart an air that kills/ From yon far country blows/ What are those blue remembered hills/ What spires what farms are those?/ That is the land of lost content/ I see it shining plain/ The happy highways where I went/ And cannot come again."" Rob Morrows Ben and Jake Webers Adam have been best friends since childhood ""Like two olives in a martini"" in the words of Adams father. Yet they are strikingly and ultimately tragically different in temperament. Adam is a romantically naive idealist Ben a casually careless cynic. From the first moments we see them together there is a shadow over their friendship in the form of a black patch over one of Adams eyes. It is the result of a childhood accident caused at least partly by Bens negligence and the guilt has never ceased to weigh on him despite Adams reassurances. After going to a preppy boarding school together they both go on to Columbia and at the local watering hole the famous and notorious West End Gate Adam begins a romance with a student-waitress named Nina (Claire Forlani). She almost immediately assumes the role of the great love of his life while Ben looks on with mildly unbelieving amusement mixed with genuine concern that Adam has never developed any ""emotional scar tissue"" and is thereby dangerously vulnerable to heart-breaking disillusionment. Hence while Ben accepts the adulteries and prospective divorce of his own parents Adam is shocked at the idea that married people can ever be unfaithful to each other. Yet it is Ben who finds himself after a series of troubled temporary relationships in college with a marriage that is conspicuously less idyllic than that of Adam and Nina. When the two couples gather for a reunion Adam and Nina cannot help noticing that Ben is not entirely happy with his super-career-woman wife Kat (Jayne Brook). For his part Ben is deeply jealous of his friends for what he perceives is a storybook marriage. Yet at the first opportunity Nina forgets her marriage vows to enter with Ben what starts out as an almost hypothetical adventure and ends up with tragic and life-altering consequences for the foursome. The story is told in a series of one-scene blackouts so artfully composed and sequenced that the effect is more cinematic than theatrical. A single act of betrayal becomes the detonator for all the emotional havoc that follows; to the very end much is left unsaid but little is left unfelt. The easy rapport established between the cast members is a sign of non-star professionalism honed mostly on television. Comment Filed under At the Movies Emporer Commodus Maximus Inc.

Comments (1) Gladiator Russell Crowe stars as a Roman general asked by the dying emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to take over as ruler. The emperors wrathful son (Joaquin Phoenix) promptly orders the execution of the general and his family; surviving as a gladiator the general fights his way back to Rome to take revenge and restore justice in the Colosseum. Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies Ridley Scotts sword-and-sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling spectacle and violence--Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed make especially strong contributions. But dont expect anything as good as Spartacus or as enjoyably silly as Quo Vadis? The script by producer David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson is serviceable but not exactly inspired. 154 min.

Ailing Marcus Aurelius (Harris) would like his favourite soldier and confidant to take over and pass power to the Senate. His heir however - the insecure Commodus (Phoenix) - feels miffed by the slight. Having ensured dad dies in his arms the new Emperor exerts his murderous authority. But Maximus wont swear loyalty and after a narrow escape the enslaved ex-general bent on vengeance gets a chance to return to Rome as a gladiator. Scotts sword and sandal spectacular is a bloody good yarn packed with epic pomp and pageantry dastardly plots massed action and forthright fundamental emotions. That said for all the efforts to suggest authenticity it stays true to peplum tradition not only in its age old cliches but in saying as much about our era as that in which its set. The implausibly efficient carnage of the opening battle evokes post-Nam war movies; Maximus improbably swift deep bonding with an African slave lends a whiff of PC historicity; Commoduss vices arise from poor parental care. Still the cast is strong (notably Nielsen as Commoduss vacillating sister and the late Oliver Reed unusually endearing as a gladiator owner) the pacing lively and the sets swordplay and Scud catapults impressive.

Rick Groen RICK GROEN Film Critic Published Friday May 05 2000 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 418PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Directed by Ridley Scott Written by David Franzoni John Logan William Nicholson Starring Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix Connie Nielsen Classification AA Rating  The Roman costume drama all dressed to the IXs has taken a long holiday from the big screen. Decades have passed since the likes of Spartacus and Ben-Hur and Cleopatra conjured up fond remembrances of spectacles past. Whos to blame for the genres decline and fall? Not us I think. As evident in televisions success with I Claudius along with its modern-day equivalent in The Sopranos the public still has a hearty appetite for the overstuffed doings and the continuing legacy of ancient Rome. Instead the real culprit may just be simple economics -- that cast of thousands got to be prohibitively expensive. And now it isnt. All hail the advent of ""computer-graphic imaging"" -- a mere click of the mouse and voila instant hordes an electronically produced mob of apparently human extras. Bearing that in mind welcome back to antiquity with the coming of Gladiator a picture that surely benefits from the genres extended absence. As with the return of any long-lost friend the tendency is to focus on the strengths and initially at least gloss over the weaknesses. The upside? Visually polished credibly acted and competently directed courtesy of Ridley Scott the film is always likable. The downside? Well its never anything more than likable. At more than 21/2 hours its epic in length but not in substance -- the narrative is content to complete a basic heroic arc in the form of a stock revenge quest. Theres not much texture or subtlety; the imperial purple comes in a single shade. What you see is exactly what you get. And what you see aint bad. We pick up the action far from Rome on the scorched-earth of Germania where the brave General Maximus (Russell Crowe) and his efficient legionnaires are in the process of routing those stubborn barbarians. Although the battle is pitched the outcome is certain. Equipped with infinitely superior firepower -- flaming arrows pummelling catapults charging steeds -- the forces of civilization engineer a brutal and merciless triumph. Watching the victory the aging emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is quick to salute Maximus and even quicker to kick-start the plot. You see like so many philosopher kings Aurelius is determined to do in his dotage what he would never have done in his prime Relinquish the emperors powers and give over the republic to a strengthened Senate. Naturally this idea doesnt sit well with his son and heir Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) who puts an abrupt end to both the heresy and the heretic then immediately pronounces a death sentence upon the popular Maximus and his entire family. Escaping his executioners but not a roving band of slave-traders our man soon gets sold to Proximo (Oliver Reed). Think of him as the Don King of the gladiator biz a street-smart promoter who sees in the warrior Maximus a ticket out of the boonies and on to the big time. Yep the Coliseum itself. From there of course its pretty much a headlong rush into The Fight Club 180 AD. We may not have seen the drill in a while but its still reassuringly familiar. So bring it on all that ""We who are about to die salute you"" jive -- the glistening steel hacking and stabbing the uncaged beasts prowling and snarling the horse-drawn chariots racing and toppling the computer-generated mob hooting and hollering punctuated by that imperial digit held at a suspenseful horizontal and poised to deliver the final judgment. Oh its enough to bring an excited blush to the chubby cheeks of the greatest Roman of them all. Whats your verdict Augustus Ebert -- thumbs up or thumbs down? Please let it be up at least part-way up. Give credit to the casting of Russell Crowe whose principal roles -- in L.A. Confidential and The Insider and now this -- testify to a versatile talent. Here donning a pure heros mantle that leaves precious little room for character development Crowe gets by on sheer physical presence on a flinty-eyed capacity for noble suffering and on speaking softly while carrying a big broadsword (a quiet titan Maximus qualifies as Maxi-mum). Also unlike his fellow Aussie Mel Gibson hes capable of doing the braveheart bit without feeling the occasional need to offer the audience an ironic nudge-and-wink. Unfortunately his love interest looks slightly pale in this outing. Seems Maximus once had a thing for Commoduss fetching sister (Connie Nielsen) but the backstory remains vague and those amorous ashes stay unstoked. Similarly disappointing is the villain of the piece. Obviously the era allows for nastiness writ large giving actors a chance to crank up their performance to the level of delicious camp. But Phoenix takes a lower-case approach to Commodus who emerges as nothing more than a failed daddys boy and thumb-sucking wimp -- a wimp with clout to be sure yet hardly in the league of such heavyweight crazies as Caligula or Nero. Politically hes all circuses and no bread. But personally hes just a milquetoast and not exactly a formidable foe. Ridley Scott boasts an elastic career that stretches from the reputable to the ridiculous -- from Blade Runner Alien and Thelma amp; Louise all the way to G.I. Jane and 1492 Conquest of Paradise. This time he splits the difference charting a no-risk course down the middle of the road. Even the key gladiatorial sequences are a mixed blessing. Theyre shot in quick-cut and jagged close-ups a perspective that giveth and taketh away -- it sticks the bloody gore in your face but keeps the spectacle at a distance. In its defence the script is eager to let us draw parallels between these old Roman theatrics and the new Hollywood version periodically dropping in lines like ""Rome is the mob. Conjure a little magic for them and theyll be distracted."" Indeed what Proximo says to yesterdays gladiators is equally true of todays directors ""Win the crowd and you will win your freedom."" However the problem with so many directors is that theyve become self-enslaved voluntarily chained to safe convention. Gladiator definitely ""conjures a little magic"" and given our fondness for an absent genre plus our eagerness for any distraction a little could be sufficient. Yes Scott may well win the crowd but his freedom seems a lost cause.

Grand visuals great cast RELATED SITES By Reviewer Paul Clinton (CNN) -- ""Gladiator"" is spectacular and so is Russell Crowe in the leading role of Maximus a Roman general who is kidnapped sold into slavery and then tries to hack his way back to freedom as a gladiator. Set in the year 180 AD when the Roman Empire was at the peak of its power this stunning film by Ridley Scott is breathtaking both in its cinematic scope and its visual details. Its not a perfect work. The script often defies logic. Who knows why the vaguely defined characters do anything? Scott also apparently feels that accurate geographical details are beside the point. HOMEWORK HELP Official Gladiator site DreamWorks SKG More Homework Help These omissions create annoying gaps in the plot but this 107 million film is not meant to engage you intellectually. No this visceral sandal-and-toga epic was created to grab you by the throat and never let go plot be damned. It does too. Unleash hell As the film opens Maximus is leading his army against the last of the Germanic tribes opposing Roman rule. He is weary of war. His every movement shows it. But there is one more battle to be fought. Crowe fills the screen with his meaty presence as he commands ""At my signal unleash hell."" Scott an action maven of the highest order is happy to oblige. The battle scenes throughout the film are staggering in their realism. Scotts use of quick camera action extreme close-ups and high-speed edits plunge you into the bloody madness. This director loves to create whole new worlds in his films -- ""Alien"" in 1979 and ""Blade Runner"" in 1982 for example -- and hes done it again with ""Gladiator."" You can almost smell the sweat blood and fear as the battle rages. You meet some of the main players after the smoke clears. Richard Harris is perfection as the aging Caesar Marcus Aurelius. Hes at the end of his life and questioning his lust for conquest. Hes also concerned about the future of his people wanting to return Rome to its citizens with a Senate ruling instead of a dictator. Wisely deciding to bypass his greedy self-serving son Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix Marcus decides to appoint Maximus as protector of Rome until power can be transferred to the Senate. An unwilling leader Maximus who wants only to return to his farm wife and son reluctantly agrees. But before the plan can be put into action Marcus comes to an untimely end Commodus declares himself emperor and Maximus is sentenced to death along with his family. Though his hands are bound and hes outnumbered Maximus kills his would-be executioners and escapes. Our hero sets off to rescue his family but of course hes too late. Theyve been crucified. Now get ready to take a huge leap of faith. Without any transition Maximus is apparently kidnapped by slave traders right off his own doorstep. Its never made clear how. What does this say about the safety of your average Roman citizen let alone a general if every time your wife and son are executed -- and you take just a minute to grieve -- anybody can just come along and kidnap you into slavery? Heres the scene extreme close-up. Maximus is weeping (in a very manly way of course) at the spot where his family has been murdered. A foot comes into the frame. Cut to an African desert where Maximus now called ""the Spaniard"" is in a cage with fellow slaves. Thats how a leading citizen of Rome becomes someone elses property -- but never mind. Improbable plot points do little to slow this film juggernaut. Besides Maximus is now in gladiator training camp where there is much to learn. When in Rome... Cut to Rome. A smug petulant Commodus has seized power. Hes taken his sour grapes and turned them into one long whine. The only person to whom this tyrant will listen is his sister Lucilla played beautifully by Connie Nielsen. But Lucilla has her own agenda. Her young son is next in line for the throne and she knows her sniveling brother could destroy them in an instant. At one time she also had a thing going with Maximus and shes not pleased about his supposed execution. Commodus has no idea how to rule and the Senate is getting restless. So are the people but Commodus has a plan. Knowing that blood and guts go a long way toward keeping the publics attention he reinstitutes gladiator fights which his father had outlawed. The games filled with gladiators lions and tigers and bears resume. This is good news back in the provinces where Maximus new owner Proximo performed by Oliver Reed is training his boys for the big time. The biggest ring of course is the Colosseum in Rome. At first Maximus cares nothing about being a gladiator. Hes despondent -- a general without an army country or family -- but rallies when he realizes that he can gain his freedom with his sword. He now has two goals to fight his way to Rome and seek revenge against Commodus. Grand visuals great cast Apparently this was one of those films that was written as it was shot and it shows. Logic is an unintended victim a number of times in the film. But ""Gladiator"" gets its impressive punch from special effects and the films amazing overall look. This cinematic Rome obviously was not built in a day; Arthur Maxs sets and the visual effects created by John Nelson and Neil Corbould give it a authentic look. The recreation of the Colosseum is truly a work of art too. Acting is the films other strength. With the exception of Phoenix who plays his character at a single sustained hysterical note the cast is perfect. British character actor Derek Jacobi brings great dignity to his role as Senator Gracchus and Harris is terrific as the aging emperor. Nielsens role was a difficult one; she had to make the audience believe her changing allegiances and she succeeds. This sadly was the last film for Reed who died near the end of production. But most of his scenes as Proximo had been shot and his death didnt affect the films outcome. Happily this veteran of more than 100 movies goes out with a winning performance. He brings a much-needed humanity and depth of character to the film. But everyone else can step aside for Crowe. ""Gladiator"" should make the Oscar-nominated actor (""The Insider"" 1999) an international star. When hes in a frame he holds your attention like a vise. In a word hes magnetic. From the beginning gladiator fighting was highly visual entertainment with lots of blood and action -- a spectacle designed for the masses. The same is true of this film. ""Gladiator"" opens May 5 in theaters nationwide. Rated R. 154 minutes.

"Gladiator | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; gladiator ) Gladiator (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Gladiator is the kind of movie upon which Hollywood once built its reputation but rarely produces anymore the spectacle. Filled with larger-than-life characters gorgeous scenery impressive set design and epic storytelling Gladiator is designed not just to entertain but to enthrall. It draws audiences in and immerses them in a reality that is not their own. A boisterous reaction is expected every time the protagonist defies the odds and wins a conflict or changes the tide of battle in his favor. This is filmmaking on a grand scale. Director Ridley Scott made his name in movies by helming two acknowledged science fiction classics Alien and Blade Runner. Aside from those films however his resume is littered with mediocre and unpromising titles such as his most recent outing G.I. Jane. (Some argue that Scott returned to form with 1991s overrated Thelma and Louise but thats not an opinion I share.) Gladiator represents the British-born filmmakers second attempt at an historical epic and is far more successful than his previous endeavor the stultifying 1492 Conquest of Paradise which recounted Christopher Columbus arrival in the New World. Gladiator is set in 180 AD and uses actual historical personages and events for background. The events that transpire in the film are largely fictional but they blend in well with the known facts. The Roman Empire is in full blossom having survived the excesses of one corrupt emperor after the next. The latest Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is a scholar who has taken to the battlefield to repel a barbarian threat from Germania. To that end he has invaded relying upon the leadership and valor of his best general Maximus (Russell Crowe) to win the day. Maximus does not disappoint and the Emperor privately decides to name him a his successor - a decision that does not sit well with Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) Marcus son. In a fit of rage and grief he kills his father then has Maximus taken away to be executed. The general however escapes death slaying his would-be killers then races home to protect his wife and son. But he is too late - by the time he arrives they are both dead and he is soon taken prisoner by slave-traders. Along with his new friend Juba (Djimon Hounsou) he is bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed) an owner and trainer of Gladiators. Recognizing Maximus potential Proximo grooms him for a trip to Romes Coliseum. Gladiator weds the heroic scope of movies like Ben-Hur Spartacus Braveheart and Rob Roy with the serpentine political treachery of I Claudius. (A connection that is italicized by the presence of Claudius lead Derek Jacobi in the supporting role of a Roman Senator.) The film never fails to be involving and entertaining and there are plenty of moments designed to stir the adrenaline. Additionally the screenplay manages to avoid the trap of predictability. The villains are at least as smart as the heroes and far more ruthless. For New Zealand-born Australian-bred actor Russell Crowe Gladiator represents an opportunity to expand his reputation which was heightened earlier this year by a Best Actor nomination for his portrayal of whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand in Michael Manns The Insider. This is Crowes first opportunity to carry a big-budget motion picture. The role of Maximus requires more presence than acting skill and Crowe proves equal to the task. From films as diverse as Proof Romper Stomper and The Insider we know he can act. Gladiator shows that he can dominate the screen with a cold stare a clenched jaw and a sure gait - attributes normally reserved for the likes of action mega-stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. The supporting cast is comprised primarily of European notables. The exception is Joaquin Phoenix whose Commodus is a conflicted-yet-detestable villain. Phoenix plays the character as a spoiled degenerate with effeminate mannerisms and huge appetites (historians mark the real Commodus as one of Romes worst emperors). Yet like a snake coiled and ready to strike he is both unpredictable and dangerous. Connie Nielsen (who was one of the astronauts in Mission to Mars) is Commodus sister who was once Maximus lover and whose 8-year old son is the current heir to Caesars throne. Veteran actors Richard Harris Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (in the final performance of a long career) all have significant screen time. And Djimon Hounsou whose breakout role was as the lead in Amistad plays Maximus brother-in-captivity. Perhaps Scotts greatest achievement with Gladiator is neither keeping the pacing of a 2 1/2 hour movie tight nor choreographing a spectacular battle scene but creating a second-century Rome that is entirely credible and stunning in its detail. Ancient Rome is one of the most romanticized civilizations in the history of humanity and rarely has it been brought to life with the grandeur of this film. The Coliseum for example has been resurrected to its full glory (largely through the use of digital technology). Gladiator consistently looks good although during some of the fights rapid cutting creates a sense of disorientation and confusion. One minor stumbling block for the film is an occasional tendency towards moments of pretension. One of Gladiators themes is that power comes through controlling the mob. Successful gladiators are those who not only sate the crowds desire for blood but do so in an entertaining fashion. From time-to-time a character will make a florid preachy speech about this (or some other issue). We get snippets of dialogue like ""The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate its the sand of the Coliseum."" (Delivered by Jacobi the line sounds positively Shakespearean.) Theres nothing wrong with injecting social commentary about the bestial nature of human beings into a movie like Gladiator - my argument is that it should be more subtle. But thats a minor quibble. Like many of the great Hollywood historical epics Gladiator is the story of the triumph of a heroic figure over seemingly-insurmountable odds. In this case he is a slave taking on the most powerful man in the world - the Emperor of Rome. The ending may be a unlikely (although from Commodus point-of-view it could be a shrewd move if handled properly) but it is as exhilarating and satisfying as the final confrontation between Liam Neeson and Tim Roth in Rob Roy. As spectacles go Gladiator has a great deal to recommend it. And while the film has the ingredients to win over most audiences it remains to be seen whether the marketing campaign and positive word-of-mouth will generate enough ticket sales for this cinematic combatant to remain strong when the field of early summer challengers becomes more difficult.

"`Glad Tidings - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.`Glad Tidings`Gladiator Is The Most Visually Spectacular Of Roman Empire EpicsMay 05 2000|By Michael Wilmington Tribune Movie Critic.`Gladiator"" at its best is a magnificent throwback to the epics of another day. Ridley Scotts adventure saga about the decline of the Roman Empire -- and the rise of the warrior-performers who fought to the death for its crowds entertainment -- is a movie of almost overwhelming visual grandeur and excitement a bloody Roman festival capable of leaving any susceptible audience breathless.Scott one of the great modern movie stylists hasnt made a movie this visually electrifying since his 1982 sci-fi noir classic ""Blade Runner"" which shares with ""Gladiator"" a similar bleak vision of a loner-hero battling his way though a corrupt menacing world. Here though the imagined terrain is historical. We are trapped not in the grim paranoid future of ""Blade Runner"" but in a turbulent past the Roman Empire which with all its gaudiness and corruption has continuously fascinated moviemakers from the first great spectacle movie Italys ""Cabiria"" (1914) right up through the 60s with Stanley Kubricks ""Spartacus"" and Federico Fellinis ""Satyricon.""Though the genre has been largely moribund since then ""Gladiator"" restores its luster; its definitely the most visually spectacular of all Roman Empire epics. With the moody highly physical Australian actor Russell Crowe starring as Maximus a Roman general who is enslaved and made a gladiator during the reign of mad emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) Scotts film alternates scenes of exhilarating beauty with stunning stomach-churning violence.The movie has a bizarre patchwork screenplay -- with real-life characters like Commodus and his father Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris) mingled with fictitious ones like Maximus -- and in some ways it isnt satisfying either dramatically or historically. But successful script or not this is a film that drenches you with spectacle gorges you on excitement.From its first scene a hair-raising battle sequence in which Maximus routs an army of barbarians in a Germanic wood shrouded in gray mists ""Gladiators"" images (often digitally enhanced to make them even more grandiloquent) grip and amaze. And they continue to amaze even as the story gets more melodramatic as Commodus begins a jealous vendetta against Maximus the man hed like to be.In the opening section Scott and his writers show Harris Marcus Aurelius -- whose famous ""Meditations"" are still read -- as a kind of King Arthur turned King Lear raging against the dying of the light. After deciding to name Maximus and not his own son Commodus as his successor Marcus foolishly informs demented Commodus of the plan. Commodus promptly strangles his dad orders Maximus executed (after Maximus refuses to swear allegiance to him) and forges ahead to seduce both Rome and his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) a scorching beauty who is of course in love with Maximus.Maximus escapes execution but he is too late to rescue his wife and children from Commodus slaughtering centurions. And after Maximus is captured by another group of soldiers who dont know his true identity he is made a gladiator taught by grizzled Proximo (the late Oliver Reed) how to simultaneously fight and please a crowd.So Maximus returns to Rome as one of Proximos gladiators nicknamed ""The Spaniard."" After winning massive popularity for his stylish brave coliseum kills (fighting alongside African fighting buddy Juba played by Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad"") he links up with Lucilla and the republican senator Gracchus (Shakespearean Derek Jacobi) both of whom want to thwart Commodus burgeoning mad dictatorship. And Commodus even when he recognizes Maximus is unable to have him killed because of the gladiators godlike popularity. Maximus as idolized as a Roman Muhammad Ali keeps fighting.The Roman Empire has been responsible for innumerable movie spectacles and some prodigies of waste like the near studio-busting ""Cleopatra"" (1963). Telling this wildly improbable story Scott and his colleagues employ their 100 million-plus budget with an imperial prodigality. But they get munificent results filling the screen with one jaw-dropping production triumph after another.Huge digitally enhanced views of the coliseum (made to look many times larger than it actually is) packed with roaring crowds haughty nobles and a simpering announcer (David Hemmings) stretch out with intimidating vastness and sweep above the combatants. The palatial Roman interiors reek of decadence and secret vice. The filmmakers keep working visual wonders while the cast all play their parts to the hilt. With all this and a near classic outsider-hero performance by Crowe its a movie capable of enthralling if not quite winning your heart.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesStep Into The 31st Oscar Contest ArenaMarch 2 2001Epic `Gladiator Battles Way To 12 NominationsFebruary 14 2001The Good The `Glad And The UglyMay 15 2000`Gladiator The Best Of Both WorldsMarch 26 2001Delirious and pretty deliciousJuly 16 2010Find More Stories AboutBlade RunnerTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-05-05/entertainment/0005050133_1_maximus-commodus-roman-empire-epics,200,gladiator15,gladiator,chicagotribune

A muscular and bloody combat picture a compelling revenge drama and a truly transporting trip back nearly 2000 years Ridley Scotts bold epic of imperial intrigue and heroism brings new luster and excitement to a tarnished and often derided genre that nonetheless provided at least one generation of moviegoers with some of its most cherished youthful memories. After an absence of 35 years the Roman Empire makes a thrilling return to the bigscreen in ""Gladiator."" A muscular and bloody combat picture a compelling revenge drama and a truly transporting trip back nearly 2000 years Ridley Scotts bold epic of imperial intrigue and heroism brings new luster and excitement to a tarnished and often derided genre that nonetheless provided at least one generation of moviegoers with some of its most cherished youthful memories. But risky as this undertaking was at a budget well north of 100 million the unfamiliarity of its trappings look likely to work in its favor with modern audiences who should flock to this exciting entertainment in large numbers. Overseas haul promises to be even bigger than the domestic take for a picture that will have the incidental effect of making Russell Crowe a major star. From roughly 1951 with ""Quo Vadis"" through the mid-60s the ancient historical/biblical/war spectacle represented one of the mainstays of world cinema. Revived on the widescreen as a way to lure audiences into theaters with something they couldnt see on TV these extravaganzas which ranged from Oscar winners such as ""Ben-Hur"" to so-called sword-and-sandals potboilers like ""Hercules"" and far worse were among the biggest commercial attractions of the period. But the costly and overlong ""Cleopatra"" and ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" hastened the genres demise. The last of the full-blown old-fashioned imperial epics ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" a vastly underrated end-of-the-cycle flop in 1964 that remains stupendous in many respects provides ""Gladiator"" with its historical point of departure four of its principal characters and numerous plot points Both films first acts are set in 180 A.D. in the forests of Germania where the army of Marcus Aurelius finally subdues the barbarian hordes but where the aging emperor is eliminated by his treacherous son Commodus; they also place in opposition Commodus and a great general who was the late emperors favorite with Commodus beautiful sister torn between them. The stories subsequently move to Rome and conclude with mano a mano combat between the two mortal enemies. In treatment look and feel however there is a world of difference between the two movies; although shot through with an intelligence rare for the genre Anthony Manns film was stately formal and for its detractors slow while Scotts is vital visceral and pulse-quickening. And at its center is a great hero a ""real man"" who will inspire both male and female viewers a fellow of few words who speaks plainly and can handle himself in any situation especially physically. Jagged and impressionistic in a way clearly influenced by ""Saving Private Ryan"" 10-minute opening battle is a savage spectacle as General Maximus (Crowe) commands his troops to ""unleash hell"" on their overmatched adversaries with a deluge of arrows and flaming canisters that set the barbarians protective woods on fire.But as external conflicts are put to rest internal trouble is only beginning. The arrogant and unbalanced Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arrives at the front along with his beautiful older sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) just in time to learn that his ailing father (Richard Harris) has named the triumphant Maximus his successor as emperor. For his part Maximus a Spaniard who has never seen Rome and far more important has been separated from his wife and son for nearly three years wants no part of this plan.But Maximus makes the mistake of spurning Commodus. After killing his father in a fit of jealous spite the insecure new emperor orders the execution of the popular general. The resourceful Maximus escapes this fate but reaches home too late; when he arrives he finds his wife and son dead his farm torched. In the poetic manner of Sergio Leone Scott uses a man of actions bitter and idealized memory of his lost family as a motif and a motive for the single-minded pursuit to which he devotes the remainder of his life. At the 45-minute mark action shifts to a distant North African outpost of the empire where the captive Maximus is taken as slave. Purchased by gladiatorial entrepreneur Proximo (Oliver Reed) Maximus conceals his true identity but when thrown into the arena for the first time he fights well as a team with the African Juba (Djimon Hounsou) who will become his closest confidant. After returning to a Rome that looks as much like Hitler and Albert Speers plan for Berlin as it does the Forum as it really ever looked the new emperor orders 150 days worth of games at the Colosseum in an attempt to win the favor of the people. Bringing Maximus and other top fighters to Rome Proximo an old gladiator himself advises his new stars to ""win the crowd.""The gladiators entrance into the Colosseum has inspired Scotts most staggering visual coup; after their detention in dark confusing bowels of the great stadium they are suddenly rushed up and out into blinding sunlight before thousands of crazed spectators waiting to see their blood flow. Drawing upon his army expertise Maximus makes sure this doesnt happen turning the tables on the intended victors of the entertainment (a ""re-creation"" of the second war of Carthage) and earning the immediate attention of the emperor as a result. Commodus is aghast to learn that the man whose death he ordered is still alive and alarmed that this slave is suddenly more acclaimed among the people than he is. Also inspired by Maximus is Lucilla his long-ago lover who dares to suggest a meeting with a rogue senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) who would dearly love to use Maximus popularity as a political weapon against Commodus. Convinced by Lucillas desire to rid the empire of her neurotic brother Maximus joins the dangerous plot agreeing to an escape after which he will lead a waiting army into Rome against Commodus and help restore a republic. In the meantime of course Maximus must survive arena combat that is heavily rigged against him. The gladiatorial contests are tense dynamic and brutal to be sure and probably no less or more violent than most viewers would want them to be. Less fetishistic about the weaponry and modes of fighting than ""Spartacus"" and some other Roman combat pictures of yore ""Gladiator"" with its fast flurries of action and jump cuts emphasizes the ferocious speed and urgency of every move in the arena to the slight detriment of spatial unity and action continuity; in terms of the classical building of tension in a one-on-one fight the standard is still the Anthony Quinn-Jack Palance battle in Richard Fleischers ""Barabbas."" But ""Gladiator"" enjoys a solid foundation in the strength of Maximus the vividness of its evocation of the Roman world and the integrity of the story arc. Script by David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson shrewdly appropriates touchstone moments from previous epics just as it also cuts down the talk to a minimum when possible; there is none of the windy speechifying that ground many an epic to a halt in decades past. The action is presented in strictly Roman terms with none of the Judeo-Christian angle so common to the genre in the 50s. The film revels in both the glory and the horror that were Rome. Proximos luminous description of the Colosseum to Maximus beautifully conjures an image of what was then the center of the universe and the games themselves are presented in context as gaudy lowbrow entertainment. Countless details in Arthur Maxs brilliant production design and Janty Yates highly diversified costume design are offered up in wonderfully offhand fashion. Crowe is simply splendid every inch the warrior with his image of a tranquil domestic life an emblazoned but irretrievable memory. Phoenix makes for a more neurotic internalized Commodus than the gleeful maniac created by Christopher Plummer in ""Roman Empire"" a coddled youngster literally in love (and lust) with his sister. As the latter Nielsen has a consummately regal beauty and bearing; when her father says ""If only you would have been born a man what a Caesar you would have made"" its instantly credible. Harris is excellent as the philosopher emperor (played by Alec Guinness in 1964) who rues having spent most of his career making war and supporting players Jacobi Hounsou and a corpulent David Hemmings as the clownishly bewigged emcee at the Colosseum make distinctly favorable impressions. But the scene stealer in his last role before his death on location is Reed who hadnt brought such relish to a performance in years and to whom the film is dedicated. Proximos excitement over being able to return to Rome brings out the old mans boyish delight in his profession which he insists is just ""entertainment"" and Reed clearly reveled in both the physicality and the modestly hammy opportunities the part presented. Pic reps a great sendoff for him and a fine way to be remembered. Production represented a gargantuan undertaking in four countries; even if the film is a big hit its unlikely that the genre will come back in any significant way due to the costs involved. CGI effects have allowed numerous sets notably the Colosseum to be enhanced in size and spectacle value; the stunts fights and battles are as forceful and realistic as anyone could want John Mathiesons widescreen cinematography is magnificent and the pacing across 21/2 hours is well modulated.

"USATODAY.com - Gladiator More spectacle than sport Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/13/2001 - Updated 0249 PM ET Gladiator More spectacle than sport By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Gladiator (out of four) Stars Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix Connie Nielsen Oliver Reed Director Ridley Scott Distributor DreamWorks Rating R for intense graphic combat A lop here. A lop there. ""Off with their heads"" could practically be Gladiators slogan. There havent been so many decapitations on screen since the horrid B-picture 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag. But what director Ridley Scott should have been shouting instead during his bash-em slash-em effort to revive the long-dormant sword-and-sandal epic is ""Off with their shirts."" Whats the use of hiring a fabulous specimen like Russell Crowe getting him all sweaty and bruised as victorious general-turned-arena warrior Maximus then covering him up most of the time in a powder-blue shift or an ornate chest protector? Read more Related Complete Oscar coverage Trailer Gladiator Scott gave us Thelma amp; Louise and christened Sigourney Weaver the first truly feminist action hero in Alien. More than most male filmmakers he should know what women want from a Roman circus. And it isnt tiger attacks torso slicing or a lethal game of dodge the chariot. A healthy slab of beefcake will do it. Instead a chilling love triangle is the bone tossed to appease the female hordes (and perhaps a few male watchers). The threesome Crowe the military genius who is tapped to become the next emperor by aging ruler Richard Harris; an overripe Joaquin Phoenix Harris royal brat of a son who underhandedly seizes the throne; and the intoxicating Connie Nielsen who exudes the goddess aura of a 50s screen siren as Phoenixs sister who has a ""history"" with Crowe. No toga party is complete without a platter of decadence and Phoenix cavorts with his reluctant sib in a way that brothers and sisters can get away with only at the Oscars. Gladiator pays lip service to political corruption and family matters (Crowes son and wife are slain and Nielsens son also may fall victim to a jealous Phoenix) without wetting its whistle with either humor or camp. The late Oliver Reed is fine as the gladiator overseer a nod to the great Peter Ustinov in Spartacus but is never allowed to let er rip comically. Scott prefers to hide behind a shield of style and spectacle as the soundtrack thunders rattles and bellows along with the blood sport that splatters the screen. It all gallops by in a violent and vigorous blur. So what does Gladiator have that Spartacus or Ben-Hur didnt? Digitally manufactured aerial shots of ancient Rome. Now thats progress. About the only parallel to modern times is the rise of a vengeful Maximus as a Colosseum superjock complete with a stalking groupie who looks like Cher A.D. (After Divahood). As for Reed who advises Maximus to ""win the crowd and you will win your freedom"" he is like a studio chief who urges his filmmakers to pander to the lowest common denominator. ""Are you not entertained?"" inquires a disdainful Maximus of the roaring legions. Yes. And no. What earns a thumbs-up? The captivating (and decapitating) initial battle. Hundreds of fiery arrows soar like lethal lightning bugs across frigid German skies as downy snowflakes plop upon the slaughtered barbarians. Crowes hypnotic eyes husky growl and hulking presence -- although he still internalizes his torment much as in The Insider and keeps us at arms distance. The magnificently choreographed gladiator bouts like wrestling but for real although spoiled by the masked anonymity of most of Maximus opponents. What earns a thumbs-down? The acid-trip-inspired fever fantasies about Maximus family and home. The way actors like the venerable Derek Jacobi and the nice-to-see-again Djimon Hounsou (Amistad) are severely underused. How the movie promises a final skirmish the equal of its opening salvo yet opts for a one-on-one match that is a letdown if not a downer. The biggest disappointment is that even though Gladiator pours on the usual Caesar dressing it skimps on the heart-stirring spirit-lifting emotions of its predecessors. Instead of the heat of humanity what lingers on in the mind is the cool of the computerized effects.

These days the machinery of spectacle has gotten so sophisticated and so stunt-driven that emotional depth only slows a guy down. (The apotheosis of hero-dude blankness Keanu Reeves Neo in The Matrix.) Yet its Steven Spielberg grand wizard of stunts and special effects who has most influentially steered contemporary notions of bravery back along older-fashioned routes. Grand and rousing Gladiator owes its shape and scope to the splashy historical ""sword-and-sandal movies"" of the 1950s and 60s legendary cinema circuses like Ben-Hur and Spartacus. But Maximus (Russell Crowe) the charismatic general who stands at the center of director Ridley Scotts giant arena is but for the breastplate shield and (when goaded into it) bloodthirsty fury a brother-in-attitude of Tom Hanks Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan. Theyre decent men forced by circumstance to perform extraordinary feats faithful husbands who just want to go home but who take up arms instead to fix a broken world. (Theyre also both attached to units out of DreamWorks Spielbergs global theater of operations.) Like Private Ryan Gladiator charges into heart-pounding battle just minutes into the first reel. Assembling his Roman legions for an assault on a barbarian horde Maximus the well-liked leader circulates easily among his troops. ""At my signal--unleash hell"" he orders whereupon Scott lets loose his own extraordinary assault. Its a bravura sequence of flaming arrows falling horses and mortal combat that doesnt copy Private Ryans famous opening tour de force of carnage so much as raise a banner in admiration. Its Scott the visual artist at his most deluxe. The victory pleases Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who loves Maximus more than he does his own weak yet treacherous son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) or Commodus shrewd comely sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). The dying emperor would like the Spanish-born Maximus to succeed him paving the way for Rome to once again become a republic but Commodus doesnt take the news well; for an indolent weasel hes remarkably resourceful about killing everyone Maximus loves. He nearly succeeds in having Maximus killed too. Wounded the general escapes but is then captured by slave traders sold into bondage and marked for certain death under the ownership of Proximo (Oliver Reed) a cynical supplier of gladiators for all occasions. Maximus incognito return to Rome to fight in the Colosseum (in front of the new emperor Commodus) his quick rise to fame as the towns winningest warrior and his big showdown with his old adversary fill the last act of Gladiator--as do a dazzling display of old-time Roman crowd scenes and stadium acts conjured with computerized magic that would have slayed old sandal-movie showmen like William Wyler and Cecil B. DeMille. But as much as the directors mise-en-scene dazzles this is the rare Ridley Scott production in which individual characters have relatively secure separate identities. Certainly those incorrigible old thespians Harris and Reed play the bejaysus out of their character roles; theres also a deliciously creepy perversity elegantly mustered by Phoenix. (His Commodus is entirely too enamored of his sister but then again as happens in such muscle-bound extravaganzas Lucilla appears to be the only woman residing in all of the Eternal City.) And its a sly pleasure to see Derek Jacobi tied in a toga again as the empires most reputable senator some two decades after the actor starred on public television in the definitive Roman historical saga I Claudius. Gladiator though is Crowes to win or lose--Caesars thumb up or thumb down as it were. And he wins colossally. The New Zealand-born Australian-raised actors performances have each been so completely different from one another his transformation so complete and self-abnegating as to erase the notion of a fundamental Russell Crowe. Previously this disarming lack of a portable consistent publicity-friendly acting personality has gotten in the way of his becoming a marquee star. Not any more. The puffy ashen whistle-blower Crowe played in The Insider (for which he jolly well deserved the Oscar) has vanished replaced by a brawny army general used to working the land. This Maximus with his lovely meaty 1950s body mass like that of a William Holden or Robert Mitchum has a farmers vanity-free self-confidence; he needs to hold and smell a handful of the earth before each battle. Heartily masculine commanding yet capable of temperance and with a warily wearily understanding gaze Crowe makes Maximus desire to go home when his job is done the greatest aspiration a man can have. Whether or not he gets there in the end doesnt matter. What matters for todays hero is the good fight and Gladiator KOs us with a doozy.

Directed by Ridley Scott from a script by David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson. 150 minutes. Several theaters. ""R"" - restricted for graphic gladiatorial violence. --------------------------- Theres a thrilling sense of transcendence that wont let go from the first masterfully constructed frames in Ridley Scotts modern epic of ancient Rome. Its that very rare feeling that youre settling into a movie whose individual elements are so finely attuned they fuse into a singular construct of pure entertainment. Bristling with intense action sequences loaded with star power and buttressed by a formidable cast that brings appropriate gravity to an absorbing script this tale of power and revenge proves that there are still some people in the movie business who know what theyre doing. Leading the long line of creative talent is Russell Crowe as Maximus a ferocious yet humble general in Marcus Aurelius Roman Army circa A.D. 180. After a years-long campaign in the farthest reaches of the empire hes finally on the verge of victory. The battle sequence that opens the film sets a rousing standard for all that follows in its lyrical brutality and razor-sharp pacing. The dying Aurelius (Richard Harris) implores Maximus to be his successor as Caesar. He believes Maximus can restore Rome to a republic saving it from the corrupt tyranny that would surely be maintained if his ignoble son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) were to rule as emperor. But Maximus just wants to go home to his wife son and olive farm and his uncertainty allows Commodus to exploit the treachery Aurelius feared. Betrayed and banished Maximus world crashes around him. He loses all that he cared for and finds himself captive as a slave. Proximo (Oliver Reed) a wily human trader acquires Maximus in a North African market and steers him on a new career as gladiator. An instant sensation for his proficiency in the ring Maximus makes his way to Rome where thousands cheer him on in the elaborate carnage of the Colosseum. There Maximus ultimately exacts the revenge that has driven his heros journey. ""Gladiators"" literary narrative is perfectly balanced by the strength of its visual style. Whether in squalid pits under the Colosseum or the blazing sun of its magnificently re-created battleground the burnished light gives every composition a dazzling painterly quality. Computer-enhanced shots of the Roman landscape are full of detail from the statuary and columns of the Forum to the retractable velarium over the freshly minted Colosseum. Ditto the interior sets where bedchambers and imperial throne rooms sparkle with authenticity. It is the ensemble cast that brings life to the special effects and the art direction. Joaquin Phoenix has been waiting for a role that echoes his off-center disposition. As the corrupt young Caesar he strikes a clever balance of noblesse and puerile arrogance. You may notice a disruptive flash in the few abrupt cuts and high-tech wizardry used to posthumously complete Oliver Reeds final scene (he died during production). But the late actors memory couldnt be better served by his turn as the cruelly honorable Proximo. The biggest winner in the ""Gladiator"" experience - after the audience - is Russell Crowe who finally takes his place as a bona fide movie star. Exuding authority as a mans man able to stare down any situation and come out on top Crowe has the steely power to make both men and women quiver at his virility. Its not just sex appeal. Crowe fills the screen with the larger-than-life presence of a mythical hero. Four decades after ""Ben-Hur"" ""Spartacus"" and ""Cleopatra"" set the standard for ancient spectacle its exhilarating to experience the glint of clanging swords and gilded chariots in an idealized Roman landscape. ""Gladiator"" invents that spectacle anew in a mammoth production that resonates from its deeply intimate core. Copyright (c) 2000 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

PARKS Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Published 530 am Friday May 5 2000 Wrapped around the scenes of savage blood-letting both in war and in the fabled Roman Colosseum director Ridley Scott delivers one of the most entertaining sword-and-sandals epics ever put on film. Surprisingly the movie is intelligent. Comparisons to Spartacus and The Fall of the Roman Empire are overzealous but Gladiator does have enough going on both inside and outside the heads of the protagonists to keep us thinking and feeling. Call it Spartacus-lite which isnt meant to be deprecating. The film suffers an unlikely fantasy ending that borders on silly but its sincerely played and filmed with a touch of bittersweet to bring us back to reality. Sinews rippling and facial muscles writhing in anger and pain Russell Crowe (The Insider) delivers a rousing empathetic commanding performance that could finally make him the star he should be. As Maximus favored and loyal general of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) Crowe becomes a perfect mans man hero respected and loved by his troops because he rides in the fore as they charge into battle -- the film opens with an awesomely realized battle against a barbarian horde in ancient Germania -- and he slays more than his share. The aging emperor adores Maximus who loyally serves for the democratic concepts of Rome that the emperor himself pragmatically pushed aside. The emperor plans to pass leadership to Maximus thus bypassing his own petty self-indulgent son Commodus played with satisfying complexity by the excellent Joaquin Phoenix. Its an honor Maximus declines. After years of war he longs for his distant family. But treachery makes his decision moot. Commodus slays the emperor and Maximus ends up a gladiator slave seeking to avenge those he loves. Even in slavery and exile Maximus plots a path to revenge that will take him to glory and a confrontation with his enemies. And what a thrilling tale his quest becomes set against a fabulously re-created Roman empire. The movie was filmed in the English countryside London Morocco and Malta. Seemingly all of bustling Rome was computer-graphic imaging including the Roman Colosseum. There are shots of the city and surrounding hills that take us back 2000 years. Forget about a cast of thousands. Make that hundreds of thousands thanks to computers. There is a huge scene of Commodus entering Rome that rivals the scene of Hitlers arrival at Nuremberg in Triumph of the Will for sheer magnificence and excessive militaristic opulence. The detailed sets props rich costuming and barbaric rags are all spectacular. Gladiator is a sure Oscar contender in many technical categories. The most magnificent artifact in the movie is the storied Roman Colosseum. ""Can man really build such a thing?"" says one of the slaves when brought to the Colosseum. Its a convincing and fascinating illusion. A ""helicopter fly-over"" shot of the Colosseum crowds cheering and banners flying feels anachronistic but is thrilling to see nonetheless. The film contains one large battle scene and at least three major arena fights. While the camera eye does not linger long on each intense act of violence theres plenty of gore shown in abrupt edits. For those with no interest in watching gladiators hewn from stem to stern the movie has other diversions. Commodus sister the smart and stunning Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) longs for Maximus whom she loved many years ago. Now Lucilla has a son to protect and its uncertain how that will play into her wavering decision to support Maximus who has rejected her attentions several times or brother Commodus who has an unhealthy attraction to her. Derek Jacobi plays a Roman senator willing to side with gladiator Maximus if it will make Rome a true republic. Djimon Hounsou (Amistad) plays an African warrior eager to return to his own family and ready to follow Maximus to death or freedom. Oliver Reed in his last role portrays a gladiator owner torn between his own greed and his respect for brave men. Reed died during production (while drinking in a Malta bar) and the production rewrote his last scene and completed it digitally at a reported cost of 3 million. The faked scene is near the end of the movie if you want to try to spot the trickery. Good luck. Scotts work is almost always intelligent slick and highly professional (Blade Runner Thelma amp; Louise G.I. Jane) but this will certainly raise his reputation and salary. Theres nary a dull moment in the film which seems far shorter than its 2 1/2 hours. This is Crowes film however. It is not as subtle or toned a performance as his role in The Insider but it brings Maximus to life and gives us a plausible hero to cheer for.

Starring Russell Crowe Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen. Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Forty years ago the biggest and most expensive movies were set in ancient times. Sweaty gladiators and armor-clad warriors of the Roman Empire were familiar movie characters while any roly-poly actor with a British accent could bank on steady employment playing Herod Herod Jr. Nero or a toga-wearing senator. Today its accomplishment enough that the sight of Russell Crowe in a battle tunic isnt funny. But ""Gladiator"" which opens today does more than get away with it. This Ridley Scott film his best in years re-envisions ancient Rome for the aughts and makes it safe to go back in the Colosseum. The visual conception of ""Gladiator"" breaks with the past. The film has neither the saturated tone of Technicolor nor the bleached-out sterility often used in the depiction of ancient Rome. The world of ""Gladiator"" is sandy and gritty rendered in earth tones and presented with the violence and velocity of a modern action film. In place of the earnestness and dignity of the earlier epics qualities that leave them open to parody ""Gladiator"" has irony and pessimism. In fact there is only one thing about it that can be called genuinely silly the name of the lead character Maximus which sounds like a brand of prophylactic. Fortunately if there is anybody self-possessed enough to get away with having a name that sounds like a condom its Crowe. Advance publicity has suggested that this film will make Crowe a major star. It just might. Watching him here its clear that Crowe has that thing Gable had and Sean Connery has -- that assured undiluted 100 percent guy-ness that makes any man standing next to him look by comparison like Quentin Crisp in lounging pajamas. Crowe plays a weary lumpy- faced Roman general who starts off the film by annihilating a tribe of barbarians the last hairy obstacles between Rome and world domination. Now all he wants to do is go home to his wife and child but the ailing Emperor Marcus Aurelius has another plan. He wants to bequeath his kingdom not to his son and heir but to Maximus. KINGLY PRESENCE Richard Harris performance as the emperor is one of several turns by heavyweight actors whose work is nicely absorbed into the flow of ""Gladiator"" with no fuss. Harris doesnt flash his characteristic magnificence but owns and contains it in a way that seems genuinely kingly. Likewise the performances by the late Oliver Reed as a former gladiator and Derek Jacobi as an effete but courageous senator have a certain -- not understatement which is no virtue -- but proportion. When the Emperor dies before he can announce the succession his son Commodus (sounds like a toilet; whats the deal here?) takes over and Maximus life becomes a living hell. He escapes a death sentence and ends up a gladiator in the provinces. What that means more or less is that he kills everybody he meets in the provinces. Its just one way of seeing the world. ""Gladiator"" is at least in part a movie about a man seeking revenge which means a fair amount of its success must be ascribed to Joaquin Phoenix who makes Commodus a frightening and contemptible character. Commodus is not the typical Roman decadent. Phoenix plays him more as an amoral insecure young man driven to near madness by total power and the inherent loneliness that attends it. MOMENTUM BUILDS At 2 1/2 hours ""Gladiator"" is a long ride but it doesnt drag. The story keeps pushing forward with lots of action and intrigue. Connie Nielsen as Commodus pragmatic sister Lucilla does well in the films most repressed role As her brothers companion she can rarely speak her mind. We know of her growing alarm only by what she shows and tries to conceal not by what she tells. Throughout Scott never ceases giving us interesting things to look at. For one thing theres Rome As seen for the first time by the gladiators it looks as glittering and assaultive as Times Square might look to the salt men of Tibet. This may be the first Roman epic ever where the audience is made to understand the sensory impact of just entering the arena. Even before the tigers leap out from the trapdoors these gladiators are finished. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence. ..

Action Passion - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Ridley Scott Action PassionMOVIES - Movie reviewAt Home In Rome Ridley Scott Has Endowed His `Gladiator With Emotional RichnessMay 5 2000|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticMilitary man turned popular fighter turned political figure.No this is not The Jesse Ventura Story. The movie in question is Gladiator Hollywoods much-trumpeted return to the Roman Empire epics that flourished in the days of Ben-Hur (1959) and Spartacus (1960).To most of todays movie audience those days must seem almost as remote as the days of ancient Rome itself. And yet Gladiator is likely to fill up even the biggest Colosseum-sized cineplexes.Action-packed and passionate the new film deals in broad strokes and flashy theatrics. But its melodramatic narrative has a surprising emotional richness. And its larger-than-life figures are never so large that they stop seeming human.Maximus (Russell Crowe) the title character starts off as Romes greatest general popular with his men and also with Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).After leading his forces in one final triumph Maximus receives a pivotal proposition from the emperor. Taking Maximus aside Marcus Aurelius reveals that he hopes to turn Rome into a republic with the general as its leader.The plan however does not sit well with the emperors fiendish son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) who immediately takes matters into his own greedy hands.Before Maximus knows what has hit him our hero learns that Marcus Aurelius is dead and that Commodus having proclaimed himself the new emperor has the same fate in mind for the general.Barely escaping with his life Maximus is soon taken prisoner and turned into a gladiator - a slave known only as the Spaniard who must fight for his life in Romes great Colosseum.Ridley Scott who directed this impressive production is a hit-and-miss sort of filmmaker whose work has ranged from the depths of 1492 Conquest of Paradise and Legend (Tom Cruises worst movie) to the heights of such classics as Thelma amp; Louise and Alien.Scotts latest offering doesnt fly quite as high as his highest achievements but its definitely up there. Working from a script by David Franzoni (Amistad) John Logan (Any Given Sunday) and William Nicholson (Shadowlands) he recovers some of the glory and grandeur that were Roman epics.In many ways Gladiator isnt so different from a film like Conan the Barbarian or from the Mad Max movies The action including a certain amount of savage violence is part of the appeal.Gladiator offers a major dose of this early on when Maximus leads the Roman forces into battle against the barbarous hordes of Germania.``At my signal the general commands ``unleash hell. And as Scott films the battle the flaming arrows and blazing catapulted projectiles attain the percussive power of modern-day machine guns and smart bombs.Much later when the battlefield is the Colosseum Scotts camera captures the up-close-and-personal combat with its bloody swordplay and charging tigers.The sheer scale of the production is also impressive including the imposing views of the Colosseum and other points in Rome. This is the sort of movie that boasts a cast of what I suppose can only be called CGI-generated thousands.In Gladiator the stars have more actual acting to do than action-film stars often have.For Crowe the role of a Roman gladiator may seem a world away from his Oscar-nominated performance as a corporate whistle-blower in The Insider. But both parts require a lot of brooding and Crowe with his clouded eyes is a master of moodiness.Besides anyone who saw him in the Australian film Romper Stomper knows that he moves well.The supporting cast is full of distinguished older actors including Richard Harris whose brief wonderful performance as the weary Marcus Aurelius haunts the entire film and Derek Jacobi who pops up as a sympathetic if rather Olympian senator. In a spicy turn as Proximo - the trainer of the gladiators and a former slave himself - is Oliver Reed who died May 2 1999 and to whom the film is dedicated.Much of Gladiator involves the interplay of Maximus Commodus and Lucilla the sister of Commodus played by Connie Nielsen (Mission to Mars). Nielsen brings to her role a quiet dignity and an air of mystery You wonder about her hinted-at past love affair with Maximus and her current bizarre relationship with her brother.As Commodus Joaquin Phoenix (Return to Paradise) just about walks off with the movie.Perverse and wounded sympathetic and despicable Phoenixs marvelously complex performance encompasses opposites without confusing the issues As Commodus hes a man for all inclement seasons.With a little more work on the story Gladiator might have been a truly great movie instead of just a thoroughly entertaining one.The scenes that show how Maximus becomes a slave are far too sketchy. And theres a problem near the end when a character who is not known for his physical prowess decides to go mano a mano with Maximus. (The fight is rigged but still ... )But such lapses aside Gladiator is especially fascinating when it explores the relationship between power and popularity - and how a gladiator can challenge anyone even an emperor if the public is with him.``Win the crowd Proximo counsels Maximus ``and youll have your freedom.Theres a lesson here for filmmakers who as the summer wears on will be lining up to get the crowd on their side. At the head of the gaudy parade is Ridley Scott whose powerful new Gladiator ought to get a thumbs up from the crowd if not also from the critics.

No one has tried a revisionist take on the gnashing-teeth sweaty-torso clanging-steel epic since Arnold Schwarzenegger crushed all the consonants under his sandaled feet in ""Conan the Barbarian"" almost 20 years ago. The story of a proud Roman soldier who is sold into slavery and must fight his way back to freedom ""Gladiator"" suggests what would happen if someone made a movie of the imminent extreme-football league and shot it as if it were a Chanel commercial. In fact the movies director Ridley Scott filmed the perfume ad; he made most of Chanels more memorable spots. Mr. Scotts inhuman glossy style is fey and terse postcards from Mount Olympus. At least thats where ""Gladiator"" seems to take place  there or some other mythical area since the Roman Colosseum is roughly the size of the Death Star from ""Star Wars"" thanks to the magic of computer graphics. With each scene composed for an audiences delectation of the constant slaughter the movie is both pandering and detached. Its like a handsomely designed weapon you cant take your eyes off it even though you may be repelled by its purpose. The first battle when the hero Maximus leads his troops against Germania is full of Bruegelesque imagery. Flaming arrows fly through the sky resembling tracer shells from a World War II movie; a sword is left in the side of a tree steam issuing from the warm blood dripping from its blade. After the battle ashes drift from the sky like snowflakes. And that is all in the first 10 minutes. As Maximus a general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris who looks as if he went mano a mano with too many Bombay martinis) Mr. Crowe has the keen repressed rage of a man devoted to his flag or of a movie star who doesnt have the patience for stupidity. There have been numerous reports that the badly behaved Mr. Crowe turned the shooting of ""Gladiator"" into his own version of the Fall of the Roman Empire. But his temperament gives the picture a center Maximus looks as if he has a thousand things on his mind most of them unpleasant. Yet his work isnt all glower. Even though he hasnt smiled in a movie since the underrated ""Proof"" in the early 1990s Mr. Crowe is given to a hurt swallow when hes uncomfortable and to a look of suffering in his eyes. He is struggling to hold on to his dignity in the face of humiliation a trait that runs through characters in most of Mr. Scotts films from Harvey Keitels in ""The Duelists"" to Demi Moores in ""G.I. Jane."" Maximus is like a son to Aurelius a notion that doesnt make Aureliuss own son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) too happy. Commodus kills his father and orders a hit on Maximus. The soldiers sent to dispatch Maximus arent quite up to the job; he survives the murder attempt and ends up a slave under the thumb of Proximo (Oliver Reed) a former gladiator who sends his own men into the ring. Mr. Reed seems to find it delicious that he is mentor to a character he might have played himself a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. With a satisfied sleazy purr and red still dancing in his eyes from the last party he attended Mr. Reed still looks capable of malice; the movie misses out by not sticking a blade in his hand. (He died before filming ended.) Maximus is forced to fight to stay alive in the Colosseum while awaiting the chance to take his revenge on Commodus up close and personal. ""In this life or the next I will have my vengeance"" he snarls. Maximus confounds all expectations by becoming a star in the ring. When he upsets a historical battle re-creation Commodus muses ""My historys a little hazy but didnt the barbarians lose the battle of Carthage?"" In the bowels of the Colosseum where life is cheap Maximus turns the other gladiators into an army. As played by Mr. Phoenix Commodus is like a serious version of Dr. Evil coming on to his sister (Connie Nielsen) while she pines for Maximus in this brazen mix of blood sport and soap opera ""Rocky"" by Ross Hunter. Mel Gibson was said to have been the original choice for Maximus but Mr. Crowe  given extra nobility by a Caesar haircut  has a ball-of-fire rage he can barely contain similar to Mr. Gibson before stardom mellowed him. Mr. Crowes no-nonsense baritone even sounds faintly like Mr. Gibsons voice and both have the elongated vowels of an Australian trying on an American accent. Mr. Crowe sometimes has too much energy for a role. Hes not good at standing still; in ""The Insider"" trapped under the extra weight he put on for the role his active-mans discomfort in that suet became the performance. The battle scenes in ""Gladiator"" dont have the exultant lift of Hong Kong period-action pictures like the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" series where the fights have the eye-popping panache of dance sequences from a musical. Here theyre more like ""W.W.F. The Motion Picture"" complete with chest puffing and the hero challenging his boss to a duel. But in ""Gladiator"" Mr. Crowe does get to move and there arent too many English-speaking actors who get so much pleasure out of physical exertion. He treats a sword like Ginger Rogers twirling it masterfully and snatching it out of the air while on horseback  the kind of action flash inspired by Hong Kong movies. Much of ""Gladiator"" was inspired by other movies enough to make you wonder if its homage or if its actionable. Mr. Scotts infatuation with European decadence which led him to turn the Los Angeles of ""Blade Runner"" into a futuristic version of Weimar Republic Berlin is in abundance here. Soldiers move in formations out of Leni Riefenstahls ""Triumph of the Will."" The movie wants to criticize the crowds thirsting for violence yet it doesnt shy away from presenting gladiators wrestling with tigers. Commodus waxes dementedly that ""the power to amuse a mob is power."" Its the only kind of power ""Gladiator"" desires. In the movies first battle Maximus strides off to ""unleash hell"" and his loyal dog dives off after him. In the pitch of the fight the doggie disappears. Perhaps in an earlier version the pooch was killed and the filmmakers learned there are things movie audiences wont accept. Its the closest the film comes to integrity. ""Gladiator"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes decapitations exultant mutilations stabbings and the odd tiger assault.

"Into the Arena - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-David FranzoniMovie Review Into the ArenaRussell Crowes muscular performance stylish battle scenes and rich atmosphere help cut through the shortcomings of Ridley Scotts Gladiator.May 05 2000|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC ""Gladiator"" delivers when it counts--but then and only then. Like an aging athlete who knows how to husband strength and camouflage weaknesses it makes the most of what it does well and hopes you wont notice its limitations. With someone like Russell Crowe in the starring role it doesnt have much to worry about.An intensely masculine actor with the ability to be as thoroughly convincing in a tailored suit (""The Insider"") as in a suit of armor here Crowe has a patent on heroic plausibility. Whether its as commanding general Maximus adored by the armed multitudes or a friendless man fighting for his life in a ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"" plot Crowe brings essential physical and psychological reality to the role. Even Spartacus himself might want to echo Billy Crystals Oscar night wail of ""I am so not Spartacus"" after seeing what Crowe is up to here.If Crowe is well suited to be this films star the same can be said for Ridley Scott as its director. From ""The Duelists"" his 1977 debut through classics like ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" Scott has demonstrated a wonderful gift for ambience for making out-of-the-ordinary worlds come alive on screen.Initially inspired by a nifty 19th century painting of gladiators in combat by French artist Gero^me Scott and his production crew led by cinematographer John Mathieson and production designer Arthur Max have briskly re-created the Roman empire circa AD 180.""Gladiator"" is supremely atmospheric shrewdly mixing traditional Roman movie elements like neatly trimmed senators in carefully pressed togas and fighters who say ""We who are about to die salute you"" with the latest computer-generated wonders. Yes weve all seen the initials ""SPQR"" Maximus has tattooed on his arm but the Goodyear blimp-type shot floating over an SRO Coliseum is something invitingly new.The problem with ""Gladiator"" is that Scott is so good at creating alternate universes that he hates to leave and overstays his welcome. Too long at a full two and a half hours ""Gladiator"" is not as nimble outside the arena as inside.The film depletes its considerable resources and hampers its momentum by spending too much time on predictable plot twists and standard ""The mob is Rome who will control them?"" dialogue by the screenwriting tag team of David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson.""Gladiator"" opens with one of its best sequences a ""Saving Private Ryan""-type battle between the Roman legions led by Maximus and rowdy German tribes who to paraphrase Raymond Chandler picked the wrong empire to get tough with. Wrecking an area of Britain that had previously been scheduled for deforestation the struggle utilized 16000 flaming arrows and 10000 of the non-flaming variety not to mention fully functional catapults in a violent conflagration made a bit more palatable by the lightning editing of Pietro Scalia (who cut Oliver Stones ""JFK"").All Maximus wants after the fight is over is to go home to Spain and his wife and son but Marcus Aurelius the wise old owl of an emperor (Richard Harris one of the films detachment of British actors) has other plans. He wants to bypass his son Commodus and have Maximus succeed him at the top. ""Commodus is not a moral man"" the emperor says somberly. ""You are the son I should have had.""A single glimpse of Commodus played by Joaquin Phoenix and you know that the old man is being too kind. From his first frame the emperors son has the look of complete dementia combining ruthlessness ambition and lack of decency in one sniveling body. Not even his shrewd sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) who apparently had a ""do you think a princess and a guy like me"" romance with Maximus years earlier is a match for him in connivance.Before you can say ""We who are about to die"" etc. Maximus suffers through a complete life change. He ends up a slave chained to Juba (""Amistads"" Djimon Hounsou) and owned by Proximo a provincial trainer of gladiators. Energetically played by Oliver Reed in the last role of his life Proximo is a former gladiator himself who teaches Maximus the tricks of the trade and makes it possible for him to go to Rome and dream of revenge against the new emperor. Thats right its our old friend Commodus and hes more twisted than ever.Its in the backstage intrigue that surrounds the emperor and his court that ""Gladiator"" is at its least compelling. Too much time is spent on vacillating senators pro forma betrayals and over-familiar lines like ""The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate but the sand of the Coliseum."" Close your eyes and you can almost hear Victor Mature saying the same thing.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESYour Complete Oscar BallotMarch 25 2001The Roman Empire Rises AgainApril 23 2000MORE STORIES ABOUTDavid FranzoniSuitSpartacusCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/05/entertainment/ca-26670,200,gladiator26,gladiator,latimes

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News For all practical purposes Ridley Scotts reputation as one of the most important mainstream directors of his era rests on just two movies but what movies they are ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" didnt just imagine the future they helped create it. Grumpy critics like me often claim that style has become substance in Hollywood filmmaking and in Scotts case its all too true. For better or worse design is the point of his films; it is his narrative mode his central character and his subject matter. As my significant other suggested the other night now that Scott has lived to see the designers of midtown Manhattan self-consciously emulate ""Blade Runner"" perhaps the ancient world is all he has left to exploit.With the lone exception of ""Thelma and Louise"" which is atypical of his work in many ways Scotts post-1982 films have failed to capture filmgoers imaginations or to strike the sparks of cold genius that seemed so evident in his early visionary masterpieces. Yeah I know that ""Legend"" and ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" have their defenders (myself included) but thats not the point. As for ""1492 Conquest of Paradise"" ""White Squall"" and ""G.I. Jane"" well please. Were talking expensive candy -- really expensive candy -- with no chewy center.So the answer to your question about ""Gladiator"" is that the lights are blazing and the musics playing nice and loud but as far as I can tell nobodys home. Its re-creation of the Roman world from the gladiatorial games of the Colosseum to a hill town in North Africa to the barbarian front in Germania offers in equal parts computer graphics and old-fashioned moviemaking spectacle -- and is suitably impressive throughout. It even has a few sneaky moments of emotional power as when the general turned slave turned gladiator Maximus (Russell Crowe) dreams of meeting his family in the afterlife or in his stoical friendship with an African gladiator named Juba (Djimon Hounsou).But for all its grandeur ""Gladiator"" is a canned experience a film that flails around awkwardly trying to find a reason to exist or at least a compelling story to tell. (Those who claim to see it as an Allegory for Our Time are desperately reaching if you ask me.) Creating entertainment on an epic scale is not the same thing as creating an epic and ""Gladiator"" suggests an elaborate fancy-dress version of the video game Mortal Kombat. Sure it has plot elements -- a murdered emperor his wicked son and sultry daughter the heros longing for his dead wife and child -- but they mostly seem like exotic window dressing arranged around repetitious scenes of violence.In the words of film historian David Thomson Scott is a decorator a borrower and a synthesist who absorbs and reprocesses many different elements and influences. His borrowings here result in an undigested mash more redolent of his own youth in postwar England than of the second century Chop up the plots from various Hollywood sword-and-toga epics of the 1950s and mix in the conspiratorial atmosphere of ""I Claudius"" and some warmed-over Shakespearean acting. Add the beefy brooding Crowe for a hint of contemporary angst and stir in some World Wrestling Federation-level mayhem. Serve tepid.Crowes Jeffrey Wigand in ""The Insider"" was a man who could hardly begin to understand his own complexities; part of the appeal of that movie was watching the amazement with which he viewed his own courage and principle. Maximus is meant to be a man of simple tastes whose pain is all on the surface and its a credit to Crowe that the dullest and simplest character of his career still seems to have clouds and shadows swimming behind his eyes.The film begins with Maximus leading his legions to a glorious victory over the German barbarians in a stunningly successful mud n blood n arrows battle sequence. We learn that he was once in love with Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) witchy daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). But like the barbarian battle itself the Lucilla romance doesnt really go anywhere or mean anything; I think its there only as a plot device so Lucilla will have a reason to help the enslaved Maximus later in the film. You Might Also Like Out there on the grimly picturesque Germanic front with the steaming hordes facing his troops and the leonine Harris looking on in King Lear drag Crowe seems to be playing a loyal general in one of Shakespeares lesser history plays. This impression grows stronger with the arrival of the unfortunately named Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) the emperors preening languid-eyed son. He shows up too late for the battle but just in time to murder his father and stop him from passing control of the empire to Maximus who in any case only wants to go home to his Spanish farmstead. Phoenix is something of a scenery muncher at the best of times and perhaps he and Scott agreed that playing a decadent Roman usurper is no occasion for actorly restraint. Commodus spends much of the film bellowing or hissing like an asp and his queeny demeanor aside trying to slip between the sheets with his sister Lucilla.Maybe the plummy BBC accents adopted by Phoenix and the Danish-born Nielsen are intended to make them seem plausibly related to the Anglo-Irish Harris but the effect is somewhere between Monty Python and an ambitious college production of ""Antony and Cleopatra."" I dont know what Scott was thinking when he cast Derek Jacobi in a minor role (as a senator devoted to restoring the lost Roman republic). All it accomplishes is to remind us that ""I Claudius"" (for you youngsters the British TV miniseries in which Jacobi starred in the 70s) successfully achieved the kind of dense melodrama suggested by ""Gladiator"" but at a tiny fraction of the movies budget and with vastly superior writing.In the great tradition of improbable movie villainy Commodus doesnt have Maximus simply and efficiently killed but insists that several soldiers transport him miles away providing him ample opportunity to escape. Struggling home to Spain to find his farm burned and his wife and child grotesquely slaughtered Maximus somehow -- Im frankly not sure how and neither are the filmmakers -- winds up in the African gladiator training camp belonging to Proximo (Oliver Reed). A veteran of many cheesy costume dramas Reed seems to relish this slimy Mediterranean tycoon role. ""I did not spend good money on you for your company"" Proximo crows to his musclebound trainees. ""I spent it to profit from your deaths"" For a while at least ""Gladiator"" sheds its dour pretensions and slides toward the enjoyable-trash vein exemplified by Victor Mature in ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" or Steve Reeves in ""Hercules Unchained."" From here on out were talking Schwarzeneggerian dudes in fearsome masks and little skirts African charioteer babes in body-hugging armor ravenous tigers and cries of ""We who are about to die salute you"" Buoyed by his friendship with Juba Maximus defeats all comers in Africa and makes it to the big show in the Roman Colosseum where of course he gets many opportunities to humiliate the sinister but incompetent Commodus. (Phoenix never actually utters the phrase ""Thufferin thuccotash"" but his performance implies it.) You could argue that its a waste for an actor of Crowes caliber to play the kind of role customarily filled by retired bodybuilders but at least the grandiose fight sequences keep your mind off the torpid recycled plot.It may be that Scott and his screenwriters (David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson) think that the decadent Roman Empire depicted in ""Gladiator"" has some contemporary relevance. But such comparisons are inherently dimwitted; there has never been an age in human history that resisted vulgar spectacle and very few that didnt see themselves as in some way a decline from earlier eras. Sure the public will settle for bread and circuses most of the time but folks it was ever thus. The real story of compromise and decline here belongs to Ridley Scott who can find no better use for his ample talents than this grandiose but vacant entertainment. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

At times its surprisingly languorous for a modern actioner. But it also boasts some of the most exciting pre-gunpowder combat sequences ever Not only are the battles in ""Gladiator"" superior to - and more realistic than - anything in ""Braveheart"" theyre equal in excitement to the classic arena contests in ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus."" Theyre so gripping in fact that theyre disturbing Long before the final duel you find yourself cheering as wildly as the bloodthirsty Colosseum crowd. Directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien"" ""Blade Runner"") ""Gladiator"" also features breathtaking photography sets and computer-generated images. But the real glory of the movie is Russell Crowe who is simply magnificent as a mythical Roman general turned gladiator. Like James Mason he is one of those actors who can make the lamest line (and like its sword-and-sandal predecessors ""Gladiator"" has some clunkers) sound like Shakespeare. ""Gladiator"" opens on the empires wintry forested northern frontier with Maximus (Crowe) leading his legions against the ferocious German hordes. In a stunning battle sequence clearly influenced by ""Saving Private Ryan"" Maximus routs the last threat to Romes domination of Europe as the ailing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) looks on. The emperor offers him supreme power; Maximus says he would rather retire to his farm in Spain. But before he can make up his mind Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) the emperors son who is visiting the front with his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) murders Aurelius and assumes the purple. Commodus immediately arranges to have Maximus killed. The general escapes this fate but finds disaster at home before being captured by slave traders. Taken to North Africa Maximus is sold to the gladiatorial impresario Proximo (the late Oliver Reed as rascally and charming as ever in his final role). Initially reluctant to fight Maximus proves to be an extraordinarily deadly gladiator. Accordingly Proximo brings him to Rome to compete in games sponsored by the sports-mad Commodus. ""Gladiator"" draws heavily on its 60s ancestors but unlike them it contains no Christian message and more surprisingly no sex. Scott fills the movie with visual allusions to his own work as well as to ""Spartacus"" and even ""Apocalypse Now."" There are also some arty indulgences including Maximus bleached-out visions of his own death shots of speeded-up clouds scudding over the desert and black-and-white parade scenes that are clearly intended to evoke both Nazi-era Berlin and ""Triumph of the Will."" However there are no silly anachronisms - apart from an attempt to give the drama a modern political dimension. Periodically the characters spout historical absurdities about ""a dream that was Rome"" and ""giving power back to the people"" as if screenwriters David Franzoni John Logan and William Nicholson were recycling Princess Leias lines from ""Star Wars."" Ancient-history buffs might also quarrel with military details. The Romans didnt use artillery except in sieges for example and employed their swords for stabbing not slashing. Nor could they engage in cavalry charges because the stirrup hadnt yet made it to Europe. ---- GLADIATOR 1/2 Ridley Scotts revival of the sword-and-sandal epic is a spectacular triumph with sensational battle scenes and a terrific performance by Russell Crowe. First-class entertainment its marred only by slow sections occasionally leaden dialogue and some indulgently arty dream sequences. Running Time 150 minutes. Rated R.
