No I cant remember either. So unstoppable is the onward march of digital that it has even enticed that most traditional of animators Aardman the Bristol-based studio renowned for its instantly recognisable stop-motion animations (Wallace amp; Gromit Creature Comforts etc). Its a painstaking time-intensive technique but the final product has an appealingly organic homely quality to it. The studios latest film though eschews soft Plasticine models in favour of recreating its distinctive animation style with computers. Maybe its just as well that they (and mother studio DreamWorks) chose the easier CGI option because the resulting film is disappointingly below par.Suave pet rodent Roddy St James (voiced by Hugh Jackman) lives a luxurious lifestyle in his Kensington home. But when an obnoxious sewer rat emerges out of a water pipe Roddy - in Prince and the Pauper fashion - is maliciously dispensed to the sewers below. There he meets feisty punk-rat Rita (Kate Winslet) and together they unravel a dastardly plot by Ian McKellens nefarious Toad.Its a kids rat movie so youd expect some artistic licence to have been taken with the characters. However in the same way Aardman quirkified its Chicken Run cast by giving them teeth here its protagonists get human torsos and moppish hairstyles. Cute characters they aint. No question the animation is crisp rounded and model-like but the pacings lethargic the jokes - many of them movie-orientated and for a world market perhaps too British - are variable the action sequences mostly uninspired and the characterisations and voice-overs underwhelming.

A pampered pet mouse finds a new life in the sewers of Flushed Away. Photo DreamWorks Animation Flushed Away 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Im indebted to the makers of Flushed Away for two reasons. One crooning slugs. These adorable purveyors of ooze dole out sweet tight harmonies at every bend commenting on the plot like some limbless Greek chorus with especially bad skin. Until I saw them I didnt realize what was missing from my life. Two restraint. Im not sure how it happened but somehow the masterminds behind this giddy computer-animated tale about a mouse who gets flushed down the loo managed to pull it off with no poop jokes. When he first hits the sewage he bumps into a suspicious-looking brown log that proves to be a twig but after that nada. No scatological yuks whatsoever. And how cool is that? Actually a lot about the film is certified cool from its whirly animation to the hordes of crunchy pop songs on the soundtrack. A snazzy voice cast that includes Hugh Jackman as Roddy the upper-class flushee and Kate Winslet as Rita his proletarian co-star is also cool as are offhand references to Finding Nemo and The Da Vinci Code. I was cheered to find an albino henchman lurking in the sewer. I was thrilled to hear Bill Nighy voicing him. Flushed Away is the joint venture of two outfits DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features but its even more the hybrid of two far-flung comic traditions. Its neither as spangly American as Shrek nor as flaky-British as the Wallace amp; Gromit series whose tea-cozy quaintness and spoofy horror enlivened last years Curse of the Were-Rabbit. This one isnt quite as British or as brilliant. While the characters retain Aardmans signature box-lipped diction the switch from claymation to CGI saps much of their musty charm Everyones shiny slick not lumpen enough. But theyre less shiny less slick and lumpier than an all-Yank production might have rendered them. A Brit-savvy class awareness informs the plot which follows Roddy from his gilded cage in the posh Kensington neighborhood of London into an underground sewer-rat metropolis -- all tin cans and castoffs a whimsical art-assemblage made from trash. On his quest to get home he meets and antagonizes Rita who captains her own boat and the nefarious Toad (Ian McKellen depicted in a paisley smoking jacket) whos after a crown jewel in Ritas possession. Except its fake. And what hes really after -- his Master Plan bwa-ha-ha-ha -- is a length of cable that Rita wears as a belt. To retrieve it the Toad hires a band of criminal frogs led by a pencil-mustachioed ringleader named Le Frog. Le Frog is French and his gang includes a mime named Marcel. If all of this seems just a tad obvious it is rather sweet how often they want to break for meals. Also the ringleader sounds like Jean Reno because he is. Every time the movie skids into a backwash of soupy cliches something absolutely delightful whisks it back like Ritas mom mistaking Roddy for Tom Jones or those singing gastropods. ""High five"" yells one slug to another after a climactic moment of triumph. Then a downcast look no hands to slap. ""Oh"" he says dejectedly. ""Yeah."" Bitty bits like this give Flushed Away a dash of fun. A touch too frenetic a touch too pat marred by one too many groin injuries it nonetheless enchants with fleet animation and affably daffy humor.

Oh yes it declares there will be bathroom humor in this animated feature about a mouse who takes a wild porcelain ride to a cheery rat-infested world and learns whether hes a mans pet or a mouse. So parents ready yourselves and your tender young ones for the mildly scatological. Gird yourself for one too many gags made at a crotchs expense. But be prepared too for many a refined chuckle. From DreamWorks and Aardman the clever folks who envisioned the strange world of ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" this energetic treat does what animated features ought to. It plunges us into a world we could never inhabit without the aid of wisecracking animals inventive computer-graphics wizards and gifted writers among them ""Frasier"" smarty-pants Christopher Lloyd and Joe Keenan and ""Tracy Takes On ..."" scribes Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. Roddy St. James (the voice of the ever-busy Hugh Jackman) lives in a gilded cage in Londons gilded Kensington neighborhood. When his boy owner leaves he has the run of the swank digs. Super domesticated Roddy lives a pop- culturally aware existence amid other playthings. He takes a doll for a ride to catch the latest Bond out on DVD. He natters to all the inanimate objects as if theyre his dearest friends. Roddys life is marked by an emptiness he doesnt admit to but struggles against. Enter slovenly Sid (Shane Richie). A sewer rat expelled from the bowels of the apartments plumbing he plays the catalyst to Roddys reckoning. Roddy tries to get rid of Sid who has settled in for the World Cup on the telly. When push comes to shove Sid bests him. When he finally comes out the other end he finds himself in a world that resembles a Tokyo of neon clutter a Venice of toxically tinted canals and with all those rats a topsy-turvy Disneyland. And lets not pretend the studios competing animation groups arent winking and nudging each other with every new toon. On his way down miles of drainage pipe Roddy runs into a goldfish who asks ""Have you seen my father?"" Roddy finds himself in the middle of some roiling muck. The ""Great"" Toad (Ian Mc- Kellen) a great bore has dispatched two rats (figuratively and literally) to retrieve a ruby believed to have come from a Buckingham Palace drain. Rita (Kate Winslet) the finder of the gem hopes to keep it. The jewel turns out to be something of a ruby herring. What the toad really needs is a cable that will help him open the floodgates on the rats underground metropolis. The movie is flush with voice talent. As scavenger ship captain Rita Winslet anchors the whole affair with a tone that has verve and nerve. Andy Serkis and Bill Nighy amuse as the scrawny Spike and pink-eyed Whitey the rodents who do Toads lushly enunciated bidding. McKellen sounds to be having the time of his life playing proud wounded and evil. Dont wince but he and French actor Jean Reno as his cousin Le Frog give ribbiting turns. And who knew there was such a thing as a sewer slug? But underground they abound. Their little eyes sway above their sickly soft bodies. They spook at the drop of a hat ... er rat. So theres lots of mutual fright and simultaneous screaming. Their appearance as the occasional chorus isnt wholly original (remember the serenading mice in ""Babe""?) but they are a hoot just the same. The chatter is as zingy for the adults in the theater as the action is zippy for the kiddies. Those knowledgeable about the relationship between France and England might wonder for a moment if ""Flushed Away"" with its amphibious villains isnt a bit of a primer in xenophobia. When Le Frog is asked by a character if hes laughing at his pain his reply is priceless. ""I laugh at everyones pain but my own. I am French.""

(AP Photo/DreamWorks Animation) UNDATED HANDOUT PROVIDED BY DREAMWORKS ANIMATION. Photo Dreamworks Animation Rat heads straight for the sewer finds love 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Flushed Away Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Kate Winslet Hugh Jackman Ian McKellen and Jean Reno. (PG. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For a movie that takes place mostly in the bowels of a sewer ""Flushed Away"" has some surprisingly charming moments. Sir Ian McKellen is a perfect actor to voice the dastardly bullfrog theres a pack of slugs with excellent comic timing and even the maggots break into harmonious song. And despite the fact that they play cartoon rats Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet have more chemistry than George Clooney and Julia Roberts could muster in ""Oceans 11"" and ""Oceans 12"" combined. Made by some of the people responsible for ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" this computer-animated film could use a strong dose of Ritalin -- some of the action scenes are so frenetic that its hard to figure out whats going on. But its still far better than most childrens fare this year and the edgy humor will satisfy adult chaperones almost as much as the kids. ""Flushed Away"" features Jackman as a dapper pet rat named Roddy who lives a lonely life in his luxurious London bachelor pad -- think Hugh Grant in ""About a Boy."" He gets flushed down a toilet ends up in the sewer and finds a love interest in a rat named Rita (Winslet) and they fight a frog plan that could rid the city of rats forever. (In the movie this is considered a bad thing.) Rita and Roddy have a reverse Han Solo/Leia thing going with Jackman playing the uptight aristocrat needing help from Winslets roguish loner who captains a floating bucket of bolts that is more seaworthy than it looks. After several decades of watching a bunch of princesses who need saving its nice to find a movie with a positive female role model -- even if she is vermin. The plot is the worst part of the film which packs way too much action into the sparse 86-minute running time. But the short attention spans of directors David Bowers and Sam Fell are mostly forgivable because the movie is filled with so many entertaining characters. Jean Reno is particularly enjoyable as Le Frog playing an amphibious version of his mercenary assassin character in ""The Professional."" Produced by Aardman Studios and DreamWorks the characters have the same look as the stop-motion clay animals in ""Wallace amp; Gromit"" except this time theyre nowhere near as cool because the visuals are done with software. Aardmans biggest fans will be put off by the constant motion which may induce headaches for people who prefer ""TV Funhouse"" to ""Ice Age."" But at a time when it seems as if three out of four childrens films belong in a septic tank ""Flushed Away"" isnt a bad way to kill a couple of hours. -- Advisory For a movie that features overweight rats frogs and slugs who are quite literally living in a river of feces this film contains a shockingly limited amount of potty humor. (There is however some strong language a few gross scenes and comic violence.)

"Flushed Away struggles with comedic flow - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Flushed Away struggles with comedic flow By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 3 2006 Kids will probably be in stinky-sewage heaven with the new computer-animated critter comedy ""Flushed Away"" but even they may realize theyre up the proverbial creek in a boat with a faulty motor. Parents will while away the time in moderate boredom until the film unexpectedly springs to life in its midsection then just as abruptly goes back to sleep.The story line is ""Stuart Little"" meets ""Toy Story"" on the way to ""Madagascar"" -- what you were expecting originality? Hugh Jackman busy fellow voices the role of Roddy the pet rat pampered and lonely in his gilded London cage. After his human owners go on vacation the hero has to contend with Sid (Shane Richie) a party-hearty sewer rat who crashes the house and in short order flushes Roddy down the loo.Down below Roddy finds an entire bustling rat city one threatened by the corpulent villainous Toad (Ian McKellen) who plans to flood the burg by opening the sluiceways during halftime on World Cup Final day (when the entire population of England goes to the bathroom at once get it?).McKellen has a grand old time with his part as do the rest of the cast Bill Nighy as an albino rat henchman Andy ""Gollum"" Serkis as his slightly smarter partner Jean Reno as a French frog and -- most cheeringly -- Kate Winslet as a plucky rat adventuress named Rita.Jackman by contrast is stuck in a bland part and the movie never really takes off until the other characters build up a head of steam. At that point ""Flushed Away"" becomes genuinely funny for kids and adults alike and it sustains an air of congenial lunacy for a good half-hour until the plot rears its ugly head again.If it all feels a tad bipolar theres good reason. The film is the third final and most fraught collaboration between Aardman Studios the British-based animation house responsible for the ""Wallace and Gromit"" shorts and DreamWorks the Hollywood studio behind ""Shrek"" ""Shark Tale"" and ""Madagascar."" Aardman does goofy Claymation wit DreamWorks does shiny blockbuster computer-generated imagery and when the two collaborated on ""Chicken Run"" and ""Wallace and Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" the big behemoth generally let the little guys alone.Not so with ""Flushed Away."" Combining clay animation and watery sets proved an insoluble problem (or rather too soluble) and a 2005 fire at Aardman forced the production to go fully computer-animated with half the work being done by DreamWorks in the States. Attendant creative clashes were reported and the two companies have since parted ways.You can feel the tug-of-war in the back of the multiplex. The characters still have the lidless pop-eyes and funny teeth of Aardmans clay creations -- and no one knows how to make fun of the French better than the British -- but the slick CG is at odds with the companys patented handmade funkiness. For one thing the mouth movements feel jerky and incomplete. For another ""Flushed Away"" keeps getting pulled in the direction of formulaic big-budget crash-and-bang only to stop time and again for a spot of tea.Will your children care? No but listen to them when theyre talking about the movie on the way home. The parts they respond to -- the droll character humor or the frenetic action -- will decree which corporate parent will be taking custody of their pop-culture sensibilities. Divorce is a drag but its hardest of all on the kids.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME In a warehouse in Bristol England they have toiled away as their ancestors have done for a hundred years. Painstakingly perfectly they build little movie sets and fashion in Plasticine the creatures to live there. They take a photograph of the scene then move certain figures a micrometer then take another picture. They do this about a 100000 times to produce in four or five years a feature film like Chicken Run or Wallace amp; Gromit in the Curse of the Were-Rabbit. At Aardman Studios they make art by hand in a form called stop-motion animation whose history stretches back to the first days of cinema. It certainly goes back to the solitary youths of many Aardmanites. Nick Park the studios resident genius was one of those kids who played with clay in a corner of his Lancashire home until like Dr. Praetorius in Bride of Frankenstein he made those little figures come alive. All that meticulous drudgery pays off in a sparkling finished product. Park and Peter Lord and the hundreds of other genial obsessives over in Bristol have crafted some of the loveliest comic films since Chaplins. Creature Comforts Parks day at the zoo with talking animals and his short films with Wallace the cheese-loving suburban inventor and Gromit his mutely heroic dog can match any animated films of the past 20 years. But the process cannot be delightful. Most American animators would say its daft all that precision--toying with clay when these days computers can do so much of the work for you. That notion must have drifted over to Bristol. After two features and dozen of shorts whose wit and grace proved that stop-motion deserved to survive in the digital era some of the Aardmanites agreed to go to California and make a computer-generated feature with the companys American partner DreamWorks. (Not Park; he stayed home.) Could Aardman go to Hollywood without going Hollywood? The answer comes in Flushed Away supervised by Lord and directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell. Its an entertaining comedy that vibrates with two kinds of tension of antique artisans working in a new medium and of English artists collaborating and colliding with American showmanship. The movies reluctant hero Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is a pampered upper-class-English pet mouse. Kept in a literally gilded cage by a nice family in Kensington Roddy has impeccable manners and a chipper demeanor that cant quite mask his loneliness. So when hes flushed down a toilet into the London sewer system and discovers a complex underworld underground he is at first horrified then thrilled to join a plucky rodent named Rita (Kate Winslet) in her comrades battle against the pompous toad king (Ian McKellen). This Roddy realizes is the bustle and agitation hes been missing--the agita and ecstasy of life. Flushed Away wants to convince you that the threat of tadpoles plaguing London is somehow more horrifying than the actual pestilence of rats every large city suffers from. But its a fantasy--with attitude. Toad is if not a racist a species-ist; after some rats bungle an assignment he complains ""I should never have had rodents do an amphibians job."" It has fun at the expense of Germans and especially the French who are portrayed as cowardly and snobbish. (""You find my pain funny?"" asks Toad of a French creature called Le Frog voiced by Jean Reno. Le Frog replies ""I find everyones pain funny but my own. Im French."") Naturellement the movie is awash in rodent jokes from an amusing libel on the Pied Piper to the crucial moment when Roddy implores Rita to ""Nibble for your life"" Previous 1 2 Next Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

"Aardman Saves the Clay In Brilliant Flushed Away washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Aardman Saves the Clay In Brilliant Flushed Away The clay-animation studios computer-generated rodents have a handmade charm. (Dreamworks Animation) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 3 2006 The thumbprints may be invisible but theyre still there in spirit. Of the myriad joys to be had watching a film made by the clay-animation geniuses at Aardman Animations one of the most satisfying is seeing the physical evidence of art that in an era of virtual this and computer-generated that is still adamantly handmade. Using plasticine assorted bits and bobs from the junk drawer and unfettered imagination the writers and animators at Aardman have succeeded in enchanting kids and their parents alike. Theyve perfected the elusive art of combining memorable characters (Wallace and Gromit a dotty British inventor and his trusty and far smarter dog in ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit""; Rocky and Ginger the leading rooster and hen respectively of ""Chicken Run"") with fast-moving subtly cheeky stories resulting in family entertainments made all the more appealing by their primitive production values. So Aardman fans may approach ""Flushed Away"" the creative teams first foray into computer animation with some trepidation. Is the title all too prescient? Has Aardman abandoned its low-tech principles? Fear not This critic and thumbprint purist is happy to report that the Aardman charm is still intact and indeed enhanced by the new possibilities offered by state-of-the-art circuitry. (Another first is ""Flushed Aways"" PG rating which should not deter parents from taking young children to a film that delighted children as young as 5 at a recent screening.) The difference can be seen in ""Flushed Aways"" opening scene where we meet a pet mouse named Roddy (voiced by Hugh Jackman) living in a spanking-clean white apartment in the posh London neighborhood of Kensington. Roddys cage is an elegantly wrought Victorian number and sits amid a vast expanse of pristine chicness a tundra of deep-pile carpet and flawlessly designed furniture that would cost a fortune and take a century to portray in old Aardman style. But the benefits of 21st-century technology really come to the fore after Roddy meets an interloper named Sid (Shane Richie) a grungy gutter rat who is unexpectedly burped up into the kitchen sink one day while Roddys human family is on vacation. Push comes to shove the latter being to Roddy as Sid unceremoniously sends him spinning down the loo. When the pampered Roddy finally bobs up in a sewer he discovers an entire miniaturized London down there its streets replaced by Venice-like canals (and about as sweet-smelling). As in so many classic cartoons the point of ""Flushed Away"" is for our hero to get home. To help him in his suitably archetypal journey the sweet-natured if slightly soft Roddy enlists the help of Rita (Kate Winslet) a plucky boat captain who while aiding Roddy must also do battle with a villain named the Toad (Ian McKellen doing his best Sydney Greenstreet impersonation). After some initial misunderstandings (did we note that Roddy is a bit soft?) and more than a few encounters with Toads hapless henchmen (Andy Serkis and Bill Nighy) as well as his super-evil French cousin Le Frog (Jean Reno) Roddy and Rita make their way through the viscous seas of the sewer not only getting home but saving the whole rodent-infested city. The synopsis of ""Flushed Away"" barely does justice to a movie that delivers a good story and spellbinding action to kids and a nearly nonstop barrage of laughs for their adult companions. In addition to the sly humor to be found in the background of every Aardman production (labels for Costly Crackers and Stumblers Whiskey a wall papered with news stories about the ""Veggy Monster"" from ""The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"") ""Flushed Away"" features a hilarious running gag in the form of a Greek chorus of singing slugs who harmonize at opportune moments on everything from ""Dont Worry Be Happy"" to ""Mr. Lonely."" Even though theyve been drafted on a computer those spineless blobs bear all the physical simplicity and facial expressiveness of Aardmans best-loved clay characters and even at the height of their derring-do Roddy and Rita move like theyre in a movie from another less slick era. But its the derring-do where the computer really comes in handy ""Flushed Away"" is by far the most ambitious Aardman feature when it comes to set pieces a high-speed chase (with Toads helpers on electric mixers) and a tidal wave created by the Big Flush during halftime of the World Cup soccer final. Whether its the understated elegance of Roddys Kensington digs the cheerful squalor of Ritas family home or Toads beloved collection of royal-family kitsch the world of ""Flushed Away"" is consistently alive with color texture humor and feeling. Its what weve come to expect from Aardman and happily its what weve gotten from them once again. Cheers mates and well done. Flushed Away (86 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for crude humor and some profanity.

With Hugh Jackman Kate Winslet. (86 min.)This computer-animated feature is consistently inventive if a bit busy and overlong. Set mostly beneath the streets of London its about Roddy St. James (Hugh Jackman) a dapper pet mouse residing in a posh home who gets flushed into the world below. There he meets a street-smart rat Rita (Kate Winslet) and the big bad Toad (a standout Ian McKellen). The movie is both child-friendly and in its frequent jokes and topical references adult-friendly too. What it lacks is the heart to make it really stick in the imagination. Grade B+- Peter RainerSex/Nudity 3 mild instances of innuendo. Violence 13 scenes of cartoonish violence. Profanity None. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 1 scene with drinking. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Wondrous Oblivion (PG)Director Paul Morrison. With Delroy Lindo Sam Smith. (106 min.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 This well-meaning but conventional coming-of-age drama is set in a South London neighborhood in the 60s. David Wiseman (Sam Smith) is the 11-year-old son of Polish and German Jewish immigrants and has a passion for cricket not matched by his abilities. When a Jamaican family moves next door the father Dennis Samuels (Delroy Lindo) erects a cricket net in his backyard to Davids immense delight. Racial tensions escalate. As a portrait of a boy coming to terms with the racism that is all around him ""Wondrous Oblivion"" is hampered by Smiths wide-eyed performance. But Lindo gives a powerhouse performance of immense feeling and subtlety. Grade B- P.R.Still in ReleaseThe Departed (R)Director Martin Scorsese. With Matt Damon Jack Nicholson Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Wahlberg. (152 min.)""The Departed"" is about both crooks and cops - though some of the cops are technically crooks. The setting is Boston rather than New York. What really links the police and the perps is their almost Joycean love of language. One could argue that ""The Departed"" is not much of a stretch for Scorsese. But why complain when youre having so much fun? Grade A- P.R.The Prestige (PG-13)Director Christopher Nolan. With Hugh Jackman Christian Bale Scarlett Johansson. (128 min.)After the surprise success of ""The Illusionist"" ""The Prestige"" about dueling magicians in 19th-century England may not seem like such a commercial long shot. I wasnt nuts about ""The Illusionist"" but was reasonably entertained. Im also not crazy about plot-heavy ""Prestige"" but it has its moments too. Jackman and Bale play the rivals Johansson is the magicians assistant who shuttles between them and Michael Caine the best in the bunch plays their mentor. Nolan fresh from his pitch-black Batman once again goes heavy on the chiaroscuro. Grade B- P.R.

"Flushed Away | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; flushed-away ) Flushed Away (United Kingdom/United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli In the past few years CGI animated films have fallen into a depressing rut. The objective has become getting a product out the door rather than taking the time and effort to produce something memorable. The result has been a generic formulaic market where every new movie looks like all the rest. Flushed Away is a breath of fresh air. Yes its about talking animals but there are no attempts at making these two-legged approximations look like annoyingly cute versions of their real-world four-legged counterparts. The animation eschews detail in favor of something brighter and more cheerful. If the whole thing resembles Wallace and Gromit its no coincidence. Flushed Away is the first CGI feature from Aardman the British animation company behind this years Oscar winner. For Flushed Away Aardman has moved away from their stop-motion bread-and-butter. The reason too many water scenes and its notoriously difficult to apply Aardmans usual approach to such sequences. The CGI has been designed to replicate the look and feel of clay animation and the result is convincing. Flushed Away fits in with Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit and reminds us how entertaining an animated movie can be when its smart enough to make anyone over eight chuckle and smile. Roddy (voice of Hugh Jackman) is a domesticated rat born and bred as the pet of a little girl. When she and her family go away on a vacation Roddy slips out of his gilded cage and gets the run of the house - for a little while then Sid (Shane Richie) arrives. Hes a sewer rat who has come up through the drains and wants the house all to himself so he can watch the World Cup finals. So to get rid of Roddy he does the most expedient thing flushes him down the toilet. Roddy finds himself in a strange subterranean world filled with rats toads and frogs. He makes a deal with Rita (Kate Winslet) the owner of a boat. If she can get him home hell reward her with jewels. However the pair runs afoul of Boss Toad (Ian McKellan) who sends his henchmen Spike (Andy Serkis) and Whitey (Bill Nighy) and his cousin Le Frog (Jena Reno) after them. Eventually it becomes apparent that Roddy and Ritas journey isnt just a chase to escape the sewers but a quest to save the subterranean world from Toads mad schemes. Flushed Away contains plenty of the elements that make animated movies popular with children animals bright colors bodily function gags and video game-style action. Many recent animated films have stopped there content to delight the under-10 crowd. Flushed Aways agenda is more ambitious. It contains comedy aimed at an older audience and adds shades of characterization that adults will appreciate more than their offspring. Almost everyone however will get the Finding Nemo reference (""Have you seen my dad?"") and its innocuous enough that Disney shouldnt be annoyed. The voice casting is genius big names whose vocal work doesnt raise images of their real-life faces. Hugh Jackmans voice has an ""everyman"" quality. (Or should that be ""every rat?"") Kate Winslets Rita is sassy but doesnt sound like Titanics Rose. One possible reason Winslet has made so many movies with an American accent that it has become unusual to hear her speak without one. Ian McKellan pumps up his voice to ostentatious levels that recall neither Gandalf nor Magneto. The strategy is magnificent use big names to pull in an audience and enhance credibility but present their voices in a way that enhances the movie rather than creating a distraction. Flushed Aways co-directors David Bowers and Sam Fell have worked hard to ensure that this movie stays true to the Aardman appeal and they have succeeded. Its hard to imagine anyone who appreciated Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit not liking this movie. Sure the visuals may not be as eye-popping as in more slickly animated movies but that has always been part of Aardmans charm. There arent wall-to-wall pop tunes but the few that are used are well placed. (Any Tom Jones fans out there?) Theres also a moral about the importance of friends and family over material possessions although its not hammered home with the inelegance one has come to expect from the genre. Its a shame that Dreamworks is dumping this film into theaters in early November sandwiched between the forgettable (and forgotten) Open Season and the presumed animated king of the holidays Happy Feet. While its true that Flushed Away isnt in the top echelon of CGI features occupied by Toy Story Shrek and The Incredibles its better than 90% of the animated fare of the last few years. Its refreshing not to have to qualify the movies appeal by appending the words ""for the kids.""

The latest collaboration between DreamWorks and Britains sublimely bent Aardman studio Flushed Away is a true hybrid. Its the tale of an upper-crust pet mouse named Roddy St. James (voiced by Hugh Jackman as an ingratiatingly polite nerd) who gets flushed down a toilet and into the scavenger-happy sewer world under the streets of London. The movie has the fish-out-of-water arc youd expect in a mainstream kiddie bash as well as a sculpty CGI sheen that engagingly mimics without quite reproducing the thumbprint tactility of Aardmans clay-figure style. Yet it also has a great deal of the Aardman spirit. In the sewer Roddy discovers a squalid overstuffed metropolis of rodents amphibians and shabby discarded bric-a-brac (kitchen tools become power boats cheap souvenirs priceless treasures) and characters who have imposing egos whether its the Toad a genocidal frog king (an operatically funny Ian McKellen) still pining for when he was Prince Charles pet or a crew of maggots who burst into ""Dont Worry Be Happy"" at just the right moment. Flushed Away lacks the action-contraption dottiness of a Wallace and Gromit adventure but it hits its own sweet spot of demented delight.

British drollery is fueled by American aggressiveness to mixed results in ""Flushed Away."" This first adventure in computer animation by Blightys celebrated Aardman studio succeeds in retaining the trademark look of the companys clay figure stop-motion ""Wallace amp; Gromit"" classics and ""Chicken Run."" But the tone has become more than a bit coarse as if the filmmakers had heeded a call to compete with some of the more raucous animated hits of recent vintage. Result is a kidpic long on invention but short on likability indicating midrange commercial results with the target market. While the setting of so many of the top-grossing animated features not to mention a certain TV cartoon starring a sponge has been the deep blue sea ""Flushed Away"" is set in a bustling border town right on the H2O divide the sewers of London where all manner of creatures end up. The principals are mice and rats from very different ends of the class spectrum. From up top comes Roddy St. James (voiced by Hugh Jackman) a Kensington pet mouse whose posh life is rudely intruded upon by uncouth sewer rat Sid (Shane Richie) who takes over the impeccably appointed flat and flushes Roddy down the loo. Thus does Roddy end up down under so to speak in a raucous community that cleverly mirrors the one above it. This intricately detailed reimagining of London made entirely from salvaged garbage remnants -- Big Ben contains elements from a house clock a washing machine and cups among other items -- may be the films most considerable achievement; its a modern London with a 19th century rude vitality an environment with which the long-pampered Roddy is ill suited to cope. The prospects for Roddy making his way back home appear remote for a number of reasons. Beyond logistics the feisty community is about to be put under siege by the Toad (Ian McKellen) a former privileged pet himself whose malevolence and girth qualify him as an amphibian Jabba the Hutt; his strategy for flooding little London is genuinely inspired. But before he can implement his plan Toad along with his ratty minions (Bill Nighy Andy Serkis) busies himself trying to do away with Roddy and his new pal of convenience Rita (Kate Winslet) a working-class rat whose trawler may offer a means of escape. In a film of less than embraceable characters redheaded Rita stands out as a singular creation a tough rough-around-the-edges scrapper who wouldnt normally give a wuss like Roddy the time of day but soon takes up the challenge of his rescue. As directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell first-time feature helmers with long-term Aardman affiliations the film boasts undeniably smart and eye-catching qualities that are significantly diluted by the relentlessly frantic and overbearing behavior of most characters; someone is always loudly imposing himself upon another to diminishing returns of enjoyment. When Roddy and Rita finally get a couple of quiet moments to themselves the lack of general noise comes as a welcome but nonetheless startling relief. And it could be that Roddy comes off as rather less charming than might have been intended. Despite Jackmans smooth ingratiating delivery Roddy is simply too useless -- especially in the shadow of Winslets vigorously voiced can-do Rita -- to be very interesting. Other characterizations notably McKellens expansively theatrical Toad a creature of elegant offensiveness and Jean Renos as Toads verrry French cousin Le Frog who insists upon a five-hour dinner break before pursuing pressing matters are flavorsome. Despite having been created on a computer rather than physically molded the critters still possess the lumpen forehead and brow-dominant characteristics commonly associated with Aardman. The underground settings and free-associating decor elements create a dark jumbled look quite at odds with the crisp clean colorations of most mainstream computer animation. Harry Gregson-Williams score is an energetic asset. Flushed AwayProductionA Paramount release of a DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Features presentation.
