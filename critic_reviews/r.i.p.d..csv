"Its a Crime R.I.P.D. Is DOA << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Its a Crime R.I.P.D. Is DOA Universal Pictures Movies July 19 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Every once in a while you see a bad movie and wonder how more of them arent worse -- a film so shitty on so many levels that you cant believe no one involved with the production could see that nothing was working. R.I.P.D. is that kind of bad. Its so bad it puts other movies badness in a new light. What was so tiresome about Man of Steel so careless of World War Z and so depressing in Grown Ups 2 doesnt matter when youre faced with something that feels more like a willful accident than a film. But R.I.P.D. isnt an accident. Someone said ""yes"" to everything weve paid to see. Someone said ""yes"" to taking the murdered Patrick Swayze character in Ghost and making him a cop in the afterlife. Someone said ""yes"" to pairing that cop with a gunslinging Wild West lawman and having the two of them do a sad version of what Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones do in the Men in Black movies. And because someone said ""yes"" to 3-D you have to pay about 16 to see all of this. These are not absolutely objectionable choices. Just stupid ones. Ghost is Ghost. And Ghost worked because you believed that Swayze loved Demi Moore and that she loved him and that Whoopi Goldberg was a very funny (if obviously problematic) conduit for the metaphysical and supernatural extension of that love. Just remake Ghost. Or just do another Nicholas Sparks movie -- those are Ghost in platform flip-flops. But it seems unwise to turn Ghost into another movie that trashes a city (Boston) and in which the odd-couple cops try to stop the backstabbing Tony Goldwyn character from Ghost -- played by Kevin Bacon here using his Mystic River accent -- from assembling a device that opens a portal that will send what appears to be a gushing cyclone of billions of undead monsters to Earth. But someone said ""yes."" Someone also said ""yes"" to the title R.I.P.D. wagering that no one would think the resulting movie would be about cops in Rhode Island and that it would be good enough to overcome the inevitable puns and putdowns that the title so desperately invites. They also said ""yes"" to casting Ryan Reynolds as the Swayze cop and Jeff Bridges as Wild Westman. Theyre so bad together that you wonder if they shot their scenes separately and just spliced them together. As it is theyre acting past each other. Much has been made about how Johnny Depp has entombed himself in riskless caricature. Well Bridges appears to be equally stuck. This might be the third movie hes made in the last six years in which I had no idea what he was saying for long stretches. Hes become grizzled and gravelly. He likes his Big Lebowski Dude persona so much that hes just Zen-ed out now. Here its like a Parrothead doing dinner theater at a drive-in. Because Bridges and Reynoldss zombie-hunting police work requires them to walk undetected among clueless earthlings the R.I.P.D. fashions each officer with an avatar. So in various cutaways Reynoldss character becomes a schlumpy Chinese American grandpa played by the 84-year-old showbiz veteran James Hong. Bridges becomes a babe played by the swimsuit model Marisa Miller whose participation brings chilling clarity to a possible universe in which summer movies are distributed by GoDaddy. Poor Stephanie Szostak is in the Demi Moore part. She played a screenwriters predictable fantasy of a sexy French lover in Dinner for Schmucks a movie thats like having a hippopotamus sit on your face. If shes worse off here its only because the hippopotamus has a bigger ass. More than once R.I.P.D. reminded me of Ralph Bakshis Cool World a fantasy that strived to combine live-action and animation crime sex and critters. That movie didnt work for the opposite reason that R.I.P.D. doesnt. In almost every scene you could feel someone saying ""no."" But at least with Bakshi there was a vision at work. Robert Schwentke directed R.I.P.D. -- which has been adapted from a graphic novel by Peter M. Lenkov -- and presumably someone said ""yes"" to him because his previous action movie Red was a hit. (Its more fun sequel opens this weekend with a different director.) In fact someone appears to have said ""yes"" to Schwentke over and over. ""Yes"" to putting Mary-Louise Parker (who plays the humorless dispatcher) in white go-go boots. ""Yes"" to effects that dont always seemed finished. And worst of all ""yes"" to making the zombies computer-generated grotesques that run up and down skyscraper facades and do very little to distinguish themselves as creatures an audience would find funny or scary or interesting. I watched this movie with three chatty strangers on Thursday night in an otherwise empty theater. Universal couldnt say ""no."" Looks like thats our job now.

Comments (2) click to enlarge R.I.P.D. 3D Recommended Video Rated PG-13  98 minutes  2013 As demonstrated by RED and now this Dark Horse Comics adaptation director Robert Schwentke seems to really get the look and feel of comic books. His frames are packed with funny little details and his action scenes convey a sense of swift concentrated movement. Ryan Reynolds plays a recently deceased cop recruited by a supernatural law-enforcement agency to capture evil spirits who have snuck back to earth. Grandly spoofing his performance in True Grit Jeff Bridges plays his partner a lawman who died in the 19th century and still complains about the coyotes who ate his corpse. This spends little time on exposition and doesnt go in for any false pathos; compared with most recent comic-book movies this is lean unpretentious filmmaking--and to my taste a lot more fun for it.

Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds are two dead cops in the summers most inert movie By Richard Corliss July 19 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Scott Garfield / Universal Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture On a torrid late afternoon in Manhattan Universal Pictures finally let critics see its action comedy R.I.P.D. starring Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds as a pair of deceased lawmen who return to modern Boston to confront a horde of zombies called ""Deados."" The movie based on Peter M. Lenkovs Dark Horse comic book arrived with its own stench of decay. A dozen years in gestation with an announced budget of 135 million this knockoff mashup of Ghostbusters and Men in Black bore the mark of a zombie artifact -- hence the screening for critics just hours before the picture would open for business. Less a bad movie than simply not a movie R.I.P.D. gives every indication of having been a sloppy first-draft script (by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi) that the producers in a strange spasm of innovation and despair said ""Aaah what the hell lets just shoot the damn thing."" Any consideration of the film deserves the same level of carelessness no artful shaping of the review no arduously composed lede and capper. So here is a rough transcription of my notes scribbled in the 3-D dark while sitting through the summers most inert film.              Nick (Reynolds) a Boston cop on detail with his partner Bobby Hayes (Kevin Bacon in the familiar Kevin Bacon sleaze-bag role) finds a stash of gold that they decide to keep. Nick has second thoughts since hes a good guy at heart and Hayes shoots him in the face. The dead Nick is slowly sucked into the sky -- along with Catholics below the age of six R.I.P.D. believes that Heaven is ""up"" -- where he lands in the office of Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker) the head of the Rest in Peace Department. She explains his mission but it was hard to concentrate since Parker is upstaged by a bottle of Fresca she keeps on her otherwise pristine desktop. For the sake of the bottom line I hope the Coca-Cola Company paid 135 million for this product placement.              Nick is partnered with a Wyatt Earp-type named Roysephus Pulsipher (Bridges) the veteran peace officer -- 19th century -- to Nicks raw recruit. They head back to Boston for a case that will of course lead to the stolen gold and its ultimate cataclysmic Raiders of the Lost Ark-ish purpose. On Earth humans including Nicks wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak) see him not as his hunky self but as an older Chinese guy (James Hong); Roy has the Earth avatar of a blond bombshell (Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Marisa Miller). But the weirdest body switch is in the movies casting Bridges role was originally to be played by Zach Galifianakis. The wardrobe department must have had to make some serious adjustments to Roys couture.     The pitch meeting ""Its old cop young cop only theyre both dead and back on Earth like Warren Beatty in Heaven Can Wait."" David Dobkin who had directed mismatched buddies (in the Jackie Chan-Owen Wilson Shanghai Knights) and a Ryan Reynolds body-switch comedy (The Change-Up) eventually passed the reins to Robert Schwentke who made his feature-film debut with an old-cop young-cop drama (Tattoo) and then directed a teleporting-body romance (The Time Travelers Wife). Wondering though Was there a director on the set during the R.I.P.D. shoot? Or is this the first film made by an intern while the real director was at lunch?     A half-hour into the film and it feels like the eighth day of jury duty.     Being dead has its advantages like not dying when falling from a tall building. When Roy does that and lands on Nick the tough old dude gives the callow young one his first compliment ""You have a very impressive crumple zone."" Reynolds who can attribute his career success less to his acting teacher than to his personal trainer usually gets to display acres of his perfect torso but not here. The star has two new movies this week -- the other is the DreamWorks animated feature Turbo for which he provides the title voice -- and his fans get hardly a glimpse of Reynolds with his shirt off.     Parker is also in two movies this weekend R.I.P.D. and Red 2. She must wish as we all do that Weeds were still occupying her time.     And Bridges He should think about mothballing that ""coot"" character he played in Men Who Stare at Goats Crazy Heart and True Grit. The varmint swagger and the intonations steeped in tobacco juice were fine once or twice but outsize is not the right size for a performer long acclaimed for his range and subtlety. Im starting to think that The Big Lebowski was a stroke of great bad fortune for Bridges; he kind of stopped being an actor and embraced the cartoon excesses of a character actor. Or worse just a character. If the R.I.P.D. producers wanted a big comic turn from a Lebowski star they should have hired John Goodman who at least has the girth to match his comic grandeur.     Its an oven outside the theater but the slate of this weeks new pictures -- the horror film The Conjuring a minor cartoon feature called Turbo a Red sequel and this -- makes it seem like January in July. Is the glut of summer blockbuster wannabes over? For the last two months we were at least allowed the hope of Hollywood at its muscular commercial best. Judging from R.I.P.D. the dumpster season has arrived early.     For an expensive summer movie R.I.P.D. looks pretty cheesy. The production design of the Heaven or Limbo sets look as if they were cobbled together by someone who saw Brazil when he was a kid applied some of Terry Gilliams steampunk gadgetry then tried to blend it with the sterility of a dentists office. The Deados are transformed into Incredible Hulk-style monsters through CGI effects that are about as sophisticated as the rubber masks in an Ed Wood movie. If you must watch the undead running amok in a large city see World War Z.     Boston has to get its priorities aligned. Three months ago the people in charge shut down the city for a day to chase one guy (whos on the cover of the Rolling Stone this week). But at the end of R.I.P.D. when the undead unleash their rampage theres barely a living cop in sight.     The movie is almost over. I now feel as if Ive been strapped into a hospital bed and the wall TV is blaring a Here Comes Honey Boo-Boo marathon and I cant reach the remote.     The Manhattan heat wave stalled the subway train I usually take to midtown. After the movie I stood for nearly a half-hour with hundreds of other sweltering commuters in the 42nd Street station until someone -- not a Transit employee just a helpful civilian -- announced that no trains would be coming. That was a draining annoying experience but easier to take than the 96 minutes of R.I.P.D.

Slate Summer Movie Contest Can You Come Up With a Title Dumber Than R.I.P.D.? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 19 2013 549 PM R.I.P.D. Like an episode of Scooby-Doo thats been translated into another language and then back into English. Plus The Slate summer movie contest By Dana Stevens Jeff Bridges stars as sheriff Roy Pulsifer in R.I.P.D. Photo courtesy Universal Pictures R.I.P.D. an action comedy about undead cop buddies starring Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds is getting some good advance buzz as a front-runner for the single worst movie of 2013. Its currently at a pitiful 12 percent on Rotten Tomatoes and those few critics who did bother to review it have called it ""terribly made from stem to stern"" ""so bad it puts other movies badness in a new light"" ""the worst comic-book adaptation since Jonah Hex"" and ""not so much of a movie as it is a movie-like substance."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. As adapted by screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi from Peter M. Lenkovs comic series and directed by Robert Schwentke (Red) R.I.P.D. appears to have been shooting for some sort of wiseass Men in Black buddy-comedy vibe. But with its low-stakes chase scenes obvious-from-the-get-go villains and nonsensical plotting this feels more like a 96-minute-long episode of Scooby-Doo thats been laboriously translated into another language and then back into English. You can almost hear the scritch of boxes being checked off as tediously familiar elements are introduced one by one the honest young Boston cop Nick (Reynolds); his pretty adoring French wife Julia (Stephanie Szostak); and the corrupt partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) who convinces Nick to join him in stealing some gold theyve seized in a raid. (If only some of the money spent to convert this movie into muddy-looking supremely unnecessary 3-D had been diverted to the props budget maybe the gold pieces--which later become important to the plot--would look less like spray-painted chunks of gravel.) The next day at work Nick tells Hayes hes planning to report the gold to their superiors and come clean. No problem bro responds Hayes mildly making it clear to anyone whos ever seen a movie that hell be doing his partner in at the first available opportunity. That opportunity comes during the next big drug bust when Hayes takes advantage of the confusion to send Nick through that great digitally animated swirling cloud-funnel in the sky. But instead of heaven or hell Nick winds up in the law-keeping purgatory of the title the Rest in Peace Department where deceased cops who did wrong during their lifetimes are sentenced to centuries-long stints back on earth as undercover agents. Theres some promise to a scene in which Nicks papers are processed by a dryly efficient officer at the R.I.P.D.s front desk (played by Mary-Louise Parker with one of this movies few hints of zing). But the imaginary world that this scene hints at a Beetlejuice-like bureaucracy of undead public servants is never explored or even reintroduced. Advertisement Though he spent 15 years in the force on earth Nick is condescendingly nicknamed ""Rook"" by his new partner the cranky Wild West marshal Roycephus Pulsifer Roy for short (Jeff Bridges). Their mission to capture and kill the roving evildoers known as ""deados"" who--let me just lay this out as I best understood it--are dead criminals who go around in normal alive-seeming bodies committing crimes until such time as they are exposed to the sight of someone eating Indian food (or in a pinch just blowing a cloud of cumin on them). Only then do they morph into their true monstrous selves--not zombies or vampires but big bloated slobs with flabby wattles and sometimes grotesquely large mouths? And they can only be killed by means of a special glowing white bullet that erases their souls entirely from existence? Oh and both deados and R.I.P.D. cops can fall from skyscrapers or be run over by buses with no visible damage which makes all of this movies many car chases fistfights and hanging-from-a-great-height-by-one-hand moments singularly uninvolving. R.I.P.D. has one promising gag (besides its title) the conceit that as they walk among the living Roy and Nick are only visible as their undercover ""avatars"" in Roys case a cartoonishly sexy buxom blonde (Marisa Miller) and in Nicks a self-described ""old Chinese guy"" (James Hong). There are infinite comic possibilities in the idea of wearing a different racial gender or age identity as a disguise but the film barely nods in their direction. For example its frequently suggested that the grizzled goateed Roy isnt above using his hot female avatars body as bait to lure bad guys into a trap. So wheres our payoff scene where a grabby villain suddenly realizes hes lusting after not a beautiful young woman but a 150-year-old undead male cop? Nowhere thats where--its as if the screenwriters forgot between one scene and the next what tools they had at their disposal. I wish I could say that the presence of Jeff Bridges who usually does make everything better did something to juice up the energy level of the anemic R.I.P.D. But Bridges is uncharacteristically strained and un-Dude-like; he and Reynolds (who can at his best be an able comic foil) seem embarrassed by the transparent wan-ness of their own banter. And maybe its just the ugly sloppily animated monsters who are constantly interposing themselves between the leads but the two actors at times appear to be shooting two different movies one about a sensitive young cop learning to accept his own mortality the other about a rootin tootin cowboy marshal bouncing off high-rise balconies. Both of those movies combined would not be as terrible as this one.  Advertisement Seeing R.I.P.D. was however worth it for one reason It gave me a peg however flimsy on which to hang this years Slate summer movies contest. R.I.P.D. is one of those high-concept low-quality projects that like Snakes on a Plane must necessarily exist because its title can be imagined. Can you come up with another portmanteau acronym that brings together sets of significant initials from usually disparate fields of endeavor use it to title a proposed summer movie and slap a poster-ready tagline on that sucker? Here are one Slate wits sample entries Ph.D.O.A. The murder is unsolved but this detective has a thesis. MIAARP Grandmas gone missing. Send your entries to slatemoviesgmail.com by Monday at 500 p.m. Eastern using the subject line ""summer movie contest 2013."" Ill write up the best examples in a follow-up column and bestow upon the best title and tagline a piece of Slate swag worthy of the fine cinematic product that suggested this contest.

Ryan Reynolds stars as Nick your average Boston cop trying to do right by his city by arresting bad guys -- and trying to do right by his bank account by stealing the bad dudes weird-looking gold pieces (which look bits of spray-painted Styrofoam pilfered from a storage bin of ""Indiana Jones"" props). Hes in on it with another cop his partner and buddy Hayes (Kevin Bacon) who doesnt feel as morally conflicted as Nick about the theft. When Nick tries to pull the plug on scheme he gets plugged instead and is sucked into an afterlife that looks and operates like a brighter Rube Goldberg-esque ""Brazil"" bureaucracy. Its not heaven. And despite appearances it aint hell either. Its the Rest in Peace Department an agency charged with the task of ridding Earth of ""Dead-Os"" wayward evil spirits. Nick the newbie and smart-aleck rogue (the same character Reynolds always plays basically) gets teamed up with Roy Pulsipher an 1800s-era Wild West lawman who plays out like a cross between John Wayne and Foghorn Leghorn. Hes played inexplicably by slumming Oscar-winner Jeff Bridges whos too good for this movie by every possible metric. You want to find some modicum of joy in watching Bridges ham it up as a funhouse version of his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit"" but mostly its just embarrassing. Theres no joy to be had in watching Bridges spit and holler through a mouthful of masticated Indian food curry spittle dripping from his goatee. Yeah we get that in 3-D but Reynolds never even takes his shirt off. Some popcorn flick. The high-jinks on Earth are tired on arrival long before the film even runs them into the ground. There are the repetitive sight gags based on Roy and Nicks earthly avatars. They cant very well appear as their old dead selves so Roy passes as a hot leggy blonde while Nick is saddled with an old Chinese dude. You know whats inherently funny about a pretty woman hanging out with a Chinese guy? Nothing. Same goes for the monster seemingly modeled after Fat Bastard of Austin Powers fame with his CGI gut and plumbers butt wiggling so close to your face in eye-popping 3-D you can almost smell the Cheetos. Its an unpleasant way to pass a couple summer hours. And its bad enough to make one worried for Reynolds who still hasnt shaken off the stink of 2011s ""Green Lantern."" If youre going to aim this low for leading roles at least have some fun with it. We hear ""Sharknado 2"" is casting soon. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it (Left to right) Ryan Reynolds Mary-Louise Parker and Jeff Bridges in ""R.I.P.D."" (Universal Pictures) By Stephanie Merry July 19 2013 Follow stephmerry I cant be the only one who thought the concept for ""R.I.P.D."" sounded sort of promising and not just because its one of the few non-sequels this summer. Think of it as ""Ghost"" meets ""Men in Black"" this tale of a recently-deceased cop recruited to the Rest in Peace Department and partnered with a gunslinging Wild West lawman. The mismatched pair is tasked with capturing rotting spirits who roam the earth but the rookie is more interested in avenging his murder and communicating with his beloved wife. You can skip the ""I told you so."" I admit it I was wrong. The comic book-based ""R.I.P.D."" is a dud that squanders a decent cast and succeeds neither as the comedy nor the action film it purports to be. Ryan Reynolds plays Nick the newbie and Jeff Bridges takes the role of his partner Roy. They meet when Nick is sucked into a CGI vortex just after his evil partner Bobby (Kevin Bacon playing the caricature of a villain) offs him. Up until this point -- meaning the first few minutes of the movie -- Reynolds does what he does best which is toss off sardonic one-liners. But as soon as Nick meets his new partner its clear this is going to be the Roy Show. The problem is that Roy is not nearly as funny as the movies writers think he is. Most of the time he simply laments how coyotes and vultures snacked on his dead body and pulled his bones into a cave after he bit the dust back in the 1800s. Talk about a laugh riot. There is also some sense that director Robert Schwentke told Bridges to do an imitation of himself portraying Rooster Cogburn in ""True Grit."" With the exception of the eye patch the resemblance is uncanny as is the garbled lilt. The biggest running gag involves Nick and Roys human avatars as the undead officers must be disguised as real people while visiting earth. So Nick looks like an elderly Asian man (played by James Hong) and Roy is Victorias Secret model Marisa Miller. This revelation is somewhat amusing the first go-round when a couple of guys whistle at Roy. But by the time he yells at a man about female objectification the comedy has drained out of the scenario. The afterlife turns out to be a bureaucratic nightmare complete with an Eternal Affairs department and what amounts to a human resources orientation leader played by Mary-Louise Parker. The barely clever wordplay and heaven-sent red tape is the peak of the films humor. Nick and Roy spend much of the movie chasing and fighting computer-generated deados but suspense disappears once its clear the two protagonists are very nearly invincible. They fly off buildings and get squashed by buses but manage to immediately rebound. The sliver of a chance the pair could die (again) isnt enough to get an audience invested in their fates. In fact if Roy had disappeared the movie might have been so much more enjoyable. Maybe those coyotes had the right idea. r PG-13. At are theaters. Contains action violence and language. 96 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(Scott Garfield) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday July 19 2013 315 PM Title R.I.P.D. Film Info With Jeff Bridges Ryan Reynolds Kevin Bacon Two dead cops fight monstrous demons intent on taking over Earth. (136) PG-13 Comic- book-style violence. Area theaters. There are a few genres where tone is king and the supernatural-comedy adventure is right up there. Go the right way and you have ""Ghostbusters"" ""Big Trouble in Little China"" or the original ""Men in Black."" Make a wrong turn and you have ""Howard the Duck"" the Ralph Fiennes-Uma Thurman ""The Avengers"" or now ""R.I.P.D."" Filled with the kind of stilted repartee and magic-guns-blazing shenanigans one would expect but with none of the verve or originality one would hope for ""R.I.P.D."" at least has Jeff Bridges but even though the once-and-forever Dude abides by the rules of the game he cant raise the pulse on this bomb. Ryan Reynolds plays Nick Walker a Boston cop whos killed by his partner (an over-twitchy Kevin Bacon) for a cache of gold they found. Plucked from oblivion by a sexy afterlife bureaucrat (Mary-Louise Parker) Nick is assigned to the Rest In Peace Department - R.I.P.D. - and charged with nabbing the monsters disguised as humans (theyre called ""deados"") who evade eternal judgment. Nicks new partner is Roy Pulsifer (Bridges) a drawlin rootin tootin no-B.S. remnant of the Old West whos been marshallin under the tombstones for over a century. He teaches the rookie the ropes and together Roy and Nick uncover a deado plot to rebuild the ""Staff of Jericho"" which will allow the evil dead to reclaim the Earth. The pair star as two cops dispatched by the otherworldly Rest In Peace Department to protect and serve the living from supernatural threats. (Universal Pictures) Based on a graphic novel the comic-book concept sounds easy enough. But its a labor of lurch for director Robert Schwentke (""Red"") and writers Matt Manfredi Phil Hay and David Dobkin (check out the scripts theyve worked on collectively or alone ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" ""Clash of the Titans"" ""Aeon Flux"" ""The Tuxedo."" Yeesh). Theres very little fun beyond Bridges yokum-pocus and scene-chewing which while fun for a while grows as tiresome as a one-man rodeo. Reynolds does his insouciant quippy thing that seemed fresh around the time of ""Van Wilder"" or ""Blade Trinity"" but which in the wake of ""Green Lantern"" comes off now as sort of quiche-y. Even the special effects look more like ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" than anything else. The studio hid ""R.I.P.D."" until the last possible moment which makes sense until you realize that in a summer already full of bombastic bumbles its nothing special. Which sort of makes it a loser all the way round. Expect a sad afterlife for it on cable. Check out ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs.-Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710-AM.

In theaters on July 19 2013. Photo Credit Universal Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A slain Boston cop joins a supernatural police force. Rated PG-13 (violence sci-fi/fantasy action some sensuality and language including sex references. BOTTOM LINE A too-close cousin of ""Men in Black"" but flashes of wit and oddball humor help keep this undead comedy alive. CAST Ryan Reynolds Jeff Bridges Mary-Louise Parker LENGTH 136 The supernatural action-comedy ""R.I.P.D."" starring Ryan Reynolds as a dead Boston cop who joins a rather different police force in the afterlife crept quietly into theaters Friday after being screened for critics only Thursday night -- too late for most newspaper deadlines. Its a vote of no confidence that means that the studio would rather see no reviews than lousy ones. Universal Pictures should have had more faith. Despite its flaws ""R.I.P.D."" is a fairly entertaining and frequently funny movie. It never quite finds the right tone and it often overestimates the freshness of its ideas. What makes it entertaining though are the occasional curveballs of loopy humor most of which come from Reynolds co-star Jeff Bridges. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? As a Wild West-era lawman named Roy Pulsifer partner to Reynolds Nick Walker Bridges mixes some of his best-known roles The hard-bitten marshal of ""True Grit"" the country singer of ""Crazy Heart"" (Pulsifer croons a bit) and of course The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski."" As a result Bridges character -- despite the cartoonish Custer-style mustache -- is enjoyably unpredictable and disarming. Even his throwaway scenes with Mary-Louise Parker as a fetching undead bureaucrat have flashes of real chemistry. The films larger conceits fall flat. The notion of a weird world unseen by humans but monitored by an elite force is breathlessly unveiled by director Robert Schwentke (2010s ""RED"") as if none of us had ever seen ""Men in Black"" or ""Ghostbusters."" The monsters in this film called ""deados"" are overly familiar normal-looking folks who can suddenly turn into icky-sticky grotesqueries. The added wrinkle of the deados being grossed out by Indian food is too random to be truly funny but Bridges rescues the joke by shoving fistfuls of tandoori into his mouth with wild abandon. Our hero Nick is another forgettable role for Reynolds but Kevin Bacon as a crooked cop adds a little edge to the proceedings. The best moments in ""R.I.P.D."" come when you least expect them. Stay for the closing credits to hear a delightfully harebrained ballad co-written and sung by Bridges called ""The Better Man."" 300 MoviesR.I.P.D. trailer PLOT A slain Boston cop joins a supernatural police force. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (violence sci-fi/fantasy action some sensuality and language including sex references CAST Ryan Reynolds Jeff Bridges Mary-Louise Parker LENGTH 136 BOTTOM LINE A too-close cousin of ""Men in Black"" but flashes of wit and oddball humor help keep this undead comedy alive.

"R.I.P.D. is DOA review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesR.I.P.D. is DOA reviewR.I.P.D. based on the 1999 comic of the same name is a derivative partially saved by a good cast.By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentFri. July 19 2013R.I.P.D.Starring Jeff Bridges Ryan Reynolds Kevin Bacon and Mary-Louise Parker. Directed by Robert Schwentke. 96 minutes. Opens July 19 at major theatres. PGAs R.I.P.D. unfolds on the screen before us one cant help but wonder what the heck Jeff Bridges is doing there.Playing long-deceased 19th-century marshal Roy Pulsifer hes partnered with freshly dead partner Boston cop Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) a pair of ghost busters in the Rest In Peace Department whose job is to track down the dead who are masquerading as the living to avoid judgment day. Theyre called ""dead-os"" (though deadbeats might have been funnier).Article Continued BelowThe idle thought nags again and again why is a character actor of Bridges pedigree slumming it in a CGI-bloated 3D-infused paranormal buddy comedy like R.I.P.D.?Does Bridges have tax problems on the scale of Nicolas Cage who has taken a paycheque from all sorts of dubious movies in recent years?Based on the 1999 comic book by Peter Lenkov R.I.P.D. will face the eventual comparison with the Men in Black franchise -- with ghosts instead of extraterrestrials as the main menace. Unlike M.I.B. R.I.P.D. is unlikely to spawn a series of successful sequels.The story opens with Walkers voice-over ""You think youve had a bad day at work. I think Ive got you beat"" as Pulsifer and Walker deal with a wily Fat Elvis dead-o who gives them the finger and says ""thank you very much"" before making good his getaway.Flashback three or four days earlier and we see Walker in the course of busting a meth lab gunned down by his partner Bobby all because he wants to return some gold the two swiped in an earlier bust. Walker is immediately beamed up to a CGI funnel cloud where his new ghost-busting job -- as penance -- awaits.As it turns out the gold is crucial to the plot set to become part of something called the Staff of Jericho which will somehow reverse the natural order of things returning the dead to Earth and -- natch -- dooming humankind. (Cue eyes rolling heavenward.) To their credit the oddball partners play things relatively straight. Bridges delivering dialogue as if his cheeks are stuffed with chewing tobacco gamely tries to breathe life into Pulsifers character though it takes a while to warm to him.Reynolds plays Walker with doe-eyed seriousness as a man mourning his own death and losing the love of his lie Julia (Stephanie Szostak). Awkward at first the interplay between the Pulsifer and Walker actually improves as the film progresses.Mary-Louise Parker is wonderfully wry as the officious Proctor who oversees the ghost hunters and Kevin Bacon as the villainous Bobby is as reliable as ever.There are a couple of decent laughs in the avatars -- a buxom blond and an old Chinese guy -- that the two officers appear as in the living world. Director Robert Schwentke (RED Flightplan) does a fine job of handling the action sequences and the 3D actually works. But some of the CGI stuff especially the dead-os are overblown and silly. Then theres the painfully stupid plot which makes the film though barely more than 90 minutes feel much longer.The likeliest reaction from the audience? Lets spell it out R.I.P.D.

"Review R.I.P.D. an unholy mess that ghostly cops cant save - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review R.I.P.D. an unholy mess that ghostly cops cant save R.I.P.D McClatchy-Tribune Jeff Bridges left and Ryan Reynolds headline the 3D supernatural action-adventure ""R.I.P.D."" as two cops dispatched by the otherworldly Rest In Peace Department to protect and serve the living from an increasingly destructive array of creatures who refuse to move peacefully into the afterlife. Jeff Bridges left and Ryan Reynolds headline the 3D supernatural action-adventure ""R.I.P.D."" as two cops dispatched by the otherworldly Rest In Peace Department to protect and serve the living from an increasingly destructive array of creatures who refuse to move peacefully into the afterlife. (McClatchy-Tribune) Mark Olsen The premise of ""R.I.P.D."" is that there is a secret supernatural police force that protects an unknowing humanity from bad souls who want to escape their eternal damnation. So a just-dead Boston cop (Ryan Reynolds) killed by his crooked partner (Kevin Bacon) is paired up with an Old West lawman (Jeff Bridges). Overseen by a mod-era bureau chief (Mary-Louise Parker) the new duo must stop a growing swarm of bad guys from rebuilding an ancient contraption that would reverse the flow of souls to the afterlife flooding the world with the evil and dead.Directed by Robert Schwentke from a screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi and based on a series of graphic novels that premise opens up the need for quite a bit of explaining. The early sections of the movie consist largely of Bridges explaining to Reynolds which guns and bullets work on who how people see you when youre dead how they get from one world to another and so on trying in vain to preempt all the questions a viewer winds up asking oneself anyway through the rest of the film. PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Attempting to review this film its tempting to cut-and-paste turns of phrase from other reviews as ""R.I.P.D."" feels so cobbled together from other movies a bit of ""Men in Black"" here a touch of ""Ghostbusters"" there. The entire film has an oddly underdone quality to it as if aiming not for greatness but to simply be passable. One of the films main conceits is that the living see officers of the R.I.P.D. (""Rest in Peace Department"") as avatars someone else and so Bridges takes the form of a model-ready blond (model Marisa Miller) and Reynolds an elderly Chinese man (veteran character actor James Hong). The idea gets referenced a lot mostly smarmy guys checking out Bridges with leering looks but it comes across as not entirely thought through and underutilized. Even the films Boston setting used so well in crime films like ""The Departed"" and ""The Town"" seems somehow underexploited given the films buddy-cop bones.ON LOCATION Where the cameras roll     The film is a visual mess with cheap-looking effects hampered even further by crummy and unconvincing 3-D. (Anyone who insists on seeing this movie -- because a relative or neighbor worked on it perhaps -- will certainly get better value for the money by skipping the 3-D.) The film frequently runs into what has become the true scourge of modern cinema of scale that once the screen becomes dominated by computer generated imagery the brain somehow unconsciously picks up that its all zeros and ones dancing about and the heart checks out. With anything made possible too often nothing matters.  A rare spot of wit involves Reynolds asking Parker why Steely Dan music is always playing in her office. It genuinely feels like people just passing the time waiting for whatever it is they are supposed to be doing to get started. A viewer grows to know the feeling well. ""R.I.P.D."" arrives in theaters on a wave of vaguely bad buzz and perhaps worse general indifference as the clunky noisy and confused film feels like make-work for all involved. mark.olsenlatimes.com---------------------------R.I.P.D.MPAA rating PG-13 for violence sci-fi/fantasy action some sensuality and language including sex references.Running time 1 hour and 36 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies R.I.P.D.

Thank heavens -- or at least the ""Department of Eternal Affairs"" -- for Jeff Bridges whose hilariously free-associative performance as a 19th-century frontier marshal-turned-21st-century undead lawman is like an adrenaline shot to the heart of ""R.I.P.D."" A generally uninspired mashup of ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Men in Black"" (plus a sprinkling of ""Big Trouble in Little China"") the film is most notable for having had its obituary written by the press and even its own studios marketing department well before its release. While the end product still seems all but certain to turn up DOA at this weekends box office the pic itself isnt quite the calamity some portended due largely to Bridges some genuinely impressive visual effects and one of the few running times of the season well under two hours.This story first appeared in the July 23 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Like most of the summers other headline-grabbing underperformers (""After Earth"" ""White House Down"" ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Pacific Rim"") ""R.I.P.D."" bears the lipstick traces of a hoped-for franchise starter with a comicbook pedigree buddy-movie architecture and the nine-figure budget that seems to have become the universally accepted price of doing business in todays Hollywood. At least it can be said that the money is on the screen here especially during a Doomsday finale that turns downtown Boston into a kind of Wild West of the living dead. Whats most lacking is that thing only time -- not money -- can buy a truly inventive and original script. (Pic was adapted by the ""Clash of the Titans"" team of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi from Peter M. Lenkovs Dark Horse comic series.) SEE ALSO Box Office Two Ryan Reynolds Misfires in One Weekend? Not exactly zombies in the classical sense the pics pesky ""deados"" are troubled souls who thanks to the equivalent of a clerical error in the great cosmic filing cabinet have remained stuck on Earth instead of moving on to heaven or hell. The longer a deado stays in the world of the living the more trouble it causes; hence the need for the titular Rest in Peace Department deceased police officers who themselves manage to postpone Judgment Day by rooting out unruly deados one beastie at a time. Minimum term of service a century. New to the force is Reynolds Nick Walker first seen among the living as one of Beantowns not-quite finest a 15-year veteran of the force who has recently in a moment of weakness stolen evidence from a bust together with his longtime partner Bobby (Kevin Bacon). When Nick confides that hes having second thoughts and wishes to turn himself in Bobby responds sympathetically by putting a bullet through his partners face. At R.I.P.D. central a busy hive of activity clearly modeled on production designer Bo Welchs ""Men in Black"" HQ Nick finds himself briefed by a world-weary personnel manager (sly sardonic Mary-Louise Parker in the pics answer to Rip Torns Agent Zed) then paired with Roy (short for ""Roycephus"") Pulsifer a Stetson-wearing six-shooter-twirling anachronism played by Bridges as a cross between ""True Grits"" Rooster Cogburn and Yosemite Sam. After that its back to Boston where Nick and Roy quickly pick up the scent of a deado conspiracy to rebuild an ancient totem (known as the Staff of Jericho) capable of reversing the order of the cosmos and literally making the dead rain down upon the living. PHOTOS Ryan Reynolds Career by the Numbers The flimsy setup is basically an excuse for a series of run-ins between the officers and the deados who walk the streets disguised as humans but whose beastly selves can be lured out (in an amusingly dada conceit) by Indian spices. The elaborate creature transformations can be fun to watch though none of the deados leave in individual impression on par with say ""Ghostbuster""s beloved Slimer. In one of the pics promising but underutilized comic ideas R.I.P.D. officers themselves appear disguised on Earth -- a system designed to prevent them from reaching out to former loved ones. For Nick this means he becomes a doddering old Chinese man (veteran character actor James Hong) waving a banana instead of a gun while Roy becomes a whiplash-inducing buxom blonde (supermodel Marisa Miller). But director Robert Schwentke doesnt seem to have figured out how to make the transitions work visually and in the end the very game Hong and Miller have perhaps two minutes of screen time between them. Reynolds who proved himself a deft comic performer in 2005s ""Just Friends"" is largely confined to the straight-man role here. Bridges however hurls himself into Roy with such comic abandon that its tough to know how much of the character was there on the page and how much was being invented by the actor himself as he went along. (Certainly the entire movie has the feel of one in which much was made up on the fly.) Rattling his trap nonstop with a particular fondness for the gory details of his earthly demise (picked apart by coyotes in the desert) Roy doesnt suffer fools or new partners gladly but can turn suddenly fragile if anyone dares criticize him at one point whipping out a squeezebox and wailing a hilariously maudlin ballad called ""The Better Man"" (co-written by Bridges and regular Coen brothers collaborator T-Bone Burnett). Like Johnny Depps work in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies its a performance that seems to say ""Look Im here for the payday. You know it. I know it. But as long as Im here Im going to make things interesting for myself."" Moment by moment ""R.I.P.D."" is diverting enough to keep 8-year-olds -- and inner 8-year-olds -- entertained as the mercury rises and the A/C struggles to keep up. But the premise and isolated bits throughout glimmer with just enough promise to make you wish Joe Dante had directed this in his prime or anyone with more of a feel for comedy than Schwentke who brings the same slickly professional but style-less sheen to everything he does whether claustrophobic thriller (""Flightplan"") romantic melodrama (""The Time Travelers Wife"") or ostensible farce.

Jardoness says August 12 2013 at 728 pm A thorough and deservedly scathing review. Laying the results at the feet of the genre or the mash-up of material it sought to draw from belies a systemic issue with the industry itself as it suffers all the drawbacks of manufacturing (derivative shoddy and cookie-cutter) but enjoys none of its advantages (experience consistency or economy). R.I.P.D. couldve been a good movie. As mentioned it drew from; ""Ghostbusters"" ""Men in Black"" ""Big Trouble in Little China"" and ""Beetlejuice""... And yet with all that and a budget which no doubt exceeded them all put together the filmmakers only demonstrated what little they learned and how thoroughly overwhelmed they were... Unfortunately its titles not only an epitaph but a punchline. Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 19 2013 at 348 am How many times? Pacific Rim is NOT an underperformed It in fact has over-performed in the North American market and is relying on and has ALWAYS BEEN relying on big takings in China South Korea Japan Thailand and Russia. Only South Korea and Russia have opened so far and BOTH of those opened well enough to suggest that the film could get close to the takings of Transformers 3 (A different genre but perhaps the closet we can get to a barometer for Pac Rim). That being the case if the film grosses midway between Transformers 1 (lowest grossing) and Transformers 3(highest grossing) at these markets four of which are the home of these genres) then it would gross over m from those markets alone. Theres also the fact that the film is pacing ahead of the like of Rise of The Apes World War Z and Prometheus all of which easily surpassed m internationally. So with a target of 400m - 450m to be ""good enough for profit once TV Blu-ray and rental kick in and hence a Franchise despite a box office loss( just like Batman Begins Star Trek (2009) Snow White amp; The Huntsman and Tron Legacy) and a target of 450m -500m to hit profit at the box office we are way to close to the films beginning to start calling it an underperformed. It is by no means outlandish to think that the film could make 100m in North America and 250m= in the Oriental market s and Russia. Leaving the whole of the rest of the planet to get from 50m to 150m; out of the question? No. If anything it is what you should expect to happen; the failure the big loss that is the long-shot the less likely outcome. Of course this homage to the DaiKaiju and giant Mech genres could be hated by the masters of the genres and the film could open huge and tail off quickly you can never tell in this business; but Pacific Rim opened bigger than expected in North America and is pacing ahead of several ""big"" films that gross over 250m or over 300m at the international box office; how is THAT under-performing again? Reply Jackie Jormpjomp says July 19 2013 at 902 pm You may need to come to peace with this man. Pacific Rim has made less than 60 million after one week. It still trails Grown Ups 2. Its not going to come close to making what more modestly budgeted The Heat has made and at this point doesnt look to be able to do much better than 100 mill. 100 million for that flick is not going to instigate a ticket tape parade. It just means a few less execs wont jump out of a higher window. Saying it did better than expected opening weekend is only a reflection how HOW MUCH WORSE it could have done. 25 million expectation is not a mind blowing hurdle to clear. At a 200 mill price tag plus over another hundred in marketing its an under performer. That doesnt mean it should have any impact on your enjoyment of the finished product at all. I saw the Rocketeer to a standing ovation audience back in the 90s and that movie tanked with general audiences. Does it mean anything to my enjoyment of that movie? Nope. I personally loved the John Carter movie. I enjoyed Waterworld (actually now that is one that did at least a bit better than its reputation brining in over a hundred mill more than budget) and Big Trouble in Little China is one of my favorite movies. I would have loved to see any of these as franchises. The cold reality like Buckaroo Banzai is that there isnt going to be a Pacific Rim 2. There could be an anime or heavens forbid a straight to video follow up but Pacific Rim is not blowing up Hollywoods skirt. If it was anything close to not being a headache youd be seeing articles written like what has been done for World War Z. Reply Zak says July 19 2013 at 331 am This review wasnt the least bit harsh. Its actually one of the nicer reviews that I have read. I read no bashing of Ryan Reynolds what-so-ever. Why are you defending an awful looking movie that even the studio thinks is awful? Do you have money in this soon to be flop or something? Reply See All 4 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO Boss Talks True Detective Season 3 Deadwood Movie...

In comedies filmmakers often render the infinite and otherworldly in the mundane human terms of bureaucracy with all the waiting rooms Muzak and impossible regulatory complexities that depiction implies. We cant really envision an afterlife that isnt somehow modeled on our own psychic landscape. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - So it goes in R.I.P.D. After being shot in the face by fellow crooked cop Kevin Bacon deceased detective Nick Walker (Ryan Reynolds) ascends through swirling cloud orifices into the human resources office of the afterlifes Rest in Peace Department. Mary-Louise Parker explains that due to his law-enforcement acumen hes been recruited for service in the RIPD instead of consigned to Hell and assigns him to veteran officer Roy Pulsifer (lovable old Jeff Bridges) a lawman shot and killed -- and then eaten by coyotes -- in the 19th century.Yes its a purgatorial ripoff of the entire plot of Men in Black. The script reverses the principal roles casting the experienced Roy as the wisecracking loose cannon and rookie Nick as a serious determined lawman. Bridges endows the insouciant Roy with that voice he does the one that sounds like hes got an egg yolk in his mouth and hes trying not to break it. And Reynolds does a lot of stony glaring. Film Details R.I.P.D. RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time96 More Info Trailer Unfortunately the interesting drabness of the afterlifes police department is paired with the colorless paucity of the films heavies -- rubbery monstrous ""deados""deceased souls who have refused the call of the afterlife and linger on Earth with auras of bad karma causing decay and unhappiness among the living. The menagerie of aliens in Men in Black was usually funny and engaging. The deados unmemorable CG brutes spout generic bad-guy dialogue undistinguished by humor or characterization. Parkers charisma shines through all the uninspired banter. Theres one pretty funny Steely Dan joke. And the Boston RIPD precinct is staffed with dead cops from hundreds of years of Boston history all wearing the uniforms of their eras The existential white of the office bustles with Victorian mustaches bobby helmets 40s-era snap-brim fedoras close-quarters SWAT gear and cowboy hats. Its the real world that seems strangely under-populated the films climactic apocalypse unfurling in empty Boston streets unwitnessed by anyone who isnt already dead. How scary is the apocalypse if theres nobody around for it to scare?A word to cinematographers If you know in advance that the studio will push your two-dimensional film through a shitty postproduction 3D conversion please turn the fucking lights up on set. The bottom-shelf techniques here exhibit all the worst traits of the format obvious View-MasterDlike image layers with noticeable dimness and low contrast. On the other hand R.I.P.D. does offer a pretty good idea of what the afterlife might look like to someone suffering macular degeneration.Follow VoiceFilmClub1 James Hong and Marisa Miller in R.I.P.D.

Review Its Nearly Epic in Its Mediocrity By    Alonso Duralde on July 19 2013  1000 am Follow aduralde Email Print Related R.I.P.D. Is D.O.A. With Critics Ryan Reynolds battles walking corpses -- and a dead script In a season of retreads reboots and adaptations ""R.I.P.D."" is nearly epic in its mediocrity. When historians look back at this by-the-numbers era of studio summer blockbusters they may well point to this film as being notably iconic in its lack of original ideas its staggering predictability and its thorough blandness. ""R.I.P.D."" feels like the result of a process in which the screenplay was skipped entirely replaced instead by a binder full of studio notes which was somehow given to the cast and crew and brought to the big screen. Also read R.I.P.D. Is D.O.A. With Critics The credits claim that Phil Hay and Matt Mandredi with a story assist from David Dobkin are adapting the comic book by Peter M. Lenkov but viewers with a nose for leftovers will detect a stew of familiar flavors. The movie cobbles together any number of past hits -- ""Ghost"" ""Ghostbusters"" ""Men in Black"" ""Beetlejuice"" with Jeff Bridges lazily reprising bits of his ""True Grit"" performance for good measure -- and the results feel rote and trite like a mid-1980s NBC pilot designed to take the 900 hour between ""Misfits of Science"" and ""Manimal."" Ryan Reynolds stars as Boston cop Nick; he and partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) have just stolen some chunks of gold from a drug dealer they arrested but Nick is having second thoughts. Subsequently when the two of them are raiding a meth dealers warehouse Hayes shoots Nick in the face with one of the bad guys guns. (Thanks to the PG-13 rating this shooting and every other one in the film occur without one drop of blood being spilled.) Nick ascends into the afterlife but since hes got the gold robbery on his conscience heavenly desk-jockey Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker) offers Nick the chance to improve his Judgment Day odds by spending 100 years on the R.I.P.D. an angelic department dedicated to tracking down ""dead-os"" who are malingering on earth and dispatching them to the great beyond. In true cop-show fashion Nick immediately despises his new partner former Old West sheriff Roy (Bridges). Their first stop back on earth is Nicks funeral but when the dead cop tries communicating with his widow (Stephanie Szostak) he learns that the living see him as an elderly Chinese man (legendary character actor James Hong) while everyone perceives Roy as a curvy blonde (Marisa Miller). The audience however perceives this gag as not all that funny the first time and even less so the dozen-plus times its reprised. Turns out the gold chunks are part of a mystical whatchamacallit that will bring legions of the dead back to earth and Nick and Roy are the only ones who can stop it and yadda yadda apocalypse. Director Robert Schwentke (""Red"" ""The Time Travelers Wife"") finds a few moments of visual dazzle mostly involving the afterlife and the tunnel through which one arrives there but hes stacked the movie with the same computer-generated beasties and chase scenes weve seen a million times. This crushing familiarity also extends to the performances whereby talented actors are reduced to finding one note and playing it ad infinitum over the films 96-minutes-that-feel-like-180 running time. Perhaps the most crushed by the goings-on is the normally affable Reynolds who has a gift for smart-ass dialogue. Here the light in his eyes seems to have been extinguished resulting in a performance that has all the enthusiasm of a hostage reading a political manifesto written by his captors. Everything wraps up with an ending that portends a sequel but most viewers will forget ""R.I.P.D."" at approximately the moment they dispose of their empty soda cups in the lobby.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Nothing short of wiping their memories with a real-life neuralizer is going to convince moviegoers that the supernatural buddy-cop comedy R.I.P.D. is anything more than a thinly disguised Men In Black ripoff. Yes the two films are based on entirely different comic-book series but all that proves is that somewhere along the way during the late-90s conception of this new property or during its transport from page to screen someone realized that minor tweaks could be made to a winning formula. Consider the facts An acronym-monikered agency mired in bureaucracy and hidden from the public unleashes mismatched officers--one a grizzled veteran the other a dynamic rookie--onto the streets of a major city where they round up strange creatures masquerading as humans. But wait the R.I.P.D. team might protest there are some differences The illegal aliens for example arent aliens at all but fugitive souls who have escaped judgment and returned to Earth to wreak havoc. Here the young cop is pokerfaced and the old one is a cutup. And theyre both white And neither wears sunglasses Proving yet again that only his physique qualifies him for blockbuster duty Ryan Reynolds looks eternally bored playing the reluctant hero a Boston cop who catches some friendly (and fatal) fire from crooked partner Kevin Bacon. After wandering through a freeze-frame tableau of his moment of death--a pretty cool sight truth be told--the slain officer is yanked skyward and plunked down at the desk of snarky celestial commissioner Mary-Louise Parker. Faced with the choice between instant afterlife sentencing and joining the Rest In Peace Department to pay off some karmic debt Reynolds opts for the latter and is promptly paired off with a salty 19th century lawman (Jeff Bridges putting a dopey but not altogether unlikable spin on Rooster Cogburn). When not trading insults this odd couple trades fire with the ""deados"" during weightless action scenes that combine the whip-pan camerawork of an arcade shooter with the rubbery cartoonish CGI of a Stephen Chow movie. Much as hed rather be ghosting with his widowed wife (Stephanie Szostak) Reynolds starts chasing leads; can he learn to trust his new partner long enough to blow the lid off an undead conspiracy? Like the 1997 mega-hit it constantly unflatteringly resembles R.I.P.D. fares best when getting into the humorous nitty-gritty of its world an HQ intercom system that plays nothing but Steely Dan a culinary variation on the Replicant test etc. Speaking of Blade Runner James Hong plays Reynolds undercover disguise in a cameo; a gag lifted from Heaven Can Wait finds the DOA detectives not looking like themselves to the living. (Here and there Bridges has great fun getting into the character of his avatar the Amazonian supermodel Marisa Miller.) This is far and away the movies most fruitful concept but director Robert Schwentke (Red) basically wastes it leaning on the supposed hilarity of an old Chinese man kicking it with a blonde goddess. Why not play instead with the comic frustration of essentially being trapped in someone elses body? Oh right. Because Men In Black didnt do that.

"R.I.P.D. | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; r-i-p-d ) R.I.P.D. (United States 2013) July 19 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its difficult to pinpoint how R.I.P.D. fell into the rat-hole in which it exists. Is the problem the director? The screenwriters? Did the studio step in and sabotage the production teams creative vision? Regardless in R.I.P.D. we have a legitimate train wreck of a motion picture a film that doesnt work on any level. Its not funny. Its not exciting. Its not engaging. Its a waste of time and money. Having seen it I can understand why it was hidden from critics. The disappointment is that it wasnt hidden from everyone else as well. On paper it doesnt sound too bad a couple of dead cops - old West lawman Roy (Jeff Bridges) and Boston P.D. cop Nick (Ryan Reynolds) - return to Earth as agents for the R.I.P.D. (Rest In Peace Department) in different bodies to send people who have cheated death to their judgments. In the course of their investigations they learn that a group of these ""Deaders"" led by Nicks dastardly ex-partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) are assembling an ancient artifact that when completed will allow them to trigger the apocalypse. So yes this is yet another 2013 movie that explores the end of the world. Are we as a society that obsessed with Armageddon or is it just Hollywood? The problems begin with the screenplay which is credited to Phil Hay amp; Matt Manfredi and is based on the Dark Horse comic. Are these two actually responsible for the lifeless script or did someone else have a hand in it? I dont know the answer but a look at Hay amp; Manfredis filmography doesnt inspire confidence (Aeon Flux Clash of the Titans 2010). Everything about R.I.P.D. is wrong starting with a storyline that belongs to a bad Men in Black sequel and ending with a mismatched buddy aspect that never gels. The movie tries to play up the comedic half of its DNA but its rarely funny. Viewers can see when the movie is straining to get laughs and the result is weak and meager. And to add insult to injury the special effects are anything but ""special."" Much of the creature design is shoddy and its execution is questionable. The only thing of note is the ""freeze frame"" effect that occurs at the moment of death (and has a character wander around a setting where time is stopped) - thats effectively accomplished. Buddy movies thrive on chemistry and theres none evident here. Jeff Bridges is trying too hard to be The Dude in Old West duds; his attempts at extreme quirkiness are forced and plaster over his 1000-watt charisma. Ryan Reynolds looks bored. His expression suggests that he cant believe he allowed his agent to talk him into taking this part. The lack of an interpersonal spark isnt confined to the relationship between Bridges and Reynolds. Its also missing from the interaction between Bridges and Mary-Louise Parker (who plays the R.I.P.D. boss and Roys quasi-love interest) and Reynolds and Stephanie Szostak (who plays Nicks wife Julia). Kevin Bacon is in ""bad Kevin Bacon"" mode doing a lot of smirking and scowling. One idea that could have been interesting had it been better handled is the concept that Roy and Nick inhabit new bodies. The ""comedy"" aspect of this is that Roys avatar is a blond bombshell and Nicks is an old Asian man. The problem isnt the idea its the method of its handling. Director Robert Schwentke seems at a loss how to integrate this effectively into the story. So were given occasional glimpses of the ""appearance bodies"" but most of the time its Bridges and Reynolds. From a financial sense this is logical (since Bridges and Reynolds are getting much bigger paychecks than Marisa Miller and James Hong) but from a story standpoint its inconsistent and poorly realized and the potential for comedy isnt used to its full extent (possibly because some of the better jokes are prevented by the PG-13 rating). What surprised and disappointed me the most about R.I.P.D. is how bland the entire thing feels. The subject matter has undergone multiple layers of sanitization. The material lies on the screen rotting and festering and consuming 90 minutes from the life of every man woman and child in the audience. Its not one of those awful get-me-out-of-here motion pictures that turns into an exercise in self-immolation for those who sit through the entire thing. Instead its more likely to bring on an overpowering feeling of lethargy through boredom. Theres no discernible energy on screen and that is conferred to the audience. R.I.P.D. R.I.P. R.I.P.D.

Sure there are times youre convinced for a few minutes at least that youre watching a real movie because they trick you by trotting out things youve seen in a movie before. You know the usual suspects car chases fist fights and of course Kevin Bacon. All of these moments proudly proclaim ""Hey this is a movie"" But then sadly ""R.I.P.D."" jolts you back into reality with a scene that has no bearing on anything thats come before and that vaguely chemical taste in your mouth is the realization that theres a giant hole where the ""movie"" part of the movie should be replaced only by a massive CGI budget. It all ends up going to pieces which is a real shame because there is a legitimate film in here somewhere buried deep beneath the rubble of its terrible script and editing. However that said the premise of ""R.I.P.D"" is not a complete non-starter and in fact theres much to like during the opening half of the film. For instance the initial action scenes are handled with a certain grace the camera angles biasing toward clarity and even though it looks slightly video-gamey it also is undeniably effective. Kudos also must be given to Jeff Bridges and Mary-Louise Parker prodigious talents who are occasionally able to carry the film all by their lonesome. Indeed if the story had been entirely about them and only them tirelessly toiling away in an afterlife bureaucratic purgatory they just might have pulled it off. Bridges is goofy throughout ""R.I.P.D."" but hes earned it somehow as if were all now just tuning in to see him not whatever character hes embodying. His relationship with Parkers character is the definition of forced only it works because they are both too charming to let any one scene with the two of them fall entirely on its face. Back to the aforementioned premise a select few law enforcement officers upon their passing in the line of duty are chosen for a special branch of the afterlife the ""R.I.P.D"". Their task is to track down deceased folks who are evading judgement enterprising bad guys also known as ""deados"". When Boston Police Officer Nick (Ryan Reynolds) is gunned down during a raid hes immediately recruited by the ""R.I.P.D."" going directly from dying into a meeting with Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker) before he has any idea as to whats happening. Believing he can somehow right the wrongs of his slaying he takes the job. Hes teamed up with fellow dead person Roy (Jeff Bridges) a hard-scrabbled lawman from the late 1800s. Roy begins to show Nick the ropes and they unwittingly stumble upon a plan involving Nicks former partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) that could have cataclysmic repercussions. Which is all well and good Theres nothing in there thats so devastatingly stupid that an audience wouldnt follow happily along for we are the people who adore films about superheroes eat up fantasy and request all the science fiction you can give us. Plus when youre starting out with Mary-Louise Parker and Jeff Bridges its like holding two aces in poker any reasonable approximation of decent gameplay should leave one victorious. But its not to be because ""R.I.P.D."" makes the biggest mistake a film can make - it forgets to tell the story while at the same time believing it can take credit for telling the story. How does this manifest itself? Firstly in the odd chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Jeff Bridges. It feels as though whole sections of the film were left on the cutting room floor as ""R.I.P.D."" clearly indicates throughout that the two are at each others throats only theres no real reason as to why. One guy is older sure and one guy is a rookie okay but they start in with the ""Odd Couple"" routine after about three seconds of foreplay and then continue to trade on these unearned credits throughout the film. Introducing two characters and then having them not get along solely for the sake of taking up time isnt so much storytelling as it is throwing in the towel. Relying far too often on this forced dichotomy ""R.I.P.D."" goes completely off the rails as it should be nearing its culmination. Its almost as if they would have preferred to show a montage of ""Men in Black"" or ""Lethal Weapon"" point at the screen and then say ""thats how our guys are too"" But thats not how it works People disagreeing based upon nothing leaves an audience feeling nothing. Nothing from nothing thats ""R.I.P.D."" doing its thing. To be fair Ryan Reynolds isnt so much bad here as hes asked to do the impossible. Hey there Ryan just go ahead and 1) be a likable dead guy that 2) still somehow has unresolved business with the living world while 3) also being flawed enough that the character can experience a cathartic transformation. He doesnt pull this off even a little bit but its hard to say where the sad script choices ended and poor Ryan Reynolds began. I mean if someone tosses you a hundred pound weight as youre treading water and tells you to swim its not going to matter how buoyant you are and in ""R.I.P.D"" Reynolds sinks to the murky depths. No story to speak of forced tension and featuring unclear motivations throughout ""R.I.P.D."" proceeds to get worse and worse as the minutes drag on. Naturally they need a point of tension and that point seems to be Nicks desire to get back to his (living) wife. Or no wait maybe its Nicks plan to get revenge on his killer? Hold up its actually all about solving a mystery doing great police work even from beyond the grave in order to save the entire universe In truth ""R.I.P.D."" doesnt know what exactly its getting at so it tries a bit of everything like a puppy jumping licking and barking all at the same time. One of these will work Luckily as the film is less than 100 minutes as soon as ""R.I.P.D."" establishes its rather complicated and convoluted world logic it is forced to zip to the finale. Monsters Dead people Ancient relics threatening to undo humanity At this point of ""R.I.P.D."" its easy to have checked out for the film has nothing to say and you can only listen to the dust in the wind blowing around for so long before you just close your eyes and pray for it to end. SCORE 3.6 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and loved Ryan Reynolds in ""Definitely Maybe"". Movies R.I.P.D.

Dead lawmen Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds are assigned by the Rest in Peace Department to purge Earth of zombie monsters called Dead-Os.Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Jeff Bridges Ryan Reynolds Kevin Bacon Mary-Louise ParkerRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 36 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideJeff Bridges certainly wont be winning another best-actor Oscar for his grating performance as an after-life cop in R.I.P.D.The film ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) directed by Robert Schwentke (2010s Red) features Bridges looking like Colonel Sanders and sounding like a low-rent marble-mouth version of his Rooster Cogburn character in True Grit. Any chemistry with the partner assigned him a bland Ryan Reynolds is sorely lacking.Roy (Bridges) and Nick (Reynolds) seem patterned after the mismatched duo in Men in Black. But their one-liners fall resoundingly flat and most of the computerized special effects in this 3-D sci-fi/action adventure are garish and overbearing. At the same time the parameters of the story are bizarre to say the least.Both of these guys were lawmen Roys heyday was the Old West more than a century ago and Nick was a Boston police detective until he was shot by his conniving partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon).REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarTheyre assigned by the wise-cracking Proctor (Mary-Louise Parker) of the Rest in Peace Department to catch a subclass of creatures known as Dead-Os -- deceased bad guys who somehow escaped judgment and have returned to Earth masquerading as humans.Dead-Os are a decidedly unattractive bunch bent on world domination. Its up to Roy and Nick to stop a potential apocalypse.Heres the ah-ha moment If someone eats Indian food in front of these nefarious zombie types the creatures true selves will come forth. Say what?Perhaps there was a clever germ of an idea here but the five credited writers didnt develop characters scenarios or rules in this sci-fi world well enough to engage the audience.One of the few notable scenes occurs just after Nicks shooting death inside a warehouse. Just after he expires all activity around him is frozen. He walks through this suspended world and then is sucked into the clouds. The effect is visually intriguing as it captures Nicks last Earthly memories in a freeze-frame.A recurring gag centers on how differently the living see these dead officers. They can be perceived but not as their former selves. The goateed Roy takes the form of a blonde bombshell (Marisa Miller). Nicks avatar is an elderly Chinese man (James Hong).Theres an unhealthy dose of bathroom humor and plentiful mind-numbing destruction by way of car crashes building explosions and shoot-outs with giant weaponry.The action is hectic rather than exciting and lacks visual panache. The computer-generated Dead-Os are badly configured eyesores thudding around clumsily wreaking havoc like less impressive versions of The Incredible Hulk.While Bridges chews the scenery with his garrulous Southern-accented chatter Reynolds is too restrained. Theres little sign of the easy charm intelligence and affability both actors are known for.Based on a comic book R.I.P.D. reinforces the point that not every graphic novel should be adapted to film. 75 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 23 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/12NlUJz,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/07/19/ripd-review/2438431/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29,200,r.i.p.d.20,r.i.p.d.,usatoday

Film Review 1224 AM PDT 7/19/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Another summer super-production bites the dust. TWITTER Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds star in a 3D supernatural action romp about two dead cops sent back from the netherworld to save humanity. R.I.P.D. arrives in a state of advanced rigor mortis. Except for an enjoyably lip-smacking scenery-and-CGI-chewing Old West-guy performance by Jeff Bridges who by now must have played more Western characters than any other actor of his generation this is a second-rate special effects-dominated 3D entry that will join several prominent would-be blockbusters that need not be mentioned on the summer junk heap. With an announced budget of 130 million Universal will have to take this one on the chin but on balance the distributor and producer Neal H. Moritz will still have come out well ahead for the season on the basis of Fast amp; Furious 6. A zombie movie in all but name this jocular and cheesy adaptation by Clash of the Titans screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi of Peter M. Lenkovs 2001 Dark Horse comic quartet might have been better conceived as the beginning of a lower-budget more modestly aimed franchise along the lines of the Hellboy entries. But as a major undertaking with clear sequel ambitions theres just not enough new and exciting here to cut it; when the brief 96-minute running time is one of its two or three only virtues you know youre in trouble. PHOTOS Jeff Bridges Career in Pictures If Boston was feeling left out of the wave of cinematic civic destruction that has in recent times claimed New York Washington Philadelphia Chicago San Francisco and Los Angeles among others Beantown now can proudly join the club as cretins called ""deados"" give it quite a going-over as they stage their assault on humanity. That their plot to do so has to be one of the most cockamamie schemes ever cooked up by modern screenwriters -- it has to do with the full reassembling of an ancient golden Staff of Jericho monument triggering a downpour of zombies errr deados from the heavens -- is not sufficiently embraced as ridiculous by director Robert Schwentke (Red). Perhaps if Mel Brooks could have been induced to make a big-screen comeback with a zombie genre send-up as a sort of companion piece to Spaceballs we would have had something worth watching. In fact Brooks could have had a field day with an underplayed aspect of the basic premise. At the outset Ryan Reynolds Boston cop Nick is murdered by his partner Hayes (Kevin Bacon) over some pieces of the gold whereupon Nick is transported to a kind of purgatory (not unlike the celestial one in Raoul Walshs entertaining 1945 Jack Benny comedy The Horn Blows at Midnight) and paired with veteran Western sheriff Roy (Bridges). Sent back to Earth to pursue some justice they appear to each other and most of the time to the audience as themselves though there are momentary glimpses of how they look to unsuspecting Earthlings Nick is seen in the guise of ""an old Chinese guy"" (James Hong) while the goateed and long-haired Roy has the stunning appearance of a blond bombshell (former Victorias Secret angel and Maxim No. 1 hot Melissa Miller). Brooks would have no doubt gone for the comedy of having the two avatars onscreen far more frequently. VIDEO R.I.P.D. Trailer The Chinese substitute prevents Nick from being recognized by his beloved wife Julie (Stephanie Szostak) who is now seeing far too much of the solicitous Hayes for his liking; for his part Roy has long since become accustomed to turning heads as a busty babe. The only way the two former lawmen can put the deados out of business is to shoot them in the head using special ultra-large handguns provided by the proctor so Men in Black bounces around ones memory bank as the guys go around blowing away weird and deformed-looking members of the undead ilk while trying to figure out what the gold puzzle is all about. How R.I.P.D. otherwise spends its time is on wearily familiar old pro/young hotshot macho competitiveness with Roy holding his frontier experience over the 21st century neophyte and the latter occasionally surprising the graybeard with his abilities. Bridges rolls the words around in his mouth in all sorts of juicy permutations to fairly amusing effect just as he gets some decent mileage out of how Roy still hasnt really gotten over the manner of his death having been eaten by coyotes his bones been carried off hither and yon. But this is not the stuff of which blockbuster box office returns are made. On the technical side theres nothing new here nor can the film measure up to whats been done visually in this summers expensive commercial belly flops. The 3D here is surpassingly unimpressive and sometimes a distraction.

Every movie coming out this year but ""R.I.P.D."" should pause for a big sigh of relief The possibility of any of them being called the worst cinematic effort of 2013 has as of today just about disappeared. As for ""R.I.P.D."" Ive got some bad news for you... For a movie that so strenuously rips off ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Men in Black"" ""R.I.P.D."" manages to come up with fresh new ways of being absolutely terrible. The plot manages to be fully predictable and freakishly bonkers at the same time seemingly born of the same kind of brainstorming-on-L.S.D. session that must have given us ""Howard the Duck."" Soon-to-be ex-movie star Ryan Reynolds plays a Boston detective who is having second thoughts about keeping his share of the gold that he and his corrupt partner (Kevin Bacon) found on a raid and agreed to split. Bacon No problem bro Sorry I even brought it up Say I was thinking of going clean too Then the two leave for another dangerous raid. I think you can guess whats going to happen although on the other hand you probably wouldnt expect to see Mary-Louise Parker show up in heaven as a snotty police chief in a jumper and white knee boots who tells the now-deceased Nick (Reynolds) that he has to do 200 years on the Pearly Gates police force before he can face Judgment Day. RELATED MARISA MILLERS SEXIEST ROLE YET IN ""R.I.P.D."" Nicks partner Roy (Jeff Bridges) is a Wild West lawman who complains that when he got killed on earth coyotes ""Made love to my skull."" He patiently explains the utterly bizarre and incomprehensible rules of the movie which have something to do with bad dead people not being really dead -- they just go back to Earth and take on human form and go about their business. But If you eat Indian takeout food in front of them they reveal their true monstrous selves which resemble a cross between the Incredible Hulk and Mike Myerss Fat Bastard. Then they go rampaging around town destroying stuff like the aliens in ""Men in Black"" only this time youll wish you were the one who could have someone flash one of those gadgets in front of your face to make you forget everything youve just seen. If you kill these ""Dead-Os"" again this time by taking them out with what looks like a machine gun loaded with ping pong balls then theyre officially dead and you dont have to worry about them. RELATED OUR EXCLUSIVE STYLE SHOOT WITH MARISA MILLER But the weird is just getting started. The officers of the Rest in Peace Department -- doesnt quite work does it? They didnt get the word ""police"" in there -- are also back on Earth alive and able to do all the stuff living people do even interact with the living. The catch is that they dont look or sound like themselves to humans. Roy looks like a blonde supermodel (cue the opening notes from ""Lets Get It On"" every time we see him from a living persons point of view) while Nick is a middle-aged Chinese man. Still after a couple of visits to his dead wife (Stephanie Szostak) she starts to believe this guy is actually her dead hubby come back to visit. Seems unlikely but I guess stranger things have happened such as the greenlighting of this movie. Halfway through after weve established that Roy and Nick dont like each other (they keep throwing each other off buildings or in front of buses) we figure out where all this is leading which is that the gold Nick came across on Earth is part of an ancient spooky obelisk straight out of ""The Mummy"" that when all all the pieces fit together will cause all the evil dead of all time to rain back on Earth. Were talking millions of dead bodies -- almost as many corpses as there are Ryan Reynolds movies that died. Cue armageddon human sacrifice dogs and cats living together mass hysteria. But the obelisk can be busted and the world saved in the following secret supernatural way If you drop a car on it. If this were a Spielberg movie it would be ""Raiders of the Least Ark.""
