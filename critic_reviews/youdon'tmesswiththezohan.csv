Weary of this cycle of violence he decides to fake his death and follow his dream of becoming a hairdresser in New York City. This undeniably captivating premise turns out to be another sloppily concocted and naggingly non-controversial pretext for Sandler to pelvic thrust his way though a succession of increasingly wacky fish-out-of-water situations with the intricacies of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict dusted with sugar and served up as inane plot filler. Sandlers Zohan is a garishly sketched melange of Ali Gs gormless ladies man and Borats wide-eyed naif and despite a screenplay co-written by current comedy sage Judd Apatow hes such a jarringly two-dimensional creation that theres nowhere to send him beyond that sparklingly irreverent set-up. On the plus side the film does have an amiably dreamlike approach to cultural stereotyping for some reason plucking hummus hacky sack and an unspecified orange liquid called Fizzy Bubblech from the Israeli character profile to use at the centre of numerous recurring though frequently uninspired sight gags. John Turturro - whose scream is one of the most joyous sounds in cinema - picks up some of Sandlers slack as terrorist and kebab-shop franchisee The Phantom but its not enough to save this odd little mess.

Otherwise this is a total shambles bringing the most bizzare story plot that is confusing at most times and merely got any laughs when i went to see it at the cinemas.

It had a few of its cringing moments which it could have probably done without. Adam Sandler acted very well throughout the film with a fairly convincing middle eastern accent. However the script is its downfall there wernt that many funny jokes and gags. The jokes that were funny were only really humourous to adults jokes that children wouldnt understand. There is the odd bit of nudity here and there but is covered up in the right places and there isnt alot of foul language. 12A is about right for the age rating. Overall though I would say it was an enjoyable film with a good storyline but not so good script. Fun to watch nonetheless. I give this 3 stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 25 2008SarahFeaturedLOVED This film So yeh it was abit rudee.. but to the people who were saying it should be an 18? wth have you seen 18s? i think its good as a 12a but should mension sexual content at the start still a hilarious film a few auquard gags but id rate it 5 DFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 25 2008SarahFeaturedLOVED This film So yeh it was abit rudee.. but to the people who were saying it should be an 18? wth have you seen 18s? i think its good as a 12a but should mension sexual content at the start still a hilarious film a few auquard gags but id rate it 5 DFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 24 2008whos the daddyFeaturedslightly OTT but good jokes - a completely new view of the middle east conflict; loved the ""Hisbollah - terrorist - help line""... which was either busy or temporally suspended till break-down of peace talks... well researched and true is it?

However it has in my opinion been misclassified it should have been rated 18 due to some of the content that I do not feel young people need to see some of the sexual imagery and the scene with the cat should have been cut if it was going to be rated 12A.

Israeli/Jewish stereotypes; 2. Palestinian/Arab stereotypes; 3. Old ladies bottoms stereotypes; 4. Old ladies cleavage stereotypes; 5. Lingering shots of certain male body zones; 6. ""Cat sack"" a live-feline variation on hacky sack; 7. Long scenes in which old ladies aroused by erotic shampooing go slack in ecstasy; 8. Adam Sandler; or 9. Garlic hummus. To simplify matters You Dont Mess with the Zohan exploits all of the above. It does for the Arab-Israeli conflict and horny old women what I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry -- last summers Sandler vehicle from director Dennis Dugan -- did for gay rights cranking through booby jokes and harebrained ethnic cliches in the name of peace love and understanding. But Zohan is both exponentially stranger than Larry and about twice as amusing if we expand the definition of amusement to include repeat closeups of Sandlers prosthetically enhanced groin. In a tip of the hat or whatever to Warren Beattys swingin hairstylist in Shampoo Sandler plays a breathtakingly flexible Israeli counter-terrorist agent whos had his fill of fighting Palestinians and longs to retire to a chic Manhattan salon. ""I like hair"" he explains to his baffled parents. ""Its pleasant and its peaceful and no one gets hurt."" So driven the Zohan gets sneaky and fakes his own death during a take-down with archrival Palestinian terrorist the Phantom played by John Turturro as though he bonked his head and woke up in a Wham video (actually so does Sandler). He then stows away on a flight to America in a pet carrier with two dogs named Scrappy and Coco. They emerge with purple highlights; he emerges with an alias. As Scrappy Coco Zohan embarks on his quest to style hair and bed lonely New York biddies (""You look very bang-able Mrs. Rosen"") meeting a lovely young Palestinian (Emmanuelle Chriqui a Jewish-Moroccan-French-Canadian) along the way. Further explication of the plot would take us nowhere so lets just say that Zohan finds that Jews and Arabs have more in common than he expects principally a love of Mariah Carey. She materializes briefly near the climax one in a raft of cameos that run from stupid and humorous (Henry Winkler puking) to stupid and repellant (Chris Rock cracking a joke about genocide in an island patois). Also in evidence are several phony Middle Eastern accents that appear to stretch well beyond the Holy Land for inspiration At certain times with certain inflections Zohan sounds like Gerard Depardieu hacking up phlegm. Rob Schneider supplements his sham Palestinian accent with a fake mustache and skin tone going brownface for his art. Does any of this cross the line? Sure. Most of it does. Theres even a joke about a homemade bomb though believe it or not its funny. Dugan and Sandler -- who wrote the script with Saturday Night Live vet and Triumph the Insult Comic Dog creator Robert Smigel and the ubiquitous Judd Apatow -- enter dangerous ground when they push past the boundaries of Israel and Palestine and their juvenile send-up of a millennia-old struggle sometimes falls flat. But credit them for broaching the subject.

By David Denby The Hulk fifteen feet of lime-green power with the temperament of a nasty child.   Credit PABLO LOBATO ""The Incredible Hulk"" picks up the story of Bruce Banner--the guy with anger-management problems--some five years after the end of his tantrummy misadventures in ""Hulk."" As Bruce Edward Norton has taken over for Eric Bana and Louis Leterrier has replaced Ang Lee as director but Bruces situation remains the same--his blood is infected with gamma radiation or something or other making it unwise for his emotions to expand beyond a snit. When seriously provoked Bruce grows exponentially his muscles swelling under the skin his feet bursting through his shoes his forehead widening to the size of Washingtons brow on Mt. Rushmore. He becomes fifteen feet or so of lime-green power with the temperament of a nasty five-year-old boy--he likes to throw things. Embarrassed by his own might Bruce in his normal state has buried himself in a soft-drink bottling plant near Tavares Bastos a teeming favela outside Rio de Janeiro. He works with an anger-control guru who whams him across the face and then tells him to breathe deeply to control his feelings. The most repressed man on earth he leads a forlorn and shadowy life and Edward Norton exercising his talent for melancholy withdrawal and pained self-discipline makes him a touching haunted figure. Bruce is in hiding from General Ross (William Hurt) of the Army who wants to use Bruces genes to manufacture scores of hulking human weapons. The trouble is the way the movie presents Bruce the Generals project never makes much sense when Bruce is miffed he goes on a rampage and attacks anything within range. A multitude of Bruces could I suppose rip out Iranian nuclear installations but they would rip out American military bases too. Bruce enlarged is not controllable--thats why he scares people and himself. Bereft and friendless he cant even have sex; his rapidly beating heart would turn him into a monster. His girlfriend and lab partner back home (Liv Tyler) doesnt know where he is. Louis Leterrier (""The Transporter"") doesnt try for poetry as Ang Lee did (with mixed success) but Leterrier is marginally better than Lee at the summer-action-spectacle side of the Hulk story. General Ross gathers a commando team including a vengeful bloke played by Tim Roth (of the crooked smile) and as the team tracks Bruce down in Brazil Leterrier stages a chase with a moving camera through narrow alleys. Its nothing we havent seen done better before (by Paul Greengrass in the recent ""Bourne Ultimatum"" for instance) but its good enough as kinetic entertainment. When Bruce becomes a monster Leterrier and his C.G.I. people perform competently but without much imagination or flair the Hulk roars and thrashes about and tears a military vehicle in half and then flings the fragments at a helicopter or a tank or anything else threatening him. The effects are grand and violent but again familiar. Weve become abysmally jaded we moviegoers. Digital spectacle is both too much and too little and its beginning to put some of us in a funk of disappointment and boredom. When youve seen one half-ton piece of metal flung through the air youve seen them all. And the truth is that in any version the Hulk is a dull beast. Hes just a big angry guy; he has no soul no oddities no vulnerable or tender spots. King Kong and Frankensteins monster are Byron and Keats in comparison with the Hulk as I wrote when Ang Lees version came out. And by now the timidity and even hypocrisy of the entire conception have become depressing. After all for many of us rage while it lasts is exhilarating as well as scary--a wild ride that seems to fuel itself and go faster until it suddenly collapses. Bruce erupts and destroys things--what could be more fun for an overgrown boy? Isnt it a thrill to be that strong? And since hes impacted sexually destroying things is the only release hes going to get. If he were ambivalent about the powers that lie within him--drawn to the excitement but also repelled by it--the tension for the audience might be overwhelming because Bruces mixed emotions would speak to the way were tempted and repelled by anger too. But the movie presents Bruce conventionally as a man who has a strange hateful disease that he cant get rid of. Bruce is merely disgusted by his situation (theres no make-my-day gleam in his eye as he approaches fury) and afterward hes just exhausted and empty. If he could only describe for us the wild pleasure he feels--the allure of the forbidden struggling against morality and sense--then the movie would transcend its comic-book origins and become a kind of tragic fable of id released and regretfully tamed. But Bruce is just a decent sorrowful guy whos been dealt a bad hand and for all Nortons skill we lose interest in him. ""You Dont Mess with the Zohan"" is an obscene ridiculous and occasionally very funny movie and if it ever gets to the Middle East it will roil the falafel tables on both sides of the Arab-Israeli divide. Im not sure the picture wont panic the Middle West as well. Written by Judd Apatow Adam Sandler and Robert Smigel and directed by Dennis Dugan the auteur of ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" the movie is about a fabulous Israeli counter-terrorism agent (Sandler) who has a bulging crotch and dangerous hands (he karate-chops Palestinian machine guns into carrot sticks). Zohan however has had enough of war and ""the hate."" After an epic contest with his nemesis--an extremist Palestinian warrior known as Phantom (John Turturro)--Zohan fakes his own death leaves the tumultuous Promised Land for the slightly less crazy New World and settles in a mixed Arab and Israeli neighborhood in New York where he works in a Palestinian-owned beauty salon cutting hair. Making the ""smooth and silky"" it turns out is all he has ever wanted to do. He cuts he styles and he sleeps with the stores elderly clientele who line up on the sidewalk outside for their appointments with the Israeli wonder. Forty years ago in ""The Producers"" Zero Mostel slept with rich old ladies in order to raise money for a Broadway show; Zohan labors on behalf of a corner store demonstrating once again that small business is the soul of the American economy. The movie is agitated into being by Sandlers pelvis which constantly undulates like an industrial washing machine. As for Turturros Phantom hes not waiting for martyrdom and the seventy-two virgins; he sleeps with a harem of terrorist groupies while nurturing his own commercial longings for a shoe store in faraway America. Eventually the two men with armies of emigres behind them meet somewhere in the battle zone of lower Manhattan where the real struggle is fought against a boastful Trumpian real-estate developer and victory is measured in frontage rather than in fronts. ""Zohan"" burlesques a host of solemn and bloodstained issues turning warriors into sex hustlers and would-be Rotarians. The movie propels many liquid substances (mousse etc.) into the air; its crude beyond belief and it includes knowing jokes about the way Israelis speak English and make a living in America--jokes that may puzzle anyone west of the Monongahela. When Zohan needs to rush from neighborhood to neighborhood he rides on the top of a Moishes moving van then hops to another moving van--its the Jewish express train. The movie also devotes detailed attention to the curious procedures of Jewish-owned electronics stores which attract customers with allegedly rock-bottom prices while rapidly (but perpetually) ""going out of business."" In the new millennium we seem to be getting a genre of profane sloppily made ethnically knowing but good-hearted movies--pictures with aggressively liberal values proudly displayed beneath crummy jokes. As in the ""Harold amp; Kumar"" epics ""Zohan"" presents America as a multifarious bazaar where gangs of enraged white males who hate everybody are the only people who dont fit in. In commercial comedy mutual acceptance is now the hip mode of humor. Future academics will see ""Zohan"" as un texte obamiste. This moviegoer has no trouble with lowbrow comedy. The problem with ""Zohan"" however is that its like a kid who tells you a silly joke gets a laugh and immediately tells the same joke again. ""Zohan"" invents a few things; then it repeats and repeats. When Sandler plays Ping-Pong with a grenade or kickboxes an opponent with both feet at once the movie teases the feats that audiences know are impossible without digital. But as this kind of joke is staged over and over the media irony wears off. Digital has become so omnipresent in the summer season that even spoofing it seems secondhand. ""Zohan"" would have been funnier if it had stayed closer to realism. In the same way its funny the first few times the elderly ladies come out of their sessions with Zohan their clothes askew and their eyes glazed--as a minor outrage on sexual propriety. Zohan is presented as a saint bringing unexpected miracles into the lives of the broken-down. The hypersexed hairdresser is a satirical take on the old Warren Beatty role in ""Shampoo"" yet Beatty played the stud with a rather graceful chagrin. He was a little guilty about it while Sandler just goes on and on. Does Adam Sandler sleeping with half of New York really think hes Yahwehs gift to women?

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Israeli Stud Aspiring Hairdresser Adam Sandler makes his Jewish mother proud. Meanwhile Werner Herzog tries to avoid penguins. _ By David Edelstein Published Jun 9 2008 ShareThis (Photo Tracy Bennett/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) In You Dont Mess With the Zohan Adam Sandler is a babe magnet with the stamina to satisfy harems of hot chicks and the bounteousness to bestow his sexual favors on septuagenarians too. Hes also a virtuosic hand-to-hand-to-smelly-foot fighter with the elastic limbs of a Marvel superfreak. Hes a military heroan Israeli military hero the ultimate in Jewish-mother-pleasing accomplishments. He builds bridges between gays and straights Israelis and Palestinians. He puts out fires with hummus. He has enough confidence in his heterosexuality to dream of life as a salon stylist making hair silky-smooth. In real life Sandlers endorsement could not propel Rudy Giuliani to the presidency but he has achieved something even more improbable coaxing funny performances from Rob Schneider. Who among us cannot say This is a man? How does Sandler get by with narcissistic fantasies so far-out? One way is by turning them into camp so that he seems to be satirizing the movie-star potency hes actually peddling. The art is in the balance. Sandler never falls into the Jerry Lewis mode of naked self-infatuation. Something fogbound in his demeanor takes the edge off his self-aggrandizementa quality Paul Thomas Anderson exploited beautifully in Punch-Drunk Love in which Sandler played an emotionally overdefended child-man who floated through the world in a solipsistic (but lyrical) bubble. Like Will Ferrell Sandler has layers of tenderness under layers of irony under layers of tendernessplus a floating anger like Jupiters great red spot. BACKSTORY By mining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for comedy You Dont Mess With the Zohan triggered a level of scrutiny quite unlike the typical Adam Sandler gagfest. A spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations told the New York Times that he would be watching for anti-Arab bias I would say Im a little worried. The casts many Arab actors overcame any reservations. Sayed Badreya an Egyptian who emigrated to attend NYU film school explained part of his thinking to the Times The movie presents what happened to me. Since it happened to me it will work for someone like me. Plus his teen daughter is a huge Sandler fan. Zohan pushes the usual gross-out buttons racial-stereotype buttons and look-at-the-bazongas-on-that-stone-fox buttons. Many will be incensed by Rob Schneiders feebleminded Palestinian cabbie who still seethes over Zohans long-ago theft of his precious pet goat. (Although theyll have to get in line behind Asians still seething over Schneiders bucktoothed flied-lice Chinaman in I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry.) Schneider can be wonderful when hes focused rather than expansive and I found his undying outrage over that goat very touchingalthough it falls short admittedly as a metaphor for Palestinian historical grievances. Others will not care for the depiction of Israeli-American electronics salesmen as incorrigible bait-and-switch motormouths (Press this button you get free HBO) with the likely exception of those of us whove been browbeaten into taking home their shitty receivers. The ASPCA will not enjoy the cruelty to animals even though theyre obviously stuffed. Mariah Carey fans will not enjoy the terribleness of her acting even though shes obviously stuffed. As the Phantom Zohans Palestinian archenemy Sandler-movie stalwart John Turturro acts high on the non-halal hog at one point letting out a long warble of despair that made me laugh so hard I felt like I was warbling back. Zohan is not in the class of Sandlers I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry which as the critic Nathan Lee pointed out on its release (to many raised eyebrows) challenged the homophobia of the mainstream more aggressively than Brokeback Mountain. The script by Sandler Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow stays on the level of sketch comedy. (Whereas Chuck amp; Larry in which Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor had a hand featured actual human relationships.) But director Dennis Dugan knows his way around shin-whacking slapstick and Sandler is mesmerizing. Some performers become stars because we can read them instantly otherslike Sandlerbecause we never tire of trying to get a fix on them. We can only be sure that with Sandlers fan base there will be many more mad narcissistic fantasies to come. As a documentarian Werner Herzog approaches alien landscapes with a mixture of breathlessness and wariness. He is a driven manself-dramatizing unafraid to pose metaphysical questions unembarrassed (I surmise) at occasionally sounding like a crackpot. He empathizes with the explorers urge to measure oneself against nature even to the point of leaping into the void; yet the stories to which he gravitates are of leapers who dont respect the immensity of the natural world and are chewed and spat out by it. At first his newest film Encounters at the End of the World is unusually detached rambling in its approach to the settingAntarcticas McMurdo Stationand the sundry eccentrics who reside there. Who are these people drawn to the edge of the planet and what are their dreams? Heres a man who was a banker and then joined the Peace Corps. Heres a guy who majored in linguistics who has come to a place without peopleand hence languages. Heres a woman who can talk your head off about her death-defying treks from continent to continent. Heres where the fabled explorer Shackleton lived. Lets dive under the ice and see the bizarre spindly creatures. But midway through an eerier theme creeps in all the more powerful for Herzogs lack of insistence. By the end of the world he means the end of the world. The people hes profiling arent the overweeners pitting themselves against nature. Theyre the reporters the realists the ones who say the ground is not as solid as in our Shackleton-inspired imaginations. The ice is alivebreaking up moving in ways we can hardly imagine. Human life on the planet is not assured. We are the overweeners. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Much of it though is an inspired hilarious mess. The organizing idea -- the disorganized organizing idea -- combines Jewish James Bond webless Spider-Man and gross-out ""Shampoo."" Adam Sandlers Zohan is an Israeli counter-terrorist operative who despite his superpowers wants to be a hair stylist and make the world silky smooth. Why? Dont ask. Or ask but the answer is why not since Mr. Sandler and his co-writers Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow havent written a silky-smooth script so much as concocted a lumpy hummus of antic notions. On paper the movie must have looked invitingly idiotic. On screen it looks crazed but the comic energy is huge if indiscriminate and Mr. Sandlers performance -- think Topol doing Charles Boyer -- can be as delicate as it is gleefully vulgar or grotesque. In Israel the heros nemesis is a Palestinian terrorist the Phantom whos played by John Turturro. (The Phantom and Jesus Mr. Turturros character in ""The Big Lebowski"" could bowl on the same team.) In New York where Zohan reinvents himself as a hairdresser named Scrappy Coco he gets entry-level work in a beauty parlor owned by a lovely Palestinian -- shes played by Emmanuelle Chriqui -- but theres no rest for the combat-weary; soon hes fighting Arab terrorists anew. (The New York neighborhood with Arabs on one side of the street and Jews on the other recalls the fast-food rivalry of the Oscar-winning short ""West Bank Story."") The script serves in its scatter-shot way as a parable of endless conflict between Arabs and Jews. Yet the political parody seldom catches fire and the story stops dead in its crabwise tracks for some frantic nonsense in which a greedy landlord turns predatory developer and Mariah Carey plays herself with agonizing difficulty. ""Zohan"" which was directed by Dennis Dugan rises to its subject most reliably by aiming low -- though not so low as the dim sequence in which Zohan smuggles himself into America in the cargo hold of a jet in the company of two shaggy dogs. Mr. Sandler is at his best when Zohan sporting a pizza-size star of David is using kung fu moves to tie people (literally) in knots; strutting his stuff like a demented John Travolta; scaring a spoiled brat in the highest tradition of W.C. Fields (""When I was your age Id already killed seven men -- maybe you should grow up"") or seducing elderly patrons of his salon. When Zohan goes beyond seducing them the movie goes beyond the pale but thats not to say it isnt appallingly funny. Mongol If the Genghis Khan of ""Mongol"" were running for president hed give Hillary Obama or McCain a gallop for their money. Sergei Bodrovs thrilling steppe epic upgrades the brutal head of those bloodthirsty hordes to the status of visionary. This Mongol of all Mongols is a modern merciful leader ahead of his time -- 800 years ahead of his time. Hes so cool and self-contained in his sense of personal destiny that its no wonder scads of nomads follow him. The director who wrote the script with Arif Aliyef might have called it ""Temudgin"" though that doesnt quite sing as a selling title. Genghis Khan was born with that name in 1162 and Temudgins emergence from boyhood into full and fearless manhood is the subject of the movie the first part of a projected trilogy. The production was Kazakhstans entry for a best-foreign-film Oscar in the most recent Academy Awards but its a huge and hugely impressive international enterprise. Mr. Bodrov is the Russian filmmaker best known to American audiences for the superb 1997 drama ""Prisoner of the Mountain."" The adult Temudgin is played -- with remarkable intensity -- by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano. Honglei Sun whos Chinese is the heros blood brother and mortal enemy the mercurial funny and frightening Jamukha. Temudgins wife a beautiful woman named Borte is played by the movies only Mongolian star Khulan Chuluunn and its her first time in front of a camera. Shes a great argument for native talent and against acting classes. I dont know the Mongolian word for panache but ""Mongols"" got plenty of it. The battle scenes are as notable for their clarity as their intensity; we can follow the strategies get a sense of whos losing and whos winning. The physical production is sumptuous. (The film was shot by Sergey Trofimov who is Russian and Rogier Stoffers who is Dutch.) And through all of Temudgins extravagant trials and hard-won triumphs theres a sense of a singular child serving as father to a powerful man whose power flows from his instinctive devotion to justice and to his wife. Its an austere epic that turns the stuff of pulp adventure into a persuasive take on ancient history. Kung Fu Panda In a more mundane world than the beautiful mythical China of ""Kung Fu Panda"" the roly poly hero Po voiced by the rolyer poly Jack Black would be a candidate for Overeaters Anonymous -- he cant lay off the carbs. In the world of animated features the team responsible for this script might qualify for Underwriters Anonymous and thats no knock on the insurance industry. Most of the characters are as sketchy as the production design is inventive luminous and elegant. The essence of the film is slapsticky chopsocky action rendered with great verve and accompanied by bromides having to do with the need to believe. Po needs all the help he can get. The clumsy son of a goose who runs a noodle shop -- I dont believe the movie ever explains why a panda should have been sired by a goose -- he has dreamed of being a kung fu master. But this corpulent Asian cousin of Pooh Bear has little more than his dreams going for him when he is suddenly chosen as the Dragon Warrior -- I dont believe the movie makes much of a case for that choice either -- and expected to defend his village against a villain who has escaped from a prison with 1000 guards. (The abundance of talent on the voice track includes Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan and Randall Duk Kim.) ""Kung Fu Panda"" begins with a promise of edgy wit. ""Legend tells"" a smarmy narrator intones ""of a legendary warrior whose life was legend."" But the film soon settles into a succession of ritual spoofs of the kung fu genre and peddles the sort of cloying preachments about self-esteem and human potential -- panda potential -- that little kids hear all the time on TV. There is Pos master says no secret ingredient theres only you and your special gifts. To make something special you just have to believe its special. Yadda yadda yadda. To make a movie special its not enough to have brilliant animation. You have to believe in telling good stories. When Did You Last See Your Father? When Did You Last See Your Father?"" is an eloquent and affecting evocation of a man who remains bigger than life even as he approaches death. Its adapted from the well-known book of the same name by the English poet Blake Morrison who published his memoir in 1993 after his father had died. (Anand Tucker directed from a script by David Nicholls.) The father Arthur Morrison is played by the inimitable Jim Broadbent. The son played by Colin Firth has a lifetime of hurts to come to terms with his fathers minor duplicities major philanderings and volcanic magnetic narcissism. ""How did you put up with it?"" Blake asks his mother. (Shes played mutedly by Juliet Stevenson who is only four years older than Mr. Firth.) The answer is not easily. For mother and son alike it has taken the pain of watching him die to be able to love him for who hes been. DVD Tip In its theme Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"" (2003) strongly resembles ""When Did You Last See Your Father?"" Albert Finney is the father Edward Bloom and Billy Crudup is Will the estranged son who comes home to see the old man who is dying. But Mr. Burton fills the screen with surreal stories that Edward has told about himself. Part of Wills task is to reach an understanding that his father was to a great extent the sum total of the stories he told.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. June 6 2008 You Dont Mess  with the Zohan (out of 4)Starring Adam Sandler John Turturro Emmanuelle Chriqui. Written by Judd Apatow Robert Smigel and Adam Sandler. Directed by Dennis Dugan. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Adam Sandler who has proven many times that he can do obnoxious comes across as sweet natured in this latest comedy about an ultra-tough Mossad agent who fakes his death so he can pursue his dream which is to go to New York City and become a hairstylist. For those moviegoers with no prior knowledge of Sandler I should point out that ""ultra-tough"" doesnt mean Rambo. Rambo is a gritty portrait of realism compared to Sandlers character.What his character is about is the slapstick violence of old Popeye cartoons where the sailor eats his spinach and then sends his enemies flying. You like slapstick the more tasteless the better? Youll love the first scene of the movie when Zohan plays a game of Hacky Sack and catches the foot bag in the cleavage of his buttocks.The influence of co-writer Judd Apatow a producer who seems to have a deft touch with comedy - The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Knocked Up - is nowhere in evidence in this movie. Its Sandler all the way.That means restraint is an almost non-existent commodity. Restraint is an early scene when Zohan breaks the news of his hairstyling ambitions to his parents and they laugh genially and call him a ""faygala"" (male homosexual).Zohan is undaunted. ""Its pleasant its peaceful and nobody gets hurt"" he says quite reasonably of his new vocation.He then flies to New York City and ends up working in a small hair salon owned by Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) a beautiful Palestinian. Complications ensue when an unscrupulous Donald Trump-like real estate developer tries to seize the property for his new mall at the same time as Zohans arch-enemy the Palestinian ""Phantom"" (John Turturro) arrives in New York to rub Zohan out.As in previous Sandler movies the hero successfully wards off his enemies and gets the girl. Thats a technicality.The real business of the movie is getting laughs through any means necessary. At one point theres an overhead shot of a taxi disgorging an endless number of passengers - a variation of the old circus gag of 20 clowns climbing out of a Volkswagen. The routine completely unrelated to the plot evidently still works - the audience at the screening I attended certainly got a laugh out of it. Theres verbal humour. ""Are you bionic?"" a bystander asks after Zohan does his post-spinach Popeye routine on a foe. ""No no"" Zohan replies ""I only like girls.""Theres parody as when the Phantom to the Rocky theme song punches a side of beef - actually a live cow I presume CGI-generated. But the biggest source of humour in the movie comes from an oral fixation that would curl the hair on Freuds beard.A lot of this fixation for some reason centres on hummus defined by one character as ""a very tasty diarrhea-like substance."" That perfectly good foodstuff is put to revolting uses.Zohan also employs his mouth in ingenious ways in the hair salon - the standing joke of the movie is that Zohan provides sexual gratification as well as hairstyling to the elderly female clientele. A trick that he does with his mouth and hair conditioner makes me gag just to think about it.Sandlers job apart from pulling off these capers with aplomb is doing a song and dance with aspirates - part of his Middle Eastern accent - and to say things with doe-eyed sincerity such as ""You are special one. I will be only steef for you."" The object of his affections responds ""What is `steef?"" Zohan says something else funny in response to that but Ive forgotten what.The most interesting aspect of the movie is the message that the solution for ancient ethnic hatreds is for everybody to move to America and hustle.""Here in America were the same"" an Israeli immigrant says to a Palestinian. ""Were just people trying to get jobs."" A Palestinian terrorist signals his conversion to peace by confessing to Zohan that he really wants to be a shoe salesman. ""I love shoes"" he says in a thrilling whisper.Theres a lot to be said for consumerism as a salve for historic wounds. Of course theres also a drawback to our free market ways - we get shoes made in China and movies like You Dont Mess with the Zohan.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME You Dont Mess with the Zohans premise is so vivid and promising -- a legendary Israeli counter terrorist wants to give up violence and find his bliss as a hair stylist -- that it entered funny movie legend land months in advance of its release. Ideas like that dont occur every day in Hollywood. Or every year for that matter. Now at last our impatience is rewarded and I must say the result is a laff riot. Well all right a laff scuffle -- a picture that isnt quite as funny as it might be but is as funny as it needs to be. Agreeably directed by Dennis Dugan conceived by its star Adam Sandler and one-third written by him (his co-conspirators are Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow) the picture bears many of the latters trademark moves. That is to say it is simultaneously a little bit vulgar and a little bit sentimental and comes out as a virtually bullet-proof blend for the mass summertime audience. Very simply The Zohan fakes his own death at the hands of his arch-enemy The Phantom a Palestinian terrorist (a devoutly nasty John Turturro) ships himself to New York in an airplanes cargo hold which he shares with two dogs named Scrappy and Coco whom he puts to sleep with his non-stop monologue. The mutts provide him with a nom de stylist (Scrappy Coco). After landing a mild mannered young man named Michael (Nick Swardson) whom Zohan rescues from a snooty street bully (his habit is to literally tie bad guys into knots) provides him with a spare room. He also provides an older woman who just happens to be Michaels Mom (Lainie Kazan in lustful fettle) who cheerfully adopts Zohan as her boy toy much to her sons dismay. ""Cheerful"" is the operative word here. The sheer good nature of all concerned disarms the movies constant flirtations with bad taste. For example The Zohan gets a job in a rundown beauty parlor and rises from sweeping up the floor to creating sweeping hair-dos -- and incidentally to providing sexual services for its aging clientele. Its a variation on a gag that happily served Mel Brooks in The Producers and as in that enterprise the result is more innocent merriment than discomfort for the audience. But still...issues keep arising. For one thing Delia the shops proprietor and Zohans love interest is a Palestinian (the very attractive Emmanuelle Chriqui) and indeed the shop is located on a rundown street one side of which is occupied by Israeli shopkeepers while the other is rented out to Palestinians. They exist in uneasy yet potentially volatile harmony. They are however threatened by a greedy realtor whos raising their rents in order to drive them out so he can erect a neighborhood-busting shopping mall. Can love laughter and a common enemy solve -- at least locally -- the Arab-Israeli conflict? This movie seems to think so though genial humanism may strike you as a pretty slender hope for so titanic an issue. And its a big narrative lurch too which maybe we shouldnt dwell upon. Much better to focus on the purely comedic beginning with Sandlers performance. It offers hilarious satire on James Bondian heroics. And Zohans manic desire to provide ""silky smooth"" hair dressing represents good comic value too. Theres always been a sweet disconnectedness to Sandlers screen character and when it is married to his contrasting obsessive quest for a peaceful more or less conventional civilian life as it is here this slightly rickety movie bounces along very likeably. Its just out for a good slightly silly time. And against all common sense you find yourself rooting for these nice people hoping they find the modest happiness which is all they aspire to and which goofily they attain.

Starring Adam Sandler Emmanuelle Chriqui and John Turturro. Directed by Dennis Dugan. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Give credit to Adam Sandler for trying to find the funny bone in terrorism. If Ernst Lubitsch could make fun of Nazis in ""To Be or Not to Be"" (1942) and Charlie Chaplin could parody Hitler in ""The Great Dictator"" (1940) why shouldnt Sandler go for the brass ring in ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan?"" Whenever theres something people fear that they dont even want to think about thats an opportunity for comedy. Potentially. But Sandler isnt the one to exploit it. His screenplay co-written with Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow is too lazy and too scattered to balance silliness and insight. Serious intent may be lurking somewhere in there but its buried under layers of stupidity - not just stupid jokes which is what you want from Sandler but also stupid shallow thinking. Its important to distinguish between varieties of intentional stupidity when talking about Sandlers humor. The stupid jokes are good. Sandler plays an anti-terrorist agent in ""Zohan"" an Israeli who brushes his teeth with hummus and is so tough he does gravity-defying no-handed pushups. Those bits are funny because theyre shameless in an energetic way. The intentional stupidity becomes a problem when were talking about overall conception because there the shamelessness is the opposite of energetic. It becomes a form of complacency. Sandler is sloppy. He gets one idea - and doesnt try for a second one. He doesnt think things through. He tries to get by on charm glosses over plot holes with gross jokes and tries the audiences patience. As a result what might have been an ambitious effort becomes another lousy Sandler movie endless and tiresome with a handful of funny moments. No surprise ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" is at its best in the beginning - thats how it usually works with one-joke concepts. Hes an unstoppable terrorist-killing machine irresistible to the ladies but all he really wants is to be a hairstylist. So he fakes his own death and stows away from the Middle East to New York where he gets a job in a cut-rate downtown salon. Zohans commitment to hairstyling could have been an emotional peg on which to hang the comedy rather like Zoolanders commitment to modeling in ""Zoolander."" But no sooner does Zohan arrive in New York than the movie starts undermining that aspect of the character. Instead of becoming a talented (if crazily flamboyant) hairstylist Zohan becomes a guy renowned for having sex with his customers. And so we get scene after scene of Zohan flirting with and rubbing up against women in their 70s and 80s. That Sandler is tasteless and audacious isnt so bad. Whats bad is that he uses tastelessness as a lazy default. Whenever hes lost in a scene instead of finding his way he comes up with something intended to offend somebody (having sex with an old lady or repeatedly kicking a house cat). The goal is to get some people in the audience angry so that other audience members will feel flattered at the notion of their own hipness and tolerance. In truth the really offensive thing here is that Sandler thinks people are so mindless they wont see what hes up to or wont care that hes just throwing dust in their faces. And to think all this emptiness and sloppiness is stretched to almost two full hours. For an hour in the middle almost nothing happens except that various famous faces show up in cameos - Chris Rock Kevin Nealon Mariah Carey George Takei Sid Ganis John McEnroe. Every five or 10 minutes theres a mild laugh. Otherwise you can get in a good nap. Any celebrity would be flattered to appear briefly in an Adam Sandler movie. Its the unlucky celebrities who are called upon to do more such as John Turturro as the Palestinian terrorist whos not such a bad guy after all and Rob Schneider as a Middle Eastern cab driver still mourning the theft of his goat. If youre tempted to feel hostility toward them as they strenuously pursue laughs that arent there take a moment to think what they must have been going through. -- Advisory This film contains crude humor.

"You Dont Mess with the Zohan | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; you-don-t-mess-with-the-zohan ) You Dont Mess with the Zohan (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching You Dont Mess with the Zohan is a little like watching an episode of the TV show of which Adam Sandler is an alum Saturday Night Live. Zohan feels like an extended collection of skits tied together by a flimsy umbrella story. It features cameos by second-tier celebrities (George Takei John McEnroe) and has a musical ""guest"" (Mariah Carey). As is too often the case with todays SNL humor is at a premium a lot of supposedly ""clever"" material isnt remotely funny and the whole thing feels like it should be over a lot sooner than it is. The result is another flabby comedy that gets its biggest laughs from thinly-covered penises and bare buttocks. On some level Zohan wants viewers to believe its entering ""daring"" waters by its application of politically incorrect comedy to socio-political issues. (One wonders whether the filmmakers thought they were following in Borats footsteps.) So it lampoons various aspects of Judaism the Middle East conflict homosexuality (central to Sandlers previous outing I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry) and which wives of the current crop of Presidential candidates (or in one case the candidate herself) are ""bang-able."" The problem is that while this material may be outlandish and in questionable taste its not funny. Maybe theres a chuckle to be found in how many uses the characters find for hummus but like many of the jokes in Zohan this one is beaten until its far past the point of death. Sandler does this a lot here uncovers something amusing then repeatedly goes back to it until it has become tedious. In many ways thats a description of the production as a whole. Zohan (Sandler) is an Israeli James Bond who loves disco dancing and secretly dreams of moving to New York and becoming a hair stylist. Hes fed up of the never-ending Middle East conflict and just wants to live in peace where he can enjoy hummus and Fizzy Bubbly and make everyones hair silky smooth. A battle with his arch enemy The Phantom (John Turturro) allows Zohan to fake his own death. He then escapes to New York where he changes his look and name (now ""Scrappy Coco"") and goes to work for a Palestinian hairdresser named Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) whose accent is almost as bad as his. He graduates from unpaid sweeper to star stylist as his sensual manner of washing womens hair (followed by loud animal sex in a backroom) makes him a top attraction. The film also incorporates subplots about an egomaniacal land tycoon (Michael Buffer - although they should have gotten Donald Trump) and a romance between Zohan and Dalia. As directed by longtime Sandler cohort and frequent collaborator Dennis Dugan the movie opens with some energy but quickly descends into the doldrums. Once the film gets to New York it becomes repetitive and long-winded. The proceedings get an occasional jolt of energy when Zohan uses his superspy abilities to defeat criminals but there are too few instances of this. The movies middle section is primarily comprised of scenes of elderly women looking disheveled as they exit the back room where Zohan has taken them as a part of their ""hair styling."" The film pays so little attention to the attraction between Zohan and Dalia that the only reason it doesnt come as a complete surprise is because its a given in comedies like this that the lead man must fall in love with the hottest woman. Once Adam Sandler was known as one of the bad boys of comedy - an actor who typically played uncouth men in a state of arrested adolescent development and used those characteristics to comedic effect. These days Sandler wants to be liked so he occasionally essays serious roles and his alter-egos in comedies have lost their edge. Despite his willingness to couple with anything female and his Monty Python-esque accent Zohan is pretty boring. ""Pretty"" also applies to Emmanuelle Chriqui. Shes eye candy for the teenage boys who comprise Sandlers core audience. John Tuturro is underused and unfunny. Then theres Rob Schneider Sandlers buddy who once again proves that a one scene appearance is too much screen time - and here hes given a lot more than just one scene. His subplot about a terrorist taxi cab driver out to get Zohan is a complete dud and not only because Schneider fails to elicit a single laugh. Even die-hard Sandler lovers will likely acknowledge that their hero isnt firing on all cylinders here. We go to these movies to laugh at dumb crude things and while You Dont Mess with the Zohan offers plenty of crass stupid material not a lot of it is funny even on a base level. For every successful gag there are perhaps ten that dont work or that try so hard that they lose their appeal. As a ten-minute skit on Saturday Night Live You Dont Mess with the Zohan might have worked. As a two-hour movie it lacks the comedic energy to rise above a middling crowd of forgettable summer movies.

You Dont Mess With the Zohan. (PG-13) Columbia (112 min.) Directed by Dennis Dugan. With Adam Sandler. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS At the start of the decade Adam Sandler had an idea for a film a wacky comedy about an Israeli secret agent fighting off Arab terrorists. Then 9/11 happened. Suddenly not so funny. But no good idea -- or bad one -- ever goes unused in Hollywood. And so its finally time for his Oy-Oy-7 satire now revamped and titled ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan."" And its still not so funny. Its not just that its offensive -- which it is mildly. The Israeli men are all seen as sharpie businessmen who spend their days eating hummus and seducing every woman of any age they see; the Arab men are simply violent terrorists. (Sandler is violent too of course but despite all his Uzis he prefers ""Matrix""-style martial arts; when Palestinian children throw rocks at him he sculpts the stones into a toy.) But thats not the real problem with the film. The problem is its not very funny. The script co-written by comedy-factory Judd Apatow goes on too long (like all his scripts) and is dirty without being clever. The direction by Dennis Dugan is flabby and dull -- like most of the hacks-for-hire who end up bringing a Sandler opus to the screen and whose chief qualification seems to be the ability to shout ""Great Adam Great"" The movie may be about terrorism but were the ones held hostage. The film begins in Tel Aviv where Sandlers Zohan is a crack secret agent always called in for the impossible missions. But hes tired of being a spy. What he really wants to be is a Manhattan hairdresser. (At which point of course the ""swish"" jokes begin.) And so outdated Paul Mitchell book in tow he smuggles himself into New York where he gets a job at a tiny neighborhood hair salon. Owned of course by a beautiful Palestinian. You could plot the rest of the movie yourself and I wish you would -- it couldnt be more meandering than the script they used which somehow manages to drag in skinheads vengeful Arabs a Hacky Sack competition Mariah Carey a greedy developer and constant scenes of Zohan having sex with his elderly customers. I dont want to give too much away but I can report Ive now seen Adam Sandler talking dirty to Charlotte Rae of ""The Facts of Life."" I may have to rinse my ears out with bleach. Although most of the jokes arent funny there are plenty of them and die-hard Sandler fans may enjoy seeing him running around in a feathered haircut doing his best disco moves. (Why the movie seems to have decided that Israel is stuck permanently in 1987 is never sufficiently explained.) The movie also -- and this is the first time since ""Gigli"" I believe -- provides Lainie Kazan with a nude scene. Wasnt this outlawed as part of the Oslo agreements? Clearly time has passed since 9/11; the movies have gone from ignoring the event entirely to treating the war on terror seriously to searching for humor in stereotypes (""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" ""Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden"" ""War Inc."" ""Postal."") Wrestling with the topic is a start I suppose. But theres one thing these comedians have still forgotten to do. Write some jokes. Rating note The film contains comic violence constant vulgarity sexual situations and Lainie Kazans tuchis. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

That he seems more believable getting jiggy with Lainie Kazan Charlotte Rae and assorted other 70- and 80-something actresses than with his gorgeous leading lady is something that perhaps only Sandlers therapist can explain. Maybe next he can star in a remake of ""Portnoys Complaint."" Sandler looks uncharacteristically buff - though that may be one of the movies many cheesy special effects - in the proudly Jewish stars twisted salute to Israels 60th birthday his crudest comedy since the cruelly underrated ""Little Nicky"" the new films ludicrous PG-13 rating notwithstanding. The fish-out-of-water story written by a committee including Sandler and Judd Apatow is little more than a protracted ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch. Tired of matching wits with a Palestinian terrorist called the Phantom (John Turturro raising funds for his next directing gig) Sandlers Zohan fakes his own death and turns up in Brooklyn - a Paul Mitchell stylebook from the 80s in hand - as Scrappy Coco aspiring hairdresser. He lands on the Sony backlot version of Atlantic Avenue where an employee at an electronic store called Going Out of Business recognizes him as Zohan and steers Scrappy to a job at a struggling salon run by a Palestinian knockout (the charming Emmanuelle Chriqui). All goes fairly well until a dimwitted Palestinian cab driver (a cringe-worthy Rob Schneider) who also recognizes Zohan tips off the Phantom after unsuccessfully trying to bomb the salon using . . . Neosporin. How much you like this will depend upon your appreciation for repeated jokes about hummus gays Zohans crotch (as overstuffed as a Stage Deli sandwich) and his fondness for older women (Sandler regular Nick Swardson plays Kazans nauseated son). Plus a parade of celebrity cameos from the likes of Henry Winkler Mariah Carey and George Takei. Directed with sledgehammer subtlety by Dennis Dugan (""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry"") ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" throws in a brotherhood plea thats about as convincing as Sandlers Israeli accent which wavers over three continents. lou.lumenicknypost.com YOU DONT MESS WITH THE ZOHAN Teenage boy ""Shampoo.""Running time 113 minutes.

(Corkery/News) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 5 2008 550 PM Its weird to think that Adam Sandler is too good for ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" since at first glance the new comedy doesnt seem far from his other goofball hits of the last dozen years. But in that time the megastar man-child has shown growth and branched out.Theres certainly growth in ""Zohan"" notably in using as a backdrop the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - not usually the source of a whole lotta laughs. But what works best in this gross-out fest actually is its innocent politics a richer source of jokes it turns out than Sandlers super Mossad agent Zohan wanting to become a hairdresser. No one gets hurt with hair as Zohan says to his parents when explaining why he wants to retire from the states Special Ops team what with the killing and the retaliation and the endless fights with the Phantom (John Turturro) a Hezbollah terrorist star. So Zohan fakes his own death and spirits himself to New York where he finds a Jewish mother (Lainie Kazan) he can really love a place where Arabs and Israelis can live together and a job cutting ladies hair. Zohan has a passion for the coifs of the 80s and likes to get passionate with clients who actually are 80. His love-em-and-shampoo-em-style saves his salon from a greedy developer. But when the Phantom gets word of his enemys resurrection Zohan must stop disco-dancing - and wooing his Palestinian boss (Emmanuelle Chriqui) - and find himself a permanent peace. Just as Sandlers most memorable stuff builds on his just-under-the-surface anger ""Zohans"" better bits have dark roots The accessibility of bomb-making material ethnic cliches violent bigots - all are fodder for smirk-worthy shtick. Even the ever-intense Turturro gets a chance to be silly which hes great at and only Sandler and the Coen brothers have fully utilized. But a little of Sandlers funny voices goes a long way and his ""Yez iz Zohan"" suave-guy baritone gets old fast. Like other ""Saturday Night Live"" alums of his era Sandler has an affection for over-the-top characters that would work best in a short sketch. Director Dennis Dugan an overgrown kid himself is no help despite having guided Sandler to winning turns in ""Happy Gilmore"" and ""Big Daddy."" Those comedies showed Sandler refining his persona as did ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates"" and he gave effective dramatic performances in ""Punch-Drunk Love"" and last years ""Reign Over Me."" His humor works best when its throw-away but ""Zohan"" throws everything up to get a yuck. Its a shock to see how many ""yuck"" moments Sandler settles for.

Sprung from the fertile comic imaginations of Robert Smigel (""Triumph the Insult Comic Dog"") and Judd Apatow (the grand vizier of film comedy) it exists in a slap-happy parallel universe. In ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" Israeli commandos dream of styling mousse and blow driers hummus is a dip served with eyeglasses and Mariah Carey asks terrorists to explain Bluetooth technology. Zohan is a top Israeli counterspy who bops down the boulevard like Borat imitating a disco-era Travolta snapping Chuck Norris moves. He is the master of almost any situation from a hacky sack challenge to outswimming a jihadist on a jet ski. He leaps across rooftops with an agility that would make Spider-Man weep and he never overcooks grilled fish. He is also a sex god (Sandler buffed to perfection sports a codpiece the size of a cantaloupe). His greatest drawback is his consonant-gargling accent which sounds like a collection of Scrabble tiles swirled in a blender. But Zohan is unfulfilled. He dreams of leaving the endless conflict of the Middle East for a peaceful life as a New York hairdresser. While pursuing the extra-dastardly-evil terrorist known as the Phantom (John Turturro) he fakes his own death stows away on a transatlantic jet and wrangles an entry-level job at a rundown salon his new mission in life to make the world ""silky smooth."" Hes great with a clipper and comb but Zohans real appeal is the additional services he gives his elderly clients in the stockroom love pad. As in last years ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"" homosexual anxiety underpins many of the films jokes. This time its turned inside out Rather than a red-blooded firefighter pretending to be gay Sandlers now a lady-killer stud in a gay mans profession. Zohan is a macho dynamo Hes so exuberantly proud of his body that he cant help doing a bump and grind with every rinse and fluff and it must be said that Sandlers campy body language is hilarious. Naturally the Happy Madison films stock company is on hand with extended cameos. Rob Schneider pops up as an Arab taxi driver who recognizes Zohan and endangers his new life Kevin Nealon appears as a timid neighborhood watch captain and Nick Swardson plays a nerd whos appalled by Zohans nonstop lovemaking with his mommie dearest (Lainie Kazan). John McEnroe George Takai and Bruce Vilanch show up just for the hell of it. Full marks go to longtime Sandler collaborator Dennis Dugan (of ""Chuck amp; Larry"" and ""The Benchwarmers"") whose direction has never been better. The film has a disorienting daffy feel swinging easily between the comic romance of Zohan and the pretty Palestinian owner of his salon (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and farcical action scenes that demolish half of Brooklyn. The dialogue is full of left-field weirdness When Zohan explains his accent by insisting hes Australian someone comments that its much nicer there since they ended apartheid. YOU DONT MESS WITH THE ZOHAN  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language and nudity. And for fans of physical humor Sandler performs impossible deeds of athletic prowess with the aid of computer animation and prosthetic feet. (Dont ask.) Best of all his characters accent keeps Sandler from drifting into the adenoidal whine that made many of his characters physically painful to listen to. ""Zohan"" tries for a message of social relevance with a nod to America as the land of multicultural coexistence but its real value is in air-fluffing our cares away for a couple of hours.

The film is directed by Dennis Dugan written by Adam Sandler amp; Robert Smigel amp; Judd Apatow and produced by Adam Sandler and Jack Giarraputo. The release date is June 6 2008.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Evidently theres something even harder to pull off than Middle Eastern peace a steady run of jokes that deserve our laughter -- if ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" is an indicator. In this PG-13 comedy that teases the Palestinian-Israeli conflict Adam Sandler plays Zohan Dvir. A bearded wild-haired Israeli with a hunger for hummus Zohan is the states best counter-terrorist. Hes so gifted hes choppered from his vacation to lead a precision strike against the Phantom (John Turturro.) As Zohan reminds his superiors too willing to exact collateral damage ""he can get it done without the mess."" Hes not the sort of guy to harbor a fugitive desire to be a hairstylist. Or is he? When Zohan shares this wish with his parents they are less than supportive. The film shrugs off the Yiddish epithet for gay as a joke on Zohans parents and those who cant imagine a straight-male hairdresser. (Havent they ever seen Warren Beatty in ""Shampoo""?) Fed up with conflict Zohan fakes his death and heads for the land of milk-and-honey conditioners Paul Mitchells salon in Manhattan. Written by Sandler Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow ""Zohan"" is a set-up that might have sustained a Saturday Night Live sketch. Barely. Here it runs broad and padded not unlike Zohans nether regions. A better comedy would invite grad school theses about American Jewish fantasies for Israel. At the heart of this not entirely cynical but powerfully lazy comedy is a wish for peace. Or as Zohan likes to say a hope for ""silky smooth"" coexistence. Indeed theres something nearly touching in making Zohan so ridiculously skilled. He can do no-handed push-ups. He remakes the stones Palestinian children hurl at him into party favors. He wears a codpiece that suggests an endowment to match these outsized talents. After a bumpy start in New York Zohan earns his stylist station at a salon in a neighborhood that is home to Palestinian and Israeli immigrants. In a weak subplot a real-estate developer jacks up the rents on the salons grocery stores and the glut of Israeli-owned electronics stores. Zohans skills with the scissors but mostly the AARP card-carrying ladies that are his customers keeps proprietor Dalias salon afloat. The role of the Palestinian immigrant Dalia requires Emmanuelle Chriqui to look lovely (easy enough) and also hold fast a demeanor that registers incredulity at Zohans antics while maintaining the possibility of fondness (not as easy). If youre itching for an amusing flick about the Israeli-Palenstinian conflict seek out Ari Sandels ""West Bank Story."" The 21-minute take-off on ""West Side Story"" featuring dueling falafel stands and a pair hummus-crossed lovers won 2006s Oscar for best short. (""A Collection of 2006 Academy Award Nominated Short Films"" DVD; 29.98). The greatest offense isnt the outlandish depictions of Israelis and Palenstinians (though Turturro and Rob Schneider cast as foes suggest it wasnt an easy sell to Arab actors). Its that a film this stupid about something so vital -- even to its makers -- will open on thousands of screens likely do well opening weekend and in so doing greenlight more vanity projects. ""You Dont Mess with the Zohan"" PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language and nudity. 1 hour 53 minutes. Directed by Dennis Dugan; written by Adam Sandler Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow; photography by Michael Barrett; starring Adam Sandler John Turturro Emmanuelle Chirqui Nick Swardson Lainie Kazan Rob Schneider.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 7 2008 Save for later Saved As high concepts go ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" takes the cake Adam Sandler plays an Israeli commando who pursues his dream of becoming a hairstylist in New York. Could the film possibly be as funny as its trailer?Not exactly. ""Zohan"" coasts on its premise far more often than it fulfills it. But these days you take your laughs where you find them. Its a pretty good scattershot comedy.Sandler came up with the idea of the Zohan character and then with his co-writers Robert Smigel and the omnipresent Judd Apatow worked it up into what amounts to a glorified ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch stretched to almost two hours. (Question Why are current comedies so much longer than they need to be? ""Sex and the City"" was almost 2-1/2 hours) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Zohan Dvir Israels most famous counterterrorist resembles a hairy bizarro cross between James Bond Spider-Man Borat and Brad Pitt. When called upon to eliminate his nemesis the bling-festooned Palestinian terrorist Phantom (a hilarious John Turturro) he uses the occasion to fake his own death. Stowing away on a plane bound for the promised land of Manhattan he clutches his bible - his hallowed 1987 Paul Mitchell style book. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review You Dont Mess With the Zohan Zohan wants to make the world ""silky smooth"" but his stylings are so outdated that he can only find work in a salon catering to old ladies. Its owner is the beautiful Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) a Palestinian who doesnt quite buy Zohans cover story about being Australian. For one thing he loves hummus too much. (This movie finds more uses for hummus than you can possibly imagine some of them unprintable all of them funny.)Zohan becomes the star of the salon not only because of his dos - he also throws in some extracurricular ""activities"" for the clientele and soon ladies of a certain age are lining up around the block. A little of this gonzo humor goes a long way especially since it only seems to be in the movie to demonstrate that Zohan is emphatically not gay. Didnt Warren Beattys turn in ""Shampoo"" count for anything?Much better is the way ""Zohan"" stirs the melting pot. The Manhattan of this movie is a multiethnic carnival where old world and new world are constantly intermixing. A Palestinian cab driver (Rob Schneider) does double duty from his taxi as a phone salesman for the Spiegel catalog. An Israeli electronics salesman (Ido Mosseri) haggles with his landlord about rent as if he were bartering in a flea market. Director Dennis Dugans fondness for these cultural collisions dampens the inherent iffiness of the material. This is after all a comedy featuring the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as its centerpiece and terrorism as its mainstay.Some of the dampening comes across as just plain mushy. When one of the characters in his best ""West Side Story"" mode announces that ""Here in America were the same we live together"" the nobility of the sentiment is essentially just a cover for the filmmakers bad taste. And how do the Palestinians and Israelis finally bond in ""Zohan""? By decimating neo-Nazis of course. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.Theres an alternate bonding ritual in ""Zohan"" that I much prefer. Both sides are gaga for Mariah Carey (who makes an addled appearance). Does the State Department know about this? Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language and nudity.)

Comments You Dont Mess With the Zohan A battle-fatigued Israeli commando gives himself a makeover assuming a new identity as a New York hairstylist. Thats more high-concept than most Adam Sandler comedies with the star creating a distinctive character amid all the meshugas. Though a bunch of the jokes are milked too thin there are some absurdly goofy sight gags--like a hacky sack game enlisting a family pet--and a lineup of fun silly cameos by guests from Chris Rock to Mariah Carey. John Turturro and Rob Schneider play the heros inept Arab nemeses but skinheads and greedy tycoons are the ones who really get bashed in this lightweight amiable parody. Sandler cowrote the screenplay with Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow and Dennis Dugan directed. PG-13 113 min.

Tracy Bennett/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Tracy Bennett/Columbia Pictures Defensive posture Adam Sandlers Zohan assumes the position. Tracy Bennett/Columbia Pictures You Dont Mess with the Zohan Director Dennis DuganGenre ComedyRunning Time 100 minutes Clips from the Zohan Danger at the Kiddie Salon You Have Never Cut Hair? Among the reliable hazards of summer -- sunburn heatstroke mosquitoes -- we should probably include Adam Sandler comedies. They arrive heralded by posters bearing little more than a title and the stars goofy visage; they take in millions in inverse proportion to the wit of their scripts and then retire quickly to video-store shelves. This years entry You Dont Mess with the Zohan has a hot topic -- Israeli-Palestinian tension -- to match the hot weather but its otherwise constructed to a slapsticky formula. Sandler plays Zohan a Mossad agent and ladies man (cue the padded-crotch jokes) whos grown tired of assassination-planning and bullet-dodging in the Middle East (cue the hummus jokes) and grown fond of hairdressing (cue the feygeleh jokes). So he fakes his death and relocates to an Israeli emigre community in New York City (cue the discount-appliance jokes) where he finds a gig as a stylist to randy old ladies (cue the ""special back-room services"" jokes). And on the way to a cant-we-all-please-just-get-along finale he falls for a gorgeous babe of Arab descent (Entourages Emmanuelle Chriqui). As scripted by Sandler Robert Smigel and the recently ubiquitous Judd Apatow everything is sufficiently cartoonish -- Zohan can catch speeding bullets (at one point with a nostril) and cook fish with his derriere (dont ask) -- that its probably pointless to get too worked up over the offensive stereotypes the film trades in. The film is at least an equal-opportunity offender with homophobic skinheads crashing gay parties Muslim extremists opening fast-food falafel joints and Jewish households so garish the wallpaper might make your eyes bleed. Whats more annoying than the crassness really is the directorial sloppiness that results in a virtually mirthless first half-hour and a slow build to chuckles thereafter. Sandler saddled here with an accent that proves annoying before the film is 10 minutes old can be a decent actor when a project requires it. (Witness Paul Thomas Andersons Punch Drunk Love.) But Dennis Dugan the auteur behind last summers I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry isnt the director to pull nuance out of his star. And with Sandler also co-writing and co-producing its hard to know who else might have said ""Hey folks this could really be smarter if we tried a little."" You dont mess with the Sandler presumably.

The tasty chickpea paste is the favorite foodstuff of the Zohan the commando who dreams secretly of comb-outs. Zohan (Adam Sandler with a credible Israeli accent) is the Jewish James Bond who snacks on hummus brushes his teeth with it uses it to tame the frizzies - and also to spackle the gaping plotholes of the unruly hank of slapstick You Dont Mess With the Zohan. Wielding Uzi and blow-dryer with equal ease Zohan is a macho boytoy who resembles the spawn of Eric Banas muscular Mossad agent in Munich and Warren Beattys hairstylist/womanizer in Shampoo. Given the Zohans shaggy locks and biblical beard it isnt readily apparent that hair care is an obsession with the Jewish James Bond. The counterspy with the martial-arts skills of Jackie Chan the swagger of Daniel Craig and the surprise package of John Holmes wants to opt out of the endless eye-for-an-eye with his Palestinian adversary the Phantom (John Turturro). How many times can they play ping-pong with hand grenades hacky-sack with scimitars? Tired of the unending fight between Arab and Jew the Zohan fakes his own death and stows away to America where he hopes to transform himself - and client hair - from harsh and coarse into ""silky smooth."" In America Zohan favors unbuttoned disco shirts and stonewashed jeans so tight that his Gaza Strip looks like Mount Sinai. Inevitably he falls for a fetching Palestinian Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) who operates the downtown salon where he finds a job and also finds that immigrant Arabs and Jews are more alike than not. In the Middle East Arab and Jew are adversaries. In America they share a common enemy racists. While Zohan purveys the familiar Sandler mix of Jewvenile humor and geriatric love (Zohan does biddy hair then does them) its less about a manic manchild than it is a raunchily wholesome message movie that deploys stereotypes in order to smash them. In other words less like The Waterboy and more like I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry only funny. (Sandler the consummate film politician makes movies to please multiple constituencies.) In the amiably messy screenplay written by Sandler Robert Smigel and the ubiquitous Judd Apatow Jews and Arabs both are cunning merchants with specialized niches respectively electronics stores and newsstands. As it exploits ethnic stereotypes - dim Arab bombmakers who dont know the difference between nitroglycerine and Neosporin wily Jewish salesmen who bait and switch their customers - Zohan wrings groans and giggles. The sight of Sandler regular Rob Schneider as a Palestinian cabbie who phones the Hezbollah hotline produces both. Salaam aleikum shalom aleichem and out. You Dont Mess With the Zohan 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Dennis Dugan. With Adam Sandler Emmanuelle Chriqui John Turturro Lainie Kazan and Rob Schneider. Distributed by Sony Pictures.

But there is this one unexpected aspect - several scenes are laugh-out-loud funny. How did that happen? One suspects that having former Sandler roommate Judd Apatow as one of Sandlers co-writers (Robert Smigel is the other) has a lot to do with it. Zohan doesnt come close to measuring up to even a weaker Apatow effort like Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story but at least it has some laughs. Granted almost all of them are of the Im-ashamed-but-cant-help-myself variety. But theyre there nevertheless. Sandler stars as Zohan a Mossad superagent. In fact as the opening scene establishes hes basically an Israeli superhero able to catch bullets with his nose disable teams of men by himself and play hacky sack with his rear end. His naked rear end of which we see plenty. Must be the Apatow touch. But Zohan is unfulfilled because inside this killing machine beats the heart of a hairstylist. Armed with a woefully outdated Paul Mitchell style book he wants to move to New York and make the world ""silky smooth."" So while engaged in combat with sworn enemy the Phantom (John Turturro) he fakes his death steals away aboard a plane and winds up in New York where he finds chasing his dream a little more difficult than he expected. And he cant completely outrun his past. Zohan comes to the aid of Michael (Nick Swardson); soon hes living in the apartment Michael shares with his mother Gail (Lainie Kazan). And a running joke is born Zohan repays Gails generosity by having sex with her often. The joke is in Michaels reaction - hes increasingly mortified (and increasingly funny). Sex is a big part of Zohans life. He can find work only in a salon owned by Dalia (Emmanuelle Chriqui) who is Palestinian and unaware of his former life. Dalia wont let him cut hair for a while but when she finally relents his customers are older women who enjoy the attention he lavishes on them. Some of the attention is paid in a back room after their hair is done. And so it goes. You laugh you feel bad about it you resolve not to laugh again you fail and bust a gut. The bit where Israeli and Palestinian immigrants talk about the relative sexual merits of various presidential candidates spouses (and Hillary Clinton of course) is degrading naturally - including the line that toasts John McCain. Bad taste? Oh yeah. Funny? You bet. We have reached the point that we always must in a review of a Sandler movie How much Rob Schneider do we get? Alas a lot. He plays Salim a taxi driver who had a run-in with Zohan years ago and recognizes him in New York. Another running joke Hummus. Why? Who knows? Its funny for a while but it gets old. The same is true of the film. Even the funny bits go on a tad long (no surprise given the Saturday Night Live pedigree of so much of the cast). There are some inspired cameos - Chris Rock as a cab driver John McEnroe as himself George Takei as himself and so on. The romance - well spare you just how Zohan knows he has fallen for Dalia but Gails take on it is the funniest line in the movie - is as unbelievable as anything else in the movie particularly the novel approach to finding peace in the Middle East or at least in Zohans little transplanted corner of it. Chriqui is a good sport though even if she isnt given much to do. So too is Swardson whos great as the horrified son. But it says something generally about the acting when Mariah Carey playing herself is as good or better than just about everyone else. No matter. Sandler films come with a built-in fan base an audience of true believers who find everything the guy does hilarious. Theyll find a lot to laugh at in You Dont Mess With the Zohan and unlike the unconverted wont be burdened with guilt afterwards.

Using the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a backdrop doesnt come close to capturing the surreal mix of cartoonish comedy ""Give peace a chance"" platitudes puzzling cameos and big-penis jokes that add up to not much in Adam Sandlers latest outing as star/producer/co-writer. The off-the-wall comedy of Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow leaves a mark on the script but it would require a talent of Peter Sellers magnitude to conquer this material and hes not around. Box office should be initially brisk courtesy of the Sandler faithful but beyond that ""Zohan"" is a mess and then some. The movie represents Sandlers fourth collaboration with director Dennis Dugan who has seemingly stayed within the comics orbit (from ""Big Daddy"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" to the more recent ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry"") by directing the star and his posse sparingly bordering on not at all. As evidence look no further than Rob Schneiders turn as a Palestinian cab driver with a lingering grudge against the title character -- his most relentlessly unfunny appearance under heavy makeup since his uncredited role in ""Chuck amp; Larry"" as an Asian wedding coordinator. Questions of insensitivity toward Arabs -- played as most of them are by non-Arabs -- will surely arise though the pics tone is so over the top as to somewhat diminish the impact. The take-away message moreover is a rather childlike plea for Arabs and Israelis to all just get along with the real bad guy being an evil U.S. real-estate developer played (incongruously along with much else in the film) by ring announcer Michael Buffer. Sandler buffed up for the part of Zohan a near-indestructible Israeli super-spy but theres still heavy use of body doubles during his early exploits in which he pursues a diabolical Palestinian terrorist the Phantom (John Turturro). In the midst of a grenade-batting exchange Zohan fakes his own death so he can flee to America and pursue his true passion -- cutting and styling hair. Landing in New York Zohan struggles to find work. Disappointed in his dream of working at Paul Mitchells salon he finally gets his chance from a Palestinian salon owner (""Entourages"" Emmanuelle Chriqui) in an ethnic neighborhood where Israeli electronics stores (with names like ""Going Out of Business"") uneasily coexist with Palestinian-owned shops. Zohans barbering career provides the movies one truly funny -- albeit wildly broad -- section as he earns a loyal clientele among elderly women by servicing them in a variety of ways. Its worth noting that in this year of copious male nudity ""Dont Mess With the Zohan"" garners a friendly PG-13 rating despite innumerable gags about Zohans enormous package which is conspicuous even when sheathed. In terms of actual laughs though the movie itself is pretty flaccid experiencing too many long arid stretches resembling Zohans home turf. Burdened with a premise better suited to a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch -- the bad-ass spy who really wants to be a stylist -- the writers pad things out by recycling bits about hummus immigrant Israeli and Arabs fondness for bargaining and randy old women. Alas those efforts and a decibel level bordering on abusive cant obscure the lack of originality and pacing. Several comedy and celebrity figures drop in along the way but none are given much to do. As for Sandler his phlegmy Israeli accent is fleetingly amusing but like most everything else grows tedious long before ""Zohan"" reaches its merciful end. Chriqui in fact plays perhaps the one character to emerge unscathed and given the predominantly young-male audience and her flattering wardrobe should at minimum bolster her position on Maxim-type ""hot"" lists. Whatever controversy the theme engenders (and its hard to imagine Arab-American advocacy groups not howling a little) ""Zohan"" is too silly to justify genuine anger. The more pressing thought as the movie drags on rather is an amended version of Buffers signature boxing bellow as in ""Lets get ready to exit"" You Dont Mess With the ZohanProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation in association with Relativity Media of a Happy Madison production.

The constantly surprising sketch brimmed with anarchic references to Psycho mother-and-son psychology cross-dressing 1930s movie musicals featuring manly Nelson Eddy as a crooning Royal Canadian Mountie British on-the-surface propriety and conservatism British beneath-the-surface kinkiness and the increasing presence of sexual content on television in the swinging 1960s -- all in a fluid seven minutes. I mention this because in You Dont Mess With the Zohan Adam Sandler plays an elite Israeli commando whos sick of combat and dreams of becoming a New York hairstylist -- a hairstylist who dresses in polyester disco shirts and tight pants that emphasize his papaya-size package. And although there is an onslaught of sexual content and a parade of guest stars in cameos the essential conservatism of the project guarantees that there are absolutely no surprises in a padded 112 minutes. (Okay one surprise Mariah Carey has a funny line promoting her own conservative musical product.) There is instead about enough novelty to fill a seven-minute sketch most of it relating to the sweetness with which Sandler initially presents himself as a curly-haired hyper-macho Israeli super-Jew. This proudly Semitic James Bond is good to his parents (Shelley Berman plays Zohans papa like a pussycat compared with the kibitzing the old pro gave Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm) good to the tawny bikinied Tel Aviv girls who flirt with him good to his Israeli comrades and even good to the little Arab kids whose villages hes sometimes forced to disrupt on the hunt for terrorists. Everything he loves about his country is summed up in his love of hummus; he even brushes his teeth with the stuff. There are at least as many hummus visual jokes in this movie as there were ancient tribes in Israel. As a Hebraic he-man Sandler is a menschy charmer all the more so for being so casually confidently post-political about the role; its a sexy adult look for the guy who also musters an excellent accent and does a nice bit catching bullets in his teeth. But once Zohan fakes his death and escapes to America rather than track down the Palestinian terrorist known as the Phantom (John Turturro a reliable Every-ethnic) the comedy gets old just as the action shifts to the new world. (The movie is co-written by Sandler SNLs Robert Smigel and the ubiquitous Judd Apatow and directed by Happy Gilmores Dennis Dugan.) Stowed away in an airplane cargo hold with two doggies in transit Zohan takes the combined names of his canine fellow travelers and emerges at JFK restyled as would-be hairdresser Scrappy Coco. His tonsorial references have never progressed beyond those in a 1987 hair-fashion book he clutches like a precious bible. But thats not all that hasnt progressed Scrappy is a typically tediously innocent Sandler man-child when it comes to sex. Hes got the bulge but not the brains. I know I know were not supposed to care about such persnickety niceties in such a cavalcade. But holy Koran and Torah both do we need to swallow still more nervous jokes about being mistaken for a homosexual after the ""enlightened"" groaners of I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry? Landed in melting-pot New York and hooked up with a job at a salon owned by a comely Palestinian cutie destined to become his love interest (Entourages Emmanuelle Chriqui) Zohan/ Scrappy reveals his talent for satisfying the sexual desires of his older women clients. And most of the heterosexual laughs are had at the sight of their aging lust (more rhino than cougar) for his equipment (more toe-curling than hair-curling). Then Rob Schneider arrives -- hes the comedy tax in any Adam Sandler production -- as an aggrieved Palestinian taxi driver who IDs Zohan and rallies his fellow Arabs to rumble. Thats when the movie falls into a muck of lessons about shalom as bland as any underseasoned bowl of chickpea dip. Gone is any real Arab-Israeli pertinence. Instead these New York-based Middle Easterners join forces against a last-act bogeyman an urban developer (Michael Buffer) whos cartoonishly villainous in his plans for neighborhood domination. Forget Monty Python You Dont Mess With the Zohan is a circus that never really flies.
