This routine slice of warm-weather entertainment about an FBI agent who poses as a 300-pound Southern granny in order to catch the bad guy could have been funnier and considerably better made. A drag comedy laced with numerous low-comedy set pieces ""Big Mommas House"" sees Martin Lawrence follow his former co-star Eddie Murphy into the salon for a heavy prosthetic makeover. This routine slice of warm-weather entertainment about an FBI agent who poses as a 300-pound Southern granny in order to catch the bad guy could have been funnier and considerably better made. But the evidence of everything from ""Charleys Aunt"" and ""Some Like It Hot"" to ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" indicates that you should never underestimate the appeal of a popular star dressed up in womens clothes for comic effect so strong returns in wide early summer play look likely. Skirting by with a PG-13 rating despite constant use of the s-word scatological farce and even a nude scene featuring the ""real"" Big Momma pic will probably be most enjoyed by teens and even preteens not already jaded by loads of R-rated sexcapades plus general audiences looking for ""Nutty Professor""-like good times. And while the quality of the Murphy film is never equaled there are lowdown laughs to be had from such sights as Lawrences street-wise officer trying to keep his disguise intact with an emergency application of duct tape scratching his bum under his billowing flowered dress and rearranging a melon-size falsie that goes astray. This is a situation comedy with the emphasis on situation When a murderous bank robber escapes from prison FBI man Malcolm Turner (Lawrence) and partner John (Paul Giamatti) lie in wait for him across the street from the Georgia home of the grandmother of the criminals former girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) whos headed there for a visit with her young son. When Big Momma takes off for a while Malcolm hurriedly steps in to assume the guise of the grand old gal a sassy lovably no-nonsense matriarch whose girth and bearing equal those of Hattie McDaniel. Farcically far-fetched solution to a law enforcement challenge forces Malcolm to pass himself off as the real thing for days not only to Sherry who fortuitously hasnt seen her granny in a couple of years but to her many old friends in town. And while Malcolms status as a master of disguise has been established in pics opening scene he still needs John working feverishly upstairs on new and improved padding and phony fat limbs so he can sustain his ruse until the outlaw arrives to reunite with Sherry. Given that the criminal Lester (Terrence Howard) doesnt show up in town until well over an hour in theres precious little investigating these feds can do and therefore hardly any plot. Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymers script is basically a premise to be filled with sketchlike comic set pieces only a few of which come near fulfilling their humorous potential. Among these scenes Malcolm hides and mugs behind a shower curtain while the real Big Momma (Ella Mitchell) noisily relieves herself on the toilet then strips to enter the tub (gross but fairly funny); Malcolm in his first attempt to pass himself off as Big Momma desperately tries to cook a good down-home meal for Sherry and son (pretty lame); ""Big Momma"" is paged to serve as midwife at a childbirth (boisterous at least); ""Big Momma"" in a karate class for oldsters beats up the instructor (a predictable but welcome release); ""Big Momma"" and Sherrys son defeat two playground hotshots at basketball in a contest that ends with you-know-who executing a brilliant slam dunk (not as amusing as the equivalent scene in ""Romeo Must Die""); the luscious Sherry cuddles with ""Big Momma"" in bed only to be startled by something poking her under the covers (inevitable but fun anyway); and ""Big Momma"" is called upon to testify at a raucous church gathering resulting in her leading a chorus of ""Oh Happy Day"" (rousing). But while the effectiveness of these sequences is variable the sight and sound of Lawrence in fat-lady drag remains engaging throughout; script may often let him down forcing him to keep things afloat almost single-handedly but hes adept enough to pull off all but the thinnest interludes. Thanks to the extremely effective special makeup created by Greg Cannom (who shared Oscars for ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and ""Dracula"" and most recently transformed Robin Williams for ""Bicentennial Man"") and Captive Audience the actors looks and personality show through all the silicone rubber and makeup and the difference between his Big Momma and the real one is noticeable but subtle enough to allow the viewer to accept the charade. This proves especially helpful in the frantic finale when both Lester and the real grandmother show up at the latters house in the midst of a surprise party. For a time the two Mommas are both running around the house without meeting but confounding guests at how quickly she is able to change clothes. Malcolms ultimate unmasking saves the day of course but also appalls Sherry who the agent has courted in his few nondrag moments. No great ""Some Like It Hot"" capper to this dilemma but rather a Capraesque mea culpa scene in church that does the trick. Long is sweet and comely as the object of Malcolms frustrated desire while the remainder of the perfs are as broad as the day is long; seemingly having the most fun is Carl Wright as Big Mommas perpetually horny old beau. Director Raja Gosnell goes for the obvious target every time and the law of averages allows him to hit it every so often. Aside from the makeup work production values are on the skimpy side with studioish interiors and Southern California locations not convincing as Deep South substitutes. Soundtrack is crammed to overflowing with hip-hop and funk tunes that are collectively too abrasive and intrusive for a comedy.

Starring Martin Lawrence. Directed by Raja Gosnell. (VHS. Rated PG-13. 95 minutes.) Inside every big momma there is a skinny little guy trying to get out. Its Martin Lawrence in this particular case. In ""Big Mommas House"" he doesnt play Big Momma. He impersonates her and before the show was over I was very fond of the old gal. There are two Big Mommas. One is the salty character played by actress Ella Mitchell who occupies a Georgia house where there is a secret FBI stakeout. The second one is Lawrence himself as the FBI agent who takes over her life when she is called away on an emergency. When the audience sees right off the bat Mitchells formidable rolling gait and guesses whats coming the question on everybodys mind is Can Lawrence imitate her? Not exactly and thats the beauty part. The audience is in on the joke. Lawrences Big Momma drag doesnt quite fit together and sometimes comes apart at the seams. The ""fat suit"" makes him awkward. Its difficult for him to turn his neck without turning his whole body -- except when hes called upon to dance or spring into police action. Theres one wince-making subject that cannot be avoided. ""Big Mommas House"" begins with some of the grossest bathroom humor and undignified exposure of an actress for laughs that Ive seen on the screen. I thought the whole movie was headed for the toilet which is where this scene occurs. Its not my place to apologize for it. They did it. Its there. ""Big Mommas House"" progresses from gross-out to legitimately gained hilarity to sentiment. When alls said and done its quite sweet-natured. Big Momma certainly gets the respect she commands as the story unfolds. She isnt the only one Lawrence impersonates. Looking like his own self Lawrence the FBI agent impersonates a handyman smitten by Sherry (Nia Long ""Boiler Room"") Big Mommas granddaughter who arrives with her 10-year-old son. It is a tribute to the comics accomplishment that the interest level noticeably rises every time Lawrence returns as the tough old lady. Excuses are found to get Momma on the basketball court and in karate class where instructor Anthony Anderson is particularly funny and she ""testifies"" in church. There are double-entendre sex jokes and the body-function humor includes fat jokes and gas jokes and birthing jokes. The PG-13 rating may be something of a surprise to parents. They might want to talk to their kids about this one and the subject of respect and the role of humor is a good place to start. Advisory Extreme gross-out humor.

About all thats left of Lawrence are his strikingly mismatched eyes -- one innocent one street-cool. It may seem an act of desperation for a funnyman to put on this much of a costume but then a ""state of the art"" makeup bodysuit can in its way be creatively liberating; it can force a performer to find fresh nuances within his comic voice. Robin Williams as the title frump of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" used a Scottish burr to wicked effect sending one-liners coursing through the air like lethal Frisbees. And in ""The Nutty Professor"" Eddie Murphy had a mimics feast playing the gentleman blimp Sherman Klump and his cantankerous chorus of relatives. By contrast Lawrences performance in Big Mommas House is every bit as broad and cartoony as his disguise. He gives Big Momma a high faintly strangled delivery thats a quaver away from George Jeffersons; he doesnt speak the lines so much as blare them. Every once in a while this can be amusing as when Big Momma offers a secretly lusty welcome home hug to Sherry (Nia Long) the grandchild she hasnt seen in years and lets slip with a courtly/lascivious ""Oh Big Momma could never forget that ass"" But thats one of the only good bits in the movie and it registers even then with forgettable flippancy. Lawrence doesnt give Big Momma any special hidden slyness and thats because he doesnt appear to have any himself. Theres no ""there"" beneath the makeup. Most of the comedy derives from the way that Lawrences Agent Malcolm Turner who is out to catch Sherrys violent thief of an ex-boyfriend scrambles to keep his glaringly overcranked impersonation undercover. Theres a fair amount of gratuitous noisy slapstick as well Big Momma delivers a baby with oven mitts cooks up a skillet full of pork chops using a fiery overdose of shortnin and smashes through a window to foil a crook. When Robin Williams and Eddie Murphy clowned around in those earlier ""head to toe makeup"" comedies there were moments when I thought I could feel the spirit of Peter Sellers hovering with wry approval. In Big Mommas House its closer to the spirit of Bozo. Lawrence in his early-90s stand-up act often came on like Murphys little brother and he overplayed his eagerness to be applauded for prefab naughty-dog routines. Eagerness is Lawrences calling card Its what allows him to flip his personality as if by on-off switch from disgruntlement to jug-eared delight. Yet it doesnt leave him with much of a center or with the confidence to nail a joke by throwing it away. In formula crowd-pleasers like Blue Streak Nothing to Lose and now Big Mommas House Lawrence is so on that he appears to be gunning for clockwork bursts of audience approval. His movies make money but he wont be a true star until he exits the ""all shtick all the time"" zone.
