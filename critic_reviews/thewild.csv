His latest ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" will do nothing to sully that reputation being thoroughly quirky sweet funny and endearing.At its center is a chubby -- OK fat -- 13-year-old delinquent named Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison). Dubbed a ""bad egg"" by the foster care system hes brought to live on a remote farm near the New Zealand bush with the warm-hearted and patient Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and her tight-lipped husband Hector (Sam Neill reminding you how good he can be).Despite the authorities warnings about what a pain Ricky can be Bella wins him over and he actually comes to think of the farm as home. But then tragedy strikes and it looks like Ricky will be swept back into the foster care system or worse. Ricky decides to take refuge in the bush thousands of acres of deep forest.Where he promptly gets lost. Luckily Hector finds him. But then Hector has an accident and needs time to mend. While Ricky and Hector are camping in the woods the authorities come up with the fantasy that Rickys been kidnapped. Soon their absence is a nationwide news story and a manhunt is on.The great joy here is the clash of Rickys thug-inspired delusions -- his dog is named Tupac -- and Hectors grumpy reticence to make any connection. They are a classic odd couple with Hector the straight man and Ricky the bumbling effervescent innocent. But in this case theyre an odd couple on the run.Waititi (""What We Do in the Shadows"" ""Boy"" ""Eagle vs. Shark"") goes broad quite often but the film holds its singular tone. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is a hoot with heart.Tom Long is a longtime culture critic.twitter.com/toomuchTomLongHunt for the WilderpeopleGRADE B+Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including violent content and some languageRunning time 101 minutes 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/29UAWcq MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/07/14/movie-review-hunt-wilderpeople/87114072/,200,thewild0,thewild,detroitnews

Ricky (Julian Dennison) is a mound of urban teenage misery whose last stop before juvie is a tumbledown farm at the edge of the New Zealand wilderness. Bella (Rima Te Wiata) is his saintly new foster mom an unstoppable wellspring of love who is unfazed by his out-of-shape attempts to run away. And Hector (a bushy-bearded teddy bear-lovable Sam Neill) is his laconic leery ""uncle"" a man who has called bullshit on most of the world excepting of course his wife. It isnt long before the two men find themselves through circumstances both lamentable and ludicrous in the bush and on the run. Director Taika Waititi (who also adapted the screenplay) proves expert in his management of tone such that the farcical elements however numerous dont detract from the very real friendship the renegades develop as they elude the worlds most dedicated social services officer. Also such that the grimmer more ultimate realities of life -- death and bureaucracy to name two -- are given their due without being allowed to overshadow all. 2016. -- Matthew Lickona Related links ""Two to view""  July 13 2016 Showtimes Angelika Film Center 11620 Carmel Mountain Road San Diego 858-674-6164 | Directions Saturday July 30 300pm 525pm 745pm 1005pm Sunday July 31 1030am 1245pm 300pm 525pm 745pm 1005pm Monday August 1 1030am 1245pm 300pm 525pm 745pm 1005pm Tuesday August 2 1030am 1245pm 300pm 525pm 745pm 1005pm Wednesday August 3 1030am 1245pm 300pm 525pm 745pm 1005pm Thursday August 4 1030am 1245pm 300pm ArcLight La Jolla 4425 La Jolla Village Drive Suite H60 San Diego 858-768-7770 | Directions Sunday July 31 915am 1105am Monday August 1 1100am Tuesday August 2 1100am Wednesday August 3 1100am Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Comments Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Add this to your list of movies to see this month. Actually make it first on the lineup. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is the kind of adorable coming-of-age dramedy that Pixar would proudly create if it made live-action movies and not cartoons. Its a well-told adventure spoof with a delinquent kid played by newcomer Julian Dennison and a gruff codger played by veteran Sam Neill on the run from the cops. Its crammed with remarkable jokes and great performances heart-twanging moments of pathos awesome cinematography and an overall sense of rambunctious creative joy. This is the kind of independently produced delight that studios have entirely abandoned touching sweetness without saccharine schmaltz. Dennisons Ricky is a preteen headache for the child welfare services and the foster families where bureaucrats assign him. Hes in trouble for ""breaking stuff stealing stuff hitting stuff kicking stuff and setting stuff on fire."" Never nasty but usually naughty hes a troublemaker largely because hes troubled himself a chubby baby pretending to be a gangsta. As an 11th-hour effort to keep him out of juvenile prison the authorities give him a last-ditch placement with two backwoods guardians. Warm Aunt Bella (Rima Te Wiata) loves him like a new pet in their shabby cabin; her dismissive husband Uncle Hec (Neill) regards Ricky as if hes not housebroken. Hunt for the Wilderpeople  out of 4 stars Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including violent content and for some language. Theater Lagoon. The creator of this charmer is Taiki Waititi a half-Maori New Zealander who is not yet much recognized elsewhere. If you werent lucky enough to see his offbeat writing-directing work in 2014s hilarious vampire mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows"" or HBOs comedy series ""Flight of the Conchords"" about the Kiwis fourth most popular folk duo you might have missed him. That wont last. Hes directing Marvels third Thor movie ""Ragnarok"" and scripted Disneys upcoming animated feature ""Moana"" which are about the most convincing seals of mainstream approval a moviemaker can receive. An excellent actor himself he visits the story as a remarkably awkward pastor turning a funeral service into a nitwit farce. None of the storys excellent twists and surprises will be spoiled here. Just know that Hec and Ricky go AWOL together in the vast forest and the boys social worker Paula (Rachel House) assumes it is a molesters child abduction requiring a national manhunt. Paula a cocky idiot who acts like a hotshot and gets everything wrong is wrong again. The pairs push-pull relationship leads to some scares but largely draws them wonderfully close together even as they deal with some uproariously funny perversion jokes. Digging herself ever deeper into absurdity Paula launches a pursuit with battalions of police that descends into classic 1970s chase-movie car-flipping. Thats one of several sly pop-culture nods in a film full of amazements. Waititi creates a panoramic 720-degree camera turn across a large collection of characters outdoors to advance the story by weeks without dull old-school exposition. ""Jurassic Parks"" Neill a dramatic major leaguer offers a master class on how to be sidesplitting on-screen without cracking a single smile. You may have seen unlikely interracial and cross-generational buddy comedies before but nothing as hip and engaging as this goofy comedy of errors. It is entirely good in every way a family movie can be. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

You know -- those curveballs that derail the best-laid plans for better or worse. In the case of ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" the captivating new film from New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi (""Boy"" ""What We Do in the Shadows"") its definitely for the better when a taciturn city tween enters the world of a set-in-his-ways country-dwelling senior citizen. Their lives will forever change no matter how much they think they dont want them to. The kid in question is pudgy and feisty Ricky Baker (the endearing Julian Dennison in whats sure to be his breakout performance) whos spent most of his 13 years on earth moving from foster home to foster home learning to be that tough little kid on the outside while writing and reciting haikus to reveal his true inner feelings. We meet him as hes being ""delivered"" to his final chance at a normal life the farmhouse of his ""aunt"" Bella (Rima Te Wiata in wonderful turn) and her partner Hec the aforementioned cantankerous sixtysomething (Sam Neill in a marvelous performance). The couple lives a bucolic farm life with only the occasional slaughtering of wild boars with knives and their bare hands and taking in rescue dogs and in the case of Ricky a rescue child. There is much love on the farm thanks mostly to Bella and life is good until her sudden passing sets in motion the rest of this darkly humorous film based on the best-selling novel ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by the late Barry Crump. When Hec insists on returning Ricky to the system which has so tragically failed him the young boy decides to run off into the New Zealand bush (Lachlan Milnes cinematography is breathtaking) where of course he is quickly lost and of course he is found by the expert outdoorsman Hec. When an injury forces them to remain at large instead of returning to the farm the authorities suspect the worst and a national manhunt ensues. Heading deeper and deeper into the lush countryside the street-smart Ricky teaches Hec the finer points of absconding with supplies from unsuspecting hikers and campers; Hec teaches Ricky how to survive in the wild by hunting foraging and eating giant slugs if necessary. Ricky must have his toilet paper; Hec must have his freedom. Meanwhile back at the farm a series of misunderstandings and conclusion-jumping leads authorities to believe Hec has absconded with the child and god-knows-what is going on out there in the wild. Soon there are hunters SWAT teams helicopters squadrons of police and one very determined (and hilarious) child services officer Paula (Rachel House) hot on the trail of the buddies (for by now the two have come to realize they really do care about one another). Ricky and Hec soon become social media darlings and final 10 minutes of the film seem a bit contrived as the climactic car chase (reminiscent of ""Thelma and Louise"") comes to its resolution. But thats a small price to pay in an otherwise charming film that will touch your heart on so many levels. The friendship that develops between Ricky and Hec is priceless; they are each others salvation whether they realize it or not. The films title is a reference to wildebeests those massive horned antelope-like creatures known for migrating thousands of miles across African plains to reach grazing grounds. Ricky likens his trek to theirs -- not quite as extensive but every bit as life-changing. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is all about life-changing moments and the people who are the catalysts. Its about learning from those around you regardless of age or circumstance. Its about learning to trust in yourself and the meaningful people around you. Its about family and realizing the only ""normal"" family is one filled with love and understanding and discipline and strength of character and sometimes tragedy. As the happy-go-lucky Bella tells the newly arrived Ricky early on ""Im so happy we found you; sorry it took so long."" Home is where the heart is. 1/2 The Orchard presents a film written and directed by Taika Waititi based on the novel ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by Barry Crump. Running time 101 minutes.

Photo Credit The Orchard advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In rural New Zealand a weird foster kid and his grouchy new guardian become accidental subjects of a nationwide manhunt.CAST Sam Neill Julian Dennison Rachel HouseRATED PG-13 (language some rugged scenes)LENGTH 141PLAYING AT Roslyn Cinemas Sag Harbor Cinema and Stony Brook 17.BOTTOM LINE A lopsided gem full of off-kilter humor hard truths and real emotion. Great for preteens and up. One of the best coming-of-age films to hit American theaters ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" comes from far-flung New Zealand. Its based on a book by Barry Crump a national treasure there and has become the highest-grossing local production in the countrys history. Here however its an art-house release playing locally in a handful of theaters. That means you might have limited time to see this lovely lopsided gem of a movie. A wry comedy with a tender core ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" tells the story of a troubled foster child Ricky (newcomer Julian Dennison) who is dropped off at a remote cabin in the care of Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and her husband Hec (Sam Neill). ""Hes a real bad egg"" says Rickys child services officer Paula (Rachel House). Gravely she lists his worst crimes as spitting kicking and ""throwing stuff."" advertisement | advertise on newsday This is our first clue that ""Wilderpeople"" takes place in a hostile yet somehow wonderful world. True evil may not exist but uncaring institutions and flawed adults do. Bella showers Ricky with love but also with mean jokes about his weight. Hec simply shoos him away. As children do Ricky makes the best of it but when misfortune strikes he runs off into the bush pursued by a reluctant Hector. Thanks to a misunderstanding -- some hunters mistake Hec for a pedophile -- the two become the subject of a nationwide manhunt. Photos10 best movies of 2016 so farSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016 Written and directed by Taika Waititi possibly the best known Kiwi director since Peter Jackson (hes spearheading the upcoming Marvel blockbuster ""Thor Ragnarok"") ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is an oddball story populated by delightfully strange characters. Its linchpin though is Neill whose performance as Hector -- an anti-social grouch with no use for a kid who speaks in gangsta rap -- may be his finest to date. Hec never melts emotionally which makes his eventual fondness for Ricky all the more moving. If its possible to be cockeyed and clear-eyed at once this movie achieves it. The combination of eccentric humor and hard-won truth makes ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" something special.

Comments (1) Hunt for the Wilderpeople Recommended Video Rated PG-13  101 minutes  2016 In the mountains of New Zealand a troublesome foster child (Julian Dennison) is delivered into the care of an elderly couple (Sam Neill Rima Te Wiata) and ultimately he and the old man must go on the run fending for themselves in the wild. Based on Barry Crumps 1986 novel Wild Pork and Watercress this spirited comic adventure by writer-director Taika Waititi shares more in common with his gentle character-driven drama Boy (2010) than his recent vampire farce What We Do in the Shadows (2014). Like Mark Twain Waititi looks for humor in quirks of character and degrees of stubbornness and the natural challenges of Crumps wilderness journey generate a succession of belly laughs onscreen as the gruff old man scraps with the loudmouthed kid a pudgy hip-hopper looking for a challenge equal to his will.

EntertainmentMovies Hunt for the Wilderpeople Quirky characters on the run in New Zealand Originally published July 7 2016 at 955 am Updated July 11 2016 at 1250 pm A troubled city kid (Julian Dennison) and his foster caregiver (Sam Neill) go on the run in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople."" ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes the audience on a rollicking yet poignant journey through the New Zealand backcountry. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Laugh-out-loud funny one minute achingly sad the next ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes the audience on a rollicking yet poignant journey through the New Zealand backcountry in the company of a pair of engagingly eccentric characters. One is a pudgy troubled city kid named Ricky (Julian Dennison) whos been nothing but trouble for most of his 13 years on the planet. Arson tagging spitting are just a few of the transgressions that have had him bouncing from foster home to foster home until he fetches up at a ramshackle farm deep in the mountains that a no-nonsense child-protective services lady (Rachel House) assures him is the last stop before juvenile hall. The other main character is a grouchy old graybeard named Hec (Sam Neill) husband of the down-to-earth mistress of the place Bella (Rima Te Wiata) who encourages the lad to call her Aunty. Movie Review    Hunt for the Wilderpeople with Julian Dennison Sam Neill Rima Te Wiata Rachel House. Written and directed by Taika Waititi. 101 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including violent content and for some language. Sundance Cinemas (21+) From her the kid finds acceptance and love two things Rickys never known in his short life. He comes out of his shell. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Seems the authorities think Hec has kidnapped the kid. New Zealand writer-director Taika Waititi seamlessly switches up emotional beats throughout the picture offering a heart-rending scene of a man wailing with grief that is beyond words to express and later serving up a comic passage featuring a cheery garrulous lunatic capering through the woods disguised as a bush. Waititis writing is strong and the pictures characters are wonderfully distinctive. Dennison is a real find navigating Rickys complex emotional depths with seemingly effortless ease. Neill gives an understated portrayal of a capable but damaged woodsman. And the female characters are extraordinarily well-realized with Te Wiata stealing every scene shes in playing a woman with a mischievous sense of humor and a kind heart.

Whats a Wilderpeople? And why would anyone hunt them?RELATED What new movie is 100 percent fresh at Rotten Tomatoes?Dont worry youll find out and you wont be sorry. Taika Waititis film is smart and sweet and just sour enough to keep it from being saccharine. Its the story of a boy trying to find acceptance after being shunted from foster home to foster home. Once he thinks hes finally found a place where he may belong things change and he heads out on the lam with someone who doesnt want him around.Sam Neill stars in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople."" (Photo Madman Entertainment)So yes the elements of the story are somewhat familiar. But Waititi who wrote the screenplay based on a book by Barry Crump tells it perfectly balancing the humor drama and heartbreak flawlessly. This is no surprise; Waititi directed ""Boy"" about a kid learning the truth about his less-than-ideal father and co-directed ""What We Do in the Shadows"" a pitch-perfect fake documentary about vampires that is both hilarious and gory. Waititi who also appears in his films may have the surest handle on tone of any director working today.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceRicky (Julian Dennison) is 12 when we meet him a self-styled ""gangsta."" In fact hes a chubby kid who hasnt fit in at any of the homes where New Zealands child welfare services have placed him. The overzealous Paula (Rachel House) warns his new foster mother Bella (Rima Te Wiata) of Rickys tendencies and the boy knows this is the last stop before ""juvie.""Then Hec Bellas husband (Sam Neill all the hair on his head and face overgrown) appears over the hill with a giant boar strapped to his back. If he doesnt seem happy to see anyone its because hes not.Julian Dennison in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople."" (Photo Madman Entertainment)Bella has just the right touch with Ricky. Going to run away again tonight she asks? Havent decided Ricky says. Fine if you do -- just be back for breakfast. As for Ricky his hardened O.G. act -- he names the dog that Hec and Bella give him for his 13th birthday Tupac -- is hilarious.But events conspire to send Ricky and an unhappy Hec into the bush on the run. This is not some father-son camping trip. This is a months-long quest for escape and survival in harsh terrain with seemingly half the country looking for them -- most notably the increasingly aggressive Paula.Hec and Ricky become celebrities of a sort. At first there is concern. Did Hec kidnap Ricky? Is he abusing him? But the national mood shifts. A couple of run-ins with hunters with a reward on their minds do nothing to increase your faith in your fellow man.Julian Dennison (left) and Sam Neill star in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople."" (Photo Madman Entertainment)Hec and Ricky do however. Using just the right touch Waititi slowly reveals more and more about each character. Its neither a spoiler nor a surprise that they warm to each other but Waititi avoids cliches. Its not all warm and fuzzy out there in the bush but it is awfully funny.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestDennison is a marvel completely unself-conscious in his portrayal of a kid who is lost but thinks if he acts tough itll look like hes found. Neill playing a different sort of character for him (quiet unfriendly) is also outstanding. You dont automatically get a response from Hec. You earn one. But theres a heart in the grizzled old man somewhere.Itll be interesting to see if Waititi retains his touch with his next film ""Thor Ragnarok"" a step into the blockbuster big-time. If he does or doesnt well still have this film and his others. The best way I know how to put it is that as with his earlier movies you will delight in spending time with these characters.

Sam Neill left and Julian Dennison in a scene from ""Hunt For The Wilderpeople."" Photo Associated Press Gruff Sam Neill teams with kid in Hunt for the Wilderpeople 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Life in remote parts of New Zealand must forge hardy souls judging from the characters in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" the gifted director Taika Waititis last film before heading off to Hollywood. Its the kind of place where a troubled teen is taken into his latest foster home and among the objects in his new room is ""a nice sharp knife to kill the monsters in the night"" says his foster mom who herself can kill wild boars with one; and his foster dad never bothered to learn how to read. But like anywhere in todays world (sadly) you can become a social media star even in the remotest part of it. Weve seen the formula for ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" before -- crotchety old man clashes/bonds with troubled teen -- but when the old man is played by Sam Neill who has his best part in years and is presented with the assured quirkiness of Waititi who scored a hit with the vampire horror comedy ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and is now directing the third ""Thor"" movie its a winning formula. Ricky (Julian Dennison) is a piece of work -- a roly-poly juvenile delinquent who is used to a more urban environment. He is given a choice by his counselor (Rachel House) of jail or placement at a remote rural house presumably a place where he can do little damage. His foster mother Bella (Rima Te Wiata wonderful) takes to him right away although her gruff husband Hec (Neill) wont speak to him unless necessary. Just as Ricky is starting to enjoy a foster home for the first time Bella collapses and dies of a heart attack. Since the terms of the foster care require a mother figure the state must reclaim him. The grief-stricken Hec soon to be rid of the boy decides to disappear into the wilderness. Ricky fearing jail relentlessly follows him. The outside world believes Hec to be a possible molester who has kidnapped Ricky and an extensive manhunt is mounted. The rural inhabitants who follow the media reports of the case see them as rebellious heroes escaping from overextended government reach. ""Im reminded of First Blood"" a TV reporter intones. ""John Rambo a man alone. Of course theyre two men alone."" Filled with gorgeous vistas of mountainous New Zealand -- it almost feels like an epic at times -- and oddball characters ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" has much to recommend it but none of it would work unless Hec and Ricky are believable and have chemistry. Fortunately they do. As Hec Neill who is 68 has skin like sun-parched leather a sandpaper voice and absolutely no parenting skills. As Ricky Dennison is a misfit with a creative streak (he writes haiku poetry) and as his resourcefulness improves he becomes gradually more useful during their wilderness journey. What are they after? Hec is desperately trying to avoid becoming a ""form-filler"" like the average human. Ricky wants to live in Rickyville (""Population Ricky""). Of course what theyre really after is to retain a sense of individualism in a world that works against that. One hopes Waititi can retain a sense of his own quirky individualism during his Hollywood adventures. G. Allen Johnson is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The cranky charisma of the performers plus the cheerfully idiosyncratic rhythms of Waititis filmmaking keep it clicking Coming-of-age stories finding-yourself-in-the-wilderness stories fugitives-on-the-run stories If youve been watching movies for any length of time youve already seen multiple versions of all of these. But you probably havent seen anything quite like New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititis Hunt for the Wilderpeople which rolls all of those genres into a buoyant expansive breezily enjoyable whole. Depending on how you look at it its either a comedy with solid dramatic underpinnings or a drama so light on its feet that it plays like the purest comedy. Either way the cranky charisma of the performers plus the cheerfully idiosyncratic rhythms of Waititis filmmaking keep it clicking. Twelve-year-old Ricky (Julian Dennison) is an alleged juvenile delinquent in the making His crimes as enumerated by the social worker who has escorted him to one foster home after another (the drily hilarious Rachel House) include ""stealing spitting throwing rocks kicking stuff and defacing stuff"" as well as the classic ""loitering."" These transgressions shown in a fleet skittering montage are hardly grave. But no one seems to want Ricky a heavy-set kid who puts up a glum gangsta front but who actually has a fondness for reading and a knack for putting his feelings into haiku on the fly. He finds his place at last in a ramshackle house in the middle of nowhere with Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and her gruff laconic husband Hec (Sam Neill). Bella is a lover of cat figurines. She can also kill a wild hog with barely a tussle using just a knife. Ricky comes to adore her--you understand why when you hear the ridiculous song she composes and performs for his thirteenth birthday--but her sudden death leaves him and Hec stranded emotionally. Hec doesnt seem to care much for Ricky. And so knowing that hes going to be sent off to another home Ricky runs off into the bush with his dog Tupac. Hec finds him but a series of mini-disasters keep the duo trekking through the wilderness for months. They come to understand each other but it takes longer than youd think for them to actually like each other. Waititi adapted the film from New Zealand novelist Barry Crumps 1986 Wild Pork and Watercress. But if youve seen Waititis previous film the wild woolly and jovial vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows (featuring Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords) youll notice his distinctive oddball stamp on this one. Waititi has a gift for keeping a story moving not in a straight predictable line but in an errant zigzag that holds your attention As a filmmaker hes like a kid jumping from one jagged rock to another--you keep watching just to see how hell complete each crazy leap. He also appears in a cameo here during a funeral sequence thats almost criminally funny. Hunt for the Wilderpeople--the title refers to Rickys realization that he and Hec are like wildebeests on the run--is made up of dozens of familiar elements but Waititi assembles them into something wise and generous and eccentrically funny. Glimpsed from afar it might look an ordinary creature. You have to get up close to see how rare it is. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Hes trouble. Big trouble. The overweight orphan who looks a bit like Cartman from South Park has given a series of foster parents so much attitude over the years that no one will take him. Hes so bad he doesnt think twice about spitting throwing stuff writing graffiti and shoplifting. ""Hes a bad egg"" says his case worker Paula (Rachel House) to the one couple left in all of New Zealand who agrees to foster the boy Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and Hector (Sam Neill) an aging pair of world-class eccentrics who live far far out in the countryside. Portrayed by the amazing Kiwi teen Julian Dennison in a star turn Ricky is the rebellious antihero in Hunt for the Wilderpeople a surreal heart-melting comedy adventure set in New Zealands wild bushlands. Adapted from a Barry Crump novel Hunt is the latest gem from writer-director Taika Waititi who co-wrote and co-directed the incredible vampire comedy What We Do in the Shadows. Its as near perfect a film as Ive ever seen. Propelled by a wild mix of absurdist humor and pathos Hunt is an epic coming-of-age story that has Ricky traverse a gauntlet of emotions and experiences. Bella offers him profound love and acceptance. Despite his preference for city life Ricky and his dog Tupac grow to love life in the country. Early in the film Bella dies and Ricky is left alone with Hector a misanthrope so affected by his loss he lashes out at Ricky. Then the two chase each other into the bush - and end up travelling across the wild countryside for more than five months. Theyre chased by cops social workers hunters haters and maladjusted parents who find it unacceptable that a 12-year-old boy and a 60-year-old man should just drop out of society. The photography is lush the dialogue uproarious and the crazy action sequences unforgettable. Like Wes Andersons Rushmore Hunt for the Wilderpeople magically taps into the logic thought processes and emotions of a child. Its a rich strange and wondrous world.tirdadphillynews.com215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW Hunt for the Wilderpeople ssss (Out of four stars) y Directed by Taika Waititi.

(The Orchard) Ricky Baker is an orphaned juvenile delinquent a ""real bad egg"" as an onscreen title announces in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" Taika Waititis endearingly playful adventure tale set in the New Zealand bush. When Ricky is sent to live with foster parents Bella and Hec Faulkner on their farm its not exactly a match made in heaven. Minutes after arriving the sullen preteen takes one lap around the house and circles straight back into the police car he arrived in. In time though he settles in eventually joining Hec on an epic journey through the wilderness while eluding the predatory clutches of social services vigilante do-gooders and well-armed police and military squads. As portrayed by Julian Dennison and Sam Neill Ricky and Hec slip easily into kid-and-curmudgeon camaraderie with Dennison making the most of his stout frame and Neill still evincing the handsomeness that made him a heartthrob in ""My Brilliant Career"" even if its buried here under a bushy white beard and a perpetual scowl. ""You can call him Uncle"" the sweet-natured Bella (Rima Te Wiata) tells Ricky when he arrives. ""No he cant"" Hec barks back rolling a cigarette. And so it goes in a buddy comedy in which the joshing lighthearted humor in time gives way to outright silliness worthy of Monty Python at its most absurdly outlandish (with a nod toward ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"" for good measure). Adapted by Waititi from Barry Crumps 1986 novel ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" ""Wilderpeople"" possesses the same goofy irreverence the filmmaker brought to his vampire satire ""What We Do in the Shadows"" which burst with similar larky joie de vivre. Appearing in a funny cameo as an eccentric preacher Waititi is an expansive warm-hearted humanist. The fun he pokes is strictly superficial never grazing his characters vital organs or essential dignity. Structured as a series of brief antic chapters ""Hunt For the Wilderpeople"" gives viewers the added bonus of spectacular scenery taking them on a journey through New Zealands exquisite forests mountains and lakes that become characters in themselves. At times awkwardly staged -- especially when it comes to some dubious gunplay at a forest rest cabin and a gratuitously wacky climax -- this fanciful fable nonetheless finds its own rhythm especially as Rickys natural exuberance begins to wear away at Hecs impenetrable sulk. Even when it dispenses with realism altogether ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" conveys important truths about the will and sheer endurance it takes to make a family. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains mature thematic material violence and some coarse language. 101 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Hunt for the Wilderpeople A troubled kid and his foster dad become fugitives -- and folk heroes -- in this New Zealand sleeper hit Julian Dennison and Sam ONeill in Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By David Fear June 26 2016 More News Meet the Men Behind the Years Best Vampire Mockumentary Raiders How Two Kids Made the Greatest Fan Film Ever When Animals Attack Ranking Bloodthirsty Movie Predators All Stories >> The coming-of-age tale the on-the-run road movie the buddy comedy the boys adventure story -- all genres that require a steady hand and a singular sensibility and all of which youll find in Taika Waititis goofy giddy mash-up about two fugitives fleeing authorities in the New Zealand bush. The fact that one half of this criminal couple is a troubled chubby Maori foster kid named Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison a deadpan delight) suggests tough-love bromides are on deck. (Thanks to the lads infatuation with urban rebels some no-brainer pop culture references as well His new dog is immediately christened ""Tupac."") The other outlaw is his ""uncle"" a crusty old outdoorsman who answers to Hec (Jurassic Parks Sam Neill) and wants little to do with his wifes adopted addition to the household. Boom Youve got your tried-and-true mismatch. The unreachable irresistible force versus the cantankerous immovable object -- its not a question of if these defensive icebergs will melt so much as when. More News Meet the Men Behind the Years Best Vampire Mockumentary Raiders How Two Kids Made the Greatest Fan Film Ever When Animals Attack Ranking Bloodthirsty Movie Predators All Stories >> Related Alt-Summer Movie Preview 2016 The Wild WTF and Oh-So-True From docs on sex scandals and rock stars to a stop-motion samurai epic your cure for the summer blockbuster blues Even if viewers dont know the source material -- Barry Crumps 1986 novel Wild Pork and Watercress -- theyll know the bonding is inevitable especially once circumstances force Ricky and Hec into the wild with a Javert-like child-services worker (Rachel House) in pursuit. The only mystery is how Hunt for the Wilderpeople will handle the journey and the instinct is to brace for feel-good impact. Waititi tends to go for either overbaked silliness like 2007s Eagle vs. Shark or the undercooked sappiness of 2010s my-dysfunctional-childhood parable Boy. (The major outlier is What We Do in the Shadows a 2014 collaboration with Flight of the Conchords Jemaine Clement that instantly established itself as the greatest vampire mockumentary ever.) Hes splitting the difference here ping-ponging between self-conscious ridiculousness and a sort of heartstring-molesting melodrama with the occasional Wes Anderson-ish fussiness -- dig those fancy-font chapter titles -- and tense boar attack thrown in for good measure. But Waititi also knows theres a unique groove to be found in the middle of all of this and when the movie syncs up everything from its auteurs facility for sight gags to the actors impressive young-fuck-up-meets-old-fart chemistry Wilderpeople generates enough good will to make the stalest of plot devices feel semi-fresh. A little bit of left-of-center humor in a funeral sermon on Jesus and junk food (delivered by Waititi himself as a daffy local priest) makes up for a lot of forced quirk; an innate sense of knowing when to back off from being overtly crowd-pleasing balances out some obvious detours into crowd-pandering a la not-one-but-two of Rickys ""Shit just got real"" exclamations. For all the stock elements thrown into this indie-cutie gumbo its still flavorful enough to stand out -- an oddball and oddly affecting take on two misfits finding their metaphorical partner-in-crime match.

June 23 2016The Neon DemonStarring Elle Fanning Jena Malone Abbey Lee Bella Heathcoate Keanu Reeves and Christina Hendricks. Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Opens Friday at major theatres. 117 minutes. 14AThe ideal audience for The Neon Demon would be a theatre where every seat had a mirror tilted toward the screen. This is a film in love with its own reflection one that is by turns gorgeous and horrifying.Director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive Only God Forgives) is convinced that profundity resides beneath the shallows of narcissism. Its a tough sell but an intoxicating one especially upon subsequent viewings.Article Continued BelowRefn is hardly the first moviemaker to find a link between supermodels and scary monsters but he may be the most style-minded one to make the connection. Imagine an issue of Vogue with Maleficent as guest editor.The Neon Demon swoons along with the Hollywood denizens who encounter Elle Fannings Jesse a hayseed with an angels face (but maybe not the innocence) who seeks L.A. stardom just past the age of 16. Her beauty youth and implacability ruffle the feathers and sharpen the teeth of fixated fashionistas played by Jena Malone Abbey Lee and Bella Heathcote all slightly older than Jesse (20 is considered ancient in this jaded realm). They jealously consider her both a threat and a celestial presence ""Youre the sun"" one hungrily admires.Jesse lives in a Pasadena motel managed by Keanu Reeves sleazy Hank who has more kinks than a Slinky. Yet he -- and the mountain lion that somehow breaks into her room -- pose merely natural threats.Frequent Refn collaborator Cliff Martinez heightens the dread with his seductive electronic score which beautifully meshes with Natasha Braiers iridescent cinematography. Together they make the vapid seem deep.- Peter HowellTickledDocumentary directed by David Farrier and Dylan Reeve. Opens Friday at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema. 91 minutes. PGThis New Zealand doc tickles the funny bone but also chills the spine. It delves into a goofy fetish that leads down serious and unsettling paths. Journalist David Farrier and co-director Dylan Reeve begin their film as a humorous report on a peculiar yet apparently harmless ""sport"" called ""Competitive Endurance Tickling."" Farrier specializes in ""looking at the weird and bizarre side of life"" and this certainly qualifies.He and Reeve get way more than they bargained for. Their investigation follows a labyrinth of Internet links involving cyberbullying identity fraud online shaming and extortion. Not much should be said about the film going in -- it proceeds like a thriller -- but its no spoiler to say that anyone who has seen the 2010 doc Catfish will recognize how deception is now very much a part of online activities.- Peter HowellFree State of JonesStarring Matthew McConaughey Gugu Mbatha-Raw Mahershala Ali and Keri Russell. Directed by Gary Ross. Opens Friday at major theatres. 120 minutes. 14AA Civil War rebellion becomes an enervating movie by Gary Ross.Determined to instruct more than inspire producer/director/writer Ross (Hunger Games) unspools a fact-based and overly familiar historical narrative of the righteous white freedom fighter. Matthew McConaughey capably stars as Newton Knight an 1860s Mississippi farmer rebelling against war and slavery although in so doing he creates his own militia of former slaves and fellow farmers. The first half proceeds well enough when Knight and his conscripts are defending their land against both Confederate and Union forces. Two renegade slaves emerge as particular allies -- Gugu Mbatha-Raws Rachel and Mahershala Alis Moses -- but its clearly the bigger stars movie.The story splinters in the postwar second half when too much exposition is crammed in (including a 20th century court case) and momentum is lost.- Peter HowellHunt for the WilderpeopleStarring Sam Neill Julian Dennison Rima Te Wiata and Rachel House. Written and directed by Taika Waititi. Opens Friday at Cineplex Yonge amp; Dundas. 101 minutes. PGNew Zealand writer-director Taika Waititi blends sharply cynical humour with huge heart in arguably his best film to date Hunt for the Wilderpeople. Pudgy Ricky Baker (a perfect Julian Dennison) has been written off as a bad egg by childrens services.But foster ""aunt"" Bella (Rima Te Wiata) sees the good in the oddball kid who expresses himself with crude haikus even if her cranky husband Hec (Sam Neill) has no time for the newcomer.Circumstances send Ricky on the run deep into the wilderness bush with survivorman Hec. Their adventure blends humour and warmth as the two chafe share secrets and warily bond. Gorgeous scenery excellent cast and a freshly clever script from Waititi who also triumphed with Boy and What We Do in the Shadows make for a must-see film.- Linda BarnardFastball (DVD)Documentary on the most feared baseball pitch written and directed by Jonathan Hock. Narrated by Kevin Costner. Available on DVD June 28. STCESPN director Jonathan Hock throws straight and true with this history of baseballs most important pitch.Hock illuminates and entertains as he sketches portraits of the greats from original fireballer Walter Johnson to the indomitable Nolan Ryan. Batters cant always see a fastball but they sure can hear it ""It sounds like trouble"" says ex-Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter.Combining rare archival footage with contemporary interviews Hock chases both the legend and science of the fastball something that couldnt even be precisely measured until the radar gun arrived in the 1970s.We learn why theres a world of difference between a 92 mph (148.12 km/h) ball and a 100 mph (161 km/h) one and why physicists dispute batters claim of a ""rise"" over the plate.Dont listen to them record hitter Hank Aaron says ""I dont believe they ever played baseball.""- Peter Howell The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 24 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Jun. 27 2016 1104AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Taika Waititi Written by Taika Waititi Starring Julian Dennison Sam Neill Classification PG Country New Zealand Language English A sullen boy tired of bouncing around foster care. A curmudgeonly widower with no interest in children. A child-services rep desperate to instill order to the system. Those may sound like the perfect ingredients for a saccharine drama about loving and learning but in writer-director Taika Waititis hands theyre merely the necessary elements to concoct a subversive wildly entertaining comedy about the power of misfits and the strength of good humour. At nearly every point in Hunt for the Wilderpeople it seems like the story might take the easy way out and devolve into cheap sentimentality as Ricky (Julian Dennison) struggles to survive in the New Zealand bush with his taciturn caretaker Hec (Sam Neill giving a career-best perforfmance). Instead Waititi (whos also responsible for the best comedy of 2015 What We Do in the Shadows and will next tackle the third Thor film) executes a series of deft narrative U-turns twisting the tale into 101 minutes of pure comic joy.

Waititi who was a writer and director of that cult HBO series has carried on the shows New Zealand deadpan and childlike whimsy with varying success. Often collaborating with ""Conchords"" star Jermaine Clement Waititi has previously seesawed too far into quirk (2007s oddball romance ""Eagle vs Shark"") and risen to heights of comic understatement (2015s vampire mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows""). In ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" a huge hit in Waititis native New Zealand also delights in teetering - clumsily but charmingly - between fantasy and reality. The film is a fable about a heavy-set foster kid Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison) and a reluctant foster parent ""Uncle"" Hector (Sam Neill) who evading child services go on the lam and spark a manhunt. As far as buddy comedy pairings go few can match the unlikeliness of that in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople."" Having run through foster families Ricky introduced as ""a very bad egg"" is dropped off at the remote home of Aunt Bella (an excellent Rima Te Wiata who leaves the film too soon) and Hector. At first glance Ricky is terribly unsuited for country life. On his first night he tries to run away but gets no further than halfway up the nearest hillside. Just as Ricky begins warming to life with Bella (the gruff Hector largely evades him) tragedy comes out of the blue and Ricky is to be retrieved by child welfare. But Ricky and Hector each fed up with society resolve to ""go bush."" They totter into the mountains and an increasingly absurd chase ensues led by a militant child services worker (Rachel House). The tale told in chapters comes from Barry Crumps 1986 novel ""Wild Pork and Watercress."" In Waititis hands its a jerky ride. There are passages that take after ""Psycho"" (a gratuitously bloody wild pig slaughter) and wintery poetic moments that reference ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller."" In their journey the pairs encounters are both tender and cartoonish ranging from an alluring young girl to a recluse named Psycho Sam (Rhys Darby the fabulous bug-eyed MVP of ""Conchords""). The grab bag of styles awkward as they are also supplies ""Wilderpeople"" its strange off-kilter energy. Its nimble enough to never be quite pinned down by its familiar concept before eventually going out in a blaze of farce. ""Wilderpeople"" is ultimately winning like all buddy comedies because of the chemistry of its leads. Neill (the Sundance of the two) and Dennison (our younger and portlier but no less cocksure Butch) make an endearing pair of runaways. On the heels of his recent successes Waititi has been picked by Marvel to direct the considerably more massive ""Thor Ragnarok."" As a test case of an indie director making a giant leap in scale it should be interesting. If Waititi can handle the Norse god with the same low-key modesty that hes approached vampires and outlaws Marvel may yet be brought down to size. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" an Orchard release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""thematic elements including violent content and for some language."" Running time 101 minutes. Three stars out of four. --- Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at http//twitter.com/jakecoyleAP (c) 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Credit The Orchard ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" takes a troika of familiar story types -- the plucky kid the crusty geezer the nurturing bosom -- and strips them of cliche. Charming and funny it is a drama masquerading as a comedy about an unloved boy whom nobody wants until someone says Yes Ill love him. Much of the humor comes from the child whos at once a pip and a gloriously expressive ambassador for the director Taika Waititis cleareyed take on human nature and movies. Mr. Waititi knows that we love to cry at sad and bad times but he also knows that people in pain need to get on with their lives.The story centers on the soon-to-be 13-year-old Ricky (the irresistible Julian Dennison) a New Zealand foster child who as the movie opens is being placed with an older couple who live in a pastoral clearing at the edge of the bush. Ricky rapidly bonds with the woman who goes by Aunty Bella (Rima Te Wiata as the nurturer) but hes kept at arms length by her gruff taciturn husband Uncle Hec (Sam Neill perfect as the house geezer). Like hippies time forgot Bella and Hec live off the land and its bounty including boar and the possums that she skins one handful of fur at a time. Video Anatomy | Hunt for the Wilderpeople Taika Waititi narrates a scene from his film with Sam Neill and Julian Dennison opening June 24. By MEKADO MURPHY on Publish Date June 16 2016. Photo by The Orchard. Watch in Times Video >> embed Mr. Waititi works fast setting a bright light comic mood that owes something to Wes Anderson but is organically his own. Mr. Waititi started out in comedy shifting to movie directing more than a decade ago with little evident strain. His first features (""Boy"" ""Eagle vs. Shark"") are imperfect but also unmistakably of an auteurist piece with strongly defined characters a deep sense of place and a humorously deadpan view of lifes absurdities. Theyre also very sweet. More recently he and his longtime friend the comic Jemaine Clement another New Zealander directed ""What We Do in the Shadows"" a cheerfully silly mockumentary about vampires living as roommates.The comedy in ""Wilderpeople"" is quieter than in Mr. Waititis earlier movies which strengthens the storys realism. Ricky is a funny kid. Hes amusing to look at for one thing what with his fish-out-of-water hip-hop threads and has a gift for bolts from the blue like the bad-boy haikus he creates (and recites) as part of his therapeutic training. As a child of social services he throws words like ""processing"" around though Mr. Waititi is careful when it comes to Rickys history which is scattered piecemeal throughout. Tragedy touches the characters in ""Wilderpeople"" but it doesnt define them and theyre not into sharing caring and closure like their American counterparts.Sorrow descends on ""Wilderpeople"" soon after it opens leaving Uncle Hec and Ricky first unmoored and then on the run in the bush where theyre chased by a social services zealot Paula (Rachel House) and her minion Andy (Oscar Kightley). Mr. Waititi likes to play with types of comedy but hes partial to modest exaggeration whether hes putting the joke across with slapstick songs caricature lovingly deployed insults or a flurry of tableaulike images. All the characters are funny and idiosyncratic but because they make you laugh in different ways they also register -- with the pointed exception of the cartoonish Paula and Andy -- as real people rather than as contrivances. Video Trailer Hunt For The Wilderpeople Raised on hip-hop and foster care defiant city kid Ricky gets a fresh start in the New Zealand countryside. He quickly finds himself at home with his new foster family the loving Aunt Bella the cantankerous Uncle Hec and dog Tupac. When a traged By THE ORCHARD on Publish Date May 7 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed Drawn in crayon by Mr. Waititi Paula and Andy are burlesques of bureaucratic incompetency. Theres an obvious political dimension to Paulas fanatical overblown crusade to flush Ricky and Uncle Hec out of the bush but her mania is mostly just another clown car that Mr. Waititi enjoys taking out for a spin. For the most part Mr. Waititis politics are as matter of fact as his humor and expressed through his gritty singular characters some of whom happen to be white others of whom happen to be Maori. (Mr. Waititi also wrote the movie adapting it from the book ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by Barry Crump a best-selling author and self-styled bushman.)Mr. Waititis expansive sense of human beings in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" allows his characters to endure loss and hardship without forcing them to be wholly limited by their suffering as marginalized people too often are in fiction. Theyre romantic and pragmatic eccentric and utterly ordinary. Theyre also reasonably flawed as is this movie but Mr. Waititi transcends most of the narrative bumps and generally dodges the obvious land mines including cuteness. Hes still finding his way but hes already a director who -- as he does in a shot of a friendly undefeated child pausing to wave at a pursuer -- can distill a worldview into a single perfect cinematic moment.""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned). This is a boys adventure story with many of the familiar genre trappings including guns knives dangerous animals and equally threatening people. Running time 1 hour 41 minutes.

Photo The Orchard By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 23 2016 338 p.m. ET 5 COMMENTS Sometimes in life a goofball preacher tells a tiny group of mourners in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" we may feel ""like a sheep trapped in a maze designed by wolves."" (The preacher is played by the films writer-director Taika Waititi.) Watching this lovely little lark from New Zealand you may feel like a happy camper on a twisty trail blazed by a cockeyed comic prodigy. More Reviews Free State of Jones Eat That Question Frank Zappa in His Own Words Related Coverage New Zealands Oddball Hit Taika Waititi Talks Finding the Humor in Thor Ragnarok The center of attention from the moment he arrives in a police car at a cabin in the boondocks is a kid named Ricky Baker (Julian Dennison). With his gangsta scowl and incipient jowls Ricky sees himself as a menace to society and his dim-bulb social worker Paula (Rachel House) could not agree more. In fact he has a tender heart and a head stuffed with pop-culture rubbish and he menaces only himself having already flunked out of so many foster-care placements that his last chance lies with a scruffy backwoods couple who are more or less willing to take him in. (The wife Rima Te Wiatas Bella covers him with unconditional love. Her husband Hec played by Sam Neill cant bear the sight of him.) Ricky is a wonderfully fresh creation the embodiment of hilarity--as well as the embodiment of embodiment given his alarming girth--because he doesnt see anything funny about anything least of all himself. Mr. Waititi perpetrated some very funny stuff as a performer and filmmaker in his previous feature ""What We Do in the Shadows"" a vampire comedy that he co-wrote and co-directed with Jemaine Clement. Yet this new one operates in a far more accessible realm where whimsy and absurdity mingle freely with real feelings and droll social satire. (The closest analogy that comes to mind is the alternate universe of Wes Andersons ""Moonrise Kingdom."") Sam Neill and Julian Dennison in Hunt for the Wilderpeople Photo The Orchard As an urban child of the digital age besotted by video games movies and TV Ricky doesnt make rigid distinctions between the reality of rural life and what he makes out to be a forest from ""The Lord of the Rings"" enhanced by smells and real dirt. That forest is where most of the movie plays out after a surprise plot turn--a genuine shocker--sends Ricky and Hec fleeing from their cabin accompanied by Tupac Rickys dog. For the kid its a great adventure a chance to chase around with a real gun playing outlaw. For Hec its pure misery at least at first playing father to a kid he deplores. ""Stick to the tracks"" he warns Ricky who goes off to look for help at one point. ""If you get desperate eat your dog."" For the cops then the army and always the Javert-like social worker Paula its a nationwide manhunt for a presumed pervert who has abducted a child. Mr. Neill is superb as a curmudgeon coming around to conditional love grudging kindness and finally overt pleasure even in such unlikely disputes as whether ""majestical"" is a real word. Tioreore Ngatai-Melbourne--what a marvelous name--is a vision of sylvan beauty as Kahu a Maori girl who makes her entrance on horseback. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" which was based on a book by Barry Crump called ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" has its share of misfired jokes and pseudo-mythic sequences that semi-fizzle. All in all though its majestical nonsense that is anything but nonsensical. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download Boy (2010) In Taika Waititis second feature as a director the 11-year-old hero is played engagingly by James Rolleston. The time is 1984. The setting is a poor Maori community on the east coast of New Zealands North Island. Its the town where Mr. Waititi grew up and he plays Boys father a goony stoner and scuzzy crook who has come home after years of absence to dig up a bag of money hed buried in a nearby field. 94 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The film has already broken box office records in its native New Zealand. Its a bit too tame to catch fire here in the same way however despite writer-director Taika Waititis growing track record as a cult comedy hero. The mischief starts with Ricky (Julian Dennison) an overweight undisciplined 13-year-old Maori boy whos blazed through a series of foster homes and reached the end of the line. Hes taken under the wing of an older couple Bella (Rima Te Wiata) who wins the young man over with unrelenting sweetness and Hec (Sam Neill) who hunts critters in the woods and wants nothing to do with this obnoxious kid. At first Hecs position seems reasonable Ricky is a poorly defined character introduced to us as a little hellion whos terrorized half the country before pulling an abrupt 180 in the first ten minutes and becoming a haiku-writing softie whos only looking for love. When a series of events causes Ricky and Hec to set off into the wild some slightly off-color male bonding ensues. Movies Director Taika Waititis Wilderpeople Is Good For A Laugh -- And Then A Cry Neill makes for a pretty great crusty outcast even if he isnt given much to do beyond the broadest outlines of an outdoorsman persona. The chemistry between him and Dennison helps propel the story as the two are chased The Fugitive-style by a relentless figure from social services played by the great Rachel House. ""Im the Terminator and youre Sarah Connor"" she barks at Ricky from the other side of a gorge in possibly the least threatening smack talk ever. Because the authorities suspect kidnapping or worse Ricky and Hec are forced to stick it out in the bush hunting for food as back in civilization their legend grows. (The films title comes from Rickys comment that he and Hec are engaged in a lengthy state of migration like the wildebeest.) Tonally Wilderpeople is more in line with Waititis earlier character-based humorous narratives Boy and Eagle Vs. Shark than his howlingly funny vampire mockumentary What We Do In The Shadows. Shadows was a laugh-delivery machine; this one based on the childrens novel Wild Pork and Watercress by New Zealand author Barry Crump takes itself slightly more seriously. But theres still a healthy dose of the familiar Kiwi deadpan we know from stuff like Flight of the Conchords (which makes sense as Waititi directed several episodes). Ricky names his dog ""Tupac"" thinks every conflict should end in a blaze of gunfire and is horrified when his sweet dotty ""aunt"" suddenly whips out a bush knife and slaughters a deer. And Rhys Darby a master of character-based comedy gets a grade-A cameo as a nutty survivalist whos terrified of filling out government forms. Theres nothing new in Waititis treatment of characters like these and the staging of more fast-paced moments -- like a climactic Mad Max-style car chase -- is too awkward to be exciting. But the films subject offers an ideal opportunity to bask in nice crane shots of the countrys untamed beauty. Theres something charming about a lo-fi approach to New Zealand after the last decade-plus of big-budget grandeur via the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit series. It reminds us that even when youre not pretending the country is some glamorous magical kingdom--well it still kind of is. Waititi is next set to direct the third entry in Marvels Thor films a series of epically bland proportions that (even by Marvel standards) hasnt been especially kind to any distinct directorial vision. But perhaps if we suddenly see the Norse God hunting wild boar in the woods well know something of the directors individual spirit has prevailed.

"Sam Neill anchors Hunt for the Wilderpeople a hilarious touching New Zealand odyssey - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Sam Neill anchors Hunt for the Wilderpeople a hilarious touching New Zealand odyssey Hunt For The Wilderpeople The Orchard via AP Sam Neill left and Julian Dennison in a scene from Hunt For The Wilderpeople. Sam Neill left and Julian Dennison in a scene from Hunt For The Wilderpeople. (The Orchard via AP) Kenneth Turan Every once in a while a small unheralded film comes along so smart and funny such a pleasure to experience you cant believe your luck. ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is such a film.The wacky story of the way-unlikely alliance between an overweight reprobate of a teenager and a surly wilderness loving loner ""Wilderpeople"" was written and directed by New Zealands Taika Waititi whose last credit was the admired vampire mockumentary ""What We Do in the Shadows."" ""Wilderpeople"" was a surprise audience favorite at Sundance where everyone who mentioned it smiled at the memory and with good reason. The film has a gently absurdist quality a simultaneously sweet and subversive sensibility all its own mixing warmth adventure and comedy in ways that consistently surprise.Much of this tone comes from the novel ""Wilderpeople"" is based on ""Wild Pork and Watercress"" by Barry Crump an idiosyncratic author so beloved in New Zealand he has sold more than a million books in a 4-million-person country. (Crumps one-of-a-kind New Zealand TV spots for Toyota four-wheel-drive vehicles available on YouTube made him even more of a national figure before his death in 1996.) The combination of Crumps sensibility Waititis growing stature as a filmmaker and an irresistible story persuaded some of New Zealands top actors starting with the veteran Sam Neill letter-perfect as unbending outdoorsman Hec Faulkner to take roles in the picture.But ""Wilderpeople"" wouldnt be the success it is without its 13-year-old costar Julian Dennison. A talented performer in only his third feature Dennison creates a convincingly multidimensional character whose personal unpredictability and sincere spontaneity is never in doubt. SNAP Video Official Australian trailer for Hunt for the Wilderpeople Official Australian trailer for Hunt for the Wilderpeople See more videos ""Wilderpeople"" opens deep in the New Zealand bush with a police car headed for a remote isolated cabin. In the back seat is sullen overweight Ricky Baker (Dennison) a city kid far from home and about to get farther.Taking Baker to the latest in a long string of foster homes are a policeman named Andy (Oscar Kightley) and officious Paula Hall (Rachel House) of Child Welfare who ominously describes Ricky as ""a bit of a handful a real bad egg."" Having no such qualms is new foster mother Bella Faulkner (Rima Te Wiata) overflowing with enthusiasm and good spirits who promptly gives the suspicious Ricky a hug as big as all outdoors.Bellas husband Hec is something else entirely. First glimpsed toting home an enormous wild boar hes killed Hec favors Ricky with a look that could freeze molten steel and asks ""Ever worked on a farm before or are you just ornamental?"" Hecs disdain notwithstanding it becomes clear that Ricky is not a bad boy just neglected. He may say things like ""Im a menace to society"" but his fondness for hot water bottles (essential for nighttime warmth in the outback) gives him away.Things start to look promising for Ricky on his 13th birthday. He gets a dog (which he promptly names Tupac) and a song written in his honor by Bella proclaiming him ""once neglected now accepted.""Suddenly through no fault of his own everything changes for Ricky. Child Welfare wants him back and while Ricky ever the gangster hopes for ""a shootout like Scarface"" Hec plans to disappear into the bush. By himself. Ricky says they could be a team on the run but Hec contemptuously tells him ""You wouldnt last five minutes out there.""  Though its hardly a shock that circumstances amusingly conspire to make this teaming happen the wild and crazy comic plot twists misadventures and misunderstandings that befall this duo manage to be as unexpected as they are amusing. Which is a lot. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Essential in this is the utter conviction the two stars bring to characters who really do not have much use for each other. Neills performance is the rock that anchors everything and Dennison is especially good at revealing the unlooked-for aspects of Ricky like his fondness for writing haiku and his precocious familiarity with psychological jargon like ""youre still processing.""Director Waititi who has an amusing cameo as a minister and whose improbable follow-up will be the Marvel behemoth ""Thor Ragnarok"" is at the heart of ""Wilderpeoples"" success. He not only casually blends entertainment and emotional resonance he makes creating something both site specific and universal look like the easiest task of all.===MPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements including violent content and for some language.

When it works it really works. When it doesnt well the crickets can be deafening. His latest the Kiwi coming-of-age comedy Hunt for the Wilderpeople falls somewhere in between. Best known for his work on HBOs brilliant Flight of the Conchords and his sharp 2015 vampire spoof What We Do in the Shadows Waititi has earned enough fans in high places that he was recently handed a gigantic sack of Marvel money to make the next Thor installment which should definitely be interesting if nothing else. In the meantime theres the off-kilter tale of Ricky Baker--a round smart-ass wannabe gangsta (played by Julian Dennison) who moves in with a foster family deep in the bush and winds up on the lam from Child Services with his Crocodile Dundee-like ""uncle"" (Sam Neill behind a shaggy beard). Dennison juggles foulmouthed brattiness and sweet sincerity well enough and Neill soars as a gruff outdoorsman hiding a soft chewy center. But the film is maddeningly uneven. Just as it starts to settle into an inspired groove it uncorks a couple of gags that fall lethally flat making for half of a great comedy.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Eyebrows were raised last fall when New Zealand filmmaker Taika Waititi was announced as the director of next years Thor Ragnarok. Unlike previous Thor directors Kenneth Branagh and Alan Taylor whod both had at least some experience directing action sequences (in Henry V and on Game Of Thrones respectively) Waititi is known exclusively for small gentle comedies often in collaboration with Flight Of The Conchords Jemaine Clement. (The two co-directed last years What We Do In The Shadows.) How hell fare with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is anybodys guess but there arent many clues to be found in Hunt For The Wilderpeople an enjoyably goofy adventure that manages to bring some freshness to the moldy ""cantankerous adult reluctantly bonds with adorable kid"" subgenre. Starring Sam Neill as the cantankerous adult the film plays a bit like Jurassic Park minus Lex and dinosaurs mining humor from the incongruity of its odd-couple pairing and basic fish-out-of-water elements plus some Conchord-ish wit.As adorable movie kids go Ricky (Julian Dennison) is an acquired taste very much by design. As the film begins a stern social worker (Rachel House) is dropping him off at the latest in a long series of foster families with the warning that hell be sent to a juvenile detention center if he screws up this last chance. Fortunately Bella (Rima Te Wiata) his new foster mother is a wellspring of unconditional love more than offsetting the surliness of her husband Hec (Neill). When a sudden tragedy threatens to send Ricky back into bureaucratic limbo however the boy fakes his suicide and flees into the woods abutting Bella and Hecs farm. It doesnt take long for Hec to track Ricky down but the two wind up camping for longer than intended after Hec breaks his foot leaving him temporarily unable to walk. A subsequent misunderstanding turns the pair into wanted fugitives relentlessly pursued by Rickys social worker who likens herself to the Terminator. ""No Im like the Terminator"" Ricky insists. ""I said it first"" argues the social worker. ""Youre more like Sarah Connor. And in the first film before she could do chin-ups.""That exchange could easily have been spoken by Bret and Jemaine on Flight Of The Conchords (several episodes of which Waititi wrote and/or directed) and Hunt For The Wilderpeople works best when it straddles the same line between mild hostility and equally mild affection. (It also provides a cameo for Rhys Darby--best known for playing the Conchords manager Murray--as a crazed hermit Ricky and Hec encounter.) The film does sometimes play more like a series of loosely related sketches than like a narrative and it occasionally veers into maudlin sentimentality. Dennison is a real find though pulling off the tricky task of making Ricky at once likable and exasperating. Even the many fat jokes tossed his way come across as good-natured ribbing rather than cruelty thanks to Dennisons sheer self-confidence. Waititi for his part demonstrates enough facility with a slightly larger budget--an armed confrontation toward the end of the film features crack timing albeit geared toward comedy--to suggest that Marvel may know something that we as yet do not. Jon Favreau seemed an unlikely choice once too.

Area Theaters. Serious Australian thespian Sam Neill may be the biggest name in the charming homegrown New Zealand action-comedy ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" but its his younger co-star who steals the movie. Julian Dennison plays 13-year-old Ricky Baker an unwanted foster kid constantly getting himself into trouble until hes brought to live with the Faulkners a couple who live out in the middle of nowhere. Bella (Rima Te Wiata) is a loving woman ready to care for Ricky but her husband Hec (Sam Neill) is a grouchy frontiersman who has little time or patience for their new ward. A sudden tragedy forces Ricky to run away from his new home but when he gets lost in the Bush -- the vast wilderness surrounding the Faulkners home -- Hec goes after him only to get injured himself. With the two of them missing Rickys nemesis (Rachel House) a tough head of child welfare services who takes her job way too seriously presumes Hec kidnapped the boy. The chase is on as Ricky and Hec unwittingly become national heroes -- and notorious outlaws. Filmmaker Taika Waititi is mostly known for his work with fellow Kiwi Jemaine Clement (""What We Do in the Shadows"") but ""Hunt"" is very much his own passion project. Although adapted from a Barry Crump novel not well known outside of New Zealand it still maintains all the charm and personality of Waititis earlier work. Amy Schumer axes gun scene in new movie after Orlando attack Even before ""Hunt"" premiered at Sundance Waititi had been hired by Marvel Studios to direct 2017s ""Thor Ragnarok"" which just makes ""Hunt"" that much more special as his last New Zealand flick for a while. The best thing the director has going for this one is the talented young actor playing Ricky Baker as he constantly tries to emulate his tough ""gangsta"" heroes like Tupac Shakur. (He even names his dog ""Tupac."") Its such a fun character especially watching how irritated Hec gets at him with Neill playing the straight man of the duo. Along the way they also meet lots of strange and equally funny characters including an unrecognizable Rhys Darby (""Flight of the Conchords"") as an amicable nutcase named ""Psycho Sam."" Julian Dennison and Sam Neill hit their mrks Hunt for the Wilderpeople (The Orchard) As much as young Julian Tennison is likely to capture your heart as Ricky Baker Daily News 2016 summer movie guide Rachel House -- a popular actress in New Zealand -- is often funnier by how far she takes Paulas unrealistic efforts to save Ricky from his ""kidnapper."" ""No child left behind"" is her misguided motto and shell do whatever it takes to put Ricky with a proper family even if it means chasing him across the wilds of the bush along with military personnel and even tanks. Possibly the most amazing thing about ""Hunt"" -- besides its quirky and distinctive sense of humor -- is how it starts off like a seemingly fairly small and intimate tale of a teenage boy adjusting to his foster family then builds into a last act that even has some impressive car stunts. Throw in a few ""Rambo"" ""Terminator"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" references --the latter even funnier when you realize how Waititi has been working in the shadow of Peter Jackson for years -- and you end up with a fun boys action-adventure flick on par with some of the best. With its safe PG-13 rating ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" is also the type of movie that could easily win the heart of any 11- to 14-year-old boy who will likely relate Ricky Baker. Its a wonderful slice of New Zealand-bred humor that should have a far wider appeal than Waititis previous films. More importantly it gives Waititi one last hometown hurrah before hes elevated to directing Hollywood blockbusters hopefully bringing all the wit and talent he displays here along with him.

TWITTER Taika Waititis adaptation of Barry Crumps Wild Pork and Watercress stars Sam Neill and Julian Dennison. A hard-to-handle foster kid from the big city and a grouchy bushman in his sixties are forced to forge an unlikely alliance to survive in the New Zealand wilderness in Hunt for the Wilderpeople a deliciously good time at the movies. An adaptation of Wild Pork and Watercress from the late and legendary New Zealand outdoorsman and novelist Barry Crumb this familiar but perfectly balanced blend of drama and comedy action and heart was directed by actor-director Taika Waititi known for his work on projects such as the vampire mockumentary What We Do In the Shadows and also the director of the upcoming Thor Ragnarok. Based on the evidence here that hire was a brilliant move on Marvels part as Waititi is fully in command of Wilderpeople his biggest and most ambitious film to date. With Kiwi legend Sam Neill and impressive local up-and-comer Julian Dennison (Shopping Paper Planes) headlining the proceedings this should again do solid business at home -- where Waititis 2010 feature Boy remains the highest-grossing local film of all time -- while also exciting distributors further afield. The film kicks off with the delivery of rotund and taciturn 13-year-old Ricky Baker (Dennison) at a dilapidated cottage in the middle of the New Zealand bush. As explained by a barking employee of Child Welfare Paula (Rachel House) Ricky who has changed homes frequently has a history of getting into trouble. However his new adoptive mother Bella (Rima Te Wiata) isnt concerned in the slightest not even after hes run away during his first night in his new home telling him to come back in for breakfast before continuing his escape. Waititi is most famous internationally for his comedic work -- which besides Shadows also includes work on Flight of the Concords -- and his nimble adaptation here combines solid writing with an entire bag of filmmaking tricks that includes visual gags unexpected cuts and quick montage sequences to score laughs from the get-go. He also cleverly exploits who these people are to get the audience in stitches. In all films except for childish comedies it would considered bad taste to make jokes about the fact Rickys overweight for example. Here they are placed in the mouth of the no-nonsense yet big-hearted countrywoman Bella and its hard not to crack up and be touched at the same time since they come across as terms of endearment from someone with a tough-as-nails tell-it-like-it-is worldview. (Te Wiatas carefully calibrated performance has a lot to do with finding the right tone as well.) Similarly Rickys incongruous interest in haikus to express his feelings which he seems to have picked up from one of the no-doubt countless shrinks hes been forced to see in his recent past is used simultaneously as a source of humor and character information with a few of them neatly (if also somewhat predictably) woven into the films final stretch. The bulk of the story takes place after Bellas suddenly exits the picture and Ricky is forced to escape into the bush with Bellas partner the scruffy curmudgeon Hector or Hec (Neill). As in all mismatched buddy stories the sixtysomething doesnt like his 13-year-old new charge very much though the kid insists they escape into the bush together since otherwise hell be forced to go to juvie. Indeed the two are polar opposites in more ways than one Apart from the differences in age and experience Ricky is a city slicker while Hec is a real outdoors expert as the costumes (by Kristin Seth) also keep reminding us with the boys new and colorful hoodie baseball jacket and cap standing in stark contrast to Hecs much more practical camouflage-colored and lived-in gear. Hecs experience in this field will allow them to survive for months in the countrys virginal forests while they hide from the increasingly large man- and childhunt led by Paula the local police and eventually the military. Even when Hector fractures his foot and cant walk properly for several weeks they manage to survive because he instructs Ricky in the ways of the bush. This leads to quite a few comic setpieces as the boy whos appalled at the idea of having to survive without toilet paper tries to get the hang of how to live in the forest. The Hunt for the Wilderpeople -- the title comes from Ricky likening the duo to wildebeests known for their long treks -- is divided into novelistic chapters with titles such as ""The Bad Egg"" or ""Broken Foot Camp"". They not only help recall the films source material but also help to further infuse their journey with something epic as it suggests many other chapters were left out for this condensed version of events. Along the way Waititi alternates moments of action including some ferocious wild pig action (courtesy of The Lord of the Rings FX company Weta); countless moments of humor (a highlight is their stay with the off-the-grid-living Psycho Sam played by Rhys Darby) and also touching moments of drama including a nighttime conversation in a bunk bed thats played just right staying miles away from syrupy sentiment even as the two men allow themselves to shed some light on their feelings. A chapter called ""War"" was no-doubt something Marvel looked at before handing Waititi the reins of their Thor franchise and he handles the large-scale action sequences here with aplomb always respecting spatial coherence while making sure the proceedings also contain a certain wow-factor. But finally what makes Wilderpeople memorable is how attached audiences become to the characters and as played by  Dennison and Neill they are two fully realized full of flaws but nonetheless oh-so loveable human beings.

Reminiscent of Rushmore and Moonrise Kingdom Waititis follow-up to last years vampire-reality-show comedy What We Do in the Shadows is a deranged coming-of-age adventure about a young delinquent prone to expressing himself via haiku.Ricky (Julian Dennison) an overweight foster kid with thug-life aspirations is compelled by child protective services Paula (Rachel House) to live with cheery farmer Bella (Rima Te Wiata) and her gruff husband Hec (Sam Neill) -- Hec first appears carrying a hog on his back as Paulas cop escort remarks ""Hes giving that pig a piggyback"" Ricky quickly warms to Bella thanks partly to the hot-water bottle she sticks in his bed every night. However no sooner has he accepted her as his new ""auntie"" -- and received a dog from her that he dubs ""Tupac"" -- than she dies leaving him alone with scruffy surly Hec desperate to avoid re-entering the foster system.Film DetailsCritics Pick Hunt for the Wilderpeople RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time101 min. Showing Today In3 Theaters More Info Trailer Ricky fakes his own death and flees into the bush and he and Hec considered fugitives soon become national news items (complete with Hec slandered as a ""pervert""). Much hunting chasing bickering and bonding ensues and while Waititis tale (based on Barry Crumpss novel Wild Pork and Watercress) is destined for an upbeat ending the path it charts to that conclusion is uniquely strange told with crossfades off-kilter compositions random fantasy sequences deadpan edits and a cheeky Eighties-style synth score. The picturesque material becomes downright dreamlike.Neil proves compellingly gruff as a reluctant father figure though its the trash-talking family-craving ten-year-old Dennison who steals the show exuding a wacko wounded attitude rooted in Rickys backwoods Rambo-Scarface-Mad Max reveries. Hunt for the Wilderpeople elevates its sentimental formula through weird wonderful personality plus amusing one-liners from not only its leads but a paranoid psycho (Rhys Darby) and an odd pastor (Waititi delivering the funniest funeral sermon in recent memory).By contrast theres practically no compelling life present in Haute Cuisine director Christian Vincents Courted. This French import details a court case -- about a man accused of kicking his seven-month-old daughter to death -- presided over by a judge named Racine (Fabrice Luchini) whos loathed by his colleagues. Flu-plagued and irritable Racine is disarmed when one of the jurors turns out to be Ditte (Sidse Babett Knudsen) an anesthesiologist who cared for him after he was injured in an accident years earlier -- and with whom he fell madly in love.Their rekindled relationship turns out to be a go-nowhere plot strand but its no more tiresome than the rest of the visually inert Courted a drama superficially engaged with issues of perception (mainly via lots of judgmental chatter about how people are dressed) while proving primarily concerned with having numerous figures explain in great detail the logistics of the French legal system. Its an informational civics lesson masquerading as an actual movie.Hunt for the WilderpeopleDirected by Taika Waititi Playing April 20-22 at the Tribeca Film Festival Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Schager Follow nschager Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
