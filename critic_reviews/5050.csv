The acting too is mostly superb especially Gordon-Levitt in a tricky often unsympathetic lead role.Elsewhere 50/50 runs into trouble Jonathan Levines direction is sitcom-flat and the soundtrack is stuffed with predictable indie whinge-rock from the likes of Radiohead and Pearl Jam. Most damaging of all the films female characters run the gamut of misogynist cliche Anna Kendrick is sympathetic but non-threatening as the love interest while the treatment of Adams flighty unsupportive ex-girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) develops from dismissive to vicious a bitter streak also reflected in Rogens bullish unlikeable turn and a shrill throwaway appearance by Angelica Huston as Adams flappy mum.So on the one hand there are a brace of memorable one-liners some powerhouse performing and an infectious sense of joie de vivre in the face of extreme duress; on the other a sad lack of cinematic ambition and some shady gender politics. 50/50 is about right.

Its the only movie that has made me go directly from laughing to sobbing (I cried Ill admit it) and thats all you can ask of a movie. Contrary to the critics review I thought Anna Kendrick was absolutely fantastic and while we do agree about the movie making his ex a stereotypical wicked witch type person I think it would have made the movie to crowded and a little to heavy if they tried to fully develop her character. Seth Rogan adds some much needed comedy and Adams Mom really helps the movie hit on an emotional level.

Friends all react in different ways; so I cant understand the negative Seth Rogen comments. Im not his biggest fan but watching him try to handle the situation via escapism and deflection mirrored many of my own experiences. Ignore the comments about this being a Hollywood treatment of cancer. It isnt. It gives a terrible subject a light hearted balance by adding humour whats so wrong about that? Surely its better to prepare for death with a smile on your face enjoying what your remaining life has to offer. All in all great music great acting and a fine film.

Apart from the girlfriend all the characters have their positive and negative qualities. Even Seth Rogan has questionable motives. That debate aside no one has mentioned the emotional depth of the film which is achieved without resorting to melodrama. This is a funny and quietly touching film. I had no problem with the music.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 22 2011DCFeaturedUnsure where the mysogynist hang up stems from. Do all films need to strike a healthy gender balance? Can this not be this characters experience? Can this flawed reaction not be this mans way of dealing with the double blow of cancer and infidelity? It wasnt the ""correct"" reaction to have and neither in was it healthy for he and his counsellor to get together but I liked that the film didnt try to mask the emotional confusion and dizziness cancer can cause. Review of reviews aside; it was a lovely watch well scripted well performed and well directed. It had its flaws but managed to pack a mainstream emotional punch in a year where the mainstream largely failed to deliver.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 9 2011PaulFeaturedAfter first seeing Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the wonderful Mysterious Skin I always make a point of seeing his films and this has to be the most disappointing.

While waiting for a stoplight to turn green he reflexively reaches behind him to rub a sore muscle in his back. But its not just a temporary ache. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) soon learns that he has a rare form of cancer on his spine. His prognosis isnt great maybe 50/50 at best. Hell have to undergo radiation to shrink the tumor and then a risky operation to remove it. Adam is 27. Thats the set up for ""50/50"" a modest comic drama that is one of this falls surprise pleasures. The film shows matter-of-factly and with a healthy dose of humor how Adam deals with the situation and how his family girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) best buddy (Seth Rogen) and colleagues do as well. The film is loosely based on first-time screenwriter Will Reisers own bout with the disease. Given that he wrote this movie viewers will know ahead of time theres a better than 50/50 chance that things will end well. Unlike so many other cancer and deadly disease movies ""50/50"" isnt about watching an ill protagonist check items off a bucket list find true love just before breathing his last or becoming noble through illness. (Decades ago when Mad magazine parodied ""Love Story"" it said the movies bedridden heroine suffered from Movie Star Disease explaining ""Thats when you get more and more beautiful and then you die."") Rather ""50/50"" is about Adam having the rotten luck to get cancer and then deal with it as best he can coping along the way with the good the bad and the funny. In the movie as in life the people around him react in various ways to his disease. His girlfriend tries to be supportive but its just not in her. His bumbling best buddy is there for Adam but isnt above using his pals cancer as a surefire pick-up line with girls. His over-protective mother (a lovely turn by Anjelica Huston) would be there 24/7 if he would let her even as she copes with caring for Adams father whos fast disappearing into dementia. And theres also a charmingly bumbling tyro therapist (Anna Kendrick) whos helping Adam to talk through his illness issues. Its a mark of the movies gentle approach and sticking to the way things are rather than the way we would want them to be that theres a scene late in ""50/50"" in which Adams parents visit him in the hospital on the morning of his surgery. Its a tricky operation and he could easily die on the table or end up paralyzed. But in the scene while his mother sheds tears and hugs him his out-of-it father rather than having a sudden dramatic moment of lucidity or saying something crazy but also poignantly to the point instead proudly boasts to Adam that the new jacket hes wearing is from Brooks Brothers. Its a moment so bittersweet it breaks your heart. Director Jonathan Levine (""The Wackness"") finds a rhythm that works for the movie mostly going for comedy but giving the dramatic moments their due. Gordon-Levitt continues to impress as a leading man of depth and wry comic flair (whod have thunk it when he was just that weird looking little kid on TVs ""3rd Rock from the Sun""?) and Kendrick and Rogan are sprightly fun. Add ""50/50"" to your want to see list. And then make an appointment for your annual physical with your doctor. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

R. 1 hour 40 minutes. Opens today at area theaters. When it come to keeping tabs on impressive on-screen younguns there are your followers of Ryan Gosling. Your trackers of Mia Wasikowska. Your forever Anne Hathaway hopefuls. Us? We root for all the above but count ourselves among the longtime fans of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The dark-haired actor who long ago put away childhood roles stars along with Seth Rogen in the cancer dramedy ""50/50"" opening today. Gordon-Levitt portrays Adam Lerner who learns he has cancer. And his performance is the surest thing in a film that has telling and amusing moments but doesnt shake off a few too-obvious gestures. Lerner 27 is a doggedly dedicated producer at a National Public Radio station. Hes the sort of guy so full of fret that had this diagnosis not occurred hed have imagined it for himself. The title refers to the survival rate of Adams particular cancer. Now he has something real to worry about. And so too do his loved ones. Adams artist girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) struggles but is ill-equipped emotionally to do right by her ailing beau. Best friend Kyle (Rogen) proves that in friendship as in romance opposites attract. Adam is level-headed. Kyle is boneheaded. Kyles initial efforts at comfort find him coaching Adam to use his cancer as a pickup line. Evidently potentially mortal illness is even more effective than a puppy with the ladies. Will Reiser wrote the script which is inspired by his own bout with cancer. Rogen and Evan Goldberg produced ""5 0/50."" The pair wrote with Reiser for HBOs ""Da Ali G Show."" And Rogen would be the first to admit that once they learned Reiser had been diagnosed with cancer they werent particularly deft at handling the news. The vexing problem with ""5 0/50"" is how poorly it deals with the medical profession. An oncologist is not believable in his indifference as he delivers Adams initial diagnosis. An anesthesiologist is pushy at a moment that requires sensitivity. Still the grandest --and most cliched-- abuse of the medical profession comes in the depiction of Adams therapist. Likeable Anna Kendrick plays Katherine with her typical fast-talking finesse. But a film that trusted the smarts of its audience wouldnt make her falter so much. Anjelica Huston dodges being a cutout hysterical mom modulating her narcissism with a resurgent clarity. Still its Gordon-Levitts choices that continue to impress. Sure he owned one of the most jaw-dropping sequences in last summers blockbuster ""Inception"" (floating in the hotel hallways and an elevator). But the actor remains drawn to profoundly human-scale hurts and quiet triumphs. In ""5 0/50"" he makes the case that little speaks to human vulnerability quite like a cancer diagnosis with its daunting treatments and worrisome odds.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 30 2011 Save for later Saved Joseph Gordon-Levitt (l.) and Seth Rogen are shown in a scene from the new movie 50/50. Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Making comedy out of tragedy is not quite as difficult as it sounds since most good comedy is rooted in seriousness. ""50/50"" starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a cancer patient and Seth Rogen as his best buddy tries to lighten the heavy and presumably make tragedy more bearable. At least thats the game plan. The high proportion of sitcom-ish humor to genuine laughs - about 70/30 Id say - undercuts the films best intentions. Its a genial movie about terror. But some real feeling does occasionally push through the synthetic situations. Perhaps thats because the screenplay by Will Reiser is semiautobiographical.Adam Lerner (Gordon-Levitt) works in Seattle for NPR and discovers to his astonishment that the pain he has been experiencing in his back is caused by a rare cancer attached to his spinal column. Kyle (Rogen) tries his best to cheer his friend up. Misfit that he is he also tries to parlay Adams condition into luring women for sympathy sex. This comes after Adams girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) in a role that is too demonically drawn proves less than true-blue. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Jonathan Levine keeps the blubbery factor at a minimum - perhaps to a fault. Whenever a moment of palpable fear obtrudes rest assured it wont be long before Kyle or somebody is dousing the damage. Rogen is often very funny although it would be helpful if he didnt always act like he knew he was funny. Better or at least less blatant are the comedic moments involving Adam in his chemotherapy sessions with two crusty oldsters sympathetically played by Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer. The byplay in their scenes together has an offhanded grace underscoring the mens fortitude. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gordon-Levitt is an agreeably undemonstrative actor who plays well opposite the burbly Rogen. (Theyre like a comedy team classically mismatched physically and emotionally.) He also scores in his scenes with Anjelica Huston as Adams mother Diane. Huston turns what might have been an overbearing cartoon into something much more than that. Shes overbearing all right but you can also see the care and the fright and the love that propels her concern. Great actresses have a way of pulling the truth out of even the hoariest cliches.Less successful are the scenes between Adam and his therapist Katherine played by Anna Kendrick in what sometimes looks like a recap of her role as the uptight fussbudget in ""Up in the Air."" We know these two will eventually hook up just as we know Adams girlfriend will prove unfaithful or that not all of his chemo cohorts will make it. The films predictability dampens its best parts. Having decided to make a movie about a dreaded subject the filmmakers too often retreat into the comfort zone of easy assurances and flip quips. Grade B- (Rated R for language throughout sexual content and some drug use.)

"50/50 reviewed Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen as pals vs. spinal cancer. Slate Sign In Sign Up Catcher in the MRI Joseph Gordon-Levitt Fights Cancer in 50/50 Catcher in the MRI Joseph Gordon-Levitt Fights Cancer in 50/50 Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 30 2011 204 PM Catcher in the MRI Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a young man with spinal cancer in 50/50. By Dana Stevens Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 50/50 Photo byChris Helcermanas-Benge- (c)2011 Summit Entertainment LLC. All Rights Reserved. Read Slates ""Interrogation"" of 50/50 star Anjelica Huston. Jonathan Levines last movie was The Wackness (2008) an uneven but charming coming-of-age comedy about a rap-obsessed pot-dealing teenager contending with crazy parents and a crazier shrink in the summer of 1994. Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the hero of Levines new film is dealing with a situation thats even more wack At age 27 hes been diagnosed with an unpronounceable form of spinal cancer that gives him only a 50 percent chance of survival. Advertisement Adam is a guarded opaque sort inclined to play down his illness with mild irony. He blows off the constant phone calls from his understandably freaked-out mother (Anjelica Huston in a small but outstanding role) whos also struggling with a husband in the late stages of dementia. Adams girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) on the other hand seems curiously disconnected from the reality that the man she loves may be dying--she declines to accompany him past the hospital doors citing ""bad energy"" in a way that tips us off shes bad news. But at least Adam has Kyle (Seth Rogen) who gives him a ride every day to the Seattle public radio station where they both work. (Adam himself doesnt drive which becomes an important plot detail without ever being adequately explored as a character trait. Why doesnt he have a license? Is he fearful scatterbrained ecologically minded or just broke?) Kyle is a horny stoner doofus--an only slightly more nuanced variation on the classic Rogen role--but hes as loyal as a St. Bernard and when he learns his friend is sick hes all in offering to drive Adam to chemotherapy appointments and get him laid in between (using Adams true-life sob story as a surefire chick magnet). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Adams hospital visits introduce him to a few sympathetic souls Theres Alan (Philip Baker Hall) a cancer patient in his 70s who generously shares his medical-marijuana-laced macaroons; and Katherine (Anna Kendrick) a nervous young psychology student who offers Adam therapy sessions as part of her thesis project. Adam and Katherines stop-and-start flirtation makes for some of the movies most darkly funny scenes as her textbook bromides (""I just want you to know what youre feeling is perfectly normal"") shrivel in the heat of his repressed rage. But Katherines not the only one who fails to get to the bottom of what Adams feeling For the majority of the movie this quiet sardonic young man remains impenetrable to the audience too. Gordon-Levitt a generous and versatile actor rarely gets the chance to play anything beyond stoic repression--until a late powerful scene in which awaiting a major medical procedure he clings to his mother with undisguised infantile need. Levine and the scriptwriter Will Reiser (who based the story in part on his own experience as a cancer patient) labor mightily to find both the drama and the comedy in Adams awful plight with a success rate thats slightly greater than the ratio of the films title. Scene by scene 50/50 can be both amusing and moving with the tightly wound Gordon-Levitt and the boundaryless Rogen forming an oddly complementary pair. But as a whole the movie never quite coheres seeming to skitter away at the last minute from both full-body laughter and full-body sobs. ""Did you see Terms of Endearment?"" Adam asks his mother moments before he tells her he has cancer. The line gets a laugh because presumably of the distance between that movies Hollywood vision of a family brought closer by cancer and this movies rawer realer version. But the sprawling occasionally operatic Terms of Endearment felt more honest than this cautious and tidy film. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Suppose it starred indie heartthrob Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the guy diagnosed with cancer -- and Up in the Airs perky Anna Kendrick as his inexperienced counselor. Would that make it more appealing? Throw in Seth Rogen as the faintly obnoxious but wisecracking best friend. More or less? I ask because 50/50 -- the movie not the odds of success -- is likely to strike many people as enormously appealing once theyve seen it but substantially less so beforehand. And for anyone feeling affirmatively about it the question arises as to what might conceivably put butts in seats. Its sort of a given that The Big C wont. 50/50 features Gordon-Levitt as Adam a 27-year-old producer for Seattle Public Radio (thats definitely appealing no?) who in the films early moments is told he has a rare form of spinal cancer and has a roughly even chance of surviving. He confides this to best buddy Kyle (Rogen) whos initially panicked but knows he should buck up his friend and seizes on the probability of survival. ""50/50"" he sighs feigning relief ""If you were a casino game youd have the best odds."" Adam whos the sort of guy who waits patiently at Dont Walk signs and doesnt drive because auto accidents are the fifth-leading cause of death in the U.S. is so blindsided by his diagnosis that hes perfectly willing to be led in upbeat directions. He nods his acquiescence to Kyles assessment and tries to get on with a life that will now involve chemo hair loss and plenty of hash brownies. i Shock And Aw-Shucks Adams best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) bucks him up with black comedy -- and a trip to the bar to troll for babes. Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Summit Entertainment Shock And Aw-Shucks Adams best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) bucks him up with black comedy -- and a trip to the bar to troll for babes. Chris Helcermanas-Benge/Summit Entertainment Kyle meanwhile seizes on secondary probabilities Whether Adams fair-weather girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) last two weeks once she knows about his illness? Whether telling bar babes that Adam has cancer will be a good pick-up line for either of them? Whether ... well you get the drift. Sitcom-ish sure but with more than a germ of plausibility not least because 50/50 was based by screenwriter Will Reiser on his own early-20s diagnosis with spinal cancer which he received while working with Rogen who was a writer on TVs Da Ali G Show. In interviews both speak of how the diagnosis affected their relationship and in the film theyve turned the awkwardness between Adam and Kyle into an effective hook. Its not really what drives the movie but it earns audience buy-in after which Gordon-Levitt can do his impressively nuanced thing walking an emotional tightrope in a film that initially seems too interested in laughs to be all that concerned with delicacy. In fact at first youll worry that the films entire support-group dynamic will get skewed by Rogens noisily outsized performance. But it turns out theres still room at the storys edges for Adams needy self-dramatizing mom (a terrific if underused Anjelica Huston) who wants to move in with her son and who finds other ways to make his problems her problems when he says no to that. Also room for hospital therapist Katherine (Kendrick appealingly awkward) who realizes that shes developing a crush on her patient -- Adam is only her third case and she hasnt yet figured out how not to sound scripted -- at about the moment he shifts from acquiescence to anger and starts to become a bit of a jerk. Its this entirely realistic if dramatically unorthodox twist that finally puts vinegar in a story thats been threatening to go all treacly on director Jonathan (The Wackness) Levine. Where most disease-of-the-week tales end up giving their sickly characters a saintly glow this one realizes that the smarter tack is to keep him human -- letting him bristle with cynicism and lash out as his support group concentrates on his inner sweetheart. In other hands Adam might well be hard to take. But as the comedy in 50/50 turns darker Gordon-Levitt whos maybe the most natural least affected actor of his generation makes prickly plenty engaging. What were the odds?

Chris Helcermanas-Benge In this film image released by Summit Entertainment Joseph Gordon-Levitt left and Seth Rogen are shown in a scene from ""50/50."" (AP Photo/Summit EntertainmentChris Helcermanas-Benge) 50/50"" is a dicey proposition. It wrings comedy from cancer and surrounds its saintly protagonist with sickly stereotypes. But the closer it gets to the mortal abyss the more it feels real and revealing. Thats a tribute to Will Reiser who wrote the script after recovering from cancer; to his friend Seth Rogen who produced and co-stars in the movie; and to Joseph Gordon-Levitt who adds dark layers to a character who starts so opaque.Adam (Gordon-Levitt) is such a meek fellow that he waits at crosswalks while jogging the empty streets of Seattle. But his health regimen doesnt spare him from a rare form of cancer. From a doctor with an implausible lack of bedside manner Adam learns that his odds of survival are 50/50.Adams artist girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) who has an equally cartoonish lack of empathy refuses to accompany him to the hospital because its got ""bad energy"" while his hysterical mother (Anjelica Huston) is offended that he took so long to tell her the news. Just when it seems that ""50/50"" will be fatally unrealistic Rogen injects some sardonic humor as Adams friend Kyle. He advises Adam to ditch Rachael stock up on medicinal marijuana and use the cancer to prey on girls sympathies.But Adams most substantial relationships are with his fellow chemotherapy patients (including Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) and with Katherine (Anna Kendrick) a well-intentioned but inexperienced counselor who knows that shes offering canned assurances. Kendrick who earned an Oscar nomination playing a similar role in ""Up in the Air"" is just as good here. And while Adams last-hurrah high jinks with Kyle have an underlying sweetness his vulnerable interaction with the counselor as he prepares for critical surgery provides the emotional lift that the movie promises. ""50/50"" isnt a comprehensive movie about cancer as this short film tells us surprisingly little about the physical and financial effects. But as a prescription for depicting it this affable comedy is a healthy alternative to tearjerkers.50/50Three stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 139  Content Pervasive strong language sexual content and some drug use For Joseph Gordon-Levitt the glass is half full The actors been on a roll with meaty parts in the blockbuster ""Inception"" and the upcoming Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises.""

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Loosely inspired by the real-life cancer battle of screenwriter Will Reiser ""50/50"" is 50 percent affecting medical drama and 50 percent first-rate character study. Its also a comedy that sometimes makes you feel uneasy about laughing. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam a 27-year-old Seattle radio reporter stunned to learn that his back pain doesnt stem from jogging but malignant spinal cancer. His odds of survival are even money and the film details the turmoil that this half-death-sentence unleashes in Adams relationships. Adam a mild stable tidy sort has just slammed into the Mount Everest of messes. Best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) reacts to Adams news with candid alarm then declares that theyll beat the big C together as if you can tag-team osteosarcoma. Since Kyle is a blowhard with the emotional grace of a bull in a china shop hes not the ideal companion for what may be Adams final days. His idea of being supportive is urging Adam to shave his head and look more cancer-y so they can score some sympathy sex at the pickup bar. ""He still has his sense of humor"" Kyle barks. ""Its inspirational"" But Adam has to fight this battle with the recruits hes got and hes got Kyle. He also has an overprotective mother (Anjelica Huston) who finds ways to make her sons calamity all about herself announcing that shes moving in with Adam a smothering move that is as concerned as it is insensitive. Add to the mix Adams self-absorbed girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard perjury in every wide-eyed smile) and his novice therapist (Anna Kendrick painfully sincere and overwhelmed) and you have a formula for emotional havoc. Director Jonathan Levine has the ideal approach to the material which is to stand aside frame each scene honestly and let the actors drive the story. Gordon-Levitt is impressive as a regular Joe sideswiped by all the worlds cruelty and injustice. He gives us the sense of a man groping for something to keep him afloat while trying not to panic. Hes abject stoic antic wistful but always proud even as his capacities diminish never stooping to make poor-me claims on our sympathy. Rogens performance is not of the sort to entirely please his admirers and hooray for that. His man-child excesses are exasperating until theyre revealed as the only morale-boosting strategy that this boisterous lummox can imagine. The script follows the zigzag of messy life not the three-act pattern of screenplay manuals. Drawing from his own experience Reiser avoids artificial humor synthetic situations and tidy epiphanies. He stubbornly consistently plays every moment for matter-of-fact realism. Nothing feels preordained least of all the ever-shifting mood. Chris Helcermanas-Benge Summit Entertainment Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt left) teams up with Kyle (Seth Rogen) to battle the big C. The reason ""50/50"" works is its not trying to force us into any particular emotion. It fits in the emerging category of sad-man comedies such as ""Up in the Air"" and ""Crazy Stupid Love"" telling its downbeat tale with tenderness sincerity and warmth. ""50/50"" isnt a cancer buddy comedy or a male weepie but a message movie. The message is that you can tackle pretty much any subject matter and tell a story any way you want to onscreen as long as its absorbing.

"50/50 review Lack of honesty hinders cancer-inspired comedy |       NJ.com comments 50/50 review Lack of honesty hinders cancer-inspired comedy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 30 2011 at 745 AM updated September 30 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen play buddies in ""50/50"" First You Cry."" That was the title of a book by Betty Rollin some 35 years ago detailing her fight with cancer. And it became the template for a series of memoirs and movies about plucky people fighting an awful disease. But over the last few years writers have added a second line ""Then You Laugh."" The new approach -- as seen in everything from the film ""Funny People"" to cables ""The Big C"" -- is to both acknowledge the pain of a serious diagnosis and accept the awkward humor that springs from clueless relatives dopey doctors and a suddenly rebellious body. Seth Rogen who appeared in ""Funny People"" co-stars in the new ""50/50"" which was inspired by his friendship with writer Will Reiser. When Reiser was diagnosed with cancer Rogen suggested he do a script. Thats a comics classic philosophy -- its not pain its material -- but it hasnt led to the sort of consistently truthful work it should. The protagonist is just sort of snarky -- until he isnt. The chemo is reduced to one bout of nausea and some pot smoking. The truly outrageous idea that you can use being gravely ill to get sympathy hookups for yourself and your friends -- as underlined in the movies original better title ""Im With Cancer"" -- is given short shrift. Thats too bad because theres an even darker movie in here crying to get out and to get past all the typical Rogen hey-bro lowbrow antics (and past a vague misogyny in which women are problematic -- except the heroine who is shy and uncertain and comes off like shes about 12). It also has several good actors pushing it along. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a charmingly sly secretive presence on screen -- he always seems to be just about to tell us a wonderful joke -- and hes great as our afflicted hero who cant believe hes gotten sick (he doesnt smoke doesnt drink and is the sort of person who waits at Dont Walk signs even when theres no traffic). And its always a pleasure to see Anjelica Huston -- although you wish shed been given more to do as Gordon-Levitts worrywart mom. Anna Kendrick is very sweet as his therapist too (although she seems more like an idealized kid sister than a real woman) and the great Philip Baker Hall shines as a chemo patient with a taste for invective. There are also a few nicely subtle touches along the way (Gordon-Levitt ends up with a retired greyhound for a pet whose close-cropped nervous face mirrors his own). And the Northwest locations add some freshness as does an eclectic soundtrack. But it all never quite comes together as well as it should -- and for once it may be that this film had not too few rewrites but too many. The sort of things Reiser probably said after his first chemo session his ugliest moods or most embarrassing fears -- those arent really here. And its that kind of bracing honesty that patients depend on -- and that audiences appreciate. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations strong language and drug and alcohol abuse. 50/50 (R) Summit (99 min.) Directed by Jonathan Levine. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anna Kendrick. Now playing in New Jersey.

Seth Rogen manages to get laughs even in a film where his pal has cancer. Perhaps the funniest movie ever made about someone with cancer ""50/50 is basically a bromantic comedy centering on a 27-year-old living with a possible death sentence and how he gets through it with a lot of support and not a little weed from his BFF. Loosely inspired by screenwriter Will Reisers own brush with death at the hands of the Big C its a tricky balancing act. It succeeds mostly thanks to stellar work by the wonderful Joseph Gordon-Levitt who capably handles the dramatic heavy lifting and Seth Rogen who delivers big laughs as his raunchy bud. Gordon-Levitts Adam is a health-conscious NPR producer in Seattle whos stunned when he goes to a doctor for back pains and receives a diagnosis of a rare form of spinal cancer with a 50 percent survival rate. Adams party-hearty co-worker Kyle (Rogen) at first sees it an opportunity to share lots of the medical marijuana issued to his pal to cope with the side effects of chemotherapy. Later Kyle none-too-subtly suggests to Adam that cancer is a great ploy to score with chicks. The latter becomes necessary when Adams shallow artist-girlfriend finds herself unable to be supportive to put it mildly. (Shes played by Bryce Dallas Howard who has finally found a niche for her limited talents playing villains in this and ""The Help."") Reiser and director Jonathan Levine (who previously helmed the weed comedy ""The Wackness"") balance these high jinks with tougher-to-watch chemotherapy sessions where Adam meets with an elderly cancer patient (the great Philip Baker Hall) who imports some important life lessons. At first the old man is actually more help than Adams extremely inexperienced new psychotherapist (the delightful Anna Kendrick of ""Up in the Air""). She struggles to understand a patient whose preternatural calmness in the face of death doesnt match up with her training. And their professional relationship quickly threatens to develop into something far more intimate once she gives Adam her phone number. The therapist does gently push a reluctant Adam to seek support from his control-freak mother (Anjelica Huston) who is already dealing with an Alzheimers-stricken husband and has no clue how to respond to her sons diagnosis. As funny as it is Reisers script sometimes goes so overboard with the yuks that you crave more dramatic relief. The endless oral-sex jokes delivered by Rogens Kyle keep threatening to bring the homoerotic subtext usually present in romantic comedies out of the closet. At the same time the comparatively restrained Gordon-Levitt has enough powerful (and awards-caliber) moments as a young man forced to confront his mortality to ground the film in some kind of honest reality. Thankfully things never descend into the kind of hokey schmaltz that Judd Apatow ladled out in the thematically similar (and not terribly funny) ""Funny People which also cast Rogen as the wingman of someone facing possible death. I laughed a lot at ""50/50"" which has a dark sense of humor that appealed to me. If youre offended at Patrick Swayze jokes in this context you might not agree. Without giving away the ending I think its fair to tell you that I left the screening with a lump in my throat but no tears.

Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anna Kendrick Bryce Dallas Howard Anjelica Huston Marie Avgeropoulos Julia Benson Philip Baker Hall Director Jonathan Levine Running time 139 Release Opened Sep 30 2011  Editorial Review A silver lining in the cloud of cancerBy Ann HornadayFriday Sep 30 2011Book in the bathroom. Thats my new private shorthand for a scene in a movie that with economy subtlety and superb tonal inflection sums up what the entire movie is about. Its the scene that seals the deal sticks the landing and makes a good film great. Its the scene in ""50/50"" that nails it - narratively emotionally and aesthetically. If youve seen the recently released ""Restless"" starring Mia Wasikowska and Henry Hopper you may think youve seen enough cancer-in-the-Pacific-Northwest movies. But ""50/50"" takes the hackneyed convention of illness-driven melodrama and reinvigorates it with honesty clear-eyed compassion and unsentimental wit. Written by Will Reiser based on his own experience with cancer ""50/50"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam a mild-mannered NPR producer living in Seattle who is such a rule-follower that he even stops for the ""Dont Walk"" sign while hes jogging. ""I dont smoke I dont drink"" he says disbelievingly when he gets his diagnosis. ""I recycle."" As Adam arrives on that far shore where chemotherapy debilitating symptoms and looming mortality become his new reality he discovers whom in his life he can count on. Will it be his feisty but self-involved mother played with bracing ferocity by Anjelica Huston? Or his artist girlfriend? The fact that the latter is played by Bryce Dallas Howard recently seen as the witchy racist debutante in ""The Help"" might send up a red flag. ""Its an energy thing"" she lamely explains when she declines to accompany Adam to his chemo treatments. (Its difficult to tell at this point whether Dallas Howard is wince-inducing because of her self-regarding performances or the characters she seems to be stuck playing.) Then theres Adams best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) who makes Michael Stipe and Voldemort jokes when Adam preemptively shaves his head and seeks to buck up his pal by invoking Lance Armstrong ""He keeps getting it"" he says cheerfully. Such is the low-key irreverent wit that propels ""50/50"" (the title refers to Adams chances) which was in part inspired by Rogens own friendship with Reiser during the writers illness (hes now in remission). Unlike the twee aestheticized suffering of ""Restless"" ""50/50"" which was directed by Jonathan Levine doesnt seek to pretty up the grim realities of cancer under thrift-shop-chic leopard coats or comforting fantasies. Instead it offers a refreshingly frank glimpse of a world too often distorted by Hollywood for its own ends with Gordon-Levitts even-tempered Adam serving as the ideal guide through both its terrors and improbable gifts. (Perhaps the only allowance ""50/50"" makes to cosmetic license is letting Adam keep his eyebrows.) Chief among a fatal illnesss unexpected silver linings ""50/50"" suggests are the friends and loved ones who show up however inexpertly. Anna Kendrick brings the same stiff-necked primness to the role of a therapist assigned to advise Adam a woman so young she doesnt get his ""Doogie Howser"" reference and whose strained attempts at comforting him never manage to connect as intended. But the most clumsy by far is Kyle who battles his own panic by deciding to turn Adams disease into a babe magnet (""Its your hook"" he insists before the two plunge into the singles scene at a bar). The question of just who if anyone will truly show up for Adam turns out to be the fulcrum of ""50/50"" a movie that barely makes filmgoers notice that theyve come to care deeply not only about whether Adam makes it but for the friends he makes in chemo too. And its that question - made more urgent by a medical crisis but universal at its core - that the filmmakers answer so simply and movingly with that book in the bathroom. The moment encapsulates everything that makes ""50/50"" so good from Reisers unforced writing and Levines astute direction to the lead players appealing un-showy performances and Michael Giacchinos sensitive musical score. Considering that any one of those elements could have scuttled its fragile mix of drama comedy and life-and-death stakes ""50/50"" beats the odds with modest utterly winning ease.

Really strong story really strong acting. Nicksaid on Saturday October 15 2011 105538 AMCouldnt agree more. Here is my take on this beautiful film. http//nicksmoviereviews.com/5050-2011/ - Nick Brentsaid on Monday October 10 2011 84249 PMhey richard huge fan of yours do you think 50/50 will finally be the movie that gives gordon-levitt an oscar nod. i have been such a huge fan of his ever since i saw the lookout. if i remember correctly i think that you also enjoyed that movie as well when i watched your review on tv years ago. i feel like he is very underrated even though he was terrible in the gi joe movie but lets face it that movie is terrible and everyone makes mistakes. ive almost forgiven him for that hopefully 50/50 will renew my faith. nonyasaid on Sunday October 09 2011 113918 PMI believe Anna Kendrick is the most attractive woman in Hollywood right now by a good margin just comes across as sincere and is beautiful. I liked the movie surprisingly strong performances and excellent casting with what must have been good direction bring out a solid movie its sad its about cancer so if you go in thinking its a Seth Rogan comedy dont its funny in the honest stupid way that ppl handle cancer but once outside of that its definitely sad and brings out the emotions. my only complaints are that it was a little light and a little by the numbers in hindsight I wished it had been 15 minutes longer and a little more complicated the foundation for the later relationship seemed flawed and never felt like it was established why save that one was sick. that might be enough but a little time spent getting a little more insight into what one another saw in one another would have been better. give the movie a solid 8 out of 10 and an 8.5 genre rating.

He avoids the slickness and emotional manipulation of so many films about sickness. Terms of Endearment this is not.No doubt the authentic dialogue and believable comedy come from screenwriter Will Reisers own experience. When he was diagnosed with cancer in his 20s friends Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg encouraged him to write about it. Who knew it would later pay off so beautifully for movie audiences? The films overriding theme is simple Friendship and love are great healers. (Reiser has since recovered; Rogen co-stars in the film and co-produces along with Goldberg.)Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is an earnest public-radio producer with an attractive artist girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). His life is upended when he learns he has a rare potentially fatal malignant tumor on his spine. This information is dispensed by a doctor lacking any semblance of bedside manner. The news doesnt compute.""But Im going to be OK?"" Adam asks as only a previously healthy 27-year-old can.About the movie50/50    out of fourStars Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anna Kendrick Anjelica HustonDirector Jonathan LevineDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating R for language throughout sexual content and some drug use Running time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwideHis chances of survival are summed up in the films title.50/50 is as much about how friends and family respond to Adams diagnosis as it is about his own methods of coping. His worrywart mother (Anjelica Huston) offers to move in. His egocentric girlfriend gets him a dog but cant deal with the illnesss ""negative energy."" Only Adams knuckleheaded pal Kyle (Rogen) is there through his lowest moments -- the head shaving the gatherings with fellow cancer sufferers the precarious surgery.Also around to offer awkward solace during Adams bouts of anger and depression is Katherine (Anna Kendrick) a 24-year-old psychologist-in-training. Adam goes to see her but initially resists her well-meaning efforts. When she reaches out tentatively to offer a comforting pat he lightly mocks ""Its like being slapped by a sea otter."" Over time their guarded chemistry shines.Nuanced observations underlie the comedy. An emotional moment between Adam and his Alzheimers-stricken dad (Serge Houde) is lovingly conveyed. The film portrays vividly the everyday aspects of personal catastrophe as patients sit for hours filling their veins with chemo.Every performance in the film is flawless but three stand out Gordon-Levitt is terrific in the lead role a more emotionally raw version of his lovesick greeting-card writer in 2009s (500) Days of Summer. We root for his wry Adam because of Gordon-Levitts every-guy quality. Rogens delivery is flawless -- his banter with Gordon-Levitt is so natural it feels improvised. And Kendrick brings a sweetly endearing quality to her nervous therapist role.Easily one of the funniest films about serious illness it is also that rare buoyant comedy that can elicit heartfelt tears. Avoiding sappy sentimentality and snarky trivializing the story is sincere and deeply affecting. With its whip-smart script multilayered performances and pitch-perfect approach 50/50 winningly demonstrates that profound emotion and wide-ranging humor can co-exist in the same movie -- just as they do in real life.

Media San Francisco Chronicle 50/50 Comedy-Drama. Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anna Kendrick. Directed by Jonathan Levine. (R. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Right now comedy is where everything is happening in movies. Dramas are dramas and action movies are lost in 3-D hell but comedy filmmakers are trying new things expanding the form to include bigger chunks of life aspects of the human experience seemingly ineligible for comic treatment. And so we get ""50/50"" about a 27-year-old guy who gets cancer. Inevitably it follows the usual pattern of Illness Epics ""Hey whats this pain in my back? Oh its probably nothing ... "" But everything about the handling of the usual scenes is different made palatable not by glossing over things with jokes but by staying human scale and true to the characters. For the record I usually loathe illness movies even if theyre well made because who wants to spend two hours watching somebody get sick - unless theyre getting something like leprosy or scurvy which you probably dont have to worry about? But ""50/50"" will be liked and appreciated even by people who cant imagine wanting to see it. Some moments are hard to take such as the one of Joseph Gordon-Levitt waking up in the middle of the night following chemotherapy and throwing up in the bathroom. A few other scenes feel a trifle forced such as the camaraderie that develops between the young man and two much older guys during their chemotherapy sessions. But for the most part and to an impressive extent ""50/50"" finds ways to be honest about something awful and yet appealing and watchable.

Photo Chris Helcermanas-Benge Summit Entertainment 50/50 review Cancer comedy that rings true 1 / 2 Back to Gallery In one scene young Adam (Gordon-Levitt) eats some medical marijuana-laced cookies and then walks through the hospital where he is being treated. Its a chamber of horrors that would be terrifying to any sober person but because of the filmmakers strategy of making Adam stoned at this moment the sequence works in a complicated sophisticated way. We see what Adam is seeing but we also see how he is seeing it and his drugged capacity for distance at this moment becomes funny. Director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser do this throughout - they know what they have to show but figure out how to do so in imaginative and engaging ways. ""50/50"" is not about a fight for survival. The protagonist is more like a bystander to a fight being fought by his illness on one side and his body and the doctors on the other. He can do nothing but stand there and wait the one person with everything to lose. Often dark onscreen Gordon-Levitt has an open-faced probity that grabs the audiences interest and compassion. Its an interesting portrait in innate unfussy dignity. Related Stories 50/50 an imaginative and engaging comedy about cancer Review 50/50 50/50 Cancer movie both appealing and watchable Just as essential is Seth Rogen as Adams best friend. Rogen isnt even 30 yet but he is already an important actor - not just because hes popular but because he best embodies this particular comic moment. He can be brash vulgar absurd clueless ridiculous and laughable and in the next minute be warm unguarded sensitive humane and steadfast without either side of his nature registering as inconsistent or less true. Instead these contradictions are harmonized within the structure of Rogens screen personality which here and elsewhere - but especially here - hardly seems like his personality alone but emblematic of a generation. Anna Kendrick has a nice role as Adams psychologist a softening and an elaboration of Kendricks role as a young careerist in ""Up in the Air"" and Bryce Dallas Howard is Adams girlfriend who is not unlike the likable but superficial woman Howard took on in Clint Eastwoods ""Hereafter."" Howard is too good at such roles and too good for them. If she doesnt want to be playing such women for the rest of her career she needs to stop now. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

I admire the audacity of the script which was written by Will Reiser from personal experience and I laughed in most of the right places as people in Adams life struggle often absurdly to say or do the right thing. Yet my feelings about the film which was directed by Jonathan Levine hover around 60/40. I wish it well and wish it were better. ENLARGE Anna Kendrick Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen in 50/50. Summit Entertainment The best parts are the in-between ones neither laugh-out-loud funny nor overtly heart-wrenching a silent prologue in which Adam an NPR radio reporter in Seattle reveals his earnest somewhat passive nature by waiting for a dont-walk sign on an early-morning jog through empty streets; the stirrings of Kyles good and generous heart when it isnt outpaced by his potty mouth which he deploys as a defense against the pain he feels for his friend; the tinkly ridiculousness of the New Age pap that Katherine plays as background music for her patients relaxation exercises or her sweet confusion about the efficacy versus the propriety of touching Adams arm during their therapy sessions. Since ""50/50"" makes light--and dark--of nothing less than the prospect of death it can get you when youre least expecting to be got sometimes with nothing more than a glance at Adams face in gaunt repose. (Mr. Gordon-Levitt does impeccable work throughout.) And Kyles effusions which flow from his self-appointed role as Adams life coach and one-man support group can be just what the doctor didnt order to clear the stuffy air cut through the surrounding solemnity shore up Adams spirits and for whatever it may be worth in the end flip the bird to the Grim Reaper. Watch a clip from the film ""50/50"" about a man suddenly diagnosed with cancer starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen. Courtesy Summit Entertainment. Mr. Rogen is Hollywoods reigning maestro of burbling raunch. Much of his stuff is extremely funny--not just funny but surprising because Kyles mind is quick enough to keep us guessing about where its taking his tongue. But the more Mr. Rogen injects the story with needed energy the more he makes Kyles reflexive glibness seems like his own glib self-congratulatory shtick and the closer he comes to wearing out his welcome by dominating the movie. Secondary characters pale by comparison. You understand that Adams oncologist and anesthesiologist are deeply repressed--as the writers doctors may well have been in real life--but theyre written and played monotonously almost polemically to sell the point. Secondary scenes like one in which Adam first tries to use his cancer as a pick-up line are written sloppily in broad strokes that blur the reality of his plight. Where ""50/50"" comes delightfully alive is in its ever more romantic encounters between Adam who desperately needs a special someone to hold him together and Katherine who given her pack-rat predilections and her pitiful inexperience seems the least likely of Seattles therapists to do so. Take a step back and you see that Ms. Kendrick is playing the familiar cliche of a wacko shrink but this extraordinary comedienne never steps back for a moment. Shes into her character with such verve that she makes Katherine a shining example of transference for all concerned. Theres no way for Adam not to love her as we do. Take Shelter Michael Shannon a tall man with a searching gaze gives a towering performance as Curtis a plainspoken husband and loving father suddenly beset by schizophrenia. ""Take Shelter"" is only the second feature to be written and directed by Jeff Nichols but its a dazzling piece of filmmaking and much of the dazzle--as well as the anguished darkness--comes from Adam Stones cinematography which expresses the swirling state of Curtiss mind with richly varied flavors of light. (The original score all a-throb with scary incipience was composed by David Wingo.) ENLARGE Michael Shannon in Take Shelter. Sony Pictures Classics The title works on at least two levels. Curtis; his wife Samantha (another fine performance by Jessica Chastain whos been giving lots of them lately); and their hearing-impaired 6-year-old Hannah (Tova Stewart) live in rural Ohio where tornado shelters are part of the landscape. But tornados are a dominant part of Curtiss delusions. Hes so obsessed by imagined storms that he takes out a loan he cant afford to turn his little backyard shelter into a huge and expensive bunker that represents safety for him and his family and the depths of his subconscious for us. The images of his apocalyptic dream life and waking nightmares are mesmerizing and eventually all-embracing as the boundaries between reality and dementia blur in what amounts to a psychological thriller. Yet the images of small-town life are no less vivid and entirely free of comment or condescension a pleasant yard sale a Lions Club lunch a meadow bright beneath a cloudless sky. ""Take Shelter"" is full of sharply yet generously observed cameos Curtiss canny co-workers on his construction jobs; a local banker concerned with the loans risk; a free-clinic counselor who knows she cant give Curtis the psychiatric care he desperately needs. Watch a clip from the film Take Shelter. From the director of Shotgun Stories the film stars Michael Shannon. And the care Curtis knows he needs. The character as written by Mr. Nichols is insightful up to a point; his schizophrenic mother experienced her first psychotic break in her 30s and hes terrified that the same fate seems to be overtaking him at the same age. The character as played by Mr. Shannon transcends the thriller genre and the increasingly flat affect of Curtiss disease with a hurtling inevitability that culminates in two sequences of enormous power. (The penultimate and intentionally prosaic dramatic beat sets up a stunning climax.) ""Take Shelter"" which could have been called ""The Storms Before the Storm"" isnt the sort of film youd seek out for fun and relaxation. Its ultimately a bleak vision and a circumscribed one but remarkable all the same and proof that Mr. Nichols is ready for much bigger things. Weekend So much movie can be made with so little plot given sufficient humanity and dramatic tension. Thats the case with Andrew Haighs eloquent chamber piece which stars Tom Cullen and Chris New as Russell and Glen youngish Englishmen who come together in a gay bar for what promises to be a one-night stand and turns out to last a weekend. The first sign of something deeper comes from Glen who claiming to be an artist asks Russell to confide his hopes and expectations for the liaison to a little cassette recorder. ""Its for an art project"" Glen explains. Its also a way to suggest in what might otherwise be flat exposition why Russell has been stuck in a holding pattern of loneliness. Mr. Cullen makes him instantly likable and readily understandable not just as a gay man who hasnt quite come out but as a man who for all his intelligence and kindness hasnt figured out how to move on from the sterile safety that loneliness confers. Glen for his part professes tough-minded independence--friends he says can be like ""a noose around your neck""--though that facade breaks down bit by ironic bit. Much of the talk is about sex and much of the sex is candid; this is not a movie that looks the other way whether Russell and Glen are making love or making conversation that first conceals and eventually reveals their yearnings and deep fears. Yet ""Weekend"" in which a casual hookup becomes a transforming connection isnt only about gay life. Its about loves essence and the pain of its absence.  A correction In last weeks column I misstated the movie for which Wally Pfister won an Oscar for best cinematography. It was ""Inception"" not ""The Dark Knight."" DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Up in the Air (2009) Anna Kendrick is sensationally funny as Natalie the newly minted college grad and steely careerist who shows George Clooneys Ryan a thing or two about firing people with utmost efficiency. Compared to her hes the Albert Schweitzer of the piece. When he says with a fleeting suggestion of rue ""This is what we do we take people at their most fragile and set them adrift"" she understands in her flow-charting way. But her own vision which she articulates in a stiletto voice is to dehumanize the firing process even further via the miracle of video conferencing. Pi (1998) Darren Aronofskys first feature is another extraordinary visualization of mental illness. This one could have been called ""Digit Goes to Wall Street."" Its about a math genius Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) who goes mad searching for patterns in the stock market. (Right the movies pure fantasy.) But filthy lucre isnt Maxs goal. Hes really looking for the secret of the universe while the writer-director strives for and finds a daring dialectic between human emotion (mostly bleak) and deadpan Dada that recalls Godards ""Alphaville"" the German Expressionists and Terry Gilliams retro technology in ""Brazil."" Before Sunrise (1995) Boy and girl instead of boy and boy meet by chance on a train in Europe. They talk get off the train in Vienna fall in love and talk a lot more until dawn. Meandering and quietly enchanting this early feature by Richard Linklater stars Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy (and Vienna which looks a lot more inviting than it does in ""The Third Man""). The couple meets again nine years later in ""Before Sunset"" which has some lively moments but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love sex and married life.

Emotionally honest even when its going for big laughs and filled with lived-in visual detail its raunchy and touching without ever being crude or mawkish a small sharp comic jewel with a big heart.Cancer of course isnt particularly funny. That doesnt mean it cant be played for laughs Showtimes The Big C lets Laura Linney find humor in the precariousness of her new life; Judd Apatow tried to build in the comic potential by inflicting a standup comedian (Adam Sandler) in the overlong Funny People.With 50/50 Reiser and director Adam Levine take a smart approach by focusing on the walk-on-eggshells response shown by most friends and acquaintances of the patient a nimbly underplaying Joseph Gordon-Levitt.The word let alone the disease is enough to send the most articulate sympathizer into bumbling platitudes. ""Im not going to bail on you"" sputters Adams girlfriend Rachael (The Helps Bryce Dallas Howard quickly cornering the market on selfish female characters) before realizing some promises are hard to keep. ""Im gonna throw up"" mutters his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen Reisers real-life buddy and a producer of the film).Adam himself has the most natural reaction When his obtuse verbose doctor finally cuts through the medical terminology and utters the word ""cancer"" his field of vision blurs and all surrounding sound becomes a high-pitched drone.Rogens slobbish loyalty gets the guffaws; Howard earns the scorn. But the movies ace in the hole is Anna Kendrick as Adams young overmatched therapist Katherine. An Oscar nominee for Up in the Air and a game participant in the Twilight franchise Kendrick brings a world of nuance to Katherines nervous energy and fear of failure.She seeks to comfort her patient time and again by grabbing his forearm just a little too forcefully - one of the films many cleverly repeated gestures. But the green therapist and the stoic patient form a bond. Neither of them knows quite what theyre doing and under Levines direction their timing is winningly awkward.50/50 knows its way around pregnant pauses and sidelong glances the kind that good friends use to communicate without words. It works in some of the predictable punch lines -- Lance Armstrong Make-A-Wish medical marijuana (whats a Seth Rogen movie without a bong on the table?). But the humor is never cheap or easy not even when Kyle coaches his newly bald buddy on how to pick up sympathetic girls at bars. (Adams funniest failed attempt ""Great song. I have cancer."")When 50/50 wants you to feel something for Adam or for his confused comrades its already laid enough careful groundwork that it neednt push buttons or beg for an emotional response. It doesnt try to inspire which is precisely why it does.50/50A- Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Anna Kendrick Seth Rogen Bryce Dallas Howard Anjelica Huston and Philip Baker Hall.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + If youre feeling charitable ""50/50 may strike you as a brave attempt to broaden a Judd Apatow-style raunchfest to include death and disease along with the usual sex drugs and bromance. If youre not in the right mood you may feel it stuffs cancer into a small inappropriate box. The truth splits the difference Too pat and contrived to be the Oscar bell-ringer early reports have claimed ""50/50 is most affecting when it shows callow young dudes struggling to come to terms with the ultimate party crasher.So yes its about cancer and its a comedy - or rather the film paints a serious subject with a coat of nervous frat-boy guffaws. Based very loosely on screenwriter Will Reisers own battle with a rare sarcoma ""50/50 casts Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Adam Lerner a 27-year-old producer for Seattle Public Radio who goes into a doctors appointment with a sore back and comes out with a 50 percent chance of survival.When Adam gets the news director Jonathan Levine (""The Wackness) has the sound bottom out and the background go blurry a hackneyed cinematic trick that still works. Less clear is what were supposed to think about the doctor (Andrew Airlie) a cold fish who cant even make eye contact with his patient. Theres an entire arena of social commentary there that ""50/50 glances off without actually confronting. (In general the medical community remains in the far background of this movie.)Anyway why waste time when you can get down to the business at hand jokes about blow jobs and medicinal marijuana. Adam is a tightly wound worrywart (Gordon-Levitt one of our most likable young stars plays the part without glamour or ego) but his best friend is a gravel-voiced party animal named Kyle. Even if Seth Rogen didnt co-produce the film and wasnt a close pal of screenwriter Reiser hed have to be here since for better and for worse hes our national Id by now.Kyle blurts out all the things youre not supposed to say about cancer - its uses as a chick magnet for one thing - while being there for his bro in matters of hair shaving (a very funny scene) and transportation to and from chemotherapy. Adam doesnt drive a trait that hints at an infantilism that ""50/50 again doesnt explore. The movie tiptoes around its most terrifying idea that young men in todays culture can put off maturity for so long that its possible to die before you grow up.During chemo Adam befriends two other patients a crusty old pothead (Philip Baker Hall) and a gentle wise beanpole played by Matt Frewer. Theyre potential role models for the heros emotional journey but they too get pushed to the background by Rogens braying Kyle; whenever ""50/50 threatens to turn too serious it gets a shot of bad-lad coarseness.Thats probably why the womens roles are a mess. Adams girlfriend when the film opens is a high-strung painter (Bryce Dallas Howard) who crumples under the strain of caring for him and whom the movie quickly brands and dismisses as a cheating ho. Anjelica Huston has a few nice scenes as the heros fretful mother but Jessica Parker Kennedy is just a fill-in-the-blanks bimbo as a bar pickup turned on by the idea of sleeping with a terminal case. (Im making it sound more interesting than it plays.)Even more disastrous is the way the role of Dr. Katie McKay an awkward young hospital therapist who finds herself falling for her patient defeats Anna Kendrick (""Up in the Air) an intensely talented actress whom some of us have been watching with fascination since 2003s ""Camp. Kendrick gives a truly bad performance here - shes a self-conscious actress playing a self-conscious person and getting her signals all mixed up - and its unclear whether she has been hung out to dry by her director or if its just that the character makes no sense whatsoever. (But whats a cancer movie without a love interest?)""50/50 stays with the boys and thats its charm and its failing. Gordon-Levitt stepped in to take the lead role at the last minute after James McAvoy left the project but audiences have come to trust this star so much - hes the kind of smart centered performer wed like to think wed have as a friend - that we willingly follow him into the dark places ""50/50 goes.

In 50/50 Levitt waves you off and pulls you in as Adam a mild-mannered 27-year-old diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The title refers to his chances of survival. In Las Vegas those are good odds muses Kyle (Seth Rogen) Adams wild-mannered buddy. At the hospital not so much. Loosely based on the experiences of screenwriter Will Reiser and produced by Rogen (his writing buddy on Da Ali G Show) 50/50 mines absurdist humor from the veins of mortality. Levitt the definition of nuance is touching funny and fierce - an unusual combination of moods but deeply affecting. In the film directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) Adam is a draw-inside-the-lines kind of guy - the kind who when out jogging at 5 a.m. stops for traffic lights although theres no traffic at that hour. Adam is so busy comforting friends and family that he cant take the time to process it himself a source of the films most comically moving moments. He props up his mother (Angelica Huston heartbreakingly funny) he props up Kyle he tries to put the best possible face on his diagnosis to his girlfriend Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard). When the hospital assigns Adam a psychologist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) turns out that she is a trainee and he only her third patient. He props her up too. That is until she finds her professional footing. In a move that would be considered unprofessional she speaks to him as a friend rather than a therapist. And she gets through. Admittedly the film has its sitcom moments as when Kyle coaches Adam to use his diagnosis as a way of picking up girls. But Levitt drills deeper than sitcom shale and the result is beautifully modulated desperately funny terror. His performance creates the impression of one gracefully dancing through a minefield. In the films third act Adam faces a risky experimental procedure as he navigates his relationship (is it professional? is it personal?) with Katherine. Playing a novice professional who thinks she has the answers even though shes reading from a cheat sheet Kendrick is doing a variation on her character from Up in the Air. Yet her performance and timing are utterly original. In more than one way is the film 50/50 Its half hilarious half serious; all poignant.

I dont drink. I recycle."" Yet Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a producer for an NPR station in Seattle has contracted spinal cancer at the precocious age of 27. When he tells his pal Kyle (Seth Rogen) that his odds of survival are 50/50 Kyle tries to be cheerful. ""If you were a casino game youd have the best odds"" he says and proceeds to itemize celebrities who contracted and beat cancer -- ""Lance Armstrong gets it all the time."" At Kyles urging Adam uses his condition as a pickup line at bars. ""Howd you get it?"" a girl asks and he surmises ""Bad mattress."" A cancer comedy that doesnt quite live up to its killer premise and affecting backstory 50/50 follows Adam through his CT scan and chemotherapy treatment his oddly even-tempered reaction to the awful news (he jumps quickly to Stage 5 acceptance) and the flailing attempts of those around him to provide support. The film is Terms of Endearment with less hugging Dolphin Tale with a human patient Soul Surfer with a menacing spine instead of a missing arm Burt Reynolds disease-and-suicide farce The End with a more chipper outlook. And given Kyles mission to get girls for his disadvantaged friend its also The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Except that Adam is younger already has a girlfriend and could die by the end of the movie. Could as in wont. The origins of 50/50 are familiar to anyone who has seen Rogens guest spots on virtually every TV show this week. (I think I spotted him in the Tampa Bay dugout during Wednesday nights Yankees-Rays game.) Again and again he has told the true-life tale of Will Reiser who worked with Rogen on Da Ali G Show back in 2003. It was then that Reiser in his early 20s learned that he had spinal cancer. He wrote a movie script turning a comic light on his experiences and eight years after his half-death sentence has a complete-remission bill of health and the critics prognosis for a popular movie. (See a crowd-sourced profile on Joseph Gordon-Levitt.) To assuage audiences uneasiness about the topic under review Reiser and director Jonathan Levine who did the strenuously zany weed comedy The Wackness surround Adam with characters so conventional that you could plot their narrative arcs from their first scenes. Kyle is well Seth Rogen in every other film the hearty horny dope smoker who tries to take over someone elses life by turning it into an exact copy of his own but is au fond a mensch. To show solidarity with his cancerous buddy Rogen has to wear a frowny face once or twice but usually covers the concern with his famously deep persistent and hiccuppy laugh which makes him sound like a catarrhal Santa Claus. (He ought to see a doctor about that.) The movie has Adam befriended by two other cancer patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) who inject some furtive life into the gloom. But the women in this comedy of discomfort too snugly occupy generic roles. Adams mom Diane (Angelica Huston) is the overbearing Jewish mother whose first response on learning of her sons ailment is ""You waited a couple of days to tell me?"" followed instantly by ""Im moving in."" Diane (who answers nearly every phone call from her son with a barking ""Omigod whats wrong?"") is in desperate need of some redeeming features; most of 50/50s creators have Jewish mothers who will see the movie so you can bet shell get some. And since Adams lady love Rachel (Bryce Dallas Howard breaking Jessica Chastains recent headlock on roles for youngish redheads) is up to no good -- we know this because shes emotionally evasive and squeamish about hospitals -- that leaves an opening for his neophyte counselor Katie (Anna Kendrick) with her clumsily expressed good intentions and random empathetic insights to graduate to the Perfect Girlfriend category. (See TIMEs cover story ""The United States of Marijuana."") All these roles could have been found at a garage sale of comedy stereotypes. To the extent that 50/50 works its because of Gordon-Levitt one of my favorite actors. You could call him my Ryan Gosling. I praise his every performance -- as the Chandleresque teen hero of Brick the lovelorn yupster of (500) Days of Summer the fighter in Inceptions rotating hallway -- and hope hell enjoy a breakthrough to stardom. Its about time he has been onscreen since he was 7 played the teen alien boy on 3rd Rock from the Sun and invests all his roles with a sensible sweetness that subtly hints at a pain hes too courteous to express. He plays that underlying angst to perfection in 50/50 whether appraising himself with a shaved head during his chemo doses (""I look like Voldemort"") or taking consolation from a greyhound that Adam has been given as a pet and is now his bed partner. In Gordon-Levitts surgeon-adept hands Adams big tell-off moment -- when he orders someone off his front porch -- is accomplished in a whisper that makes the confrontation much more powerful than a Pacino-like shout would. His beautifully judged performance lends about 48 points to a movie whose Metacritic score deserves to be no higher than 50. See Richard Corlisss reviews (500) Days of Summer.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 29 2011 355 PM Title 50/50 With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen. A guy faces cancer with help from a friend. Director Jonathan Levine (140). R Language. At area theaters.First the tough stuff. For a mainstream Hollywood movie ""50/50"" pulls no punches in its depiction of living day-to-day with illness. Theres pain and fear no question.But this dramatic comedy is also warm honest and most especially funny -- traits its screenwriter Will Reiser surely valued as he battled and beat the same spinal cancer as his movies hero.Finally this nervy film avoids being blatantly ""life-affirming"" or ""feel-good"" helping it earn its tears and laughs. The premise covers the first of those. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen merge it with the second.Gordon-Levitt is Adam a 27-year-old Seattle radio producer who doesnt drive because he hates the risks and jogs in place while waiting for a red light. Such precautions make it that much more ironic when a recurring back pain is diagnosed as an aggressively malignant tumor.Adams instinct to stave off gloom is supported by his rambunctious pal Kyle (Rogen). Since high school theyve known each others rhythms like second nature. As Adams cancer proves inescapable Kyle becomes his most crucial piece of normalcy. When Adam splits from a girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) who cant deal with the illness the guys use his chemo-scalp to score sympathy points with women.Yet Kyles own relationship to his friend is genuine an unspoken assurance that Adams strongest connection to life wont be the threat of death.Though Rogen and Reiser worked on TV comedies together director Jonathan Levine generally steers clear of workplace and family fuss. And while Adams growing dependence on an inexperienced therapist (Anna Kendrick) is paced perfectly the cranky cancer vets he meets at chemo sessions teach him other survival skills.Motor- and filthy-mouthed goofballs with a core decency are Rogens stock in trade but maybe because hes playing a version of himself in Reisers story hes more appealing than ever. Kyle is going through Adams illness with him and his attempts to process it are touching.Meanwhile Gordon-Levitt handles the growing sense of dread. In ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""Inception"" he was upstaged by gimmicks. Here hes achingly real.At one point Adam walks wordlessly out of his first chemo treatment high on medical marijuana. He somberly watches patients go by and Gordon-Levitt slowly cracks up -- hes giddy from the pot and we dont hate him for it. Later he lets out a furious primal scream and we dont recoil. Remarkably he and Rogen make this moving high-wire act click.Magic Moment The night before surgery Adam walks the streets alone.

Its actually hilarious heartfelt and acted with such no-bull audacity that youll hate yourself for just thinking youd hate it. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> OK Ive got one more groaner hurdle. 50/50 is inspired by a true story ""inspired"" usually translating into an excuse to make shit up. Not here. Will Reiser who wrote the screenplay really was diagnosed with a malignant spinal tumor. Since he wrote the script you probably surmised he didnt die. And Seth Rogen who plays Reisers friend in the movie really is Reisers friend. Rogen and his Superbad partner Evan Goldberg helped get the movie produced. Im guessing the names have been changed to protect some of the raunchier jokes. Thats OK by me - 50/50 is better than OK its some kind of miracle considering the traps that could have mangled it. The stellar Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam (the Will character) a producer at NPR in Seattle and he gives one of the best performances of the year taking Adam on the roller coaster from diagnosis to dread and defiance without making a false move. And Rogen plays Kyle (the Seth character) with his signature bawdy wit laced with touching gravity. Gordon-Levitt and Rogen are a dream team even when the dream turns into a nightmare. Cheers to director Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) for giving the film a raw ragged look that deepens his attempts to keep it real. Gordon-Levitt shaved his own head in the scene where Adam decides to cut off his hair before chemo does the job. I cant speak to whether Gordon-Levitt participated in the scene in which Kyle trims Adams balls. But no rowdy opportunity is missed especially with Adam and two fellow patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer). More delicate feelings spring up between Adam and Katherine (a wonderful Anna Kendrick) his painfully inexperienced therapist. But for full-throttle emotion hold on for a superb Anjelica Huston as Adams take-charge mother coping with a son whod rather ignore her and a husband facing dementia. At every point when you expect the story to tumble over into sitcom/soap-opera excess 50/50 pulls back and sides with unvarnished truth. A movie handled with this kind of care is a rare gift. Refusing to hide from pain or bow to it 50/50 makes its own rules. Itll get to you.

A mild-mannered editor for Seattle Public Radio (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) learns that hes dying of a rare spinal tumor news that elicits less-than-noble responses from his sweetheart (Bryce Dallas Howard) and best pal (Seth Rogen). Skilled in both comedy ((500) Days of Summer) and harsh drama (Manic) Gordon-Levitt is one of the few 20-something actors who could pull off a role like this one and screenwriter Will Reiser drawing on his own battle with cancer wisely focuses less on the specter of death than on the awkward personal situations it creates. The fear anger and despair of terminal illness barely pierce the movies easygoing vibe which becomes something of a problem in the second half but for the most part this is fresh sincere and inquisitive.

"50/50 (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review 50/50 (R) Cancer comedy a cure for the predictable Joseph Gordon-Levitt left and Seth Rogen are shown in a scene from ""50/50."" PhotoAP Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com9/28/2011 Editor rating 3.5 As a rule movies in which a main character is diagnosed with cancer are dramas; nobody really wants to laugh too hard and long when Death sticks his ugly nose into the business of the living. Sure the classic weeper Terms of Endearment tried to lighten the mood by adding a devilish Jack Nicholson character who wasnt in the book but hes not what you remember about the film. What you remember is Debra Winger saying goodbye to her little boys and Shirley MacLaine screaming for morphine and how you had to sit in the theater until the end credits were over because you were embarrassed that your eyes were so red from weeping. Theres no guarantee the utterly unique 50/50 wont induce a tear or two but thats not the main aim of this fresh and bracing comedy. 50/50 is crude and funny and it demands that you laugh. And you will. Directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness All the Boys Love Mandy Lane) the film focuses on Adam a 27-year-old public radio employee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who is stunned to discover the sore back that has been plaguing him is a massive spinal tumor. A mild-mannered guy who doesnt drink or smoke Adam hasnt really been sick before - hes too young - and so he has no relationship with the doctor diagnosing him. Hes confused scared and completely at sea among the impersonal medical personnel telling him what he needs to do next. But hes also a guy so he tries to keep his fear buried. He resists telling his mother (Anjelica Huston) for reasons he cant truly explain; his artist girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) promises to be supportive but quickly is anything but; his hospital-provided therapist (Anna Kendrick) has good intentions but is deeply inexperienced. Younger even than Adam she doesnt even know how to pat his hand with encouragement (a running joke that never loses its humor). What Adam does have however is his shaggy best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) a good-time guy whos just as hapless as Adam at making sense of this reality but determined to keep up a good stream of chatter about it simply because he doesnt know what else to say. When Adam tells Kyle the odds of his survival are 50/50 Kyle refuses to look on the bleak side ""If you were a casino game youd have the best odds"" he points out. He decides Adams condition may even help them pick up girls and hes right. The sad irony is that Adam is truly too sick to do much about it when they do. The excellent Gordon-Levitt has swiftly become a major actor of his young generation; (500) Days of Summer showed off his hipster romantic comedy chops and Inception brought out the best of the action hero within. Playing the conflicted Adam requires more though as he must reflect all sorts of fleeting emotions and he passes this test so well youll wonder when his first Oscar nomination will come. The hilarious Rogen who also produces is basically playing himself here in the best possible way 50/50 was written by his pal Will Reiser who was diagnosed with cancer in his 20s. That explains why the film is ripe with the unglamorous little truths that make up a patients existence the dizzying platitudes offered by well-meaning but clumsy friends; the dull hours whiled away in chemotherapy; the physical exhaustion that always threatens to overwhelm; the inevitable descents into hopelessness despite most cheerful of attitudes. And yet the film - presumably like Reiser and Rogen did when faced with this situation - stubbornly refuses to lose its sense of humor. The scene in which Kyle confronts the cheating Rachaele in front of a clearly weakening Adam is an instant profane classic. Kyle may have no idea how to talk to his buddy about the possibility he might die but full of fury and righteousness he can damn well verbally beat down the faithless woman breaking Adams heart at the worst possible time. Scenes like that one indicate that 50/50s agenda isnt to shed light on the hardship of battling illness. Its about celebrating the bonds of friendship - however immature those friends might be - and how the power of laughter really may be the best medicine.

Surely she would have loved 50/50 a film about cancer that aims for that sweet spot. At age 27 screenwriter Will Reiser contracted a nasty multisyllabic form of cancer on his back and with this film he tells a personal story that looks a lot like a movie specifically Terms Of Endearment. (Though its much more profane.) Turning an agonizing experience into a viable Hollywood entertainment involves a little contortion and at times 50/50 seems too buffed-out and commercially minded to read as real. But it achieves the laughter-through-tears effect anyway thanks to the lightness and wit of Reisers script; strong committed performances; and some real insight into the difficulties of being supportive--or on the other end accepting that support. Ideally cast as Reisers stand-in Joseph Gordon-Levitt digs into a character role that also gives him a chance to show off the comedic chops he developed during his years on 3rd Rock From The Sun. After early scenes establish his character as neurotically health- and safety-conscious dramatic irony comes a-callin when Gordon-Levitt starts experiencing acute back pain and his doctor says he has a rare aggressive form of cancer. Before he can even process the news he begins chemotherapy treatment at the hospital and his friends and family struggle with the situation. His best friend (Seth Rogen) does his best to keep things light but his mother (Anjelica Huston) smothers him with concern and his girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) doesnt have the stomach for it. His young inexperienced hospital therapist (Anna Kendrick) has trouble reaching him too but they soon fall into a groove. The comedy in 50/50 goes a long way toward keeping the sentimentality at bay with Rogen playing a version of his real-life self showing how the affection between male friends can be smuggled into teasing and gallows humor. And though Kendrick gives the expected Anna Kendrick performance--terse high-strung fast-talking a little awkward--theres a touching interplay between her uncertain attempts to remain professional and her genuine feelings for her charge. Too bad the film doesnt extend the same generosity to Howard whos painted as two-timing and villainous rather than merely overwhelmed by a commitment she cant make. Yet 50/50 remains a funny thoughtful film less about surviving cancer than about the agonizing process of growing up.

"50/50 movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Grim reality provides fodder for tender comedy in 50/50 a 3 starsSeptember 29 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticJoseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen star in ""50/50.""Its a cancer film; no getting around it. But the tender and funny ""50/50"" addresses its protagonists health crisis and chances for survival directly with a refreshing lack of narrative hemming hawing or embroidery so that it becomes something more a picture with a commercial sensibility and a quippy streak yet one honest enough to transcend the usual.While writing for ""Da Ali G Show"" writer and producer Will Reiser not yet 25 contracted a rare form of cancer that manifested itself as a potentially lethal tumor creeping along his spinal column. His ""Ali G"" friends and cohorts included Seth Rogen and Ben Karlin a young veteran of the Onion.Years later Reiser turned his experience into a fictionalized but plainly personal first screenplay. After several more years of script development with Rogen Karlin and their fellow ""Ali G"" alum Evan Goldberg out came ""50/50"" directed by Jonathan Levine.Levines previous feature was ""The Wackness"" which was slick but borderline insufferable. He redeems himself here. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Adam a sweet somewhat forlorn Seattle resident who works for the local public radio affiliate. His artist lover (Bryce Dallas Howard) may not be the warmest or most honest woman on the planet but once Adams diagnosed and begins to wall himself off from his own panic-stricken situation shes sort of in there being sort of supportive. For a little while.Reisers script primarily concerns how Adam and his best friend and fellow public radio staffer played by Rogen receive the C-word news separately and together. Once hes free of his weaselly ex Adam is officially single and Rogens Kyle smells an opportunity. ""Help me help you get laid"" he says knowing that his own chances for romantic success might improve if he can get Adam on board. This side of ""50/50"" has the makings of a cheap broad black comedy. But what Reiser Levine and company have found instead -- a modest film of surprisingly deft mood swings -- lasts a little longer.While Howard cant make much of her role the story accommodates two other gratifying female portrayals both more nuanced than they appear at first. In her opening scene Anna Kendrick seems to be doing a virtual reprise of her naive by-the-book hotshot from ""Up in the Air."" Gradually though her role here that of a therapist assigned to help Adam through whatever comes allows her to calm down and connect honestly with Gordon-Levitt (who has a firm handle on Adams guarded gently fatalistic qualities). Anjelica Huston -- who as Adams formidable mother causes fusses and anxiety so she can swoop in and make things better or at least ""better"" -- makes the most of one womans push-pull responses to her sons condition. Dealing with an Alzheimers-addled husband this character has been in caretaker mode so long she can barely remember what came before it. ""I want you to know"" Huston says at one vulnerable point regarding her characters son ""I smother him because I love him."" The film might work without such moments. Some of its schematic and on the nose. But the grace notes are what make ""50/50"" better than simply ""good enough.""mjphillipstribune.com50/50 -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for language throughout sexual content and some drug use)Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Adam); Seth Rogen (Kyle); Anna Kendrick (Katherine); Bryce Dallas Howard (Rachael); Anjelica Huston (Diane); Serge Houde (Richard); Philip Baker Hall (Alan); Matt Frewer (Mitch)Credits Directed by Jonathan Levine; written by Will Reiser; produced by Evan Goldberg and Ben Karlin.

That is besides his malignant spinal tumor discovered only after the fit twentysomething finally sees a doctor about his persistent backache? Adams awful cheating manipulative girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) thats what She may be hot and artsy but shes really toxic. You know who else is eating away at our suffering heros guts? His smothering worrying mother (Anjelica Huston) who makes everything about her even her sons illness. Yeesh. And dont get me started on Adams oncologist (Andrew Airlie) an insensitive physician with cartoonishly terrible communication skills who should never ever be allowed to deliver a diagnosis to a patient. Both in their behavior and as movie stereotypes these guys are the worst Fortunately a couple of crucial allies help Adam in his fight against disease -- and 50/50 in its fight against bulls--. First among them is Kyle (Seth Rogen). The earthy bighearted trash-talking dude is not only the patients best friend but Rogen is also one of the movies producers with a big emotional stake in the picture The project was inspired by the real-life diagnosis and treatment of comedy writer Will Reiser an old friend of Rogen and his producing partner Evan Goldberg. Reiser himself wrote the 50/50 screenplay directed by Jonathan Levine (The Wackness). But its the Rogen-Goldberg touch with the duos characteristic Superbad mash of the sweet and the bracingly coarse that sells this unusual downer/upper of a life-and-death comedy. Kyle may be boorish in his insistence that getting laid is the right prescription for anything that ails a male A Kyle-style therapy session involves dragging his buddy to a bar and playing up Adams weakened appearance to the ladies as a sympathy-sex selling point. (The ploy works like a charm with Kyle also scoring as the guy whos such a good sensitive friend to the chemo-bald.) But the braying Kyle has got the right instincts for calling Adams girlfriend out on her cheating ways and for keeping his pal looking forward even when theres nothing to see ahead except uncertainty -- even when the patient declares ""I look like Voldemort."" Adams other angel and 50/50s MVP is Katherine (Anna Kendrick) a young therapist-in-training whose inexperience is offset by her tonic emotional transparency a vulnerability that breaks through her attempts at a grown-up demeanor. Kendrick rightfully scored an Oscar nomination in 2010 for playing another comically brisk young professional opposite George Clooney in Up in the Air. Here she adds a shimmer of endearing tenderness to her portrayal of a woman slightly terrified by the very situation she has trained for the counseling of the sick. Even administering the right physical touch of reassurance is a matter of trial and error and Kendrick brings an irresistible combination of understatement intelligence and comic precision to the act of laying a hand on Adams arm. The result is a duet of outstanding loveliness between Kendrick and Gordon-Levitt also an actor of nuanced control. 50/50 sends Adam into chemotherapy as a first course of treatment. (Reiser himself went directly to surgery.) Rather than waiting to lose his hair as a drug side effect he proactively shaves his head with energetic expressions of faux horror and real fascination from Kyle. But chemo also puts Adam in the company of other men hooked up to poison drips. One is old and crusty (Philip Baker Hall) the other is middle-aged and serene about his grim prognosis (Matt Frewer). The disconcerting sight of young Adam sitting on death row delivers part 1 of the one-two punch the filmmakers have in mind. Part 2 comes when Rogen and Kendrick fill 50/50 with healthy laughter.

Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anna Kendrick Rating R for language throughout sexual content and some drug use. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Seth Rogen Sounds like a laugh riot huh? In ""50/50"" it is. But its also moving. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is brilliant as Adam who goes from having back pain to finding himself fighting for his life -- the 50/50 of the title refers to his odds of beating the disease. Seth Rogen is also outstanding as his best friend. Its sort of like ""Superbad"" characters grew up and one of them got sick. And comparing a movie to ""Superbad"" (which Rogen co-wrote) is a compliment of the highest order. Interview Writer Will Reiser and Seth Rogen Director Jonathan Levine and screenwriter Will Reiser -- the latter is a cancer survivor -- could have taken the film so wrong in so many ways in so many different directions. They never do. Anything that might have come off as sappy doesnt. Anything that might sound false rings true. Just when you think a character will succumb to a disease-of-the-week TV-movie cliche something happens to prevent it -- in fact something happens to take the story in an unexpected route. ""50/50"" is a tremendous movie. Its also a really funny one which doesnt mean it wont make you cry. Ahem. So I hear. Cancer is not the only complication in Adams life just the overriding one. His girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) an artist wants to help him but is ill-equipped emotionally for the task. His mother (Anjelica Huston) wants to smother him with attention but the emotionally stunted Adam wont have it. Plus hes seeing Katherine (Anna Kendrick) a hospital-suggested therapist with almost no experience -- Adam is her third-ever patient. Shes fumbling her way toward her doctorate but beneath her insecurities and Adams fear its clear there is real feeling. Whats nice is how Levine doesnt overplay that hand but lets their relationship develop in the fits-and-starts way such a relationship would. Adam is a nice guy -- almost too nice at times -- but hes somewhat emotionally distant even in the best of times. Now hes confused and scared out of his mind and other developments dont help matters any. Of course hes got Kyle (Rogen) on his side which can be a blessing and a curse. A genuine friend Kyles not above using his friends illness to hit on women. He does have Adams best interests at heart but if it helps him out a little he figures whats the harm? Rogen is his usual funny self with inappropriate humor that turns out to be magnificently appropriate in the context of Adams fight. If you cant laugh. ... But hes not just funny. Kyle is as scared as Adam if not more so and Rogen lets that show. Huston turns what could have been a stock overbearing-mother role into something more over time as Kendrick does with her character. Katherine is off-putting at first but why wouldnt she be? Adam is facing the worst time in his life and she doesnt know the first thing about helping him not really. She knows the facts but doesnt have the feel. Yet she too grows throughout the film. Then there is Gordon-Levitt. He has been good in many movies ""(500) Days of Summer"" being a particular favorite. But hes in another realm here. His performance is pitch-perfect never less than compelling. Adams body may be failing him but the experience brings a growing maturity to his emotional life. He flat-out nails it. Which sounds again like the kind of thing fraught with the danger of cliches and short cuts. Levine avoids those at all turns making ""50/50"" an outstanding movie one of the best of the year.

"50/50 is a Cancer Comedy of Errors | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie 50/50 is a Cancer Comedy of Errors The Buddy-Flick Genre Continues to Metastasize By Rex Reed  09/28/11 1139am Gordon-Levitt and Rogen. In the pantheon of tastelessness designed to make you laugh at diarrhea menstruation masturbation yeast infections fellatio and worse you can now add a stupid horror called 50/50. Artificial irresponsible filthy and forgettable it knocks itself cross-eyed trying to make you roar with laughter at chemotherapy with the nauseating Seth Rogen milking most of the yuks. But a stoner comedy about cancer? I dont think so. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has two expressions -- sleepy and catatonic -- and he wears them ragged as Adam Lerner a 27-year-old reporter for National Public Radio stationed in Seattle who sinks into an understandable depression when malignant tumors are diagnosed on his spine and he is given only a 50/50 chance of survival. His best friend is a disgusting moron who is determined to cheer up by using his terminal illness to attract girls. Can Seth Rogen play anything else? I think they write disgusting moron parts for him in case Zach Galifianakis or Jack Black are busy playing other disgusting moron roles elsewhere and he plays them all the same way. Anyway in one of the few lines that can be repeated in print he says ""If you were a casino game youd have the best odds."" In this movie even the doctors are stupid. Adams oncologist is only 24. ""What are you? Doogie Howser?"" he asks incredulously. Doctor ""Who?"" Adam ""Doogie Howser. The teenage doctor."" Oncologist ""Does he work here?"" These are the jokes folks. Part of this movie is about the ghastly ordeal cancer patients go through--pain syringes vomiting and coughing up blood and a cold impersonal medical establishment that places little value on human life--and part of it is about everyone else--caregivers family members and friends--all of whom care more about themselves than the patient. (All false generalizations for the sake of laughs and like everything else in the movie grossly exaggerated.) When Adam undergoes his first chemo treatment his duplicitous girlfriend (badly overacted by Bryce Dallas Howard) waits four hours in the car because she cant stand the interiors of hospitals. His stressed-out mother (and what you may well ask is Anjelica Huston doing in this blunder?) acts like a cross between Lady Macbeth and Zasu Pitts. Eventually Adam gives up and falls for his psychiatrist (Anna Kendrick) in a sex game that is pure cardboard. Director Jonathan Levine who proved his incompetence with two previous disasters The Wackness and All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (a sex thriller so bad it was never released) based the film on the autobiographical experiences of the films writer Will Reiser. But nothing about it rings true. The gallows humor is unforgiving and the compassion is synthetic. The film reveals nothing new about advances in cancer research addresses no issues like the drug companies that suppress alternative treatments to profit from human suffering. No its just about one guy trying to get laid. As a nice fellow coming to grips with his own mortality Mr. Gordon-Levitt shows some tenderness that was never on view in grim movies like Brick and Inception but his character is so passive its hard to get a grip of your own on any kind of reality. Seth Rogen is too vulgar and creepy to believe as anyones friend but he is convincing as a dedicated believer in the medicinal value of pot smoking. My reaction to everything that happens in 50/50 was ""Why dont they just walk out?"" But nobody did so I did it for them. rreedobserver.com 50/50 Running Time 99 minutes Written by Will Reiser Directed by Jonathan Levine Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anna Kendrick 1/4 Comment Filed under Anna Kendrick Cancer Jonathan Levine Joseph Gordon-Levitt movie movie reviews Seth Rogen Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/09/5050-is-a-cancer-comedy-of-errors/,200,505032,5050,observer
"50/50 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 50-50 ) 50/50 (United States 2011) September 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Movies about characters suffering from cancer are nothing new. Tales of dying individuals have won Oscars built reputations and sold millions of boxes of tissues. Finding a unique niche in this crowded field is a challenge but director Jonathan Levine working from a script by Will Reiser has uncovered one. The key to his approach treat life with cancer not as a tragedy but as a comedy but do it with dignity and respect. Not an easy thing to be sure. Too much humor and we lose the characters. Too little humor and it becomes a Lifetime Movie. Balance is the key and for the most part Levine finds it. The title 50/50 refers to the survival chances of the lead character Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) once it is determined that he has a rare form of spinal cancer. The people in his life react differently to the news. His girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) pledges to stand by him then embarks upon an affair. His best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) tries to keep Adams spirits up by turning life into a non-stop party. His mother (Anjelica Huston) goes into smothering mode despite also caring for a husband with Alzheimers. While in chemotherapy he meets two new friends Alan (Philip Baker Hall) and Mitch (Matt Frewer) as well as a pretty therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) whose inexperience leads her to take a more than professional interest in Adam. Theres little doubt that the basic narrative of 50/50 is assembled largely from clichA(c)s a young man with cancer traverses the expected emotional spectrum his girlfriend dumps him he falls for his therapist he befriends a couple of codgers who give important life lessons etc. The thing that differentiates 50/50 is that it has a sense of humor. This isnt Terms of Endearment where manipulation and artifice clog every frame. Its funny and heartfelt. Levine knows when to tickle the funny bone and when to slow things down so we realize the gravity of the situation. Some viewers will doubtless cry during the movie but theyll laugh as well. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a yeomans job as Adam having stepped in for James McElroy at the last moment. Gordon-Levitts transformation from an average Seattle-based public radio editor into a thin cancer patient enduring the rigors of chemo is impressive. Rather than wearing a skullcap or using special effects to give him a chrome dome he opted to shave his head - an activity that occurs on-screen. (If an actor is going to go that far it needs to be filmed and used although second takes are obviously not possible.) Its a strong affecting performance - as good or better than 90% of the ""cancer patient"" portrayals previously committed to the screen. Seth Rogen meanwhile continues the comedians walk into more serious fare and its surprising how affable the often abrasive actor is in this role. He has some hilariously off-color ""Rogen-esque"" lines but there are also moments when he shows more depth than he has exhibited in the past. Anna Kendrick who has appeared in the Twilight movies but is better remembered for Up in the Air radiates sweetness and innocence - qualities critical to our being able accept the tired therapist/patient romantic connection. And in small roles Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer steal scenes. Levine comes to 50/50 with an unconventional resume that includes All the Boys Love Mandy Lane and The Wackness so its no surprise that theres a lot more here than just another production about a guy with cancer. There is a wealth of authenticity in the feel of the movie as if Levine and/or his writer have endured some of this stuff. A lot of the subtle things speak of someone with an insiders knowledge. The comedy is never disrespectful. Its often dark - sometimes to the point of being gallows humor - but it reminds us there are really only two ways to stand face-to-face with mortality with tears or with laughter. And sometimes the closer you get to the truth the more difficult it becomes to tell one from the other. If thats 50/50s ultimate message it is conveyed cleanly and clearly. 50/50 (United States 2011) Director Jonathan Levine Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anna Kendrick Bryce Dallas Howard Anjelica Huston Philip Baker Hall Matt Frewer Screenplay Will Reiser Cinematography Terry Stacey Music Michael Giacchino U.S. Distributor Summit Entertainment Run Time 139 U.S. Release Date 2011-09-30 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Profanity Sexual Content Drugs) Genre DRAMA/COMEDY Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 1.851 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre City Lights (1931) Apartment The (1969) Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (2008) worse movies of this genre Stepmom (1998) Delivery Man (2013) Magic Mike XXL (2015) Three...better movies of Joseph Gordon-Levitt Looper (2012) (500) Days of Summer (2009) Inception (2010) worse movies of Joseph Gordon-Levitt Stop-Loss (2008) G.I.

Adam the straightedge radio producer played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt has just finished his first round of chemotherapy. It was tough but the kindly gents IVd next to him (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) made it easier by sharing their brownies. As the Bee Gees play on the soundtrack Adam wanders through the oncology ward in a stoned haze and giggles at the sad-looking patients harried nurses and shrouded corpses as they float by.Its complicated making a movie like 50/50 which was written by Will Reiser based on his own early-twenties experience with a tumor on his spine. That scene and the whole film really intermingles anonymous tragedy with blunt comedy but uneasily--in a way that suggests that though its OK to laugh we shouldnt exactly feel good about it. (Indeed moments later Adam doesnt feel too good either barfing miserably as the chemos side effects kick in.)Although it veers maudlin in its final act--helped neither by Michael Giacchinos unusually sappy acoustic score nor by Levines metronomic choice to end every scene with its twangy strains--50/50 mostly succeeds as a movie about a young man fighting cancer that doesnt give in to sap or sentiment. While its often quite funny its more often angry; indeed the most welcome transformation Adam makes isnt from sick to well but from milquetoast to asshole.This is not how it usually goes in Hollywood films when illness so often turns heroes and heroines into shorn-bald saints. Cancer does make Adam a better man in a way Once a DONT WALK-obeying nail-biting welcome mat Adam dumps his duplicitous girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard even more villainous than in The Help) pushes away his overbearing mother (a touching and underused Anjelica Huston) and offers his therapist (Anna Kendrick fussy and endearing) some bracing sarcasm.The anger in 50/50 is often so intensely focused that we can only presume Reisers targeting individuals from his own experience a doctor perhaps who delivered a cancer diagnosis into a tape recorder as if he werent even there and then described his shattering condition as ""really quite fascinating."" The script is particularly sharp on the ways that cancer paints other people into behavioral corners as when Rachael faces the choice of swallowing her doubts about her relationship with Adam or being The Girl Who Ditched Her Brave Cancer Boyfriend.Im glad of course that Reiser survived his illness and glad as well that he transformed a truly awful personal experience into something interesting and worthwhile for public consumption. But I sure hope that the part about the horrible girlfriend is fictionalized--maybe a story point that one of 50/50s 12 named producers insisted upon?--because despite Howards best efforts to humanize the role its a pitiless portrayal of malignant cruelty. No one not even the cheatingest bitch in the bitchiverse deserves to be immortalized like this.On the other hand theres the movies only constant Adams good pal Kyle (Reisers actual good pal Seth Rogen). Kyle might only be able to relate to his buddys illness with nervous jokes but he sticks with him through head-shaving and surgery and despair. He reads cancer books on the john He is a Good Person And this is what makes 50/50 not only a cancer movie but also a Seth Rogen movie. Bros before hos before neurofibroma sarcoma schwannomas.

By David Denby Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill in a new movie directed by Bennett Miller.   Credit Illustration by MARTIN ANSIN Ted Williams was one of the greatest hitters ever to play baseball. But the game is excruciatingly difficult--Williams himself said that--and even he got a hit only thirty-four per cent of the time. What thrills the breed of scientifically minded baseball nuts known as sabermetricians is that Williams got on base an astounding forty-eight per cent of the time (he walked a lot) the highest on-base percentage in baseball history. A team wins by scoring runs so the sabermetrics boys insist that a player who gets on base a lot may be almost as valuable as someone who hits with power. (Williams of course did both.) In ""Moneyball"" Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) the real-life general manager of the impoverished Oakland Athletics has a successful season in 2001 but then loses three of his star players (Jason Giambi Johnny Damon Jason Isringhausen) to shekel-laden outfits like the Yankees and the Red Sox. So Beane hires as his assistant a pudgy diffident non-athlete named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) an economics major a few years out of Yale who happens to be a disciple of the sabermetrics guru Bill James. Brand digs into his computer to find high-school and college players whom Beane can afford--those with hidden sabermetric assets. One of the things that struck Michael Lewis who told Beanes story in his 2003 book (of the same title) was how thoroughly Beane and Brand (in real life Paul DePodesta who did not want to be in the film) ignored the teams scouts a group of barnacled heavily travelled savants who valued young players with the right ""tools"" or ""a great body"" (a term of athletic not sexual admiration). Beane goes after not just the lesser young prospects but also a bunch of butt-heavy seeming nonentities and washed-up sluggers who nevertheless get on base and generally embody the sabermetric virtues. Statistics and their alleged true meaning are at the heart of ""Moneyball"" but its also one of the most soulful of baseball movies--it confronts the anguish of a tough game. As Michael Lewis and the screenwriters Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and the director Bennett Miller tell it Beane is a confident revolutionary who is however in torment. In 1980 he initially benefitted from precisely the kind of scouts wisdom that in 2002 hes rejecting a player with all the approved tools he turned down a scholarship to Stanford and signed with the Mets right out of high school. But as a major-league player he got nowhere. Hes haunted by this failure and now that hes general manager his desire to win is so intense that he cant bear to watch the games. Instead he figure-eights around the parking lot in his pickup or burrows in his windowless office at the stadium or roams the empty stands at night a morose obsessed and unappeasable boss. The man who gives the movie its soul as well as at times its drive and exuberant energy is Brad Pitt which surprises me since I had written him off as a good-looking guy without much temperament. Pitt was fun in such films as ""Snatch"" in which playing an Irish bare-knuckle boxer he throws himself around the set and speaks in a brogue thicker than the head on a pint of Guinness and he was exciting as the unpredictable mock-fascist underground leader in ""Fight Club."" But when he stopped moving and the camera bore in on him (in ""Meet Joe Black"" for instance) his eyes were empty. He couldnt convey thinking which is not a sign of stupidity just a failure of technique. But recently something has been happening inside Pitt. In ""Babel"" he showed hints of fire and a fallible rage. And in Terrence Malicks ""Tree of Life"" in which he plays a father who takes out his disappointments on his sons his anger is self-wounding and tragic. Its a performance that deserves an Academy Award. In ""Moneyball"" Pitt has the air of a former athlete who never quite grew up. His round-cheeked face like Mickey Mantles has the congealed look of a picture on a baseball card. A restless man Pitts Beane abruptly overturns anyone who disagrees or cant keep up with him. Swapping players with other general managers on the telephone Pitt is almost as quick as Cary Grants manic newspaper editor in ""His Girl Friday."" Bennett Miller who previously directed ""Capote"" is perceptive about behavioral tics and shifts of power between people and lacking any other sympathetic material he concentrates on the developing alliance between the dominating Beane and the arrogantly intelligent but recessive Brand a conspiracy of two that shuts out everyone else on the team including the manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who never gets a clear explanation of the new strategy. Hoffman doesnt look anything like the real Howe but he has a classic aging managers body with a large rounded gut and like a lot of managers hes sphinxlike and impervious and surly. Miller takes us through the 2002 season running back and forth between actual footage of the As and staged stuff much of which looks better than staged games usually do in movies. ""Moneyball"" is a success story Billy Beane emerges from his misery and institutes methods of evaluating players that change baseball. The As win the American League West division title in 2002 and much of the movie is devoted to how Beane performs his magic as an executive. He knows just when to be cryptic peremptory encouraging and so on. Some of this is enjoyable but of minor interest (the movie could be used as a training manual at business school) and theres an inescapable oddity at the center of ""Moneyball"" Beane and Brand are possessed by a passion that is almost sacred in its strength yet its devoted not to character or courage but to hard cold numbers an irony that the moviemakers could have made more of. In the end Lewis Miller and the screenwriters may have gone too far in their gleeful celebration of Beane and their denigration of scouts. Beane has never made it to the World Series (in 2002 the As were eliminated in the playoffs by the Minnesota Twins). Oakland has had a mediocre record for the past five years and its finishing a lousy season this year. Success in baseball remains something of a mystery (though pots of money continue to help the Yankees and the Sox). Sabermetrics is a fascinating approach to winning but its one of many approaches not the ultimate answer. It cant explain why some teams with the right stats catch fire and others fade. In the movie the scouts say some dumb stuff but they know that statistics no matter how theyre broken down cant predict everything. They could respond to Beanes religion with an older religious text ""I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong . . . but time and chance happeneth to them all."" In ""50/50"" Joseph Gordon-Levitt crinkling his eyes and grimacing is Adam Lerner a radio producer for the local NPR station in Seattle who finds himself at the age of twenty-seven in the grotesque inexplicable situation of possibly dying from a massive tumor growing on his spine. ""50/50"" was written by Will Reiser a comedy writer who was working with Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg on ""Da Ali G. Show"" seven years ago when he fell ill; he eventually learned that he had cancer. Goldberg and Rogen co-produced the movie with the comedy whiz Ben Karlin and helped Reiser shape the script. This movie about catastrophic illness has its basis in TV comedy. Buoyant and observant ""50/50"" is a small winner; the director Jonathan Levine (""The Wackness"") has a great touch mordant but light-handed. The picture is as much about the way that Adams friends and family respond to his illness as it is about Adams trials. The others spend less time helping out than worrying about how they are coming off. Adams girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard) is scared and feels trapped. His mother (Anjelica Huston) her face a mask of rage drives him nuts with her self-dramatizing anxieties. His psychotherapist (Anna Kendrick) is smart but very young and she tries hard to get him to ""deal with"" something that cant be dealt with. She has another problem shes enormously attracted to him. And then there is his irrepressible and omnipresent friend Kyle (Rogen) who genuinely loves him but has a streak of crass opportunism. He picks up girls in bars and bookstores by displaying his sympathy for Adam. Kyle serves as a buffer for the audience registering dismay and fending off panic with crude jokes which makes it easier for us not to fall into a funk. Levine could have made the comedy darker and crazier but the even-tempered modulated style works well. Adam is trying to hold on to his sanity; the movie reflects his mild nature his sense of the absurd. Levine doesnt squeeze us though there are a few moments that are extremely moving. You really dont want this young man to die.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

(Photo Grove Hill Productions/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) Jeff Nicholss second feature Take Shelter is almost as barmy as its protagonist a man ravaged by apocalyptic visions and nightmares. But Nichols has a genius for making landscapes and everyday objects resonate like crazy for nailing the texture of dread. Michael Shannon who starred in Nicholss stunning debut Shotgun Stories plays Curtis a crew chief for an Ohio sand-mining company with a tireless wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) who sells homemade crafts at a flea market and a deaf little girl Hannah (Tova Stewart) whos in a lonely world of her own. In Curtiss dreams (sleeping and waking) storms bring rain with the viscosity of oil his dog rips him to pieces locusts blot out the sun and humans stagger through the night like movie zombies. Curtis knows it might all be in his head His mother (Kathy Baker) was diagnosed with schizophrenia at about the same age he is now. More and more he devotes his hours to prepping the storm shelter in his backyard forwhat? Hurricane? Flood? Plague? Whatever it is it will be like nothing the world has ever seen. The danger in casting Shannon instead of a milder soul is that he comes to each part with a personal haunted house and that his latest unraveling might seem like deja vu. But the actor his great overhanging brow creased with confusion is a truly anguished presence mythically inchoate. Nichols makes sure whats eating Curtis is eating you too. He breaks down scenes into images of destructionnot just obvious ones like funnel clouds and spiderwebs of lightning across the Ohio fields but chains and valves and shovels scoring the earth. Nichols and his cinematographer Adam Stone evoke the feeling of being inside a house staring out at a delugethe kind of will-it-never-stop rain that makes even home-sweet-home seem like an emergency shelter. See AlsoVulture Chat Room Michael Shannon on Take Shelter Take Shelter would seem as obvious as its title if the early scenes werent so lovingly detailed. Stewarts Hannah has a quiet but beseeching presence and Shannons attempts at sign language make him seem like the gentlest of giants. And Chastain turns an entirely reactive part into a major presence. Is she the most vivid actress to hit the screen in yearsmaybe decades? On the basis of this film and Jolene and The Debt and even The Tree of Life Ill say she just might be. Partly its her otherworldly beauty which writer Tom Shone describes as of that fascinatingly multi-planed sortalternately luscious and drawnthat makes you hungry for as many angles as possible. But its also how she moves how her dancers body physicalizes emotion in this case her love for her daughter (through her fervent signing) and the fear of her husbands escalating mania. She can tense a muscle and charge the space. Nichols has a good eye for actorsI wanted even more of Shea Whigham as Curtiss hangdog co-worker and Ray McKinnon as his mysteriously insinuating older brother. And his feelers for the countrys bad vibes are supernaturally keen. Shotgun Stories centered on a feud between two sets of half-brothers and it captured the connection between fatherlessness and the impulse to wreak vengeance like no American film Ive seen. The obvious comparison to Take Shelter is Todd Hayness Safe in which a woman (Julianne Moore) is slowly dying from modern life. The male version comes a decade and a half later at a time when the Book of Revelation has entered mainstream politics when each year brings a new prediction of the exact date the world will end when hurricanes and floods and earthquakes and heat waves and melting ice caps and industrial accidents and no jobs and Michele Bachmanns crazy eyes are fixtures of our conscious and possibly unconscious lives. The end of Take Shelter is well talk after you see it. But it doesnt come from nowhere. This is a terrific monster-movie manquea pure distillation of portent. The title 50/50 denotes the chance Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has of surviving (and for that matter not surviving) a rare spinal cancerodds that his loud pal Kyle (Seth Rogen) points out would be the best ever if he were a casino game. Thats the kind of line that puts the movie over. As a joke its more shrill than funny. As an expression of Kyles divided impulsesto cry out in horror and to say something upbeatits funny and touching. Unlike most disease-of-the-week movies 50/50 is itself split Its focus lies half on the young man blindsided by the prospect of a swift and early death half on the people who behave like idiots in the face of his illness. Cancer becomes a springboard for tragicomedy instead of bathos. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Not to suggest that this is a grim film but theres a vital difference between say the trumped-up day-seizing of The Bucket List and this a funny moving well-grounded take on a potentially traumatic experience. Adam (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) doesnt understand how he has managed to get cancer in his mid-twenties. He doesnt drink smoke drive or even jaywalk. The worst thing he does is bite his nails and yet here he is forced to face his mortality at a fairly young age. Everyone says that theyll be there for him - best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen) girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) therapist Katie (Anna Kendrick) - but Adam swears that hes fine over and over again though maybe more for himself than the sake of others. Seldom do we actually see him breaking the news to friends and family save for Mom who promptly freaks out; director Levine (The Wackness) prefers to cut to the reactions and scales back the potential repetition of having Adam sit each significant other down one by one. Much of 50/50s appeal comes from how well it works as a comedy of manners as everyone tries to say the exact right thing in the exact right way while Adam responds from the intersection of denial and defensiveness. Gordon-Levitts performance is frequently sarcastic but generally understated so that when his frustrations and fears finally do boil over in some of the films final scenes the emotional blows land with a force both unexpected and well-earned. Less surprising is Rogens role as the boisterous buddy prone to getting high and doling out pop culture references ad nauseum. Rogen a co-producer on this really was best friends with screenwriter Will Reiser as he coped with cancer but it takes him a while to shed the usual schtick and find his footing as the boorish but loveable pal. Weve similarly seen Kendrick play highly-strung individuals before in Rocket Science and Up in the Air but she doesnt often start from a place of warmth and her delicate determined application of sincere concern complements Gordon-Levitts quiet stubbornness nicely (a stubbornness also served well by both Michael Giacchinos melancholy guitar-and-piano compositions and Vancouver locations suitably subbing for the aptly overcast Seattle). When it becomes apparent that Rachael might not be fully up to caring for her boyfriend Howard walks a fine line just as she had in The Help of taking an easily detestable character and suggesting enough doubt and hesitancy in abandoning a relationship thats come to ask more of her than expected that she doesnt feel like a full-on villain. Are we surprised that one love interest enters the picture as another departs? No. Are we surprised that the two other patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) who befriend Adam during chemotherapy sessions are red shirts in waiting? Not really but they add some priceless levity to the film with their drug-laced confections. Even having Adams father suffering from Alzheimers a potential for eye-rolling if ever there was one is a choice handled with care. For all of the familiar plot points and potential pitfalls Levine and Reiser walk a tonal tightrope throughout with no one in the ensemble ever really hitting a false note. 50/50 is that rare beast a respectable tearjerker that also happens to be a winning comedy of manners; while Katie finds it hard to touch Adam in just the right way this film shouldnt have the same problem with touching its audience.

A guy in his late 20s faces even odds of beating cancer in ""50/50"" a title that could also describe the ratio of too-obvious humor to genuinely affecting drama in this uneven seriocomedy. Will Reisers semiautobiographical script initially prescribes too artificial a story treatment for its characters but is rescued by a genial low-key vibe that builds in sensitivity and emotion up through the final reels. Handicapped by a depressing if widely relatable cancer-sucks premise Summits campaign is placing misleading emphasis on Seth Rogens rambunctious best-friend turn to sell laff-seeking audiences on this likable but hardly uproarious Sept. 30 release. The kind of responsible risk-averse guy who regularly goes running around his native Seattle and wont cross a street until the traffic light permits 27-year-old NPR staffer Adam Lerner (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is understandably surprised when he learns of the malignant tumors along his spine. In an overly cold anesthetized scene intended to emphasize Adams shellshock and the impersonal nature of the medical establishment an oncologist tells him he has a 50/50 chance of survival. Adam tries to remain optimistic no easy feat after his mother Diane (Anjelica Huston) and his best bud Kyle (Rogen) react to the news in ways more overbearing than helpful. Of course the one who fails Adam is the one he needs the most Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) his sexy artist girlfriend promises to stand by him and nurse him back to health but her discomfort with the ickier aspects of Adams chemo regimen -- tastefully depicted here with some heard-but-not-seen vomiting -- is an immediate giveaway that her commitment is rather less than what it appears to be. Around the same time Adam begins counseling sessions with newbie therapist Katherine (Anna Kendrick) that are by turns awkward tetchy and mildly flirtatious. While Reisers screenplay has its roots in personal experience these setup passages ring false in ways that suggest a movie torn between its crowd-pleasing imperatives and its obligation to say something insightful about Adams experience as well as Reisers. Theres something admirable about the pics willingness to suggest that our nearest and dearest do sometimes abandon us in our hour of greatest need and the searing confrontation scene that seals Rachaels betrayal is impressively bold and nervy. Yet this subplot as a whole from its convenient demonization of the unfaithful g.f. to its post-breakup celebratory montage leaves an altogether sour aftertaste. Similarly problematic is the pat idealized development of Adam and Katherines relationship as they begin to blur the doctor-patient boundaries. If these emotional developments feel too cardboard there are compensations in Jonathan Levines direction whose overall mellowness feels at one with Adams nice-guy passivity. The essential appeal of ""50/50"" is that the cancer patient here is someone who is decidedly not the life of the party and Gordon-Levitt is ideally cast as the sort of sensitive self-effacing guy who seems more special and appealing the longer you spend with him. Actor and script adroitly convey conflicting emotions that patients with long-term illnesses and their loved ones will surely recognize Adams frustration at having to comfort those closest to him rather than be comforted and his refusal of the easy pity offered by friends and acquaintances in between snatches of small talk. Its this level of quiet perceptiveness that enables ""50/50"" to finally ahem get into your system. Supporting thesps are effective even when the pic uses them in questionable ways. Howard who between this and ""The Help"" is perhaps in danger of being typecast as a villain nonetheless makes Rachael as human and sympathetic as possible under the circumstances. Rogen allowed to set perhaps too broad and vulgar a tone at first eventually dials it down as the pic takes its exploration of Adam and Kyles friendship to a deeper level. Best of all is Huston whose casting in what initially seems to be a slight nagging-mom role pays off down the road with enormous emotion. Final scene is of a piece with the films loose easy mood yet quietly surprising in the note it chooses to end on. Pic overall marks a flawed but reasonably confident progression for Levine after his 2008 Sundance hit ""The Wackness"" with which it shares an exuberant belief in the therapeutic benefits of pot smoking no matter what ails you. Tech package is no-nonsense but pro with Vancouver and other British Columbia locations standing in effectively for gray chilly Seattle. 50/50ProductionA Summit Entertainment release presented in association with Mandate Pictures of a Point Grey production.

TWITTER This cancer comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick was written by Will Reiser who draws on his personal battle with a rare form of that disease. One no longer gasps at the audacity of a movie trying to get laughs about cancer or life-threatening illnesses. Such movies have become a virtual subgenre among European filmmakers and Showtime has found ratings and awards season success with The Big C its dark comedy about a woman diagnosed with cancer.There can of course be missteps as recent as Gun Van Sants treacly tale Restless in Cannes or for those with strong memories or even stronger DVD collections as far back as 1978s The End starring and directed by Burt Reynolds. (The terminal illness in the latter case was never mentioned if memory serves.) Into this subgenre boldly steps 50/50 a cancer comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anna Kendrick and written by Will Reiser who draws on his personal battle with a rare form of that disease. His success rate in the delicate balance between comedy and the profound devastation of such an illness is much greater than 50/50 but the film is not without its tonal lapses. The guess here is that when the Jonathan Levine-directed film opens domestically Sept. 30 following its Toronto debut mainstream audiences are now sufficiently conditioned for a comedy about a disturbing illness -- just so long as that movie sticks to the sunny side of the street. Which 50/50 does with great care. Even during the movies opening credits Michael Giacchinos chirpy music assures the audience that everything is going to be just fine. Then the films handful of characters get introduced as you would in any situation comedy -- the easy banter the instant recognition of types and the readily identified girlfriend-problem its hero-victim already suffers. The question 50/50 raises is just how far into sitcom territory can you venture with such material without trivializing the terrifying cancer experience? Reiser has it all over any other filmmaker who can only guess at what that experience is like. And maybe things did happen this way to Reiser who as a comedy professional took the Norman Cousins approach of laughing illness into submission. But this comedy professional has processed his experience through a purely formulaic screenplay. Not a bad one mind you and certainly not one without a goodly number of laughs. But you see nearly every story development coming a mile away. As soon as Gordon-Levitts Adam get his diagnosis the story breaks off into sitcom zones Adams home where irrepressible best bud Kyle (Seth Rogen doing double duty as a producer) drops by at all hours to bring happy-slob good cheer and also where distressed girlfriend Rachael (Bryce Dallas Howard) is game to take care of her man for all of about five minutes; the clinic where Adam does his chemo with a pair of personable level-headed older patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer); and the intimate therapists office where a flirtation develops between Adam and his highly inexperienced illness counselor Katherine (Kendrick). Reiser has written his characters with an indelible sweetness and vulnerability which allows the cast to deliver performances with some depth. So a situation such as Kyle insisting that Adam and he should cruise girls at a bar looking for sympathy lays -- Cruisin with the Big C as it were -- comes off as quite funny as does Adams first chemo session where he ingests weed-laced sweets created by a fellow patients wife and floats out of the hospital afterwards. Gordon-Levitt is such a fine actor that with what amounts to a completely reactive character he still scores big with easy-to-identify-with emotions that pitch him increasingly into a panic mode as the illness wont loosen its grip. Its worrying that Kendricks role here is so close to her Oscar-nominated performance in Up in the Air as a novice professional who wrongly thinks she has all the right answers. But such is her facility with emotional transitions that she makes a success of a role that may have been written with perhaps a little too much condescension. Even worse in that department however is Howards girlfriend who wears her insincerity on her sleeve. Following The Help Howard is in danger of turning into Hollywoods favorite beautiful villain. Rogen stretches no new acting muscles here but he does as intended provide a humorous counterbalance to the horrific (though mostly off camera) rigors of Adams cancer treatment. Anjelica Huston starts off as a typical overbearing worried mother but gradually establishes her own beachhead in the storys emotions as she copes with to paraphrase Adams therapist a husband she cant talk to and a son who wont return her calls. Strangely the movie achieves its greatest success in its third act the place where most movies collapse. Perhaps because the seriousness of Adams condition is more apparent by then its able to better convey the dark comedy promised earlier. The emotional balance is more stable and everything feels more real and less ... well sitcom-ish. Tech credits are fine with Terry Staceys cinematography doing justice to Canadian locations masquerading as Seattle and Annie Spitzs production design locating the scary battle for survival in an authentic but nonetheless visually pleasing environment.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Sep. 07 2011 105PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Directed by Jonathan Levine (USA) Even hardened cynics will embrace the cliche - yep you will laugh you will cry. When doctors discover a malignant tumour in his back Adam gets his survival odds and the movie gets its title. The rest spins his potentially terminal cancer into a buoyant romcom an unlikely partnership that dancing adroitly between the drama and the laughs works remarkably well. Seth Rogen is there to dole out his trademark yuks Anna Kendrick doubles as a callow counsellor plus the budding love interest and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is touchingly restrained in the victims role. Youd expect black comedy here not these brighter hues but with a few exceptions - the bad-girlfriend subplot an antic car crash - the colour scheme is a credible blend of lively and sombre. Expect this to be a huge crowd-pleaser - Id put the odds at 90/10.
