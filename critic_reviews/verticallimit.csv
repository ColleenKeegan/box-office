""Vertical Limit"" starring (from top) Chris ODonnell Robin Tunney Scott Glenn Bill Paxton. Hanging by a Thread / Fake emotion of ""Vertical Limit"" sucks interest from titillating action 1 / 3 Back to Gallery VERTICAL LIMIT Action Drama. Starring Chris ODonnell Robin Tunney Bill Paxton and Scott Glenn. Directed by Martin Campbell. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The mountain-rescue movie ""Vertical Limit"" doesnt just operate at the height of ludicrousness; it also puts marshmallow Chris ODonnell in the business of saving lives. And with the help of more than one special effect and lots of Patagonia-clad stand-ins he does it like a pro. But in a movie with this many snowdrifts ice prisons and stunt doubles ODonnell is really beside the point. ""Vertical Limit"" would have us believe its ne plus ultra of the popular ultimate-sport home video genre. The story presumes to be about a photographer (ODonnell) who puts a team together to save his rock-climbing superstar sister (Robin Tunney) from otherwise certain death in a cave on K2. Were one to marry the moves in those extreme-sport home videos to a race-against-time narrative and ask ODonnell and an ""international"" cast to strap on canisters of nitroglycerin amid avalanches and unstable ice the result would be something resembling ""Vertical Limit."" The film is well shot and has titillating action without a single persuasive emotion. Mathematically that equals pornography and cinematically -- well the cameras expertly record the breaking ice the bodies lugeing down a mountainside at top speed and an entire family left dangling on a single climbing rope. Said family is introduced like something out of a circus sponsored by Prana athletic gear -- the Grappling Garretts. The film opens as father daughter and son (Stuart Wilson Tunney ODonnell) embark on a regular Utah summer rock climb that goes God- awful when two novice climbers plunge onto the Garretts line. Its an insanely charged bit of action that results in Pop demanding that his son Peter cut the line sending him to his death so that his two kids can live with the ensuing trauma. ODonnell even sports a priceless look of faux horror that goes nicely with the soundstage environs. Its a look that leads viewers to believe that the tighter the camera holds on his face the sooner a prankster like old-school Brian De Palma will yell ""cut."" No dice This movie is really happening. And to think that just before all that quasi-Freudian cord-cutting the whole family was singing ""Take It to the Limit"" as some kind of foreshadowing. But to the limit of what exactly? The Eagles never said but director Martin Campbell suggests the limit of melodramatic reason. In the years since the Accident Peter and Annie have been estranged -- shes of the mind that Peter was hasty in his cutting. Their reunion at a camp in the Himalayas is so awkward that viewers might wish that those pages of the script had spiraled to the ground with Dad. Instead ODonnell and Tunney (whom we prefer as the Goth girl of ""The Craft"" not a snow bunny) convey the trauma that dare not speak its name with averted glances and weird thick silences. Annie has become a world-class climber getting mixed up with a crazy billionaire Texas tycoon named Elliot Vaughn who wants to make it to the top of K2 the worlds second-highest mountain to promote his airline. This guy is supposed to evoke the casual megalomania of Virgin honcho Richard Branson. But as played by Bill Paxton he answers the question of what happens when you mix a Bush a Kennedy and Gore-Tex. Vaughn has roped Annie into the expedition and into an enormous storm the perfect one in fact. But he refuses to turn back. Yadda yadda yadda They end up trapped in the ice cave and Peter has 36 hours to get near the top of K2 before Annie succumbs to pulmonary edema. sk2 It would take a team of international mountain specialists and a Renny Harlin-load of jaw-dropping action sequences to make this worth sitting through. And in spite of itself the movie delivers one ridiculous stunt after the next. Our specialists include Scott Glenn as a yeti with a logic-defying score to settle with Vaughn and the sequences feature the nitro Peter insists on dragging up K2 to try to blast out Annie and company. sk0 Every thrill sequence is like a little song the refrain of which is always a bunch of people hanging onto a rope for dear life as though wed find the repetition as traumatic as Peter and Annie would. To speak in the parlance of the studio pitch meeting yes like ""Cliffhanger"" and ""K2"" ""Vertical Limit"" is ""Die Hard"" on a mountain; its ""The Wages of Fear"" in a yurt; its pages from Jon Krakauers Mount Everest nightmare ""Into Thin Air"" folded into a paper ski hat. Most of the human action meanwhile is carried on in such a clunky anti-verbal fashion that the occasional silent-movie intertitle would suffice -- with ""Strap on the nitro"" being the only one that matters.

(Columbia Tri-Star) Oh sure the characters arent as three-dimensional as you might have wanted. In fact theyre not even one-dimensional. But in ""Vertical Limit"" possibly the most suspense-charged mountain-climbing movie ever made thats the least of your concerns. Forget what issues these characters nurse in their souls. (In fact we do learn their various issues and trust me its a good thing they spend more time climbing rocks.) What matters is the nail-biting possibility that they might just be plummeting to their hideous deaths from the rugged face of K2 the second-highest peak in the world. There are other dangers too like the TNT explosives a rescue team has to carry in order to blow three trapped climbers out of an icy tomb. ""Vertical Limit"" starring Chris ODonnell Bill Paxton and Scott Glenn is an adrenaline-pumped combination of ""Wages of Fear"" (Henri Georges-Clouzots 1952 cult classic about a truck bearing a dangerous nitroglycerine load) and ""Cliffhanger."" Directed by Martin Campbell (who made ""GoldenEye"" and ""The Mark of Zorro"") its a roller-coaster experience full of perilous drops devastating avalanches and volatile bomb explosions. This isnt about people. Its about not dying. Dont come late by the way. The movie starts with a horrifying prelude. Peter Garrett (ODonnell) his sister Annie (Robin Tunney) and their father are scaling a butte in Monument Valley when an unforeseen catastrophe involving other mountaineers leaves five climbers dangling over the abyss. Peter is forced to make a terrible decision the results of which hang over the rest of the movie. A few years later Peters a National Geographic photographer. But Annies still climbing. They bump into each other at a K2 base camp in the Himalayas. Hes shooting snow leopards. Shes part of a big public relations stunt climbing with wealthy entrepreneur Elliot Vaughn (Paxton) who wants to get to the top of K2 just in time to greet one of his brand-new commercial airplanes. Prepare to hiss at this guy throughout the movie. He gets worse and worse. Accompanying Vaughn and Annie is master climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) and some Pakistani helpers. Ignoring dire weather predictions Vaughn presses the summit team to go all the way. The storm comes. An avalanche follows. The Pakistanis are lost. The Americans plunge into a crevasse and find themselves trapped. Back at the base camp Peter rounds up a rescue team full of oddballs Theres craggy mystical grumpy Montgomery Wick (Glenn) who could outglare the sun; Monique (Izabella Scorupco) a French-Canadian climber whos more sullen than 10000 teenagers grounded for a lifetime; two Aussies (Ben Mendelsohn and Steve Le Marquand) who never found anything they couldnt smoke or drink; and Kareem (Alexander Siddig) a Pakistani porter whose cousin was one of the lost. The rescue mission is a race against the clock. Annie Vaughn and Tom are stuck at 26000 feet where humans cant survive for long. And then theres the explosion factor. Peter and his team opt to carry cannisters of powerful easily triggered TNT so they can blow a hole in the snow canopy over the trapped climbers. The slightest jostle or exposure to sunlight and everyones mountain chum. The less said about the characterizations the better. However its a blessing to see non-demeaning depictions of Pakistanis and Muslims including a charming cameo by Indian actor Roshan Seth as a Pakistani colonel. Mainly ""Vertical Limit"" much of it shot on New Zealand mountain ranges is about cheating nature at its tallest its coldest and its loneliest. And director Campbell leads a great movie team to evoke that experience. The stunt work editing and special effects are remarkable. And director of photography David Tattersall (who also shot ""Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace"" and ""The Green Mile"") creates some powerful images including a heart-stopping point of view shot (as someone slides down a slope to their possible doom) that vicariously brings the audience to the very edge of the mountain. But dont worry. If you place your feet firmly around the legs of your chair and grip your partners arm you should be able to save yourself. ""Vertical Limit"" (PG-13 124 minutes) - Contains obscenity sickening deaths and bone fractures - and some hilariously bad character moments.

The opening sequence is pure dizzy heaven. A group of climbers is scaling one of the gorgeous mesas in Moab Utah when out of nowhere an overstuffed backpack goes tumbling down into the void. It hits a climber a rope jerks a body flies his rope yanks another climber and suddenly after much screaming and falling and scrambling over slippery red rock were left with three people -- brother (Chris ODonnell) sister (Robin Tunney) and father (Stuart Wilson) -- dangling from a single rope which is about to dislodge itself from its measly crevice. At this point I had a vicarious vertigo peak experience. The rest of the movie doesnt live up to that prelude. Its the story of a rescue mission atop K2 and though the director Martin Campbell (The Mask of Zorro) is out to do nothing more than stage a vivid and shuddery B movie the tingly suspense of stretching-chasm paranoia is mixed in with a fair amount of bombastic overkill. In a sequence that typifies Vertical Limit far more than that jaw-dropping opener does two climbers are hanging by a hook from an icy cliff when a canister of nitroglycerin tumbles and explodes producing a fireball more eruptive than anything in Lethal Weapon 4 at which point one of the climbers stands atop the cliff safe and sound just long enough to watch a snowy avalanche surge over him like a tidal wave devouring a minnow. The sequence is as gripping as anything in say Cliffhanger but Vertical Limit by laying on disasters with a trowel misses the chance to sweep us up into a more elegant fantasy of primitive mountaintop terror. The plot has been cobbled together from cliches that it would be polite to call serviceable. Bill Paxton bearded and smug is the heartless tycoon whose drive to stage a publicity stunt atop K2 ends up stranding him and two other climbers in a snowed-in catacomb. Chris ODonnell who really needs to play a bad guy (hes starting to resemble a cryogenically preserved teen idol) is the rescuer still grappling with his guilt over his fathers death. There is revenge some good nitro jitters and way too much flaccid whos-going-to-volunteer-for-the-mission dialogue. As a stringy-haired Zen climber who comes out of isolation to lead the rescue Scott Glenn isnt just grizzled hes downright grizzly but hes the one actor on hand who stands a bit taller than a molehill.

""Cliffhanger"" meets ""The Wages of Fear"" in ""Vertical Limit"" a high-altitude thriller that remains exciting as long as it stays on the mountains which is most of the time. Spiked with a number of breath-shortening action scenes and enough perilous moments for a whole season of old Saturday matinee serials this brawny suspenser features typically one-dimensional characters but more than fills the bill as roller-coaster-ride entertainment which translates into muscular holiday B.O. domestically and a significantly larger haul internationally. Once again proving his skill with straightforward physical filmmaking (previously demonstrated in ""GoldenEye"" and ""The Mask of Zorro"") director Martin Campbell clearly relishes sequences that demand inventive visual solutions for the staging of intensely dangerous situations. Wasting no time he delivers one right off the bat an eight-minute prologue that will put many viewers hearts in their throats despite its strong resemblance to the openings of both ""Cliffhanger"" and ""MI2."" On the sheer red cliff of a towering butte in Monument Valley bro and sis Peter and Annie Garrett (Chris ODonnell Robin Tunney) are doing some technical climbing with their expert climber dad Royce (Stuart Wilson). In a horrible accident they get tangled up with two other mountaineers leaving five adults dangling from a single rope. The two strangers quickly plummet to their deaths and after a few moments of gasping indecision Royce warns that the line wont hold long and demands that his son cut him loose to have any hope of saving himself and his sister. Faced with this impossible but urgent dilemma and ignoring Annies hysterical protests Peter obeys his father. Three years later Peter is a National Geographic lenser photographing (in lovely footage) snow leopards in the Himalayas. In short order he ends up at a Pakistani military installation where some very big guns point straight toward India and then at a K2 base camp where he has a delicate reunion with Annie. In the intervening period since their fathers death Peter has abandoned mountaineering while Annie has become a hotshot climber and Sports Illustrated cover girl whose current gig has her accompanying billionaire entrepreneur Elliot Vaughn (Bill Paxton) on a rapid ascent of K2. Setting up a luxurious compound that resembles a high-tech Club Med the arrogantly confident Elliot has surrounded himself with the best team that his limitless money can buy including expert climber Tom McLaren (Nicholas Lea) who is supposed to lead Elliot to the summit of the worlds second-highest peak in time to coincide with a fly-over of a plane from Elliots new airline. His commercial motive for the ascent makes the businessman the nominal villain a status further amplified by the selfish way he treats his colleagues when the crises commence which Campbell and screenwriters Robert King and Terry Hayes make sure happens sooner rather than later. At 26000 feet when severe weather hits Elliot Annie and Tom end up inside a deep cavern that shortly becomes sealed by an avalanche. With just 36 hours until his sister and the men will certainly expire a galvanized Peter takes charge of the rescue attempt quickly assembling a team of diverse and sometimes strange characters who stand only an outside chance of reaching the reckless climbers. Crew includes supermodelish medic and climber Monique (Izabella Scorupco looking even more stunning than she did in her last Campbell pic ""GoldenEye"") upright Pakistani porter Kareem (Alexander Siddig) wild Aussie hippie brothers Cyril and Malcolm Bench (Steve Le Marquand Ben Mendelsohn) and enigmatic hardcase Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn) a long-ago friend of Peter and Annies father whos been a mountain recluse since his wife died in an incident that gives him a secret personal agenda against Elliot. Not only does this ill-assorted bunch have to rush up what may be the worlds most perilous mountain but must do so carrying canisters of nitroglycerin which will enable the rescuers to blast through to the snow and rock that enshroud the trio. As viewers of ""The Wages of Fear"" will recall just the slightest undue jostling or contact will make nitro blow and the very idea that climbers could imagine carrying the stuff on a rugged ascent is merely the unlikeliest of the storys numerous hokey elements. But all the narrative contortions exist to enable Campbell to do what he does best which is to ratchet up tension and put across scenes of intense peril and imminent death with visceral impact. First of these has a helicopter taking the six hardy souls up as high as it can to a cliffside drop-off at which the climbers each packing nitro must jump clear while the chopper lurches dangerously about in the thin air. This is nothing however compared with the next action sequence which contains what may be the shot of the year As Cyril slides helplessly down a severe slope the camera descends at breathtaking speed with him at ground level then continues way out over a yawning gorge as Cyril just manages to hook his pickax into the ice leaving him dangling from the edge with only the faintest hope that Monique might be able to rescue him. That the rescue attempt itself comes at the last possible minute is a given and the resolutions of certain significant story strands are outfitted with some pat but sweet ironies. Although a fair amount of the toughest scenes were accomplished with an assist from blue-screen shooting traveling mattes models soundstage work and computerized visual effects the film has a predominantly real look and feel. Working on outstanding Southern Alps locations in New Zealand that convincingly match mountain vistas caught by Pakistani unit director/lenser Roger J. Vernon in the Himalayas Campbell and cinematographer David Tattersall keep the camera moving in muscular fashion throughout. Pic has virtually no flab and action-suspense scenes in particular have been cut to maximum effect. Perfs are one-note but competent ODonnell fairly wreaks boyish determination the very fit-looking Tunney well embodies feminine grit Paxton casts deep shadows on the mystique of the self-made man and Glenn manages to summon simultaneous impressions of Chuck Norris and Jeremiah Johnson as a loner whose face looks as stony as his habitat. Pic is subtly hip to national and ethnic stereotypes in cardboard characters be they stoners from Oz an uncompassionate tycoon from Texas or sympathetic Muslims from Pakistan.
