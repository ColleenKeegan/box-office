On one hand its a featherlight surprisingly broad comedy which swallows the hippie-dream propaganda whole; on the other its a winningly un-cynical warmly nostalgic tale of simple self-discovery.Gay Jewish and desperately seeking purpose Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) leaves his liberated NYC existence to help his parents with their crumbling rustic motel upstate. Hearing about a major rock festival seeking a home Elliott offers his small hometown as a venue the motel as mission control and his own services as local liaison.Anyone with an ounce of scepticism about the hippie myth will be infuriated by Taking Woodstock a film so starry-eyed and winsome it would make Joni Mitchell blush. But leave those preconceptions at the door and theres a lot to enjoy here hipster stand-up Martin is agreeably off-kilter in his first feature role backed  by a dizzying array of memorable supporting players notably Imelda Staunton channeling Mel Brooks as Elliots crotchety Nazi-obsessed mother and Brit theatre and TV actor Henry Goodman in a remarkable turn as put-upon dad Jake. But the real star is Lees direction. Goosing Godard with an epic track through traffic loading the screen with whirling naked bodies withholding the epic scale of the festival until Elliot (and the cinematography) are blitzed to the gills on LSD this may be a minor movie but it displays the hallmarks of a major talent.Read an interview with the director here By Tom Huddleston Posted Tuesday November 10 2009 Details Release details Rated 15 Release date Friday November 13 2009 Duration 120 mins Cast and crew Director Ang Lee Screenwriter James Schamus Cast Demetri MartinHenry GoodmanImelda StauntonEmile HirschLiev SchreiberEugene LevyJonathan GroffPaul DanoKelli GarnerJeffrey Dean Morgan Users say (5) 3 out of 5 stars Average User Rating3.8 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star04 star33 star02 star01 star0LiveReviews|51 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshNov 11 2010Kathy Jo in CincinnatiFeaturedMy husband and I watched this on NetFlix last night and we loved it Today I looked at the awful reviews and it only confirmed not to read them.

I particularly liked the way Ang Lee didint spell out that the son was gay/bi/whatever or get hung up on his friend who was seemingly transvestite. The movie showed lovely subtle ways of how things could have been back then- the clothes the cars... OK it wasnt totally groundbreaking but I thought it very endearing. I wish Id have been there anywayFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 19 2009philmkFeaturedJasgurs Farm is a memorable name in the American cultural mythology of the 20th century and this film embellishes the myth. Partly it is an homage to the original film of the original Woodstock festival on which Martin Scorsese was assistant director. It uses a similar split screen technique to depict simultaneous events and the same event from different angles. At times it could have been the original documentary unfortunately without much of the music. Most of all this was enjoyable lightweight fun. Unfortunately some people will be offended by the sight of young people enjoying themselves.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 15 2009usman khawajaFeaturedwoodstock takes you for a joyride with a lot of hippies lsd and marihuana addicts and semi -closeted homosexuals alongside some truly freaked out dysfunctional humanity which america abounds in its glorious dream and hefty bosom . the premise is a mass concert held in a suburban village in newyork in 1969 where all the scum gathers to celebrate drugspromote human rights and civil liberties in the name of free music . it actually indulges in showing some freaks in the nude and others sermonising in frredom of spirit and mind and is one of the most moronic self -indulgent trashy cinematic experiences of anytime . ang lee seems to be really fatigued after creating lust caution and brokeback and here he is taking a vacartion but why torture the movie goers - take a break and spare our senses too if you have lost your own directions . as for TIMEOUT they have lost all credibility and i am not surprised the hall was empty on a saturday in central london as this is an abysmal intolerable blasphemy from the nerdy male lead to emile hirsh who made an obligatory appearance along with liev schreiber -the essential and typical references to gays and jews and stonewall were enough to make this a one-note crap lacking any humour or any comic quality whatsoever -a dull disgusting and depressing drama not worth a penny .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 28 2009Tom WellesFeaturedAwful out-of-touch clueless film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87174/taking-woodstock.html,200,takingwoodstock1,takingwoodstock,timeout

Powerful emotions powerfully restrained. That has been a hallmark of Ang Lees movies since his first Taiwanese productions and it has only become clearer in his American work. Connecticut suburbanites 19th-century aristocrats New West cowboys -- they all struggle mightily to contain their secret urges. Until one day fatefully -- perhaps fatally -- they cant. Taking Woodstock (R) Focus (120 min.) Directed by Ang Lee. With Demetri Martin Liev Schreiber Imelda Staunton Jonathan Groff Eugene Levy. Now playing in New York; opens Friday in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys Rating TWO STARS Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations substance abuse and violence That theme which you can find in Lee movies as diverse as ""Hulk"" and ""Lust Caution"" reaches a generational climax in ""Taking Woodstock"" a film about the staging of the epochal 1969 concert. Its a conflict between old and new straight-laced and wide-open -- and unfortunately between Lee and his collaborators. Lees directorial work here is typically excellent. In scenes of the promoters setting up the stage (and the ""freaks"" descending on the tiny Catskills town) he uses the same split screens and overlapping editing that Michael Wadleigh made famous in his original concert film; in the (almost obligatory) acid-trip sequence the colors swirl like melting paintings. But Lee is let down on other fronts. James Schamus has written many of Lees scripts (although not for two of his best films ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Sense and Sensibility"") and the two clearly understand each others strengths. Yet too much of ""Taking Woodstock"" seems barely sketched out. Of course the story itself takes place deliberately on the edges of history. It details the true story of how a shy kid with a failing motel (Elliot Tiber on whose memoir the film is based) helped broker the deal that brought ""3 Days of Peace and Music"" to a nearby dairy farm (and utter chaos to much of upstate New York). The movie is thus about Eliots personal revolution not the one happening onstage; there are no lookalikes lip-synching to Janis and Jimi no restagings of sets by Santana or the Airplane. Like most of the people who attended the best we get are snatches of music in the distance. Yet for a movie based on a real persons memoir very little in ""Taking Woodstock"" feels singular or even real. A self-medicating veteran who keeps having flashbacks is identical to ones weve seen in so many other movies; a motherly-but-macho drag queen seems to have wandered in from ""The World According to Garp."" Even our hero isnt much of a presence; hes more of a nebbish with a crudely domineering mother. Eliot needs some spark of personality but Demetri Martin a hot alternative comic who unwisely let someone convince him he was an actor too cant provide it. Hes got a bad case of the mopes and its catching. The rest of the performances are all over the place. Jonathan Groff a stage actor from ""Spring Awakening"" and the recent ""Hair"" revival makes a terrific movie debut as festival organizer Michael Lang; hes got the real Langs elfin but ultimately unreadable smile down pat. But as Elliots mother the usually immaculate Imelda Staunton all but attacks the scenery with a knife and fork. There are some amusements along the way including a terrible (and frequently nude) avant-garde theater troupe and Liev Schreiber as a Marine in a housedress. Theres also some forced nudge-nudge foreshadowing as when Lang talks about that upcoming Stones concert hes involved with. You know Altamont. Whoa. Bummer. But even coupled with Lees careful filmmaking thats not enough for two hours of movie -- or even a fresh sideways look at a famous event. For that you might want to search out another Schreiber film about that subject the adultery drama ""A Walk on the Moon."" Or even -- heres a novel idea -- the original crunchy-granola documentary itself. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Taking Woodstock Comedy-drama. Starring Demetri Martin Imelda Staunton Jonathan Groff and Liev Shreiber. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Anyone familiar with the ""Woodstock"" documentary might recall several people saying over the course of the three-day festival that the concert ""has become a city."" That impression though spoken was never quite conveyed in the documentary but director Ang Lee captures it in ""Taking Woodstock"" a true story based on the memoirs of Elliot Tiber the man who found a home for the concert in Bethel N.Y. In ""Taking Woodstock"" the concert is so big that its impossible to stand above it and grasp it all. You can only get a piece of it. It is as one character puts it ""the center of the universe"" exerting an influence and a gravitational pull on everything surrounding it. The concert isnt one story but a million stories and if youve ever wondered what it would be like to be there - to actually be there man - this movie gets it. Or maybe it just gets the dream but thats even better. ""Taking Woodstock"" has the appeal of an inside story told from an especially good angle. But beyond that the movie is a celebration of the way this event has gone into memory and of the meaning it has acquired. Lee acknowledges this - that hes filming the memory not the reality - by borrowing cinematic techniques directly from Michael Wadleighs ""Woodstock"" documentary such as the use of split screen and a certain predilection for Crosby Stills and Nash on the soundtrack.

Mamie Gummer stars as Tisha in Academy Award-winning director Ang Lees Taking Woodstock a Focus Features release. Photo Ken Regan Focus Features Review Taking Woodstock 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Here and there Lee makes use of a grainy film stock to give shots a rough-and-ready documentary feel. At one point he shows the ""Woodstock"" cameramen filming the iconic shot of nuns walking into the concert and he re-creates the famous scene of people sliding in the mud. In the process he turns something that previously looked sloppy and drug-induced into something joyous. Throughout Lee aims for a feeling - that specific sense that sometimes comes over us when were young of moving through a golden moment and knowing it. And so the scene in which our hero Elliot (Demetri Martin) takes LSD in a van with a hippie couple seems neither squalid nor dangerous but rather like some warm and cozy rite of passage. Turns out all this magic descended on a very unlikely place. At the start of the story Elliot is working in his parents disgusting rundown motel in upstate New York. His parents are Russian Jewish immigrants - his father (Henry Goodman) passive to the point of inertia; his mother (Imelda Staunton) bitter angry and greedy. Elliot is a beleaguered fellow a dutiful son but he has one claim to local fame Hes the guy in Bethel who has the right to issue permits. Nobody else wanted the job. So when he reads that the Woodstock festival has lost its permit in a nearby town he contacts the promoters and invites them to Bethel. Overnight his life transforms. Michael Lang (the guy with the big hair in the Woodstock movie played here by Jonathan Groff) shows up with an entourage and bags of cash. Elliots parents horrible motel becomes the festivals base of operation and into his life comes a series of vivid and free-spirited characters - including Liev Schreiber as an ex-Marine drag queen - who show him a bigger world. In real life Elliot already knew he was gay and lived a gay life but the movie - emphasizing the liberating effect of Woodstock - leaves Elliots past experience vague. Much of the movie shows Elliot navigating between the old world and the new dealing with the townspeople who resent the hippie invasion and the hippies who are younger and freer than Elliot is. At times the story feels a bit rote and the movie suffers a bit from having such a passive protagonist although Martin is an engaging actor. Fortunately the movie grows as it goes along. There are two acting surprises in ""Taking Woodstock."" The first is that it contains the first bad performance by Emile Hirsch. He plays a Vietnam veteran and I believed him about as much as Id believe my cat in the role. And the second is Eugene Levy who excels in a relatively straight role as Max Yasgur on whose farm the concert took place. -- Advisory Nudity sexual situations lots of drug use.

(Focus Features) Joe Neumaier Thursday August 27 2009 247 PM Title Taking Woodstock How to telescope a sprawling culturally crucial event like Woodstock? Go too small and its ""one hippies groovy weekend"" Try for ""big meaning"" and the intention of the 1969 music festival may get lost. Director Ang Lee and screenwriter James Schamus found a way to combine those ideas by focusing on a guy who helped make it happen.The result ""Taking Woodstock"" is something of a traffic jam--even with his usual restraint Lee couldnt recount a key moment of the 60s without a blurry parade of personalities--and also lullingly dull. Still theres a pleasant calmness here too an appreciation for keeping cool while all around you are feeding their heads.Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) keeps the books at his aging immigrant parents (Imelda Staunton Henry Goodman) motel in Bethel N.Y. The Tibers happen to possess the towns only festival permit which Elliot takes advantage of when he hears of a music event with big names getting bumped from the nearby village of Wallkill.Soon Tiber has finagled the use of a dairy farm belonging to Max Yasgur (a nicely wry Eugene Levy) while the fests organizers (led by Jonathan Groff as Michael Lang) descend upon the motel. As local shopkeepers and residents try to cancel it people arrive at Maxs farm in droves and dont leave until well after the last chord of ""Hey Joe.""Woodstock of course had many fathers and all have claimed to be the force behind it. But Tiber--who told his side of the story in a 2007 memoir--is actually a cinematically unsatisfying choice though his life is revealed to be far more colorful in his book; here as played by Martin Tiber is too passive and officious. Nothing shakes him from his turning on with a hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) to his friendship with a shell-shocked Vietnam vet (Emile Hirsch) to his affair with a construction worker to witnessing history in action.Luckily actors like Staunton Groff and Liev Schreiber are around to liven things up. Schreibers Vilma in particular--a transvestite ex-Marine grandfather who provides some strong-armed security for the Tibers--does the film a great favor by working on several levels.Lee in his best work (""Sense and Sensibility"" ""The Ice Storm"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" ""Brokeback Mountain"") finds new emotional ground within familiar terrain. Its great that ""Taking Woodstock"" doesnt trample on anything sacred but it also never arrives anywhere interesting.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Three weekends later about a half-million people attended or tried to attend the Woodstock music festival -- three days of peace love and music that still stand as an emblem for all that was groovy and messy about the late 60s. In anticipation of the concerts 40th anniversary Michael Wadleighs Woodstock documentary was released in a directors cut on DVD and Blu-ray. And on Aug. 14 a day before the exact anniversary Ang Lees Taking Woodstock opened in U.S. theaters although it had its world premiere weeks prior at Cannes. (See the top 10 Cannes Film Festival movies of all time.) This is one of those little movies set against a big event like I Wanna Hold Your Hand (how four girls got into Ed Sullivans theater to see the Beatles) or Love Field (Diane Lane as a JFK fan in Dallas on Nov. 22 1963). Lees film is screenwriter-producer James Schamus adaptation of Elliot Tibers reminiscence about his small but crucial role in bringing the mammoth concert to his hometown. The films Elliot (Comedy Centrals Demetri Martin) is a New York City decorator whos come back to his Catskills home to help his parents manage their decrepit motel which is facing bankruptcy in the early summer of 69. His parents (Brit theatrical lights Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton) are as eager for him to stay there forever as he is determined to leave. But when he reads that the Woodstock festival planned for that August has been denied a permit in a nearby town he calls the promoters and invites them to White Lake and its neighboring town Bethel where farmer Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy) might be willing to rent it to them for 5000. Make that 75000 when he learns how desperate they are. Lee who was born and raised in Taiwan and didnt head to the States until the late 70s has often shown an outsiders acuity in portraying the subtleties and sadness of American folkways. His The Ice Storm set in 1973 and Brokeback Mountain which spans three decades beginning in the 60s couldnt be more simpatico with the quiet desperation of ordinary folks. In this ostensible comedy though his ear is tin his eye myopic. The right-wing townsfolk artsy theater people and visiting hippies come across as the shallowest stereotypes. Lees attempts to imitate the split-screen and psychedelic cinema tricks of the period have nowhere near the originals garish grandeur. The business end of the Woodstock enterprise holds some interest but the family dynamic is sitcom-broad and contains a near libelous caricature of immigrant Jews. Maybe Elliots mother really was a screaming tightfisted tyrant and his father the standard henpecked husband. And maybe Lee couldnt find American actors whod fit his view of these cartoon creatures. But to outfit Staunton in a housedress that is gargantuanly padded in the bosom and butt is to force an exceptional actress into unintended parody and to reduce the Holocaust-survivors generation to Borscht Belt jokes. Staunton has made a long trip south from Oscar-nominated actress to Vera Drake yenta. A few actors crawl out of the rubble. Give Jonathan Groff (a major new cutie) a hand for turning the Woodstock weekends chief promoter Michael Lang into a figure so charismatic and so central to the actual concert that viewers will think the movie should have been about him. Liev Schreiber also earns credit for not being buried under the stereotype of a muscular cross-dresser who serves as Elliots security chief. The vaunted Broadway actor shows something we hadnt seen before nice legs The rest of the movie is a mess -- Lees first total miscalculation his first wholly inessential film. Hell do better; he almost has to. The rest of us with any interest in a 40-year-old rock concert can get the DVD of Woodstock and maybe sing along to a new version of Joni Mitchells tune Im going on down to Wadleighs film Im going to have a cinematic blast Where the music lives tho its from the past And the film aint by Ang Lee.

"Taking Woodstock Kindling | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTaking Woodstock KindlingExtremely trivial pursuit Who polished Neil Armstrongs lunar stepladder? Who sold Betsy Ross thread for the first U.S. flag? Who served Gen. Custer breakfast on the morning of his Last Stand?Ang Lees Taking Woodstock focuses on the bit players including Jonathan Groffs Michael Lang left and Demetri Martins Elliot Teichberg.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 28 2009 Extremely trivial pursuit Who polished Neil Armstrongs lunar stepladder? Who sold Betsy Ross thread for the first U.S. flag? Who served Gen. Custer breakfast on the morning of his Last Stand?The answers are lost to antiquity (and Google) but thanks to the diligence of filmmaker Ang Lee we have the solution more or less to another vexing historical footnote Who rented the motel rooms to the guys who did the Woodstock Festival?Elliot Teichberg is that momentous innkeeper. Lees enshrinement of this fact in Taking Woodstock owes more to his desire to make a comedy after numerous dramas and to Teichbergs relentless self-promotion than to any serious pursuit of history.Can you dig it? Maybe if you arent already up to your tie-dyed shorts in Woodstock memories and if you can accept that theres relatively little music in this happy-go-lucky movie about historys most celebrated music festival. It wants to get back to the garden but remains on the cobbled footpath.Article Continued BelowWith no real point to make Lee and screenwriter James Schamus simply get high from the fumes offering a character-rich ramble thats more like Robert Altmans Nashville than Michael Wadleighs Woodstock. To be fair to Teichberg (or Tiber as he now prefers) he may have been a small cog in the Woodstock wheel but he was an important one. It was his phone call to concert promoter Michael Lang that helped bring Woodstock to the hamlet of White Lake N.Y. and the 600 green acres of dairy farmer Max Yasgur after the town of Wallkill had reneged on its festival permission. Teichberg sweetly rendered by comedian Demetri Martin in the film also helped run the El Monaco the dilapidated family-run motel that was on the verge of bankruptcy before the Age of Aquarius arrived on the doorstep. Much is made too much of the penny-pinching by Teichbergs mother Sonia (Imelda Staunton) and father Jake (Henry Goodman).The camera rarely strays from the El Monaco leaving the festival and its 500000 attendees mainly in the background. Artistic decisions (not to mention licensing rights) means the music of Woodstock is barely heard in the distance and theres just one quick shot of the stage from a high hill. There is no archival footage; no famous musicians are seen.Teichbergs flowering as a closeted gay man who blooms amongst the flower children is the main subject of fascination for Lee and Schamus although audiences may choose to differ.Most of the supporting players are played for laughs and they do raise a smile. Liev Schreiber is Vilma a transvestite ex-Marine hired for security who packs a pistol beneath his skirt. Emile Hirsch is Vietnam burnout Billy who possibly had a larger role that now lies on the editing room floor. And Paul Dano is simply ""VW Guy"" a concert attendee and stoner who takes Teichberg on a trip that brings the slow-moving film to grinding halt in a purple haze.Much better presented is Jonathan Groffs Michael Lang who uncannily looks and acts like the real Woodstock dude and Eugene Levys Max Yasgur who shows us the shrewd businessman behind the genial farmer the world briefly met in Wadleighs Oscar-winning Woodstock documentary.Speaking of Wadleigh Lee hat-tips his Woodstock predecessor with a glimpse of a doc crew interviewing a honey-dipper guy who is just like the real outhouse cleaner seen in Woodstock.

If you can remember it so the old joke goes you probably werent there. Former flower children who were on the scene and on psychotropics for those three fab far-out days but are hazy on the details and those who werent there but want to know what happened wont get much help from ""Taking Woodstock"" the gentle ambling Ang Lee comedy thats a few tokes short of groovy. ENLARGE Demetri Martin in blue shirt plays Elliot Tiber in Ang Lees Taking Woodstock. Focus Features Mr. Lee has said in interviews that he didnt want to make a concert film and he has succeeded Theres no concert here no Joan Baez/Jefferson Airplane/John Sebastian/Janis Joplin performance footage in ""Taking Woodstock."" Its a situation akin to ""Julie amp; Julia"" without a kitchen and the songs by Melanie Richie Havens Ravi Shankar and the Grateful Dead that make up the soundtrack place the movie in the 60s without particularly placing it at ground zero. In fact the festival seems to be little more than a backdrop for the filmmakers chief focus The coming of age of Elliot Tiber ne Teichberg (Demetri Martin) from whose memoir ""Taking Woodstock"" was adapted. Thats fine. Rather that could have been fine. Often the best way into the story of a significant event or epoch is through a bystander or a minor player. Consider the Cameron Crowe stand-in played by Patrick Fugit in ""Almost Famous."" But neither Elliots story nor Mr. Martins performance offers much in the way of drama or wattage. A closeted homosexual the diffident Elliot puts his Manhattan life on hold to help shore up the family business--a seedy Catskills motel with the improbably grand name El Monaco--that is being managed or rather mismanaged by his loony domineering Holocaust-survivor mother (Imelda Staunton) and his browbeaten father (Henry Goodman). Amenities are few guests fewer and the mortgage payment long overdue. Hearing that the neighboring town has revoked a permit for a music festival and sensing an opportunity to improve the familys fortunes while freeing himself from a parental death grip Elliot phones one of the events producer/promoters (Jonathan Groff) to offer his help and his hostelry. The very good Mr. Groff deftly combines a businessmans cool focus with a stoners beatific vibe. ""Taking Woodstock"" mines all the cultural touchstones of the era and rounds up all the stereotypes as though checking off a to-do list. Theres the televised shot of the moon landing; the traumatized Vietnam veteran; the acid trip on the VW bus (just one of several overextended underwhelming sequences); the uptight characters freed of inhibitions after their unsuspecting consumption of hash brownies. And theres an avant-garde theater troupe that establishes its bona fides as hip and happening by stripping. One scene of baring all makes the point very nicely. Twice suggests a poverty of inventiveness on someones part. Perhaps as a sign that the times they will soon be a-changin big time Liev Schreiber has a turn as a cross-dressing former marine whose example nudges Elliot toward cliched self-acceptance. After ""The Ice Storm"" the Oscar-winning ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Lust Caution"" Mr. Lee may well have wanted to lighten up and journey in a different direction. ""Taking Woodstock"" is hardly a bad trip; just a very inconsequential one. The September Issue In the last minutes of the documentary ""The September Issue""--R.J. Cutlers behind-the-scenes look at the birth of a behemoth (the four-pound September 2007 issue of the fashion bible Vogue)--Anna Wintour the magazines legendary long-time editor-in-chief considers a rack of clothes for possible inclusion in the October issue. ""So"" she says clearly dissatisfied with whats been set before her ""what else?"" ENLARGE Vogue editor Anna Wintour is the imperious center of the documentary The September Issue. Roadside Attractions; My sentiments exactly. The press notes boast that Mr. Cutler was given ""unprecedented access"" and the right of final cut; these advantages dont seem to have done much for this listless film. It doesnt help of course that movies like ""The Devil Wears Prada"" an adaptation of Lauren Weisbergers vengeful roman a clef about a magazine modeled on Vogue and an editor modeled on Ms. Wintour and ""Ugly Betty"" the popular TV series set at a glossy fashion magazine have demystified such supposedly recherche activities as photo shoots fashion shows editorial confabs energetic debates about accessories or the need for the cover subject (in this case actress Sienna Miller) to wear a wig. Thus a scene that shows Ms. Wintour voicing barely concealed displeasure about the muted palette of a new collection and the designer trying to convince her that dark green is too a color doesnt register as dramatically as it might have a decade ago. Even so Mr. Cutler surely must have thought hed caught lightning in a bottle when Ms. Wintour came on board. The woman whos described in a voice-over as ""the single most important figure in the 300 billion fashion world""--and no not simply ""the high priestess"" but ""the pope""--has been the focus of myriad magazine and newspaper stories. All tend to center on her ever-present sunglasses and her ever-present hauteur. Unfortunately for audiences Ms. Wintour perhaps mindful of her icy reputation perhaps simply mindful of the cameras is on her best behavior cool and distant with an occasional faint twinkle of humor. We learn that shes a fool for her family and that shed like a better backhand but nothing that wed really like to know What happens when she cools on a designer? How has Vogue evolved during her tenure? In an industry where change is the only thing you can count on how has she held on for 20 years? How would she define her personal style? (It does seem to involve a necklace with flat amber beads that she wears throughout the documentary.) Despite the movies use of bulletins apparently to add a sense of urgency and suspense to the proceedings--three months until the close of the issue six weeks a month a week etc.--its a completely false sense of urgency. None of the doings on-screen suggest a desperate race against the clock. A larger problem is that fashion is all about the moment--this moment. ""The September Issue"" is old news all the more so given the recent recession-driven transformation of the magazine landscape. Because Ms. Wintours lightest word is law--this keeps meetings brief and conversations briefer--and because the magazines staff communicates in the shorthand of glances and gestures and seems experienced at heading trouble off at the pass nothing much happens in ""The September Issue."" The only drama--much needed--is provided by Vogues creative director Grace Coddington. A former model with an incomparable style sense Ms. Coddington rolls her eyes extravagantly and expresses outrage and frustration to colleagues and to the camera when her boss shortens a carefully assembled fashion folio or rejects the clothes that have been painstakingly chosen for a shoot. In her editors letter in the September 2009 issue of Vogue Ms. Wintour makes a point of applauding Ms. Coddingtons verve and creativity. Nowhere in ""The September Issue"" does Ms. Coddington return the compliment. DVD FOCUS Funny Face (1957) ENLARGE The sublime Kay Thompson is Maggie Prescott (read Diana Vreeland) the autocratic editor of fashion bible Quality (read Vogue). When she decrees that the magazine must have a new image--a woman whos both gorgeous and brainy--Maggie puts her favorite photographer on the case. That would be none other than Dick Avery (Fred Astaire channeling Richard Avedon). He finds just the girl hes looking for (Audrey Hepburn) shelving dusty volumes in a Greenwich Village bookstore. But shes got far loftier things on her mind than modeling. George and Ira Gershwin supplied the music and lyrics. Thompson Astaire and Hepburn supplied the magic. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) ENLARGE The devil gets her due in a movie thats leagues better than its source material Lauren Weisbergers jejune roman a clef about a young womans tenure as assistant to one Miranda Priestley the imperious capricious editor of a fashion magazine. The novel is centered on the beleaguered assistant; the focus of the movie is Miranda-- and how could it be otherwise with the glorious Meryl Streep giving a nuanced performance in the title role? Her hair stylishly cropped and tinted the silvery-gray of a Rolls Royce she strikes terror but also admiring awe in the hearts of her minions. These include Anne Hathaway the brilliant Stanley Tucci (Ms. Streeps husband in the current ""Julie amp; Julia"") and Emily Blunt in a hilarious memorable turn as Mirandas senior aide. The Ice Storm (1997) ENLARGE Its Thanksgiving 1973 in New Canaan Conn. and the roads have frozen in Ang Lees elegant shattering adaptation of the Rick Moody novel. But the big chill is hardly reserved for the outdoors. Its there in the home of Jim and Janey Carver (Jamey Sheridan and Sigourney Weaver); its there in the home of their neighbors Ben and Elena Hood (Kevin Kline and Joan Allen). In the face of political and social upheaval spouses commit joyless adultery attend ""key parties"" self-medicate with alcohol and lose track of their children. --Joanne Kaufman Find television listings at LocateTV.

For ""Taking Woodstock"" Lee and his collaborator James Schamus have turned the tale into an anthropological comedy by adapting Elliot Tibers memoir ""Taking Woodstock A True Story of a Riot a Concert a Life"" into a film. Tiber played by comic Demetri Martin serves as the guide in this story which has him moving from New York City to the El Monaco Motel in White Lake N.Y. to help his parents the Teichbergs -- distant father Jake (Henry Goodman) and biting mother Sonia (Imelda Staunton) -- keep their dump. When a nearby town pulls the plug on a music festival sure to attract crowds of the unwashed the blissed-out and the anti-war young Elliot offers the El Monaco as a headquarters. Hell Monaco is more like it. Too dutiful a son he is also a budding interior decorator. And no that is not code for the fact Elliot is a fledgling gay man. Though he is. As Lee reminds us with mentions of Judy Garlands death and unrest in Greenwich Village this watershed happening occurred during the summer of Stonewall the milestone for the gay-rights movement. Elliots grand concert idea alienates many of his neighbors. An exception irascible dairy farmer Max Yasgur played with a wry contrarian streak by Eugene Levy. When Elliot is harangued at the local diner Yasgur just observes. But the wheels are a spinnin. Right neighborly payback comes when he offers his land to the festival organizers. The movie has fun with the notion that the festival came out of a crazy mash-up of the anarchic and the entrepreneurial. Naifs like Elliot helped and hampered a battalion of lawyers brought in by the promoters. Lees larkiest film by far ""Taking Woodstock"" features faces familiar and fresh. Emile Hirsch once again shows why he is becoming a serious talent. Sure his depiction of fractured Vietnam vet Billy feels at times like its taking place in a different film but it is sincerely watchable. Vilma (Liev Schreiber) arrives from Greenwich Village in high heels a bad frock and a worse wig. A former Marine he offers security for the Teichbergs and dishes up insights to Elliot about his folks. But it is big-screen newcomer Jonathan Groff who mesmerizes as concert producer Michael Lang. A success on Broadway in ""Spring Awakening"" Groff brings a knowingness and a sexiness to the role. Something in his mischievous eyes and calm grin sums up the hope and opportunism of the period. Staunton plays Sonia Teichberg as an uber-Jewish mother. Its unmitigated Borscht Belt shtick. And Sonia is the only character in which Lee doesnt seem to find something richer. Even with a startling revelation about Moms stunted makeup the broad comedy takes place at her expense. But then one should consider the source The film suggests Elliots desire to please her is equal to his contempt for her. The gravitas and tenderness typical of Lee the director of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""The Ice Storm"" can be found in the details the seemingly marginal moments. This is likely the comedys point. Once the festival is underway Elliot is forever trying to get to it. Its the journey man not the destination. Paul Dano (""There Will Be Blood"") plays ""VW Guy."" He and his groovy girlfriend act as tour guides to Elliots maiden LSD voyage. When the acid hits the movie plays with enhanced effects. But it all feels a little sociological. When Elliot mounts the back of a motorcycle to get to the music the slow-poke ride provides a pan of the variety of souls Woodstock stirred the bra burners the yoga practitioners the anti-war activists . . . On the mud-sludge grounds of Yasgurs property where the stage and other metal objects have become electrified by the rains Elliot has an exchange with Tisha (Mamie Gummer). As Langs floppy-hat-wearing Girl Friday shes been doing her own laid-back version of observing. Their exchange touches on the relationship between the cosmic and the familial the communal and the parental. Its a rather adult exchange for a story about youth culture at its grooviest.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 28 2009 Save for later Saved Mamie Gummer(l.) Jonathan Groff (c.) and Demetri Martin are shown in a scene from ""Taking Woodstock."" Ken Regan/ Focus Features/ AP          View Caption Demetri Martin (l.) and Eugene Levy are shown in a scene from ""Taking Woodstock."" Ken Regan/ Focus Features/ AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of It was inevitable that a dramatic feature about Woodstock would debut on the fabled festivals 40th anniversary but coupled with all the other tributes and DVD packages and interviews and look-backs and think pieces Im tempted to call for a moratorium on the whole shebang. I am a proud if somewhat jaded member of that tie-dyed generation but theres only so much hippie nostalgia I can endure.The drama in question Ang Lees ""Taking Woodstock"" is a bit like the festival itself - a happy mess. It was scripted by James Schamus and based on an eponymous memoir by Elliot Tiber subtitled ""A True Story of a Riot a Concert and a Life."" Elliot had been working as an interior designer in Greenwich Village N.Y. but moved to the Catskills to bail out his parents ramshackle motel. When a permit for what was originally billed as a small-scale neighboring music and arts festival is rescinded Elliot helps strike a deal to keep the show alive at a 600-acre dairy farm down the road. (The location was actually Bethel not Woodstock but Woodstock sounds better.) The rest is history and herstory.As played by Demetri Martin not a very galvanizing actor Elliot is both the center of the action and a witness to the maelstrom. His personal odyssey during the ""3 Days of Peace amp; Music"" as the festival was billed is intended to symbolize a generational passage. Living as a semicloseted homosexual the strait-laced Elliot locates a companionable vibe in Woodstock. He liberates himself along with 500000 other shaggy attendees. Although Lee reveals little of the festivities and concerts except from faraway he provides a marvelous extended sequence in which Elliot hitching a ride on a policemans motorcycle is ushered into the scene. The hippie (or would-be) hippie procession is like a fantasia. In only a few minutes we are treated to an inexhaustible gallery of painted faces and fads. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? This is perhaps the most authentic scene in a movie that otherwise despite its careful almost fetishistic attention to the look and feel of the experience seems counterfeit. Its inevitable that the hippie movement now seems as fixed in time as the Paleozoic Era but Lee encourages his actors to behave as if they were in a roadshow production of ""Hair."" In the case of Imelda Staunton who plays Elliots horribly overbearing Russian-Jewish immigrant mother shes such a stock caricature that the bottom drops out of the movie every time she waddles into view and as Elliots father Henry Goodman is only slightly less stock. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Taking Woodstock The film comes across as rather dim-witted because Lees take on Woodstock is almost entirely self-contained and un-ironic. (An exception One of Woodstocks producers played by Jonathan Groff alludes to an upcoming bliss-out at Altamont featuring the Rolling Stones.) Im not arguing that Lee should have front-loaded his film with posthippie hindsight. But its one thing to present Woodstock as if nothing came after it quite another to dramatize it as simply well ""3 Days of Peace amp; Music.""Even apart from its soundtrack the Michael Wadleigh documentary ""Woodstock"" was such a comprehensive take on the event that Lees movie was bound to suffer by comparison. But the documentary points up what is flagrantly wrongheaded about ""Taking Woodstock"" where the machinations of the producers and promoters lack any real bite or guile; the cavorters descending on the scene are without exception sweet-souled; and the acid trips including Elliots are fun-house frolics. The only really bad guys are the Mafia soldiers trying to muscle in on the scene and they are driven off as if they were country bumpkins. (Heading up security is a burly golden-tressed ex-Marine transvestite played by Liev Schrieber in what can best be described as a career stretch.)Lee may want to portray Woodstock as a shining moment in time but in doing so he barely gives lip service to what was roiling the country. Emile Hirsch playing a shellshocked Vietnam vet seems like just another giddily stoned soul mate. Lee works in occasional documentary footage of the Vietnam War or the Apollo moonwalk but these clips seem like bulletins from Neverland.Lee has always had an affinity for innocence and an abiding affection for outcasts and both traits serve him well in ""Taking Woodstock"" - but only up to a point. Beyond that point where sanctification meets reality the film floats up up and away. Its as if he decided to photoshop the Age of Aquarius and retain only the airhead naivete.

By COLIN COVERT August 27 2009 -- 619pm Focus Features Photo Credit Ken Regan Kelli Garner (left) Demetri Martin (center) and Paul Dano (right) star in Academy Award-winning director Ang Lees ""Taking Woodstock."" Photo Credit Ken Regan Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the summer of 1969 Americans were transfixed by two remarkable journeys. In July Neil Armstrong left footprints on the moon. In August half a million hippies invaded conservative upstate New York. In ""Taking Woodstock"" characters observe both events with bewildered awe. They dont quite get their minds around it but the film doesnt judge them harshly for that. Nearly half a century later were still debating the significance of the events ourselves. There is a lot to like about this flawed film foremost being the fact that it flouts every expectation we bring to it. ""Taking Woodstock"" makes unpredictable creative choices; were an hour into the film before we hear a snippet of pop music. The movie repeats moments from the 1970 documentary ""Woodstock"" but favors small human gestures over Dionysian freakouts. Director Ang Lee uses a vast canvas to tell a charming if somewhat muddled coming-of-age story. At the center of things is Elliot Teichberg (played by Demetri Martin with a groggy sweetness thats quite appealing). Hes a failed New York City painter who returns to the Catskills to help his harsh humorless Russian Jewish parents revive their ramshackle motel. Elliot is an idealistic rather dreamy sort at that crossroads in life where youthful alienation threatens to solidify into a life sentence of loserdom. He and his downtrodden dad (Henry Goodman) are bullied by his shrewish mother (Imelda Staunton as chafing as a Brillo pad). Elliot dutifully runs the tiny Chamber of Commerce where locals offer crackpot motions to boost the dying towns tourism. One favors building a monorail to Manhattan. A jolly bigot recommends driving the local Jews through the streets in a Pamplona-style cattle run. Life in poky Woodstock is a soul-quashing drag for Elliot who yearns for New York Citys freedom. You sense him longing to squirm out of his own skin. Hes an artistic soul happy to let a hippie theater troupe do their thing rent-free in the motels decrepit barn but afraid to cut loose himself. So when a team of organizers scout the town as a venue for a three day arts and culture fair Elliot sees a win-win. Especially since they pay their bills with grocery bags full of cash. Soon he and his community are in the midst of a countercultural tsunami -- part carnival part commercial steamroller. TAKING WOODSTOCK  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating R graphic nudity some sexual content drug use and language. Lee moves the story into high gear with montages and multi-split screens as flower children turn the town upside down. Ma and Pa Teichberg watch the freaks and skinny-dippers aghast until little by little theyre swept along in the feel-good flow. But the wind goes out of the storys sails in the last third and the film just loiters around. ""Taking Woodstock"" has fine moments and an enjoyable vibe but it never develops a coherent point of view. The writing is too laid back content to be facetious and fitfully amusing. For every intriguing character (such as Liev Schreibers grounded mature transvestite who becomes Elliots guide to self-acceptance) theres a stereotype (Emile Hirschs Nam vet wacko). For every entertaining stoner moment (Elliot flounders through a press conference high as a kite) theres a clunking cliche (hash brownies as the solution to family problems). The script doesnt dig much significance out of Woodstock except to say that Americas season of love was cruelly short. Bummer man.

Taking Woodstock is one of them a microcosm of the fabled occasion that brought rock-and-roll to Rip Van Winkle country.Ang Lees deadpan-comic account of the event sees the shaggy and fringe-vested horde through the bemused eyes of Elliot Teichberg (Demetri Martin) the real-life youth who helped promoters score the permit they needed to host the festival.Seeing the human circus from Elliots blinkered perspective provides the absurdist pleasure of watching a historic event through the wrong end of the telescope as though peering at Hamlet through Rosencrantz and Guildensterns peephole in Tom Stoppards Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.Martin the comedian with his own show on Comedy Central plays Elliot with the numb-faced raw-nerved attitude that Dustin Hoffman patented in The Graduate. Like that movies Benjamin Braddock and the generation that Woodstock defined Elliot Teichberg was in the process of finding himself as an American man a man very different from his Russian immigrant parents. And like Lee movies from The Wedding Banquet through Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain this one is about a younger generation breaking away from its elders.The elder Teichbergs the needling Sonia (Imelda Staunton) and needled Jake (Henry Goodman) are rustics facing foreclosure on the El Monaco their dilapidated motel with delusions of glamour which is slipping slowly into the swamp. Elliot who lives in Manhattan but continues to manage his parents business affairs is a would-be entrepreneur and accidental provocateur.Head of the Bethel chamber of commerce Elliot holds a permit for the annual arts festival. With dreams of paying off the mortgage he contacts the Woodstock promoters denied a permit for their ""Aquarian Festival"" offering them the El Monaco property and his permit.Elliots gesture small and insignificant as skipping a stone across a peaceful lake results in the event that parts the waters between dominant culture and counterculture a situation Lee and screenwriter James Schamus Lees longtime collaborator play for both the inherent slapstick and seriousness. Threading through the horde Elliot is offered LSD by two hippies and in his altered state has a vision of humanity as a synchronous wave.You can smell the incense and peppermint (and pot and sweat and cholent) wafting through the Catskills as Taking Woodstock shows how bucolic Sullivan County home to dairies and battered Borscht Belt resorts became ground zero of the Generation Gap. Under his nimbus of curls promoter Michael Lang (a peaced-out and wry performance from Jonathan Groff) promotes business and brotherhood among music execs and farmers.As Max Yasgur whose farm ultimately hosted the concert Eugene Levy gives the films warmest performance. He senses the times are changing and wants a front-row seat. Also quite fine is Liev Schreiber as Vilma a transvestite ex-Marine in a blond wig and pink shift who provides security at the suddenly overrun El Monaco where a family drama and the human comedy share a double bill.Lee distills the flavor of this transforming event and hints at how it transformed some who were there. His movie is a contact high.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 27 2009 352PM EDT Last updated Tuesday Sep. 01 2009 257AM EDT Comments AA Taking Woodstock Directed by Ang Lee Written by James Schamus Starring Demetri Martin Liev Schreiver Emile Hirsch Classification 14A At the time 40 years ago a mere half-million or so actually attended the concert. Since then of course everybodys been to Woodstock. Enshrined by the Michael Wadleigh documentary and cemented into our cultural lore its become one of those inflated icons a puffed-up symbol for all seasons and reasons refracted through the changing sensibilities not only of baby-boomers but of every subsequent Generation X Y and Z. The music lives on yet so does all that attendant baggage. Thus over the decades Woodstocks meaning has grown as muddy as the event itself. By now to deconstruct such a symbol to hose off the sentimental ooze to find a core of hard truth is no small feat. And Taking Woodstock isnt remotely up to the task. Thats a bit of a surprise since director Ang Lee has a track record of neatly excavating the social strata most pertinently in The Ice Storm  a film that among its other achievements examined the dark legacy of the sexual revolution. Here hes working again with writer James Schamus his long-time collaborator. But the script has a dubious source taken from a memoir by Elliot Tiber that based on this evidence does nothing to scrape the rust off Woodstocks mythic cliche. Instead starting from the split-screen gimmickry of the opening shot the cliches just get recycled. Elliot (Demetri Martin) is the son of squabbling Jewish immigrants who run a flea-bag motel in the sleepy town of Bethel N.Y. Part aspiring painter part wannabe entrepreneur hes a young gay man half out of the closet and the designated peacemaker in his parents antagonistic marriage. As fate would have it Elliot also heads the local chamber of commerce a post that puts him in charge of issuing permits for festive gatherings. A phone call later promoter Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff) shows up with his mane of pre-Raphaelite hair and his entourage of pinstriped lawyers. Negotiations begin; history prepares to be made. Not that we see or hear much of that history. The movie is too busy amassing more stereotypes fictional and otherwise. Like Billy the wigged-out Vietnam vet (Emile Hirsch) smoking his weed and suffering his flashbacks. Or like Max Yasgur himself (Eugene Levy) the neighbouring dairy farmer with 600 acres to rent for a price. With her sturdy muscles and soft heart theres also Vilma the cross-dressing behemoth (Liev Schreiber) who might have just stepped off the pages of The World According to Garp . And dont forget the hippie-dippy theatre troupe ensconced in a barn behind the motel an earnest group of players dividing their time between putting on artsy airs and taking off their tie-dyed clothes. Meanwhile the Woodstock crew descends installing phone lines and building the stage and salting the land with scads of cash. The townsfolk soon take a shine to the arrivistes distrusting their manner but thoroughly enjoying that lucre. However all of this remains peripheral to the main story which persists in revolving around Elliot and his tepidly comic adventures - his homosexual emergence his rapprochement with Daddy his acid trip in a VW van his slipping down the very mud slide so peace-and-lovingly depicted in the Wadleigh doc. But the problem screams out Elliot (through no fault of Martins performance) just isnt that interesting. The guy is what he seems to be a minor figure in a major happening and the screenplay fails to elevate his status to give us a reason to care. Consequently we feel trapped inside his narrow perspective - like him seeing that famous stage only as a white light glimpsed from a distant hill; like him hearing that iconic music only in faint snatches echoing from afar. Yes a limited perspective can be a useful device when wedded to a strong point of view. But the film lacks both strength and point choosing to straddle every fence including the one that continues to divide Woodstock Was it the apotheosis of the Aquarian Age or simply capitalisms group-grope with the counterculture? Or is that a false divide - were the two always inseparable? Taking Woodstock isnt taking sides and ultimately even Lee appears to lose interest flashing none of his usual visual panache and at the end content to forego any considered conclusion for a hunk of lumpy irony. Still the movie does put the lie to one cliche. Turns out hindsight isnt 20/20 - sometimes its just more myopia in rose-tinted glasses.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + All summer weve been subjected to big thinking about the 40th anniversary of Woodstock - personal essays florid reminiscences and roving explorations that ask ""What Did It All Mean? Until we get the inevitable HBO miniseries (Laura Linney as Grace Slick?) we have Ang Lees ""Taking Woodstock or what Ive come to think of as ""The Muppets Take Yasgurs Farm.Lee has gone for shaggy comedy. Some of it is funny. Some of it just sits there. Nothing so specific as sex happens just a lot of writhing fumbling and waking up beside a stranger the next morning. Theres an acid trip in a VW bus that you could probably air on Nickelodeon.So the drugs are cute. The mudslides are cute. The naked boys and girls are cute. Even the kid whos just come home from Vietnam woozy with chemically enhanced post-traumatic stress (Emile Hirsch) has cheeks that are dying for a pinch. When we finally see the concert its from a mile away and it undulates like a Day-Glo volcano. This is as safe and sweet a movie as you could make about Americas sex-drugs-and-rock n roll-est event.Lee and his longtime screenwriter and producer James Schamus arent interested in the concert so much as the impressions the era left. Their distanced approach has its backhanded merits. For one thing it feels subversive. Instead of pious commemoration or epic worship we get an episode of ""That (Almost) 70s Show.The movie focuses on how young Elliot Teichberg (Demetri Martin) haphazardly managed to bring a homeless music festival to his Catskills hamlet and how the arrival of thousands of hippies saved the shoddy motel run by his parents stodgy Holocaust survivors from Russia played by Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman two Brits. Elliot has been living in Manhattan and this is to be the summer he emancipates himself from the expectation that hell run the motel. He wants to move to San Francisco and live as the gay man his parents dont officially know he is.The story is based on a memoir the son wrote under the name Elliot Tiber. (Someone made the unfortunate choice to keep the books punning title.) Schamus distills to a casual phone call the material on Tibers involvement in the Stonewall riots the previous month. Instead he lays out the Teichbergs financial stress (the bank is ready to foreclose on the motel) the drolly staged town council meetings and the negotiations among a bunch of hippies their lawyers and a progressive farmer named Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy) who provided the land for the concert.The Teichbergs motel is ground zero for the festival organizers their friends and whoever else stops by. And the best scenes in the movie arise from the initial comic clash and eventual harmony between Elliots parents and the kids who turn their fleabag into a zoo. Quiet Mr. Teichberg runs the bar forming a friendship with the strapping transvestite (Liev Schreiber) who offers his security services. His wife stomps around the property poking the bushes where kids fool around turns one room into three charging full price bellowing braying and berating the whole time.Where Goodman is warm and reserved Staunton is unhinged. Hers is a performance of broad shameless strokes. If this truly is a Muppet Movie Staunton is every member of Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem. By the time she wakes atop a pile of cash the movie and the actor have crossed over into Jewish grotesque. You dont need Janis Joplin when you have this.Staunton at least is a vibrant alternative to the comparatively somnambulant younger people around her. Martin is a clever comedian with a show on Comedy Central in which he plays instruments and thinks about words. Hes Max Fisher from ""Rushmore as a grad student troubadour. Putting his uptight drollery at the center of a movie is admirable but neither the camera nor the circumstances bring much out of him. A lot of this is in Schamuss writing. Elliot is not a character so much as a window looking onto yesteryear.Indeed hes a lot like the characters played by Tobey Maguire in Lees ""The Ice Storm and ""Ride With the Devil - boys trying to figure out who and what to be during major American upheavals (Watergate and the Civil War respectively). In ""Taking Woodstock the filmmaker seems better able to relate to the grown-ups - the Teichbergs and Yasgur - since they already know who they are.Elliot at least is in the process of finding himself heading to 1969 San Francisco. Id rather see a more serious movie about what happens when he gets there.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/ae/movienation.

Share Tweet In one of the most famous images from Woodstock Michael Wadleighs invaluable 1970 documentary about the 1969 music festival turned generation-defining gathering a pair of nuns make the peace sign for the camera apparently swept up in the spirit of the moment. Ang Lees Taking Woodstock recreates the image while pulling back the curtain watching as a camera crew coaxes the reluctant nuns into flashing the sign ""for fun."" The moment falls in the middle of one of Taking Woodstocks best scenes a long tracking shot that follows star Demetri Martin as he treks down a crowded road toward the festival passing everything from familiar images of flower children to pasted-over 60s dead ends like a placard reading ""Maoism = life"" along the way. The sequence digs beneath the usual peace-and-love cliches but the film around it isnt always so probing. Martin plays Elliot Tiber a native of upstate New York who plays an instrumental role in bringing the festival to Bethel New York when the original location pulls the plug. Originally volunteering the small motel owned by his financially struggling Russian-Jewish emigre parents (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton) Martin later helps coordinate the festival in the face of local opposition all while seemingly ignoring what its message of peace and freedom means to his own situation An artist and veteran of the Stonewall riots hes eager to find a life removed from the sleepy Catskills. Lee and screenwriter James Schamus let Martins journey to liberation play out at an amiable pace synced to Martins reserved performance. While everyone else starts turning on he fights to keep much of his life hidden. Unfortunately the film makes the contrast between Martins understatement and the characters around him a little too stark. Liev Schreiber makes a memorable appearance as a cross-dressing Korean War vet and Jonathan Groff plays Woodstock mastermind Michael Lang as a disarming mix of shaman and con man but stock characters like Emile Hirschs flipped-out Vietnam vet and a frequently nude hippie theater troupe crowd the margins. Even the usually reliable Staunton doesnt know when to rein it in and the film slows to a trudge once it gets to the festival and abandons the tension between profits and counterculture ideals in a swirl of nostalgia. Lees movie is pleasant enough but its too swept up in the spirit its celebrating to ask the relevant questions at least until a final scene that captures the singularity of the Woodstock moment. Looking across waste-strewn fields characters try to process whats happened. We know already what they cant It wont happen again.

"Ang Lees slight and gentle-spirited Taking Woodstock. Slate Sign In Sign Up Ang Lees slight and gentle-spirited Taking Woodstock. Ang Lees slight and gentle-spirited Taking Woodstock. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 27 2009 101 PM The Dud in the Mud Ang Lees slight and gentle-spirited Taking Woodstock. By Dana Stevens Jonathan Groff and Demetri Martin in Taking Woodstock Ang Lees Taking Woodstock (Focus Features) is a mild-mannered coming-of-age piece that feels like a young directors debut film not something wed expect from the man whos already given us The Ice Storm Brokeback Mountain and the (I thought) underrated spy romance Lust Caution. If Taking Woodstock were Lees first effort thered be reason to get excited about the directors nascent career. The movie has its share of quiet pleasures including a funny and tender lead performance from Demetri Martin the standup comic and former Daily Show""youth correspondent"" whos previously struck me as something of a null quantity. But even as a mind-clearing break from Lees darker more ambitious work Taking Woodstock is an underachieving movie so slight and gentle-spirited that it seems to be looking at the summer of 1969 through a scrim of rosy gauze. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Martin is Elliot Teichberg the son of an elderly Jewish couple (played by two British actors Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton) who run the El Monaco a shabby Catskills motel thats facing foreclosure. (The real Teichberg under the pen name Elliot Tiber wrote a book chronicling his role in the staging of the 1969 music festival.) Elliot is longing to break free from his parents orbit--hes just returned from an unsuccessful attempt to make it as a painter and designer in New York City--but as a dutiful son he feels compelled to sort out their financial problems first. When he hears that a neighboring town has refused some concert organizers a permit to perform there Elliot convinces a nearby dairy farmer Max Yasgur (the ever-endearing Eugene Levy) to host the show on his land. In exchange for Elliots help one of the chief concert promoters an unsettlingly mellow hippie played by Jonathan Groff promises him that the El Monaco will become the center of operations for Woodstock management. Advertisement Though the resulting chaos--helicopters full of music executives landing on the lawn counterculture kooks hanging from the rafters--turns their lives upside down the rapid influx of cash solves the Teichbergs financial woes in a hurry. And the tightly wound Elliot surprises himself by hiring a burly drag queen (Liev Schreiber) as a security guard and openly flirting with a hunky construction worker. Taking Woodstock scripted by Lees longtime collaborator James Schamus takes meticulous care to establish a cast of characters and a sense of place then throws away nearly every opportunity to do something with them. Lee who staged mainstream cinemas most famous (and hottest) man-on-man kiss in Brokeback Mountain chooses to frame Elliots first gay kiss from an angle that obscures both participants faces muting what could have been the films most liberatory moment. Elliots discovery of his own gayness and his fathers eventual acceptance of same are elided too quickly especially given how momentous both would have been in 1969. And Imelda Staunton so unforgettable as the stolidly fearless abortionist in Mike Leighs Vera Drake gives a one-note performance in the one-note role of Elliots pathologically tightfisted mother. After the long middle section building up to the actual Woodstock the movies treatment of the event is maddeningly indirect. No ones asking for a song-by-song re-enactment of the concert but Lees refusal to focus even for a moment on the musical aspect of the festival starts to feel almost perverse as if hes deliberately frustrating the audiences desire. By moments youll hear Janis Joplins voice or Jerry Garcias guitar drifting faintly over the cow pastures but Elliots experience of the festival though transformative takes place at a considerable remove from the events onstage.  Late in the movie Elliot does venture near the concert grounds where he spends a day tripping on acid in the DayGlo-painted VW bus of a beatific hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner). On-screen LSD trips havent progressed much since the Roger Corman days (except that digital animation effects have replaced the kaleidoscope imagery). While Im glad for Elliot Teichberg that his mind and ass were freed by experiencing the Woodstock concert at a vague remove I cant say Taking Woodstock did the same for me.

Comments click to enlarge Taking Woodstock 2009 Ang Lees 11th collaboration with producer James Schamus starts out strong and funny before getting mired in 60s nostalgia. Demetri Martin stars as the dutiful son of Jewish immigrants Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman; in the summer of 1969 the couple stand to lose their motel in the Catskills but the son comes to the rescue by leasing it to the producers of the Woodstock festival. The screenplay is sharp and insightful the period details ring true and Martin is appealing as a dreamer conflicted about his homosexuality. But once the action shifts from the town to the festival any momentum gets lost in a psychedelic haze. With Liev Schreiber and Eugene Levy. R 120 min.

Hes among the last directors Id have thought would want to make a movie about the 1969 Woodstock festival which was at least in the popular imagination all yielding and no holding. But its easy to see why Elliot Tibers memoir Taking Woodstock (written with Tom Monte) caught his fancy. Its voice is temperate its true subject the impact of the festival on a closeted young gay man whos finally emboldened to let it all hang out. Tiber ne Teichberg was heir to his parents seedy debt-ridden Catskills motel and when the proposed Woodstock festival was expelled from several New York towns whose elders feared a glut of filthy nasty hippies he saw an opportunity. Tiber had a permit for a very modest music festival of his own in White Lake near Bethel and he found the Woodstock planners a spot at Max Yasgurs nearby farm. His parents motel became a hub; the money poured in; and in spite of the locals anti-Semitic threats by the time Joni Mitchell got to Woodstock the kids were stardust golden and half a million strong. Lee and his producer and screenwriter James Schamus have turned Tibers book into a gentle rather tepid film. Its first half is modest and likable but it goes on for over two hours and even with some gay smooching and a lengthy acid trip it stays cool and cerebral; it doesnt build. You dont expect counterculture fervor from Lee but the setting cries out for some raffishness and hustle with maybe a touch of Robert Altmans ensemble ringmastery. Most of the emotional weight in Taking Woodstock is on transactions -- like the one between Yasgur (Eugene Levy) and Jonathan Groff (as organizer Michael Lang in a vest with no shirt looking like a scrubbed hippie Adonis from a stock company production of Godspell). Its a nice moment when Yasgur tells Lang he expects the organizers to clean up after themselves -- but that joke has no payoff. You dont see Yasgur surveying the endless mud and shit. Youre not even told that the organizers did clean up. Part (but by no means all) of the problem is Demetri Martin who plays Tiber. On his Comedy Central show Martin is a deadpan genius dropping one-liners that seem to come from the dark side of the moon -- yet light up our world making it strange and new. But the part taps nothing except his bland ingenuousness and he ends up a dull bystander. In his memoir Tiber doesnt have a sparkling personality either but early chapters detail the pain and fear of being in the closet -- and reveal that he was actually at the Stonewall gay bar in Greenwich Village the night of the infamous police raid. Imagine throwing rocks at police at Stonewall and then grooving at Woodstock. Youll have to imagine Theres no hint of that side of Tiber onscreen. The other actors make little impact -- even Emile Hirsch as a traumatized Vietnam vet and Liev Schreiber as a giant transvestite named Vilma who becomes the motels director of security. Schreiber goes against the grain and eschews camp playing it straight and matter-of-fact letting his deep voice and outlandish attire carry the comedy. I liked him well enough but the movie needs more loopiness more risk-taking. Well there is one vivid performance the British actress Imelda Staunton fresh from her turn as Harry Potters most sadistic instructor as Tibers monstrous penny-pinching Jewish hysteric of a mother. When this raving Yiddish gnome is onscreen you dont know where to look. Staunton is amazing ... and ghastly Her shrill stylized turn is in a different key than everyone elses mild naturalism. And Lee and Schamus make a huge mistake They have Tiber learning a big Arthur Miller-ish secret about his mother that becomes the films real climax and helps to trigger his leave-taking. But in Tibers book that secret is in the epilogue presented as a sad ironic twist. Making it a Big Moment takes some of the thunder from Woodstock itself. Not that theres too much thunder anyway. The trippy scenes are studied as if the director were an android reproducing transcendence without experiencing it. The most evocative moment in the film is from a distance when Tiber hears the first stirrings of the concert through the trees The sound design is perfect -- echo-y ghostly yet tantalizing. Too bad the filmmakers are true to the historical facts and Tiber is too busy at the motel and never actually gets to that concert. Sure its unlikely the filmmakers could afford half a million extras (or even a thousand) but the sheer scale of Woodstock is central to its role in history and seeing nothing is a real bummer man.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Bright idea having the indisputably great director Ang Lee take us back to the garden to find the grit grace and innocence that marked the Woodstock Music Festival in Bethel New York 40 years ago this month. Not so bright having the script by the estimable James Schamus focus on the sexual coming-out of Elliot Tiber (Comedy Centrals Demetri Martin) whose failing family motel in the Catskills played a part in bringing the festival to fruition. How big a part? Festival producer Michael Lang portrayed with crafty angelic fervor by the gifted stage actor Jonathan Groff (Spring Awakening Hair) claims theres exaggeration notably in Tibers connection to Max Yasgur (the always-welcome Eugene Levy) whose 600-acre dairy farm became the concert site. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> For me fact-fudging isnt the problem. What matters is that Tiber a closeted interior designer afraid to come out to his immigrant parents (Jewish stereotypes in the usually capable hands of Brit actors Imelda Staunton and Henry Goodman) seems like the least compelling person around. I kept wanting to follow Liev Schreiber as a cross-dressing ex-Marine or Emile Hirsch as an agitated Vietnam vet. Its no strain to see what Lee is aiming for and only fitfully achieves a sweet comedy of transformation in which the changes in Elliot mirror a cultural revolution. But all the tie-dye reefer skinny-dipping split-screen cinematography (from Eric Gautier) and acid-trip psychedelics courtesy of Tibers encounter with hippies (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) cant make up for the films major sin of omission the music. Whether the filmmakers were limited by rights issues or simply chose to not use concert footage Janis Joplin Jimi Hendrix Jefferson Airplane the Who the Band the Grateful Dead name your rock legend remain frustratingly out of reach. Tiber never made it near the festival stage with an audience of half a million strong. After seeing Taking Woodstock I know how he feels.

Lets just hope the overrated Oscar-winning director doesnt make the sequel about the Altamont festival he hints at to anyone whos still awake at the end of this two-hour snooze which provides not even a mild buzz. Jimi Janis Arlo and the rest are far far far away as Lee and his studio-chief scenarist James Schamus perversely choose to view the proceedings from the very distant vantage point of a young man who -- at least according to this movie -- tangentially enabled the festival to proceed. Elliot Tiber upon whose memoirs the film is based was a Manhattan interior decorator who spent his weekends trying to help his stereotypically Jewish parents from losing their fading motel in Bethel NY. He was also head of Bethels Chamber of Commerce and issued himself a permit for a small music festival. When Elliot reads that a large festival with big names has been forced out of nearby Wallkill by local opposition -- Woodstock had wanted no part of its namesake event -- he sees an opportunity to fill up his parents motel with festival staff. How exciting. There are two main problems with ""Taking Woodstock."" One is the central nonperformance by the stand-up comedian Demetri Martin who is pretty much an emotional black hole as Elliot. By all accounts Tiber is a flamboyant personality in real life but as awkwardly played by Martin hes pretty much personality-free. Perhaps surprisingly from the director of ""Brokeback Mountain"" the movie doesnt make much of an issue of the characters gayness -- which is utterly untrue to the period 1969 even in enlightened circles. Our passive hero doesnt encounter much in the way of dramatic conflict. Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy in the movies best performance) whose farm hosts the festival quickly faces down the objections of the Bethel locals. Maxs dad -- played by British actor Henry Goodman best known here for being fired as Nathan Lanes replacement in ""The Producers"" on Broadway -- runs off some local gangsters who want a piece of the action. Which leaves Elliot to moon over one of the festival organizers his frequently bare-chested former classmate Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff). The closest Elliot gets to the festival is a hill overlooking the very distant stage where he takes acid with a couple in a van (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) -- a hilariously bad sequence. Liev Schreiber who visited Woodstock a decade ago in ""A Walk on the Moon"" is back as a transsexual security guard; Meryl Streeps daughter Mamie Gummer has little to do but look great in period clothes as Langs putative girlfriend; and Emile Hirsch pops up here and there as the standard-issue traumatized Vietnam vet. Imelda Staunton as Elliots fearsome control-freak mother appears to have dropped in from another movie altogether. Theres some mud drugs nudity and a lot of fringe and beads -- but no performance footage to speak of in ""Taking Woodstock."" Do yourself a favor and watch Michael Wadleighs 1970 concert film instead.

The film mostly stays away from the festivals electric center of gravity. A lot of it is set in a run-down motel in the Catskills town of White Lake N.Y. where hippie drifters start to show up and clog the roads. Lee captures the fractious joyful monstrously evolving mass it all was. The festival could have made for a lively ? Altmanesque canvas of the counterculture. ? Instead Lee sets his sights on Elliot Tiber ? (Demetri Martin) a shy interior designer whose cranky Yiddishe parents own the motel in ? question. Elliot inadvertently gets Woodstock launched by leading a trivial Chamber of ?Commerce vote and its fun to see him rub shoulders with Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy) who rents his acreage out to the festival and with Michael Lang the bare-chested-under-his-vest hippie capitalist who masterminds the event; Jonathan Groff plays Lang as a cagey idealist who uses his ""Oh wow"" enthusiasm to size up every situation. But mostly were watching Elliot who is gay and scared learn to give in to his feelings and defy his parents.

"taking woodstock movie review movie review taking woodstock ang lee Liev Schreiber Imelda Staunton Eugene Levy - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Taking Woodstock -- 4 out of 5 stars Demetri Martin Focus Features Focus Features Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic This is the way we should remember Woodstock -- a sea of people a river of mud a mountain of garbage and a whole lotta love.And that sound echoing from off in the acid-warped distance? Its the music man. Ang Lees Taking Woodstock is a coming-of-age comedy that roams the backstage and the back-story and sees that epic concert through rose-colored glasses. Its got every 60s cause -- from bra burning to draft-card burning environmentalism to gay liberation -- and every 60s movie cliche the Nam vet having flashbacks stoned hippies hippie-hating cops parents learning the joys of hash brownies.Theres nothing like cliches for a warm wallow in nostalgia. The director of Brokeback Mountain adapted Elliot Tibers book recalling the event and shows us the concert experience through young Elliots eyes. Elliot (Demetri Martin) was a young newly-out gay artist just returned from the Stonewall Riot that launched gay liberation struggling to save his parents dump of a motel. But the ""El Monaco International Resort amp; Casino"" with its dirty rooms and tatty cabins was in Bethel New York. And when Woodstock concert promoters lost their planned venue just down the road it was Elliot who thought to call them who talked his neighbor Max Yasgur into renting out his dairy farm all to make a little music and a little history.Taking Woodstock is a movie of characters and context. It was the summer of Apollo 11. Bethel was a moribund village where Elliot ran a chamber of commerce with no real commerce. The culture was divided along a generation gap. That plays out in Elliots own family where his comically mean and cheap mom (Imelda Staunton a riot) and long-suffering dad (Henry Goodman) resist this ""hippie invasion"" he has brought down on them.Eugene Levy plays Yasgur as a trusting tolerant soul but one who is cagier than he came off in Michael Wadcleighs famed Woodstock documentary. Theres Vilma (Liev Schreiber cool and hilarious in wig and high heels) the transvestite who runs security. Promoter Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff) is an idealized mellow fellow in the prettiest Jewfro in history literally riding in on horseback to chill everybody out. And Dan Fogler of Fanboys heads an avante garde theater troupe that was there before there was a ""Woodstock"" and naked before any of the teeming masses who followed.Even as Woodstock gets the mud and the mess it sugar-coats the drugs and the generational/cultural divide. Lee mixes film stocks and splits the screen just like the famed documentary about the concert (a concert we never see in this film) and gives us a special-effects acid trip. He has so many players and so many interesting characters that its surprising hes able to do a few of them justice. Even the standard-issue burned out veteran ( Emile Hirsch) has a moment of grace. Thats the message of the film too. It was just a moment. But up there on Yasgurs farm for one long weekend it really was about peace and love.|.|. and mud and overflowing toilets. Whatever the smelly wet reality the legend is what endures.

This is Woodstock from another perspective -- one without Jimi Hendrix or Janis Joplin. Perhaps this version is closer in spirit to what Joni Mitchell later sang about (but didnt herself experience) the anticipation while heading up to Max Yasgurs farm in August 1969 the desire to be ""a cog in something turning."" Though director Ang Lee vibrantly captures the era his focus on the mechanics of putting together the Woodstock Music and Arts Festival is juxtaposed with a humdrum coming-of-age tale. Setting this prosaic personal tale amid such a resonant socio-cultural event only intensifies the wan nature of the main story. If anyone can fashion a great movie its the monumentally talented Lee. He has said that after making so many tragic films --TheIce Storm Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Brokeback Mountain --he sought to direct a comedy that lacked cynicism. He has done that but he also has made a surprisingly bland film. There is undoubtedly a great movie in the Woodstock experience. This particular take based on the memoirs of Elliot Tiber isnt it. Without intending to Elliot (Demetri Martin) becomes a key player in the making of the festival. An interior designer living in Greenwich Village Elliot goes to the Catskills to help his parents save their run-down motel. He hears city officials in a neighboring town have nixed a permit for a music festival and lobbies to host it as a way to drum up business. When his familys land is unsuitable Yasgurs neighboring dairy farm proves ideal. Elliots family figures prominently particularly his rigid mother (Imelda Staunton). But Martins casting is problematic. Though mildly engaging he doesnt have the acting range or convey the charisma to play the pivotal role. Liev Schrieber has a more intriguing role as a cross-dressing ex-Marine as does Emile Hirsch as a jangled Vietnam vet. Partly because of competition from other films Taking Woodstocks release was delayed to follow the festivals anniversary Aug. 16. But regardless of when it arrives Lees movie captures the mellow mood and mud-caked faces of the crowd but misses the reverberations of the counterculture revolution that brought the great unwashed to that farm.

Rating R for graphic nudity some sexual content drug use and language. Related Taking Woodstock embodying 69 in the hair amp; now Ang Lee takes Woodstock Woodstock Peace mud amp; music Woodstock Pivotal performances 5 best rock films It seems somehow appropriate to suggest that you wont remember Ang Lees ""Taking Woodstock"" even if youre there in the theater watching it. Though depending on what you do before the movie for vastly different reasons. Lee is a great director with such films as ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" to his credit. But ""Woodstock"" while perfectly well-made (with one glaring exception) and entertaining enough isnt particularly memorable certainly not in the way Lees best work is. The movie is more of a family drama with the most famous concert ever staged serving as a backdrop (though given its size and importance it naturally moves to the forefront on occasion as well). But the drama isnt nearly as compelling as the festival itself. Elliot Teichberg (Demetri Martin) is spending the summer of 1969 trying to keep his parents low-rent motel afloat. His mother Sonia (Imelda Staunton) is the smothering Jewish-mother type stereotypically so while his father Jake (Henry Goodman) suffers silently. Elliot has managed to get himself elected as the youngest-ever president of the Bethel N.Y. Chamber of Commerce. When a neighboring town turns away the Woodstock Music amp; Art Fair he thinks getting a permit might be a nice little boost for the motel and the town. The rest as they say is history. But here its history told on a more personal level through the eyes of Elliot. He longs for more from life but hes essentially trapped by his parents though one might think that spending more than five minutes with Sonia would send even the most devoted son fleeing in terror (and may nearly cause the audience to do the same; Stauntons performance is way over the top). Relief comes in the form of the hundreds of thousands of people who traipse past his parents motel during the festival - organizer Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff looking and acting exactly like the laid-back genuine item) and the crew setting up the show rent out all the rooms and then some. And Elliot meets some interesting people especially Vilma (Liev Schreiber) a cross-dressing former Marine who appoints himself head of security around the motel. To the closeted Elliot Vilmas a breath of fresh air. He turns out to be the same thing for Jake and serves as a kind of go-between for father and son. Meanwhile theres a concert going on. Elliot wanders down to Max Yasgurs farm (Eugene Levy plays Yasgur as a bemused sort who gets whats going on though perhaps not the scope). Along the way Elliot winds up in a van with a couple of hippies who wandered over from central casting (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner) where he takes his first acid trip. Unfortunately Lee takes us right along with him resulting in a silly sequence that looks like an outtake from an ""ABC Afterschool Special."" In the one true misstep in the film Elliot tunes in turns on and gathers the strength and courage to break free of his mother all in somewhat unconvincing fashion. Martin is serviceable as Elliot; that description works for most of the principals with the exception of Schreiber whos outstanding. Lee offers occasional nods to Michael Wadleighs 1970 documentary ""Woodstock"" with split screens and such but it is Woodstock light which is one thing. It is also Ang Lee light which is another thing altogether and far less satisfying. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

"Taking Woodstock | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; taking-woodstock ) Taking Woodstock (United States 2009) August 25 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Woodstock - the shining moment in the age of peace and free love the incredible high that came before the bad trip of the 70s - is often remembered most for the music. This is due in no small part to Michael Wadleighs definitive documentary. For Taking Woodstock director Ang Lee and his longtime collaborator screenwriter James Schamus (both working from the book by Elliot Tiber) looked at things through a differently colored lens. Yes Woodstock was a music festival but the reality is that only a fraction of the half-million there got close enough to experience the music. The concert element was only one aspect of a huge gathering - a time for people of like minds to come together drop acid have sex and run naked through the rain and mud. This is the element of Woodstock that Lee and Schamus concentrate upon. Unfortunately they do so in a project that is rather shapeless with a protagonist who is less than compelling. Taking Woodstock focuses on the efforts of Elliot Teichberg (Demetri Martin) who is based on the real-life Elliot Tiber to bring Woodstock to the farm of Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy). What is initially for him a business proposition to keep the rundown motel of his immigrant parents Sonia (Imelda Staunton) and Jake (Henry Goodman) from going under turns into a life-altering experience. The film follows events from before the decision is made to give the concert a home in Yasgurs fields to the massive clean-up that took place in the days after the event was concluded. The least interesting part of the film relates to Elliot and his transformation. This problem has two causes Demetri Martin is so laid-back as an actor and radiates so little screen presence that he is inevitably eclipsed by anyone else appearing in a scene with him regardless of who the ""anyone"" is. Secondly Elliots character arc is clichA(c)d and uninteresting especially happening as it does in the shadow of one of the great cultural events of the 1960s. Elliot especially as portrayed by Martin is not capable of holding a viewers attention. Its possible he was patterned after Ben Braddock from The Graduate but the charisma and humanity brought to that part by Hoffman are absent here. Likewise one could argue that theres a little of Almost Famous protagonist to be found in Elliot but here too theres a personality gap. The movie hits its stride when it deals directly with the concert. The more peripheral Elliot is to the story the better things become. Taking Woodstock expends a fair amount of screen time on the logistics and the obstacles that had to be overcome to get things ready - permits resistance from the locals financial negotiations press conferences mob involvement and how to deal with the vast influx of hippies. When it comes to August 15-18 the event is depicted from the perspective of those who didnt get close enough to discern the music as anything more than a distant roar. Im not sure Elliot ever hears a single song - hes too busy dropping acid and engaging in a threesome with a couple of ""friends"" (Paul Dano Kelli Garner) or playing in the mud with a war-scarred buddy (Emile Hirsch). Those expecting a soundtrack rich with 60s rock and folk music will find their glass more than half-empty. The song choices often have more to do with the mood of a particular scene than a connection with Woodstock. One example Blind Faiths ""Cant Find My Way Home"" is used effectively as Elliot is surveying the field after everyone except the cleaners have left - but although its period accurate (having been released in 1969) neither Blind Faith nor Steve Winwood appeared at Woodstock. None of the famous ""anthems"" of the concert are featured in the movie in large part because Lee did not want to compete with the documentary. Still while one can understand his reasons the lack of at least a sampling of the music makes Taking Woodstock feel incomplete. The best performances are in the supporting ranks. Eugene Levy is credible in the straight role of Yasgur. Liev Schreiber stands out as the cross-dressing ex-Marine Vilma who provides security for Elliot and his family. Hirsch Dano and Garner are all good although none have more than cameo-length appearances. Staunton and Goodman are both solid but their performances go in service of underwritten parts. Taking Woodstock is mainly for viewers who want to understand a little bit more about the concert from a behind-the-scenes perspective. It would be a solid special feature to a deluxe edition box set of Wadleighs film. As a stand-alone Taking Woodstock tries to do too much with too little and as a result is untethered. Since the least compelling aspects of the movie are the fictionalized ones I suspect I would have appreciated a straightforward documentary covering the same territory. Since one doesnt exist (Wadleighs having a different focus) and Lee puts a lot of effort into making an impressive re-creation of the event I find myself more kindly disposed toward the movie as a whole than toward Elliots somewhat tedious narrative thread.

Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A semi-closeted young man lands at the center of the 1969 Woodstock Music amp; Art Fair. BOTTOM LINE An uneven blend of cliched comedy family drama and boomer nostalgia. CAST Demetri Martin Liev Schreiber Emile Hirsch Jonathan Groff LENGTH 201 I think theres gonna be another riot"" a male caller tells young Elliot Tiber in ""Taking Woodstock."" Its an early hint that Tiber played with great sensitivity by comedian Demetri Martin is openly gay when visiting New York City but not here in his parents dumpy Catskills motel. And as he recalls the violent liberating protests at the Manhattan gay bar Stonewall Inn in June 1969 he smiles. But smiling or stifling a smile is nearly all this emotionally paralyzed character does in ""Taking Woodstock"" Ang Lees adaptation of Tibers memoir. Tiber ne Teichberg helped bring the Woodstock Music amp; Art Fair to tiny Bethel N.Y. whose residents rewarded him with anti-hippie anti-Jewish wrath - a story potentially full of color chaos and transformation. But the movie is frustratingly sedate more opiate than hallucinogen. advertisement | advertise on newsday Lee and producer-screenwriter James Schamus (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") aim for comedy but come up with cliches the wigged-out Vietnam vet (Emile Hirsch) the gun-toting drag queen (Liev Schreiber) the genial stoner in the VW bus (Paul Dano). Tibers grasping screeching mother (Imelda Staunton) actually borders on an ugly stereotype. Only the shrewd farm owner Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy) seems like a real person. Tibers book mentions several gay experiences some empowering some brutalizing but here theyre reduced to two a brief hookup and an ambiguous hug-fest. Its a strangely timid approach from the director of ""Brokeback Mountain."" Given the low social status of gays in the 1960s a time when other minorities were not only championed but positively idealized by the hippies ""Taking Woodstock"" could have shed light on a larger story. Instead the movie stays small and like its protagonist fearfully constricted. Forget peace and love you want to tell Tiber. Go start that riot.

"Review Ang Lee takes Woodstock lightly - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Ang Lee takes Woodstock lightlyBy Charlie McCollumMercury NewsPosted 08/24/2009 072949 PM PDTUpdated 08/26/2009 022547 PM PDTClick photo to enlarge In this film publicity image released by Focus Features Mamie Gummer left Jonathan Groff center and Demetri Martin are shown in a scene from ""Taking Woodstock."" (AP Photo/Focus Features Ken Regan)  NO SALES  <<123>>THERE ARE SOME truly sweet funny and heartfelt moments in director Ang Lees ""Taking Woodstock."" Too bad they are scattered throughout a film that lacks focus structure and any sense of just how transformative the weekend music festival was for a generation.Lees movie is clearly meant to be a celebration of the Woodstock nation ethos. There isnt an ounce of cynicism in it and the dark side of this gathering of the tribes is largely glossed over.James Schamus screenplay is based -- rather loosely -- on a book by Elliot Tiber a failed interior designer who in the summer of 1969 retreated to upstate New York to help his Jewish immigrant family save its rundown motel the El Monaco. One of his ideas a music and arts festival at the motel (he thinks a string quartet would be nice). So Tiber (called Elliot Teichberg and played by standup comedian Demetri Martin in the film) gets the necessary permit. Movie showtimes Final Destination Death Trip 3D"" Halloween II It Might Get Loud Play the Game Somers Town Taking Woodstock Worlds Greatest Dad Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Shortly afterward the Woodstock festival is booted from a nearby town when townspeople object to what they assume will be an onslaught of hippies. Seeing an opportunity Tiber calls Woodstock promoter Michael Lang out of the blue and offers his permit and the motel grounds for the event. The El Monaco isnt the right spot for the concert but a nearby dairy farm owned by Max Yasgur is.Soon the town of Bethel and the El Monaco are filled with colorful characters (a few too many of which border on stereotypes) and Elliot a closeted gay man searching for his sexual and cultural identity finds himself caught up in a hurricane of change. Advertisement The central problem with ""Taking Woodstock"" is the character of Elliot. As written by Schamus and portrayed by Martin making his film debut Elliot is a bit of cipher who never commands our interest when he should be the films protagonist. (In real life Elliot Tiber becomes a leading gay activist.) Too often he simply fades into the background as events swirl around him and in what should be his transformative moment there is no real sense of joy or enlightenment.Then there is the issue of how few characters go beyond stereotype. Embittered Vietnam vet? Check -- even though Emile Hirsch tries to bring some nuance to the role. Hippie guerrilla theater? Check. Acid heads grooving in a minivan? Check. The characters are all representative of the period but they come off as one-dimensional more symbols than individuals.When the film does work it is often because of the performances rather than the script. Liev Schrieber plays the one truly original character an ex-Marine turned drag queen called Vilma and he makes the most of it. Schrieber turns Vilma into the movies most vibrant character whether counseling Elliot on finding himself or chasing off thugs who try to shake down Elliots parents for protection money. (Hes also quite fetching in a blond wig and dress.)Then theres Jonathan Groff a stage actor (""Spring Awakening"" the latest revival of ""Hair"") doing his first film turn. As Lang he commands every one of his scenes and conveys some of the producers hubris and arrogance. Eugene Levy is a hoot as Yasgur (his negotiations with Lang for the use of the farm is one of the films best scenes) and British actor Henry Goodman is quietly effective as Elliots father Jake.If there is a surprise in the cast -- and not a good surprise -- it is the normally very reliable Imelda= Staunton. She is funny at times as Elliots money-grubbing mother Sonia but too often she overacts chewing every piece of scenery in sight.Lee does an admirable job with the look of the picture (shot in a way to suggest Michael Wadleighs seminal 1970 documentary ""Woodstock"") and with some of the major set pieces such as Elliots ride on a police motorcycle through the massive convoy of vehicles and people headed to the concert site. But then in the films last 20 minutes Lee tosses in an LSD trip that is no more credible than some of the action sequences in his 2003 take on the Incredible Hulk.The acid scene is part of a running gag Elliot never gets to see any of the musicians who came to play the festival. Which brings up another of the films problems a complete disconnect from the music. Oh you get snatches of it -- a hint of Melanie here a snatch of Canned Heat there -- but there seems to have been a conscious but curious decision to downplay the concert itself.Overall theres no question that ""Taking Woodstock"" is a good-hearted attempt to re-create a moment in time that sometime succeeds in its aim.

And if you were can you please stop gassing on about it? Aquarian Nostalgia(tm) is the most oppressively sanctimonious and dull stripe of reminiscing. Sure the three free days of peace and music at Max Yasgurs farm passed without violent incident but almost the second Jimi Hendrix put his guitar down after playing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" the marketplace for boomer sentimental-journeys sprang up. Though the fact that Michael Lang one of the rock shows original four organizers canceled Woodstocks 40th-anniversary concert because of a lack of corporate sponsorship suggests that 60s narcissism may finally be coming to an end Ang Lees facile Taking Woodstock proves that the decade is still prone to the laziest wide-eyed oversimplifications.To its credit Taking Woodstock--based on Elliot Tibers 2007 memoir Taking Woodstock A True Story of a Riot a Concert and a Life and written by Lees frequent collaborator James Schamus--features no actors pantomiming Janis Joplin Ravi Shankar or Sha-Na-Na; in fact little music from the concert itself is heard. On display instead are inane occasionally borderline offensive portrayals of Jews performance artists trannies Vietnam vets squares and freaks.Though his age is never mentioned in the film the real-life Elliot (whose surname is ""Teichberg"" in Lees movie and is played by Demetri Martin) was 34 during the summer of 69. According to his memoir Tiber was present at another sacrosanct revolution two months earlier Stonewall. Elliots gayness becomes Lees tenuous overarching theme awkwardly shoehorned in; Elliot and a butch construction worker he later makes out with meet-cute over a Judy Garland record. But Elliots Uranian tendencies must be kept hidden from his Jewish-emigre parents Jake and Sonia (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton the latter of whom is seen passed out on a pile of cash clutching tens and twenties) who run El Monaco a decrepit motel in upstate Bethel. The good closeted budding-entrepreneur son leaves Manhattan to help them and after reading that neighboring Wallkill says no to hosting a bunch of long hairs grooving out to some hard rock sets the wheels in motion for Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff) and associates to have the concert in his Catskills hamlet.Beyond Elliots marginally interesting homo conflict--hes given a push to come out by Liev Schreibers ridiculous drag queen Vilma who shows up to provide security--Taking Woodstock does nothing more than recycle the same late-60s tropes seen countless times since the Carter administration. The rages and flashbacks of Emile Hirschs fried Vietnam vet are the usual PTSD overacting. The Earthlight Players a performance troupe that lives in the barn next to El Monaco (""Some are Vassar graduates"" Elliot explains) are as dumb a depiction of avant-garde thespians as something that Jesse Helms might have concocted. On his way to the concert uptight Elliot takes acid and sees the truth; back at the motel perpetually miserable Jake and Sonia unknowingly scarf down pot brownies and frolic in the rain; father and son form a deep post-high bond the next day. Eat drink man woman. Making his way through the political booths at Woodstock Elliot sees women burning their bras at the United Feminist Front booth--a practice debunked years ago thus making it all the more irresistible to Schamus and Lee apparently.Near the films end theres an allusion to Altamont the free Rolling Stones concert in December 1969 that would become the anti-Woodstock but no mention of an even bloodier event that had occurred just the week before 500000 kids gathered to hear Richie Havens the Tate-LaBianca murders. Taking Woodstock is a film for those who like childrens stories about tumultuous times--everyone else can pick up Joan Didions The White Album.

By David Denby Leslie and Andrew Cockburns film looks at the social ecology of financial meltdown.   Credit Illustration by John Ritter The movies are still one of the best ways of giving body flavor and emotion to the abstractions and puzzlements of an enormous crisis. In the most fascinating scenes in ""American Casino""--a terrific documentary chronicling the subprime-mortgage mess and the financial collapse of the past two years--a former banker for Bear Stearns sits in the dark his face shadowed and his voice (I believe) slightly altered. We might be watching a retired criminal or spy a man both proud of his dexterity and ashamed of the disaster that it led to. Out of the shadows he explains how such bizarre instruments as collateralized debt obligations (C.D.O.s) quieted the normal skepticism of investors. Heres the drill when the bank assembled a group of mortgage-backed bonds as an investment product it submitted them to a ratings agency. But the agency rather than run its own computer models on the trustworthiness of such bonds he says merely handed the job back to the bank which ran its models. Having received a fee of perhaps a hundred thousand dollars for not doing anything the agency then signed off on the phony ratings. You can read about a scam like that in a newspaper and be surprised but when the perpetrator actually explains it to you your reaction falls somewhere between nausea and hilarity. Its as if the Russian Mafia had paid a Colombian drug cartel to certify its integrity. The banker apparently still a young man grows more chagrined as he digs further into absurdity. The debt obligation thus packaged and affirmed was divided into tranches--bonds rated from an inflated AAA at the top to worthless at the bottom. The bank then took one of the lower sets of tranches consisting say of BBB bonds repackaged them as a new instrument and magically rated perhaps eighty per cent of them AAA. In a final twist some of the lowest tranches from this new instrument were spun into still another product and once again some of the lower tranches were upgraded. This final iteration of the product--based on ratings that had passed through three degrees of fakery--was known in house as a ""C.D.O. squared."" By now the underlying assets were leveraged the Shadow says at a thousand to one maybe even ten thousand to one. ""Who was buying those C.D.O.s squared?"" an interviewer asks. ""Idiots"" comes the reply from the dark. Idiocy is a great subject for comedy but a depressing and rarely instructive one for drama and documentary and yet as everybody in ""American Casino"" keeps telling us we all got caught up in this stuff as homeowners or as taxpayers financing a bailout; even if we didnt initiate it the idiocy enveloped our lives. The movie was put together by the husband-and-wife team of Leslie (director and writer) and Andrew (writer) Cockburn veterans of many documentaries on war and nuclear proliferation. The Cockburns have finally made a movie about a nuclear disaster that actually happened--their subject is the social ecology of financial meltdown. They filmed interviews with bankers business commentators and homeowners battling foreclosure but they go much further than talking heads. They pull together sorrowful footage of stable neighborhoods--both prosperous and working-class--slipping into dereliction with junk-laden yards boarded-up doorways squatters taking control of abandoned houses and charging rent to the homeless. What happened at Bear Stearns or at Goldman Sachs affected the mosquito levels in Riverside County California (the insects breed with special fecundity in abandoned swimming pools). With a rare cohesive power the Cockburns fill in the lines of connection. They function a little like Raymond Chandler as he traces the corruption that produces at the end of a long chain of circumstances the lady in the lake. A genial Baltimore man named Denzel Mitchell a social-studies teacher is interviewed on the day he declared bankruptcy and on this same day we see his house auctioned off (in a dead market there is only one prospective buyer) on the steps of a Baltimore courthouse. Later in the movie the financial reporter Mark Pittman a sleuth sifting through Bloomberg screens finds the C.D.O. issued by Goldman in which Mitchells mortgage has been dumped into a pool of assets. Everything is connected the movie embodies chaos theory for social pessimists. The big picture is held together for us by Michael Greenberger the director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the Clinton Administration. Greenberger a talented explainer charts the development of more and more complicated and preposterous instruments ending with credit-default swaps. As he reaches the climax of his tale--the collapse of the banks and the insurance companies--rage and amusement battle for control of his face. His passionate exposition gives us the strongest emotional release we get from the material. Its a little hard to know what to make of the eloquent sorrows of an African-American therapist in Baltimore who cant meet her mortgage payments and eventually loses her house. The Cockburns dont make it clear whether she was taken in by predatory lenders who (as a variety of people explain) targeted minority groups and falsified income statements in order to grant unqualified people loans or whether she simply miscalculated the amount of money that she had available to make her payments. When the Cockburns turn to victims they absolve them of responsibility for their troubles which seems no better than a partial truth. After a while one looks for straightforward citizenly virtue and one finds it in the people who are left cleaning up the mess the mortgage counsellors in Baltimore who try to help people climb out of trouble; the city official who mournfully boards up houses; the very matter-of-fact guy who controls the mosquito population before the insects spread disease. When the recovery comes all those people will still be there without acclaim helping ruined neighborhoods spring back to life. The movie is a lucid and comprehensive picture of a rotten system but its a relief to know that some people in the midst of disaster were doing their jobs. On August 4 1964 the first day of his employment in Robert S. McNamaras Department of Defense Daniel Ellsberg received cables describing an attack on American ships in the Gulf of Tonkin by North Vietnamese torpedo boats. The American commander in the gulf cast doubt on the report a few hours later and within days it was clear that no such attack had taken place. Yet President Lyndon B. Johnson used the event to persuade Congress to pass the Tonkin Gulf Resolution which was the overt beginning of an American commitment that lasted eleven years. Ellsberg had been a Marine officer in the fifties and then an employee of the Rand Corporation a military think tank; he was a fervent cold warrior. In 1966 eager to see how the war was going he led an infantry company as a civilian in the Northern Mekong Delta. Out on point with several other men he suddenly came under fire from some Vietcong who had been hiding in the water alongside the company and were now behind him. He and his men couldnt fire on the Vietnamese without possibly hitting Americans farther back in the column. As a result of that incident and many other small instances of Vietcong daring he realized that the war couldnt be won and that he had to do something about stopping it. ""The Most Dangerous Man in America Daniel Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers"" (opening September 16th) dramatizes a kind of secular spiritual journey--from warrior to anti-warrior from analyst to activist from patriot to ""traitor."" Ellsberg himself now in his late seventies describes the stages of this transformation with his usual precision and ardor and the filmmakers Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith fill in events with news footage and rather hokey re-creations of Ellsbergs actions (a man in shadow speaking into a telephone etc.). As a young man Ellsberg with Paul Newman blue eyes and a slight touch of mischief beneath the grave exterior was so attractive that he made sobriety seem charismatic. The movie is an act of hero worship but it inadvertently suggests that without a necessary touch of grandiosity Ellsberg might never have acted as bravely as he did. The top-secret Pentagon Papers which he released to the Times in 1971 did not in fact contain current military secrets--the papers were an extended history of Americas involvement in Vietnam revealing that various Administrations had lied to the public about what they were doing. In the movies juiciest moments we hear excerpts from Richard Nixons reaction to Ellsberg (taped in the Oval Office) which display the President at his low-minded and vicious worst. The movie sets the two of them up as opponents and implies that Ellsberg won the contest--that he was the force that caused Nixon to implode in Watergate and the war finally to end. That may be giving Ellsberg more credit than is due but its good to hear that gravelly meticulous voice again explain why he could not absolve himself of responsibility for anything that he had done in his life.

On one hand its a featherlight surprisingly broad comedy which swallows the hippie-dream propaganda whole; on the other its a winningly un-cynical warmly nostalgic tale of simple self-discovery.Gay Jewish and desperately seeking purpose Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin) leaves his liberated NYC existence to help his parents with their crumbling rustic motel upstate. Hearing about a major rock festival seeking a home Elliott offers his small hometown as a venue the motel as mission control and his own services as local liaison.Anyone with an ounce of scepticism about the hippie myth will be infuriated by Taking Woodstock a film so starry-eyed and winsome it would make Joni Mitchell blush. But leave those preconceptions at the door and theres a lot to enjoy here hipster stand-up Martin is agreeably off-kilter in his first feature role backed  by a dizzying array of memorable supporting players notably Imelda Staunton channeling Mel Brooks as Elliots crotchety Nazi-obsessed mother and Brit theatre and TV actor Henry Goodman in a remarkable turn as put-upon dad Jake. But the real star is Lees direction. Goosing Godard with an epic track through traffic loading the screen with whirling naked bodies withholding the epic scale of the festival until Elliot (and the cinematography) are blitzed to the gills on LSD this may be a minor movie but it displays the hallmarks of a major talent.Read an interview with the director here By Tom Huddleston Posted Tuesday November 10 2009 Details Release details Rated 15 Release date Friday November 13 2009 Duration 120 mins Cast and crew Director Ang Lee Screenwriter James Schamus Cast Demetri MartinHenry GoodmanImelda StauntonEmile HirschLiev SchreiberEugene LevyJonathan GroffPaul DanoKelli GarnerJeffrey Dean Morgan Users say (5) 3 out of 5 stars Average User Rating3.8 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star04 star33 star02 star01 star0LiveReviews|51 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshNov 11 2010Kathy Jo in CincinnatiFeaturedMy husband and I watched this on NetFlix last night and we loved it Today I looked at the awful reviews and it only confirmed not to read them.

Partly it is an homage to the original film of the original Woodstock festival on which Martin Scorsese was assistant director. It uses a similar split screen technique to depict simultaneous events and the same event from different angles.

Not that I much mind sitting through four or five interesting failures though that can start to get a tad demoralizing after a while. As Theodore Sturgeon once accurately observed 90% of everything is crap and thats as true at Cannes as it is everywhere else on the planet; Im perfectly happy if just one or two movies knock me on my ass each year and theres still plenty of time for that to happen. No what bothers me is the certain knowledge that back at home everyone whos seeing my barrage of B-s and C+s is writing me off as an irredeemable crank and that itll be months (at least) before they see the films for themselves and--much more frequently than not though Scott Tobias will deny it--concede that I was at least within spitting distance of correct. As it happens three of the five disappointments Ive experienced since my last report fall into a personal blind spot involving movies that merely regurgitate real-life characters and/or events. So instead of my usual in-the-order-seen rundown let me tackle those first with a blanket disclaimer that fans of biopics and historical re-creations may not concur. (1) Lifestyles of the Dead and Famous. Given her bizarre auteurist take on Henry James The Portrait of a Lady--not remotely successful to my mind but certainly distinctive--the most surprising thing about Jane Campions Bright Star which recounts the doomed romance between John Keats and Fanny Brawne is how utterly BBC-conventional it is. Ben Whishaw (Perfume The Story of a Murderer) coughs up a storm as the consumptive Romantic poet; Abbie Cornish (Somersault) alternates between fierce and frail as the tale and 21st-century post-feminism demand and the film as a whole is handsome intelligent and tasteful to a fault with no trace of the neo-Gothic fervor that made The Piano such a singular period drama. (Theres plenty of breathless poetry recitation though if that turns you on.) I confess that I started tuning out as soon as Fanny opened a copy of Endymion and promptly swooned at its opening line. A thing of beauty is a joy forever but a thing of plodding inevitability is just two hours of my time amiably wasted. Grade C+ (2) Death to the Wiki-movie. None of the characters in Ang Lees Taking Woodstock adapted from the memoir by key organizer Elliot Tiber is especially famous but the story of the concert itself passed into legend long ago which means that youre just sitting there waiting for Max Yasgur to show up (hey its Eugene Levy) for the roads into Bethel to be jammed by barefoot hippies for heavy rains to turn Yasgurs field into a giant mud pit and inevitably for Lee to employ the same split-screen effect that Scorsese and Schoonmaker used when editing Michael Wadleighs Woodstock. Check check check check and check please. Daily Show correspondent Demetri Martin makes little impression as Tiber and the rest of the cast tends to indulge stale 60s stereotypes although British thesp Imelda Staunton has some testy fun as Tibers Russian-immigrant mom. Its the kind of movie in which you know the acid just kicked in because the background suddenly goes all smeary-psychedelic (really? again?) and in which were prompted to chortle with retroactive knowingness at e.g. one promoters assurance that an upcoming free Rolling Stones concert will surely be a nonstop groovy lovefest. (I guess it counts as subtlety that he doesnt actually say the word ""Altamont."") Harmless enough but I expect a lot more from Lee and Schamus even after Hulk. Grade C+ (3) What was there no phone book handy? Michel Gondrys aunt Suzette an elderly retired schoolteacher seems to be a very nice lady but I have no idea why he or the Cannes selection committee imagined that Thorn in the Heart would be of interest to anyone outside of Gondrys immediate family. The title raises expectations of angst a-plenty but the tone throughout is one of warm regard; you could make a documentary about some random octogenarian plucked off the street and have a good shot at stumbling onto a more eventful and interesting life than Suzettes frankly. (I myself have an aunt who became a Carmelite nun as a teenager left the order some years later and now lives a mysterioso crypto-lesbian existence in which nobody knows where her money comes from or whether the women she lives with and brings on family vacations are her lovers or what. True story. Now accepting offers.) Be ready for impassioned defenses of this glorified home movie from rabid humanists who believe that nothing is more worthy of our attention than the banal details of an utterly nondescript life i.e. that ""we all have a fascinating story to tell."" No. We dont. Most people are dull from cradle to grave. THATS WHY MANKIND INVENTED ENTERTAINMENT. Grade D I didnt much like Tetro either but at least its a genuine work of imagination albeit one indebted to the overheated Oedipal dramas that were all the rage on Broadway when Francis Ford Coppola (who wrote the screenplay as well as directed for the first time since The Conversation) was an impressionable youth. Shot in stunningly gorgeous black-and-white (save for occasional color flashbacks) it tells the labored story of two brothers (Vincent Gallo and newcomer Alden Ehrenreich) living in the cold shadow of their father a world-renowned conductor (Klaus Maria Brandauer). How much you can roll with this deliberate throwback largely depends on how sick you are of artists working out their pathetic daddy issues; as you may have inferred how sick I am of that = unto death. Youth Without Youth may have been messier and more risible (though the climactic twist here is pretty damn dumb) but Ill take its dazzingly surreal middle third over this films endless declamatory hooey. Was it William Goldman or David Mamet who claimed that ""great cinematography"" is just a code phrase meaning ""the script stunk""? Tetro should win the Best Cinematography Oscar in a walk. Grade C+ Even scary French actress Marina de Van let me down today. Dont Look Back her second film behind the camera (and one of my most anticipated films of the festival) screws up everything that her gut-wrenching debut In My Skin got miraculously right. A big part of what made the earlier film so intensely disturbing is that its heroines descent into obsessive self-mutilation (bring the kids) has no apparent cause no glib Psych 101 explanation. Dont Look Back boasts an equally arresting premise A professional biographer attempting her first novel (Sophie Marceau) first sees objects in her house in different places than shes always remembered them then watches in horror as her husband and two children turn into different people altogether and then herself turns into Monica Bellucci (obviously an upgrade but never mind). This time however a traumatic and reductive incident from Marceau/Belluccis past is to blame--hence the title--which makes the entire film feel like the laborious setup for a dopey Twilight Zone twist. And where In My Skin was clinically detached and matter-of-fact Dont Look Back leans hard on a conventionally atonal musical score and cheap shock cuts as well as some dubious special effects. (At one point the protagonists face is half Marceau and half Bellucci which was clearly intended to be creepy but made half my audience bust out laughing.) That I can easily imagine an American remake is perhaps most damning of all. Grade C Tomorrow those nutty Koreans Hong Sang-soo and Bong Joon-ho plus Filipino newcomer Brillante Mendoza. At least one of those has gotta be a winner right?

Even with the ever-versatile Ang Lee behind the camera this messy historical fiction plays like a two hour ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch and not a very good one either. Demetri Martin plays young aspiring designer Elliot Tiber whose abrupt decision to lend his parents motel and music permit in Bethel New York to the folks behind the Woodstock Music Festival solidified his role in the cultivation of twentieth century American counterculture. Although the movie culls from Tibers memoirs it lacks any sense of authenticity. Instead we get an uninspired frustratingly simplistic depiction of both the event and the era as a whole. With the youthful Tibers amiably soft-spoken persona in the foreground ""Taking Woodstock"" theoretically had the potential to become a delightful coming-of-age story on the level of ""Almost Famous."" Unfortunately the pervasive superficiality of the performances and overly referential script rule that out from the very beginning. Martins stiff delivery might have worked if he was surrounded by an aura of credibility but rest of the cast complicates the issue. Liev Schriever as a cross-dressing security manager? I hate to admit it but hes better in ""Wolverine."" Imelda Staunton as a Tibers Yiddish-spouting mamele? Even Tovah Feldshuh would have been over the top. Paul Dano as a tripped-out hippy and Emile Hirsch as a wild Vietnam vet seem more like props than real people. The eye-rolling quotient is high in this movie but no higher than in the final scene when Jonathan Groff -- as head of the organization responsible for the event -- strolls into the arena riding a white horse gloriously announcing the next great moment in music history by hinting at the upcoming Altamont Free Concert. Sequel anyone? That moment works according to the same confounding logic of the movies opening Staunton watches television reports of war in Israel before flipping the channel where she conveniently discovers coverage of NASAs plan to land on the moon. ""Taking Woodstock"" contains many such blatant nods to history constantly stripping away the realism. Lees direction never does much to enliven the proceedings either. A split screen devise blatantly ripped from the classic ""Woodstock"" documentary just distracts from the action and an acid sequence falls low in the pantheon of cinematic acid trips. Occasional archival footage pops up in expository sequences which does little except provide a reminder that the real thing contained many more entertaining qualities than this undercooked project. Worst of all ""Taking Woodstock"" remains on the sidelines of event with only passing references to the actual music. That may pertain to the context of the story but it sure would have helped if the movie contained a catchier soundtrack.

Gentle genial and about as memorable as a mild reefer high ""Taking Woodstock"" takes a backdoor approach to revisit the landmark musical weekend through the antics and efforts of some of the people who made it happen. A sort of lets-put-on-a-show summer-camp lark for director Ang Lee after the dramatic rigors of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Lust Caution"" the picture serves up intermittent pleasures but is too raggedy and laid-back for its own good its images evaporating nearly as soon as they hit the screen. Set for release in August on the 40th anniversary of the event the Focus release looks like a mild B.O. contender. Completely endorsing the sanctified view of Woodstock as the one brief shining moment of the Age of Aquarius before it all got painted black four months later at Altamont James Schamus script focuses rather too much on how the experience liberated and transformed local fellow Elliot Teichberg who under the name Elliot Tiber wrote the book that inspired the film. Teichberg played a crucial role in making the festival happen at all having stepped in when the original permit was revoked to contact event producer Michael Lang and provide a base of operation at his parents ramshackle motel. Given the films vast canvas and ambition to provide a kaleidoscopic portrait of a generational movement Elliots personal issues -- his feelings of responsibility to his immigrant parents closeted gay status and general behavioral uptightness -- seem unduly magnified in relation to everything else thats going on. As played by comedian Demetri Martin Elliot (who in real life was 34 at the time older than the ""generation"" in question) is a mild-mannered unassertive guy without much electricity as a central screen presence. In the roles conception and casting Elliot is clearly patterned after Dustin Hoffmans Benjamin Braddock in ""The Graduate"" but the effect isnt remotely the same. Elliot -- whos returned to the Catskills from his career as a painter/designer in New York to help bail his parents out with mortgage problems on their dilapidated El Monaco Motel -- has no idea what hes getting into when he uses his influence to greenlight a local ""music and arts festival."" A counterculture theater company occupies his parents barn but as soon as cagey producer Lang (newcomer Jonathan Groff in a very effective turn) shows up the hippie invasion begins in earnest; the boost in tourism even inspires Mom and Pop (Brit thesps Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton) to spruce up the motel. Although some local opposition still tries to block the festival theres no stopping the tide once dairy farmer Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy) opens up his 600-acre property. A crude mob attempt to extort protection money from the Teichbergs is nipped in the bud by a macho ex-Marine in a dress and blond wig (a nice turn by Liev Schreiber) embittered Vietnam vet Billy (Emile Hirsch) tries to figure out how to reconcile with all this peace and love stuff and Elliot dares to publicly express his affection for a hunky construction worker. Despite being temporally defined by the run-up to the fest and the weekend itself the pic has a formless unstructured feel as its attention jumps from incident to incident in almost random fashion. Some distantly heard music serves notice that Woodstock itself has begun but the stage is only ever glimpsed from atop a faraway hill. The musical performances are clearly not the subject of the film but theres no denying that their absence makes ""Taking Woodstock"" feel oddly incomplete; the table is set but the meal never gets served. Instead Lee delivers a couple of setpieces intended to convey the magnitude and essence of the moment. The first involves a long ride by Elliot on a police motorcycle that slowly proceeds through a mass of vehicles and humanity on the road leading to the concert site; its a lovely visually overflowing scene marked by an almost eerie sense of calm and peacefulness and one that would have been welcome at considerably greater length. The other is a climactic acid trip taken by Elliot in the company of two comically mellow hippies (Paul Dano Kelli Garner) that allows Elliot to view the landscape of 500000 people below him as undulating waves of humanity. Inclined more to personal than societal politics the film keeps the parade of history in the background (the moon landing Vietnam and Middle East tensions are glimpsed on television). Other than the oddly extended attention devoted to the harsh irascibility of Elliots unbendingly greedy mother pic is pleasant enough on a moment-to-moment basis but the separate sketches never coalesce into anything like a full group portrait. Convincingly scruffy thesps look like the cast of the ""Hair"" revival multiplied by hundreds and the period re-creation is credible both in fashions and speech with a couple of exceptions in the latter case.
