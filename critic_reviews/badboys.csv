Comments (1) Bad Boys People who have Beverly Hills Cop and Miami Vice encoded in their nervous systems and are looking for restimulation may be amused by this formulaic sass machine and police procedural but I was writhing in my seat. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith play undercover Miami buddy cops who briefly exchange identities while holding a witness (Tea Leoni) in a drug murder under wraps and the banter is so heavy that the movie seems to be doing all your laughing for you. The cops never seem to know what theyre doing but then neither do the filmmakers though I cant imagine that casual audiences will care since there are plenty of big explosions at the end to reward them. Directed by Michael Bay from a script by several hacks; with Tcheky Karyo and Theresa Randle.

""Beverly Hills Cop"" meets ""Miami Vice"" in ""Bad Boys"" with predictably combustible results. After a dormant period the Simpson/Bruckheimer machine is back in working order with this ultraslick combination of expensive action rude attitude sassy humor trendy locations fast cars heavy soundtrack and decorous violence. With Martin Lawrence and Will Smith toplining as a two-for-one comedy replacement for Eddie Murphy in similar crime-busting material and with very little else in the marketplace of a muscular high-concept nature this brash jokey actioner could easily dominate the B.O. scene until the first wave of summer heavyweights arrives in May. This highly polished package is formulaic in the extreme designed as if to reassert the commercial credentials of one of the most successful producing partnerships of the 80s. Simpson amp; Bruckheimer have gone back to the basics that worked so well for them before -- a battle between irreverent (black) cops and ruthless (white) villains with huge amounts of drugs and money hanging in the balance and some babes and nightclubbing lightly sprinkled into the mix -- but with the added fillip of a case of mistaken identity providing a new comic dimension. In its own cal-culating cynical way it works. Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) are longtime friends whove been undercover partners on the Miami police force for six years. Marcus the goofier of the two is married with three kids and has had trouble finding ""quality time"" for a little hanky-panky with his wife while Mike is Mr. Cool a ladies man whose inheritance provided him with a swank apartment expensive threads and a top-of-the-line Porsche. In a zingy sequence some dazzlingly efficient crooks penetrate the bowels of the police department to make off with  100 million in packaged heroin the heroes recently confiscated in their ""career bust."" With 72 hours to solve the case before the feds step in Marcus and Mike plausibly suspect a corrupt ex-cop as being in on the job but hes knocked off by the real mastermind coldblooded Frenchman Fouchet (Tcheky Karyo) as is Max (Karen Alexander) a gorgeous high-class hooker and ex-girlfriend of Mikes. A friend of Maxs Julie (Tea Leoni) witnesses the slayings and is willing to help the cops but only if she deals directly with Mike of whom Max always spoke highly. With Mike temporarily detained Marcus is forced to impersonate his best friend in order to advance the case. This central ruse serves as the basis of much of the humor which is largely lowbrow stuff and based in the comedy of confusion embarrassment and humiliation. The bumbling and henpecked Marcus is forced to cohabit with the brassy Julie at Mikes lavishly appointed digs where he doesnt even know the location of the light switches and is forced to explain among other things why there are so many pictures of Mike around. At the same time Mike is obliged to move in with Marcus family and some of the biggest laughs stem from Marcus suspicions that his handsome buddy might be putting the moves on his wife (Theresa Randle). But domesticity is never allowed to dominate for long as the urgency to crack the case keeps intensifying. In one almost laughably implausible sequence inserted only to trot out sexy people in sexy clothes the good guys as well as their informant converge on an opulent 80s-style disco where the bad guys just happen to be hanging out resulting in a chaotic melee. Throughout pic is punctuated by the requisite number of intimidations beatings shootings explosions and chases all staged with knowing panache by 30-year-old first-time helmer Michael Bay who made his mark with his musicvideos and award-winning Miller Beer and milk commercials. The flash the dazzling surfaces the souped-up action and the impudent humor are all present in abundance just as anything remotely resembling dimensional human beings recognizable emotions and reality is absent. Naturally it all ends with a big showdown and chase involving the leads and the Eurotrash heavy setting the stage for a sequel to start the next day if the grosses warrant it. Crucially the teaming of standup favorite and ""Martin"" star Lawrence and ""Fresh Prince"" Smith clicks from the outset with both right at home handling action and comedy on the bigscreen. Even when its not particularly funny their interplay is engaging and their lively raucous personalities keep the proceedings punchy and watchable for the slightly overlong running time. Other perfs are colorful but one-note with Leoni called upon to complain too much as the cops key witness Karyo simply despicable as the big baddie and Joe Pantoliano amusingly overheated as the beleaguered head of the police narcotics division. Production values are as slick as they come. Miami settings provide a dazzling backdrop John Vallones production design reps everyones fantasy of the lush life and lenser Howard Atherton knows how to light anything to maximize its allure and luster. Soundtrack is crammed with Ramp;B and hip-hop tunes. Bad BoysProductionA Columbia Pictures release of a Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer production. Produced by Simpson Bruckheimer.

Directed by Michael Bay. (R. 126 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With "" Bad Boys "" we get another action comedy in what has become the ""48 HRS."" genre. The violence is realistic and as hard to take as any youll see on screen while the laughs come out of the silliest of character situations. TV stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith as the films bad-boy police detectives turn themselves into the classic Mutt-and-Jeff style comedy team. The lanky Smith has never seemed so smooth while Lawrence who is capable of acting smooth himself plays a nervous wreck -- a nonstop talker trying to hold everything together with a stream of words. ""Bad Boys"" which opens today benefits from Smith and Lawrences chemistry. As long as theyre on screen together things breeze along. But when theyre apart the movie flounders. This is only partly because of Martin Lawrence (left) and Will Smith are two Miami narcotics detectives before a high-stakes shootout in Bad Boys their appeal as a team. ""Bad Boys"" which is more than two hours long has more complications than it needs too many unnecessary flourishes. Its only when the two fellows are together that you can reasonably hope something important will happen. The story of ""Bad Boys"" surrounds the theft of millions of dollars worth of drugs confiscated from a Miami police warehouse by an evil French mastermind Fouchet played by Tcheky Karyo. This same Fouchet is shown coldbloodedly blowing away some perfectly nice very pretty young lady early in the picture. From that point on ""Bad Boys"" has a strong villain on its hands -- and the audience a strong interest in seeing this guy brought down. But ""Bad Boys"" doesnt stay focused. Midway it comes up with what somebody must have thought was a brilliant comic device and proceeds to beat it to death The two detectives for reasons not worth going into are forced to switch identities. So the ladies man Mike (Smith) moves in with his partners family while Marcus (Lawrence) spends day and night at Mikes place guarding the material witness an attractive available woman (Tea Leoni). You can see the comic possi bilities of this situation from a mile off and theyre no funnier close up The woman comes on to Marcus. Meanwhile Marcus becomes convinced that his partner is seducing his wife . . . and on and on. Maybe if the two guys were more different -- if Marcus were played by Wallace Shawn lets say -- the switch might have worked. But however hard he tries Lawrence never seems more than a couple of glasses of wine away from being just as cool as Smith. Here and there the film manages to get back on track. But a good half-hours worth of nonsense in the middle keeps ""Bad Boys"" from being little better than a break- even proposition.

Unfortunately Mel Gibson had already taken ""Hamlet"" and there was no male-buddy version of ""Long Days Journey Into Night"" available. So they opted for ""Bad Boys"" a cop drama in which the sitcom stud muffins play Crocket amp; Tubbs Riggs amp; Murtaugh Dumb amp; Dumberyou name it.It should come as no surprise that this endless spectacle of tired comedy routines and overblown action fare was produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer action-meisters of such 80s blockbusters as ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Top Gun."" And it should come as even less surprise that even by the low-low standards of cheap action flicks this ones bad boys. Miami detectives Smith (star of TVs ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"") and Lawrence (eponymous headliner of the show ""Martin"") are odd buddies for life. Smiths a tough rich ladykiller who likes being a cop. Overworked family man Lawrence who works for the money dreams of one hot night with his wife (Theresa Randle who wears a suspicious frown so long it seems only surgery can remove it). Smith drives fast. Lawrence tootles behind the wheel. Are you getting a feel for their profound character differences?Our law enforcement officers have their work cut out when Euro-mastermind Tcheky Karyo (the Machiavellian manipulator in ""La Femme Nikita"") steals 100 million worth of confiscated heroin from the police. They also have to safeguard witness Tea Leoni who saw Karyos goons deep-six a hooker contact of Smiths. (In this movie every womans either a friend or past score of Smiths.) As they quip through an eternity of explosions gun battles and hair-raising driving (directed by Michael Bay who has seen one ""Miami Vice"" rerun too many) Lawrence treats every moment as a cue for an unsuccessful improv routine Smith plays the (inevitably shirtless) straight man and Leoni basically shows off her legs. In a way they deserve each other. BAD BOYS (R)  Contains sexist epithets profanity and violence.

"Bad Boys Related Item Go to Video Finder Bad Boys By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer April 07 1995 Director Michael Bay Cast Martin Lawrence; Will Smith; Tea Leoni; Tcheky Karyo; Karen Alexander; Theresa Randle violence profanity and nudity Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa ""Bad Boys"" is relentless formulaic fodder for the explosion-starved; its loud shallow sexist and a complete waste of time. But this buddy cop thriller is not without its problems.Basically its already a sequel. The irreverent heroesMarcus (comedian Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith)have been partners for years and best friends since they were kids. They dont have to get to know each others strengths overcome their differences or learn to trust each other. This means the films highly paid quartet of writers had to stick some other sort of story between all the expletives.Where others might have seen a daunting task these pen-pushers found an opportunity to pay homage to ""Lethal Weapon II."" They give the buddies a sidekick Julie (Tea Leoni); alas the listless Leoni delivers her lines much as a disgruntled postal worker dispenses mail. No zip in her code.Julie witnesses the murder of a high-priced hooker Max (Karen Alexander) a close friend of Mike who is a smooth ladies man. She offers to help the cops solve the crime but only if she deals directly with Mike. Alas Mike is off duty and goofy family man Marcus must impersonate his friend.The ruse helps complicate the otherwise routine plot but it doesnt do a thing to increase the buddies understanding of each others lives. Mostly the henpecked sexually deprived Marcus worries that he is being cuckolded by his handsome best friend. Mike who is independently wealthy and doesnt really need to be a cop worries about the pricey stuff in his apartment where Julie and her poodles are in protective custody.Domestics quickly give way to ballistics as the partners set off in pursuit of a villainous Frenchman and his trigger-happy henchmen. One of them shot Max but more importantly the gang stole 100 million worth of heroin from the police department. It was the evidence in the partners biggest-ever bust.There are shootouts and chase scenes set against the palmy scenery of Miami where the vice is perpetrated. None is memorable for its inventiveness but the mayhem is discharged with professionalism by first-time director Michael Bay of music video and Miller Beer commercial fame. (Theres not a whole lot of difference between a beer advert and an action movie Both are aimed at guys and feature plenty of scantily clad babes.)As usual in this genre the womens roles all stink; females are on board principally to prevent the fellows from having fun. Despite everything ""Bad Boys"" can be great fun when the bantering buddies are in hot pursuit of the bad guys. Lawrence and Smith click so get ready for the next sequel. Hey whatcha gonna do?Bad Boys is rated R for violence profanity and nudity.

"Bad Boys | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bad-boys ) Bad Boys (United States 1995) A movie review by James Berardinelli 48 Hours Beverly Hills Cop and Lethal Weapon were all to some extent reasonably entertaining action films. The unavoidable result of their success has been a long string of sequels and rip-offs. The latest is Bad Boys an overlong sample of MTV-style direction that ""borrows"" heavily from these (and numerous other) flicks and in the process elevates them to the comparable level of Citizen Kane. The action sequences -- and there are a lot of them -- are apparently designed to camouflage the lack of a credible story. I suppose someone guessed that if the audience was too busy following bullets bodies and explosions they wouldnt have time to wonder about things like logic and coherence. Unfortunately the movie contains occasional moments of inactivity and during those the first thing that comes to mind is Whats the point? After asking the question a few times it becomes clear that not only are things moving fast but theyre completely out of control. Consider what happens to a downhill skier or race car in this situation and you get an idea of what Bad Boys has to offer. When it came to putting ideas on paper the writers had a beginning (a drug heist from the Miami P.D.s evidence safe) and an ending (guess what happens to the bad guys). They also had a premise take a couple of mismatched cops who hide their respect for each other and team them with a female civilian/witness who is destined to prove her worth but only after botching things a few times. No its not original but its the only glue that holds this production together even if it is spread far too thin. Because outside of these few basics from script writing 101 no thought was put into the screenplay for Bad Boys. The cops Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowrey are played by TV sitcom stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith. For reasons too silly to explain theyre forced to swap identities whenever theyre with a murder witness (Tea Leoni). If there ever was comic potential in this unnecessarily contrived situation its not realized. I think Threes Company may have done the same thing only better. Much better. Smith and Lawrence are likable and they have a certain modest chemistry that surfaces during the so-called ""humorous"" banter but everything about their characters is a regurgitation of previously recycled material. (Does that make it re-recycled?) The other characters are equally familiar the tough female sidekick the loyal wife (Theresa Randle) the evil drug lord (Tcheky Karyo) and the loud-mouthed police captain (Joe Pantoliano). The most complimentary thing I can say about Bad Boys is that it has style and energy. The cinematography is frequently inventive and Mark Mancinis Speed-like score is the perfect accompaniment for chases and fights. Unfortunately theres only so far a movie can go on loud music nicely-framed shots testosterone and adrenaline. Bad Boys takes the often-traveled road and leads the audience to a dead end.

Every bit as central to the movie however are the buddies behind the camera-Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer the outrageously successful production team of the commodified 80s. Beginning with that porno-aerobic synth-pop daydream Flashdance (always one of my guilty pleasures) and continuing on through Beverly Hills Cop Top Gun and Days of Thunder Simpson and Bruckheimer created an aesthetic that delivered the adrenaline thrust of a cocaine high. Their movies were rushes-slickly galvanic fantasies greased by propulsive rock soundtracks that whizzed from climax to climax. That the Simpson-Bruckheimer pictures were such big hits all but defining mainstream entertainment in the Reagan era practically became a part of their aesthetic In the end you couldnt separate the victories of the films heroes-the sensation of ""triumph"" as a power-tripping adolescent high-from the films own victories at the box office. (The real message was always ""Feel the grosses."") But the producers careers began to falter with Beverly Hills Cop II which in the midst of not even bothering to make Eddie Murphy funny came off as a series of cliches exploding in your face. Bad Boys marks an unwelcome return to the fragmented onslaught of late- period Simpson-Bruckheimer; sitting through the movie with its generic rude-boy heroes is like watching Beverly Hills Cop XI and XII at the same time. Theres a spark of canniness in casting Lawrence and Smith against type. Smith the clean-cut sitcom prince plays the swinging bachelor and Lawrence notorious for the raunchiness of his stand-up routines is the devoted family man. Through a series of convolutions too labored to describe the two scramble to trade roles in order to win the trust of a witness (Tea Leoni) in a murder case. Lawrence and Smith are winningly smooth comic actors. Smith especially holds the camera with his matinee-idol sexiness and his quicksilver delivery of such lines as ""Youre driving almost slow enough to drive Miss Daisy"" If only there were a few more lines like it. For most of its two-hour running time Bad Boys buries the appeal of its stars under a bombardment of high- decibel ""thrills."" This is the buddy movie as higher noise-the insult humor mashed into gunplay mashed into car chases mashed into a scene of someone getting tossed through an aquarium. Of course the Simpson-Bruckheimer approach may still work at the box office (the only place it ever really mattered anyway). By now though Id like to think most moviegoers have had a permanent overdose.
