Unlike Mary Poppins however Nanny McPhee is ugly; grotesque even. But while barely recognisable writer-star Emma Thompson gradually sheds the exaggerated prosthetics (hairy warts bulbous nose etc.) each time the children learn a valuable lesson. Quite why nobody explains the film barely acknowledges its supernatural themes.That McPhee appears to use magic to control the kids is secondary to the more involving story of the potential romance between their father Mr Brown (Colin Firth) and the maid (Kelly Macdonald) their union impeded by Great Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) who insists Brown marry a suitable bride. While contrived this storyline introduces the films most humorous character showy money-grabbing widow Mrs Quickly (Celia Imrie). But that Nanny McPhee herself is so unengaging undermines the films impact making it pleasing but ultimately unsatisfying.

That goes double for the adults. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Nanny McPhee Childrens movie. Starring Emma Thompson and Colin Firth. Directed by Kirk Jones. (PG. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Nanny McPhee"" is a lively colorful childrens film with a satisfying story and an arch sensibility that will especially appeal to adults. But it has something extra as well something every childrens story needs a dark unconscious. Underlying the story is sadness a sense of mystery and a quality of pain. Enjoy the movie for its surface pleasures but when its over its those subterranean qualities that will keep it lingering in the mind. In a seemingly blithe way the movie captures an aspect of child consciousness not usually explored onscreen -- that zone between innocence and knowledge. For the seven children of the widowed Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) life and the ways of adults remain mysteries but the children cant help but sense that the answers to those mysteries when they come might not be satisfying complete or reassuring after all. Thus the children are fantastically naughty throwing food painting the piano pretending to eat the infant sibling. Their freneticism and the ways in which they stay together as a pack constitute their effort to stave off adult consciousness to keep moving and playing so that knowledge cant accidentally sneak in. Mr. Brown in despair at being unable to retain a nanny for his unruly kids is surprised one evening by the arrival of Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) a grave and disconcertingly homely woman with two large moles a huge nose and a snaggletooth that hangs over her bottom lip. She carries a walking stick that gives her magical powers so that when the children claim for example that they have measles and cant get out of bed they indeed get measles and become stuck in their beds. Nanny McPhee is a real-life nanny a supernatural emissary and a walking metaphor. On several occasions she tells the children ""When you need me but dont want me Ill stay. When you want me but no longer need me Ill go."" Its an enigmatic and arresting statement that like much in ""Nanny McPhee"" seems to mean much more than is apparent. She is the bridge between a childs fantastic worldview and an adults sober understanding. She provides a last gasp of magic as she guides the children toward a grounded footing in the world. All this sounds terribly serious but the moment-by-moment experience of ""Nanny McPhee"" is anything but that. The talented British cast plays it broad and for laughs. With the most affected speech imaginable Angela Lansbury eats up the scenery as Mr. Browns aunt a wealthy stuffed shirt. Derek Jacobi turns up in a minor role as one of Mr. Browns gossipy and boisterous assistants and Celia Imrie swings wild as the wicked vulgar harpy whom Mr. Brown may be forced to marry. Yet an edge of seriousness is always present. The children live in fear of being split up and sent to an orphanage if the family finances dont improve and death hangs over the movie from its first moments -- the untimely loss of Mrs. Brown is conveyed by a single empty chair. Mr. Brown himself is a mortician which means that entire conversations take place in his workroom a different corpse on the slab each time. The presence of the corpses is amusing honest and macabre which is an accurate description of the tone director Kirk Jones maintains throughout. Thompson wrote the screenplay based on Christianna Brands ""Nurse Matilda"" books and she gives Nanny McPhee a melancholy awareness. She remains reserved throughout. At the finish the children may know as much as the adults but Nanny knows more than the adults including the adults in the audience. Shes not smiling and shes not telling. -- Advisory A few corpses.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Nanny McPhee"" with Emma Thompson Colin Firth Kelly Macdonald Angela Lansbury Celia Imrie Imelda Staunton. Directed by Kirk Jones from a screenplay by Thompson based on the ""Nurse Matilda"" books by Christianna Brand. 98 minutes. Rated PG for mild thematic elements some rude humor and brief language. Several theaters. Id never heard of the ""Nurse Matilda"" series of childrens books but if theyre anything like the delightful film that they inspired clearly Ive missed something. ""Nanny McPhee"" directed by Kirk Jones and adapted from Christianna Brands books by Emma Thompson (who also plays the title character) is wildly colorful funny sweet and very very British -- and what more could one ask? Naughty (and nice) children of all ages particularly little girls should gobble this one up and rightly so. Colin Firth looking a tad weary (as well he might when you get to know his character) plays Mr. Brown a widower and father of seven very very naughty children. (Well six are naughty; the jurys still out on baby Agatha.) Led by ringleader Simon (Thomas Sangster of ""Love Actually"" who has a wonderfully devilish grin) this out-of-control band gets up to the sort of mischief that may inspire a few questionable ideas in the audience beheading their teddy bears painting the piano keys mashing up socks with the mashed potatoes. Despite Mr. Browns efforts no nanny will stay in the household -- until on a dark night Nanny McPhee arrives. Clearly this lady comes from the same magic-nanny-training school from whence Mary Poppins sprang and there are certainly similarities in the two stories. Nanny McPhee like her counterpart uses her powers to restore order to a household and to help the children realize their love for their family and then vanishes presumably off to another household in need. Perhaps the two of them meet between gigs swapping stories over sherry at a nanny bar in the clouds. Unlike Mary Poppins though Nanny McPhee is a bit alarming at first glance a bulbous nose a huge protruding tooth a variety of moles and a trademark grunt. But her appearance changes as the movie progresses and you wonder if were merely seeing her through the childrens eyes As they grow to know and love her she becomes more beautiful to them. Thompson is of course steely-toned perfection as the nanny who has an unnerving way of materializing in a room when you least expect her. Firth who wears frock coats and sputters out lines like ""Im dreadfully late for a vital tea dance"" is well-cast as is Kelly Macdonald as the familys sweet scullery maid Evangeline. (Listen closely to the newly educated Evangeline late in the film Macdonald is impeccably channeling Audrey Hepburn in the second half of ""My Fair Lady."") Angela Lansbury absent from movies for many years trumpets effectively as Mr. Browns grim Aunt Adelaide. And the kids are a kick right down to the gurgling twin infants Hebe and Zinnia Barnes who play Agatha and whose names clearly indicate that theyre destined for greatness. I was particularly fond of a bespectacled middle brother in tweedy sweater vests who looks like a very small classics professor and a moon-eyed little girl who fetchingly sighs ""Ive always known I was destined for tragedy."" Enormous credit must be given here to production designer Michael Howells and costume designer Nic Ede whove created a glorious joyride of color. The film is set vaguely in late Victorian/early Edwardian times and the Browns house is pure gingerbread filled with bright splotches of color as if from a childrens paintbox. The final scene in an enchanting August snowstorm conjured by Nanny McPhee is truly magical; even grown-up children may well find their breath taken away.

But what of Nanny McPhee? She dresses in black and exploits necromancy as a disciplinary tool so that makes her a magical nanny -- though Mary Poppins never threatened to boil an infant girl. Her buck tooth two hairy warts and 100-watt nose classify her as an ugly nanny. Her gradual transformation into Emma Thompson (who emerges from facial prosthetics as butterfly from cocoon chick from egg plumber from sink) also qualifies her however belatedly as a pretty nanny. She isnt American. I dont know if shes a virgin. But Ill say this for Nanny McPhee Technically she isnt a dog. You cant say the same for the movie a howling headache-inducer that features bratty urchins prone to torturing people and a color scheme resplendent with hot-pink bustiers and peeling lime paint. Fans of accomplished thespians will be either tickled or horrified to learn that Colin Firth Derek Jacobi and Angela Lansbury (with a fake schnozz to rival Thompsons) all emote with fantastic energy and commitment if by ""fantastic"" ""energy"" and ""commitment"" we mean ""wind up with smushed cake on their faces during films climactic wedding scene."" The person getting married (or not) is Cedric Brown (Firth) a recently widowed undertaker whose seven unruly children have made life hell for count em 17 consecutive nannies. The 17th departed after the elder six kids pretended to roast and eat the youngest. As an encore they gagged the cook seized control of the kitchen and added dirty socks to the stock pot yum This latest reign of terror prompts the arrival of Nanny McPhee (Thompson) who thumps a magic cane in her quest to turn each unsavory impulse into a learning experience. They tie up the cook? Nanny McPhee casts a spell that forces them to nearly kill the woman. They fake the measles? Nanny McPhee gives them the measles for real. It goes unsaid that behind all the tough-love spell casting hides a real softie; she has only their best interests at heart. As does the movie. Directed by Kirk Jones (who took a much defter hand to Waking Ned Devine) from a script by Thompson it was inspired by Christianna Brands classic Aunt Matilda stories which follow the mischievous Brown brood as they victimize a string of governesses. But unlike last years far-superior A Series of Unfortunate Events Nanny McPhee liquefies halfway through boiling down every nasty urge into a mawkish soup of fairyland cliches. Despite a dash of wit here and a repulsive baddie there (Celia Imrie as a go-go garish moneygrubber) the result is narrative chaos. What begins as grotesque and bitter quickly turns comely and saccharine. My kids enjoyed this transformation. I did not. I just didnt buy it -- not the munching-on-roast-baby business at the beginning not the giggly food fight at the end. As one young reprobate declares ""We got rid of the last 17 nannies. Were getting rid of this one too."" You do that boy-o. And not a moment too soon. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot Tamrac 28"" ZipShot Mini Compact Camera Tripod for 10 + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Her hair is like a nest beneath a bonnet. And her nose makes the one Nicole Kidman wore in ""The Hours"" a thing of exquisite refinement. Shes got warts - two of em - with hair. And then theres that tooth that one that stands out against her drawn mouth like a confusing frightening mistake. And yet Nanny McPhee is a thing of beauty. Rather the movie that bears her name directed with deft timing by Kirk Jones and written with loving brilliance by star Emma Thompson is a winning tale of naughty children in need of love and the mysterious governess who comes to their aid. ""Nanny McPhee"" begins with the image of a comfy but empty armchair. Were not the chair abandoned there would be no story were told by the narrator. The occupant of that chair has died and left her widower with seven children. As soon as you get a look at this rebellious brood youll feel its obvious why the lady of the house took a much deserved rest. Since his dears departure Mr. Brown (Colin Firth) has made ends meet as the makeup man at the nearby funeral parlor. Under the impressive leadership of eldest Simon (Thomas Sangter) the children have just managed to send their 17th nanny running. And she was considered a tough bird. But they played a creatively ghastly gag on her and off she went. Good help is hard to keep in the Brown household. If it had not been written into her contract that the children were not allowed in the kitchen Mrs. Blatherwick would have been long gone. But Evangeline (Kelly MacDonald) her assistant never would have. She has a soft spot for the children. Though one of them replies with painful awareness when she says shes fond of them ""Yes but youre servant youre paid to like us."" When the single father goes to the agency for No. 18 hes rebuffed. Closed. Not here. There are no more nannies. But a nanny by the name of McPhee is available for hard cases. ""The person you need is Nanny McPhee"" advises a strange voice. Brown doesnt find her. She finds him. By the way the part about the making ends meet above was something of an exaggeration. Mr. Brown played by Firth with the sort of hysterical male hysteria Cary Grant used to humorous advantage in screwball comedies has relied on the financial aid of his dead wifes Aunt Adelaide. Angela Lansbury has wicked fun delivering Adelaides unkind observations and crueler ultimatums. Her latest has forced him into seeking a wife. His only prospect Mrs. Quickly is unsuitable of course. Jones and company have made tasty eye candy of this tale based on Christianna Brands Nurse Matilda books. Fun wordplay meets its match in physical comedy. And none of it relies as so many childrens films do on pop cultural references. I cant vouch for the novels but what Thompson has done in adapting them is a marvel. Not a surprise though We knew from her fine version of ""Sense and Sensibility"" that shes got a gift. Or two. In another lifetime Nanny McPhee might have been played by Julie Andrews. But Thompson comes with her own exquisite magic. Shes got an odd walk an amusing way of tilting her head. And Thompson and Firth know how to keep a good gag running throughout the childrens journey from naughty to nicer. Certain outcomes arent obvious so much as they are hoped for. What will become of sweet self-improving Evangeline who sacrifices herself when the children make a tactical error? Hmmm as McPhee would say. When she arrives McPhee has five lessons to impart to the children To go to sleep when theyre told. Get up when theyre told. And a few more seemingly simple tasks. ""When you need me but do not want me then I must stay"" she cautions when they first meet. ""When you want me but no longer need me then I have to go."" You know in the end they will miss her. But you may be caught by surprise at your own sweet sadness.

"Mischief meets its match in lively Nanny - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Mischief meets its match in lively Nanny By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 27 2006 Whenever Im asked if theres a genre of movie I dislike I usually claim to be open to anything."" Im lying apparently. Sitting through the first 15 minutes of Nanny McPhee"" I realized I hate movies about bad kids.Specifically kids whose dead or divorced parents give them license to terrorize a movie audience. Ultimately though the films impart to them a balmy family lesson. Are We There Yet?"" and Zathura"" are that sort of picture. And to some extent so is The Chronicles of Narnia.""Nanny McPhee"" is more of the same but with a pleasing difference The children are tortured right back which makes for a jolly time at the movies.The Browns -- six insolent monsters and one helpless infant living in the English countryside -- are an obnoxious brood indeed. Since their mother died theyve scared off 17 nannies. Each new conquest is posted on a chart and the kids useless mortician father Cedric (Colin Firth) must go begging for a new one.Just as the children set about destroying the kitchen and pouncing on my last nerve the Browns doorbell rings and in steps Emma Thompson as Nanny McPhee a severe stupendously unappetizing woman. She has two warts a bulbous snout a blotchy complexion and one snaggletooth. More crucially she also has a psycho-killer gleam in her eyes.With a stamp of her walking stick the childrens pointless horseplay is given a functional hyperactive twist. Vegetables fly violently into a boiling caldron and Simon (Thomas Sangster) the broods recalcitrant leader cant stop maniacally stirring.Nanny has five lessons of obedience to share but it wont be easy.I never say please"" exclaims Simon. Of course the kids act up for a reason. Theyre mad that their father never makes time for them because hes obsessed with finding a new wife. Theyre not the only ones. The familys angelic housekeeper Evangeline (Kelly MacDonald) has a crush on her boss and can sense the good in his children which given their behavior is impossible like Superman being able to see through lead.Cedric has reasons for obsessing over a replacement mostly owing to a Dickensian arrangement with his aunt-in-law played by a hawk-nosed Angela Lansbury with a disdain that makes Judi Dench seem warm. Great-Aunt Adelaide has been supporting the Browns and will cut Cedric off unless he remarries. Barring that shell take one of his daughters.The scheme to avoid losing one of the girls and the frantic search for a wife turns up Celia Imrie as an outlandish widow and puts lots of farm critters to work in a way that always leaves kids tickled. Adults meanwhile will appreciate the casts gusto. The child actors are unusually good much better than the tykes in Narnia."" Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow playing Cedrics co-workers are the Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum of undertaking. And Imelda Staunton is a riot as the Browns frazzled cook.Thompson adapted the screenplay from Christianna Brands Nurse Matilda"" books and she and director Kirk Jones balance the slapstick and levity with darker enchantments. At its most enjoyable the film feels like Roald Dahls idea of Mary Poppins"" -- and on occasion The Sound of Music."" Who else are the Browns if not a devilish edition of the von Trapps?I wish Thompson were in more movies. Here she sends up both of Julie Andrewss governess roles but not heartlessly. Thompson is steely where Andrews was huggable. Shes tough because tough is what spoiled kids need. She wont spare them her rod. When her work here is done I know some kids in Narnia who might deserve her services. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

She also shares a resemblance to classic fairy godmothers -- if one can envision such a kindly persona dressed all in black sporting a pair of matching warts and a cabbage-shaped nose. In Nanny McPhee Emma Thompson plays the serious disciplinarian who is not too much like Mary Poppins. Universal Studios Emma Thompson stars as the governess who whips seven rambunctious undisciplined children into shape through her calm wisdom and casual magic. Her philosophy on child-rearing is not about spoons full of sugar. But its not exactly castor oil and scratchy woolens either. After the children have chased away 17 nannies in record time McPhee appears out of the blue claiming to be ""a government nanny."" About the movie Nanny McPhee    (out of four) Stars Emma Thompson Colin Firth Angela Lansbury Director Kirk Jones Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG for mild thematic elements some rude humor and brief language Running time 1 hour 37 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Her message is simple ""When you need me but do not want me then I will stay. When you want me but do not need me then I have to go."" Upon explaining this Nanny waits a beat and adds ""Its rather sad really."" Thompson does a lovely job as the mysterious babysitter who comes in the nick of time to straighten out the brood belonging to the kindly but distracted widower Cedric Brown. Cedric is played with affability and charm by Colin Firth. Both Thompson and Firths performances are understated. But in their storybook roles most of the adult supporting players -- who include some of Britains best character actors -- are over-the-top in their portrayals. Angela Lansbury with a nose that would put Nicole Kidmans as Virginia Woolf in The Hours to shame plays Firths great aunt. She insists that he marry again to receive her much-needed financial assistance. Imelda Staunton is the ruddy-faced cook. Kelly Macdonald is the sweet-natured scullery maid and Derek Jacobi and Patrick Barlow are silly funeral assistants. Celia Imrie plays the garishly costumed over-eager Selma Quickley whom Cedric seems doomed to marry. Cedric is overwhelmed with the task of raising seven children alone on his meager earnings from working at a funeral home. Some of the storys threads are underdeveloped and his professions tale is one of them. But with the passel of mischievous children and slew of farm animals living in a slightly off-kilter world reminiscent of Babe Nanny McPhee engages and amuses as a story for children from 5-12. It also has enough verbal wit to keep adults entertained. The films look fashioned by production designer Michael Howells is noteworthy for its vibrant colors and fantastical feel. With a timeless occasionally Gothic influence Nanny McPhee feels a bit like Lemony Snicket meets Mary Poppins. The movie based on the Nurse Matilda books by Christianna Brand is not startlingly original with its motherless children and evil stepmother story line. But those well-worn storybook features are woven effectively into an appealing tale of youthful empowerment and whimsy.

With several strategically placed warts to complete the portrait Thompson is virtually unrecognizable. But all the prosthetics in the world cannot obscure her gifts.The ""Nurse Matilda"" books by Christiana Brand are the source material for this intermittently delightful fantasy that Thompson herself adapted. You may recall that she won the screenwriting Oscar for Ang Lees ""Sense and Sensibility."" She has a feeling for the intricacies of language and how people interact under duress that works as well for Brand as for Austen.Nanny McPhee is the latest hire of the widower Mr. Brown (Colin Firth). The 16 previous nannies have all been undone by Browns brood of seven rapscallions led by the oldest Simon (Thomas Sangster from ""Love Actually""). Initially it looks as if she too will fall victim to their antics. But the septet are no match for her poise. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In the journal that Thompson kept during the making of this film she wrote ""Nanny McPhee should sound ageless classless and always calm. In a way shes like a Zen master."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Nothing Mary Poppins-ish about her.It would have been easy for Thompson to camp it up or to wink at us from under the facial camouflage. Instead she gives McPhee a gravitas that provides the movie with a deep core of feeling. The life lessons she imparts to the children or to their father for that matter are not simple ones. She recognizes that these motherless children are in need of succor but she never plays down to them. She respects them.The filmmakers respect us as well which is highly unusual for a childrens movie. But then again how can you make a good childrens movie without that respect? The Brown brood behave like real kids - they dont have that pampered and overrehearsed look common to most Hollywood child actors. I could have done without the baby who through the magic of special effects is made to speak but thats a trifling criticism.A larger one is that the director Kirk Jones doesnt really have the visual imagination to match Thompsons performance or screenplay. Jones was the writer-director of ""Waking Ned Devine"" and he tends to indulge in boisterous set pieces like the big pie-throwing finale here. It just looks like a lot of actors having a food fight.But what actors The great Miriam Margolyes has a wonderful cameo as a scullery maid and Colin Firth manfully endures a face full of frosting. And then theres Angela Lansbury playing her first movie role in 20 years as the villainous Aunt Adelaide. Her performance small though it is reminded me of how wonderful she is and how much she has been missed in the movies. (For sheer matriarchal wickedness no one has ever topped her in ""The Manchurian Candidate."")Adelaide is attempting to force Mr. Brown to marry a golddigging crone (Celia Imre) or else lose custody of his kids. The comeuppance of both women was the occasion for applause at my child-friendly screening. Its a happy sound when children in a theater are carried along by a story. Grade B+ Rated PG for mild thematic elements some rude humor and brief language.Sex/Nudity 2 instances of innuendo. Violence 5 comic scenes. Profanity 1 very mild expression.

"Nanny McPhee | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nanny-mcphee ) Nanny McPhee (United Kingdom 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Nanny McPhee is an excellent moviea| if youre a seven-year old girl. Thats less a negative evaluation than it is a statement of fact. This isnt a ""family film;"" its a ""childrens film."" Whats more its for girls who are old enough to understand the basics of reading and writing but not old enough to be interested in boys. Thats a small target audience for a motion picture but if you have a child that fits the above description you could find a worse way to entertain them than Nanny McPhee. Just dont expect to get the same level of enjoyment out of the experience as your offspring. Despite the superb cast comprised of A-level British actors the script offers nothing remotely adult. Its a straightforward fairy tale told without a hint of guile or cynicism. And there are none of the oh-so-popular elements that go over the head of the youngsters to score points with older viewers. Nanny McPhee is sweet and endearing but its neither smart nor witty. And it is predictable to a fault. 15 minutes into the movie not only will you guess the ending but you will recognize every step that leads to the ending. Watching Nanny McPhee for the first time is like watching many other movies for the second time. For adults the acting almost saves the film. On screen we have the likes of Colin Firth Emma Thompson Angela Lansbury Derek Jacobi Imelda Staunton and Kelly Macdonald. Thats an abundance of talent for something so thin. And none of the performers do bad jobs either although most are called upon to play caricatures. The problem is either Emma Thompsons screenplay or the source material upon which she based it Christianna Brands Nurse Matilda books. (Not being familiar with the latter Im not in a position to judge.) The films director is Kirk Jones whose lone previous feature was the delightful Waking Ned Devine. The magic of that film is absent here. Then again maybe everyone realized they were making a movie for seven-year old girls. In that case they have succeeded. Its the rest of us who are left with an unsatisfactory experience. (Its probably not a coincidence that Emma Thompsons daughter turns seven this year.) The story which borrow liberally from a library of established fairy tales (most notably ""Cinderella"") features the widower Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) in a quandary about what to do with his seven misbehaving children. Led by Simon (Thomas Sangster) the eldest and the ringleader they have a history of driving away nannies. Outside of their father only one other loves the children Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald) the scullery maid. Enter Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson) a crone of a witch who believes she can restore order to the Brown household. She works by a single rule which she tells the children ""When you need me but do not want me then I will stay. When you want me but do not need me then I have to go."" There are more complications in Cedrics life than the unruliness of his offspring. Great Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury) who provides Cedric with enough money to support his family has decreed that he must marry again within a month. Ignoring Evangeline the perfect candidate under his roof (she is after all a scullery maid) he makes a pact with the rapacious Selma Quickly (Celia Imrie) who bears a striking resemblance to an unsavory breed known as the Wicked Stepmother. Colin Firth plays Cedric as the most impotent man on Earth an individual who managed to mature into adulthood without a fully formed backbone. Emma Thompson makes sure we know that Nanny McPhee is made of sterner stuff. She looks like the Wicked Witch of the West (without the greenish cast to her skin) although her appearance improves with each step forward made by the children. Shes no Mary Poppins. When she delivers a dose of an anti-measles tonic she does not sing ""A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down."" Kelly Macdonald is as delightful as ever - shes this movies Cinderella. Angela Lansbury largely unrecognizable to Murder She Wrote fans under the makeup plays Aunt Adelaide as a nearsighted version of Pride amp; Prejudices Lady Catherine de Bourg. Finally there are the seven children who get us to the point where we despise them before coming to sympathize with them. Nanny McPhee is perfect for little girls. Theres no bad language or violence. Theres nothing close to resembling a sexual comment or innuendo. Theres true love the princess factor and a gloriously over-the-top finale that features a combination of a white wedding and a food fight. The good guys are rewarded and the best guys get their just desserts. As an adult however I couldnt help but thinking that this was a missed opportunity and a little fracturing of the fairy tale (A! lA  Shrek for example) would have made the experience less tiresome. But thats not where Nanny McPhees heart is. The result is a surprisingly bland movie that has its occasional pleasures small though they may be.

Working Titles latest attempt to crack the lucrative family market after the sputtering ""Thunderbirds"" ""Nanny McPhee"" finds the Brit shingle returning to a cozy comfort zone with a ""Mary Poppins""-like tale of naughty well-heeled tykes tamed by a magical child-minder. Even with its clipped English accents ""Nanny"" should prove a lucrative (especially on ancillary) and exportable property with its name cast led by Emma Thompson and Colin Firth a spoonful of sugary morality and a kidcentric mindset suitable for female tots. Pic opened wide in Blighty Oct. 21 with a 4.6 million opening weekend good for second place between ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" and ""Tim Burtons Corpse Bride."" Universal has pegged U.S. bow for Jan. 27. Film based loosly on Christianna Brands ""Nurse Matilda"" childrens books of the 1960s is set in a fantasy version of the late Victorian period. However script by Thompson often feels like a G-rated version of one of Working Titles contempo adult-oriented successes with its single-parent set up (""About a Boy"") and subplot about a cross-tracks romance (""Love Actually"" ""Bridget Joness Diary"") between lead grown-up Mr. Brown (WT regular Firth) and scullery maid Evangeline (Kelly Macdonald). Even the slapstick recalls WT hits like ""Johnny English"" and ""Bean."" Funeral director Mr. Brown (Firth) -- recently bereaved good-hearted but hopeless inept at parenting -- has been left with seven children from pubescent Simon (Thomas Sangster ""Love Actually"") down to infant Agatha (twins Hebe and Zinnia Barnes). Since mom died the Brown brood has gone through 17 nannies due to unruly behavior and such antics as pretending to have eaten the baby. What the pint-sized hooligans dont know is that if dad doesnt marry within a month his late wifes Aunt Adelaide (Angela Lansbury channeling Joyce Grenfell but with a beaky nose) will cut off a much-needed allowance forcing the family to be split up. Propriety keeps Brown from proposing to the object of his affection comely domestic Evangeline (Macdonald) who clearly (if mutely) returns his regard. The only plausible candidate Brown can think of is mite-too-merry widow Mrs. Quickly (Celia Imrie in a ripe turn whose corseted embonpoint amply fills the widescreen frame). In the meantime a new nanny must be found. One evening the frightening physiognomy of Nanny McPhee (Thompson festooned with warts and a monobrow plus padding under her black dress) turns up on the Browns doorstep. A rap of her magic walking stick on the floor forces the rioting rugrats in the kitchen to free the cook Mrs. Blatherwick (Imelda Staunton) who theyve trussed to the table. Thus endeth Nanny McPhees first lesson Go to bed when youre told. In due course the Brown family and not just the children learns four further lessons -- from the prosaic ""dress when you are told"" to the more homiletic ""listen"" -- plus more in true movie fashion about themselves. After each lesson Nanny McPhee loses a wart or blemish as her beauty blossoms out of the childrens growing love for her. Fables didacticism is right up there on the surface and some auds may cringe at the way pic needles middle-class anxieties about parenting skills -- a fashionable topic on TV these days. But under the surface the movie has a streak of Roald Dahl-style darkness that dilutes the sugar. Helming by Kirk Jones is as brisk and efficient as in his previous comedy ""Waking Ned Devine"" and he shows the same skill at keeping perfs on a fine cusp between British pantomime and standard cinematic clowning. Kiddie casts cut-glass drama-school diction fits the characters well-to-do milieu although non-British viewers may find it more charming than indigenous auds. Supporting players like Staunton Imrie and Derek Jacobi (""In the Night Garden ... "") and Patrick Barlow (as Browns oleaginous assistants) appear to be having a ball. Pic utilizes a lurid palette of colors -- acid greens flaming fuchsias and eye-popping purples -- to create a look of comfy suburbia on acid. Almost headache-inducing effect is achieved through a diabolical pact between Michael Howells cluttered production design Nic Edes gloriously over-the-top costumes and special grading of Henry Brahams lensing. Use of special and visual f/x is restrained compared with most family films nowadays and deployed mostly to make Nanny McPhees warts disappear and in one of the most winning sequences make a donkey dressed as a lady dance.
