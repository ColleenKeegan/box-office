Appalled by sleek-suited Sam Neills cynical control of the market in farmed human blood renegade haematologist Ethan Hawke joins forces with the human resistance headed by the Elvis-quoting crossbow-wielding Willem Dafoe. Theres an emotional angle too Neills estranged daughter has gone Awol after refusing to be turned while Hawkes boneheaded brother is a gung-ho hunter of humans. The resistance are seeking a cure for vampirism but the avaricious Neill is more interested in developing a lucrative synthetic blood substitute. Sadly like the sun-fearing vampires the films characters dont get out much for long stretches theyre trapped in over-designed interiors spouting dull expository dialogue. Daybreakers is a marked improvement on the Spierigs 2003 debut Undead but its pulse is decidedly erratic.

Not a horror film but a slightly gory action film with a fantastic aesthetic. Im not sure what the Time Out reviewer means by cheap production values - it looked slick enough to me. What it didnt have was real emotional depth possibly because not enough time is spent developing some of the characters. There were plenty of twists but they werent all that twisty. I also feel that films like this where vampires are ten-a-penny kind of cheapen the vampire genre - vampires are supposed to be dark lost souls possessed of a monstrous evil. In too many films like this they are just Joe from down the block (until they run short on blood at least) or at worst a cynical businessman. Making their condition curable by a (relatively) straightforward mundane process cheapens them further. However this film does represent an interesting comment on the human condition - given the choice of immortality as a predator or a limited life-span as prey in the absence of clear religious convictions how many people would accept or even eagerly seek out undeath? I dont think theres enough in this film for a great sequal (I could always be proven wrong) but it does make me wonder - how many ""people"" would go for the cure? ...

Robert Cargill 01/06/2010 Get ready for a killer January. In what has historically been reserved and used as a cinematic dump month for pre-packaged failures needing an excuse to bomb (you know other than the fact that theyre terrible) comes a series of delightful treats. Studios seeing the success of solid genre films in the month and a half-long wasteland between the holidays and Valentines Day have loaded up this months schedule with something few have ever offered in January films they actually have faith in. First up is the dark science fiction horror film Daybreakers. Its written and directed by twin brothers Michael and Peter Spierig (aka the Spierig Brothers) the guys who several years ago took half a million dollars and a couple of computers and made the fun low-budget zombie thriller Undead. While Lionsgate purchased Undead and let it sit on the shelf for nearly two years it was a fateful DGA screening that convinced the studios to greenlight the zombie films we now credit with starting the zombie craze of the 00s. Not quite as funny as Shaun of the Dead nor as scary as Dawn of the Dead audiences generally scoffed at what they saw as an imitator rather than the precursor that reignited the craze altogether (Undead was completed and screened over a year before Shaun saw release and a year and a half before Dawn). Undeterred the Spierigs began work on their next film Daybreakers. Daybreakers is the story of a world overrun by vampires. They spread like a virus changing humanity into bloodthirsty vicious monsters that changed some and drank the rest. But as everything settled down and being a vampire became the norm humanity found a way to make their new existence work for them. That is until they ran into a problem they were running out of food. Unfortunately for the vampires starvation doesnt lead to death -- it leads to further dehumanization turning men into raving violent bat monsters that will kill anyone and anything for a single drop of blood. And with widespread blood shortages looming on the horizon the vampires thirst far outpacing the human ability to breed -- corporations have turned to trying to make a blood substitute. Ethan Hawke plays the dedicated lab rat trying to find a way to save vampirism from itself but just when he thinks he is close he inadvertently discovers what might be a cure. Trouble is many people have become accustomed to the immortality that being a vampire grants and dont like the idea of going back to being human. So Hawke must forge an uneasy alliance with an underground group of humans who may or may not be able to help. Heavily inspired by the work of John Carpenter the Spierigs set out to make more than just a film they wanted to make a sci-fi horror world that felt much larger than their low budget allowed. They were very successful. Daybreakers is the pinnacle of fun modern sci-fi horror actioners. Supported by a killer cast including Sam Neill and Willem Dafoe (in his seventh movie of the last year) the film creates a lush dark universe in which the vampires won humans lost and now the world just might come to an end in a bloody orgy of self-destruction quite literally tearing itself apart. Beautifully shot and masterfully crafted it hits all the right notes delivering what can best be described as a fun experience that doesnt for a second cheat your brain out of the ride. This isnt a ""shut your brain off"" action film. On the contrary it is a great piece of speculative fiction with a lot to say about human nature and our disregard for the limits of our resources. All while rocking your face off with taut pacing incredible action and dark pathos. Once again the Spierigs took a limited budget and crafted many of the visual shots themselves at home on their computers though you would never know it from the quality you see on screen. These brothers are masters of low-budget genre direction and digital SFX. In the true spirit of indie genre filmmaking they let their story and actors carry along the plot but supplement it with just the right amount of visual odyssey to transport you to a world youve never before quite imagined. There is nothing to complain about here. Nothing. Solid all the way through Daybreakers delivers again and again on the scares thrills and chills. This is how you open up a new year with one of my favorite films from the festival circuit last year -- and actually one of my very favorite films of the year period -- and I eagerly await my chance to see it again on the big screen this weekend.

Humans are endangered and theyre to blame; most of their own ranks went vampire for immortality. And why not? It was a peaceful coup--more willing than not--thats allowed everyone to own slick modern furniture drive cars with a killer dark tint and settle into a permanent life thats as bourgeoisie as our own with blood imbibed from coffee shops not siphoned from thrashing prey. Like ants milking aphids Ethan Hawke and his money-making hematologists drain the last captured humans for organic AB+ and then balance out their guilt by going the vampire equivalent of pescetarian. But the bloods running out and filmmakers and brothers Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig are interested in societal collapse--that is when theyre not more interested in the super cool way their vampires explode when stabbed. Daybreakers is a B-picture with A-list drama pretensions but it just cant resist juicing itself with shrieking sound design and thick wet viscera. Hawke sees this as a serious allegory but as Elvis the leader of the rebel human resistance Dafoe cant resist winking at the audience and we wink back. The one upside is the flicks awareness that vampires arent really bad asses; their sun terror and limited diet make them as fragile as the orchids Hawke mists in his apartment. If accepting their weakness can kill off this endless vampire fad then go see this stat. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Its nuts out there"" exclaims a character in ""Daybreakers."" Well yes Ten years in the future vampires rule the world and the few remaining humans are captives of the state who are literally being bled dry. The scenario is far-fetched. Given that tax revenue is the lifeblood of the state who seriously believes itll take 10 years for this to happen? Ethan Hawke plays a vampire named (really?) Edward hence a member of the ruling class (yellowy contact lenses and fangs are issued to all). But because survivors guilt is to todays sci-fi flicks what the Red Scare was to those of the 50s he feels really bad about the situation and even helps humans on the run. Like the corporation he works for he has no heartbeat yet is immortal. Eds boss (Sam Neill) at this slave-blood farm urges Edward a hematologist to come up with a marketable blood substitute and quick. A shortage of humans has led to a shortage of blood which working-class vamps enjoy drinking in their coffee and which the swells savor in expensive wine glasses. Riots are breaking out as blood is running out. There must be a noble band of raggedy holdouts fighting the system but did its leader (Willem Dafoe) really need to be named Elvis and even to quote the bard of Tupelo in a profound moment of insight about the relationship between darkness and sunlight? Gloomy Edward is prone to issuing depressed-collegian statements such as ""Im dead already"" but Elvis is meant to cast a vibe of anarchist fun like Woody Harrelson in ""Zombieland."" Problem Hes Willem Dafoe. Mr. Anguish. Not that even Harrelson could have gotten big laughs with lines like ""Were the folks with the crossbows."" The movie written and directed by (blood?) brothers Peter and Michael Spierig is possibly the least sexy vampire flick ever to crawl out of the crypt (it never occurs to anyone that biting someones neck is kinda intimate; the act is strictly utilitarian) but its unusually detailed in its imagining. The Spierigs have gone deeply into working out how a vampire-run world might operate. For instance since vampires cant encounter daylight cars have blacked-out windows and are navigated via video monitors. Such details are fun but theyre still just details and theyre all there is to the movie. Even in the final 10 minutes were still in how-it-all-works mode with new revelations about human-vampire interaction. The point to the movie is gore and allegory. For the lowbrow the thrill is a level of fleshy explosiveness reminiscent of David Cronenbergs ""Scanners."" No one dies quietly; he must either detonate like Hiroshima or burst into juicy red chunks of viscera. For the discerning the movie seasons the red meat with little flakes of symbolism. You may compare the dwindling blood supply to Earths oil reserves a mass execution to the Holocaust. You may even consider the movie to have interesting thoughts about free will. But if not itll only be a few seconds until someone gets his head gnawed off.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 07 2010 1143AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Daybreakers Directed and written by Peter and Michael Spierig Starring Ethan Hawke Willem Dafoe Claudia Karvan Classification 18A Ever since we pronounced our planet in peril the apocalyptic mills have been working around-the-clock shifts on the big screen. There of course vampires are the new star employees. With their rep for sucking the life out of things the toothy ones are an obviously apt metaphor in a time when both ecology and economy appear to be drying up. Better yet their new relevance does nothing to diminish their old virtues. Vampires have always been sexy their every bite a ravishing act; theyve often been conflicted simultaneously disdainful and envious of our sun-dappled mortality; and drinking deeply theyre a model of religious observance never missing their rite of communion. Attractive zealous fond of sex and violence allegorically au courant - no wonder todays scribes are so fond of putting them on the payroll. Directed by Peter and Michael Speirig Daybreakers stars Ethan Hawke Sam Neill and Willem Dafoe. Daybreakers works another late shift at this genre factory and turns in a pretty solid effort. Set in a future that no longer seems all that distant just 2019 the premise kicks in with efficient ease. Courtesy of some unnamed plague most of us are vampires now although not too noticeably. Beyond growing a little long in the incisors developing an amber cast to the eyes turning into night-owls and preferring our Starbucks lattes with a shot of Bloody Mary we look and behave about the same as rapaciously civilized as ever. Problem is Mary and her fellow humans have been farmed to near-extinction. In short our energy supply is imperilled and the scientists at the big bad corporation are having scant luck coming up with a ""blood substitute."" Chief among them is Ed Dalton (Ethan Hawke) whos definitely one of those conflicted vampires. He sips only from the lower animals and only sparingly; indeed confronted by a band of rogue humans (led by Willem Dafoe and Claudia Karvan) our guy instantly befriends them and longs to rejoin them to feel that vibrant pulse again. To that end he plays hide-and-seek with the sun treating solar power like the paddles on a defibrillator hoping to kick-start his lonely heart. Naturally the corporations CEO (Sam Neill) takes a dim view of Eds sentimental urges. Being the sort of fellow who would serve up his own daughter as a midnight snack he can be safely defined as the villain of the piece. But not the menace. In fact since the vampires here act much like humans and the humans simply act distraught the allegory is well-served but the horror isnt. Where exactly is the scary stuff? Well credit the Spierig brothers co-directors Peter and Michael with a nifty creation known as ""the subsiders"" a breed of unhealthy vampires who given the blood shortage have taken to feeding on each other with unsightly results - a volcanic skin condition followed by the sprouting of bat wings punctuated by a messy tendency (whenever the movie calls for action) of exploding all over the screen like a burst pimple. Such calls-to-action occur at the usual formulaic intervals and to these amber eyes are the least compelling parts of the flick. More engaging are the brothers playful additions to the oeuvre  little narrative fillips that arise logically from the premise. Like the vampirically rich bringing up from their cellars an excellent bottle of red popped and poured and savoured with a satisfied smile. Or like the way cigarettes are back in vogue now that death has lost its sting. Or how the auto industry has catered to the majority building cars that are essentially Ray-Bans on wheels allowing their light-sensitive drivers to brave the daytime hours. And while the sex quotient is relatively low its still accounted for Taking pity on Eds self-imposed celibacy a lovely human pricks her finger and extends him a nourishing taste. Shy but no fool he honours her offer. As for any deeper meaning forget it The symbolism is about as subtle as a fang to the neck. Really Daybreakers is more fun than foreboding; its fright-lite yet thats par for the bloody course in these busy apocalyptic days. The cinematic mills may be grinding out their endgames but no need for worry. Its still your basic entertainment factory where even oblivion goes down a treat.

Comments (2) Daybreakers Recommended Video 2010 Just when it seemed as if the vampire narrative had degenerated into terminal suckitude along comes this gleefully gory little gem. Its 2019 and vampires are now the dominant species but theyve greedily hunted humans to the point of extinction. Ethan Hawke stars as a bleeding-heart vampire hematologist striving to solve the peak plasma problem and save the humans with a blood substitute; Sam Neill is his malignant corporate overlord who knows there will always be an upscale market for the real thing. On the brink of a laboratory breakthrough Hawke is recruited by leaders of the human underground (Willem Dafoe and Claudia Karva) who have their own scientific discovery to share. Writer-directors Michael and Peter Spierig equip this unpretentious low-budget high-functioning shocker with some sharp satirical teeth and Dafoe has a ball behind his Manson goatee. R 98 min.

Appalled by sleek-suited Sam Neills cynical control of the market in farmed human blood renegade haematologist Ethan Hawke joins forces with the human resistance headed by the Elvis-quoting crossbow-wielding Willem Dafoe. Theres an emotional angle too Neills estranged daughter has gone Awol after refusing to be turned while Hawkes boneheaded brother is a gung-ho hunter of humans. The resistance are seeking a cure for vampirism but the avaricious Neill is more interested in developing a lucrative synthetic blood substitute. Sadly like the sun-fearing vampires the films characters dont get out much for long stretches theyre trapped in over-designed interiors spouting dull expository dialogue. Daybreakers is a marked improvement on the Spierigs 2003 debut Undead but its pulse is decidedly erratic.

Not a horror film but a slightly gory action film with a fantastic aesthetic. Im not sure what the Time Out reviewer means by cheap production values - it looked slick enough to me. What it didnt have was real emotional depth possibly because not enough time is spent developing some of the characters. There were plenty of twists but they werent all that twisty. I also feel that films like this where vampires are ten-a-penny kind of cheapen the vampire genre - vampires are supposed to be dark lost souls possessed of a monstrous evil. In too many films like this they are just Joe from down the block (until they run short on blood at least) or at worst a cynical businessman. Making their condition curable by a (relatively) straightforward mundane process cheapens them further. However this film does represent an interesting comment on the human condition - given the choice of immortality as a predator or a limited life-span as prey in the absence of clear religious convictions how many people would accept or even eagerly seek out undeath? I dont think theres enough in this film for a great sequal (I could always be proven wrong) but it does make me wonder - how many ""people"" would go for the cure? ...

"Movie review Ethan Hawke feeds the vampire craze in forgettable Daybreakers washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments Daybreakers Movie review Ethan Hawke feeds the vampire craze in forgettable Daybreakers Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 8 2010 In keeping with the peoples mandate that no month shall go by without another vampire movie book or TV show the film ""Daybreakers"" has arrived in theaters. Its subject a vampire named Edward who refuses to drink human blood falls in love with a human and does battle with his own kind. Sound familiar? This StoryDaybreakers Vampires ascendantWatch Daybreakers trailerFind Daybreakers showtimes Twi-hards be warned. There is no teenage love triangle here. The only heartbreak comes when someone of the vampire persuasion gets stabbed in the chest with a wooden stake and explodes in a burst of flames. Which is often enough in this passingly funny moderately stylish and almost mind-numbingly gory horror film set in a world in which bloodsuckers are the majority and the few humans left are hunted and harvested for their blood. Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) is the abstemious hero a renegade vampire scientist whose lab is working furiously to formulate a synthetic substitute for human blood that will prevent his race from turning into ""subsiders."" Theyre the starving batlike zombies that have resulted from the worldwide blood shortage brought on by the fact that draining people of their life fluid tends not to be the most sustainable method of farming. Subsiders are very bad news. And theyre very very scary even to other vampires but especially to people watching this movie. One day Edward meets Audrey (Claudia Karvan) a pretty human fugitive he hides from the vampire police. Sensing his trustworthiness she introduces him to a recovered vampire called Elvis (Willem Dafoe looking particularly undead). You read that right Elvis is a recovered vampire. Apparently (though Elvis doesnt know exactly how) he has managed to cure himself of his vampirism. Something involving exposure to sunlight which normally causes vampires to incinerate but in his case has made him human again (hence the title). Making life difficult for Elvis and Audrey (and now Edward who has agreed to lend them his scientific know-how and act as vampire guinea pig in their research) is Charles Bromley (Sam Neill). Hes the coolly creepy vampire CEO whose company has a monopoly on human blood and who would rather see repeat customers than a cure. In one of the films wickedly funny touches vampire commuters are shown lining up for shots of the red stuff at a Starbucks-like blood bar. Vampire purists will also note that unlike ""Twilight"" the movies mythology respects most of the conventions of vampirology (wooden stakes sunlight). With its social allegory about oppression of the other ""Daybreakers"" may remind some of a poor mans ""Avatar"" or ""District 9"" (another splatter film with a message). But that reading goes only so far. In the end ""Daybreakers"" doesnt really want to make anyone think too hard. If that were to happen they might stop to wonder why all the human survivors out there hiding in fear of their lives dont just become garlic farmers and call it a day.  1/2 R. At area theaters.

And then you dont die"" mutters vampire Edward Dalton a blood researcher who may have neither reflection nor heartbeat but hes got a conscience gnawing away at him.Not getting enough nourishment from humans harvested to provide blood makes undead masters very unpleasant in fantasy set in the not-so-distant year of 2019.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Jan. 8 2010 Starring Ethan Hawke Sam Neill and Willem Dafoe. Written and directed by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig. 98 minutes. At major theatres. 18A ""Lifes a bitch. And then you dont die"" mutters vampire Edward Dalton a blood researcher who may have neither reflection nor heartbeat but hes got a conscience gnawing away at him.Its 2019 and a plague has left the world populated by amber-eyed undead masters who prey on the dwindling human population that provides the A-positive elixir that keeps them going.Article Continued BelowHumans who refused to join the vamps are enslaved to provide food. But while vampires are immortal - notice how many of them smoke and why not? - humans age and die. Not getting enough of the red stuff has consequences for immortals turning them into enraged screeching winged ""subsiders"" that look more like their bat cousins than anything vampire.Research hematologist Edward (Before Sunsets Ethan Hawke) is a reluctant vamp surviving on pig blood and refusing to touch the human stuff while working with a team of scientists toiling at a bio-corporation in a race to discover a blood substitute.The blood business boss Charles Bromley (a delightfully lupine Sam Neill) is a bloodsucker in more ways that one. He pays lip service to the need to perfect a fake blood supply in order to stop farming humans while covertly supporting a paramilitary force that rounds them up and brings them in to be used like milking cows.Australian twin brothers Michael and Peter Spierig have followed their cult 2003 hit Undead with an artful movie thats likely to propel them into the mainstream. While vampires have moved into the teen romance world with the Twilight series this is a very adult version of the mythology. With its Blade Runner-like vibe and clever script that explores every angle of how a vampire society would work Daybreakers has substance and smarts plus lots of visual treats for the fanboys - a mix to keep everybody happy.The Spierig brothers adhere to the vampire rulebook using it to create a flipped night-for-day existence for their vamps who must ensure they avoid the deadly rays of the sun. The local Starbucks serves a coffee-blood mix cars are outfitted with daylight driving cameras and sunlight shields and a public safety warning system alerts residents to the coming of dawn.A thread of the Third Reich weaves through the story as brother turns against brother and father against daughter all in the name of preserving one race by enslaving or eradicating another.Theres also a resistance a small band of humans determined to survive by outwitting their vampire overlords. Theyre led by Lionel ""Elvis"" Cormac (Willem Dafoe) a tough-talking Southern boy rebel who has a fondness for muscle cars barbecue and quoting the King.Hawke is solid as the tormented Edward who hates what he has become and is determined to restore mankinds dignity while blood boss Neill and Dafoes good ole boy Elvis provide the entertainment.Neill is delightfully evil savouring wine goblets filled with dark burgundy viscous blood licking his fangs with delight. Decked out in a velvet-collared suit jacket thats a nod to Tyrolean style hes as cold as a fish and twice as slippery. The blue-tinged world of the film helped by Christopher Gordons moody score makes Daybreakers as much a visual entertainment as a solid horror flick. It is a vampire movie after all and theres some substantial gore. But even when it strays into an over-the-top sensibility in a few scenes its done with such flair that even the most squeamish wont close their eyes.Related story Twin directors make switch from zombies to vampires The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Thursday January 7 2010 409 PM Title Daybreakers The fact that ""Daybreakers"" was filmed over two years ago cant detract from one haunting revelation This action-horror thrillers depiction of a world lousy with vampires has come true -- at least in pop culture.Writer-directors Michael and Peter Spierig couldnt have predicted a TV/movie landscape thirsting for twilight romances and true blood. But there are twists here and while inspiration eventually runs dry ""Daybreakers"" does add vamp-mobiles to the usual mythology.Those are the anti-sunlight cars the undead drive in 2019 10 years after a plague gives almost everyone red eyes and a fear of wooden stakes. Theres also a ghoul military force and baristas serving blood-spiked coffee except the hemoglobin drained from hunted humans is running low.Thats where vamp hematologist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) comes in with his Van Helsing trench coat. Edward hates his supernatural diet and is working on an ineffective blood substitute for his evil boss (Sam Neill) since ""infected"" blood turns vamps into man-bats.Edward finds a group of renegade humans led by sexy Audrey (Claudia Karvan) and raspy-voiced Elvis (Willem Dafoe) crossbow-wielding saviors with a cure and Edward defangs himself for the greater good.Despite the Spierig brothers punchy visual style and satiric tone ""Daybreakers"" eventually devolves though Dafoe and his Southern drawl goose things up and Hawke has a greasy romanticism. (It remains unclear if Edward Dalton would win a brood-off against ""Twilights"" Edward Cullen.)But all the mirror-world bits get tiresome and the Spierigs seem to lose interest in what theyve created a feeling thats infectious.

No were not talking Twilight or TVs True Blood. TRAILER Get a taste of Daybreakers In Daybreakers its 2019 and a global epidemic has overtaken the population. Within a decade of the viral outbreak only a handful of human stragglers are left. Human beings are an endangered species having been hunted down for their precious plasma. A worldwide blood shortage looms. Human refugees and blood-starved derelicts prey on everyone -- vampire human even themselves. The neediest are pushed to the margins of society. Those who refuse to become vampires must live as renegades. The plague conceit works well initially and there are clever touches such as cars equipped with a sunlight-obscuring ""daytime mode"" and warnings about encroaching UV rays. Everyone gulps down coffee laced with thick blood. But the film is essentially a zombie movie with hordes of disgusting monsters on the rampage devouring victims amid buckets of spurting blood. Think of it as a zombie movie with a thin veneer of vampire lore. Some intriguing social issues are raised. ""Subsiders"" prey on people out of a desperate need to be fed and are rounded up by the police and the army. A giant corporation greedily capitalizes on the need for blood. Thats where Ethan Hawke comes in. Hes Ed Dalton a scientist looking for a cure. He also is a reluctant vampire who subsists on animal blood. Ed encounters a trio of humans and helps them escape the military and his soldier brother (Michael Dorman). The dialogue is run of the mill but there are a few good lines especially those hurled by Willem Dafoe as Elvis a human turned vampire turned human. While sly comic touches liven up the predictable tale glamour is absent which is odd for a movie about the most seductive figures in literature. This is no Dracula or Underworld. Or even New Moon. There are no handsome men or stylish women among the undead. As with zombie movies there is plenty of stylized gore and an early scene offers a stomach-turning jolt. Daybreakers is entertaining though not quite up to the standards of 28 Days Later. It is a happy alternative to the tepid appeal of pre-teen vamps and werewolves. But why make a vampire movie lacking the allure of the enticing fiends? Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Daybreakers in his weekly video podcast ""At the Movies With Peter Travers."" As the Spierigs see the future -- its 2019 -- vampires have taken over the world. Hilariously theyre all a bunch of tie-and-suited corporate workslaves who commute at night and appreciate Starbucks for adding a few shots of blood to their daily caffeine fix. The plot coagulates when bossman Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) puts pressure on his employees to come up with a blood substitute (what hes never heard of Tru Blood?). Enter the hero of the piece a vampire named Edward (arent they all?). This Edward played with style and bruised grace by Hawke is a hematologist with such a sympathy for humans that hes also switched to drinking animal blood. When he meets Elvis (Willem Dafoe having a blast) a vampire who has managed -- Ill never tell how -- to become human again Edward believes hes found a cure. Get more news reviews and interviews from Peter Travers on The Travers Take. But is he too late? The shortage of blood (read oil or any metaphor you like) has resulted in mass panic. The have nots of this new society calledsubsiders have begun feeding on themselves and morphing into scary bat-likecreatures. The script has holes big enough to fall through but as Bromleysniffs a glass of real human blood like the finest Shiraz -- he likes the scent of fear in the nose -- or Elvis hums a few bars of the Kings immortal ""Burning Love"" before lifting his crossbow in battle Daybreakers brims over with fierce retro fun.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Ben Rothstein) Photo Ben Rothstein AP Review Daybreakers 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Daybreakers Action horror. Starring Ethan Hawke Willem Dafoe Michael Dorman and Sam Neill. Directed by Peter and Michael Spierig. (R. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The average human body holds approximately 1.5 gallons of blood. Unless youre someone in the film ""Daybreakers."" Then youre carrying closer to 47 gallons 46 of which will end up splattered on a wall. This film gets a lukewarm recommendation but that might have turned out differently if professional ethics allowed the consumption of a six-pack of Red Stripe beforehand. Some movies play better in a small screening room full of Fellini-loving critics and others are best enjoyed in a packed house of inebriated yahoos. ""Daybreakers"" is in the second category. As far as the plot goes its more of a progressive-rock concept album than a movie. The year is 2019 and the world population is 90 percent vampire who hunt the few human survivors for their ""Matrix""-y industrial blood farms. A sympathetic vampire hematologist played by Ethan Hawke runs across some human rebels which leads to increasing scenes of outlandishness. (The most unbelievable part of the film Its 10 years in the future and product placement contributor Chrysler is still in business.) In deference to any gorehounds out there lets begin with what the filmmakers did right -- Directors Michael and Peter Spierig know their limitations The Spierig brothers could have wasted money on nonessentials such as a single recognizable female actress. But that would have seriously cut into their fund for rubbery bat-people airborne severed heads and crossbows with exploding bolts. -- ""Daybreakers"" is funny If youre blessed with a sick sense of humor this movie will make you laugh. This is a particularly amazing feat because every actor in the cast seems to be taking this movie completely seriously. -- The vampires dont (excuse the pun) suck Sick and tired of vampires who do girly stuff like sparkle and put too much mousse in their hair and make solemn pledges not to kill anyone? ""Daybreakers"" is for you. Nobody falls in love with anybody in ""Daybreakers."" With that said lets not oversell this film. Hawke is half-assed throughout showing passion only when hes screaming like a little girl when something scary happens. The visuals have a dingy unfocused quality especially in the muddy visual-effects-enhanced backdrops. And some of the plot turns are awful. The vampire ""cure"" is so stupid youll want to walk out of the theater even if you normally like this kind of movie. Then again Willem Dafoe is in the cast so you already knew the film was going to be weird. ""Daybreakers"" gets a ""C+"" for effort but an ""A-"" for over-the-top carnage. -- Advisory This film contains nudity strong language and a lot of blood getting spilled on rich Corinthian leather.

So much for tradition. This week offers a couple of fine new movies--""Youth in Revolt"" an endearing coming-of-age comedy starring Michael Cera and a remarkable German-language drama by Michael Haneke plus a genre flick from a couple of brothers who thought that the last word about vampires hadnt been said. ENLARGE Michael Cera gets a touch from Portia Doubleday in Youth In Revolt. The Weinstein Company In one way only but a significant way Mr. Cera reminds me of Billie Holiday who achieved subtle marvels within a severely limited vocal range. His voice is breathy wistful and piping yet plaintive and emotive. His abstracted demeanor suggests an emotional range that is narrower still yet his inhibitions are translucent rather than opaque; directly behind them intelligence seethes and passion smolders. Its remarkable that such a singular young actor--hes only 21--should have found so many worthy vehicles (""Superbad"" ""Juno"" ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"") in such a short time but hes done it again as Nick Twisp the hero of ""Youth in Revolt"" which was directed with impressive flair by Miguel Arteta and adapted by Gustin Nash from the novels by C.D. Payne. Nick has intelligence and passion to burn but nowhere to burn it. He lives with his divorced mother and her scruffy boyfriend loves classic foreign films uses elevated language to confide his yearnings to a journal feigns sophistication with charming haplessness (a casual reference to that craggy icon of American poetry Bobby Frost) and lusts after a Lolita-like apparition named Sheeni Saunders who is played delightfully by Portia Doubleday. Her boyfriend Sheeni says writes ""futurist percussive poetry"" and Nick agrees ""He certainly seems to have a gift for smashing ungraceful words together and deeming it a poem."" From the moment Sheeni appears in Nicks life the plot turns on his frantic efforts to follow her to the ends of California if not the earth and to obey her taunting injunction to be bad. To that end Nick invents a mustachioed Belmondo-cool alter ego Francois Dillinger who sometimes teeters on the edge of silliness. The movie teeters too but never loses its comic poise. Inevitably Mr. Ceras new film will be compared to ""Juno."" Both benefit from his sweet-spirited drollery both revel in rich vocabularies. (I cant resist quoting one more of Nicks deadpan lines ""Like John Muir I enter the forest with nothing but my journal and a sense of wonder."") The comparison isnt a fair one given ""Juno""s dramatic complexity and Ellen Pages virtuosity. ""Youth in Revolt"" is basically an absurdist ramble but a terrifically likable ramble with several stretches of lively farce (an incendiary accident a faux suicide a nocturnal flight from a private-school dorm); beguiling spurts of animation; an eclectic score (including a Sinatra soundalike Brigitte Bardot and Jo Stafford singing ""My Romance"") and a supporting cast that includes Jean Smart Mary Kay Place Zach Galifianakis Steve Buscemi Justin Long Fred Willard Ray Liotta M. Emmet Walsh Adhir Kalyan Ari Graynor and Erik Knudsen. One more thought. If youve been looking for a film whose hero uses the subjunctive frequently and correctly ""Youth in Revolt"" is it. The White Ribbon ""The White Ribbon"" a severe and eerily beautiful German-language drama by Michael Haneke takes place in a village in northern Germany in the early part of the 20th Century. The village still quasifeudal in its social structure suffers a bizarre succession of violent events and for a while the story functions as a whodunit. Who strung a tripwire that brought down the doctors galloping horse and injured the doctor? Who set fire to a barn killed a canary named Peepsie beat the barons young son tortured the midwifes retarded child? Once the real subject emerges it proves to be both ambiguous and profound What was done to those who did it and how did it make them do what they did? ENLARGE Leonard Proxauf as the pastors son in The White Ribbon. Sony Pictures Classics If that sounds fashionably vague--or simply obscure--be assured that Mr. Hanekes film is accessible though its pace is deliberate and its affect muted. (""The White Ribbon"" which was shot by Christian Berger is also a study in the power of black-and-white images.) The narrator looking back on his days as the villages young schoolteacher and choirmaster evokes a pitiless microcosm of German life where the milk of human kindness runs icy and thin. The doctor far from doing no harm inflicts unspeakable psychic violence on the midwife who has long been his mistress and knows the dark secrets of his domestic life. The pastor seeks to purify his own children with beatings then rewards them with white ribbons to signify their supposed purification. (A spontaneous act of kindness by the pastors youngest son elicits nothing more than a cool thank you; whatever his father may have felt goes unexpressed.) The baron casually tyrannizes his beautiful wife who finally refuses to live in surroundings ""that are dominated by malice envy apathy and brutality."" Only the teacher remains immune to the villages disease a lethal cycle of punishment and retribution; only the teacher grew up elsewhere. Through his generous inquiring spirit we come to realize the probable identities of the evildoers. Beyond that were brought to understand that their evil has its roots in the prevailing emotional climate of anger repression and displaced rage. The sins of the fathers are endlessly visited on the sons and daughters and its not for need of a dramatic parenthesis that the film ends with the outbreak of World War I. The villages disease Mr. Haneke tells us is the German disease and the human disease as well. Daybreakers ENLARGE Ethan Hawke and Willem Dafoe take up arms in Daybreakers. Lionsgate The vampire franchise didnt lack for attention or support last year but the German filmmaker brothers Michael and Peter Spierig have come up with a new twist in ""Daybreakers."" (The film produced in Australia is in English.) The year is 2019 and vampires have taken over the world--they offered us a chance to assimilate but we refused. As the newly dominant species vamps hunt down humans and farm them like dairy cows for their blood. But theres a catch--a blood supply that has dwindled to the vanishing point. (A panhandlers sign says ""Need blood."") If vampirism is to survive a blood substitute must be found. Thats a clever idea as far as it goes and a pretext for some stylish action (George Liddle did the elegantly noirish production design) accompanied by several solid performances Sam Neill as the CEO of a pharmaceutical giant Ethan Hawke as a vampire hematologist with a conflicted soul Willem Dafoe as an ex-vamp who has managed to be born again human. Still other performances are pretty dreary (I wont name names since you wouldnt recognize them anyway) and the idea goes only so far--roughly halfway through the 98-minute running time--in sustaining narrative clarity. ""Daybreakers"" finally comes up with some comments on the predatory practices of Big Pharma but thats an awful comedown from the blood-rushing brilliance of the early scenes. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS The Good Girl (2002) ENLARGE Miguel Arteta directed this underappreciated piece of Americana from an original script by Mike White. Jennifer Aniston gives an austere impeccable performance as Justine Last an unhappy wife disconnected from herself and the dire consequences of her behavior. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent too as Holden Worther an amorous adolescent who has taken the first name of J.D. Salingers young hero. (Holden is a stock boy in the discount store where Justine works as a clerk.) Every character is drawn sharply yet never uncharitably. The cast includes Tim Blake Nelson John C. Reilly Deborah Rush and Zooey Deschanel. Cache (2005) ENLARGE Michael Hanekes mysterious thriller which stars Juliet Binoche and Daniel Auteuil finds profundity beneath deceptive surfaces. This demanding quietly breathtaking film in French with English subtitles presents us with one surface after another--videotapes on flat-tube TVs ambiguous expressions on affectless faces--only to reveal that what we think weve been seeing isnt whats there. ""Cache"" is at once a series of puzzles a mystery that only seems to be solved halfway through and very much like ""The White Ribbon"" a human drama with much to say about the consequences of arrogance and repression. Let the Right One In (2008) ENLARGE It has only been 14 months since I reviewed this stunning Swedish movie about a teenage vampire but memories are short and the marketplace is cluttered. The vampire in the form of a dark-eyed girl named Eli moves into a suburban apartment with a stone-faced man who looks to be her father. At first Eli has evil eyes for Oskar the boy next door; he looks like an angel and lives in a hell created by school bullies. But she falls in love in her fashion and becomes the boys protector. Tomas Alfredson directed from John Ajvide Lindqvists adaptation of his own novel. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"More decolletage than homage - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesCAPSULE MOVIE REVIEWS More decolletage than homageA purported women-in distress genre send-up from director Rick Jacobson instead seems to be just another in a long line of these same films.January 08 2010 From left Julia Voth Erin Cummings and America Olivo star. (Kevin Warn / Freestyle Releasing )The festival of green screen that is ""Bitch Slap"" is surely intended to be a fond tribute to any number of hot-women-in-peril movies. Think Zack Snyder meets Roger Corman. Meets Christopher Nolan. Seriously. But when it offers only scant humor (and costumes) and interminable girl-fighting isnt that actually just another entry in the genre? There is a plot for those who look beyond the belles and whistling but it has something to do with buried treasure and the CIA and other stuff like that in a structure borrowed from ""Memento"" so the less said the better. This movies raison dAatre bursts forth in close-up after close-up lovingly caressing the assets of its actresses. And they are appropriately cast as the three stupefyingly sexed-up conspirators/combatants/abrupt make-out session participants. There are moments of enjoyment -- the oh-so-gratuitous water fight the lusty sadism of the most unhinged of the three and did I mention the abrupt make-out session? Theres plenty not to enjoy as well including a surfeit of fistfights. The target audience must be that awfully precise niche that never tires of women punching each other. The film also suffers from the lack of ZoA<< Bell; its the latest film to underuse the most memorable aspect of Quentin Tarantinos ""Death Proof"" -- flinch and youll miss her but she does coordinate the stunts. Despite its obsession with dA(c)colletage ""Bitch Slap"" is surprisingly puritanical (much teasing no pleasing) substituting plentiful violence and a howlingly predictable ""shock"" ending for the payoff it promises. -- Michael OrdoA+-a ""Bitch Slap."" MPAA rating R for brutal violence strong sexual content and language throughout and brief drug use. Running time 1 hour 44 minutes. At the Landmark Nuart Theatre West L.A. Auto fixation in Daybreakers It cant be a good sign for a vampire movie when its most memorable trait is how desperate Chryslers product placement appears. Sans teen angst or coifs ""Daybreakers"" is set a decade after a vampire plague has swept the globe the remaining human population no more than rapidly dwindling food stock. To grab life by the horns in the daytime the well-heeled undead tool around in sunshield-bedecked Chryslers. Meanwhile a crusading hematologist played by Ethan Hawke searches for a blood substitute to save the vampires from starvation -- and humans from extinction. Riding to the possible rescue in a modified muscle car is Willem Dafoe as a lapsed vampire whose re-humanizing could mean a cure killing two bats with one stone. The corporate villains led by Sam Neill would rather cling to their upper-class status than address the problems. Hence some chasing some soul-searching some excellent cranial explosions and spontaneous combustions (vampires apparently have hellacious allergies to splinters). ""Daybreakers"" may be harboring a message under the eruptions of gore It depicts the exhaustion of resources by the powerful who are even more addicted to profits and cars than blood. And the ""cure"" for the curious can be rephrased as a Louis Brandeis commonplace for speaking political truths. Any higher intentions are brought crashing down by predictability wooden characters giggle-inducing attempts at scares (shrieking bats anyone?) and cinematography so gloomy it should be checked for serotonin deficiency. This isnt the film to relieve our collective vampire fatigue. But perhaps its nothing a spin in a brand-new Chrysler couldnt cure. -- Michael OrdoA+-a ""Daybreakers."" MPAA rating R for strong bloody violence language and brief nudity. Running time 1 hour 38 minutes. In general release. Worlds collide in Wonderful What happened to Matthew Broderick? Maybe the question and even its answer is now obvious but when and why did he go from the very picture of reedy goofy energetic youthfulness in films such as ""War Games"" and ""Ferris Buellers Day Off"" to the puffy downbeat and browbeaten exemplar of unhappiness and bitter ennui that he has been in pretty much everything since ""Election""? Is adulthood that dreary? Is there something else we should know? In ""Wonderful World"" Broderick plays Ben Singer a once moderately successful performer of childrens music who has retreated from the world becoming a self-styled self-hating curmudgeon. His ex-wife now lives in a huge mansion with her new husband and Singers teenage daughter rarely wants to see him. He works as a proofreader in a law office making a long-term career of a job most people use as a temporary landing pad. His only solace comes from smoking pot and playing chess with his Senegalese roommate Ibou (Michael Kenneth Williams). When Ibou goes into a diabetic coma Ben finds himself with a new roommate in Ibous sister ( Sanaa Lathan).1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLet the Right One In tackles vampires but is no TwilightMarch 8 2009The vampires with real biteOctober 21 200730 Days of Night is a bloody messOctober 19 2007Vampire film gives audience a foretasteOctober 15 2007A New Reason to Get Out of DodgeOctober 30 1998MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewFilmEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-capsules8-2010jan08,0,2678011.story",200,daybreakers15,daybreakers,latimes

Only 5 percent of the population is human - theyve been systematically captured and then sucked dry - and the efforts to come up with a synthetic alternative to keep the vampires going have not gone well.Just ask Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) a vampire hematologist with the global blood supplier Bromley Marks His latest concoction injected into the veins of a vampire volunteer at first appears to work. But a few quickening pulse rates later and the guys head is exploding in a monumental spray of ooze and slime. Needless to say Edwards boss Charles Bromley (Sam Neill with pointy canines) is not pleased.Shot in Australia by writing-and-directing twin brothers Michael and Peter Spierig Daybreakers is not one of those Twilight riffs on suppressed passion with handsome young bloodsuckers as protagonists. The world of Daybreakers is dark and fascistic. The ""subsiders"" - vampires gone bad for lack of nourishment - are a pustular zombielike menace.But wait There are still a few valiant humans out there willing to fight the good fight. And Willem Dafoe in 50s Fonzie couture happily slinging cornpone commentary in a Southern accent is one of them. Hes Lionel ""Elvis"" Cormac a car mechanic who has managed to survive the plague and who rides around in a Trans Am with his comrade Audrey (Claudia Karvan in a ""get me a Famke Janssen"" role). When Elvis and Audrey cross paths with Edward - a reluctant vampire at best - the seeds of a rebel plot are sown. So too is a possible ""cure"" that could turn the undead back into healthy sunlight-loving mortals - a cure that has something to do with large winery vats. (The Spierigs were probably downing large quantities of Aussie merlot during their script-writing sessions.)While the characters are B-movie thin the dialogue standard-issue and the CG and matte effects only passable at best its undeniable fun to behold the likes of serious thespians Hawke and Dafoe slumming around in this cheeseball stuff.Daybreakers could be viewed as a metaphor for some epic eco-disaster or for a world where the thirst for oil has brought apocalyptic consequences or where famine has turned people into raging mobs - but all that would necessitate taking the film far more seriously than Dafoe for one with his Southern-fried one-liners and rolled-up pant cuffs seems to be doing.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Throw a bulb of garlic right now and youll hit a vampire. But ""Daybreakers a long-gestating action-thriller that opens today seems to have made room to accommodate both vampire fatigue and those who cant seem to get enough. Just when you think popular culture has exhausted all the metaphorical and allegorical possibilities the film unifies all the usual tropes (bloodlust heliophobia fangs) into a complete science fiction whole.""Daybreakers which is written and directed by the twin brothers Michael and Peter Spierig has unexpected flashes of brilliance. Its been shot and staged with unusual patience. All the scenes hang together.The film is set in a kind of corporate totalitarian 2019. Fewer than 5 percent of humans remain after a plague has turned everyone else into a vampire species of all races classes and occupations. They look like us only clammier and even more prone to smoke. The remaining humans have refused to assimilate and alas have been turned into highly coveted blood machines. Blood is dripped into coffee sipped like wine and has the power to drive the average thirsty vampire batty.The story revolves around Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) a scientist vampire whose company has been looking for a blood substitute. For moral reasons Edward resists his natural taste for blood and finds an outlet for his conflictedness when he encounters an armed human resistance led by Willem Dafoe. Edward cant quite conquer the conundrum of fake blood but does happen upon a far more exciting biological discovery. Its an inventive twist (which I wont spoil) that gives the humans a witty scientific weapon and the movie a series of mounting kicks.The Spierigs previous film was a gnarly 2003 zombie action comedy called ""Undead. They appear to have spent the intervening years thoroughly thinking out this movies logistics. Technology has provided coping strategies for sunlight. The city for instance has a vast underground wing like say Montreal does for the winter. On a subway banner Uncle Sam recruits for a vampire army. A monster mutation of blood-starved vampires - called subsiders - looks like a cross between crackheads and Nosferatu. Theres a very good sequence in which a rabid subsider breaks into Edwards house where he and his trigger-happy soldier brother Frank (Michael Dorman) attempt to kill it.The action in that encounter is beautifully orchestrated. The subsider flaps his giant wings and hisses as it hangs from the ceiling and knocks the brothers around. The sequence isnt over-edited or gunked up with wild camerawork. It unfolds not only in real time but in real space. The filmmakers want you to savor the images theyve composed. That commitment to framing and choreography is a pleasure to watch.The Wachowski brothers brought a similar rousing thoroughness to the first ""Matrix movie and much of the second. Theirs was a sharper more complex universe (paid for I imagine by a larger budget). But the Spierigs deliver a lot less philosophical hokum and a lot more humor - and scenes set in the open air. They too appear to be going for a saga. Although Boys stopping right here would be no crime. Most of the loose ends - including a subplot involving Frank Edwards greedy vampire boss (Sam Neill) and the bosss young human daughter (Isabel Lucas) - are either tied up or gnawed off.On the other hand a sequel would give everyone a chance to improve their American accents which are all terrible. The Spierigs are German-born Australians and theyve filled the cast with their compatriots including Claudia Karvan whos Dafoes co-leader and the Carrie-Anne Moss of this operation. Lets just say that the filmmakers ear is not as impeccable as their eye.But what an eye In the latter going theres a shot of dozens of soldiers engaged in a cannibalistic borderline-homoerotic feeding frenzy. Its an image that comes as close to art as a work of science fiction has produced in ages. If a second installment has more of that then fine Hello franchise.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In the unnamed metropolis of Daybreakers downtown bustles at midnight but lies quiet at noon. Sunlight is a little harsh on its denizens who seem kind of on edge anyway and not just because of their yellow eyes and pointy teeth. Ten years into an outbreak of vampirism society has become a dark mirror of what it was before with one looming problem The blood farms have started to run dry. The coffee stands have signs boasting ""Still Serving 20% Blood."" But it looks like the signs will soon have to come down. Whats a hungry vampire supposed to do? Even more confounding whats a vampire with a conscience supposed to do? Ethan Hawke plays one such tortured creature a hematologist turned bloodsucker against his will now working to create a blood substitute for a many-tentacled corporation led by Sam Neill an executive whose concern for the future never stretches past the edges of his profit margins. The work to put it mildly isnt going well and the consequences of failure surround the city in the form of ""subsiders"" the feral violent creatures into which vampires evolve without blood. (Think Max Schreck in Nosferatu only less dapper.) After one particularly trying day Hawke runs into the human resistance an encounter that makes his loyalties even less sure. Written and directed with considerable visual flair by Australian siblings Peter and Michael Spierig (Undead) Daybreakers bursts with clever ideas and resonant concepts from the tiny video camera in Hawkes car that allows him to see himself without a mirror to the eerie parallels between their world of diminishing resources and ours which comes complete with a neglected underclass of our own. It begins well too balancing the black comedy of the vampire world with some unsettling well-staged thrills. But after a while Daybreakers settles into the lulling rhythms of too many horror movies as the characters ponder what to do in darkened rooms instead of doing much of anything. As the action diminishes the plot digs into a rut hobbling toward a climactic showdown that doesnt feel all that climactic. The Spierigs get a lot of points for inventiveness but their cleverly constructed uncomfortably familiar world makes a deeper impression than much of what happens within it.

From the scenes relative placement early in the story and the familiarity of its premise its clear the operation will fail in the most spectacular way possible. The setup goes back a lot further than ""Independence Day"" or ""The Thing"" (either version) but the writers-directors of this picture the German-born Australian-raised duo known as the Spierig Brothers toy with our expectations just so delaying the payoff like expert sadists who know how to hit and run.Like ""District 9"" another recent inventive what-if? splatterfest ""Daybreakers"" imagines a near future turned upside down by a single event. In 2019 a bat-borne vampire plague has reduced the human population by 95 percent and left the golden-eyed fedora-sporting vampires in charge. But the global blood supply (nice metaphor for our oil dependency) is running low. When the vampires go hungry they become ravenous batlike ""Class 4 blood-deprived"" citizens stalking the shadows and wreaking undead havoc.In this world commuters pay for shots of diluted human blood on the way to work knocking em back like espressos. Humans are hunted harvested and bled dry by the sinister drug company run by Neill whose smile suggests a vampire at a blood bank. (Wait He is a vampire at a blood bank)Hawkes character isnt sure where he belongs in this new ruling order; he has sworn off human blood to the disgust of soldier brother Frankie (Michael Dorman) and feels not quite vampire not quite his old self. A chance encounter with a group of renegade humans led by Audrey (Claudia Karvan)  -- the best of many Australian performers on view here -- leads Hawkes Edward Dalton to a breakthrough and a chance to become human again with the aid of a hot-rodding vampire-blasting survivalist played by Willem Dafoe. Peter and Michael Spierigs earlier campier horror outing the zombie picture known as ""Undead"" was even bloodier than this one. The movie-makers are after bigger game here and a subtler mixture of speculative nightmare and action film. Its too bad things sputter in the more conventional second half.While the Spierigs are clever genre practitioners their camera sense mainly sticks to the basics huge close-ups suddenly interrupted by another ""boo"" moment. With luck theyll discover more and better ways to energize their stories visually. And with luck Ethan Hawke will deliver a lead performance that makes fools of people like me who too often wonder Couldnt they get anyone besides Ethan Hawke?mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong bloody violence language and brief nudity)Cast Ethan Hawke (Edward Dalton); Willem Dafoe (Lionel ""Elvis"" Cormac); Claudia Karvan (Audrey Bennett); Michael Dorman (Frankie Dalton); Sam Neill (Charles Bromley) Credits Written and directed by Peter Spierig and Michael Spierig; produced by Sean Furst Bryan Furst and Chris Brown.

Daybreakers Directors Michael Spierig Peter Spierig. Cast Ethan Hawke Sam Neill Willem Dafoe. Rating Rated R for strong bloody violence language and brief nudity. RELATED Ethan Hawke Daybreakers and his day job Sexy female vampires Sexy male vampires Vampire movies Spotlight Ethan Hawke Of course this calls into question your perception of good guys and bad guys. Typically since Bram Stoker wrote ""Dracula"" vampires have occupied a curious middle ground in storytelling. Yes they kill people suck their blood rob them of their very humanity. When you put it like that . . . On the other hand theyre just so . . . cool. Michael and Peter Spierig who wrote and directed ""Daybreakers"" place their story in a world in the near future when whatever plague caused people to turn into vampires won out; there are few humans remaining and they hide so that they wont be used as the bottom rung on the food chain. But unlike ""I Am Legend"" which is the story of one mans quest for survival in a similar world ""Daybreakers"" is the story of the vampires trying to stay alive. With so few humans left the blood supply is dwindling. The trouble with the dwindling blood supply is besides starvation the transformation the vampires undergo when they try to feed on each other (or in extreme cases themselves). Then they become true monsters the stuff of nightmares. Just ask Edward (Ethan Hawke) who finds a neighbor in his house or at least what used to be a neighbor. Now hes a savage winged creature desperate for blood. You might feel sorry for the guy if he wasnt so intent on ripping Edwards head off. Edward is a researcher trying to come up with a suitable substitute for blood. He works for Charles Bromley (Sam Neill) who would of course love to corner the market on a working blood-type product. Oh and theyre both vampires. So is Edwards brother Frankie (Michael Dorman) a vampire soldier who hunts humans so that they can be captured and farmed for their blood (the contraption the vampires have rigged for storing and ""milking"" humans is haunting). Yet thanks to an encounter with a human (Claudia Karvan) who is part of an underground network of survivors trying to stay alive while working up a possible cure Edward now sides with the humans. Its an interesting film despite the wild overacting by Willem Dafoe as Elvis a human with a personal line on a cure who wields a crossbow (as well as a ridiculous Southern accent thats as scary as anything in the movie). Hawke is suitably moody and brooding as a man - a former man - tormented. Neill is goofily effective as the oily Bromley whose attention to the bottom line trumps . . . what? His humanity? He doesnt have any left to begin with. Dormans also good as a heartless sort who comes to realize the error of his ways. The Spierigs create a nicely eerie atmosphere one fueled on either side of the vampire equation by a desperate need for survival. ""Daybreakers"" isnt a great film but its a good one and in a market oddly lousy with vampire tales its an original. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

You could argue that Daybreakers takes the new commonality of vampires to its logical extreme. The movie is set in 2019 10 years after vampires have taken over the earth and established an undead society that looks a lot like the human one they wiped out. Yes theyve still got big incisors and golden eyes but they also stand on subway platforms in Willy Loman overcoats waiting glumly for the next train and in line at fast-food outlets that serve coffee and ""20 percent"" blood. That would be human blood and the reason for the scant percentage figure is that the world is fast running out of it. (Its a thin metaphor for our situation with oil.) Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke) a vampire hematologist works for a corporation that farms the blood of human cattle who hang naked and unconscious with syringes ? holstered into their necks. Portrayed by Hawke as a sulky silent renegade Edward lives in a cobalt blue modernist apartment that looks like it could be the vampire version of Mickey Rourkes lair in 9 1/2 Weeks (talk about crypts). He is working on a plan to create synthetic blood a crusade that would rescue the vampire world (and save a few humans too). The only thing that stands in the way is -- you guessed it -- bloodsucking corporate greed. The sibling writer-director team of Michael and Peter Spierig gather the promising elements of a socio-satirical horror movie. But when Edward joins a roving band of human renegades led by Willem Dafoe as a guy named Elvis Daybreakers turns ? into a ponderous apocalyptic chase film -- its like Children of Men with exploding-plasma shock effects. The best thing you can say about the movie is that it pours some very old blood into a new plastic bottle.

Last years sci-fi blockbusters took on apartheid (District 9) and the Indian Wars (Avatar) not a moment too soon; Daybreakers dials up resource scarcity class conflict the Military-Industrial Complex and big pharma. (Actual line ""It was never about a cure. Its about repeat business."") The rationed near-future of Daybreakers recalls Soylent Green--except everyone knows theyre eating people because almost everyones a vampire in 2019. Where the trailer ploddingly spelled out the horror-dystopia setup (""Imagine a world . . ."") Daybreakers opens on a cool obliquely shot dialogue-free prologue that shows life after the vampire plague--and how frictionless-slick co-directors Michael and Peter Spierig are. Unrest grows as drinkable blood from living humans now factory-farmed runs out. Ethan Hawke plays a hesitant bloodsipper a hematologist looking for a synthetic substitute who falls in with a band of free-range mortals whore working on a cure while organic farming. There are pleasures here The ""Subsiders"" degenerate starving cannibal Nosferatu are effectively awful; Sam Neill is hambone-wicked as a vulpine CEO. But wearisome ""Aint it cool?"" video-game splatter-violence is all thats memorable of the action while a (mixed) metaphorical subtext of conservationism cant save a text that squanders its actors.

Take the futuristic corporate malfeasance of ""The Matrix"" and the race to find the post-plague cure of ""28 Days Later"" add vampires and youve got ""Daybreakers"" the sophomore feature for twin Aussie writer-directors Michael and Peter Spierig (following cheeky 2003 zombie flick ""Undead""). The novel hook has nearly all humanity turned vamp with the mortal population -- and their valuable blood -- thus nearing extinction. However the script doesnt wring many surprises or much character involvement from the premise and the brothers helming while slick is short on scares action setpieces and humor. Lionsgate plans a January Stateside release for this Australia-U.S. co-production; prospects look decent but unspectacular in all markets. Its 2019 10 years after an infection began turning most folks into bloodsuckers and the holdouts into fugitives -- or comatose captives farmed for blood by Bromsley Marks Corp. The shortage of blood is causing worldwide panic as the undead populace starved for the vital fluid mutate into grotesque batlike ""subsiders."" CEO Charles Bromsleys (Sam Neill) chief hematologist is Edward (Ethan Hawke) whos working on an artificial blood substitute. While a vampire himself Edward is in sympathy with the humans helping a group of them elude capture after a car accident. As a result of this good deed Audrey (Claudia Karvan) introduces him to Lionel aka ""Elvis"" (Willem Dafoe) whos stumbled upon a possible cure that makes vampires mortal again. Unfortunately Edwards younger brother Frankie (Michael Dorman) a gung-ho loyalist to the human-hunting Vampire Army has trailed him to this meeting -- with reinforcements. The rest of the pic sees Edward Elvis and Audrey trying to keep one step ahead of their pursuers while experimenting with the (awfully simple) means by which this vampire world might become a healthy human one again. Predictably bottom-line-oriented corporate types dont want that to happen. This strand could be a useful metaphor for say global warming and environmental depletion -- as companies continue to despoil resources whose exhaustion could imperil planetary life itself. But ""Daybreakers"" doesnt evince much interest in exploiting its premise for sociopolitical commentary or even having fun with the way in which vampire life hasnt really changed much about everyday (or rather every-night) behavior. As a result it becomes a movie that inadvertently asks the question If you make vampires so ordinary that theyre no longer scary seductive or endowed with special powers whats the point in having them at all? Indeed despite its fantasy trappings -- vampire-eye contacts a cold steely blue black and gray ""Matrix""-y look etc. -- ""Daybreakers"" emerges as a competent but routine chase thriller that lacks attention-getting dialogue unique characters or memorable setpieces that might make it a genre keeper rather than a polished time-filler. Reflecting their uninspired material thesps deliver adequate clock-punching perfs though miscast Dafoes quipping yokel neednt be included in his resume. Production values are glossy; Christopher Gordons orchestral score takes matters seriously. Though shot in Australia the pic goes for a nonspecific setting and American accents.
