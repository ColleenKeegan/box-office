(Remember The Net which hinged on the contents of a floppy disk? Sandra Bullock runs to her computer Now shes furiously typing Now shes ... waiting for files to download?) Cell phones alone have all but ruined the suspense genre; most modern movies bend over backward finding ways to steer their heroes and heroines clear of 3G networks and Wi-Fi hot spots so that the high-wire plots can unfold uninterrupted by the amenities of modern life. So its refreshing that Source Code a brain-twisting action thriller from British director Duncan Jones (who made his feature debut with 2009s equally trippy Moon) not only revolves entirely around technology but also manages to make it genuinely gripping. Following a very North by Northwest credit sequence Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) a helicopter pilot stationed in Afghanistan wakes up on a train chugging along through the suburbs outside of Chicago. He has no memory of how he got there but hes traveling with a woman Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to know him but insists on calling him ""Sean."" He runs to the bathroom to check his reflection and a stranger stares back. Disoriented and panicked he looks for a way off the train. But then it explodes. Stevens jolts awake again in a grenade-shaped capsule locked into his seat. His only human connection is through a screen that broadcasts a live feed from a nondescript government office in which an agent named Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) monitors his every move and vital sign. Goodwin explains to Stevens that hes being used to gather important intel and that his job is to find the bomber on the train in the eight minutes before the explosion. Hes sent back to no avail but as he becomes increasingly agitated Goodwin placates him by feeding him more information. The terrorist attack took place earlier that morning but Stevens is the guinea pig in a highly classified experiment involving the ""source code"" a time-traveling technological network that allows a person to inhabit a carbon copy of past reality that has been saved in the brainwaves of another human being-in this case Sean Fentress a passenger on the train. Stevens as Sean must ID the bomber in order to prevent another larger-scale attack within a matter of hours. As Stevens revisits the train again and again searching for clues he becomes smitten with Christina even abandoning his mission at one point in an attempt to save her life (which Goodwin assures him is futile as shes already dead). And as Goodwin and her boss (Jeffrey Wright) become impatient Stevens begins to question why hes there and under what circumstances. The answers he finds are chilling. Ultimately Source Code makes good on its Hitchcockian opening sequence-it may pale in comparison to the master but its a fun puzzle-filled ride with excellent pacing and a mounting uneasiness that recalls the best episodes of The Twilight Zone. The Groundhog Day-meets-Speed structure is both playful and suspenseful and all of the actors are well cast. Of course its not a perfect movie and when it errs it pours. Ms. Monaghans Christina is a flimsy (albeit friendly) sketch of a person and its hard to believe that Stevens would fall for her so quickly-if at all. The bombers identity ends up being a major letdown (""Life is hell"" he tells Stevens cheerfully when asked for his motive) and the film ends in a burst of inexplicable illogical gooeyness that feels like a rom-com ending tacked haphazardly onto what had seemed to that point to be a pretty bleak thriller (just wait till you see what Jake Gyllenhaal really looks like outside the source code). Still the psychological payoffs outweigh any implausibilities. And whats the harm in logging off your network for a few hours to indulge in some good old-fashioned science fiction? ulamarcheobserver.com Source Code Running time 93 minutes Written by Ben Ripley Directed by Duncan Jones Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga Jeffrey Wright 3/4 Comment Filed under movie movie reviews Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2011/03/movie-review-timetraveling-isource-codei-is-a-fast-fun-thrill-ride/,200,sourcecode0,sourcecode,com/2011/03/movie-review-timetraveling-isource-codei-is-a-fast-fun-thrill-ride/
"Source Code Groundhog doomsday | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentSource Code Groundhog doomsdaySource Code is a sci-fi thriller that simply shouldnt work as well as it does.Strong performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan keeps Source Code from seeming preposterous.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 31 2011Source Code (out of 4)Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. Directed by Duncan Jones. 93 minutes. Opens April 1 at major theatres. PGSource Code is a sci-fi thriller that simply shouldnt work as well as it does.An almost risible collision of the bogus science and cranial confusion from Groundhog Day Inception and Avatar it also shares the themes of isolation and alienation found in Moon director Duncan Jones heralded debut. Article Continued BelowThe jumble of influences includes Woody Allens maddening Zelig in that you may find yourself as I did wishing for the movie to settle down and actually start. Source Code continually loops back to its opening scene where Jake Gyllenhaal is chatting up Michelle Monaghan on a Chicago commuter train in a scene meant to remind us of Strangers on a Train.Its more schlock than Hitchcock but heres where good casting and a little patience pay off.Gyllenhaal is U.S. army Capt. Colter Stevens a decorated helicopter pilot who awakens to find himself part of a science experiment. His mind is inside the body of an unknown man the guy riding the commuter train. Hes informed by a controlling voice (Vera Farmiga) that hes part of a top-secret program called ""Source Code"" allowing him to twist time space and DNA to assume another mans identity for the last eight minutes of that persons life. And these arent just any eight minutes. Thats how long Stevens has to figure out who planted a bomb on the train part one of a larger tragedy. The bomber also intends to kill millions of Chicagoans with a second more deadly strike. Stevens has to unmask and stop him. If at first our body-swapping hero doesnt succeed hes obliged to try try again and that includes reliving the blast that results from failed espionage attempts. Stevens isnt given much to go on about his fellow travellers.Could the bomber be Monaghans Christina the flirty brunette who seems to know him or at least wants to get to know him better? Perhaps the baddie is the sweaty businessman with the briefcase (Cas Anvar) who probably gets stopped a lot at airport checkpoints. Or maybe its the trying-too-hard comedian (Russell Peters) who isnt all that funny?Or maybe its none of the above. Check rinse repeat.The science of Source Code is sketchy to say the least. Jones evidently realizes this because he allows Jeffrey Wright as the Source Code project head to ham it up with a wacky professor turn straight out of Back to the Future. Hes actually more throwback than futurist referring to ""the War on Terror"" as if George W. Bush is still in power.Neither Jones nor screenwriter Ben Ripley (Species III) sweat the details of the data and in this case its a good thing.Why does a ""source code"" mind trip last eight minutes? Who cares?Better that Jones should concentrate on the performances and he gets three fine ones from Gyllenhaal Monaghan and Farmiga who invest a good deal of emotion into a farcical situation.If all else fails its a decent thriller at a brisk 93 minutes including all the repeats.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Jake Gyllenhaals new thriller reviewed. With optional spoilers. Slate Sign In Sign Up Jake Gyllenhaals new thriller reviewed. With optional spoilers. Jake Gyllenhaals new thriller reviewed. With optional spoilers. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 31 2011 612 PM Jakes on a Train Jake Gyllenhaal has eight minutes to prevent commuter-rail tragedy in Source Code. By John Swansburg After youve seen Source Code check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Jake Gyllenhaal in Source Code By my reckoning there are three categories of moviegoer who will enjoy Source Code (Summit Entertainment) the new thriller from director Duncan Jones. 1) People who were devoted to Quantum Leap the 1990s TV series starring a time-travelling Scott Bakula and a cigar-chomping Dean Stockwell from which Source Code more or less borrows its premise. 2) Train-in-distress connoisseurs who are sick of re-watching the special features on the Unstoppable Blu-ray. 3) People who saw Jones debut film the haunting science-fiction fable Moon (2009) and are inclined to cut this promising new director a little slack. John Swansburg John Swansburg is Slates deputy editor. I belong to the last category. (OK the last three categories.) Source Code lacks the eerie quiet and gallows humor of Moon and theres nothing here resembling Sam Rockwells bravura performance as a lonely lunar colonist. The new film has less Bradbury in its blood and more Bruckheimer There are adequately staged explosions a perfunctory romance between attractive young people (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan) and a not-entirely-surprising surprise ending. This is a movie thats out to win a weekend if only an early spring one. Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is a U.S. Army helicopter pilot who for reasons I cant reveal because I dont really understand them has been selected to take part in an experimental program run by a shadowy DARPA-esque wing of the military. A tetchy scientist named Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) and his more agreeable subordinate (Vera Farmiga) explain to Stevens that his mission is to thwart an imminent domestic terrorist attack. Someone has bombed a commuter train just outside of Chicago and the bomber is poised to strike again. Americas best hope--no offense Chicago Police Department--is to teleport Stevens into the recent past allowing him to inhabit the body and brain of one of the doomed commuters for precisely eight minutes. When those eight minutes are up the bomb goes off and Stevens is hurtled back to the present. If he hasnt found the bomber he has to go back to the train and do it all over again. Advertisement Confused? Thats the simple version. I skipped over the stuff about ""time reassignment"" and the fact that--according to the principles of quantum mechanics and parabolic calculus--the human brain functions like a light bulb plus the existence of a Dunkin Donuts franchise on the train. (I called Metra which operates Chicagos commuter-rail service The doughnut car sadly is pure science fiction.) As this pile-up of sci-fi tropes suggests Jones working from a script by the similarly inexperienced Ben Ripley has bitten off a bit more chocolate glazed than he can chew. Thats a shame because the movie doesnt need all the plot apparatuses that threaten to derail it. Though Source Code nods to Quantum Leap--Scott Bakula even makes a cameo providing the voice of Stevens unseen father--the movie it more closely resembles in both form and content is Groundhog Day. Jones wouldve been well-served to take a cue from Harold Ramis classic by dwelling less on the mechanics of his magical premise. Determining the identity of the bomber on a crowded train in a mere eight minutes is no easy feat and Capt. Stevens is thus forced to relive those eight minutes again and again until he gets them right a Phil Connors of the rails. The danger in such a setup is boring your audience with all the repetition but Jones carefully doles out the clues and steadily speeds up the pacing so that each iteration holds the viewers interest. I particularly enjoyed the trip in which Stevens slugs a commuter wearing a Bluetooth earpiece thinking hes the bomber--he isnt but that guy had a punch coming anyway.Its not just the repetition that evokes Groundhog Day. Like Bill Murrays weatherman Capt. Stevens has some demons that need exorcising. Years of combat in Afghanistan have left him ill-equipped to handle civilian life--hes hollowed-out angry and violent. But just as Connors time in Punxsutawney has a purgatorial effect so too do all those morning commutes allow Stevens to make moral as well as investigative progress. He comes to care not just about his mission but about the lives of his fellow commuters especially the life of a comely young woman named Christina. (Played by Monaghan who is only slightly less annoying than Andie MacDowell.) Its this emotional arc underlying the ticking-time-bomb plot that keeps the movie from succumbing to its flaws. And there are many. Farmiga is poorly served by the stilted dialogue (""This is Beleaguered Castle. Are you functional?"") and a uniform that looks more Delta Airlines than Delta Force. Jeffrey Wright treats his scenes as if they were screen tests for the role of mad scientist in some future untitled M. Night Shyamalan project. The plot particularly its last one-third dissolves into nonsense at the merest scrutiny. Still because we come to care about Stevens and not just the successful execution of his mission Source Code has a resonance that too many contemporary thrillers lack. Gyllenhaal invests Stevens with the simmering anger and grinning charm familiar to the genre but also with a real sense of vulnerability. Some unsolicited advice for Duncan Jones Your outlook as gleaned from your first two films is perfectly suited to making great science fiction. You have a healthy fear of power-hungry institutions tempered by faith in the basic goodness of individuals. Youre troubled by the unintended consequences that accompany scientific advance but reassuringly your men tend to have a leg up on the machines. As such your films are discomfiting without being dispiriting. Go back to the scale of Moon. Dont let plot contrivances and trailer-candy explosions get in the way of your characters. Bet you a doughnut it works. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2. Khizr M. Khans Address to the DNC Was His Own 3.

Special to Newsday + - ""Source Code"" is a techno-thriller film directed by British director Duncan Jones and starring Jake Gyllenhaal right Michelle Monaghan left Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright. It was released April 1 2011 by Vendome Pictures and Summit Entertainment. Photo Credit Jonathan Wenk advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An Army pilot finds himself sent over and over again to a train that was bombed hours ago in hopes of finding the culprit. BOTTOM LINE Forget the super-science and concentrate on the superb drama. CAST Jake Gyllenhaal Michele Monaghan Vera Farmiga Jeffrey Wright LENGTH 133 The tie-up-the-loose-ends coda of this science-fiction thriller is preposterous even by the super-science standards of the genre -- it makes ""The Matrix"" seem like Immanuel Kants ""Critique of Pure Reason."" But aside from a couple of niggling leftover questions none of that matters -- because within this movies make-believe parameters weve a thoroughly original imaginative and fast-flying tale in which the ""Groundhog Day"" aspects are secondary to a story of service honor and dedication. Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) of the 117th Airborne finds himself inexplicably in what may be a space capsule. From this womb with a view he meets Air Force Capt. Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) a face on a video screen. She grudgingly gives him bits of information as much as he can handle about this Project Source Code as does brusque head scientist Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright).

The upshot is theyre transporting his persona ""Quantum Leap""-like into the body of a history teacher on a doomed Chicago commuter train. A bomb destroyed it a couple hours ago and theres no changing the past. But if Stevens can find the bomb and ID the bomber itll help authorities stop the man before he makes good on his promise to follow up with a dirty bomb that could kill millions. Stevens has eight minutes each time. He gets blown up a lot. Director Duncan Jones (""Moon"") seem unsure whether Stevens is inside a computer simulation -- love interest Christina (Michelle Monaghan) at one point starts breaking up like a bad Internet transmission -- or whether hes being sent to alternate realities. A third possibility appears at the end. Yet exemplary performances by Gyllenhaal and Farmiga as duty-bound career officers and Wright as a good man with unseemly ambition elevate what could have been a techy sci-fi yarn into a drama about the ultimate sacrifice. VideoSource Code Back story Gyllenhaal loved making it weirder advertisement | advertise on newsday In ""Source Code"" Jake Gyllenhaals character Capt. Colter Stevens explores his emotions while trapped in a mysterious pod. The soldier is uncertain how he got there but follows instructions from a military communications officer (Vera Farmiga) over a video screen. Gyllenhaal found the pod set oddly stimulating. ""A lot of the time I was acting with myself"" he recalls. ""I didnt see Vera on the screen. So I was literally doing the kind of one-man show that a kid would do when they pick up an object and go Oh hi Mr. Cup how are you? "" Though it could have been mundane shooting the repetitive train sequences Gyllenhaal found it fascinating. Each sequence varies from the previous one because his character picks up knowledge from earlier events and acts upon them. "" Duncan would come up to me and say Make it weirder which in my case meant do something totally different and explore how far and outlandish it can go which is what I love"" recalls Gyllenhaal. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff The actor says Jones reminded him of Ang Lee who directed him in the Academy Award-nominated ""Brokeback Mountain."" ""Theyre both kind of quiet and they both allow their actors to do what they are going to do"" he says. -- Entertainment News Wire Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Dont squander it by thinking."" By Jonathan Wenk Summit Entertainment Michelle Monaghan and Jake Gyllenhaal try to stop a terrorist by traveling through time to prevent an attack. EnlargeClose By Jonathan Wenk Summit Entertainment Michelle Monaghan and Jake Gyllenhaal try to stop a terrorist by traveling through time to prevent an attack. Mashing up Groundhog Day with sci-fi thrillers like The Sixth Sense and TV series Quantum Leap this adrenaline-infused ""time reassignment"" tale also sprinkles in romance as well as a touching moment of redemption. Holes in logic get swept aside by the brisk pace and stimulating tale. And the premise -- a man who has to relive the same eight minutes to avert disaster -- is more engaging than it sounds. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the much-decorated Capt. Colter Stevens a helicopter pilot whose last mission was in Afghanistan. He inexplicably wakes up on a commuter train bound for Chicago. Befuddled he tries to gauge his surroundings while chatty passenger Christina (Michelle Monaghan) refers to him as Sean. His most disorienting moment comes when he looks in a bathroom mirror and sees another mans face staring back at him. It turns out our man is on a mission to locate a terrorist responsible for the imminent bombing of the train hes on. He receives orders via video from Officer Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) a mysterious but sympathetic military operative. Hes able to piece together his current state thanks to the overbearing exposition provided by Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) whos in charge of this military experiment. Essentially Rutledges scientific endeavors enable Colter to go back in time and cross over into another mans identity reliving his final minutes. Colter bounces in and out of both scenarios in an effort to find the bomber and ward off additional attacks. Its explained by some far-fetched pseudo-science about salvaged sensory experiences and human consciousness. Like we said dont ponder it too much. About the movie Source Code   out of fourStars Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga Jeffrey Wright Director Duncan Jones Distributor Summit Entertainment Rating PG-13 for some violence including disturbing images and for language Running time 1 hour 34 minutesOpens Friday nationwide Director Duncan Jones last film Moon which starred Sam Rockwell was more cerebral claustrophobic and unnerving. Source Code has a broader action sensibility and a more mainstream hero. Gyllenhaal conveys a palpable sense of disorientation in the beginning but segues somewhat too soon from confusion into action-hero mode slightly undermining his characters credibility. In the race against time he spends several precious minutes indulging in flirtatious repartee with Christina and lightly jokes around as he shuttles between worlds. Hes not given to introspection which is probably a good thing given the admonition against thinking while in Source Code state. Monaghan is sweetly cheery and Farmiga brings depth and compassion to a straightforward role. The films weakest point is its banal conclusion though it does raise the intriguing question of how one might choose to spend the last minutes of life.

Its another tale of a man isolated from his loved ones forced to wrestle with his past regrets and present limitations in order to preserve the future. But while that film was a pensive drama set against the stars this is a casually brainy and surprisingly thoughtful blockbuster effort set on Earth in which Jones works from a Ben Ripley screenplay that is ultimately as much about saving the day as seizing it. The last thing Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) knew he was piloting a Black Hawk helicopter in Afghanistan. Now hes aboard a Chicago commuter train seated opposite a woman (Michelle Monaghan) he doesnt know who sure seems to know him completely disoriented and wholly unprepared for an explosion to rock the train and kill everyone on board. Stevens then finds himself confined to a mysterious capsule elsewhere only being gradually told by cryptic handler Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) that he has been reassigned to the body of a stranger who died in the explosion and will be forced to endure the eight-minute scenario multiple times in an effort to locate the bomb and more importantly the bomber before he or she strikes again. The technology that permits such handicapped hindsight is the ""source code"" of the title invented by Dr. Rutledge (a growly Jeffrey Wright) to help the government investigate disasters and prevent new ones and this mission which Stevens finds himself thrust into forces him to adapt from a solider into a detective determined to solve not only the imminent mystery of the train bombing but also the puzzling circumstances under which hes become an unwitting victim to attack after attack after attack. Thanks in no small part to Paul Hirschs sharp editing and Chris Bacons rousing score the parallel mysteries unfold with a sense of precision and propulsion helping to navigate the viewer through a dense web of implications and complications that would threaten to sink the very story it serves. The most evident appeal of Ripleys Groundhog Day-meets-Speed scenario is the ticking-clock factor and the emotional toll that it takes on Gyllenhaals character. His war vet is at first scared then skeptical sarcastic saddened and sincere in the face of a seemingly vain and yet potentially disaster-averting investigation and as a director Jones seems to relish the challenge of finding fresh excitement with each repeated sequence capitalizing on the constant sense of paranoia and nigh perverse futility of it all. Any conventional sense of action-thriller pacing goes out the window as the stakes constantly mutate to span the lives of a few hundred innocent civilians then a few million before getting down to the individual sacrifice at hand. At different points in the film the notion of what would constitute a happy ending either within or without the realm of the ""source code"" changes but still carries an unavoidable moral cost and the sense of utilitarian function that weighs heavy on our hero echoes the quandary faced by Sam Rockwells Moon protagonist in that film. Gyllenhaal is nearly as good here as Rockwell was there delivering the right mixture of resolve and vulnerability to make the drama viable. Monaghan plays well enough off him to make their expedited romance viable. And together Jones and Ripley make sure that the sci-fi is just viable enough to hold the whole crackerjack package together when it threatens to come apart. Capt. Stevens may not get it right every time he tries but Jones himself is 2-for-2 in my book. The Blu-ray supplements are limited to two fairly informative features a commentary track by Jones Gyllenhaal and Ripley and the ""Access Source Code"" mode. The commentary elaborates on the projects evolution (originally the attack took place in New York with Stevens returning for 17 minutes at a time) technical specifics (train scenes were shot on film while ""outside"" scenes were shot on the RED camera) the isolated nature of the performances and the trios theories on the films ultimate logic. Gyllenhaals dry sense of humor in particular tends to bolster the discussion past its occasional lulls. The ""Access"" mode is akin to the ""Maximum Movie Mode"" available on select Warner Brothers Blu-rays although the insights offered herein have a tendency to overlap rather than playing in a strictly linear manner. Gushy cast and crew interviews expert insights and animated asides unfurl alongside pop-up trivia about other time-travel stories (yes even Kate amp; Leopold) and laughably specific minutia about the historical implementation of smoking bans and drivers licenses. Taken individually any of the Modes five threads (each of which can be individually activated or deactivated) would come across as meager supplemental material so perhaps this concurrent approach is for the best if strictly for multitaskers.

Jonathan Wenk/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Wenk/Summit Entertainment Source Code Director Duncan Jones Genre Science Fiction Running Time 94 minutes Rated PG-13 for some violence including disturbing images and for language With Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga Jeffrey Wright Watch Clips This Makes No Sense This Makes No Sense Credit Summit Entertainment Kiss Kiss Credit Summit Entertainment What Would You Do? What Would You Do? Credit Summit Entertainment A man. A space station. A possibly diabolical computer named GERTY. Thats all first-time director Duncan Jones needed to create the brainy science fiction of Moon a model of jury-rigged resourcefulness on an exceedingly modest budget. The man was a three-year contract worker his only job to send shipments of an energy source called helium-3 back to Earth. The space station was spare and lonely a rundown version of the antiseptic white spaces in movies like THX 1138. And GERTY a cold companion of the HAL 9000 school had allegiances to a mission more insistent than its masters wishes. Jones follow-up Source Code will draw many comparisons to Groundhog Day with its story of a military man who must relive the same eight minutes on a loop until he gets it right. But stripped down to its most basic components Source Code is essentially Moon revisited a man a capsule a program serving a higher purpose than the fate of its chief operator. Only this time Jones has more money and greater studio expectations behind him so what begins as another existential head trip that puts ideas before spectacle eventually morphs into something trite and compromised -- hard sci-fi gone soft. In the early going Source Code connects effectively with the disorientation of a soldier who doesnt know where he is or even who he is much less what his mission is supposed to be. Played by the puppy-eyed Jake Gyllenhaal the last thing he remembers is flying a helicopter in Afghanistan; now hes on a commuter train to Chicago sitting across from a friend he doesnt know and eight minutes away from being blown to smithereens. When he comes to after the explosion hes in a crude metal capsule taking orders from a woman on a monitor who wants to send him back to relive those eight minutes until he discovers the bombs location and the identity of its creator. Working from Ben Ripleys script Jones slowly brings the details of Gyllenhaals situation into focus. Though his real name is Capt. Colter Stevens Gyllenhaal spends the eight minutes on the train wired into the conscience of one of the bombing victims. The victims confused friend is Christina played by the ebullient Michelle Monaghan and the woman on the monitor is Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who acts as Colters guide through his extraordinarily stressful ordeal. Hes a man with a chance to save lives by identifying a terrorist before he kills again. But he is still stuck on a loop no matter how hard he himself tries to live past his allotted time. i Forced to relive that harrowing eight minutes over and over in the search for bomb and bomber Stevens falls in love with Christina (Michelle Monaghan) a passenger who dies each time in the explosion. Jonathan Wenk/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Jonathan Wenk/Summit Entertainment Forced to relive that harrowing eight minutes over and over in the search for bomb and bomber Stevens falls in love with Christina (Michelle Monaghan) a passenger who dies each time in the explosion. Jonathan Wenk/Summit Entertainment The more confusing Source Code remains the better it is. Jones and Ripley align the audience closely with their hero withholding revelations until he discovers them himself. His trauma has the greatest possible impact that way Not only is this man doomed to relive the same patch of time over and over again but every eight-minute cycle ends with an explosion that kills every passenger -- and that he cant stop. And it only gets worse as he gets to know Christina and learns more about the various commuters whose heads are otherwise buried in books and laptops. Yet as Colter starts to stray from his mission and find some way to alter his fate the rules that govern Source Code break down -- and the film breaks down with it. The difference between Bill Murrays situation in Groundhog Day and Gyllenhaals situation here is that the Groundhog Day curse is the universes way of telling a self-serving egotistical weatherman to become a better person. Source Code is a piece of science fiction and while the technology that sends Gyllenhaal back to the same eight minutes may be gimmicky and ludicrous the logic behind it needs to be consistent. The last 10 or 15 minutes of Source Code feel like bad studio notes followed to the letter with all that careful rigorous sci-fi world-building tossed out and replaced by another lame paean to the transcendent power of free will. (See also The Adjustment Bureau.) Based on its thrillingly fractured first half -- not to mention Moon in its entirety -- Jones seems much smarter than he allows the film to be in the end. It wriggles out of its own intriguing puzzle.

Jake Gyllenhaal Michell Monaghan Very Farmiga. At area theaters. As nice as Jake Gyllenhaal is to look at ""Source Code"" may have you missing the company of Punxsutawney Phil and weather-cad Phil Connors. Because Duncan Jones swiftly paced and engaging sci-fi thriller is a ""Groundhog Day"" for a post- 9/11 world. Gone are the laughs that come from a flawed hero having to repeat the day till he learns his lessons and gets it right. In their place Afghanistan war hero Capt. Colter Stevens wrestles anxiety suspicion and a timer that ticks ticks ticks as it nears yet another detonation. When Stevens wakes with a start on a Chicago-bound commuter train the woman across from him is a stranger. But Christina (Michelle Monaghan) acts as if she knows him. A visit to the bathroom reveals the problem. He is not the man he sees in the mirror. Stevens has been placed in this new body by a clandestine operation working to unravel an act of terror by sending him onto the train before the big kaboom. The movie written by Ben Ripley manages the two unfolding mysteries facing Stevens  Who among the passengers is the terrorist? Is it the complaining black man across the aisle? The Middle Eastern guy who bolts the train at a stop or the smart- mouth a few rows back? Or is it the white computer jockey working his keyboard feverishly?  And who -- or what -- has he become? Stevens learns this over time from handler Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga). For audience members willing to take what he finds out to heart the answer is resonant and sorrow-laden. ""Source Code"" is for those who want a little gray matter in their genre ride. Theres even a gentle love story. Each time Stevens wakes up on the doomed train he cares for Christina a little bit more.

Source Code is a sort of metaphysical Groundhog Day. By Peter Rainer Film critic April 1 2011 Save for later Saved Jake Gyllenhaal plays a commuter on a train thats doomed to explode in a terrorist attack in a film directed by Duncan Jones (Moon 2009). Gyllenhaals character relives the last moments of the train in an attempt to discover the bomber. Summit Entertainment          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In ""Source Code"" the new thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal ""Groundhog Day"" goes metaphysical. Some people I know will argue that ""Groundhog Day"" was already metaphysical. Perhaps but compared with ""Source Code"" its ""Caddyshack.""We first see Gyllenhaal waking up from a nap on a commuter train bound for Chicago. Although his character knows himself as Army Capt. Colter Stevens he is addressed as ""Sean"" by a young woman Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who appears to be his girlfriend. Confused he stands before the mens room mirror and sees another mans reflection. Then the train explodes killing everybody on board.Except apparently Colter whom we next see inside a cement-block privation cell. A video screen connects him to the big interrogatory faces of Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) military-scientific analysts who are utilizing Colter - who is either alive dead or ""dead"" - for a top-secret Army experiment in which he is made to repeatedly relive the last eight minutes in the life of the train commuter in order to uncover the bomber who has also threatened to detonate downtown Chicago. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? All this is accomplished through what Rutledge describes as a ""parabolic calculus"" in which a persons consciousness is integrated into the ""afterglow"" of another mans dead brain cells - or something like that. At one point spiky-tempered Rutledge tells Colter ""it would take weeks to explain."" I believe him. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? What it all boils down to is that we along with Colter are continually reliving the run-up to the bombing as he attempts each time to foil the plot and unmask the bomber. In doing so Colter grows increasingly attached to his train mates especially Christina. His rescue mission becomes personal.Director Duncan Jones is highly regarded for ""Moon"" a deep-think sci-fi fantasia that left me cold (maybe because it featured Sam Rockwell in multiple roles and one Rockwell is plenty for me). ""Source Code"" written by Ben Ripley is better if only because the ""Groundhog Day"" structure is innately compelling and because Gyllenhaal brings to it his ardent exuberance. You can believe Colter would go to extraordinary lengths to save his train mates even though hes not at all clear what portends. His perpetual races against the clock have a frantic pathos.There is a timely and primal appeal to the films notion of turning back the clock on a terrorist attack in order to foil it. ""Source Code"" is the most explicit of a series of movies over the past year or so featuring protagonists with altered consciousnesses in altered or alternate universes. Some of these films like ""The Adjustment Bureau"" or ""Limitless"" take place in settings that from a global terror standpoint are relatively benign. Others like ""Inception"" and to a greater degree ""Avatar"" are more keyed to the bellicosity of the moment. But all none more so than ""Source Code"" express a deep desire to escape the post-9/11 ""reality"" weve been handed and create another. Narcissistic jags posing as metaphysical conundrums these movies are saying that you can change the world by changing your brain. Not happy with the mind youve got? You can perform a bit of parabolic calculus and insert yours into anothers. Or swill a pill and reboot your own.Pulp movies often nakedly reflect the zeitgeist. In the 1950s films like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" were clear expressions of cold war anxieties. Now were experiencing a similar phenomenon. Years - months? - hence I expect there will be an avalanche of PhD theses focusing on these mumbo-jumbo mind-meld melodramas. In the meantime you can pick up your BA at the multiplex today.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Source Code Recommended Video Rated PG-13  93 minutes  2011 This hurtling high-concept thriller confirms director Duncan Jones (Moon) as the great white hope of cinematic sci-fi. After blacking out in Afghanistan a U.S. fighter pilot (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakes inside the body of another man on a Chicago commuter train and eight minutes later when a terrorist bomb rips the train apart he awakes again to find himself in a sort of control pod communicating by monitor with a crisp national security officer (Vera Farmiga). Whats happened is that the feds have recovered the brain of one of the bombing victims which retains its last eight minutes of sense memory and are sending the pilot back into those eight minutes again and again to track down the bomber. None of this makes any sense if you think about it but the idea is so much fun that thinking about it may be your last impulse. With Michelle Monaghan and Jeffrey Wright. By J.R.

"Source Code review Sci-fi movie is exciting but gets bogged down in science |       NJ.com comments Source Code review Sci-fi movie is exciting but gets bogged down in science Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 02 2011 at 208 AM updated April 02 2011 at 218 AM View/Post Comments Jonathan WenkJake Gyllenhaal gives an intense performance as a soldier on a strange mission in ""Source Code."" Thank ""Avatar"" for this -- or blame it. But lately science-fiction movies have been just as interested in inner space as outer space. James Cameron pushed the envelope a bit by letting a man use his brain to enter other life forms. ""Inception"" allowed people to enter mere dreams. Then ""Limitless"" set the mind free entirely. Forget rocket ships ray guns and robots. This is metaphysical fiction based as much in philosophy as effects. ""Source Code"" tries to push things a lot further. Its big idea -- and its a huge one -- is that our consciousness lingers after death and that by tuning in to that signal we can not only access the last eight minutes of someones life but actually live it while holding on to our own personality. Like many great ideas its been claimed by the Pentagon who want to see if it has any military use. And so theyre trying it out by parachuting Capt. Colter Stevens into the past and someone elses soon-to-be-ended life to see if he can avert a major terrorist attack. He cant. It happens anyway. But thats okay. Because the brass knows that since theyve found this particular victims frequency they can just keep tuning in to it. And sending the stressed-out captain into the past again. And again. And again until he finally gets it right. Theres a creepy twitchy ""Outer Limits"" feel to this and director Duncan Jones -- the terrific filmmaker behind the loony ""Moon"" and yes as hes tired of explaining David Bowies son Zowie -- keeps things moving quickly while still cramming in lots of flashy yet perfectly motivated effects. Jake Gyllenhaal is buzz-cut intense as the come-unstuck-in-time Stevens and Michelle Monaghan is all friendly doubtfulness as an unknowing fellow passenger on a bomb-laden train. As Gyllenhaals ""control"" back at the base Vera Farmiga plugs into her cool professional side. The problem with ""Source Code"" is the idea of ""Source Code."" Unless youre an actual scientist (and some great sci-fi writers were) its best to keep facts separate from fiction and theories a little vague. How exactly did those folks enter dreams in ""Inception?"" How did Christopher Reeve really go back into the past in ""Somewhere in Time?"" Who knows? Who cares? What happened once those things occurred was what you cared about. But ""Source Code"" tries to explain itself at length -- and thats a mistake. Because instead of providing answers it only raises more questions and internal contradictions -- until the ending which will probably send you out of the theater confused if not outright annoyed. Sci-fi that makes you use your head is one thing; sci-fi that gives you a headache is another. Jones is an interesting young filmmaker and he undoubtedly has a lot of great films ahead of him. But entertaining as this one can be its not nearly as smart as it looks -- or thinks. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Source Code (PG-13) Summit (93 min.) Directed by Duncan Jones. With Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga. Now playing in New Jersey.

Movie review Source Code Techno-thriller is Groundhog Day on a train Add to ... STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 01 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Source Code begins in full racing Hitchcock mode aerial shots of Chicago including vertiginous views down onto passing skyscrapers and every glance made ominous by shrieks from an alarmed string section. Once inside a speeding train aimed at the city we understand the distress. A passenger Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) snaps awake as his flirty seatmate Christina (Michelle Monaghan) calls him by another name. Stumbling into a rest room the distraught traveller finds a strangers face in the mirror. Movies Source Code The official trailer Moments later the train explodes and Stevens is pulled through fiery debris. Waking again in a drab capsule our hero is informed that the preceding experience amounts to a briefing on his latest assignment Terrorists are attacking Chicago. Soon Stevens will be returned to the death train sent back in time to a moment eight minutes before the bomb goes off. The Special Forces operator has precisely 480 seconds to foil a brewing insurrection. The latest from David Bowies filmmaker son Duncan Jones ( Moon) is a deceptively complex pleasure craft weighted down with so many plots its a wonder the whole thing moves with such grace and efficiency. A techno thriller with all the trimmings Source Code is loaded with ticking bombs and dastardly concealed villains. And the Hitchcock stuff off the top isnt just for show Stevens and Christina are a pre-arranged romance. His handlers insert him into the closest chromosome match on the train Christinas shiny new untried boyfriend. So the world thinks hes someone else. Thats pretty well adman Cary Grants dilemma when he bumps into Eva Marie Saint on a train to Chicago in North by Northwest. Like Hitchcocks great 1959 film Source Code is a romantic comedy disguised as a suspense thriller. It is also a thoughtful meditation on lunatic heroes. Way back in 1969 Bowie compared being a rock star with being a helpless astronaut (Major Tom) in Space Oddity (""Planet Earth is blue and theres nothing I can do."") When we meet Stevens hes a burnout case like Major Tom. Hes just back from Afghanistan ineffably sad ready for retirement. The plot then is twofold Can Colter Stevens save the world? And can love save Colter Stevens? The juxtaposition makes both storylines more intriguing. Michelle Monaghans clowning response to her boyfriends sudden histrionics lends the drama a giddy fizz. She also spares Gyllenhaal the dull task of charging about eyes narrowed like a proper hero for the entire film. Having a skeptical partner also keeps Gyllenhaal honest discouraging the actors propensity for frantic overplaying. The two leads have a light teasing rapport that nicely contrasts and sets up the films desperate race-against-the-clock storyline. Director Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley also deserve credit for expertly shuffling the plot. Stevens cant solve the bomber riddle in one try so must return to the exploding train again and again. Its a set-up that permits him to engage suspects at different angles to gather evidence while allowing a series of dates - a full-blown romance - with Christina. Source Code could use more compelling villains and secondary characters. But there is one stranger on the train who serves the films varied purposes. Canadian funny man Russell Peters plays a sour comic who is continuously put off by Stevenss meddlesome investigation. He also figures prominently and well in the films cleverly sprung ending.

(Wenk/Summit) Joe Neumaier Friday April 1 2011 400 AM Title Source Code With Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga. Scientists send a pilot back in time to stop an explosion. Director Duncan Jones. (133) PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.Is ""Source Code"" a cerebral drama that believes its a roller-coaster ride? Or is it an adventure flick with a headful of crazy ideas?The truth is its in a little gray zone in between. More important this is also the first film in a while to have a decent heart while quickening your pulse.That begins on a speeding train which is where Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself hurtling toward Chicago one morning with no idea where he is who the pretty girl (Michelle Monaghan) is with him or why he looks different in the mirror.Suddenly eight minutes later a bomb blows up the train.Yet after the explosion he immediately awakens in a dank testing module where Stevens -- a military pilot and Afghanistan veteran -- is informed by Capt. Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) that he has been recruited for a never-before-used secret program called Source Code.Invented to fight terrorism the program uses quantum physics and chemical synaptic-map mumbo jumbo to shuttle Stevens consciousness back in time (or something like that) and into the body of a soon-to-die male passenger.The catch? The process gives him only eight minutes to find the bomb and the suspect before a bigger catastrophe occurs.So back Stevens goes again and again and as the story plunks its ""Twelve Monkeys""-meets-""Groundhog Day"" scenario inside of a house of cards built by Rod Serling and M.C. Escher the truth emerges.To reveal anything else about this top-shelf B-movie would kill the fun but director Duncan Jones -- whose slow intriguing ""Moon"" had the opposite pacing as ""Source Code"" -- has a way with mind trips men in boxes and the potential for parallel lives.Jones and screenwriter Ben Ripley also reward attentive viewers with clues and references. They know their way around genre riffs Jeffrey Wrights a hoot as an almost-mad scientist Farmiga has a HAL-9000 lull to her voice and Chris Bacons music occasionally recalls the classic sci-fi scores of Jerry Goldsmith.Gyllenhaal and Monaghan pull off the human moments within this intricate mousetrap -- hes haunted shes sprightly -- and never get lost in the puzzle.Though it doesnt need its last twist ""Code"" clicks on several levels including the important one where action movies still have a brain.

Its what might jump out of the closet. The blood the gore and the noise of so many fright films miss the horrifying point Movie watchers are far more convinced instinctively that what we dont know will most assuredly hurt us. Watch a clip from Insidious about a family trying to stop evil spirits from trapping their comatose child. The Unknown--and its misshapen attendant Dread--are the chief assets of ""Insidious"" a creepfest that stars Rose Byrne (TVs ""Damages"") Patrick Wilson (""Little Children"") and Barbara Hershey (""Black Swan"") and thus has an immediate leg up on its more generic and possibly inbred cousins. It may be snobbish to say so it may be unfair to struggling actors but viewers naturally expect a higher grade of product from a better-known cast particularly in a genre where performers are often unfamiliar and their characters are inclined to say ""Ill be right back"" before being whisked away by whatever homicidal maniac is lurking around the corner. ""Insidious"" does very well by its cast and by its makers too James Wan directed the first ""Saw"" and has been associated with all six of its blood-soaked sequels; producers Oren Peli Steven Schneider and Jason Blum were behind the colossal ""Paranormal Activity."" When your combined franchises have grossed more than 600 million you dont have anything to prove exactly. Nevertheless ""Insidious"" establishes that these folks can make a film that operates on an entirely different level sans gore or obvious gimmicks. And make flesh crawl. ENLARGE Rose Byrne in Insidious. FilmDistrict Moments into the movie its clear that what separates this ghost story from standard-issue horror is sound The creaking the moaning and even the silences of the large but unremarkable home where Renai and Josh Lambert (Ms. Byrne and Mr. Wilson) move with their two young boys start working on the nerve endings immediately; Robert Crosss sound design is an entity all its own. The house fairly mutters with malevolent intent loudly enough that anyone with sense would up and move with or without the furniture. Which the Lamberts essentially do Despite residing in the kind of movie where characters often do the inexplicable in order to thrust themselves into the jaws of the supernatural they get the heck out though not until their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) has fallen into what seems to be a coma. Changing houses doesnt help though. Strange stuff continues. Dalton is diagnosed as being in something other than a coma. And his brother Foster (Andrew Astor) cant sleep. ""I dont like it"" Tucker says ""when Dalton walks around at night."" Uh-oh. Director Wan takes some chances providing such fleeting glimpses of the ghouls that plague the Lamberts that were not sure we see them either. This puts the viewer on tenterhooks imposing the kind of involuntary immobility that is a side effect only of the more psychologically disturbing fright films. ""Insidious"" is not flawless--it goes well over the top as it accelerates toward a conclusion. And it should be said that Renai seems a bit cavalier at times about the idea that her house is haunted although we like that she doesnt cower from the spirits crawling around her childrens bedrooms She confronts and pursues and acts the valiant mother. But she and Josh are stymied until his mom (Ms. Hershey) brings in an old friend named Elise (a terrific Lin Shaye) who has some experience with these ""parasites"" of the afterlife the type occupying the cupboards and shadows and corners of ceilings. Elise takes a wonderfully personal attitude toward erasing them--a vendetta of sorts tempered by a healthy respect for what they can do and what might happen along with the knowns unknowns and unknown unknowns of dealing with the seen and unseen. Which is not to say one should be afraid of ""Insidious."" Just dont go in alone. Watch a clip from Source Code starring Jake Gyllenhaal. Source Code Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens on a commuter train heading to Chicago and doesnt know where he is. He finds the delightful Christina (Michelle Monaghan) sitting across from him. A passing woman spills coffee on his shoe. The conductor asks for his ticket. Cranky commuters make comments. And then the train blows up. In the entertaining ""Source Code"" directed by Duncan Jones from an original and architecturally ambitious screenplay by Ben Ripley Colter doesnt know--and neither do we--that hes part of a highly classified military research project and has been sent into the immediate past to find out who bombed that train. The ""source code""--a kind of shorthand for computer shorthand--is given a breezy but satisfying enough explanation by its inventor (Jeffrey Wright) but what it does basically is provide Colter with an eight-minute window in a parallel reality to find the bomber and prevent what is expected to be a subsequent terrorist attack on Chicago itself. What Colter cant do is save anyone on that train including Christina--or the man whose body he inhabits each of the several times he goes back into that irrevocable past. ENLARGE Michelle Monaghan and Jake Gyllenhaal in Source Code. Summit Entertainment Putting across a premise as fantastical as this films requires top-flight acting as well as a kind of poker face and thats precisely what the movie delivers. While theres no shortage of humor in the film it has to take its conceit seriously enough for us to trail along behind but not too far behind What Colter is discovering along the way the viewer is discovering too and Mr. Gyllenhaal whose performances are usually constrained and internalized gets to freestyle At some point during his return trips to the train Colter decides no one there really exists and he can act as crazily as he needs if it means ferreting out the killer. He goes a bit off the rails in a manner of speaking. But Mr. Gyllenhaal makes Colter convincing in other smaller ways as well How would anyone act were he or she to awaken as Colter does in a totally unfamiliar place among people who recognize him but whom he doesnt know? Probably not with screaming hysterics. Probably with wariness and stealth which is what Mr. Gyllenhaal brings to Colter as he repeatedly returns to the train. What Jones and Ripley do wonderfully is avoid monotony by framing each time trip in a different way fast-forwarding through the extraneous and by having the Colter-Christina story inch forward in such a way that the romantic subplot becomes as intriguing as the plot. Mr. Gyllenhaal is superb Ms. Monaghan is adorable; Vera Farmiga as Colters ""handler"" back at the base is her usual expert self. But Mr. Wright proves once again that hes perhaps the most underrated screen actor in America making the scheming Dr. Rutledge simultaneously shy conniving misanthropic paranoid and malevolent. The proof may be in the adjectives. Watch a clip from In a Better World about two Danish families whose lives cross. In a Better World Winning the Oscar for best foreign-language film is a mixed blessing. As a marketing tool its intended to hook serious American film fans interested in ""the best movie in the world"" that wasnt made in English and implies intellectual gravity unconventional storytelling and refreshed perspectives. Those same serious American film fans however are well aware that Academy voters tend to reward sentimentality convention and lessons in morality that make them feel good about themselves. Also children. And a little sex never hurts. Foreign-film interests know all this too of course and since they are limited to one entry per country a lot of calculation goes into what gets submitted. Which brings us to Danish director Susanne Biers schematic ""In a Better World"" which might have been made with an Oscar in its crosshairs and whose basic message is that civilization is good and civilization has a cost. Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) is a doctor whose work with African refugees takes him far from his estranged wife Marianne (Trine Dyrholm) and son Elias (Markus Rygaard) who is being bullied at school--until the new kid Christian (William Johnk Nielsen) beats the perpetrator bloody with a bicycle pump and puts a knife to his throat for good measure. Christian isnt a hero as much as a font of undirected rage His mother has just died he blames his father (Ulrich Thomsen) hes been relocated from London to rural Denmark and likes to spend his afternoons sitting atop a local grain silo feet dangling tempting fate. ENLARGE Markus Rygaard and William Johnk Nielsen in In a Better World. Sony Pictures Classics ""In a Better World"" is decorated with some gorgeous photography both of Denmark and Africa; children in the latter are depicted as joyous despite the sadistic violence around them; children in Denmark are preoccupied with matters that bewilder the war-weary Anton who tries to teach the boys a lesson about the never-ending nature of revenge and retribution but to little effect. It doesnt help Ms. Biers message that most of the adults in the Danish side of the film are clueless about bullying and boys or seemingly human nature; it doesnt help either that Ms. Bier makes such obvious use of a metaphor as elephantine as an African civil war to make her points about humanity. ""In a Better World"" is a perfectly functional drama with decent performances lots of beautiful visuals music that would make a stack of pancakes swoon and a tidy enough ending for television. And you can see why it won an Oscar. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is away. DVD FOCUS The Haunting (1963) Adapted from Shirley Jacksons novel ""The Haunting of Hill House"" this is one of the great exemplars of cinematic dread a film that employs terror rather than horror to drill its audiences into their seats. Nothing overtly sinister dangerous or violent is ever on display but the sense of anxiety is palpable. Robert Wise directed from a screenplay by Nelson Gidding and Julie Harris stars as a lonely woman who accepts an invitation to participate in the investigation of a mansion reputed to be haunted and which little by little co-opts her sanity. Claire Bloom and Russ Tamblyn co-star. The Innocents (1961) With apologies to Merchant-Ivory this may be the best screen translation ever of a Henry James novel (""The Turn of the Screw"") a scary movie that relies almost entirely on half-light and implication. A young woman Miss Giddens (Deborah Kerr) assumes responsibility for two children who may be possessed by ghosts of their dead governess and her lover. Are the brother and sister in the grip of malevolent spirits? Or is Miss Giddens simply crazy? Directed by Jack Clayton and shot by the gifted cinematographer (and future fright-flick director) Freddie Francis ""The Innocents"" imparts an unnerving feeling of a cosmic distress. The Orphanage (2007) Produced by Mexican master of the grotesque Guillermo del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"") and directed by first-time feature maker Juan Antonio Bayona ""The Orphanage"" eschews the horror genres ubiquitous splatter-film aesthetic for a strategy of nervous incipient doom. The story A woman (Belen Rueda) returns to her childhood home converts it into an orphanage for disabled children has her son disappear and begins catching sight of a mysterious masked boy who seems a harbinger of yes evil. A masterful use of bumps in the night keep Mr. Bayonas audience on edge. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump New Sandy Hook Elementary School to Open Soon Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo Jonathan WENK A soldier assigned to prevent a terrorist attack repeatedly travels back in time to relive the same fateful eight minutes over and over again in director Duncan Jones ""Source Code"" a fun ride of a sci-fi thriller with terrific romantic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan. In ""Groundhog Day"" Bill Murray was given endless opportunities to warm up Andie MacDowell over the course of a single repeated day. Gyllenhaals Colter Stevens working with a shorter time frame not only tries to get the girl but save her and millions of other people from death -- while sussing out how he ended up with this job in the first place -- in Ben Ripleys devilishly clever script. ""Source Code"" is the sort of movie best enjoyed without prior knowledge -- and there are really very few movies whose secrets are actually worth keeping in this spoiler-phobic age. So feel free to stop reading now and head for your nearest theater. OK? I do have to get into some moderately spoiler-ish details here if you want to read a review that isnt pointlessly vague. One day Colter who last remembers flying a mission in Afghanistan suddenly finds himself on a commuter train headed toward Chicago. Christina (Monaghan) an attractive woman hes never met is chatting with him as if theyve known each other for a while. And when he looks in the restroom mirror Colter sees another mans face. He has the other mans ID in his wallet. After eight profoundly disorienting minutes theres a massive explosion that destroys the train. When Colter comes to hes in some sort of cramped environment somewhere with a mysterious officer named Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) giving him orders on a video screen. She tells Colter that hes part of an experimental program -- one he doesnt remember volunteering for -- that uses a ""source code"" to send subjects back to replay the last eight minutes of another persons life. The extremely reluctant Colters assignment is to keep repeating this loop until he finds a passenger on the train wholl get off before its destruction and is planning a much larger terrorist attack later that day. So back Colter travels in time repeatedly to search for the culprit on a train loaded with more red herrings than an Agatha Christie novel. But Christina proves a major distraction; before long our hero has fallen in love with her. Which is problematic since Goodwin repeatedly informs Colter that shes already dead and theres absolutely nothing he can do to change the past including saving her and the other passengers on the train. He needs to focus on the future and the millions of other still-living people in Chicago. Thats easier said than done. Colter is becoming increasingly obsessed about where he is and how he got into this situation -- slowly cajoling information out of Goodwin and the impatient scientist (Jeffrey Wright) running the project. The latter repeatedly warns Colter hes squandering the finite amount of time available to stop the big attack. Jones -- the director of ""Moon"" and the son of David Bowie -- handles this complex narrative with great assurance and gets warm compassionate performances out of Gyllenhaal and Monaghan that greatly enhance the movies dramatic credibility. This turns out to be crucial since the films sentimental ending isnt anywhere near as convincing as the other sections. But by that point I was so onboard with the stars and the premise that it didnt affect my enjoyment of ""Source Code."" I think youll like it too. lou.lumenicknypost.com.

He learns hes part of a government experiment called the ""Source Code"" a program that enables him to cross over into another mans identity in the last eight minutes of his life. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga Jeffrey Wright Russell Peters James A. Woods Michael Arden Cas Anvar Joe Cobden Neil Napier Director Duncan Jones Running time 134 Release Opened Apr 1 2011  Editorial Review Lets do the time warp again and againBy Ann HornadayFriday April 1 2011The nifty speculative thriller ""Source Code"" obeys one of the fundamental rules of Hollywood wherein amateurs borrow and professionals steal. In this case screenwriter Ben Ripley has filched from the best delivering a taut mostly well-crafted race against the clock that combines the time-loop conceit of ""Groundhog Day"" and the postwar paranoia of ""The Manchurian Candidate.""""The Groundhogian Candidate"" anyone?Jake Gyllenhaals Colter Stevens a decorated U.S. soldier recently deployed in Afghanistan doesnt play much solitaire in ""Source Code."" Then again he doesnt really have the time. The movie opens with Stevens jolting awake on a Chicago commuter train while his pretty seat mate (Michelle Monaghan) chatters happily away about quitting her job. Disoriented Stevens has no idea who this woman is or why hes on the train. A few minutes later a bomb goes off and hes sucked into yet another reality a cramped metallic capsule smelling strongly of hydraulic fluid.Whats going on? And whos that uniformed lady talking in Stevenss ear? That would be a dulcet-voiced but shadowy handler named Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) who with her boss (Jeffrey Wright) operates an experimental time-travel operation for the U.S. military. As ""Source Code"" unfolds in a series of cleverly assembled accordion pleats it all begins to make sense sort of as Stevens discovers hes on a mission with supernatural overtones but very real consequences.Adroitly directed by Duncan Jones (""Moon"") ""Source Code"" clicks along with swift crisp tension with Gyllenhaal delivering an assured lead performance as a man at once out of his depth and supremely self-assured. He joins a recent spate of ordinary men assuming extraordinary control over their own fates including Matt Damon in ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and Bradley Cooper in ""Limitless."" (Is this trend a wish-fulfillment response to collective anxiety in the face of overwhelming and uncertain economic and social times? Discuss)Indeed its the persuasive turns of all the cast members -- within an otherwise preposterous setup -- that allow filmgoers to surrender to the propulsive force of ""Source Code."" Monaghan and Farmiga are especially winning as the sympathetic women who coax Stevens along a path that while preordained he insists on twisting. The only misstep comes from Wright who lays the Poindexter nerdiness on a bit thick as a hard-hearted scientist.As for outright stumbles ""Source Code"" loses its footing at the end with a conclusion that strikes a discordantly mushy note after the carefully calibrated procedural that has gone before. But for the most part ""Source Code"" delivers on its promises with precision and care -- all thats missing is Punxsutawney Phil and a toast to world peace.Contains some violence including some disturbing images and profanity.

Photo Jonathan Wenk Summit Entertainment LLC. Source Code review a thriller - and poetry 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Source Code Science fiction. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal Vera Farmiga Michelle Monaghan and Jeffrey Wright. Directed by Duncan Jones. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A man wakes up on a train and has no idea how he got there. But the woman sitting across from him knows who he is and strikes up a conversation. She calls him by name - but its not his name. And when he goes into the bathroom to collect himself the face in the mirror isnt his own. This is the intriguing opening to ""Source Code"" a thriller that takes a science fiction premise and uses it not for the sake of splashy effects but as a doorway into the human soul. The story is simple but charged with feeling concerning a man trying to identify who committed a mass murder - so as to prevent an even greater disaster. Within five minutes the movie lays it all out for us The commuter train is not strictly speaking real. Earlier in the day it was destroyed in a terrorist attack. What were seeing instead is a kind of echo memory. In the world of ""Source Code"" science is able for a short time to tap into the consciousnesses of the victims so as to re-create the last eight minutes of their lives - and collectively to re-create everything that might have happened on that train. Related Stories Source Code Just that concept in itself has power. Its one thing to see people on a train. But to see those people and know that youre witnessing the last minutes of their lives gives everything they do significance and poignancy. Whats more knowing that what youre seeing isnt even real that this isnt time travel but just waves of memory creates a sympathetic awareness of the simplicity of human longing. This is what ""Source Code"" has going for it before anything even happens. This is before the frame has been filled in with a good story tense action huge stakes and touching and perceptive performances. Jake Gyllenhaal plays an Army pilot who has been recruited for a special assignment. His consciousness has been projected into the body of one of the victims so that he can look around find out who blew up the train and head off another terrorist attack about to take place in Washington. His superiors keep sending him back into the train to relive those eight minutes and most of ""Source Code"" consists of showing those return trips. Each return visit is a little bit different. Each one is equally urgent and frantic. Each presents a difficult situation There are hundreds of passengers. How do you identify the guilty party in just eight minutes? Like its protagonist ""Source Code"" gets a lot done in a short time and by the end of a concise and packed hour and a half theres a sense of having completed a full journey. Vera Farmiga as the officer conducting the experiment nicely calibrates a soldiers path from cold efficiency to humanity and Jeffrey Wright as the ambitious scientist behind the project creates a detailed portrait of a skewed soul. Meanwhile Michelle Monaghan as one of the unwitting victims of the tragedy is lovely and vivid. The notion of a mans falling in love with a dead womans shadow is a familiar motif in high art. Its no less potent in this crowd-pleasing picture. Director Duncan Jones touched on some of these themes - the manipulations of science and the power and persistence of emotion - in his first feature ""Moon"" but a weak screenplay resulted in a stagnant film. But here working with a superior screenplay by Ben Ripley he achieves a strange and winning amalgam a gripping action film that also works as poetry. The accuracy of the science must be left for someone else to gauge. But as an evocation of the grand desires of the spirit - and the painful distance between the simple things people search for and the things they actually find - ""Source Code"" is a true and eloquent expression. -- Advisory Disturbing violence.

Its just a few seconds of dazzling outdoor color perhaps artificially enriched in a tick-tock puzzler that mostly takes place in enclosed spaces but its a nice little metaphor too The geese are about to take off and sos the movie. We also have no idea the first time we see those geese how well well get to know them and how much affection well feel for them before the whole thing is over.That shot ends by locating a commuter train on its way to Chicago which is where an Air Force helicopter pilot named Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) wakes up disoriented unsure where he is or how he got there let alone why the pretty young woman sitting across from him (Michelle Monaghan) keeps calling him ""Sean."" By the time Stevens works out some basic facts about his situation including the startling discovery that the face he sees in the bathroom mirror isnt his own (although it matches the ID in his wallet which belongs to a high school teacher named Sean Fentress) a huge explosion rips through the train obliterating him and Monaghans character and a whole lot of other people. (Summit Entertainment has posted the first five minutes of ""Source Code"" on YouTube and its among the better teasers of recent memory.)When Stevens wakes up again hes upside down strapped into some kind of decrepit metal space capsule with an all-business female officer (its the ever-terrific Vera Farmiga working wonders with a role that could have been nothing) talking to him through a low-quality video connection apparently from a base code-named Beleaguered Castle. Shes able to use some ""Manchurian Candidate""-style tricks -- a sequence of playing cards a story containing code words -- to reorient him a little bit and urges him to go right back into the simulation or training exercise or whatever it is and try to find the bomb and the bomber. Waging an internal battle between military discipline and simple human confusion Stevens demands to be briefed Why cant he remember anything since his last mission over Afghanistan? Has he been evacuated to the United States? When can he call his dad? What and where is this creaky vessel that seems to be leaking hydraulic fluid?Eventually those questions will be answered but not here of course. Spoiler warning I wont go beyond the first set of plot revelations those widely available in the films publicity campaign. If youve avoided those and want to continue to do so please step away from the Internet sir. The double mystery in ""Source Code"" is deftly handled by Jones (who also made the intriguing sci-fi indie ""Moon"" and is pre-famous as the son of rock legend David Bowie) and screenwriter Ben Ripley who forge an interlocking double helix of discoveries as Stevens relives the train bombing ""Groundhog Day"" style over and over again. Despite warnings from Goodwin (thats Farmigas icy officer who does warm up a little) and her twitchy Strangelove-esque boss Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) Stevens begins to use his eight-minute sessions aboard the doomed train to learn what he can about his own fate as well as to sort through the clues and characters around him the grouchy stand-up comic the college student the older woman with the tote bag from a military hospital the douchey guy with the Bluetooth headset and the rest of them. You Might Also Like Stevens runs through his ""mission"" at least six times in fact -- not counting the ones that speed by in tiny fragments -- and each one is a little different. Not just because he pursues different threads of the story each time discovering where the bomb is planted or harassing a Middle Eastern-looking guy in a suit (innocent of course) or stealing a gun or making unauthorized phone calls to the Air Force but because he gets to know his role as Sean Fentress a little better and pays more attention to the winsome Christina (Monaghan) who has evidently been waiting a while for Sean to make his move. If the science behind whats going on in the super-secret time-travel and/or astral projection project at Beleaguered Castle is almost pure hokum theres just enough pop physics and more than enough real human psychology to lend this intriguing popcorn movie some depth.Jones keeps the plot mechanics whirring on at least three levels if not four (once you count Stevens-as-Seans burgeoning romance with Christina and Stevens subtly shifting video relationship with Goodwin) which may distract you from some of the films odder strengths and liabilities. Goodwin and Rutledge keep exhorting Stevens not to overthink his situation and they may as well be addressing the audience since Im not sure suspension of disbelief can cover all the logical and philosophical fallacies embedded into this ""Quantum Leap""-style yarn. Still I agree with them Thats not the point. Ingeniously Ripley and Jones withhold nearly all the canned characterization or ""relatable"" back-story material youd expect from a conventional Hollywood thriller. Everything we learn about Stevens and Christina and Goodwin by the end of the film comes from their actions not their words. That lends ""Source Code"" an elusive almost arty shimmer beneath its glossy action-movie surface. I suspect it will play well on repeat viewings despite (or possibly because of) its unsolvable plot koans. Gyllenhaal begins the movie playing Stevens as a clean controlled masculine Hitchcock-type hero engaged in an individual struggle against the cruel machineries of God. By the end of ""Source Code"" hes become a different kind of hero one who has stepped out of time for a moment and gotten a glimpse behind the curtain of existence a la I dont know Dave Bowman in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" or a Zen master or something. He has learned what we all already know but have trouble remembering that all we ever have is right now Someone spilling Coke on our shoe a girl to kiss on a train the sight and sound of geese taking off from water.

"Source Code Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Source CodeJake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghans commitment sell the sci-fi thrillers complicated plot.April 01 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Its the obvious thing to say but it cant be avoided ""Source Code"" is the science-fiction thriller version of ""Groundhog Day"" and that turns out to be not a bad thing at all. Crisply directed by Duncan Jones from a cleverly constructed Ben Ripley script ""Source Code"" doesnt have protagonist Jake Gyllenhaal repeat the same day ad infinitum the way Bill Murray did; no he has to relive a particular eight minutes over and over again. Not because he wants to but because wouldnt you know it large numbers of innocent lives are at stake. With a twisty mind-bending plot that frequently changes direction and occasionally overreaches ""Source Code"" wouldnt work at all without a cast with the determination and ability to really sell its story. With Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga and Jeffrey Wright in the key roles thats just what it has. Its Gyllenhaals character we encounter first as he wakes up groggy and haggard on a commuter train headed into Chicago after what looks to have been a troubled sleep. And that isnt the half of it. This character thinks hes Army Capt. Colter Stevens Afghan war veteran but Christina Warren (Monaghan) the woman seated opposite him on the train keeps calling him Sean. And when the captain looks into a mirror its not his own face he sees but Seans. Making things even more confusing after exactly eight minutes the train explodes and an even more disoriented Stevens inexplicably finds himself in a space capsule talking via video hookup to Capt. Colleen Goodwin (Farmiga) his military handler. Some confusion she tells him is perfectly normal which is putting it mildly. It is the conceit of ""Source Code"" that we find out what is going on at the same time Stevens does and the explanation is so complicated that its a good thing Dr. Rutledge the man who finally provides the details is played by as calm and persuasive an actor as Wright. Roughly stated it turns out that ""source code"" is the name for a mysterious process that allows Stevens to in effect go back in time to a kind of parallel universe and assume another persons identity for the last eight minutes of that mans life. Stevens cant change the past cant prevent that train explosion but he can affect the future. His assignment during those eight minutes is to identity the bomber an individual who simply must be stopped before he plants a bigger deadlier bomb in Chicago itself. It may sound like a version of hell for moviegoers to have those eight minutes on a train replayed over and over and over again half a dozen times at least but the film has come up with a surprising number of variations on that theme. Far from making ""Source Code"" dull those repetitions add to the tension as we wonder what Stevens will do next and how that choice will play out. It also helps that the film team has a feel for the genre. Duncan Jones first film was the Sam Rockwell- Kevin Spacey ""Moon"" cinematographer Don Burgess shot both ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Spider-Man"" and while writer Ben Ripley whose credits include the straight-to-video ""Species III"" stumbles in some areas his sense of plot is undeniably strong. ""Source Code"" is also fortunate in the actors it has for its quartet of key roles. Wrights quiet charisma is echoed by Farmiga who brings formidable controlled energy to an essentially desk-bound role but it is the people we see over and over again Gyllenhaal and Monaghan who make all the difference. Committed to the project even before a director was selected Gyllenhaal brings a sense of passionate belief and commitment to Stevens that ""Source Code"" could not succeed without. When you add in Monaghans trademark vivacious presence her ability to be fully alive in each and every one of those nominally repetitive moments science-fiction romance is definitely in the air. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSource Code propelled by Jake Gyllenhaal new on DVDJuly 24 2011Sylvester Stallone springs back into actionJuly 18 2010CHAOTIC (ka at ik) adj. 1. in a state of chaos; in a...July 2 2006Lights Camera Lawyers?December 10 1997MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentSource CodeGroundhog DayCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-source-code-20110401,0,2928465.story",200,sourcecode20,sourcecode,latimes

Bleary and disoriented hes addressed by the unknown woman sitting opposite him (Michelle Monaghan) as though they were old friends. Staggering to the restroom he sees a face he doesnt recognize in the mirror. Suddenly the train is blown sky high by a terrorist bomb. Then time rewinds and the countdown to destruction begins again. And again. ""Source Code"" is a bullet train of a thriller. It belongs to that well-worn sci-fi subgenre of time-looping where a character enters the past to change the future. This time its not a volunteer mission. U.S. Army Capt. Colter Stevens cant remember being drafted into the top-secret government program called ""source code."" Its aims are grudgingly explained to him by intelligence officers who address him through video screens in the isolation chamber where he recuperates between trips back to the doomed train. In their view hes an underling whose questions are wasting precious time. Stevens assignment is not to prevent the explosion. His task is to relive the final eight minutes of a dead passengers consciousness to discover the bombers identity so that a more catastrophic second attack can be averted. But Stevens is beginning to fall for the woman who was seated near him on the train that day. And hes enough of a rebel to try to outmaneuver his controllers and challenge the idea that his fate is already sealed. ""Source Code"" is nimbly directed by Duncan Jones whose 2009 ""Moon"" was probably the past decades smartest most ambitious science-fiction film. Although ""Source Codes"" premise is a Philip K. Dick-style mindbender Jones plays the story straight. The movie triggers memories of those classic Hitchcock suspense stories starring Jimmy Stewart or Cary Grant as a bystander abruptly thrust into life-or-death intrigue. Setting the action on a train gives the story a claustrophobic sense of urgency and a nice thematic resonance Is Stevens future also moving with unstoppable momentum on a fixed path? Gyllenhaals Stevens isnt a regulation action hero but a fallible desperate pawn of some emotional depth at one point battering a man he suspects is the bomber in a case of racial profiling gone wrong. Jonathan Wenk Summit Entertainment Jake Gyllenhaal plays a super-secret agent torn between duty and a romantic interest in ""Source Code."" As his seatmate Monaghan has the good looks sparky intelligence and quick tongue that establish her as a girl one could swiftly fall in love with. Vera Farmiga delivers a three-dimensional performance as Stevens dour military overseer. Its remarkable the way she earns our trust through a hundred little details betrayed to us by her tightened mouth and inwardly troubled eyes. The estimable Jeffrey Wright creates something new as the peevish head of the source code operation a mad scientist in the bureaucratic mold. Every player gives it that little something extra (substance energy gravitas) to help the story linger in our minds a little longer.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The title of ""Source Code would lead you to believe you are in for another one of those breathless inane computer thrillers -- something with Sandra Bullock clackety-clacking on the keyboard in a race to save the free world. Sorry not even close; this ones about Jake Gyllenhaal being forced to go back in time over and over again in an effort to catch a mad bomber. Sort of like ""Groundhog Day meets the old French brain-buster ""La Jetee (or its big-studio remake ""12 Monkeys). Im still not sure what ""source code means here. I suspect the actors the director and the screenwriter havent a clue either. But the thing keeps you watching.The movie opens disorientingly with Gyllenhaals character Air Force Captain Colter Stevens waking up in a commuter train across from a woman who insists on calling him George. When he looks in the restroom mirror he sees another mans face. Then the train blows up.The last Stevens knew he was in the middle of a battle in Afghanistan. Now he is trussed up in a tiny metal capsule talking by means of closed-circuit TV to a Defense Department wonk named Colleen (Vera Farmiga). She informs the hero that he will keep going back to that train until he finds the terrorist who planted the explosive device and who has subsequently aimed a dirty bomb at the greater Chicago area. Stevens has eight minutes each trip just enough time to realize how little time he has.Its as if he (and we) were stuck on a level of a video game attempting different strategies dying and starting again from square one. After a while all he wants to do is save the woman on the train whose name is Christina (Michelle Monaghan) and who had been hoping the co-worker whose body Stevens is renting would try something one of these days.Written by Ben Ripley ""Source Code is ingeniously structured as a mystery inside a mystery. Which one of the passengers is the bomber -- watch that racial profiling now -- and how did the hero even come to be a guinea pig in this twisted science experiment? Gyllenhaal has to solve the first by dashing about like a madman and the second by staying put and he brings enough emotional urgency even mournfulness to give the movie an unexpected gravitas.Director Duncan Jones -- shh hes David Bowies son but more to the point he directed 2009s fine little existential sci-fi drama ""Moon -- merely has to juggle two complicated plot lines and bring them together at just the right time. Id say he has the tougher job and he pulls it off well enough for us to seriously look forward to whatever Jones does next. (It wont be his future-noir dream project ""Mute which keeps getting delayed.)At the same time ""Source Code cant help but come down with the conceptual sillies from time to time. The situation is so preposterous and the characters attempts to explain it make for such bogus high-tech gobbledygook -- Jeffrey Wright does what he can with the stock role of the crippled Dr. Strangelove behind the experiment -- that you need a weed whacker just to keep sight of the plot. The movie plays with the metaphysics of time and causality and it gives Gyllenhaal a big Sisyphean rock to push uphill over and over but in no way does it enter the cosmically profound through the back door the way ""Groundhog Day did.It does keep you guessing though and the mystery of the bomber pays off nicely before the truth of the heros situation is revealed (no hes not dead). Unfortunately the more you think about the movie the less sense it makes even by the terms of its own internal logic. (For one thing how did they get the hero into the mind of a bystander who has already been blown to smithereens?) That goes double for the ending or maybe I should say quadruple. There are so many loose plot-strands left lying around it would be easy to turn one into a sequel.I cant say Id mind. It may be the only way to find out what the hell ""source code means.

Now hes back scrambling up the timeline with ""Source Code"" The story of a military man who can relive the last eight minutes of anothers life on the hunt for a train bomber By Mary Pols MaryPolsMarch 31 2011 Share Read Later Jonathan Wenk / Summit Entertainment Inc.Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Monaghan star in Source Code Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The science-fiction thriller Source Code starts in a state of glorious disorientation. Jake Gyllenhaal wakes up on a train. His comely seatmate Christina (Michelle Monaghan) is chattering away thanking him for some advice hes supposedly given her on a previous commute into Chicago. Shes a complete stranger and shes calling him Sean but hes Captain Colter Stevens a U.S. helicopter pilot who flies missions in Afghanistan thank you very much. Eight minutes later the train blows up. Talk about a lousy morning. Whereupon Colters thoroughly traumatized consciousness returns to the familiar territory of a cockpit where another woman (Vera Farmiga) hes never seen before appears on a monitor to brusquely tell him hes on a mission and she is about hit the reset button and send his brain back to the train. Her name is Goodwin and shes cool-eyed distant and as crisp as her uniform. Hes got an eight-minute window to locate the terrorist who blew up the train and the military will keep sending him back until he delivers the intelligence they need. Understandably Colter who never volunteered for this crazy Source Code Project has some qualms. But neither Goodwin nor the creator of this technology Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) -- his limp identifying him as a mad scientist a cheap crutch (literally) to establish not character but stereotype -- have any tolerance for Colters questions or confusion. They treat him like a dementia patient theyve lost patience with and though his growing desire to save Christina et al. is perfectly natural they are dismissive of his naive humanity. The point of this exercise is to find the bomber in time to save his next target (downtown Chicago) from a dirty bomb. The explosion is non-negotiable; the passengers including the girl and the body hes visiting are doomed. ""Source code is not time travel but rather time reassignment"" Dr. Rutledge growls. Colter is at the mercy of technology and the government and the movie is very eager to make sure we know this is a fearful condition. Colters actual detective work isnt riveting (the bomber is easy to identify) but watching Colters evolving reactions to his commuting companions is great fun like Groundhog Day with bombs. In contrast to the chill of the cockpit the train is warm and lively filled with entertaining characters including a stand-up comic (Russell Peters) a cocky college kid (Kyle Gatehouse) and a guy who is far too wired in for his own good (James A. Woods). Monaghan is charming and we sense the growing connection between her and Sean/Colter. Gyllenhaal whose youthful cuteness is now the slick handsomeness of a grownup movie star clearly savors the wit in Ben Ripleys screenplay. On his fifth or so unpleasant encounter with the wired-in guy Colter cuts him off with a quick quip ""Stay out of this tough guy it doesnt end well for you."" The role is all tension but hes relaxed within it and his pleasure is contagious. Thus it is a tremendous downer when the second half of the movie shirks logic defies its own established principles and raises more questions than it answers. Wright has a big hammy expository scene explaining the theory of Source Code but neglects to explain vital parts of its practice like how the military got access to Sean-the-sweet-history-teachers memories in the first place. Maybe Rutledges team picked through the wreckage looking for a not-quite-dead brain pounced on it and rushed it to Dr. Rutledge in an ice chest? There would be no harm in clarifying and the decision not to makes you wonder if the filmmakers themselves know the answer. Perhaps director Duncan Jones (whose Moon explored similar themes of twisted realities) just hoped wed be so riveted by the urgency of Colters quest that we wouldnt notice. Certainly Jones has a talent for jazzing up the standard set pieces of an action movie. Each time the train blows up you feel a little punch to the gut even though you know its coming and one version of the explosion with Monaghan and Gyllenhaal on their knees facing each other even achieves a sort of beauty -- Monaghans hand goes up as if in a pointless sad effort to stop the flames rolling toward them. There are times when Source Code with its distrust of technology and its sharp cynical take on the soldiers servitude feels like a Kubrickrian twist on Johnny Got His Gun. But you would have to be really smitten to ignore the liberties it takes with its own semi-logic in order to rebel against the machine. The ending must be intended for audience satisfaction but it provides the exact opposite. Were disoriented all over again this time far from gloriously.

Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Source Code >> You jolt awake on the train; the woman in the facing seat is talking to you but addressing you by someone elses name. Deal with that later. Right now you have this sickening premonition that you have to save the world and that time is most emphatically not on your side. Never experienced that on the 742 a.m. express into the city? Well it happens to Jake Gyllenhaals character in the choppy thriller Source Code. Over and over and over again. What the deuce is going on? The last thing you knew you were a combat pilot on a mission over Afghanistan. Now you seem to be a civilian repeatedly revisiting this urgent scenario like youre stuck in some kind of truncated Groundhog Day. Luckily the brief span you are given - precisely eight minutes - proves to be remarkably elastic. It can go by in a flash or it can take up the whole last reel of the film. In between trips on the cuckoo choochoo you are yourself again Capt. Colter Stevens. But harnessed in some isolated cargo hold. On a small screen your handlers with growing frustration are trying to get you to focus on the task at hand. Youre trying to follow the instructions of an Air Force officer with kind eyes (Vera Farmiga) and a blustery scientist (Jeffrey Wright). You know that hes brilliant because he hobbles around with a forearm crutch. But why are they spoon-feeding you information? Why not just tell you what to do on the train and how to do it rather than have you stumble through it time and again? Meanwhile youre sort of falling for that cute woman (Michelle Monaghan) on the train the one who keeps calling you Sean. Great now you have to find and disarm a sophisticated device identify and subdue the bomber and get the girl. Ticktock buddy. The clock is running. Source Code certainly gives the audience a lot to chew on. But very little of it is digestible. The quantum physics premise doesnt make sense the villain is neither convincing nor creepy the incremental narrative quickly grows tedious and the film has all the continuity of Gary Busey on meth. Gyllenhaal is particularly unsuited to this role his saucer eyes flashing from calm to crazed. For most of the film he resembles a horse that has just smelled smoke in the adjoining stall. It doesnt help that the recurring calamity Gyllenhaal keeps failing to forestall looks so chintzy. Or that the dialogue is so clunky. ""How much time does he have?"" asks a frantic Farmiga. ""Some"" mutters Wright darkly ""but not a lot."" Why beat around the bush? Its eight minutes. He always has eight minutes.

"Source Code (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Source Code (PG-13) Reliving a nightmare eight minutes at a time Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald3/31/2011 Editor rating 2.5 Source Code director Duncan Jones follow-up to his much more ambitious sci-fi head trip Moon begins with a grabber of an opener An American soldier named Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) whose last memory consists of being shot down while in combat in Afghanistan awakens with a start aboard a Chicago commuter train. Colter is dressed like a civilian has no clue how he got there or why pretty young Christina (Michelle Monaghan) sitting across from him is yakking his ear off and calling him ""Sean"" as if they were BFFs. Rattled Colter excuses himself to go to the bathroom looks in the mirror and sees a strangers face staring back at him. He checks his drivers license and sure enough the ID is not his. Understandably bewildered -- wouldnt you be? -- Colter tries to figure out what is happening when eight minutes later the train blows up in a spectacular fireball killing everyone aboard. Those first few minutes seize your attention with uncommon urgency. Too bad the movie is never that good again. If youve seen the trailers for Source Code then you already know the trickery afoot. Suffice to say that Colter/Sean didnt really die in the blast He awakens in a strange cocoon where a government agent whose name may well be Exposition (Vera Farmiga) informs him hes been drafted to participate in an experiment in which he can enter the last eight minutes of a persons life undetected -- no one around him will notice anything different -- and his mission is to figure out which passenger on the train is carrying the bomb then stop him before it goes off. The assignment requires Colter to return again and again to the train reliving those fateful eight minutes like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day although the tone is the opposite of comedic. For a while Colters attempts to unmask the bomber prove exciting Hes free to do anything he wants since the device is going to go off -- and keep going off -- every few minutes. But with each failed attempt the terrorists get one step closer to carrying out their ultimate plan which is to detonate another bomb in the middle of downtown Chicago. He fails a lot. Gyllenhaal who looked uncomfortable and out of place in Prince of Persia Sands of Time is infinitely more likable as the Jimmy Stewart-ish hero who must figure out a way to prevent the unthinkable (some of his tactics born of desperation result in beating up a lot of innocent people). But a sense of rote inevitably creeps into the movie because you can watch a character try to accomplish the same thing only so many times. The script by Ben Ripley doesnt come up with enough obstacles to throw in the heros path and his budding romance with the doomed Christina feels more like a studio mandate than an organic development. Part of what made Moon such an auspicious debut was the way in which Jones refused to give the audience any of the usual bearings. That movie had to be figured out in the viewers head as it unfolded and the finale allowed for multiple interpretations. Not so much with Source Code which seems to end at least three times before finally reaching the most predictable and sentimental of all possible conclusions. The film is never exactly boring thanks to Gyllenhaals tireless performance but its time-travel paradoxes will seem a lot more intriguing when youre playing them over in your head than while youre watching them.

"Return trips to mayhem keep Source Code entertaining - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Return trips to mayhem keep Source Code entertainingSource Code a 3 starsMarch 31 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticCall it strangeness on a train. The highly gimmicky very entertaining new thriller ""Source Code"" takes place mostly on a passenger car part of the fictional Chicago Commuter Rail line speeding toward the Loop carrying a bomb planted by an unknown terrorist. Our point person in this pressurized scenario knows nothing about the detonation to come how he got there where hes getting off or how he came to know his chatty sympathetic fellow passenger played by Michelle Monaghan. Rough commute Utter disorientation followed by fireballs.Then someone hits the ""reset"" button and Jake Gyllenhaal must relive those eight minutes in hopes of a better outcome. Written by Ben Ripley with relentless focus on structure and a tiny bit left over for character ""Source Code"" wisely does not stretch out its guessing games regarding Gyllenhaals character past the point of exasperation. The actor who has a dogged way of staying calm under the craziest narrative circumstances plays a decorated U.S. Army helicopter pilot and Afghanistan war veteran who upon that first explosion wakes up to find hes actually in an American military lab in a tightly confined space. He communicates only with Capt. Goodwin played by Vera Farmiga who answers to the so-called Source Code experiments creator Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright who has a witty way with a bureaucratic rascal). The team has only hours to solve the inevitable train bombing thereby preventing a larger more deadly threat on the horizon.Comparisons to ""Groundhog Day"" can and have been made willy-nilly. This movie is really several eight-minute films -- an omnibus feature unto itself. Each time Gyllenhaals Capt. Stevens time-travels back to the same place on the train and the same fateful final minutes he scrambles to piece together a little more of the puzzle. ""Find the bomb and you will find the bomber"" Goodwin says. Chicagos fate not to mention its future cinematic exploitation possibilities hangs in the balance.I like the size and scale and itchy excitement of this medium-budget picture (reportedly in the 30 million-40 million range). While Monaghan has played richer roles shes very shrewd about finding variations on a theme and forcing the audience to regard her character a little differently in each replay. Stevens realizes he really really really likes the Monaghan character and would like very very very much to save her. Can Rutledges grand plans accommodate this impulse? While I dont find Gyllenhaal the most exciting leading man hes effective in conveying straightforward sincere devotion to a romantic cause.Director Duncan Jones made a considerable impression with his earlier feature ""Moon"" starring Sam Rockwell which told of an isolated man caught in a different sort of technological crisis. Shot almost entirely on soundstages in Montreal ""Source Code"" necessarily maintains a rhythm one might describe as ""here we go again"" (if the movie doesnt work for you) or ""one more time"" (if it does). The recent ""Vantage Point"" which rehashed the same political assassination from a wearying number of angles never quite transcended its contrivances. ""Source Code"" is a contraption no doubt. But it works.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for some violence including disturbing images and for language)Cast Jake Gyllenhaal (Capt. Colter Stevens); Michelle Monaghan (Christina); Vera Farmiga (Capt.

Across from him sits Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) whos cheerily engaging him in the kind of conversation that tends to morph easily into flirting.Colter might be interested except for one thing He has no idea how he got on the train. His paranoia gets ramped up when another mans face stares back at him from a bathroom mirror.In only a few minutes a major disaster will further rock Colters worldview. Thats when he gets to meet Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and her boss Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) who inform him that theyre conducting a scientific experiment. Colters role guinea pig. His mission to prevent the disaster hes just experienced identify the person responsible and stop a greater tragedy from occurring. And if it takes him a few tries to get it right thats OK -- within limits.""Source Code"" is ""Groundhog Day"" with a ticking bomb instead of jokes. Working from a screenplay by Ben Ripley director Duncan Jones (""Moon"") delivers 90 percent of a great film. Its that last 10 that may have you scratching your head and mumbling ""What exactly happened?"" Without dropping any spoilers lets just say that ""Source Code"" has significant problems with logic even by the standards of a science-fiction movie. The cast however is terrific. Gyllenhaal (""Brokeback Mountain"") who seems intent on becoming a mainstream star after an impressive career in independent film turns in an engaging action-hero performance. Monaghan (""Gone Baby Gone"") is terrific as the romantic interest. And Farmiga (""Up in the Air"") and Wright (""Quantum of Solace"") lend panache to their formulaic characters.""Source Code"" isnt as smart or adventurous as it might have been.

Id love to hear the Source Code guys explain to their sci-fi peers exactly how their neural gadgetry enables a participants brainpower and consciousness to cross over into the body of another man in the last eight minutes of that other mans life. As it is Ill have to take the futuristic science on faith along with the plot holes in this good-looking diverting overly jiggered adventure. And Ill accept the premise that decorated Army helicopter pilot Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) inexplicably finds himself on a Chicago commuter train tasked with finding out who on the train planted the bomb that eight minutes later will destroy the very train hes on. Whoever it is is also planning a second bigger even more destructive act of terrorism in the heart of the city. Is it the angry wannabe comedian (played by real comic Russell Peters)? Is it the suspiciously sweating swarthy-skinned businessman (Cas Anvar)? Whos Christina (Michelle Monaghan) the attractive woman sitting opposite Stevens on the train chatting as if she knows him? And why when Stevens is in the lavatory does he play a Marx Brothers mime game with an unknown face in the mirror? Is that strange reflection his...avatar? If Stevens finds the bomber in time he can prevent that second catastrophe. And so while the soldiers own body is holed up in cramped quarters his consciousness is guided into the past and into the body of a stranger by his handler (Vera Farmiga doing what she can with a character mostly seen as a face on a computer monitor) and her boss (Jeffrey Wright projecting weird comic-villain voodoo into his bit as a Shadowy Government Type). Stevens is projected time after Groundhog Day time into those last eight minutes enduring explosion after explosion until he can solve the crime. The Inception guys would understand all this perfectly even as the audience is left scrambling to untangle the plot twists on the way out of the movie theater. Myself Im rapidly tiring of pinball storytelling constructions that substitute cerebral fanciness of format for the weight of emotional content. But hold that thought -- for eight minutes. Source Code directed by Duncan Jones from a buzzing talky original screenplay by Ben Ripley (Species III) is the bigger-budget follow-up to Jones cool haunting self-contained 2009 debut feature Moon. The filmmakers fondness -- and real knack -- for sci-fi is evident in the way he keeps things rolling having fun with the confines of the train car (and the claustrophobic pod Stevens inhabits between missions) the same way Jones got a kick out of Sam Rockwells isolation aboard a spaceship in Moon. Stevens fails until he succeeds and each explosion is a pleasurable shock. Each repetition of unfolding events altered as Stevens gains a finer understanding of his surroundings is a nifty little scenario held together by nimble work from Gyllenhaal. Among all the chess-piece players on the board the star is the only one who really builds a solid emotional foundation for his character. After his Goldilocksian casting misadventures in Prince of Persia and Love amp; Other Drugs the role is an excellent fit -- which is no doubt why Gyllenhaal grabbed the script for himself and brought it to Jones. As a result we care about Stevens more and more and the investment pays off for (most of) the final leg of the journey. I wish we could have cared more about Monaghans Christina and the love that is meant to be growing between her and Stevens with every repetition. But the character is just another support vehicle for the story -- shes the Girl -- and Monaghan cant do much besides look concerned as her seatmate behaves oddly. Source Code bats around interesting philosophical ideas about the elasticity of time and the director finds moments of humor in unlikely corners of that train of fools. The movie is also as time goes by about less than it thinks it is. So my question for that Source Code?Inception summit I was dreaming about would be Is emotional disposability built into the structure of a movie like this? You know like a source code?

Colter Stevens wakes up on a commuter train hurtling toward Chicago. Source Code Good Director Duncan Jones. Cast Jake Gyllenhaal Michelle Monaghan Vera Farmiga. Rating PG-13 for some violence including disturbing images and for language. Guide to this weeks new releases What? Stevens is a fighter pilot who last remembers flying missions in Afghanistan. But here he is in civilian clothes and now the pretty woman across from him is talking to him seems to know him seems to maybe like him. And she keeps calling him Sean Fentress. Understandably shaken and confused Stevens bounces around the train trying to figure out what is happening. Things get worse when he looks in the bathroom mirror - that is not his face. He goes back to his seat he talks to the woman about . . . And the train explodes. Stevens wakes up in some sort of industrial pod talking to a military officer over a video monitor. Confused? Good. Director Duncan Jones has you right where you wants you. His ""Source Code"" is a gripping mind game that could cause a headache to describe much less figure out. But whats really cool about the film - in addition to Jake Gyllenhaals performance as Stevens - is how Jones makes sure that we dont know any more than Stevens does right up till the end. And even then; sadly the ending falters under the forced logic of the setup. But the ride is a lot more fun than the one Stevens is taking. The officer Stevens is talking to is Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) and she has no time or interest in niceties such as explaining anything more to Stevens than the minimum he needs to know. She and Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) impatiently inform Stevens that the commuter train did explode this morning killing everyone on board but thanks to new ""source code"" technology Rutledge has developed they can insert Stevens back into the train in someone elses body for eight minutes at a time to try to learn the identity of the bomber. He cant prevent the explosion - that ship has sailed. But he might be able to stop the bomber who is heading for the city armed with dirty bombs and bad intentions. There is no time to waste. Stevens has the usual reactions - disbelief anger impatience - but soon is back on the train again talking with the woman Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan). Again. And again. And again. Each time Stevens learns a little more and each time his impatience grows stronger. Why him? Why cant he prevent the blast? Where is he? Meanwhile he grows closer with Christina who wonders why hes acting so strangely. A lazy way to describe ""Source Code"" would be as a sort of dramatic retelling of ""Groundhog Day."" But while it shares the revisiting-the-moment element thats really the only connection. Getting caught up in comparisons will only lessen the enjoyment and there is much to enjoy here. First and foremost is Gyllenhaal who never makes Stevens so cynical or irate that his anger diminishes his heroism. This is a different kind of fighting in a different kind of war perhaps - at least thats the underlying idea. But all war demands sacrifice. Getting blown up every eight minutes would certainly seem to qualify. Farmiga is always good so its no surprise that Goodwins journey from cold reason to empathy is believable. Monaghan has a nice chemistry with Gyllenhaal and Wright is effectively arrogant. But the star here is Jones who manages to paper over most of the holes in Ben Ripleys script with pure adrenaline and keep us guessing - and enthralled - all the while.

It signaled the arrival of an artist with an appreciation for the past but also with his own clear unique voice ready to leave a distinctive stamp on the culture. And it was the best movie of the year -- according to this critic at least. ""Source Code"" represents his evolution as a director now that he has a bigger cast and more expensive toys to play with. Its swifter glossier more ambitious. And for a long time its a thrilling and challenging puzzle based on a clever idea -- until it pushes its central gimmick and gets too greedy at the end that is. Itll make your brain hurt (in a good way) trying to determine whether it all makes sense -- until it quite obviously and frustratingly doesnt make sense anymore. It also aims for some emotional connections it doesnt fully develop. Maybe were nitpicking needlessly and should just let ourselves go with it. Still it leaves you with the nagging sensation that this is a good film that could have been great if only it had quit while it was ahead. Based on a script by Ben Ripley ""Source Code"" keeps us as consistently confused and off-guard from the start as its main character U.S. Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal). And to be fair to you itll be tough to describe what happens here without giving the aforementioned fun-of-the-puzzle away. But well try. Source Code director is David Bowies son A decorated soldier from the battle in Afghanistan Colter wakes up one morning disoriented on a commuter train heading toward Chicago. Across from him is a sweet and beautiful woman (Michelle Monaghan) whom hes never seen before yet shes talking to him with the familiarity of a friend. He takes a quick glance at himself in the bathroom mirror and is startled to discover hes in the body of another man one he doesnt know. Within minutes the train has blown up killing everyone on board -- but Colter suddenly finds himself still alive strapped inside a crude metal pod communicating by monitor with an Air Force captain (Vera Farmiga). She explains that hes part of a special assignment called ""Source Code"" designed to allow him to enter the body of another man for eight minutes. His task is to gain valuable information and hopefully prevent a later larger terrorist attack. And so Colter must go back and relive the same eight minutes over and over again gleaning more details each time. Yes this will probably remind you of ""Groundhog Day"" but this is also where ""Source Code"" is at its most zippy and compelling -- and strangely at its most plausible. Gyllenhaal who helped developed the character makes Colters fear anger and general discombobulation palpable but ""Source Code"" also allows him some much-needed flashes of humor. The supporting cast is strong down the line including Jeffrey Wright as the coldly driven brains of the operation and even in the choice of actors on the train who only get a couple of lines but have significance with each eight-minute go-round. The score is a little insistent and intrusive especially compared to the gorgeous and haunting score from ""Moon"" and Jones could have made more of an impact at times with silence. But we should probably quit while were ahead too and let you discover the secrets of ""Source Code"" for yourself -- and decide whether they actually add up. (c) 2013 The Associated Press.

It may not be Un film de Duncan Jones but it is an efficient entertaining thriller that features several striking signature sequences and some smart conceptual ideas.Jake Gyllenhaal is edgy and engaging as confused Blackhawk helicopter pilot Captain Colter Stevens who wakes up on a Chicago commuter train with no clue how he got there or what his mission is. The attractive woman seated opposite Christina (Michelle Monaghan) seems to think hes a school teacher called Sean and the face reflected in the train window is not his. Suddenly an explosion rips through the train and Colter finds himself in what may be the cockpit of his crashed chopper. Via a video screen uniformed military minder Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) explains that Colter is part of an experimental project which allows access to a parallel reality for eight minutes at a time. And he has to keep going back in - not to stop the explosion which has already happened but to identify the terrorist on the train who has also planted a dirty bomb in the city.Rather than get bogged down in the scientific explanations Ben Ripleys intricate script and Joness brisk direction invite us to climb aboard and enjoy the ride. But if you want to dig deeper there is some serious stuff about a guy lost in fragments of time groping towards a sense of his own identity. Theres also an involving emotional undertow thanks to Colters fragmented romance with Monaghans loveable teacher-next-door and the burgeoning human connection between Farmigas delicately nuanced minder and Gyllenhaals angry yet vulnerable guinea pig.

Michelle Monaghan also great and the chemistry between the two leads kept me hanging in through all the repeats. I did find the Vera Farmiga role a bit unrealistic - lots of close-ups of facial emoting meant to signal to the audience her inner conflict yawn.

Dick-like in scope than the recent Dick adaptation The Adjustment Bureau--is a propulsive ride worth your popcorn dollar not for its preposterous genre tinkering but for its refreshingly humanist take on a high-concept gimmick.Like Moons Sam Rockwell before him a totally game Jake Gyllenhaal is the movies glue as Captain Colter Stevens a decorated pilot and Hitchcockian everyman who wakes up on a commuter train to Chicago unaware who his garrulous seatmate is. (That would be underutilized actress Michelle Monaghan again nailing the thankless role of Pretty Girl.) A quick peek in the restroom mirror confirms Colter is in another mans body and a few confusing moments after that he and everyone onboard are engulfed in a terrorist explosion. Materializing back in the Twilight Zone--a dank concrete techno-cell where hes debriefed via video chat by military handler Goodwin (Vera Farmiga)--Colter learns of his role in the titular government experiment for which his mind will re-live an avatars last eight minutes to gather clues and hopefully prevent a deadlier attack by catching the dirty bomber.Source Codes two-minute trailer sets most of that up but doesnt hint at screenwriter Ben Ripleys hits-to-misses ratio.  Like every time-travel yarn (though technically the time-loop logic here has more in common with Groundhog Day than 12 Monkeys) there are far-fetched plot wrinkles and quickly reeled-off quantum claptrap to distract us from the impossibilities so lets try suspending our disbelief in favor of a salvaged consciousness kept alive and ""time reassignment."" Just as our brains fill in the periphery of our vision with a seamless blur of what we think exists Colters choose-his-own-adventure courses of action should be limited to the last sensory experiences of the dead man he inhabits. Never-before-had conversations between characters make for enticing drama but how the hell can our man peer into heating ducts or even get off the train to notice MacGuffins that werent discovered in the real-time wreckage? Not that any B-movie lover should care to play high school physics teacher and even co-star Jeffrey Wright (wonderfully hammy here as a shifty bureaucrat who lords over Goodwin) offers the most telling line ""The source code is a gift. Dont squander it by thinking.""Most likely you wont since the films secret weapon isnt its tension-mounting puzzle solving sleek sense of visual claustrophobia or philosophical questioning--but rather its sneaky compassion. Halfway through the film Colter accepts his fate yet still refuses to allow these strangers on a train to meet their doom no matter how many times he channels his inner Bill Murray. As he runs through the honest emotions of a non-action-hero stuck in a tour-of-duty spin cycle deservedly angry at times when he isnt merely baffled or frustrated Colters sense of loyalty to these innocents kicks into overdrive. Knowingly futile as his quest is to save people who have already met their fiery demise and who also forget him with each flip of the hourglass Gyllenhaal sells that personal sense of wish fulfillment with real heart.

"Source Code | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; source-code ) Source Code (United States 2011) March 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Source Code is what might happen if one cross-bred Groundhog Day with 24 and The Matrix. The resultant offspring is not as trippy or successful as any of its parents but it fits nicely into the growing niche of mind-bending virtual reality experiences in which ""existence"" is more a state of mind than a state of being. And while Source Code probably isnt as smart as it pretends to be (or wants us to think it is) it will result in some viewers ruminating about the multiverse and quantum mechanics. For the masses (as opposed to the geeks who understand the previous sentence) this is a decent mind-bending thriller. Many may find it a bit repetitive (as with Groundhog Day there is the palpable dA(c)jA  vu) and more than a few will be confused. Things start out normally enough. Sean (Jake Gyllenhaal) awakens from a nap on a Chicago-bound commuter train. Sitting across from him is his pretty platonic pal Christina (Michelle Monaghan). But theres a problem. Sean is disoriented and more than that he is convinced that hes not Sean. His real name is Colter Stevens and hes supposed to be serving in Afghanistan not trading pleasantries with an attractive woman while a conductor asks him for his ticket. Eight minutes later the train blows up and Colter finds himself strapped into a seat in what appears to be a space capsule. Its leaking hydraulic fluid. A screen flickers to life in front of him and a woman Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) provides an ambiguous debriefing. He is in fact Colter Stevens but through the magic of virtual reality he is being placed into the ""source code"" and allowed to take over the mind and body of Sean during the final eight minutes of his life. Each time he enters the source code he ventures into an alternate reality. His goal find out who planted the bomb on the train because there are indications that the same terrorist intends to detonate a dirty bomb in the middle of Chicago. In addition to completing his mission Colter decides to save Christina and determine why someone who should be in Afghanistan is trapped in something that looks like it was created for Battlestar Galactica. Does all of this make sense? Not really but there are some interesting ideas in Ben Ripleys screenplay. Fundamental logical flaws aside (plenty of which are readily identifiable for anyone who takes some time to coolly and rationally consider them) Source Code is guilty of overreaching which is a claim few films can make. At times the movie does some intriguing things. On other occasions it turns preposterous. The ending while not as maddening as that of Inception offers an instance of infinite recursion that boggles the mind and provides a glimpse of what is meant by ""an infinite number of universes."" How far down the rabbit hole can one go? At its heart however Source Code is a mystery/thriller. Its about a guy with a time limit trying to find a suspect before he lets loose hell in the United States third-largest city. To enrich the pot there are secondary questions surrounding Sean/Colters true identity and the circumstances that led to his involvement in the ""source code"" project. Things are not as they seem. And what is the role of the mysterious Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright) who is frequently lurking in the background behind Goodwin? Source Code is well paced and energetic; its unlikely to bore anyone. One doesnt have to fully understand all its existential and quasi-science fiction elements in order to appreciate the way things play out. Jake Gyllenhaal is a solid choice for Colter; he provides a stable and affable anchor as well as an ""entry point"" for the viewer. When things start hes as confused as we are and the explanations with which he is provided aid in our understanding. Michelle Monaghan is fetching as the idealized potential love interest and Vera Farmiga provides more personality than one might expect from a face at the other end of a video link. Ultimately however their roles are secondary. This is Gyllenhaals movie. The most glaring fault aside from the occasional obtuseness (which is only a problem to viewers who demand clear linear plot lines) is its necessary repetitiveness. Director Duncan Jones whose previous sci-fi venture was Moon faces a challenge How to depict the same 8-minute time period a number of times without boring his audience. By varying pace and modifying character actions and reactions he largely accomplishes this (in much the same way that Harold Ramis did with Groundhog Day) but there are times when the need for familiar touchstones within that window become cumbersome. More than one viewer will find himself waiting for things to go ""boom"" rather than paying attention to the specifics of whats happening on screen. Its not hard to find common threads in Source Code and Moon. Both are smarter and more science-oriented than the average genre entry. Both feature men trapped in states of isolation. And both explore questions of identity. Source Code is more action-oriented and as a result has a stronger likelihood of mainstream acceptance. Its a fascinating and atypical choice for a major studio release and indicates that even in this era of cookie-cutter plots and braindead spectacles filmmakers with original ideas and visions continue to toil.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Dullness of Being Earnest In a Better World is socially worthy--and utterly joyless. By David Edelstein Published Mar 27 2011 ShareThis In a Better Worlds Mikael Persbrandt and Trine Dyrholm.  (Photo Per Arnesen/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics) Its easy to see why the Danish director Susanne Biers brutal drama In a Better World has its admirers among them this years foreign-language Oscar voters. Like Bier we all dream of living in a kinder gentler world but are forced to contend with the barbaric behaviors of this one. We know that the quest for retribution destabilizes societies and poisons our souls. But we also know that bullies must be stopped. Bier dramatizes our ambivalence so earnestly that its tempting to give her awards rather than admit that the movie is a crushing bore. Bier jumps back and forth between a town in Denmark and a refugee camp in Africa the link being Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) a Swedish doctor who commutes. These seem like vastly different places--but are they really? Every so often refugees drag in women whove been butchered by a local kingpin who likes to bet with his soldiers on the sex of unborn children. In Denmark meanwhile Antons nerdy son Elias (Markus Rygaard) is regularly menaced by schoolyard bullies and once or twice Anton gets slapped around by an ill-tempered local mechanic. To the dismay of the Africans Anton will treat the murderous kingpin for a maggot-ridden leg. To the dismay of his son and his sons friend Christian (William Johnk Nielsen) he will refuse to punch the mechanic back. ""Hes a jerk"" Anton explains to the appalled kids. ""If I beat him up Im a jerk too. What kind of world would we have?"" A decent B-movie world anyway. Given the cartoonish evil of the predators as subtly drawn as the scummy thugs in the average Sylvester Stallone picture its hard not to see Anton as a simp and a wimp. But Bier drags out his not especially expressive inaction for nearly two hours while wishy-washy authority figures refuse to exercise their authority. As a counterpoint she has Christian (ironic name alert) who lost his mother to cancer and now simmering with rage toward his impotent dad (Ulrich Thomsen) refuses to turn the other cheek He bashes bullies with steel bars and mixes up a bomb to make life hell for tormentors. In this sort of socially responsible movie kids with explosives are bound to have accidents. Biers dialogue is dull-witted her scenario so neatly diagrammed its a wonder you dont get an ethics supplement with your ticket. This is an Oprah movie. If I seem unusually derisive its because Bier has taken an exploitation premise slowed it to a crawl and sprinkled in horrific atrocities. She only thinks shes better-worldly. Seeing everything early and refusing to watch any coming attractions I often go into a movie with no idea of its premise sometimes not even its genre. Thats a good way to approach Source Code which for half its (brief) length is thrillingly disorienting. Ill try not to orient you here except to say its largely set on a Chicago commuter train and kind of like a Philip K. Dick rewrite of Groundhog Day with each time loop (if it is a time loop--mums the word) offering the equally disoriented hero (Jake Gyllenhaal) another chance to correct for past mistakes and accumulate more data. Directed by Duncan Jones (Moon) from Ben Ripleys screenplay its a crackerjack ride shot and edited for maximum discombobulation. Those who inexplicably convinced themselves that Matt Damon and Emily Blunt had romantic chemistry in The Adjustment Bureau should check out true heat courtesy of Gyllenhaals unblinking baby blues and Michelle Monaghans irrepressible glow. Dick would love the paranoid setup and probably hate the cheat of a denouement. But it all goes by too irresistibly fast to call a time-out for disbelief. In the spook chiller Insidious the Saw guys join forces with the Paranormal Activity guys for some low-tech haunted-house high jinks with a patina of Poltergeist slickness. The thing is scary as hell when its all creaks and thumps and doors swinging open. Then come the explanations the special effects and the inevitable feeling of been-there-been-bombarded-by-that. Its gore-free which means they spare your eyes but batter your ears. Fear not the reaper--only tinnitus. In a Better World Sony Pictures Classics. R. Source Code Summit Entertainment. PG-13.

His career is only two movies old but director Duncan Jones seems to specialize in science fiction that reminds you very much of other movies. Moon (2009) certainly evoked 2001 for many critics and now he delivers Source Code a dead-ringer for Groundhog Day only without the laughs. Still if youre going to redo a classic -- after 18 years thats not too far-fetched a designation is it? -- Source Code makes several clever adjustments the most important being the insertion a ticking clock into a series of events running in a continual loop. Its four main actors play sharply delineated characters not with much depth but hey who has time for depth when Chicago is about to blow up? Source Code which premiered at South by Southwest could develop into a minor hit for Summit Entertainment thanks to the fine casting a sense of claustrophobia and an intriguing race against time. Jake Gyllenhaal awakens to find himself on a commuter train approaching the Windy City. A pretty and chatty seatmate Michelle Monaghan takes up a conversation begun apparently several minutes earlier but the man has two problems He has no idea who she is and much worse who he is. A quick trip to a toilet mirror confirms his worst fears He is in another mans body. The last thing the Air Force captain remembers he was flying a plane in Afghanistan. The film gradually reveals the heros true situation His mind is in the control of a government project dubbed ""Source Code"" which allows him to relive the last eight minutes in the life of a man who died on that commuter train as did all passengers when a bomb exploded. His mission is to continue to relive those eight minutes until he can identify the bomber and prevent a much greater attack threatened against the city later that day. Putting him through these minutes over and over again is a slightly cold and cerebral scientist (Jeffrey Wright) and therefore a slightly sinister one and his loyal-to-a-point assistant (Vera Farmiga) who is much better at empathizing with the poor captain than her boss. As in Groundhog Day the protagonist can change events within the prescribed time frame so that in each go-around he comes away with more clues about the mystery of the bomber. Each foray into the immediate past also further insinuates the man into the lives of both his fellow passenger and his female government controller. The question hanging over all this of course is whether the hero can prevent the deaths of the passengers as well as capture the bomber. Wrights scientist insists this is not possible as Source Code does not represent time travel but rather ""time reassignment."" No prevention of disaster is possible; all the captain can do is identify the culprit so he can be captured before reaching Chicago. The Gyllanhaal character despite exhaustion over having to be killed time after time believes otherwise. Farmigas skeptical officer isnt so certain either way and Monaghan of course is clueless about her impending fate. Ben Ripleys screenplay gives Jones plenty of tension to work with enough so that the director throws in aerial shots of the train and a few exterior scenes in train stations to relieve the audience of what amounts to a three-set movie --  the train control station and a weird capsule where Gyllanhaals character retreats between episodes aboard the train. In the end filmgoers will either buy into the implausible events or not. Not helping in this matter is an ending that renders much of this nonsensical one that strives for a ""feel good"" moment but at the expense of too much logic flying out the window. As a consequence Source Code reminds you somewhat of an old B sci-fier where ideas trump VFX and sci-fi dazzle. The small nuances -- a spilled cup of coffee or a wallet left behind -- mean more than a fiery bomb or the unwieldy explanation behind this government experiment. The movie boils down to one character acting under enormous pressures of space and time racing to solve a mystery. In this case that may be good enough.

Solid execution and some provocative ideas cant save ""Source Code"" from a fatal hubris as it thinks itself far more clever than it actually is and assumes its earned emotions at which its only hinted. Sophomore director Duncan Jones is becoming an adept craftsman of such modestly scaled cerebral speculative fiction and had this been a SyFy original movie it would have been most impressive. But as a follow-up to the startlingly inventive ""Moon"" ""Source Code"" just doesnt quite compute. SXSW opener ought to do solid but unspectacular business with better odds in ancillary. Summarizing this film is a dicey proposition as the primary enjoyment to be had lies in gradually piecing together the rules of engagement. From the start the audience is just as confused as the films protagonist Army Capt. Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he awakens from a nap on a commuter train heading toward Chicago opposite Christina (Michelle Monaghan) who seems to be his girlfriend and addresses him as Sean. After a flurry of confusion in which he sees another mans reflection in the mirror the train suddenly explodes in a massive blast killing all aboard. Snapped back into his own body Colter finds himself in a damp cement-and-concrete cell communicating with fellow soldier Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) via videoscreen. After even more confusion the basic premise emerges Colter is a participant in an experimental Army intelligence project in which he can continually relive the last eight minutes of this commuters life ""Groundhog Day""-style in order to find the bomb on the train and identify the bomber who has threatened to follow up this attack with a dirty-bomb detonation in downtown Chicago. The head scientist (Jeffrey Wright) begins to explain how this is possible with a lecture ending ""It would take weeks to explain."" But even the most far-fetched sci-fi premise is worth going along with if it thoughtfully examines its own ramifications whereas ""Source Code"" treats this brain-teasing notion as though its all a clever riddle albeit one without a particularly interesting solution. Its also one that requires quantum leaps in logic the most jarring being the idea that these scientists can use ""parabolic calculus"" to seamlessly integrate a foreign consciousness into the ""afterglow"" of dead brain cells but cant locate the origin of an explosion by simply observing the wreckage. More promising is Colters ethical dilemma as he quickly develops deep affection for his fellow passengers (the actors include comedian Russell Peters who is at least given a convincing reason to do a bit of standup) and begins plotting ways to save them even though theyre already dead. This couldve given rise to a somber parable on the nobility of fighting against fate -- and the film hints at some intriguing Zoroastrian concepts here -- but its ultimately just employed to force an emotional undercurrent into what otherwise feels like an observational exercise. The various third-act twists just add further wrinkles to the plot without really developing the premise and most viewers will be able to spot the guilty party long before Colter does. ""Source Code"" subsists on a sustained note of claustrophobia -- both physical and temporal -- and Jones handles the gradual widening of the films visual scope with great aplomb moving from tight angles and disorienting cutting to something more stable and comprehensible. Theres a number of great shots (particularly a flourish up through the trains heating vents) and the production design is lovely. Gyllenhaal could likely do this sort of bedroom-eyed soldier role in his sleep but he plays the part with great energy and conviction. Farmiga uses the opportunity to add another warmly maternal bureaucrat role to her scorecard and Wright makes for a nicely sinister string-puller.
