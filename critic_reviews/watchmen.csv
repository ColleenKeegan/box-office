"Review Watchmen lacks imagination - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Watchmen lacks imaginationStory Highlights ""Watchmen"" is so devoted to the comic book it misses vision says Tom Charity Film is based on renowned graphic novel about misfit crimefighters A few good performances but overall the film feels lifeless Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity CNN (CNN) -- Dont believe the hype. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan in ""Watchmen"" the film version of the popular graphic novel. ""Visionary"" director Zack Snyder as the marketing would have it has filmed Alan Moores ""unfilmable"" graphic novel by treating the comic book panels as his storyboard and his Bible. Doesnt it bother anyone that this is about as far from the definition of ""visionary"" as its possible to get? The visionary sees what others do not see. Snyder -- whose previous films were a remake (""Dawn of the Dead"") and another scrupulously faithful comic book adaptation (""300"") -- is more in the line of a fancy photocopier duplicating other artists imagery with a forgers intensity. A visionary transforms the world. Snyder slavishly transcribes whats set down 5 inches in front of his face. Alan Moore who has refused to have his name on the movie (ditto its Moore-based predecessors ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") and who has declined all reimbursement to protest the entertainment industrys fundamental lack of respect for intellectual property counts as a bona fide visionary. His 1986 comic book is a landmark in the history of the form a masterpiece of pop cultural angst filtering Cold War nihilism and disillusionment through the inspired pulp idiom of mundane masked crimefighters and one genuine possibly radioactive superhero. In Moores alternative 1985 Nixon is still president the U.S. having won in Vietnam. The Soviets are effectively neutered by Americas not-so-secret weapon Dr. Manhattan a kind of quantum ghost in the machine capable of reconstituting matter (and nuclear warheads) at will. Watch the stars at the premiere >> Dont Miss Stars eagerly await Watchmen release iReport.com Share ""Watchmen"" reviews screening excitement Director Snyder on Watchmen Moores meta-comic switched back and forth in time with the same facility as Dr. Manhattan morphed between New Jersey and Mars cutting between a doomsday conspiracy threatening to engulf the Earth and flashbacks relating the biographies of half-a-dozen ""watchmen"" a generation of intrepid masked avengers forced to hang up their capes and Spandex when public opinion turned on them in the late 1970s. (Its easy to discern the books influence on subsequent films ""The Incredibles"" and ""Mystery Men."") With its parallel stories and virtuoso zooming and panning visual tropes Moore and illustrator Dave Gibbons ""Watchmen"" always felt cinematic. You could sense Martin Scorsese and ""Taxi Drivers"" Travis Bickle in Moores squalid New York and vigilante anti-hero Rorschach but proposed movies by Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass failed to materialize foundering on the comic books sophisticated narrative chicanery. The solution proposed by Snyder and screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse is simply to ignore the problem and stick to the text. In fairness this strategy has proved wildly popular in adaptations of the ""Harry Potter"" books for instance ""Twilight"" and ""300."" The fans seem to demand it -- just as there is now a common assumption that a longer unexpurgated DVD edition is inherently superior to the shorter tighter theatrical version. ""Watchmen"" the movie provides ample evidence that more is more but less might have been closer to Moore in spirit (that is anarchic witty and compelling). Clocking in at an exhausting 163 minutes even without some of the books various subplots the film forfeits momentum and suspense for a jerky succession of expository dialogue scenes interspersed with occasional flashes of grotesque ultra-violence. Its all invariably filmed in Snyders spasmodic stop-go trademark style and accompanied by a jukebox score that ranges from Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen to Nenas ""99 Luftballoons."" On the few occasions where the filmmakers do exercise their imaginations -- in a credit montage relating the glory days of the crimefighters Weegee-style and in a neat improvement on Moores climax -- the results are actually ingenious and sharp. iReport.com Fan underwhelmed by ""Watchmen"" But too many key scenes ring hollow undermined by flat staging and tone-deaf treatment. One of them is the ridiculous moment when Dr. Manhattans faith in humanity is restored by the revelation of ... Well see it for yourself and then compare with the infinitely more nuanced passage in the graphic novel. The considerable limitations of Swedish-Canadian actress Malin Akerman are cruelly exposed as Laurie aka Silk Spectre II and if Matthew Goode (playing Adrian Veidt) is the smartest man in the world then were really in trouble. Jackie Earle Haley and his ""Little Children"" co-star Patrick Wilson fare better as respectively the angry reactionary Rorschach and mildly conflicted Dan Dreiberg while its hard to take your eyes off Billy Crudups naked blue avatar Dr. Manhattan -- for various reasons. I guess an honest reproduction of a great comic book is better than the trivialization that often passes for adaptation and in this case the material is so ingrained with audacious ideas the movie cant be counted a complete cop-out. But if it was really going to honor the original ""Watchmen"" had to put the fear of God in us to rekindle that prospect of imminent nuclear annihilation that haunted the Cold War world. And it had to remind us these rather sorry comic book characters were as Moore insisted more human than super. iReport.com ""Watchmen"" very good but not for kids Snyder flunks that test. Yes it will hit the box office like a tidal wave but ultimately the numb enervating ""Watchmen"" is living on borrowed time. No smiley face here. ""Watchmen"" runs 162 minutes and is rated R.

"Watchmen | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Watchmen Print Page Email Page Search Watchmen (2009; Rated ) C "" Occasionally brilliant often dull."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Watchmen(2009; R)In theaters Friday 6 March 2009 Summary In an alternate 1985 where former superheroes exist the murder of a colleague sends active vigilante Rorschach into his own sprawling investigation uncovering something that could completely change the course of history as we know it. Genre Action Drama Mystery Science Fiction ThrillerDirector Zack Snyder One can imagine two hardcore fans of the ""Watchmen"" graphic novel seeing the movie together sitting side by side barely breathing as they drink in every moment of Zach Snyders adaptation of the Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons classic. They exit the darkness of the theater blinking against the candy-colored bright lights and clanging sounds of the multiplex and they break their silence their instant reviews nearly overlapping ""That was f------ great"" ""What? That was SUCH a piece of s---"" As the fanboys argue a moviegoer who is utterly unfamiliar with the graphic novel is just behind them. She turns to her boyfriend and says ""I dont know WHAT that was all about. I told you we should have seen the Shopaholic movie."" Expect the reactions from fans to mirror the critical take on ""Watchmen."" Some love it some are calling it the first big flop of 2009----and some like me are torn. There are moments of brilliance but at least as many scenes that dive perilously close to camp. For weeks now Ive been hearing from fans who want to know what I thought of the movie. I hate to say Im on the fence because that seems like Im waffling but my honest reaction is that ""Watchmen"" is neither masterpiece nor disaster. Its a splashy mediocrity. (It doesnt help that one of the main characters is played by one of the worst actresses in the world. More on that in a moment.) Director Zach Snyder who transported us to a whole new world with his bloody great adaptation of ""300"" is for the most part faithful to the graphic novel. (Maybe sometimes too faithful. What works on the page doesnt necessarily translate to the big screen.) The best sequence in the entire movie may be the extended opening credits set (unfortunately and far too obviously) to Bob Dylans ""The Times They Are a Changin."" We see how the mask-fighting crime-fighting citizens known as the Minutemen (who eventually become the Watchmen) were formed in 1940s. Their Gumpian adventures include encounters with John F. Kennedy and Andy Warhol among many others. Wearing costumes that look to have been purchased at a Halloween shop they nab the bad guys and pose for publicity shots. Its a great life for the most part. By 1985 however its all gone sour. This is a parallel world in which the United States won the Vietnam War Nixon is apparently president for life and superheroes exist----but the masked avengers have been outlawed. The streets are ugly and dark and rain-splattered. The world is on the brink of nuclear war. Most of the Watchmen have retired gone mad or have faded into irrelevance. (Like former athletes they keep their uniforms on display at home their news clippings framed on the wall.)  The only ones known to the public are the nearly omniscient and super-powerful Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) a glowing blue entity who is usually naked and has become increasingly estranged from his pre-accident human self; and Veidt aka Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) who is the smartest and one of the richest men in the world. Veidt is a good guy who has a plan to save the world. Or is he and does he??? The rest of the Watchmen skulk in the shadows. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley in one of the films best performances) who sounds like Clint Eastwood in ""Gran Torino"" narrates the story from behind his face-blotter mask. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) a cigar-chomping psychopath is murdered by a mysterious figure early in the film but returns for several flashbacks that illustrate his horrific nature. Then theres the Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) who pines for Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) who is in love with Dr. Manhattan but finds it hard to connect with a giant blue glowing creature who has the ability to transport himself to Mars and to halt nuclear warheads but isnt quite up to committing to a relationship. Men. Rorshach is convinced the Comedians murder was no random bit of violence but was only the first act in a plot to kill all the surviving Watchmen. Dr. Manhattan is publicly accused of giving cancer to anyone who gets close to him. Shunned and perplexed he goes off to Mars builds himself some crazy-looking flying machine and pouts while pondering a photo of his human self with the woman he once loved. Meanwhile Nite Owl and Silk Spectre fire up the old flying machine don the superhero costumes rescue citizens from a burning building and then have some hot sex. We also get flashbacks involving the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino who also shows up in the 1980s with some not-convincing old-age makeup) Rorshachs Dickensian childhood the accident that turned a nice scientist into Dr. Manhattan (these scientists really need to be more careful in their labs) and more. About 90 minutes into it with Dr. Manhattan arguing with Silk Spectre on Mars a dwarf in prison threatening to kill Rorshach and actors made up to look like Nixon and Kissinger debating whether we should go to war with Russia youre wondering where are we going and when are we going to get there? The violence in ""Watchmen"" isnt as wall-to-wall as it was in ""300"" but there a couple of particularly brutal scenes one involving an attempted rape and the other showing a child-killer getting his just due. Snyders visuals are rarely boring but some of the CGI stuff is surprisingly cheesy----most notably the sequences on Mars. Like the film itself the casting is uneven. Haleys growling pit bull act works well but Wilson is bland and slightly reminiscent of Adam Wests Batman as the Nite Owl. And Crudup a fine actor is buried beneath the special effects and reduced to monotone line readings as Dr. Manhattan. In a film I loved called ""The Lookout"" Matthew Goode gave one of the most underrated performances in recent years. Please rent it. Here as Ozymandias who is supposed to be so smart and so fast and so dangerous Goode comes across like the backup singer in a boy band. Hes all foppish fopphishness and he seems about as lethal as a fashion designer bitching out a model backstage. And then theres Malin Akerman as Silk Spectre. Im sure Ms. Akerman is a nice young lady but having seen her in ""27 Dresses"" ""The Heartbreak Kid"" and here Im not so sure acting is the career for her. Her delivery is so flat that it would compel an acting teacher at a community college to say ""Have you thought about becoming a nurse?"" Whether shes learning a shocking secret fighting with Dr. Manhattan or doing it with the Nite Owl she sounds as if shes reciting lines she just memorized. Its painful to watch. The graphic novel ""Watchmen"" is such a dark densely layered and yes cinematic work of art that it feels like youre immersed in a movie as you experience it. But the advantage of the book is you can pause and go back a few pages or take a moment to consider the ramifications of the flashbacks (and the flashbacks within the flashbacks). You can take your time perusing the frames for small touches. With a movie it just washes over you. If you dont know these characters from the novel youre going to have a hell of time keeping up with their multi-decade soap opera. Theres also the matter of timing. After ""Iron Man"" and ""The Hulk"" and of course ""The Dark Knight"" not to mention ""Hancock"" and even ""Wanted"" we have seen some good and even great movies about men and women who have been cursed with great gifts. Theyre conflicted to their very cores. Even as they try to save humanity theyre feeling less and less human and theyre unable to have anything resembling a normal life. So it goes with ""Watchmen."" Nobody ever smiles unless its in flashbacks when they were all human. Its been a long time since the first ""Spider-Man"" when Peter Parker was at least initially giddy when he realized the things he could do. Someone needs to start a Superhero Support Group. These people/gods on Earth need some serious cheering up.

Review Watchmen Alan Moores 12-part graphic novel ""Watchmen"" originally published in single issues in 1986-87 by DC Comics has been on the Hollywood radar for decades. Now that its finally here - and from the director who gave us ""300"" no less - the question is Will anyone but comic-book geeks flock to it?Not being one of the tribe I can only report that ""Watchmen"" left me looking at the exit far more often than at the screen. Set in a bizarro universe of 1985 where Richard Nixon remains president and the cold war is reheating its about the Watchmen a race of costumed superheroes - theyre more like supervigilantes - who come out of hiding in a world where they have been banned by Nixon. (The plot machinations are much more baroquely detailed than this but you get the idea.) Included in the lineup are the hyperblond Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) who bills himself as ""the smartest man in the world""; Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) who seems to be trying to outdo Uma Thurman in ""Kill Bill""; Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who looks like what Mr. Clean might resemble if he joined the Blue Man Group; The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) whose garish death in the opening scenes is served up for our delectation; and Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) whose inkblot face mask is the most expressive thing in the movie. Although the films visuals are a cut above say ""Sin City"" another serioso graphic novel-turned-movie it has the same mood a film-noir-ish soddenness punctuated by megaviolence. ""Watchmen"" is the anti-""Incredibles."" Grade C- (Rated R for strong graphic violence sexuality nudity and language.)

Warner Bros. By Joe Morgenstern Updated March 6 2009 1201 a.m. ET ""Watchmen"" presents two great challenges -- getting your mind around it and getting your head out from under it. The first was to be expected. The source material a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons is a work of unusual intricacy visual power and narrative ambition. Doing full justice to such a classic in a single movie was clearly impossible though hundreds of artists and technicians led by the director Zack Snyder -- his previous film was the violent Spartan morality saga ""300"" -- have reverently moved great dollops of the book to the big screen. The second is essential to sustaining sanity. Unless youre heavily invested -- as countless fans and fervent fanboys are -- in the novels flawed superheroes its jaundiced take on heroism and its alternate vision of American history watching ""Watchmen"" is the spiritual equivalent of being whacked on the skull for 163 minutes. The reverence is inert the violence noxious the mythology murky the tone grandiose the texture glutinous. Its an alternate version of ""The Incredibles"" minus the delight. The story starts with the brutal murder of a brutish antihero called ""The Comedian"" then quickly turns into a paranoid thriller as a crazed vigilante Rorschach searches for the killer and uncovers an apocalyptic plot. (Rorschach wears a mask with inkblots swirling beneath its surface and narrates in voice-over sounding like a nut job Batman besotted by Raymond Chandler. Hes played by Jackie Earle Haley who is genuinely frightening on the few occasions when he sheds his mask.) The film like the novel leaps back and forth in time and space -- one dreamy interlude takes place on Mars -- but the action is set mainly in the parallel universe of a 1980s America where the Cold War has reached the boiling point the doomsday clock is approaching midnight and formerly prominent superheroes have woven themselves into the warp and woof -- especially the warp given their foibles -- of everyday life. That setting is amusing up to a point. A Cyrano-nosed Richard Nixon is serving a fifth term in the White House. A Henry Kissinger growlalike sports a Slavic accent. Buckets of bombast are hurled by talking heads who bear a not-so-witty resemblance to John McLaughlin Pat Buchanan and Eleanor Clift. Yet an all-pervasive joylessness makes it impossible to care about the big costumed cheeses who will or will not save the world from nuclear annihilation -- Patrick Wilsons Nite Owl (dont blame Mr. Wilson who actually does some acting); Malin Akermans statuesque Silk Spectre (""Omigod"" she chirps during that interlude ""were on Mars""); Matthew Goodes supersmart Ozymandias (he gets smart-alecky lines like ""Im not a comic-book villain"") and Billy Crudups godlike Dr. Manhattan (the only one who possesses true superpowers and the only one displayed in slightly abstracted frontal nudity though who cares because hes detached from humanity). Graphic The making of Dr. Manhattan Dave Gibbons Unlike ""300"" which combined live-action characters with computer-generated sets this film uses physical settings too and its all to the good; the production as a whole is impressive. So is the eclectic soundtrack which ranges from Philip Glass and Leonard Cohen to Bob Dylan (performed by Jimi Hendrix) and Paul Simon. (""The Sounds of Silence"" plays over a haunting scene in a Brooklyn cemetery). At the same time the martial arts along with some crucial special effects are inelegant to say the least. But then elegance isnt Zack Snyders bag; a certain sort of impact is. ""Watchmen"" establishes him as Hollywoods reigning master of psychic suffocation. Everlasting Moments ""Not everyone is endowed with the gift of seeing"" a camera store owner tells a winsome customer in ""Everlasting Moments."" Hes flirting with her -- this is Sweden at the turn of the 20th century when feelings can barely be expressed -- but hes also telling the truth. The shy young wife and mother Maria Larsson has discovered her gift through a little folding camera -- a Contessa -- that she won in a lottery. This exquisite film by the Swedish master Jan Troell is about seeing clearly and fearlessly. Its also about subdued passion the birth of an artist and a womans struggle to live her own life. Maria a country girl from Finland and an unlikely vessel for feminist stirrings is played by the Finnish actress Maria Heiskanen who is self-effacing precise to the point of austerity and quietly astonishing; she doesnt seem to be acting at all. Mikael Persbrandt is Marias volcanic husband Sigfrid a dock worker boozer womanizer and occasional wife-beater who is jealous of his wifes camera as well he might be and whose head swirls with vague ambitions. Jesper Christensen as the amorous camera-store proprietor Sebastian Pedersen makes longing palpable; its Pedersens fate to send Maria down a new life path but not to accompany her. As you might expect of a movie thats entranced with photography Mr. Troells camera like Marias captures memorable images a streetcar looming out of the fog on a snowy night a violinist serenading a dog a child venturing onto an icy lake then disappearing in a mist; a moths wing projected by a hand-held lens onto Marias palm. The story covers a lot of ground gracefully self-discovery domestic violence labor strife the slow climb up from poverty -- in a rare moment of simple fun Maria watches Charlie Chaplin in ""Easy Street"" -- and against heavy odds the emergence of love. The mood is often ruminative and the rhythms sometimes slow -- Ive heard detractors joke that the films title should have been shortened to ""Everlasting."" Watch closely though and you see that the filmmaker takes life in just as Maria does with darting piercing glances. While his narrative structure seems stately in comparison to commercial productions that clamor for attention at every moment his work within individual scenes is as lively as it is laconic -- time sliced thin into kinetic snapshots. And why shouldnt ""Everlasting Moments"" take as much time as it needs? It isnt set in the digital age but in the bygone days of photographs on film when things developed slowly. Phoebe in Wonderland ENLARGE Elle Fanning in Phoebe in Wonderland. IFC Films Elle Fanning plays a child who suffers from being special in Daniel Barnzs ""Phoebe in Wonderland."" Phoebes specialness looks a lot like obsessive-compulsive disorder but no one is so coarse as to call it that and the poor kids mother who is working on a book about Wonderland is in denial. Rather shes In Denial since its that kind of movie full of therapeutic notions paraded as poetry and scenes that seem to carry explanatory labels as when Phoebes mother played with fulsome intensity by Felicity Huffman tells her daughters shrink ""Your profession just doesnt want kids to be kids"" or when her father played with rote obtuseness by Bill Pullman says to her mother ""Just out of curiosity how am I supposed to care about your work if you dont?"" (Just out of curiosity how are we supposed to care about her work when the movie doesnt give us a clue about her books substance?) At the age of 10 (and 11 months) Elle Fanning is already a remarkable actress I was going to say performer but what she does here is skillful appealing acting. (Credit for that should be shared by Mr. Barnz who is making his feature debut.) And any movie with Patricia Clarkson has my attention from her very first scene. In this one she plays Miss Dodger a mysteriously wise semi-mythical drama teacher who puts on a school production of ""Alice in Wonderland"" and liberates Phoebe in the process. Not even she however can save a movie that suffers from terminal self-enchantment. DVD Focus ENLARGE Watchmen The Complete Motion Comic (2009) Its fascinating to watch this animated version after the live-action sensory assault on the big screen. The tone is solemn the figures move slowly -- theyre panel-for-panel reproductions of the book in extremely limited animation -- and one actor Tom Stechschulte does all the voices male and female in an unaffected almost uninflected style. Yet the colors are dazzling at least on the Blu-ray disk that arrived a few days ago and the effect is hypnotic. You not only see clearly but feel strongly since those colors words and images all carry emotion and theres ample time to process it. ENLARGE Under Fire (1983) The photojournalist played by Nick Nolte uses a film camera too but hes a long way from turn-of-the-century Sweden. Roger Spottiswoode directed this smart engrossing drama about three journalists -- the others played by Gene Hackman and Joanna Cassidy -- in Nicaragua just before Somozas fall in 1979. The cinematographer John Alcott was renowned for creating superb images with minimal lighting. I watched him shoot a close-up of Gene Hackman in a high-contrast setting -- a backlit alley -- with nothing to relieve the shadows on the actors face but a Boy Scout flashlight. The shot looked perfect on screen. ENLARGE Pieces of April (2003) Patricia Clarkson was her usual self -- maximally marvelous -- in Peter Hedgess fine minimalist film that evolves from a comedy of alienation to a drama of acceptance and reconciliation. Katie Holmes stars as April the black sheep of an eccentric family. Ms. Clarkson is Aprils mother Joy whose illness casts a pall on a family dinner though not that much of a pall because the actress manages to make her both world-weary and deliciously droll. Oliver Platt is Aprils father and Derek Luke is her boyfriend Bobby a black man eager to please a white family. -- Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Comic Books Movies Entertainment News I went into the screening of ""Watchmen"" all set to write one of those high-minded critical screeds about how Hollywood always screws up comic-book movies and how the better the comic book is the worse the cinematic results are. Successful comic-based flicks seem to come in only two flavors both of them fundamentally adolescent the binary good-vs.-evil teen-romance world of the ""Spider-Man"" movies or the stylized neo-noir darkness of Christopher Nolans Batman films. Last year I joked that it would be great to see a superhero movie that was actually set in a grimy realistic morally bewildering universe instead of an art-directed simulacrum thereof. What if Batman was in ""The French Connection""?Last year I hadnt seen ""Watchmen."" Im shocked to be writing this given the number of screenwriters directors and studios this adaptation of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ground-breaking 1986 anti-superhero comic series has gone through but ""Watchmen"" is absolutely devastating. Dense intense tragic and visionary this is the kind of movie that keeps setting off bombs in your brain hours after youve seen it. After coming out of the theater I wandered the frozen streets of Manhattan watching passersby and wondering which was the real city the apparently peaceful one I inhabit now or the one that faces Armageddon at the mid-80s height of the Cold War in the Moore-Gibbons universe. If I could have gone back inside and watched the movie all over again Id have done it.Although he was easily the least promising of the directors attached to this project over the years -- which have included Terry Gilliam Paul Greengrass and Darren Aronofsky -- Zack Snyder (of ""300"" and the 2004 ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake) reveals himself here as a filmmaker of mightily impressive range and control. For my money ""Watchmen"" way out-darks ""The Dark Knight"" and immediately leaps near the top of the list of apocalyptic pop-culture operas alongside ""Blade Runner"" and the first ""Matrix"" movie (which are obvious influences). My instinct is that this may be too gloomy grinding and un-cathartic a film to provide a Bat-scale global payday and to his immense credit Snyder has insisted he wont be involved with any sequel.A sequel may well be made of course but I dont see how you do it and avoid pointlessness and self-parody. ""Watchmen"" is not the story of the triumphant reunion of a band of superheroes after all but of its final implosion and self-destruction. Not all the Watchmen survive the film and the world may have reason to be grateful for that. (Im on dangerous turf here I realize.) One of the films central characters a man called Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is a rage-filled right-wing sociopath something like Travis Bickle in a mottled mask and a trenchcoat. Another Watchman known as the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is a rapist and remorseless killer who specializes in knocking off Latin American leftist regimes for the CIA. Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) the onetime Ozymandias is an unctuous energy zillionaire with faintly troubling utopian visions who styles himself after Ramses II the all-conquering Egyptian pharaoh.More powerful still is the trans-dimensional Nietzschean superman called Dr. Manhattan (voiced by Billy Crudup) a nude figure of variable size who resembles a blue translucent version of the Oscar statuette. Hes being used by the United States government as a one-man missile defense system while President Richard Nixon (whos beginning his fifth term in 1985) edges ever closer to launching a preemptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. But in that context Dr. Manhattans cosmic consciousness is none too comforting. As he puts it life itself is an abstract and perhaps meaningless concept and he can discern no molecular difference between living bodies and dead ones.OK there are people to root for more or less against the impending A-bomb clouds and Snyders dizzying thrilling montage sequences one of which outlines the hilariously tawdry tradition of masked crime-fighting vigilantes and another of which offers an alternate version of recent American history. The Comedian killed JFK it appears and followed that up a decade later by taking out Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. The Viet Cong surrendered to Dr. Manhattan in person and Vietnam is now the 51st state. Among the films cameo characters are Pat Buchanan Ted Koppel Lee Iacocca Andy Warhol Henry Kissinger and Nixon himself played by Robert Wisden as a jowly tyrant who still possesses buried deep inside a gram or two of humanity.But even the heroes of ""Watchmen"" are muddled people more than a little frustrated and disappointed in themselves. Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) used to be Rorschachs partner a sub-Batman crime-fighter called Nite Owl. Involuntarily retired along with all other superheroes by a 1977 act of Congress Dans now a rumpled middle-aged nebbish who lives alone. Hes still haunted by his unconsummated passion for Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) aka Silk Spectre who is Dr. Manhattans lover and pretty much his only remaining tie to the human race. If theres any conventional redemption to be found in ""Watchmen"" it lies in Dan and Laurie rediscovering themselves and each other. You Might Also Like As readers of the Moore-Gibbons ""Watchmen"" will recognize thats also true in the comic book. Indeed whatever liberties Snyder and his screenwriters may have taken the film remains strikingly loyal to the governing spirit of Moores graphic novel and incorporates large dollops of its scene-by-scene dialogue. Most impressively Snyder has translated into film the aspects of Moores work that are most difficult to explain or to capture its combination of epic grandiosity and Scorsesean dirty realism along with what you might call its atheism. Inescapably the context for ""Watchmen"" is different 22 years after its initial publication -- in 1986 the world really did face nuclear catastrophe or so it seemed -- but the story retains much of its startling stringent potency as the first (and nearly only) superhero comic to turn its back on the genres ahistorical and quasi-fascistic Great Man idolatry.As those who have followed this films long gestation know Snyder has blended two different screenplays one from the early 90s by David Hayter and a more recent version by Alex Tse. And yes as you have probably heard Moores ending has been adjusted or streamlined or whatever Hollywood euphemism you prefer. Im going to write something very brief about that ending in just a second in a way that really ought not to spoil it for most viewers. Moore fans will know about this already and it wont mean anything to those who havent read the comic books. But Im still going to give you another sentence or two to close your computer in a cold sweat or click over to War Room or Cary Tennis or something.OK are you ready? You sure? Last chance Here goes Theres no giant squid. To the long list of movies that dont have a giant squid in them -- ""Mars Needs Women"" ""Nashville"" and Kieslowskis ""Decalogue"" all come to mind -- you can add this one. But listen Im not going to tell you what Snyder and the writers have put in there instead of a giant squid. I wont drop coy hints or anything. Ill just add one completely heretical observation It works better this way. The squid was kind of dumb. You may also know that Moores name appears nowhere in the credits for Snyders ""Watchmen"" and that hes vowed to give all his royalties to Gibbons (who is credited as ""co-creator"" of the DC Comics title). Moore is of course correct that every other movie version of his work has been total bollocks and its somehow fitting that the one he completely disavows is the one that gets it right. Ive made it clear by this point that I think ""Watchmen"" is a terrific comic-book movie the most completely satisfying and unsettling one Ive ever seen. I also feel pretty sure that its reviews will be all over the map and that at least some viewers will be profoundly turned off by the bitterness and bleakness of this movies vision. Youll notice I havent done that movie-critic thing of pulling the actors into the spotlight one by one discussing their signature moments the set of their jawlines the breathtaking humanity of their emotions. Well Im with Dr. Manhattan on this one. Who cares about humanity?No actually I think some of the performances in ""Watchmen"" are excellent notably Haley as Rorschach and Morgan as the Comedian the two thoroughly reprehensible superheroes who are nonetheless devoted to living and dying by their code. But this is a grandiose director-driven spectacle a visual and auditory construction after the fashion of Stanley Kubrick and nominally central characters like Dan and Laurie while engaging enough are undeniably overshadowed. I could engage in some kind of debate with the shadow of Pauline Kael right here -- topic What are movies and what is their purpose? -- but lets sum it all up by admitting that ""Watchmen"" is an ingenious bloody-minded and sometimes coldhearted contraption and how you feel about that is an individual matter.That said I think Snyder and his writers channel moments of the humanity and humor thats always present in Moores work. When Laurie/Silk Spectre finally leaves Dr. Manhattan and ends up on Dan/Nite Owls sofa -- in point of fact straddling Dan on Dans sofa -- and the object of years of lust and adoration from afar is finally within the one-time Nite Owls reach he suffers a fate familiar to many men but admitted by few. He cant get it up. She tells him its all right and of course its not really. Somehow I dont think that ever happens to the Man of Steel. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Me By Sara Vilkomerson  03/05/09 955pm In the spirit of full disclosure I should be upfront about my feelings on the whole Watchmen hullabaloo I wanted no part of it (and not just because I used to cohabitate with a seriously rabid Watchmen fan ... you know the kind who keeps the book by the bedside table babbling about dystopia and deconstructing-the-superhero and government unease and who-will-watch-the-watchmen and shut up its 3.a.m. and etc). Dont get me wrong I love a good comic-book movie but there was just something about this one that made me deeply anxious. Alternate reality? A doomsday clock? By the 300 guy (Zach Snyder)? Ack But once I settled down in my seat and the opening credits rolled I started to think that maybe I had it all wrong. Because honestly? Those opening credits were just about the coolest opening credits Ive ever seen But the problem is that after the opening credits were over there wasnt a whole lot to get excited about. As someone unfamiliar with the Watchmen universe its a little hard to catch up with the mythology of this thing which frankly seems a little complicated The basics theres a gang of costumed superheroes walking around in a 1985 America that still has Nixon as president and the threat of nuclear war with the Soviet Union is imminent. We have Little Childrens Patrick Wilson as Night Owl--a rather wussy man with lots of expensive toys; Jackie Earle Haley as a redheaded sociopath named Rorschach (sounding like Christian Bale in Dark Knight); dead Denny from Greys Anatomy as the violent and not-so-funny Comedian; Malin Ackerman as some weird long-haired thing we couldnt figure out (and who earned the funniest of slams in a particularly awesome Anthony Lane review in this weeks New Yorker); and our would-be-boyfriend Matthew Goode almost unrecognizable in blond hair and kind of doing a David Bowie circa Labyrinth kind of affect. Oh there is also a giant blue naked man named Dr. Manhattan who used to be Billy Crudup but now glows and smiles serenely and often forgets to wear pants and can vaporize just about anything. His giant blue flaccid penis is very distracting. Heres the good news the movie is lovely to look at in an incredibly stylized kind of way (though really it cant rain all the time like a November Rain video right?).  If theres one thing Ive heard its that the movie is faithful to the book--perhaps too faithful? It wasnt that I wasnt engaged in some of the (many) story lines its just that there was never enough time spent with any particular one to so as to become emotionally involved ... which seem strange to say about a movie 165 minutes long. Thats right 165 minutes long These are three hours I will never get back. In addition to the length I truly did not enjoy what seemed to be the over-the-top violence. Do we need to see dogs ripping at a little girls leg (read no)? Same goes with the rather oddly staged sex scene ... too much and too weird and it all left me feeling was that this movie did not intend itself to be seen by someone like me. Im the wrong gender and about fifteen years too old. I am quite curious to see what people will think of this movie. One thing is for certain ... I cant imagine seeing Dr. Manhattan in all his naked glory in IMAX Comment Filed under Billy Crudup Film Matthew Goode movie Patrick Wilson Watchmen Zach Snyder Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://observer.com/2009/03/who-watched-iwatchmeni-me/,200,watchmen7,watchmen,com/2009/03/who-watched-iwatchmeni-me/

This nugget from Oscar Wilde is worth keeping in mind when tussling with the state of the superhero as depicted in ""Watchmen"" director Zack Snyders bold interpretation of the DC Comics 1986 graphic novel. Certainly Wilde would get no argument from Rorschach the movies particularly bitter masked adventurer. A member of a one-time collection of crime fighters called the Minutemen Rorschach wears a white-cloth mask with inkblots that undulate as he rasps his judgments on society.  RATING | Graphic Novel Flick And hes got em. Its his pitiless diary entries that introduce audiences to the sorry state of the human condition in 1985 and also strike the films alienated tone. ""All the whores and politicians will look up and shout Save us and Ill look down and whisper No. "" In the mid-80s British comic genius Alan Moore and illustrator David Gibbons took the pervasive anxiety created by two superpowerswith nukes and spun it into a paranoid tale about humans who donned masks to keep faith with the American dream. Only to have America break faith with them. ""Watchmen"" is a two-hour 42 minute ride through a dystopian scape with appropriately twisting and conflicted story lines. One tracks Rorschach and former colleagues Nite Owl Ozymandias and Silk Spectre II as they begin to believe they are targets of a masked hero-killer. The other concerns a world on the brink. The film opens with dark verve upon a killing choreographed to Nat King Coles ""Unforgettable."" The mood Snyder strikes as Edward Blake a.k.a. the Comedian fights for his life against a masked foe is edgy. ""Watchmen"" moves from past to present with a wary scary eye to an apocalyptic future. There are character-revealing flashbacks and jarring visions of what lies ahead. This is a fittingly fluid approach. After all Dr. Manhattan the movies lone employed superhero (the others have been outlawed) can see into the future. What he gleans is not promising. The Cold War tango of the Soviet Union and the U.S. has pushed the big hand on the Doomsday Clock forward. Its five minutes to midnight and mutually assured destruction. Having done away with term limits President Richard Nixon is contemplating a response to the Soviets invasion of Afghanistan. U.S. superweapon Dr. Manhattan is distracted by relationship drama and other concerns. Years earlier a lab mishap altered the physicist. Except for lover Laurie Jupiter hes less connected to humankind. But oh what he can do with atoms. Blue-tinted and bald Dr. Manhattan/Jon Osterman is played by Billy Crudup with a solemn flatness that has moments of surprisingly tender regret. His nudity is one of the reasons for the films R rating. Dr. Manhattans mood is blue too. And one of the movies finest sequences comes as the melancholy Manhattan teleports himself to Mars to get away from humans. Like many of the tarnished superheroes of recent vintage those in ""Watchmen"" carry baggage. Dr. Manhattan has a gift he didnt ask for. Rorschachs mother helped singe his view of the world. Silk Spectre II hated the departed Comedian who assaulted her mother when they were Minutemen together. The vexing (albeit leggy) problem with ""Watchmen"" is Malin Akermans turn as Laurie Jupiter/ Silk Spectre II. As Dr. Manhattans paramour her character is the hinge between the human and the superhuman. Yet her performance is frustratingly betwixt and between and not just because her character is torn between Dr. Manhattan and the pining smart- sexy Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson). Carla Gugino provides one of the movies best performances as the original Silk Spectre. The actress displays a rich grasp of the pleasures and pitfalls of being an original costumed crime-fighter. She has an even better time depicting the hard-bitten tippling retiree. These angst-driven superheroes join a burgeoning pop-culture confederacy that includes Christian Bales Dark Knight Will Smiths sloppy drunken and surly Hancock even ""Iron Man"" billionaire Tony Stark. All could use couch time with a trained analyst. Instead they opt for crime-fighting. Whether their communities want their services or not. Leave it to the guys playing the darker roles to deliver with unsettling bravado. Jackie Earle Haleys Rorschach and Jeffrey Dean Morgans Comedian capture all the ugliness at the heart of this darkness and spit it back at us.

Star Tribune Billy Crudup in The Watchmen Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Sure ""Watchmen"" was the ""Moby Dick"" of superhero graphic novels teeming with big themes multifaceted characters and epic adventure. On the page the tales crazy salad of world-weary crime busters adolescent nihilism pulp bloodshed and political paranoia captivated a generation of fans. Who could resist a comic book with the audacity to implicate a masked avenger for the JFK assassination? On the screen however the overpacked story loses focus. Its dystopia with myopia. The writer of the ""Watchmen"" comics Alan Moore disavows all film adaptations of his work. Movies like this are why. At root ""Watchmen"" is a murder mystery set in a bleak alternative 1985. Richard Nixon is in his fifth term a superhero-led U.S. victory in Vietnam sparked a huge Russian arms buildup and the world is on the verge of nuclear annihilation. In a worst-case New York as dark as ""Blade Runners"" hellish metropolis the cynical antihero known as the Comedian is murdered. After a bone-crunching fight all thats left of him is entrails on the sidewalk 30 floors below his apartment and a bloodstained smiley-face pin. The film goes splat too -- and takes an interminable two and three-quarter hours to do it. The Comedians onetime colleagues officially banned by the Anti-Mask Laws regroup to find their comrades killers. ""Watchmens"" justice league is a splintered band working at cross-purposes with little in common but their psychological scars. Theres the bullied unloved tenement kid who became Rorschach a sadistic misanthrope who uses his righteousness as a license to inflict pain. Danger-seeking Silk Spectre II a second-generation wonder woman has traumatic conflicts with her alcoholic mother. Nite Owl II a sheepish nonentity in daily life gets a kinky erotic charge out of dressing in vinyl and bloodying street thugs. A tragic accident turned a genial physicist into the godlike Dr. Manhattan erasing his emotional connection with humanity in the process. Uber-genius Ozymandias claims the right to impose his will on ignorant mankind for our own good. Not one has a healthy love life. Even omniscient Dr. Manhattan is baffled by his lover Silk Spectres needs and his own urge toward infidelity. After she dumps him he exiles himself to Mars turning his back on Earths nuclear crisis. These characters want to save the world but cant set their own hearts right. As their investigation pushes forward the tale veers down a hundred tangents. Narrative point of view changes hands faster than a basketball as back stories unfurl the location leaps from Antarctica to outer space and Henry Kissinger channels ""Dr. Strangelove."" WATCHMEN  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong graphic violence sexuality nudity and language. Moores overarching theme is that caped superheroes are reflections of Americas political ideology (you may have noticed theres no Captain Europe). The Comedian a reactionary thug wields a flamethrower against the Viet Cong while omnipotent Dr. Manhattan evaporates adversaries with blasts of radiation. They embody the national impulse to fight in the name of eradicating terror rather than bringing peace thus fanning the flames of hatred. Smug Ozymandias with his designs for a new world order of limitless free energy is a nightmare of patronizing liberalism. Only Nite Owl and Silk Spectre do-gooders of moderate temperament offer a hope of harmony. Thats a rich subtext. The problem comes in dramatizing it. After an exciting night of heroism the Spectre and the Owl couple in his flying machine to Leonard Cohens religious-romantic ballad ""Hallelujah."" The over-reverent score the earnest groping by actors Malin Ackerman and Patrick Wilson and director Zack Snyders soft-porn photography make this an early contender for Worst Movie Sex Scene of 2009. Second-worst? The Samp;M rape scene between Jeffrey Dean Morgans Comedian and Carla Guginos Silk Spectre I. The film also offers candidates for third through fifth. The film is a looker to be sure with every bone shard and dog carcass and fireball and spike of splintered glass art-directed to glossy perfection. And some of the parts are ideally cast. Jackie Earle Haley is searingly good as the runtish revengeful Rorschach even when hes growling out purple-prose narration like ""This awful city it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children."" But the slavishly literal adaptation expires from narrative bloat. Peter Jackson kept the spirit of ""The Lord of the Rings"" alive by slashing Tolkiens text. ""Watchmen"" bites off more than a single film can chew and chokes on its gluttony. Ths film repeatedly shows us graffiti asking ""Who will watch The Watchmen?""

Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures Dark Knight Back in the day The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) hid a mean streak behind that heros mask. Warner Bros. Pictures On Set With The Watchmen Character Portraits This weeks big movie -- Watchmen a 12-part DC Comics series turned graphic novel and now turned film -- opens with a nervous but hopeful fan base preparing to turn out in droves. Rumors have swirled about story changes for more than a year; then just before the movies scheduled release a rights dispute threatened to land Watchmen in court rather than in theaters. Now its out though and its ... well its quite a picture. The title sequence in Watchmen arguably the films smartest four minutes welcomes us to an alternate 1985. Richard Nixon has begun his fifth term as president and partly because hes outlawed costumed superheroes the world is a messy place on the verge of nuclear war. As the titles end one thoroughly unpleasant guy who once wore the spandex -- he called himself The Comedian and he still sports a signature smiley-face button -- gets a late-night knock at the door. Well not a knock really. His door gets kicked in and a sort of aerial fisticuffs ballet ensues -- a battle that sends him crashing around his high-rise apartment through walls and cabinets and finally out the window in a fatal 40-story back-dive. Tuck position I think. Id give him about a 3 for execution but its flashy in that digitally unreal way you expect in superhero epics. The Comedians death prompts a reunion of five vigilant vigilantes who were his buds back when costumes were legal. Theres a fellow named Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) whose mask has constantly moving blotches; Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) a nebbishy gadget nut; Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) allegedly the smartest guy in the world; Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) a raven-haired beauty who looks like a walking shampoo ad; and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) a onetime physicist whos been demolecularized in a lab accident which both gave him superpowers and turned him blue. As he lacks a spandex suit -- or for the most part a suit of any sort -- full-frontal shots of him also qualify as blue come to think of it. Collectively Dr. Manhattan and his less ""super"" super-buddies -- their powers otherwise seem to start and end with martial arts prowess -- were once known as Watchmen. And in Alan Moores graphic novel theyre intriguing as a sort of collective deconstruction of the very notion of superherodom. The moviemakers though are too busy digitizing ice castles on Mars to bother with much in the way of meta. Or personalities. So the characters make do with the kind of complicated backstories that are just riveting in graphic novels. Alas backstories tend to clutter up a movie especially when there are six of them to get through. So director Zack Snyder is still doling out origin flashbacks two hours and seven minutes into his little epic. Mind you the movie has almost 40 minutes to go at that point. Most of them will take place in what looks to be a cross between The Mummys tomb and Supermans frozen Fortress of Solitude where catastrophic scenarios will be debated at length. Ill leave you to discover how all that works out. For the record the director recycles some of the better effects from his gladiator epic 300 -- that 40-story back dive for instance. And when hes not splattering blood a good deal more liberally than he needs to hes being so faithful to the work of comics artist Dave Gibbons that he might as well have used the graphic novels illustrations as a storyboard. This will no doubt seem a good thing to really rabid Watchmen fans but its going to leave everyone else wondering if the director knows much about movie pacing or movie narratives. Or movie audiences. Related NPR Stories From Page To Screen Watchmen Arrives D.O.A.

Seeing a movie made from a favorite novel or even an ordinary one the reader-viewer invariably finds something missing lacking overstressed or just plain wrong because it was changed. When we read the book we make the movie we cast it visualize it control its pacing. We own it. Any other version of the book -- say Hollywoods -- competes with our original experience and simply cant measure up. And this applies no matter how good the film how bad the book. If thered been a cheapo novel called Citizen Kane that preceded the movie somebody whod read it first would have said ""Nice try but its not MY Citizen Kane."" (TIMEs Lev Grossman a devout Watchmen fan sizes up the movie. Listen to the podcast) So who would have the gigantic steel cojones to make a movie of Watchmen? Written by Alan Moore illustrated by Dave Gibbons and colored by John Higgins the serialized comic book came out in 1986. This was the pre-Internet age -- Moore pounded out his scripts on a manual typewriter -- when most comics had an afterlife only in the back-issue bins. Yet Watchmen quickly achieved status as the Grail the Bible the Citizen Bob Kane of its medium. (TIME canonized it as one of the 100 best novels since 1923.) And it continues to expand its reach. Last fall Gibbons put out the latte-table book Watching the Watchmen. The story is also available on DVD in ""moving comics"" form 5 hours and 25 minutes of very limited animation of the drawings with a narrator reading the text and dialogue. There is also you may have heard a movie version that opens Friday. (See pictures of the Watchmen.) From the start of the Watchmen cult film people knew two things about the comic book (1) that it simply had to be made into a movie and (2) that it couldnt. An epic superhero saga spanning 45 years with six major characters who all sport double identities and crucial intertwined back-stories does not lend itself to the narrative turbo-thrust of a standard action film. Indeed the superest hero of the bunch -- Dr. Manhattan once known as Jon Osterman -- is not an action hero; hes a passive one a contemplative godhead a sinewy blue nude Buddha emotionally removed from the comics central whodunit quest Who killed Eddie Blake? A.k.a. the Comedian. Complicating this is the possessiveness felt by hardcore Watchmaniacs who believe that any change is an act of treason. When director Zack Snyder showed clips of the movie last fall to an audience of rapt but wary votaries one portly fellow told him ""On behalf of the obese-obsessive demographic I want your assurance that the ending does not puss out."" Such is the snakebite of hype especially for a project with such outsize expectations. The film budgeted at 100 million and the object of a rights wrangle between Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox has received less than rapturous early reviews. In his Hollywood Reporter critique Kirk Honeycutt predicted that the film would be ""the first real flop of 2009."" (See the top 10 graphic novels.) Thats the dilemma the director faced to risk disappointing both the fan base (for diverting from the sacred text) and the agnostic mass audience (for being a confusing unsatisfying movie experience). Snyder -- who had a big hit two years ago with 300 and who took Watchmen on after interesting auteurs from Terry Gilliam in the 80s to Paul Greengrass a few years ago fell out -- went with the fan base. He worked from a script written in 2001 by David Hayter and filigreed by Alex Tse that was as close to the original as a movie could be. The best and worst thing to say about the Watchmen film is that if you read the book the movie you made in your head probably looked a lot like this. Should a real Watchmen fan see the movie?

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Watchmen click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Watchmen Watchmen (Warner Bros.) Zack Snyders long-awaited adaptation of the seminal 1986 graphic novel written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons shows an acolytes respect for the sacred text on which its based. The film is slavishly true to the letter of the book with a few exceptions Moores use of nested narratives--interpolated text from imaginary books and newspapers comics being read within comics--has been streamlined into a single master story line. But the books spirit--its paranoia its dark humor and above all its bleak anti-triumphalism--has been squelched in the transition to a big-budget action epic. Watchmen fans wondering whether their graphic novel has been ruined will be thrilled to see its key scenes reproduced with storyboardlike fidelity but those whove never read it will be unlikely to understand what the big deal was in the first place. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. What was the big deal? In his analysis of the singular place Watchmen  occupies in the comic-book canon Grady Hendrix points to two elements that set the series apart. First there was the multimedia Chinese-box format. But more importantly Watchmen was morally ambiguous to a then-unprecedented degree. Its heroes werent (like the Batman of the Dark Knight series or late-era Spider-Man) towering superbeings struggling with Hamlet-like inner demons. They were ordinary struggling screwed-up Joes who for motives ranging from daddy issues to out-and-out sociopathology felt compelled to put on suits and practice ill-considered mayhem. Advertisement Watchmen the film kicks off with a bravura credit sequence that uses tableaux vivants colored like faded vintage comics to illustrate the decline of the Minutemen a gang of self-made 1940s ""superheroes"" who lost their moral compass and wound up drunk dead or institutionalized. As the movie proper begins we find ourselves in 1985 but not the one you remember In this dystopian alternate reality Richard Nixon is serving his fifth term thanks to his superhero-aided victory in Vietnam while the nation slips toward a WWIII-style nuclear confrontation with a far-from-fading USSR. Meanwhile superheroic exploits have been banned by an act of Congress and the Minutemens next-generation successors a motley gang calling themselves the Watchmen have been driven into early retirement. When one of the few surviving Minutemen the gleefully amoral Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is thrown out a high-rise window his old buddy Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) vows to investigate. In the process he visits the remaining Watchmen--still with me? Ready for a rundown? Dr. Manhattan (an almost entirely digitized creation voiced by Billy Crudup) is a once-ordinary scientist who after one of those Hulk-style lab accidents (safety first people) has mutated into a glowing blue giant who can see the future. Dr. Manhattans superhuman knowledge of time and space (hes the only Watchman with quantifiable powers) has rendered him almost entirely indifferent to human affairs ""A live body and a dead body contain the same number of particles"" he notes on learning of his comrades death. This Spock-like detachment is understandably maddening to Dr. M.s longtime girlfriend Laurie Jupiter aka the Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). While old Bluey tends to his abstruse experiments Laurie reignites a friendship with Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) once the fearsome Nite Owl II now a paunchy introvert who spends his days tinkering with his homemade hovercraft. Theres also Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) the worlds smartest man whose only superpower at first seems to be the gift of boring audiences into a state of near-catatonia but who emerges into importance late in the story. The psychological sophistication of Moores novel survives in a few story lines here especially during Dr. Manhattans periodic jaunts to Mars. (Its the only place he can be alone and think a kind of spa retreat in the sky.) And though Malin Akerman is a bit stiff as the Silk Spectre II she has some wonderful scenes in which she and Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino) her alcoholic ex-superhero mother explore the seldom-charted terrain of female Oedipal anxiety. Did Laurie really want to follow in her mothers latex-clad footsteps or was she shanghaied into superherodom by the force of Sallys personality? The sharpest dialogue is lifted straight from the book an action comic in which get this even the women have complex back stories and meaningful motivations. Zack Snyders last film the vile 300 should be locked in a cargo container and buried at a toxic dump site. Perhaps because of its brainier source material Watchmen is nowhere near as violent but the action scenes unfold with a similarly sadistic delectation. Whenever a fight begins (and theres one about every 15 minutes in this 160-minute movie) brace yourself for an abundance of narratively pointless bone-crunching finger-twisting limb-sawing and skull-hacking. These extreme sports are often filmed in Matrix-style slow motion a technique that tends to grind the story to a halt. Like the money shots in porn movies Snyders action scenes are an end in themselves--gratifying if you like that sort of thing gross if you dont. Advertisement Snyder also makes the common superhero-movie mistake of assuming that masks badass accouterments that they are (and Rorschachs cloth one with shape-shifting inkblot patterns is pretty cool) are more interesting to look at than human faces. When Jackie Earle Haley doffs his mask midway through the movie the sweaty shifty ratlike face beneath is a hundred times more frightening and fascinating than any inkblot could be. But damned if he doesnt clap the mask back on again shortly thereafter thereby muffling one of the films few gripping performances. The other one--Billy Crudups--also risks being smothered by the digital animation that renders his face near-unrecognizable and his body (with dangling azure wang on full view) completely so. But the actors delicate almost adolescent voice is always distinguishable beneath Dr. Manhattans gargantuan physiognomy. Crudup conveys the sadness of a man whose human desires and memories have been made all but inaccessible by the crushing weight of technology. Sadly Watchmen plays as if Zack Snyder performed a similar lab experiment on Alan Moores wonderfully human-size story.

Hes at one with his super-identity - and also crazy. (CLAY ENOS) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / March 6 2009 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Watchmen"" is finally upon us and that will mean everything to you or nothing. The new superhero movie - an anti-superhero movie in many ways - is based on a fearsomely smart DC comic series that ran for 12 issues in 1986 and 87 was quickly republished in book format and has nourished a large and fanatic cult ever since. For good reason As written by Alan Moore and drawn by Dave Gibbons ""Watchmen"" the comic book has the ideas the characters the layered details and the thematic heft of an epic novel. With one stroke it brought conceptual respectability to a scorned medium.Now we all know what happens when great novels get adapted into movies. Director Zack Snyder the man who gave us the digitized meathead heroics of ""300"" has shouldered the task of filming an unfilmable work after directors as stubborn as Terry Gilliam Paul Greengrass and Darren Aronofsky tried and failed. He has come up with a luridly violent 10-ton behemoth that at first works beautifully then only in pieces and then hardly at all. Its a case of a filmmaker being simpler than his material.At least Snyder sticks to the story. This ""Watchmen"" still takes place in an alternate 1985 a world that has seen two generations of costumed heroes since the 1940s and has finally tired of them outlawing their theatrics and forcing most into retirement. Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) for instance still keeps his Nite Owl outfit and flying car in a basement lair but he has gone physically and morally flabby. Dressing in costume used to make him feel sure he knew right from wrong. Now he isnt sure about anything.And hes one of the normal ones. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is a right-wing brute with a sideline in CIA dirty tricks; he once tried to rape the first Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino). Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) has become fabulously wealthy in retirement while entertaining a raging god complex. Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) a scientist turned blue and omnipotent after a lab accident may actually be God. His lover Laurie Jupiter a.k.a. Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) has had mother issues ever since Mom forced her into the tight costume.Then theres Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) a bitterly paranoid little nutcase who fancies himself an urban vigilante - Travis Bickle with a polka-dot facemask. Rorschachs the secret star of both comic book and movie because hes free of self-doubt Hes wholly at one with his super-identity. Hes also crazy. The genius of ""Watchmen"" is to wonder what sort of people might actually put on costumes to fight crime - with the exception of Dr. Manhattan no one here has superpowers - and to conclude that theyd have to be fame junkies power freaks psychos or naifs. All these characters come with lengthy back stories through which the movie hurtles at top speed. Theres a mystery plot - someone is killing the fading superheroes starting with the Comedian - and that plot gradually widens to take on socio-political and ultimately metaphysical dimensions. ""Watchmen"" the movie has to fill in an entire universe while simultaneously spinning it forward; its 163 minutes long and you feel every fat million-dollar second of it.Can audiences who havent read the comic play along? Im not so sure they can; the narrative density thats so rewarding on the page turns exhausting even oppressive after a mere half-hour of screen time.More problematic is that Snyder a sensualist of a movie director is adapting the work of a furious moralist Alan Moore. Scratch that; Snyders a sensation-alist happy to weave sound and imagery into a cinematic onslaught but much less comfortable with narrative cohesion or simple human emotion. He can show us what the end of the world looks like but has no idea how to convey the sound of two people talking. And this movie has a lot of people talking.The best moments in ""Watchmen"" then work as delirious music-videos the opening credits scored to Dylans ""The Times They Are A-Changin"" that fill in decades of rich alterna-history; or the 80s hit ""99 Luftballons"" that briefly turns the mood from somber to ecstatic as Dan and Laurie sneak off for an undercover date disguised as average people. Yet this approach also results in the movies absolute nadir a sex scene set to - groan - Leonard Cohens ""Hallelujah"" that gets jammed between earnestness and parody and ends up just monumentally vulgar.When in doubt Snyder falls back on ultra-violence and ""Watchmen"" earns its R rating in the grim abandonment with which bones are snapped and arms sliced off. Theres an unexpected puniness of spirit to this movie. In the original comic a sequence where Dan and Laurie fight off a gang of muggers is about the thrill of rediscovering ones inner superhero. On screen that scenes about doling out graphic punishment and its an audience-rouser in the most ugly and obvious way.The performances are a mixed bag. Akerman is downright bad but the role of Laurie was always half real woman and half fanboy fantasy. Crudup by contrast manages to get Dr. Manhattans sub-atomic Zen majesty even under the full-frontal blue pancake makeup and white contact lenses. Goode is miscast as Ozymandias; in a role the comic creators thought of as a jut-jawed Redford type he only suggests Seth Myers of ""Saturday Night Live"" - a petulant lightweight rather than a Master of the Universe.Wilson is good as the neurotic Nite Owl though and Haley is tremendous as Rorschach creating an entire tormented character through whispered voice alone. (When the mask comes off and we finally see his face its like the fulfillment of a bad dream.) The movies Rorschach is the only remaining vestige of Moores demon message that we dream up superheroes to break the laws - physical legal social - were too timid to break for ourselves. As Rorschach says to a prison full of convicts hellbent on killing him ""Im not locked in here with you. Youre locked in here with me.""Hardcore fans of the comic may be outraged that the film changes key particulars of the ending - farewell giant squid - but Id argue that that and other excisions (farewell ""Tales of the Black Freighter"") are for the better cinematically speaking. Overall Snyder has given us a ""Watchmen"" thats visually faithful to the original to the point of panel-by-panel fetishism and that may be enough for many members of the cult.The movies still the lesser artifact though. Where Moore and Gibbons created the rare superhero story that engages the head and the heart Snyder is incapable of working from anything except his gut. The director has done something commercially feasible and artistically depressing. He has turned a brilliant graphic novel back into a comic book.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Share Tweet In the mid-80s writer Alan Moore began to imagine a world in which the superheroes and costumed crime-fighters hed grown up reading helped shape the Cold War decades that had repeatedly brought humanity to the brink of extinction. It wasnt a better world. Behind their masks and glowing eyes the heroes Moore conceived and created with artist Dave Gibbons were hindered and occasionally crippled by the same conflicting impulses childhood traumas and redirected neuroses that drive everyone else. Moore and Gibbons graphic novel Watchmen helped redefine the types of stories superheroes could be used to tell not just by freighting them with darkness--too many subsequent creators showed how easy that could be--but by weaving their capes and gadgets into a dense deep narrative a detective story played out against the apocalypse in a world so thoroughly realized that Charles Dickens would be jealous. The same elements that make Watchmen a great book made a Watchmen film a difficult prospect. (Moore on principle removed himself and his name from the project which probably didnt help.) Its remarkable that any Watchmen movie made it to the screen after the years of false starts and litigation. And the one we got--directed by Zack Snyder most recently responsible for the ably made philosophically dubious Frank Miller adaptation 300--deserves credit for staying true to the characters plot (up to a point) and look of the original material while still generating his own kind of energy. Sometimes that energy feels misapplied and overcranked as the roar of the action drowns out the films human voices but Snyders Watchmen keeps moving so assuredly its nearly impossible not to get swept along. Keeping Moores alternate-universe 80s New York setting Watchmen opens with the murder of The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) a long-serving crime-fighter with a late-career sideline in covert ops. (The film keeps Moores dark joke that electing Nixon to multiple terms is one of his worlds problems.) A masked vigilante named Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley)--the only one who didnt hang up his disguise when the government outlawed civilian crime-fighters in the mid-70s--launches an investigation and uncovers a much larger conspiracy one seemingly tied to mounting nuclear tensions between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. as well as a bunch of Rorschachs old colleagues. These include the Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) who inherited the title from her mother (Carla Gugino); Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) a bookish wealthy master of machines; Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) whos since turned his remarkable intellect to acquiring wealth and power; and Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) a lab-accident-created glowing godlike being whose connection to humanity remains an open question. Theres sometimes too much Dr. Manhattan in Snyders Watchmen which often feels like a feat of engineering first an artistic expression second. But his source material keeps him grounded as does solid work from Crudup Wilson and especially Haley whose performance evokes pity fear sympathy and revulsion as he goes about his single-minded pursuit of justice without compromise. Others bring less. Given a central role the lightweight Akerman serves as an          Andie MacDowell-in-Four-Weddings-And-A-Funeral-level distraction and Snyder isnt always well-served by his tendency to start at 11 and try to turn up the volume particularly in a bunch of over-the-top bone-cracking action scenes. The time spent developing watchmen-fu would have been better invested in not blowing one of the books big Mars setpieces or figuring out a better alternate ending than the one dropped in the originals place. And yet in the end the films ambitious drive to create a dread-soaked alternate America and people it with flawed recognizable heroes carries it along. Snyder uses grand gestures to create a sense of world-imperiling doom rooted in another era but equally at home in this one. But he also remains willing to slow down to capture the gravity of a funeral or dwell on a moment between old partners patching up a friendship as doomsday approaches. Moores touch emphasizes how messed-up and needy comic-book people would have to be to do what they do. Missteps and all Snyders film gets that right and this as well When we look up in the sky we dont see a bird or a plane but a mirror.

Based on Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons lauded layered graphic novel - and handled with reverence by screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse and director Zack Snyder - the film follows a group of outcast caped crusaders as they search for the killer of one of their own. Seedy corrupt out of shape these arent your fathers superheroes though one of the ""masks"" Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino) is the mother of another the dominatrix-suited Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman). But well get to that.Watchmen is set in an alternate 1985 Richard Nixon is in his third term having won the Vietnam War and the Doomsday Clock monitoring nuclear tensions between the United States and the Soviets is inching ominously toward midnight. The movie like the comic is about power and history - its making and its reimagining.Much of Snyders affectionately pulpy yarn transpires in a grimy pre-Giuliani New York with porno houses dive bars and graffiti-covered alleyways. And in the high-rise apartment of one Edward Blake a.k.a. The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) a retired ""mask"" whose death - and blood-stained smiley-face button - gets the story rolling.And what a story flashing back and forth between two generations of costumed crime fighters - only one of whom has real super powers - Watchmen offers a paranoia-fueled look at heroism gone bad. It pokes a stick at the rotting corpse of a dystopian dream a culture running on violence and fear.The reclusive Moore in his afterword to the graphic novel described his initial concept for Watchmen as ""a more cynical and baroque take upon the Justice League of America and their ilk."" That skewed vision of classic superherodom remains at the heart of the movie but theres deeper messier philosophical stuff at work too.Voice-overed in hard-boiled noir mode by Jackie Earle Haley whose character Rorschach wears a shifting inkblot mask Watchmens gang of vigilantes-in-tights includes the paunchy Dan Dreiberg a.k.a. Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson); the effete billionaire Adrian Veidt a.k.a. Ozymandias (Matthew Goode); and the aforementioned Silk Spectre II whose mom was the first Silk Spectre strutting around in the company of The Comedian the first Nite Owl and other cartoonishly cloaked colleagues after World War II.The relationships between these characters are a tangle of egos and enmity but they share a common history - and a sense that history has left them behind.And then there is Dr. Manhattan a.k.a. Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) a blue guy (his mood and his skin color) who can turn himself into a giant bend matter teleport to Mars and radiate nuclear energy - i.e. hes a walking bomb. Thats how the United States won in Vietnam Dr. Manhattan stomping through the jungles irradiating the Viet Cong. And stomping around without any clothes Watchmen rated R for full frontal blue-man genitalia. (And rated R for the kind of gore Snyder delivered in his Dawn of the Dead remake and the thwacking violence of his digital sword-and-sandals megahit 300.)Watchmen looks amazing. The attention to detail is obsessive - film shots replicate comic panels right down to the scrawl on the walls and the litter on the curb. Snyder dazzles with dark crackpot juxtapositions upending the standard superhero fight scenes and throwing in some fetishistic sex to boot. (Nite Owls and Silk Spectre IIs kinky clinch on a hover-ship is hot and ironic thanks to the croaky tones of Leonard Cohens ""Hallelujah."")And then alas theres the plot - a twisting multitiered affair about murder conspiracy Cold War dread and nuclear holocaust. The last 40 minutes of Watchmen present an impossible lets-wrap-up-this-baby string of cliches (why do superheroes retreat to polar regions when they get moody?) and pointless fisticuffs. There is no happy ending - and thats cool thats the point. But there is a whole lot of explaining to do.Too much.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Starring Billy Crudup Malin Akerman Jackie Earle Haley Matthew Goode Patrick Wilson Jeffrey Dean Morgan Carla Gugino Director Zack Snyder Running time 243  Editorial Review ""Watchmen"" is a bore. Sad to say the much-anticipated adaptation of the worlds most celebrated graphic novel is long dull and sinks under the weight of its reverence for the original.The film like the 1986 graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons follows the tormented daily lives of a ragtag band of retired superheroes caught up in a plot to save the Earth and themselves from the machinations of a self-appointed savior of mankind who may not have mankinds best interests at heart.The gangs all here the psychotically righteous Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) the dangerously smart Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) and the shape-shifting blue nudist with seemingly limitless power Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup).The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) a patriotic brute whose murder sets the plot in motion goes through a plate glass window in exactly the same position as seen in the opening of the graphic novel.The movie exposes the glaring problems with the original material The dialogue stinks and is filled with cliches.The actors do what they can. Crudup offers a certain daffy detachment as Dr. Manhattan. Malin Akerman is generically sexy and Patrick Wilson is generically nerdy as the sensitive guy next in line for her affections.The opening scenes are a brilliant tour through Moores dystopian alternate version of history. This was the novels great strength an imagined world rich in detail familiar but alien at the same time. When the movie lingers there it entertains.But when it marches in lock step with the tedious plot the only watch that matters in ""Watchmen"" is the one on your wrist. Its telling you life is too short for this movie.-- Philip Kennicott (March 5 2009)Contains strong graphic violence sexuality nudity and language.

Watchmen. (R) Warner Bros./Fox (156 min.). Directed by Zack Snyder. With Billy Crudup Jackie Earle Haley Patrick Wilson. Opens Friday 1201 a.m. in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. What if you wrote a comic book about masked crime fighters that treated them as fully adult characters with all the personal flaws and sexual quirks that novelists gave their creations? Its been the aim of writers and artists for years and certainly plenty of talents -- Will Eisner Stan Lee Frank Miller -- have deepened the form trying to answer that question. But there was never anything quite like Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons ""Watchmen."" That classic comic book -- reissued as a bound graphic novel in 1987 -- pushed things to the breaking point. One hero was impotent. Another was a brutal misanthrope. A third was a sociopath and a fourth was a cold -- and often shockingly naked -- god. And some assassin was stalking them all. And then the comic pushed things past the breaking point with a meta-fictional structure that included interpolated diaries psychological reports even other comic books. Which has helped bedevil Hollywood for years How do you turn that into a movie? ""Watchmen"" the long-awaited answer gets it about half right. Its crusaders still cant hide their flaws behind masks. Patrick Wilsons Nite Owl has no confidence; Matthew Goodes Ozymandias has too much. Jackie Earle Haleys Rorschach is a hate-filled vigilante; Billy Crudups all-powerful Doctor Manhattan has begun to lose his humanity. Yet as much as it respectfully copies the comic book the film cant quite measure up. Unfortunately thats to be expected (and was at least by Moore who disavows all adaptations of his work). The problem is that as similar as they appear to be a comic is not a storyboard for a movie; its its own form and perfect in its own way. And the original ""Watchmen"" went well beyond storyboards and perhaps beyond what a movie can do. Whats left to put on-screen? Well plenty. There are great performances by Haley and Crudup (although Goode never convinces). There are also some fine set pieces like Rorschachs time in prison (and his fiery escape) or Manhattans transformation from mortal into superhuman. And yes boys Malin Akerman looks pretty good in her latex leggings as Silk Spectre. But a lot of what made ""Watchmen"" a special graphic novel is specific to graphic novels and filmmaker Zack Snyder -- much as the action fans loved ""300"" -- isnt enough of an artist to take it to a different level. Hes far too much a creature of cliche for that from his K-Tel-Hits-of-the-60s soundtrack to his overdone fists-through-walls fight scenes. The result is a big piece of eye candy -- a transgressive comic book turned into an expensive comic-book movie. Although to be fair the film doesnt deserve the blistering pans its been getting from some professional critics -- any more than the ecstatic raves its already garnered from some internet fanboys. Even grumpy reviewers should admit there are some strong moments here -- an opening-credit sequence staged like waxworks dioramas and Manhattans odd lonely sojourn on Mars. Even besotted Comic Book Guys must admit that there are still too many characters and that even rewritten the third act disappoints. So there are still pleasures here and perils for committed fans. But Moore was right. If you really want to watch the ""Watchmen"" at their best you need to pick up that groundbreaking yellow trade paperback -- and look behind the blood-splattered smiley face to see a graphic novel that was truly literally both. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations substance abuse strong language and extreme violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

(Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Thursday March 5 2009 1251 PM Ex-superheroes face an angry world in 1985. With Malin Akerman Billy Crudup. Director Zack Snyder. (243). R Violence sexuality language. At area theaters. The most pleasant surprise in the movie adaptation of ""Watchmen"" is the pop-art fusion set off by placing superheroes in a ""real"" world. The films biggest challenge - and accomplishment - was making that plausible. Unfortunately this megalong multicharacter epic never becomes airborne because it wears its seriousness like a cloak. Weighed down by self-importance and silly costumes it likely will be met with a shrug by audiences who dont know the well-respected 1986 graphic novel. Devotees will certainly think otherwise. But for those of us who dont genuflect before the title this is roughly half a good movie. Heres a tip When the ""owl ship"" shows up go get an extra-large soda. Youll need the caffeine. The movie peaks in its credit sequence in which to Bob Dylans ""The Times They Are A-Changin"" the alternate-history premise is set up In the 1930s masked criminals terrorized American cities so costumed vigilantes rose up. These heroes with flashy names (but no powers) became part of the national psyche -- not just its fantasy life -- until president-for-life Richard Nixon outlawed vigilantes in the 70s. By 1985 when the film takes place a group of ex-heroes called the Watchmen reconnect when one of their own a violent wild card called the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is killed. The strong-willed sociopath Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) tries to solve the case as Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) succumb to latex-covered lust. Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) has become a sneaky head of industry and Dr. Manhattan (a CGId Billy Crudup) is a research scientist. As the U.S. and the Soviets rush toward Armageddon one mans peace plan has a terrible cost. Dr. Manhattan is the movies main visual gambit. The only character with powers hes a size-changing blue-skinned mega-man born of an atomic accident who teleports to Mars and splits into three. Hes bald muscular and naked and as close as the movie will get to an Oscar. Unlike ""Sin City"" or Snyders own ""300"" ""Watchmens"" visuals are thankfully un-pushy; urban scenes look appealingly coffee-stained and the big FX moments dont distract. What is distracting is how cheap most of the performances are. Akerman and Goode are amazingly bad and Crudups gentle-giant whisper sounds like his voiceovers for MasterCards ""priceless"" ads. There are still pleasures Obvious yet still effecting soundtrack choices -- from Dylan to Simon amp; Garfunkel to Philip Glass -- lend heft as does the oddly affectionate Cold War nostalgia. The real saving grace though is Haley (""Little Children"" ""All the Kings Men""). When this former child actors mask is off for a prison sequence ""Watchmen"" finds the psychological intensity it was looking for.

As played by Malin Ackerman in this screen adaptation shes a body in a slick latex suit with no discernible personality. Director Zack Snyder (300) races through the story faithfully reproducing this bit of dialogue from Moore and that bit of imagery from Gibbons but never pausing to develop a vision of his own.

"Watchmen Reproduced almost too perfectly | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsWatchmen Reproduced almost too perfectlyIts not family entertainment but this adaptation of the apocalyptic 1980s comic satire will satisfy fanboys and newcomers. Read the review and watch the trailer.Jeffrey Dean Morgan as The Comedian in Watchmen.  (CLAY ENOS / WARNER BROS.)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 5 2009Note This review has been edited from a previously published version. Watchmen (out of 4)Starring Jackie Earle Haley Malin Akerman Billy Crudup Patrick Wilson Matthew Goode and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Directed by Zack Snyder. 162 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Happiness is a relative thing in Watchmen like the blood-spattered smiley face that is its most powerful symbol.The surly superheroes of the films titular collective dont particularly care about saving the planet - and why should they? Their most powerful member glowing blue quasi-deity Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) can stop most but not all of the bombs in an impending U.S.-Soviet nuclear war. Earth would only be relatively ruined. Such cynical fatalism hangs heavily over Watchmen Zack Snyders exceptional live-action adaptation of the apocalyptic 1980s comic satire by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. Most of the visual details and all of the character shadings of the source tale - first a comic book series later an award-winning graphic novel - arrive with gratifying exactness and astounding depth. Against considerable odds - Watchmen was deemed ""unfilmable"" due to its jagged shifts in time place and format - Snyder (300) has directed a movie that should satisfy fanboys while engaging adventurous newcomers. The story rarely flags despite its 162-minute running time.If theres a guiding philosophy for this motley sextet of vigilantes philosophers thrill seekers and latex fetishists its that theyre in it mainly for themselves. Check out Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) a sociopathic combo of Sam Spade and Travis Bickle who can barely even look at another human being hence his face mask of undulating blobs.Anyone who heads to Watchmen looking for traditional caped heroics should heed the films first words as government-backed assassin and rapist The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) bites the concrete ""Wrong as usual.""None of it either on page or screen can be construed as family entertainment. Watchmen is loaded with savage killings and mutilations fairly explicit sex and a giant naked blue sage who isnt afraid to display his shortcomings. Nor should you attempt to make much sense of the Watchmen plot which is loaded with pop-cult references calculated to send beanie propellers twirling. Snyder correctly realized that the world created by writer Moore and illustrator Gibbons is more fascinating than the storys almost mocking Armageddon scenario.The five men and one woman who are the Watchmen reside in an alternative Earth (and occasionally Mars) of 1985 where history has been rewritten with a crooked pen. Richard Nixon has been elected president for five terms (forget Watergate) the JFK assassination was a government hit job (just like you always suspected) the Vietnam War was won through napalm and Doc Manhattans jiggling junk and Chrysler guru Lee Iacocca took a bullet between the eyes in the name of capitalism. Oh and the U.S. and Soviet Union are on the brink of mutually assured destruction.This is no origin story although there are links to an earlier group known as the Minutemen whose members retired or ate lead. The films main thread is more akin to a eulogy. We meet the Watchmen years after theyve hung up their masks and leotards after ""costumed adventuring"" was outlawed. But old habits die hard. Rorschach still skulks the dirty streets of Manhattan breaking limbs and severing skulls with his Old Testament notion of summary justice. Doc Manhattan still tries to look at the big picture pondering God and the universe even as he sulks over the split from his girlfriend Laurie (Malin Akerman) who has other issues to stew over in her Watchmen alter-ego of Silk Spectre II shes following the same sexist path as her tippling mom the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino).Laurie is naturally drawn to Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) a timorous gadget freak with toys that delight and a tool that deflates. Not all of the Watchmen are seized with anxiety or self-loathing. The one called Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) a billionaire and ""worlds smartest man"" with a David Bowie crush happily exploits fame with a line of action figures. The decision to cast lesser-known actors was risky but justified by the results. Both for quality of acting (Haleys Rorschach is the standout) and for the mystery afforded by not tipping the plot with famous faces.Most of all the production design and art direction deserve kudos for so effectively conjuring the magnificent desolation of Watchmen where funky airships hover over a poisoned metropolis a blue giant sulks on Mars red surface and a narcissist builds himself a South Pole fortress.If theres anything to beef about  its that the reproduction is almost too perfect. At times its like watching an exact reproduction of Picassos Guernica awe-inspiring yet missing the emotional kick of the real thing. But you certainly cant beat the timing. Watchmen is about compromised heroes in a threatened world. Sound like any planet you know?

"Watchmen - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW WatchmenThe unfilmable classic graphic novel has been filmed. Zack Snyders resulting screen version is both bolstered and hampered by its devotion to the book.March 05 2009|Kenneth Turan | Film Critic Alan Moore was right. There isnt a movie in his landmark graphic novel ""Watchmen"" -- at least not a really good one. What we get instead is something acceptable but pedestrian an adaptation that is more a prisoner of its story than the master of it.The difficulty is not with a lack of fidelity to this dark tales narrative about an apparent plot to eliminate costumed superheroes from the alternative reality America theyve protected and defended. The changes to the story including updating its 1985 situations to include a subplot about the energy crisis are so nonessential that you might wonder why Moore has in addition to taking his name off the project vowed to ""spit venom all over"" the film version.Director Zack Snyders nonstop public pledges of fidelity to the story notwithstanding the core of what made ""Watchmen"" ""Watchmen"" what turned it into the only graphic novel to land on Time magazines list of the 100 best English-language novels is by its nature next to impossible to re-create on screen even with a 2-hour and 41-minute running time.For ""Watchmen"" on the page has the kind of structural denseness and complexity a heft and texture that are difficult for film to deliver. Moore and his co-creator artist Dave Gibbons added layers on top of layers to the story for instance ending each of the 12 chapters with different kinds of printed textual material including book chapters and psychiatric reports. There is even a comic-within-a-comic ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" now scheduled to become a separate animated piece with its own DVD release.All these elements and more inform expand on and comment about the core story in an almost Talmudic way. As Gibbons himself has said the graphic novel ""became much more about the telling than the tale itself. The plot itself is of no great consequence . . . it just really isnt the most thrilling thing about Watchmen. ""To be fair on the other hand ""Watchmens"" plot is in no way chopped liver and reverentially sticking to the source material as the first ""Harry Potter"" films did is the only thing that gives this film what watchability it has. Even if you havent read the book even if your first exposure to the story is in this denatured form you can at least sense the power of the original and thats what will stay in your mind not whats on the screen.The story as scripted by David Hayter and Alex Tse begins as all good mysteries do with a murder. A man named Edward Blake otherwise known as the superhero the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is brutally killed in October 1985 and lots of people want to know why. This murder takes place in an alternative universe very much like our own but with key differences. Richard Nixon is an American president in both but in the ""Watchmen"" world hes been elected to five terms. This universe has a tradition of masked crime fighters. A group of them banded together in the 1940s as the Minutemen and another group was formed decades later.Since the 1977 passage of the Keene Act this new generation of so-called vigilantes has been forced to retire and thats what Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) and Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) have done. Still active each in his own way are the most compelling of the group Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) and Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley).Dr. Manhattan once physicist Jon Osterman is the only being in the ""Watchmen"" world with true superpowers courtesy of your standard scientific experiment gone horribly wrong. Often seen pale blue and naked (dont ask) the good doctor is a master of space and time capable of bending matter to his will. He works for the government now serving among other things as a one-man shield against the ever-increasing possibility of Russian nuclear attack.At the other end of the spectrum is the hunted Rorschach the sociopathic terror of the group given to writing things in his journal like ""the night reeks of fornication and bad consciences."" With his face a mask of shifting inkblots he is the first to suspect that ""somebodys gunning for masks"" and the first to investigate what that might mean.Given that this is just the hint of an outline of ""Watchmens"" complexities its not clear what any director could have done with the material though many big names including Terry Gilliam and Paul Greengrass were given a shot. Though Snyder does not exactly embarrass the material his selection has not had inspiring results.For one thing Snyder has been unable to create a satisfying tone for the proceedings. While the graphic novel played everything as realistically as it could the film feels artificially stylized and inappropriately cartoonish. That in turn undercuts the films key point that these superheroes have very human flaws and limitations.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESStudios in talks to end Watchmen suitJanuary 10 2009Fox Warner Bros. to let judge settle Watchmen...January 7 2009Watchmen judge undecidedDecember 16 2008Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/05/entertainment/et-watchmen5,200,watchmen25,watchmen,latimes

For years opinionated fandom asked whether Watchmen -- Alan Moores and Dave Gibbons game-changing 1980s deconstruction of the spandexed-superhero comic-book genre -- could be rendered faithfully as a movie. Its too nonlinear some argued. Too violent. Too sexy. Too long. Too mature. Too cynical. Too complicated. Too dark. In truth its all of those things. But the tale of outcast vigilantes in a rotting alternate America was never ""unfilmable."" The question isnt whether Watchmen could be turned into a movie. The question is should it? And judging from Zack Snyders garish uneven and excessively cruel interpretation Id say no. It shouldnt. It should have remained what it was from the start a masterpiece of vicious Cold War paranoia completely and gut-churningly rendered on the printed page. The film is not all bad. Written by David Hayter and Alex Tse it remains largely faithful to the structure and aesthetic of the book -- beginning with the murder of Eddie Blake (a nasty dishy Jeffrey Dean Morgan) aka the Comedian a hater of women and lover of irony who wears the series iconic yellow smiley pin. In the plot that follows a few elements are altered or ditched (what no huge squid?) but plenty others are panel-for-panel re-creations of the comic. The dystopian setting remains intact with a still-in-charge Richard Nixon overseeing a country on the brink of nuclear war with the Soviets. The Watchmen a bent band of masked crime-fighters were outlawed by Congress 10 years earlier. But when the Comedian gets whacked his old comrade Rorschach investigates -- hes the one in the morphing ink-blot mask a guise assumed by Jackie Earle Haley with wiry tension and a Batman croak. The one in the dorky raptor headpiece is Nite Owl aka Daniel Dreiberg a decent fella with virility issues. Dan (a nicely defeated Patrick Wilson) pines for Silk Spectre aka Laurie Jupiter (a half-hearted Malin Akerman) but shes been dating Dr. Manhattan aka Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) a hulking cerulean nude who might be a member of the Blue Man Group if a nuclear meltdown dissolved their clothing. Jon can bilocate bifurcate blow up to towering proportions win the Vietnam War see into his future and zap himself or anyone anywhere even Mars. He likes it there because its pretty and empty and red. Hes not so fond of people any longer -- and anyway turns out he might be a carcinogen. Bummer. But nobodys perfect. And if you ask me Dr. Manhattan is hands-down the coolest thing going. He brings to Watchmen a philosophizing grandeur that the rest of the movie lacks even as Crudup whispers his lines like early Marilyn Monroe. At least his breathiness is less annoying than Matthew Goodes whose super-smarty-pants Ozymandias suffers from pinched locution and a bad dye job. Even worse stand-ins for Nixon Lee Iacocca Pat Buchanan and other period celebs -- all dolled up with lumpy faux schnozzes and unfortunate wigs -- add a cheap cartoonish goofiness that feels incongruous in the world of the Watchmen. But the biggest problem top to bottom is overkill. It is too long; it is too violent. I didnt think it possible but Snyders taste for hyberbolic splicch and splat (which looked more artful and less revolting in 300) goes beyond the already-shocking bloodshed of the original work. In the book dogs gnaw on a leg bone. In the movie its a little girls dismembered foot. In the book Rorschach sets her killer on fire. In the movie he chunks him with a meat cleaver -- six times straight to the head. A few scenes later an inmate gets both arms buzzed off by a saw. Its worth noting Alan Moore pulled his name from the credits just as he pulled it from 2005s far-better V for Vendetta. Good move -- but not because Watchmens ""unfilmable."" Because it is at times unwatchable. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Lighting amp; Ceiling Fans at Home Depot Up to 80% off + free...

By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The image of the doomsday clock is an apt metaphor for the film adaptation of Watchmen (  out of four). Over the course of two decades several celebrated directors were involved with some version of the movie from Terry Gilliam to Darren Aronofsky to Paul Greengrass. As the film bounced from one studio to another a host of actors including Tom Cruise and Jude Law expressed interest in roles. Some including Hilary Swank and Joaquin Phoenix signed on early but left with the change of directors. Lucky for them. The highly anticipated Watchmen as directed by Zack Snyder (300) seems poised to self-destruct. It starts out powerfully with a brutal but inventively offbeat action sequence to the tune of Nat King Coles Unforgettable. As the story proceeds however it grows plodding convoluted and forgettable. Based on Alan Moores cult graphic novel Watchmen is an action-adventure mystery set in the mid-1980s in a mythical USA where a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union looms large. Government-controlled costumed vigilantes are an accepted segment of society but independent crime fighters are no longer allowed to work their magic. When a retired masked crusader known as The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) is viciously murdered his former colleague Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) uncovers a plan to eliminate costumed heroes. As he pieces together the conspiracy Rorschach reunites with his fellow vigilantes known as the Watchmen in an effort to dismantle the plot. Only one member Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) actually has superpowers acquired after a science experiment went horribly wrong. He struts around buck naked bathed in a startling shade of indigo from head to toe resembling a radioactive and NC-17-rated member of the Blue Man Group. There are plenty of additional distractions including Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) whose black-and-flesh-colored latex outfit and thigh-high boots connote dominatrix more than good-natured comic-book heroine. (Carla Gugino plays her mother Silk Spectre.) Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) is a techno-geek who eventually teams up with Silk who had been Dr. Manhattans girl. A sex scene meant to be steamy comically recalls a Showgirls moment that is best forgotten. Moore has famously disavowed the screen adaptation. Little wonder. For all its special-effects feats Watchmen is a pretentious and overheated mess. Not many stories require 21/2 hours to be told effectively and this is not one of the rare few. Throughout its protracted length an intrusive narration grates more than it elucidates. Most disturbing is the almost sadistic quality to some of the films violence especially in scenes involving the killing of a little girl. V for Vendetta based on another Moore graphic novel was more intellectually stimulating and morally complex. What Watchmen does have going for it is its cinematography. If only the story were as dazzling. In the canon of comic-book movies its not as campy bad as the Batman starring George Clooney but nowhere near the caliber of the Spider-Man movies or The Dark Knight. It may have more style but its only a jot more entertaining than Catwoman. Rated R for strong graphic violence sexuality nudity and language. Running time 2 hours 43 minutes.

For decades the watchdog organization insured that daring superheroes remained semi-squeaky-clean despite occasional story lines involving social taboos (drugs campus unrest). Frank Millers skewed 1986 reimagining of Batman The Dark Knight Returns took a bold stab at examining moral relativism among costumed vigilantes but his dystopic debunking was just the first step toward cracking the Code. The real Rosetta stone of superhero revisionism would hit shelves the next year. This backstory is key to understanding why Alan Moore and Dave Gibbonss Watchmen is so groundbreaking. A dead-serious funny book that permanently turned superhero mythology on its masked head this 12-issue series deconstructed comics good-versus-evil ideology with rigorous psychological realism Meet the postmodern caped crusader one whos sociopathic sexually dysfunctional a fascistic government stooge or some combo of all three. Since its publication in 1986 and 87 Watchmen has become exhibit A for whiz-pow comics as significant literature (its included in Times list of 100 greatest novels). Meanwhile film audiences have grown accustomed to seeing pathologically screwed-up berprotagonists strut and fret across screens. If there was ever a time to make a ""proper"" Watchmen film its now though Jeffrey Dean Morgan) once known as the Comedian tussles with a badass stranger; the rumble ends with the seriess iconically creepy image of a smiley face splattered with blood and the former hero being tossed out of his penthouse window. What follows is the movies single greatest accomplishment a credits sequence audaciously set to Bob Dylans ""The Times They Are a-Changin?"" that interweaves the films alternate universe into a familiar 20th-century landscape. Alfred Eisenstaedts legendary Times Square--smooch photo President Kennedys assassination Vietnam and Kent State get thrown into historys mixtape with our masked avengers. Thanks to them Richard Nixon has become a domestic dictator. These costumed freaks protect a curdled American way even if that means ixnaying truth or justice in the process. Its a virtuoso introduction to Watchmens what-if 1985 world on the brink of nuclear armageddon and along with Snyders regrettable fetish for slo-mo action sequences (did 300 not get that out of his system?) one of the few times the self-proclaimed ""visionary"" () director gets creative with the material. Fearful of any reaction from a fan base more rabidly protective than a mama lion Snyder treats the comic as both script and storyboard. The books more cinematic flourishes such as the pullback from that bloody button to the top of a 20-story building are re-created with such fidelity that the effect is like being stuck in an echo chamber. As the movie unwinds the various narrative strands--a psycho called Rorschach (Haley) tries to figure out whos killing ""masks"" the all-powerful blue-skinned being Dr. Manhattan (Crudup) gets stuck in an existential funk retired heroes Nite Owl (Wilson) and Silk Spectre (Akerman) go once more unto the breach--Moores dialogue is frequently spoken verbatim with mixed results Haleys gravelly mumbling is a good fit for the seriously damaged vigilante but given Akermans cringeworthy readings one can assume she was hired because of her uncanny resemblance to a Jack Kirby drawing. Such asphyxiating scrupulousness should keep the Watch-geeks happy even if they--along with the rest of us--will balk at the odd tonal switches. But what the film rightfully retains and often nails is the books commitment to seriously digging deep into the psychic debris of these archetypes; not even last years The Dark Knight ventured this far into the abyss which helps make the films myriad flaws far more forgivable. Moore and Gibbons brilliantly used the idiom and vocabulary of Silver Age superheroics to critique the medium itself dragging those perpetually adolescent men-in-tights stories into an artistic adulthood. No matter how lofty its intelli-blockbuster ambitions Snyders admirable take doesnt quite do the same for superhero movies. It does however move the genres metaphorical clock hands several clicks closer to maturity.--David Fear Find showtimes More new Film reviews Posted Thursday March 5 2009 Details Release details Cast and crew Users say Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/watchmen,200,watchmen29,watchmen,timeout

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> As for you Watchmen junkies enough with tearing down the movie before you even see it. Moore soured by the Hollywood mangling of From Hell The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and V for Vendetta has removed his good name from the credits. In the process he has inadvertently inspired a band of rabid loyalists ready to shoot Snyder on sight. Sheesh. Whether the movie soars or tanks it wont make the comic book extinct. Get a grip. Caught between the rock of fanboy adulation and the hard place of newbie indifference the R-rated nearly-three-hour movie version of Watchmen is a cinematic pinata getting whacked from every side. One look at mutant physicist Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) standing 200 feet glowing with blue light and flashing a few yards of giant blue wiener and youll think youre in for the colossus of campfests. Or glom onto Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) the vigilante in a white mask who shows a face of ever-changing ink blots and youll think a popcorn night at the movies has morphed into a Rorschach test administered by a lethally sadistic shrink. Whats the truth? A little of both Im afraid. Moore recalled his four years of toil on the 12-issue DC Comics series as ""slam-dancing with a bunch of rhinos."" That description also fits watching the movie which stumbles and sometimes falls on its top-heavy ambitions. But there are also flashes of visual brilliance and performances especially from Haley and Crudup that drill deep into the novels haunted soul. Snyder a director of TV ads (yikes) who made his feature debut with a rockin 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead took an ass-kicking from comic purists for getting too computer-flashy with his 2007 smash 300 from Frank Millers graphic novel about the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae. Snyder goes easier on the computer this time and strains to stay faithful to whats on the page. He and screenwriters David Hayter and Alex Tse admirably resist updating to the here-and-now War on Terror. As the story moves from New York to Mars the time is still 1985 Cold War tensions simmer and Nixon -- in his fifth term as president -- hovers over a Doomsday Clock that ticks ever closer to atomic midnight. Snyder sums it up in a yowsa opening that merges Vietnam moonwalks you name it into a visionary time capsule. Plot point coming Since 1977 masked heroes have been banned from doing their thing. Except for Dr. Manhattan rendered Ubermensch in a lab accident they have no superpowers just a jones to fight in drag. The feds have drafted Dr. Manhattan to take on the Soviets but the rest of the Watchmen have been outlawed. Think The Incredibles without Pixar or pity. Second plot point coming The Comedian a.k.a. Edward Blake played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan has been tossed from a window of his high-rise. ""Somebody knows why"" writes Rorschach a.k.a. Walter Kovacs in his journal. He thinks its the start of a conspiracy to kill the ""Masks"" as the crime fighters were called. So he starts rooting out the second generation to fight back. He begins with Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) a.k.a. Dan Dreiberg whos gone to pudge since putting away his Batman-like costume. Wilson (Angels in America) gained a few pounds but otherwise suggests nothing less than an Adonis in a role that cried out for say Philip Seymour Hoffman. Nonetheless humdrum Dan is roused to action. Hes all limp-dick with Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) a.k.a. Laurie Jupiter until cracking heads makes him rock-hard. Laurie had been getting it on with Dr. Manhattan a.k.a. Jon Osterman but his interests had turned to physics and Mars despite his giant blue penis. Whats a girl to do especially one with a mom (Carla Gugino perfecto) the original Silk Spectre who may have been raped by the Comedian? For Laurie its out with the Doc and in with the hottie spandex (hello Killer Barbie) just the thingie to put new hoot into Nite Owl II. The junior versions of Nite Owl and Silk Spectre are the weakest and silliest part of the movie. Akerman trying to channel Cameron Diaz lacks the juice to do justice even to Charlies Angels. The fights with this un-dynamic duo sporting powers theyre not supposed to have are shockingly subpar. These doodles are helpless against Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) a.k.a. Adrian Veidt a mad genius who made a killing selling masked action figures to the gullible public. No wonder the film loses its power and point. Luckily Crudup (Almost Famous) has the acting chops to take us inside the moral battles raging in Dr. Manhattans blue skull. And Haley a revelation in Little Children penetrates the heart of Watchmens darkness. His origin story involving child abuse and butchery dovetails into a revenge drama that pulsates with the emotional intensity and artery-spurting violence that indelibly marked the graphic novel. At its best Snyders movie gets at the symbolism of that smile button splashed with blood on the first Watchmen cover. Viewers who worry about the Giant Squid the Black Freighter and other Watchmen elements missing from the movie are missing the point. Even in the time of a popular new leader Watchmen tells us to be on guard about our alleged protectors. Moore worried about winding up with ""a big messy steaming bowl of semiotic spaghetti."" OK Snyder should have worried more. But there are worse things than a movie that bites off more than it can chew. Look at the drool coagulating at the multiplex. And if you have to go back to the comic to learn that the freaks in Watchmen are not only for geeks maybe thats not so bad. Just sayin.

"Watchmen | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; watchmen ) Watchmen (United States 2009) March 04 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Transforming Watchmen one of the most lauded comic series of all time into a movie is as ambitious an undertaking as anyone in Hollywood is likely to attempt. For more than 20 years a variety of people (including Terry Gilliam Darren Aronofsky and Paul Greengrass) have been involved and all have backed off when faced with the enormity of the task. The team to finally get it done is headed by 300 director Zack Snyder. Whether Watchmen will become known as ""Snyders Folly"" remains to be seen. Snyder may have replicated the narrative faithfully (with the exception of a change to a climactic plot device) and re-created the dark look of the comic books but the nuances are gone. The film is too busy too narratively dense and too awkwardly structured for it to achieve the level of absorption that one can get from reading the books. Books with or without pictures are a different medium than movies and a slavish adherence to the storyline does not guarantee success. Watchmen is a perfect example of how material no matter how reverentially treated and massaged often loses something critical in translation. Most of the cuts made by Snyder and his creative team are small but they add up. The rich backstory is eviscerated with pieces of it making it to the screen - enough to inform the uninitiated but not to eliminate all confusion. Perhaps the biggest flaw however is the inability to navigate this story at ones own pace. A movie by its nature moves forward relentlessly allowing little time for introspection review or consideration. These elements are necessary for Watchmen. They give it power and depth. By not being able to study a panel turn back a page and re-explore something or pause to consider the moral implications of whats being stated too much has been lost. The film feels like a shiny toy not a seminal milestone in graphic literature. Arguably Watchmen the movie makes a good companion piece to Watchmen the comic series although writer Alan Moore who has vigorously denounced the project (sight unseen) would not agree. Yet the movie appears to have been made primarily with the Watchmen fan in mind. Those who approach the movie with an understanding of the plot and a familiarity with the characters and their backstories will get more out of the movie than those who are facing their first exposure to the material. For anyone coming to Watchmen as a different way to experience something with which they have a link the film may work in the way Snyder intended. However for viewers without this background Watchmen has the ability to alternately fascinate and frustrate. Its a project that reaches for a greatness that ultimately eludes its grasp. Some have speculated that perhaps the newfound international passion for dark superheroes as evidenced by the box office success of The Dark Knight will help Watchmen. But this is different. In Moores vision Watchmen deconstructs the myths rather than adding to them and some of that makes it into the movie. Although there are superheroes they are not of the conventional sort and the story does not follow any of the traditional formulas. Although there is action it is limited and confined to short violent bursts. Most of Watchmen is setup and exposition. In fact the first 2/3 of the film are heavily weighted with character-building flashbacks. This is a structural flaw. It replicates material from the comics but keeps the viewer wondering if the narrative is ever going to attain momentum. The reason the movie has such a long running time (163 minutes) is because theres a lot of baggage that needs to be unloaded before the main storyline can begin to unfold. Watchmen takes place in an alternate universe during October 1985. Richard Nixon unencumbered by the Watergate scandal and appreciated by a cynical population is in his fifth term as president. The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. have never been more antagonistic toward each other and the threat level is sliding in the direction of DefCon 1. The ""nuclear clock"" is at five minutes to midnight and ticking inexorably toward Armageddon. This is the reality in which the main characters find themselves. With two exceptions they are ex-superheroes - individuals who have been forced by legislative mandate to remove their costumes and bury their secret identities. This law does not apply to Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) the blue-skinned superman who is the United States ultimate weapon and most compelling nuclear deterrent. Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) has chosen to live outside of the law acting the part of the vigilante with sadistic resolve. He still wears his mask and prowls the nighttime shadows. Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) once called Silk Spectre is Dr. Manhattans girlfriend and works as his assistant. Adrien Veidt (Matthew Goode) formerly Ozymandias a billionaire businessman and the ""smartest man in the world"" is working with Dr. Manhattan on a plan to save humanity. And Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) a.k.a. Night Owl is at loose ends trying to figure out how he fits in the new order. There are other older ""Watchmen"" as well - those who were active in the 40s when the group was first formed. These include Lauries mother Sally Jupiter (Carla Gugino) and the crass classless Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) whose death during the films opening scene sets events in motion. With the planet on the edge of nuclear annihilation are superheroes relevant? Is anything relevant? Certainly the story told by Watchmen is heavily allegorical since its about humanitys capacity to destroy itself. The storys eventual moral conundrum comes down to a variation on an old theme Do the ends justify the means? There are of course no easy answers or in fact answers at all. Watchmen also calls into questions the motives that drive some of these superheroes. Are they doing this for the good of men or to satisfy some inner need for violence and mayhem. Are they heroes or vigilantes? From a visual and stylistic standpoint Watchmen develops a gloomy paranoid atmosphere but doesnt overplay it. There are also fewer flourishes than one might expect from the man behind 300. Compared to that film this one appears almost conventional. Care was taken to ensure that the look of the movie is in synch with that of the comic books and there are times when panels from the source function as storyboards. Despite having detailed backgrounds that unfold in flashbacks the protagonists of Watchmen fail to compel. The exception is Rorschach who is brilliantly portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley (the pedophile in Little Children). Everyone else is bland. Its difficult to care about them especially the enigmatic Dr. Manhattan. This is one of the reasons it can be difficult for the non-aficionado to become involved in the story. The world is so bleak and the characters so colorless that there seems to be little reason to care whether or not the planet survives. Watching Watchmen is at times more of an intellectual exercise than a visceral one. Snyders decision to film it verbatim inadvertently keeps the audience at arms-length. Those who come to the film with a prior love of the characters may rediscover that here. Those who are new to these disillusioned superheroes may wonder if theres a reason to bother caring. Aside from Haley who brings energy to his interpretation of the disturbed Rorschach none of the principals are memorable. Matthew Goode and Patrick Wilson occupy space and say lines but theres not much for the viewer to hook into. Malin Akerman is attractive and looks nice with and without clothing but theres no humanity in her performance. Billy Crudup (with a huge CGI assist) gives us the Dr. Manhattan Snyder apparently wants a detached emotionless enigma. In the comic book Dr. Manhattan is a tragic tortured figure but not much of that comes across in the way Crudup portrays him. (For anyone who is wondering Dr. Manhattan is naked in most of his scenes and there are plenty of opportunities to glimpse the dangling blue torpedo - Snyder perhaps unduly influenced by Judd Apatow seems to enjoy showing it.) Jeffrey Dean Morgans interpretation of The Comedian is lively but his screen time is limited and the character feels unfinished. In the comic books Richard Nixon is a shadowy figure. For some reason Snyder elects to give him a fair amount of screen time and to place him in good light. The problem isnt this decision but that the actor who plays Nixon Robert Wisden is miscast. The physical resemblance is weak and the layers of makeup applied in an ineffective attempt to make Wisden better resemble the president look cheap and unconvincing. The prosthetic nose is so over-the-top that it causes him to resemble Jimmy Durante more than Nixon. The end result is borderline laughable. (It also doesnt help that Frank Langellas recent interpretation from Frost/Nixon lingers in the mind.) Yes this is a minor misstep but its a jarring one and the makeup is just as bad with the other ""old"" characters. Watchmen isnt brain-dead and thats a good thing. In fact the opposite is true. But the film as pregnant with ideas as it may be has trouble standing on its own and for a movie thats opening in thousands of theaters thats a problem. For the Watchmen fan this may be as close to the Holy Grail as a motion picture could come. For everyone else a sense of frustration and disappointment is not unwarranted. Watchmen is many things but it is not the Next Great Comic Book Movie or the film that will advance graphic novel adaptations to the next level.

"Watchmen stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan Billy Crudup Carla Gugino - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Watchmen stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan Billy Crudup Carla GuginoRating 11/2 stars (fair)March 06 2009|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICWatchmen  1/2Talk all you want about the dense novelistic embroidery of the graphic novel ""Watchmen"" its obsessive detail and clever subversion of superhero mythology and masked avenger cliches. But really the appeal of the film version such as it is relates almost entirely to eye-for-an-eye severed-limb-for-a-limb vengeance 2 hours and 41 minutes of it with just enough solemnity to make anyone who thought ""The Dark Knight"" was a little gassy think twice about which superhero myth theyre calling gassy.FOR THE RECORD - This story contains corrected material published March 7 2009.Example child molestation. ""Watchmen"" like ""Sin City"" before it relishes the specter of child molestation as a dramatic device because once youve established a subhuman predator you can have someone like Rorschach in ""Watchmen"" ram an ax blade into a mans cranium in close-up several times over and over and its OK because hes vermin and weve already seen two junkyard dogs fighting over the girls severed leg. The audience drools for justice and while Rorschach is meant to be a psychopath hes our psychopath one of a group of forcibly retired masked crime-fighters uneasily reunited to save the world and to save themselves from the person targeting them for extinction.I was late to the 1986 graphic novel by Alan Moore (who has disowned the film) (this sentence as published has been corrected in this text). On the page it really is something an unruly meticulously cruddy depiction of a world teetering on the edge of apocalypse plus side trips to Mars. Youve heard of the Fantastic Four. Here are the Psychosexually Messed-Up and Pathologically Brutal Six.Zack Snyders bloated screen adaptation will go over best with fanboys fangirls fanmen and fanwomen who give high marks for slavish fidelity to the source material. A few things didnt make the cut and the endings been futzed with but the screen ""Watchmen"" apes the pictorial style and many of the individual panels of illustrator Dave Gibbons work. The only part of the movie that feels like an addition rather than a recycling is the prologue (scored all too predictably to Dylans ""The Times They Are A-Changin"") establishing this alternate-20th-Century universe populated by a select group of masked avengers riding high one decade shut away the next and by Nixon yet.In this universe America wins the war in Vietnam with the help of Dr. Manhattan the most outre superpowered and Spocklike of the Watchmen. Hes played by Billy Crudup barely there underneath all the motion-capture digitized effects. He glows can bend space and time and glides through the picture like a nude one-man edition of Blue Man Group.The film takes its sweet time setting up everyones massive chunks of back story. The mystery at the heart of ""Watchmen"" has to do with whos killing off the old gang beginning with the most unsavory of the lot The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan). Well its a tie actually Rorschach played by Jackie Earle Haley is the most unsavory and most efficiently murderous. The comparatively clean-cut Watchmen are Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) and his squeeze Silk Spectre II played by Malin Akerman possibly the worst actress in Hollywood at the moment. ""Oh my God Im on Mars"" she valley-girls at one interplanetary juncture.Haley practically alone among his cohorts conveys a vivid sense of engagement. Too many of his fellow performers barely register. An exception is Carla Gugino who plays Akermans mother a retired masked avenger herself. Shes such a good actress in addition to fulfilling the specific demands of her outfits and yet its depressing to see her redeem what she can in ""Watchmen"" amid the self-righteous sleaze.The brutality is pretty numbing in ""Watchmen"" and while the graphic novel poured it on as well Snyders a lunkhead and a lingerer when it comes to using that violence for storytelling purposes. Were supposed to be wrestling with moral conundrums throughout ""Watchmen"" as the weakest and most sociopathic of the protectors incinerate and destroy for the good of humankind. But the films dour viciousness is a lot less inventive than the graphic novels. The tone is set at the beginning (as it was on the page) by Rorschachs journal in which he cranks off on ""all those liberals and intellectuals and smooth talkers"" that have wrecked the nation. You wonder if Rush Limbaugh is starring in a remake of ""Taxi Driver."" And you wonder if Snyder whose earlier graphic novel adaptation ""300"" was more engaging than this fetid item will ever learn to imagine his own brand of cinematic miseries rather than plunking someone elses on the screen.- - -MPAA rating R (for strong graphic violence sexuality nudity and language)Running time 2 41.

But Irans America-hating leader said he would not give in by ""one iota"" - and threatened to bar some U.N. arms inspections. The dispute is escalating towards a showdown following the announcement by European leaders on Thursday that two years of bitter negotiations with Iran had reached a dead end. The seriousness of the situation was underlined when British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw took pains yesterday to stress that the United States and Britain havent discussed military action against Iran - but would encourage economic sanctions. Bush indicated he agreed on the need for U.N.-imposed sanctions if a new round of diplomacy fails and used exceptionally tough words to warn that Iran could not be allowed to go ahead with its nuclear arms program. ""The reason its unacceptable is because Iran armed with a nuclear weapon poses a grave threat to the security of the world"" he said after his first White House meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He urged a diplomatic effort with the goal that ""the Iranians not have a nuclear weapon in which to blackmail and/or threaten the world."" ""I want to remind you that the current president of Iran has announced that the destruction of Israel is an important part of their agenda. And thats unacceptable."" He was referring to the fanatical Mahmoud Ahmadinejad who earlier yesterday dismissed talk of U.N. sanctions. ""Iranian people do not allow foreigners to block their progress"" state-run radio quoted him as saying. U.S. European Chinese and Russian officials are due to hold talks Monday in London to see if they can find a common way of confronting the mullah-run government of Iran. The White House declined to predict whether Russia or China would veto a bid to bring the issue to the Security Council which could result in sanctions. But Iran said if the United Nations acts it would refuse to cooperate with the U.N.s nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency as it has for three years. That would mean the end of random inspections said Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki.

Watchmen Director Zack Snyder. Cast Malin Ackerman Patrick Wilson Jackie Earle Haley. Rating Rated R for strong graphic violence sexuality nudity and language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Nothing lovable about Jeffrey Dean Morgan in Watchmen Akerman jumps into the action Watchmen sequel unlikely Jackie Earle Haleys comeback is complete Its Watchmen time Superheroes we love Movies based on comic books ""Watchmen"" actually achieved it. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons comic which appeared originally in 1986 and 1987 was a visionary deconstruction of the superhero genre offering a look at what people who fight crime behind masks might really be like while also confronting Cold War fears. Now director Zack Snyder (""300"") tackles a movie version of what was long thought to be impossible to film. Its not - the film is in fact almost slavish in its re-creation of the comic. Yet while it is visually stunning the movie ultimately leaves you as cold and detached as Dr. Manhattan. If you havent read the comic of course that reference makes no sense - and thats part of the problem. Like the comic ""Watchmen"" begins with the murder of the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan); his apartment is broken into and after a savage fight hes thrown through a window falling to his death. This leads into an inspired title sequence that explains the origins of masked heroes. A group calling itself the Minutemen in the 1940s evolved into the Watchmen until masked crime fighters were outlawed. Now in an alternate version of 1985 the ""masks"" as theyre called are mostly dead crazy or living under different identities. Dan Drieberg (Patrick Wilson) who fought as Nite Owl II clearly longs for the old days; his dissatisfaction with his life has left him impotent literally and figuratively. Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) known back in the day as Ozymandias has cashed in on his former life and as the worlds smartest man runs a business empire. Only the psychopathic Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) refuses to turn in his mask (which features ever-changing ink blots) roaming the streets and meting out his violent brand of retribution. Then there is Jon Osterman (Billy Crudup) now known as Dr. Manhattan. A lab accident left him naked blue and nearly omnipotent; hes able to bend matter to his will. Richard Nixon used him as the ultimate weapon to win the war in Vietnam and get himself elected to a third term; now Dr. Manhattan lives with Laurie Jupiter (Malin Ackerman) herself a former mask known as Silk Spectre who chose the life to make her mother the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino) happy. Rorschach is convinced someone is out to kill the former masks; while the rest of the group is reluctant to believe him at first the evidence begins to mount. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre are soon back in action in more ways than one - Dr. Manhattan is growing increasingly detached from humanity his own and everyone elses so Laurie leaves him. After a disastrous appearance on a TV talk show Dr. Manhattan heads for Mars determined to sit out the impending nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Its a lot to keep up with and without the mental blueprint of the comic to help you out its nearly impenetrable. That may not matter - the source material is so revered and so reverently portrayed that fans of the comic will look for reasons to overlook the plot holes. For everyone else perhaps the mere size and audacity of the thing will be enough to overwhelm its shortcomings. Or perhaps not. Once the thrill of seeing the comic come to life fades the film feels oddly flat. Moores writing and Gibbons art used nihilism and cynicism as weapons more powerful than even Dr. Manhattan. The masks for varying reasons could no longer connect with the world around them but we could connect with them. Thats not really the case in the film. While the acting is good as a rule (particularly Haley whose Rorschach is even more brutal when the mask comes off) the characters are remote held at a distance. ""Watchmen"" isnt a disaster. It is actually pretty much what some would have it be - a (mostly) faithful re-creation of the comic. But it could have been so much more.

Hoberman Zack Snyder Didnt Ruin Watchmen Wednesday March 4 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 2 Two Love Nite Owl and Silk Spectres explosive relationship.Warner Bros. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The most eagerly anticipated (as well as the most beleaguered) movie of the year (if not the century) Watchmen is neither desecratory disaster nor total triumph. In filming David Hayter and Alex Tses adaptation of the most ambitious superhero comic book ever written director Zack Snyder has managed to address the cult while pandering to the masses.Warner Bros. which battled Fox for possession of the property--from which author Alan Moore has typically removed his name-is marketing Snyder who remade George Romeros Dawn of the Dead in 2004 and had a surprise mega-hit two years later with his adaptation of Frank Millers comic book Thermopylae 300 as a ""visionary."" Thats a grateful studios code word for ""competent hack."" The master of the vid-game aesthetic has successfully streamlined Moores 12-part graphic novel and even at a running time that tops two hours and 40 minutes made it commercially viable.In its movie incarnation Watchmen (which first appeared early in Ronald Reagans second term) could be most simply described as an apocalyptic sci-fi murder mystery cum love story set in an alternate universe where masked superheroes are real albeit largely retired thanks to Richard Nixon who is enjoying his fifth term as president--in part because the greatest of the Watchmen Dr. Manhattan a mutated atomic scientist who glows like blue kryptonite and possesses unlimited cosmic powers settled the Vietnam War in a week. The story unfolds amid many noir tropes (endless night constant rain) and numerous flashbacks in the shadow of impending nuclear obliteration.As the U.S. and Soviet Union face off over Afghanistan the irascible renegade ""mask"" Rorschach (played in an inspired bit of casting by Jackie Earle Haley) discovers that an even more asinine colleague formerly known as the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has been murdered. The Comedian is a cigar chomping a-hole responsible for doing away with the alternate universes Woodward and Bernstein as well as numerous Vietnamese and hippie protesters who at his height claimed to embody the American Dream--so his death has a particular resonance. Rorschach a paranoid type who keeps a Travis Bickle-oid journal jumps to the conclusion that someone is plotting to kill all surviving Watchmen although he fails to persuade either Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) the most successful of the ""masks"" or his depressed onetime partner Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) to come out of retirement and join him on the case.Meanwhile Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) to whom the president (Robert Wisden brandishing an alarming ski-nose) has given the responsibility of deterring Russias nuclear threat is increasingly alienated. Having offended his inamorata the erstwhile Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) by projecting a pair of avatars for her sexual gratification while he solves a difficult equation in the lab the azure godling violently teleports himself from his boudoir to a guest TV appearance with Ted Koppel (Ron Fassler) and then angry at being accused of spreading cancer sulkily bungs off to Mars. After Rorschach is set up busted and sent to the pen the two second-generation masks Nite Owl and Silk Spectre return to action both in public (rescuing fire victims from the roof of a flaming apartment tower) and in private (humping like porn stars amid the piles of their passionately discarded superhero paraphernalia in Nite Owls flying whatchamacallit).It should be apparent that Watchmen is founded on a pop mythology nearly as detailed as Lord of the Rings. Moreover in its parodic historical references integration of various written texts and temporal simultaneity that only the comic book page can afford the graphic novel has a modernist structure even more complex than its characters tangled genealogy. Snyder enriches the mix by riffing on alt 80s periodicity--a simulated McLaughlin Group with Pat Buchanan opining on the nature of Dr. Manhattan is particularly funny--and a strategic 60s soundtrack. Indeed the credit sequence which scores a frozen tableaux history of the Watchmen and their precursors the Minutemen to the young Bob Dylan declaiming ""The Times They Are A-Changin "" is far wittier filmmaking than any of the movies excessively juicy fisticuffs or the escalating pandemonium Snyder orchestrates as Watchmen staggers toward its climactic Armageddon.Although the ending has been somewhat modified from the novels let it be said that Watchmen doesnt lack for self-confidence or even entertainment value. Its failure is one of imagination--although faithfully approximating Dave Gibbonss original drawings the filmmakers are unable to teleport themselves to the level of the original concept. Perhaps no one could have but it would have been fun to see what sort of mess Terry Gilliam (who hoped to make a movie version back in the 80s) or Richard Kelly (who surely took inspiration from Watchmen in conceptualizing his no less convoluted comic book saga Southland Tales) would have made of Moores magnum opus. Snyders movie is too literal and too linear. Social satire is pummeled into submission by the amplified pow-kick-thud of the sub-Matrix action sequences; not just metaphysics and narrative are simplified but even character is ultimately eclipsed by the presumed need for violent spectacle.The philosopher Iain Thomson (who valiantly brought Heideggers Being and Time to bear on his reading of Watchmen) maintained that Moore not only deconstructed the idea of comic book super-heroism but pulverized the very notion of the hero--and the hero-worship that comics traditionally sell. For all its superficial fidelity Snyders movie stands Moores novel on its head trying to reconstruct a conventional blockbuster out of those empty capes and scattered shards.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

Theyre kinetic stories that you can almost see move. That fun of course is more or less eliminated the moment that you transform a graphic novel into a movie. In the mid-1980s Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons Watchmen was a brain-jangingly dense ""visionary"" dystopian nightmare but part of what made it a generational touchstone is that it was the first graphic novel to do such a virtuoso job of treating its comic-book panels as fully fledged shots with rapid-fire crosscutting and a rhythmic verve that remains thrillingly cinematic. For years fanboys of every age have demanded that the big-screen adaptation of Watchmen be an act of artistic fidelity on par with the restoration of the Sistine Chapel. In a literal sense they may feel rewarded by Zack Snyders teemingly ambitious jam-packed movie version. A tall tale of fallen superheroes set against a Doomsday Clock countdown to impending nuclear war Watchmen as a movie serves up all (or most) of the graphic novels themes layers images backstories obfuscations and self-conscious tough-guy pulp-noir mystique. Leaping from the alleys of Manhattan to the pink wilderness of Mars it also has a feverish and deranged intricacy (which to be honest is the nice way to put it) and its key figures are not heroes in any conventional way. A few of them even act like the violently alienated sociopaths they are. Feel free to nitpick what Snyder has left out of Watchmen. Its hard not to be impressed by what he has wedged in. Yet even Watchmen fanatics may be doomed to a disappointment that results from trying to stay this faithful to a comic book. The opening-credit sequence has a marvelous audacity as it packs in the story of how the Minutemen -- masked crime fighters of the 1940s -- gave rise to their more nihilistic counterparts in the 50s. (The sequence is punctuated with historical events like the JFK assassination and set to the thrillingly recontextualized sounds of Bob Dylans ""The Times They Are A-Changin."") But once the film proper begins Snyder who did such a terrific job of adapting the solemn Olympian war porn of 300 treats each image with the same stuffy hermetic reverence. He doesnt move the camera or let the scenes breathe. He crams the film with bits and pieces trapping his actors like bugs wriggling in the frame. There are some angry bugs. We meet the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) a laughing brute of a superhero when he is murdered at home in the first of many bone-breakingly vicious fight scenes. The film then picks up on Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) a seething outcast hidden behind a mask of Invisible Man bandages with roving inkblot features as he seeks to uncover whos bumping off his fellow crime fighters. Rorschach speaking directly to the audience sounds like Clint Eastwood reading the purpler sections of Travis Bickles diary and when hes unmasked Haley full of spitting fury and loathing makes him a gripping hellion. Hes a far more vivid figure in fact than the Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson) or the sexy-wholesome Silk Spectre (Malin Akerman) who are like high school ingenues playing Clark Kent and Lois Lane. The most effective thing in the movie is Billy Crudups soft-voiced portrayal of Dr. Manhattan the towering blue radiation mutant whos a lonely ironic humanoid like 2001s HAL with nuked blood. On the page Watchmen was a paranoid mind-tripping pastiche of everything from The Incredible Hulk to Naked Lunch. But when characters who are knowing throwbacks are literally brought to life on screen they can seem more like half-hearted ripoffs. What gave the graphic novel its hint of metaphysical cachet is the way that it collapsed chronology. The 40s blurred into the 80s the present spilled into a desolate abyss -- and that telescoping of time became a metaphor for the inevitability of nuclear war. A no-future nihilism bled from the very grain of Moore and Gibbons pop vision of the 20th century. But thats a real problem for the movie since the Cold War nuclear fears of the 80s never did come to pass. Watchmen isnt boring but as a fragmented sci-fi doomsday noir it remains as detached from the viewer as it is from the zeitgeist.

Yeah you guys the ones who flooded my inbox with e-mails after I trashed Zack Snyders ""300"" wishing birth defects on my unborn children and suggesting that perhaps my husband isnt _ ahem _ keeping me satisfied. Yes Ive read ""Watchmen."" I understand why it matters culturally why its considered revolutionary in its exploration of flawed superheroes why it moved you. It moved me too. And still _ or rather because of that _ I found director Snyders adaptation hugely disappointing faithful as it is to the graphic novel. That rigid reverence should please purists _ tiny details from individual comic-book panels are recreated lovingly on the big screen _ but it also contributes to the films considerable bloat. At almost three hours ""Watchmen"" tries to cram in nearly everything writer Alan Moore and illustrator Dave Gibbons originally depicted but then the ending feels rushed. (And its slightly different. Thats all well say.) Much of what made the graphic novel so compelling with the cadence of the writing. (Moore wanted no part of the movie though so you wont see his name among the credits.) Theres a rhythm that sucks you in with time shifts and overlapping story lines often within the same panel. Theres a richness to the characters their philosophical debates and their origin stories. And theres something powerful about reading those words and internalizing them that doesnt translate cinematically such as when the tortured Rorschach says in voice-over the same thing he wrote in his journal ""Beneath me this awful city it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children."" The line feels like bad pulp fiction and like many others it clangs on the ear when spoken. (David Hayter and Alex Tse co-wrote the script.) If you havent read the book though youll be lost especially during the opening titles that breeze through the story of the Watchmens predecessors (to the tune of Bob Dylans ""The Times They Are A-Changin"" one of several obvious song choices). Those were the Minutemen mortals who dressed up in capes leather and latex to fight crime in New York in the 1940s. Now its 1985 _ or at least a twisted version of it where Richard Nixon remains president _ and members of a new generation of superheroes the Watchmen are caught in a murder mystery years after they disbanded. One of their own the right-wing military mercenary the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) has been thrown out the window of his high-rise apartment. Its up to his former colleagues including Rorschach (an eerie Jackie Earle Haley) the good-guy Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) the sexy Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) the brilliant Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) and the godlike Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) to dust off their get-ups and find out what happened even as the possibility looms of nuclear annihilation at the hands of the Soviets. Snyder has been hailed as a visionary director _ primarily by the studio releasing the movie _ but ""300"" and ""Watchmen"" both prove hes really a skilled mimic albeit one with visual flair. His violent New York is tangibly gritty but at the same time some of his larger set pieces like the ones that take place on Mars look distractingly cartoony. As for the performances Wilson brings smarts and pathos to his mensch of a character while Akerman as the woman he loves is too one-note. Crudups subtleties go to waste as the nude and radiantly blue Dr. Manhattan the only Watchman who really does have superpowers. Hes depicted here through motion-capture his soft voice providing sharp contrast with his characters muscular physique. Pity too because Dr. Manhattans complicated journey is perhaps the breathtaking story that ""Watchmen"" the novel has to offer. ""Watchmen"" a Warner Bros.

The graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons was a self-reflexive comment on the entire genre and explored the fine boundary between the masked vigilante the dirty civil servant and the dictatorial fascist. It has long been thought unfilmable a direct translation it was argued would be overlong punishingly bleak bewilderingly convoluted and wildly uncommercial. Which is exactly the film 300 director Zack Snyder has delivered. With the exception of an altered (and it must be said slightly improved) denouement Snyder and his screenwriters have changed almost nothing from the original text. Costumes sets visual effects the framing of shots and sequences all the choicest lines of dialogue even the music selections come directly from the novel. With all of these decisions taken out of the directors hands whats left for Snyder to do?Snyders biggest impact is felt in the action sequences which are also the films weakest scenes overstylised repetitive and pornographically violent. Violence is the major theme of Moores book its questionable efficacy in solving global problems the conflicted animalistic thrill of crushing ones enemies. Snyder rides roughshod over such subtleties Watchmen may be the nastiest blockbuster ever devised. It luxuriates in snapping bones and literal explosions of gore. Its here that the gulf between comic and movie becomes most clear Gibbonss drawings were often shocking but they served a purpose. Snyder employs violence for the rush and while this approach is sometimes brutally effective its also deeply crass.The casting throws up mixed results Patrick Wilson is agreeably vulnerable as Nite Owl while Jackie Earl Haley makes for a supremely effective unsettling Rorschach. But these two seasoned professionals stand out in a cast chosen for their physical similarity to Gibbonss drawings. Thankless female figurehead Silk Spectre demands an actress of real grace and vulnerability Malin Akermans bland soap-opera performance barely scratches the surface while Matthew Goodes vacuous portrayal of the power-hungry Ozymandias suggests annoyed playboy rather than Worlds Smartest Man. But they can hardly be blamed Snyder repeatedly fluffs the films emotional peaks blundering through on his way to another action setpiece.But try as he might Snyder cant sabotage the sheer majesty of the source material. The breadth and grandeur of Moores globe-spanning narrative still astounds and to see Gibbonss iconic images writ vast and messy across the screen packs an undeniable sentimental punch. Like the book theres an impressive visual and narrative density here cramming a bewildering amount of information into already overloaded scenes. The characters may be undermined by Snyders glib hasty approach but they still resonate as do the overriding themes of power corruption and human frailty. But Watchmen is still going to be the ultimate tough sell there will be those who view the film as a bewildering mishmash of underexplored themes thinly sketched characters and noisy excessive violence. Theyre probably right any work of popular art which demands prior knowledge must be deemed a failure. And yet theres something admirable about the entire enterprise its ungainly size its unrelenting weirdness its willful challenging intensity. Neophytes should probably steer clear but for longterm fans of the source work this will be a hugely pleasurable if ultimately unenlightening experience.

Perhaps its a time thing as it was potentially revolutionary when it came out - I was too busy reading the Beano and tales of Desperate Dan with his mighty chin and cow pie.So I went into this film without the air of if they havent completely done justice to/bettered the legendary comic book Im going to hate it which I feel is what causes many of the negative reviews aside from those who just cant sit through a 3 hour long film and without that view I have to say they did a perfect job of bringing the comic to life. The casting was perfect everyone looked practically identical to their comic book persona every shot and every line came directly from the comic and surprisingly it felt to me like hardly anything was missed out.Id give both the comic book and the film 4 stars neither outshines the other and both are slow going you have to be prepared to put yourself through the ride but rest assured you wont regret that you did.

The midget scene in the bathroom created a laugh for Me Did Doctor Manhattan need humans with him in Nam? Why didnt he save the pregnant woman?

I think that if you actually TRIED to pay attention and TRIED to get to actually know whats going on in the movie youd enjoy it. But from my personal opinion you really have to read the comic to REALLY enjoy it. I have not read the comic but about one time but my girlfriend had told me that she was a fan. So I shelled out 10 for her and me to go see the movie. I sat there and for the first lets say...hour or so it was quite boring. But as I sat there and I thought about what was going on and thought about the complexity and characters. It started to get more and more interesting. Though it was three hours by about half-way into the movie it was AWESOME. Rorschach (for all those idiots out there who dont know how to spell it cause you were too busy explaining to your boyfriend/girlfriend how much you want to leave so you can make a move on them...) was one of the most complexing and difficult characters to understand and for me the whole hour story of how he was meant to be WAS appropriate. But to me you have to know the whole story and the background of the story to be interested in ANYTHING. It just seems that most of the reviews on here were from people who wont take their time to pay attention to anything except themselves. I myself am not that patient either (I have ADD) but i still sit there for three hours. But boring is just what you dont like.

It was always going to polarise opinion but I found the sex and violence appropriate especially when explaining why Rorschach is the way he is. This film deals heavily with political philosophical problems such as the worth of human life the nature an worth of power the anarchic notion of society and how possibly to cure them. It created brilliant sociological considerations such as how we view what is essentially a God and how it views us. The fighting was great if a little matrix-esque and Im sorry but the first 20 minutes of this film make it clear that this is not the world we know without the condescending need to clarify it explicity - perhaps because this film assumes people arent thick. This film verges on a nihlism at some points and sure its not the most happy of films.But then this is a film that challenges that area of grey in such an environment it was unlikely there would be concrete disney style endings. But the film left on a good note - that if we forget our differences we have the potential for sympathy compassion and even peace. The fact this peace is forced upon the world is just another interesting talking point relating to peoples freedoms and their value.

Having never even heard of the Watchmen before this film came out I came into it expecting nothing but an action film-the majority of me went and saw it because my fiance wanted to with a bit of curiosity on my end. However I left the theater very satisfied. There was a lot of violence and I do think the sex scene was longer than really appropriate (although the spout of fire coming from Archie was pretty funny). However the story of Watchmen drew me in and left me thinking. The characters in the film also struck me as complex-I appreciated the backstories given for each character because it made me appreciate their personalities and ideals even more than if it had not been there. And I think it was these backstories that drew out the film and made it hard for people to sit through. Overall it was a good film. If you have the time I recommend taking a look at the themes of the film and applying them to actual history (like the attack on New York compared next to Pearl Harbor). Maybe it will be more appreciated in that light.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 24 2009RachelFeaturedI really enjoyed this film.

The film seems directionless the characters uniteresting and lacking depth (apart from maybe Rawshack) and ultimately the decisions and actions they take lacking explanation (which I am assured the comic does). My friends whove read it love the film. I think this is becasue they have the character and plot development in their heads that this film really doesnt have. As a result the set pieces/ action sequences just washed over me. Its too long. Its a fanboy film.

I even fell asleep at times because it got so boring. I rate it a 5/10 film. Some of the film is excellent. There IS however too much unnecessary sexual scenes that DO NOT add to the story. Remember T1 when Sarah Conner bedded the soldier from the future --- that had a point to it. In this film there was no point in the sex scenes and they were very boring. Some of the fighting is ace; again though it seemed pointless. There is not enough of Dr.Manhattan a man with unlimited power and to all intent and purpose a God. The film doesnt make clear that this is a parallel world though youd figure as much from some of the early suggestions i.e. political wins etc. It starts off well then there is a bit of fighting [pointless]; then there is an excellent piece about Vietnam then there is an hour of yap yap yappity boring yap followed by some excellent scenes on Mars and a pointless disappointing ending. I wouldnt recommend this film unless you love science fantasy; if you prefer sci-fi. like me and consider Aliens Predator The Matrix X-men Pitch Black etc to be good films then I think you will find this film a let down. It had such promise but it really lost its way. Its also a very dark film with no hope and nothing but the evil nature of Human reality. I say avoid this film.

"Who watches? Perhaps you - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Watchmen Who watches? Perhaps youMarch 6 2009|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe long-awaited film of Alan Moores classic comic book/graphic novel Watchmen is a work thats easier to ponder than enjoy. Director Zack Snyder has delivered a literal almost page-by-page transcription of Moore and Dave Gibbons messianic End of Days superhero epic. It gives you a lot to chew on in its 2 hours and 40 minutes.But as striking as it is to absorb and behold as literal as the adaptation is Watchmen rarely hits the thrilling or entertaining stride that Snyders 300 had from start to finish.Costumed heroes ""vigilantes"" have been illegal for years. Most of those who came to fame in the 1940s and 50s have hung up their capes tights and masks and slipped back into normal life.But now in their 60s somebody is killing them off. We see sadistic thug The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) give as good as he gets but die a violent death anyway. We hear masked Rorschach played by Jackie Earle Haley in a Dark Knight growl narrate his investigation into the crime.""One of us died tonight. Somebody knows why. Somebody knows.""In this alternate 1985 Vietnam was a ""win"" and Richard Nixon never left office. He and Kissinger are into their second decade in power with World War III still an eyeblink away. Americas secret weapon? Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) a nude blue nearly omnipotent hero-god who was once human but is losing his connection to humanity. And when his girlfriend the former Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) ditches him he exiles himself to Mars. The World War the world avoided may happen after all. The Watchmen wont be around to prevent it.""Its too late"" ethereal Dr. Manhattan prophesies. ""Always has been. Always will be.""Whos behind all this? Twisted ruthless Rorschach teams with his old friend the brainy less-violent Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson) to bust heads (and arms legs) to get to the bottom of the killings no matter that the world is about to end. Another ""mask"" the worlds smartest man Ozymandias (Matthew Goode) is enlisted. But hes in deep with Dr. Manhattans plan to solve the worlds energy problems in one fell swoop.Snyder fills the screen with eye candy. But the violence of the comic book is here too; brutal murders dismemberments attempted rape. The sex is graphic the violence more so.What Snyder and his team add to the mid-80s comic is a pop-cultural mashup sensibility. Bad impersonators abound from a heavily made-up Nixon to a feeble Ted Koppel and Lee Iacocca. On the soundtrack ""99 Luftballoons"" crashes into ""All Along the Watchtower.""The films dizzying array of flashbacks (also from the graphic novel) gives only a couple of actors enough time to shine. Haley is a ferocious presence Akerman is comic-book sex incarnate and Wilson does a nice Clark Kent turn as the reason-over-violence hero.At every turn long pauses in the action force us to chew on what the Brit Moore who went on to write the more obvious jeremiad V for Vendetta was getting at. Watchmen is Biblical and political and psychological and not the least bit whimsical. And after absorbing it over those two hours and 40 odd minutes the best you can say of the filmmakers is that they did what no team before could manage They got the movie made.""Whyd we do it?""""No one else would.""

By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach in Zack Snyders movie. Credit Illustration by Istvan Banyai The world of the graphic novel is a curious one. For every masterwork such as ""Persepolis"" or ""Maus"" there seem to be shelves of cod mythology and rainy dystopias patrolled by rock-jawed heroes and their melon-breasted sidekicks. Fans of the stuff are masonically loyal prickling with a defensiveness and an ardor that not even Wagnerians can match. One lord of the genre is a glowering hairy Englishman named Alan Moore the coauthor of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""V for Vendetta."" Both of these have been turned into motion pictures; the first was merely an egregious waste of money time and talent whereas the second was not quite as enjoyable as tripping over barbed wire and falling nose first into a nettle patch. In each case the cry from readers was that the movie was doomed by its treacherous departure from the original; Moore distanced himself from both productions and he has done so again with the new adaptation of ""Watchmen."" The movie was written by David Hayter and Alex Tse and directed by Zack Snyder but nowhere do we see the name of Moore. The bad news about ""Watchmen"" is that it grinds and squelches on for two and a half hours like a major operation. The good news is that you dont have to stay past the opening credit sequence--easily the highlight of the film. In contrast to all that follows it tells its tale briskly showing how a bunch of crime-fighters formed a secret club known as the Minutemen who in turn were succeeded by the Watchmen. This entails a whisk through history from the nineteen-forties to the eighties with shots of masked figures shaking hands with John F. Kennedy posing with Andy Warhol and so forth; these are staged like Annie Leibovitz setups and indeed just to ram home the in-joke we later see a Leibovitz look-alike behind a camera. But must we have ""The Times They Are A-Changin "" in the background? How long did it take the producers to arrive at that imaginative choice? And was Dylan happy to lend his name to a project from which all tenderness has been excised and which prefers to paint mankind as a bevy of brutes? As far as superheroes go twos company but three or more is a drag with no single character likely to secure our attention just ask the X-Men or the Fantastic Four or the half-dozen Watchmen we get here. There is Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) a slip of a psychopath his face often obscured by a bandagelike mask on which inky patches constantly blot and re-form. There is Dan (Patrick Wilson) better known as Nite Owl who keeps his old superhero outfit rubbery and sharp-eared locked away in his basement presumably for fear of being sued for plagiarism by Bruce Wayne. There is the Comedian real name Eddie Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) whose tragic end early in the film we are invited to mourn but who gets his revenge by popping up in innumerable flashbacks. There is Laurie who goes by the sobriquet of Silk Spectre as if hoping to become a top-class shampoo; she is played by Malin Akerman whose line readings suggest that she is slightly defeated by the pressure of pretending to be one person let alone two. Then there is Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) who likes to be called Ozymandias. Goode played Charles Ryder in last years ""Brideshead Revisited"" and I fear that even as Ozymandias murders millions from his Antarctic lair which he does at the climax of ""Watchmen"" Goodes floppy blond locks and swallowed consonants remain those of a young gadabout who might at worst twist the leg off his Teddy bear. Last and hugest is Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) who is buff buck naked and blue like a porn star left overnight in a meat locker. Whether his fellow-Watchmen have true superpowers as opposed to a pathological bent for fisticuffs I never quite worked out but this guy is the real deal. He was once a physicist but after an unfortunate mishap he found himself reintegrated as a radioactive being equipped to peer into the future nip to Mars for the afternoon and divide into multiples of himself for nuclear-powered group sex. I felt sorry for Crudup a thoughtful actor forced to spout gibberish about the meaning of time and much worse to have that lovely shy smile of his wiped by special effects. Dr. Manhattan is central to Moores chronological conceit which is that President Nixon (Robert Wisden) having used our blue friend to annihilate the Vietcong wins the Vietnam War and by 1985--the era in which the bulk of the tale takes place--is somehow serving a third term. ""Watchmen"" like ""V for Vendetta"" harbors ambitions of political satire and to be fair it should meet the needs of any leering nineteen-year-old who believes that America is ruled by the military-industrial complex and whose deepest fear--deeper even than that of meeting a woman who requests intelligent conversation--is that the Warren Commission may have been right all along. The problem is that Snyder following Moore is so insanely aroused by the look of vengeance and by the stylized application of physical power that the film ends up twice as fascistic as the forces it wishes to lampoon. The result is perfectly calibrated for its target group nobody over twenty-five could take any joy from the savagery that is fleshed out onscreen just as nobody under eighteen should be allowed to witness it. You want to see Rorschach swing a meat cleaver repeatedly into the skull of a pedophile and two dogs wrestle over the leg bone of his young victim? Go ahead. You want to see the attempted rape of a superwoman her bright latex costume cast aside and her head banged against the baize of a pool table? The assault is there in Moores book one panel of which homes in on the blood that leaps from her punched mouth but the pool table is Snyders own embroidery. You want to hear Moores attempt at urban jeremiad? ""This awful city it screams like an abattoir full of retarded children."" That line from the book may be meant as a punky retread of James Ellroy but it sounds to me like a writer trying much much too hard; either way it makes it directly into the movie as one of Rorschachs voice-overs. (And still the adaptation wont be slavish enough for some.) Amid these pompous grabs at horror neither author nor director has much grasp of what genuine unhyped suffering might be like or what pity should attend it; they are too busy fussing over the fate of the human race--a sure sign of metaphysical vulgarity--to be bothered with lesser plights. In the end with a gaping pit where New York used to be most of the surviving Watchmen agree that the loss of the Eastern Seaboard was a small price to pay for global peace. Incoherent overblown and grimy with misogyny ""Watchmen"" marks the final demolition of the comic strip and it leaves you wondering where did the comedy go? At first blush ""Leave Her to Heaven"" has no firmer purchase than ""Watchmen"" does on emotional truth. Released in 1945 John M. Stahls melodrama is showing at Film Forum in a restored print. A vampiric beauty named Ellen (Gene Tierney) gets her talons into Harland a vulnerable writer (Cornel Wilde) and refuses to let go. In the process she lets his disabled brother drown and aborts Harlands child by toppling down the stairs. Catch it on TV and you will find yourself complaining ""Please. No one behaves like that."" But theres the rub. Movies like Stahls were not made for TV. Their purpose unfolds only on the big screen where the blue-velvet skies and the lethally smooth waters of ""Leave Her to Heaven"" acquire the unquestioned clarity of a fever dream. A scornful James Agee reviewing it at the time said that the story might have been ""plausible enough in a dramatically lighted black-and-white picture""; but plausibility is not the issue and color is the lifeblood of the film. When Harland fresh off a train from the East wanders out into the New Mexico night still wearing a dark city suit we find ourselves at the border where noir and Western meet. As for the brothers death with Ellen looking on coolly in white robe and shades it remains one of the most perturbing in the history of Hollywood far scarier than anything in ""Watchmen""; where Snyder employs the latest tools of computer-generated imagery to jack up the foulness of his violence and thereby renders it more absurd Stahl takes the trouble to feel his way into the implications of three-strip Technicolor and thus into the more vivid hues of the heart. First used for a full-length movie (Rouben Mamoulians ""Becky Sharp"") a decade earlier and brought to blooming fruition in ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"" the new technology reached its astounding apogee in the lips of Gene Tierney as red as a witchs apple. Each frame of her seems to be hand-tinted as if she had ordered it. Her soft voice dies to a low whisper at the close of every phrase. ""I dont want anybody else to do anything for you"" she tells her husband. And with that the great conservative promise of postwar domesticity--the man newly arrived or returned waited upon by his woman--tightens into a threat.

By David Edelstein Published Feb 27 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Reading Alan Moore and Dave Gibbonss splashy blood-drenched superhero graphic novel Watchmen is a delirious experiencethe eye races forward circles back and darts around the panels while the brain labors to synthesize the data. Every breed of crusader is here working in tandem or at cross-purposes from the old-fashioned idealist in the cape and cowl to the paramilitary sociopath to the curvy femme in dominatrix garb. Now the narrator is Rorschach a grotty right-wing nihilist in a stocking-cap mask; now its Dr. Manhattan an iridescent blue giant in a cosmic funk who sits on Mars and sifts through lost time. While our heroes try to solve a murder mystery and forestall a nuclear Armageddon there are flashbacks and flashbacks-within-flashbacks; chunks of prose memoir; a parallel comic-book saga (a character is reading a pirate comic); glimpses of apocalyptic news events on TV screens; and backstories that are literally thatthey play out at the rear of the frame. When I read that Zack Snyder (300) the director of the movie had vowed to stay true to the originals spirit by moving the camera as little as possible (because you see comics are laid out a frame at a time) I had a Dr. Manhattansize premonition of doom. Moore and Gibbons used every tool they could invent to push their medium to its limitand their work is in the hands of people whove decided to cast off many of their own mediums tools in a misguided attempt at fidelity. How could Watchmen not be dead on the screen?  Patrick Wilson Gets Ready for Superstardom  Making the Watchmens New York  Notable Comic-Book Locations  New Yorks Finest Graphic Novels  Alex Robinsons Comic-Life Highlights It is at least an awe-inspiring corpse huge noisy gaseously distended by its own dystopia. The martial-arts action scenes are full of CGI slooooow motion capped with hyperfast smash-and-splatter. Fanboys will be pleased that the characters appear to have leaped from the page while the novels (dis)order of events has been meticulously preserved. In the overture a wiry dark figure heaves aging superhero the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and his smiley-face button out a skyscraper window. The outlawed-vigilante collective the Watchmen dust off their costumes and gear and get back in touchalbeit tentatively since theyre all weighed down by hopelessness and since no one but the paranoiac Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) thinks theres a conspiracy afoot. Dr. Manhattan (a special effect modeled on Billy Crudup) is the gloomiest Estranged from humanity convinced hes carcinogenic he does his Proust-on-Mars thing while his bodacious girlfriend Laurie a.k.a. Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) moves in with bespectacled sweetie Dan a.k.a. Nite Owl (Patrick Wilson). Without the big blue Doc to protect the U.S. the still-in-office Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden with a putty nose) watches the Soviets mass on the Afghan border and orders the bombers armed. Watchmen was conceived at the height of the eighties disarmament movement after Reagans election inspired waves of fresh doomsday scenarios and its resolution has dated badly Outlandish even then it now seems both insanely pessimistic and naive. As you watch the surviving characters slink away after a long two-and-three-quarters hours you might long for the relative giddiness of The Dark Knight. There are actors amid the effects all of them diligent. Under his excellent mask (the black splotches ever rearranging themselves) Haley would win a hammy-rasp contest against Christian Bale and as the preening demented billionaire Veidt a.k.a. Ozymandias Matthew Goode speaks with a lack of inflection thats very amusing. Crudup (or some dimension of him) underplays soulfully. Wilson cleans his oversize glasses with Clark Kentish earnestness. Bodacious Akerman is va-va-voooom in vinyl although she sounds like she was dubbed by Natalie Portmans Princess Amidala (a lust-killer). Elements come to fleeting life but numbness overtakes all. Alan Moore refused (in advance) to put his name on the movie which must have hurt Snyder and company terribly; theyve made the most reverent adaptation of a graphic novel ever. But this kind of reverence kills what it seeks to preserve. The movie is embalmed. Watchmen Directed by Zack Snyder. Warner Bros. Pictures. R. Share this story...

Finally unleashed from a much-publicized rights dispute between Fox and Warner Bros. ""Watchmen"" is less a fully realized comicbook epic than a sturdy feat of dramatic compression. Fans of Alan Moores landmark graphic novel concerning a ring of Gotham superheroes brought out of retirement by an impending nuclear threat will thrill to every pulpy line of dialogue and bloody act of retribution retained in director Zack Snyders slavishly faithful adaptation. But auds unfamiliar with Moores brilliantly bleak psychologically subversive fiction may get lost amid all the sinewy exposition and multiple flashbacks. After a victorious opening weekend the pics B.O. future looks promising but less certain beyond its core fanbase. Only illustrator Dave Gibbons is credited onscreen with authorship of the 12-part novel first published in single issues by DC Comics from 1986-87. As with previous adaptations of his work (""From Hell"" ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""V for Vendetta"") Moore no friend to Hollywood has distanced himself from this much-anticipated take on his notoriously unfilmable magnum opus. Set in an alternate 1985 with Richard Nixon still in office and nuclear war with the Soviet Union imminent its a densely plotted sociopolitically charged tale of costumed crime-fighters driven to existential despair by a world that seems both hard to save and hardly worth saving. Though it cries out for equally audacious cinematic treatment the novel instead has been timidly and efficiently streamlined by David Hayter (""X-Men"" ""X2 X-Men United"") and Alex Tse who struggle to cram as many visual and narrative details as possible into the films 161 minutes. Before it becomes a meditation on the nature and value of heroism in uncertain times ""Watchmen"" is first and foremost a whodunit. The victim is Edward Blake (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) formerly a vigilante known as the Comedian whos attacked by a masked intruder in his upper-story New York apartment and hurled to his death in suspended slow-motion. The murder triggers a reunion of sorts for several of the Comedians associates who before Nixon outlawed ""masks"" -- costumed superheroes -- were collectively known as the Watchmen. These include Dan Dreiberg (Patrick Wilson) a nebbishy gadget expert who longs for the days when he fought crime as the birdlike Nite Owl; his ex-partner Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley face concealed by a mask bearing an inkblot pattern) a raspy-voiced sociopath with a knack for breaking tough guys fingers; smug golden boy Adrian Veidt (Matthew Goode) who has successfully licensed and merchandised his identity as Ozymandias ""the smartest man in the world""; and sexy Laurie Jupiter (Malin Akerman) who had a superheros legacy forced on her by her mother and predecessor Sally (Carla Gugino). And then theres Lauries lover Jon Osterman better known as Dr. Manhattan. The product of a government accident that destroyed him yet also gifted him with regenerative superpowers this blue-hued godlike being has been deployed as a tactical weapon by the U.S. military. Inhabited with eloquent gravity and hyper-intelligent detachment (via motion-capture techniques) by Billy Crudup and endowed with a ripped physique -- and true to the source material an often visible set of cerulean genitalia -- hes easily the films most imposing creation. Of the group only Rorschach suspects a link between the Comedians death and the encroaching threat of global annihilation and fears a conspiracy to eliminate the Watchmen entirely. Subsequent twists -- an attempt on Veidts life a media disaster that sends Dr. Manhattan into self-imposed exile on Mars Rorschachs framing for murder -- only seem to justify the gathering paranoia. These threads are played out in a tight chronological continuum with a series of flashbacks that delve into each heros origins and unique worldview. As in the novel they provide some of the most gripping moments; Dr. Manhattans backstory in particular achieves a near-mystical awe thanks to the superb musical choices of Philip Glass ""Pruit Igoe"" and ""Prophecies"" (from ""Koyaanisqatsi""). From the clues and in-jokes embedded in Larry Fongs widescreen compositions and Alex McDowells vaguely retro Gotham-noir production design to the meticulous narrative framework and whole chunks of dialogue lifted from the novel theres no question ""Watchmen"" reps some sort of ultimate fanboys delight. Whether its Dreibergs flying owl ship or the staggering glass palace Dr. Manhattan conjures up on Mars the filmmakers have spared no expense in their mission to visualize every frame. Yet the movie is ultimately undone by its own reverence; theres simply no room for these characters and stories to breathe of their own accord and even the most fastidiously replicated scenes can feel glib and truncated. As ""Watchmen"" lurches toward its apocalyptic (and slightly altered) finale something happens that didnt happen in the novel Wavering between seriousness and camp and absent the cerebral tone that gave weight to some of the books headier ideas the film seems to yield to the very superhero cliches it purports to subvert. While Snyder still exults in gratuitous splatter (sawed-off limbs dangling human entrails a very random display of adolescent vampirism) he demonstrates a less oppressive directorial hand than he did in ""300"" avoiding that films ultra-processed digital look and shooting almost entirely on carefully mounted sets (the pic was lensed in Vancouver). William Hoys editing is fluent and measured even when it crosscuts rapidly in an attempt to echo the jumpiness of Gibbons comicbook panels. While none of the actors leaves an indelible impression Haleys feral ferrety Rorschach (narrating most of the film in gravelly voiceover) makes the most of his few unmasked appearances; Wilson is touching as a man emerging from physical and psychological impotence; and Goode is appropriately fey as the self-styled Veidt. Robert Wisden appears in a few scenes as Tricky Dick himself complete with comically elongated nose but doesnt quite give Frank Langella a run for his money. Slightly schizoid soundtrack is packed with hits from artists including Bob Dylan Simon amp; Garfunkel Leonard Cohen and Billie Holiday some of which are used in too distractingly obvious or ironic a fashion; the most period-appropriate tune of the bunch may be Nenas Cold War protest song ""99 Luftballons.""
