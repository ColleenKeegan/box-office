Those who arent in the cult of this popular genre fantasy not only wont understand what the previous sentence is about but may also wonder whats so great about perpetual life if it entails shlepping from one badly lit cheesily art-directed peat bog-colored century to another spouting hollow dialogue like ""Honors not in the weapon -- its in the man."" This latest chapter in the saga of Scottish superheroes (their clan banner might read ""Ageless Since 1518"") and their ongoing time-shifting sword-clanging martial arts-oriented battles finds the two brethren up against the evil Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne) a renegade immortal. Kells most potent weapon it turns out isnt his cutlery. Its the hysterical haute-villain inflections with which Payne declaims very very very long speeches about how difficult it is to stick around what with ""the endless numbing sameness of it all."" Isnt that the everlasting truth.

Unfortunately audiences today hidebound by more conventional thinking will dismiss this fourth installment in the ""Highlander"" franchise as a farrago on almost every creative level that looks like it was stitched together from three different movies whose cans got mixed up in the editing suite.

Film students of the future (say 100 years from now) will marvel at the prophetic treatment of narrative the free association in character development and the lateral approach to filmmaking norms demonstrated by ""Highlander Endgame."" Unfortunately audiences today hidebound by more conventional thinking will dismiss this fourth installment in the ""Highlander"" franchise as a farrago on almost every creative level that looks like it was stitched together from three different movies whose cans got mixed up in the editing suite. ""Highlander"" completists and air-conditioning addicts will be the only audience for this prior to a less mortal life in ancillary. Pic was not given any press previews by distrib Miramax. At the Alliance Atlantis promo screening caught in Montreal audience of popcorn munchers remained slack-jawed throughout. Nine producers four writers and seven editors bumped heads to come up with 88 minutes of footage (including credits) whereby Adrian Paul star of the 1990s TV spinoff takes the pic franchise over from Christopher Lambert. Task of um direction fell to Douglas Aarniokoski a protege of Robert Rodriguez whos also made several marketing trailers for Miramax/Dimension. Perhaps no one told him that ""Highlander Endgame"" was supposed to be a feature film; that may account for why it plays like a collection of clips in which the same characters happen to appear. Story whizzes back and forth among 16th and 17th century Scotland 17th century Italy 18th century Ireland Gotham 10 years ago and the present. Theres also an underground cavern called the Sanctuary a kind of Zen gas station where the few remaining Immortals strap themselves to uncomfortable metal frames and fill up their spiritual tanks. Before you can say ""unleaded"" fellow Immortal Jacob Kell arrives and separates his colleagues heads from their bodies upping his personal score to 600-plus. Jacob is on a mission to become the sole Immortal on the planet and is also majorly pissed with fellow time traveler Connor MacLeod (Lambert) who accidentally skewered Jacobs dad in Scotland back in 1555. That Connor did this while escaping from imminent immolation at the stake engineered by Jacob is apparently irrelevant. Jacob has been pursuing Connor across the centuries killing his loved ones along the way (e.g. Sheila Gish with scarcely a minutes screen time) and even signing up on his team Kate (model-singer Lisa Barbuscia) an 18th century squeeze of Connors protege Duncan (Paul). Kate now an Immortal known as Faith with her own New York designer label is angry at Duncan for robbing her of a normal life and motherhood. Duncan is angry at Connor for leaving him alone and opting out of Immortal society. Halfway through the picture Connor Duncan and Jacob finally meet in a graveyard but Connor wimps out of taking Jacob on. Its another half-hour of chaotic window-dressing before the final duel takes place but first Connor and Duncan have to work out their differences as only one Immortal is allowed to battle another. The sheer raggedness of the plotting -- and the pics cynical disdain toward audiences -- is staggering with no dramatic benefits emerging from the beam-me-up script. Thesps resolutely play it for the moment with Payne crunching out lines like ""You are my flock; you nourish my soul"" (before decapitating his dinner guests) and the highly photogenic Barbuscia looking like shes strayed off a fashion shoot. Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen makes a brief impression with his trademark whiplash style as one of Jacobs posse. With Lambert locked into autodrive the only one who seems to be seriously working for his paycheck is Paul but hes paddling upstream against the boneheaded script and average f/x. Doug Milsomes handsome widescreen lensing of Romanian locations serves only to emphasize the lack of craft at other levels. Cutting is down to the bone all the way.

Those who arent in the cult of this popular genre fantasy not only wont understand what the previous sentence is about but may also wonder whats so great about perpetual life if it entails shlepping from one badly lit cheesily art-directed peat bog-colored century to another spouting hollow dialogue like ""Honors not in the weapon -- its in the man."" This latest chapter in the saga of Scottish superheroes (their clan banner might read ""Ageless Since 1518"") and their ongoing time-shifting sword-clanging martial arts-oriented battles finds the two brethren up against the evil Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne) a renegade immortal. Kells most potent weapon it turns out isnt his cutlery. Its the hysterical haute-villain inflections with which Payne declaims very very very long speeches about how difficult it is to stick around what with ""the endless numbing sameness of it all."" Isnt that the everlasting truth.

Starring Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul. Directed by Doug Aarniokoski. Written by Joel Soisson. (R. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Highlander"" a 1985 action adventure starring Christopher Lambert was hardly a pinnacle in modern cinema. And yet two sequels were spawned from that saga of a secret tribe of combative immortals -- as well as a TV series that ran from 1993-96. There was even a second TV series ""Highlander The Raven"" about a female immortal. Now just when the world seemed safe from decapitations Lambert and costumes hewn from burlap bags we get ""Highlander Endgame"" the fourth and supposedly final film in a series that lost steam long ago. Lambert is back looking glum ghostlike and thick with age. He plays Connor MacLeod a weary immortal who hasnt rested since his mother burned at the stake in 16th century Scotland. The perpetrator fellow immortal Jacob Kell (Bruce Payne) is also roaming the globe as is Connors clan member Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul star of the TV series). Immortals die only when their heads are lopped off with a sword at which time their power transfers to the immortal who killed them. Kell has slain 661 immortals making him the baddest of the bad. ""Highlander Endgame"" tends to leapfrog the epochs with glib dispatch. Sixteenth century Scotland plays a big role with the final showdown taking place in 2000. One of the benefits of time travel -- well its more like a distraction -- is seeing the wigs costumes and facial hairpieces that get pasted on Paul. An adequate actor with romantic Douglas Fairbank looks Paul is the saving grace here and he has a hot sex scene with full-lipped Lisa Barbuscia playing the woman he makes immortal so he wont be alone. ""You forced this on me"" she accuses him centuries later. ""The numbing sameness of it all"" But dont expect philosophical ruminations on immortality. Samuel Beckett this aint. Directed by first-time moviemaker Doug Aarniokoski ""Highlander Endgame"" is a video game come to life structured mostly from action scenes that achieve the ""numbing sameness"" that Barbuscia laments. The formula is simple swordplay martial arts anthem-rock music and the occasional throwaway lines on the order of ""Hasta la vista."" Even the sound effects get tiring How many times can you hear swords being clanged yanked from the Earth or sinking squishily into quivering flesh without getting bored? -- Advisory This movie contains excessive violence partial nudity and sexual situations. ..
