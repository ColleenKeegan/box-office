Never strong on story or character the found-footage Paranormal Activity series has stuck around by dint of craft alone--no small feat when you consider how these films always felt like they were made by amateurs over single weekends with a few customer-grade video cameras and some fishing wire. Each time a new gimmick would turn the concept on its head the wandering ""pool cam"" or the oscillating ""fan cam."" Finally though director Gregory Plotkin and his small phalanx of screenwriters have choked the ghost to death with this awful sixth installment such a tepid bomb that it triggers catcalls from paying audiences. The main failure--obvious from the start--is too much money Spectral black goo floats in the air like motes of dust a computer-generated effect that feels like a breach of trust when weve come to expect less. The generic suburban banality feels especially deadening this time around as yet another family with a curious kid finds itself terrorized by loud bangs at night. The Ghost Dimension introduces an obnoxious set of adult bros one of them the man of the house the other his dumped sib whos come to crash at Christmas time. Their discovery of an old video camera (complete with tapes) is painfully dull and the rest of the casts porn-level acting doesnt help to liven things up. Worse still is the scripts pillaging of the far-superior Poltergeist complete with an extra-dimensional portal in a childs bedroom a blond girl who becomes a vessel for evil and a late-inning heroic mom. The pleasures of a Paranormal movie should be a lot simpler. You wont be squirming in your seat due to anything but boredom.

Murray Brit Shaw Dan Gill Ivy George; Director Gregory Plotkin; Release Date 10/23/2015; Runtime (in minutes) 95; MPAA Rating R Posted October 25 2015 -- 1141 AM EDT See also See the latest trailer for Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension There is a scene around midway through this tale of yet another suburban family beset by supernatural forces when the audience sees found footage of characters watching video material they shot earlier in which they themselves watch found footage filmed two decades before. Is this demonstrative of how complex the Paranormal Activity franchises mythology has become? Or a sly acknowledgment by the films makers that the found footage genre which the original 2007 Paranormal Activity did so much to popularize really has now choked on its own tail creatively speaking? Either way it offers evidence that producer Jason Blums promise that this sixth entry in the series will be the last makes a lot of sense. Or does it? Certainly there are signs of franchise-fatigue in Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension which features egregious CGI and also introduces the rather ludicrous concept of a custom-made camera with a special lens capable of filming ghoulies (suck on that Instagram). But the cast which includes Nashville actress Brit Shaw and 5 Second Films comedy troupe member Olivia Taylor Dudley do enough that you care whether they live or die and the finale nicely invokes the ""weird"" spirit of horror author H.P. Lovecraft albeit in a decidedly budget-conscious fashion. Most of all Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension is packed with cheap but nonetheless effective jump scares. If this is the last in the series then the franchise has succeeded in going out with a bang -- a bunch of them actually and at least a couple should have you involuntarily twitching in your seat.

Credit Paramount Pictures The folks behind ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension"" say that the film is the last in the found-footage horror series and if so the franchise concludes with more of an afterthought than a finale. While this installment -- the sixth if you include a spinoff -- does acknowledge what slim legacy the series might have it merely retains the qualities of the previous entries without adding much of significance.A young affluent California family -- Ryan (Chris J. Murray); his wife Emily (Brit Shaw); and their 6-ish daughter Leila (Ivy George) -- are settling into a sizable new home. Its Christmastime and Ryans mustachioed somewhat hapless brother Mike (Dan Gill) who has just broken up with a girlfriend is moving in for a while. When Ryan and Mike find a video camera and a cache of old videos left by the previous residents they unearth a strange history some of it featuring Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Brown) the young girls haunted by the malevolent and largely unseen wraith Tobi in ""Paranormal Activity 3.""

The child actor Aiden Lovekamp from ""Paranormal Activity 4"" makes an appearance but not the appealing Katie Featherston whose presence enhanced other chapters in the series. Humor and jagged jump cuts both series staples are in abundant supply.Most ""Paranormal"" installments raise the technology bar a notch higher than their predecessor often to diminished charm. ""Paranormal 4"" played with Skype; ""The Ghost Dimension"" ushers in 3-D which aside from floating specter dust an impalement and tricks with flying furniture doesnt bring much to the party. Nor does the plot. But then the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies have always been about carnival-ride sensations the narrative through-line secondary. Thats fortunate because those seeking closure to what continuity there has been will go home mostly disappointed.""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Photo Paramount Pictures Its somewhat shocking to discover that this latest Paranormal Activity -- the sixth and supposedly final one in the series -- is the first to take advantage of 3-D. The technologys ability to enhance depth seems like it would have been perfect for the extreme-wide-angle surveillance-footage aesthetic of these movies. But perhaps it flew against their DIY ethos The first Paranormal Activity after all made back in 2009 was a low-budget Slamdance title that wore its cheapness on its sleeve with its digital fixed-camera look at a family tormented in their new McMansion by unseen forces. The concept was not just novel but scary in its own right The unfeeling stillness of the frame contrasted unnervingly with the hysteria of what was happening within it. Novel yes. Endlessly repeatable no. With each installment the basic Paranormal Activity concept has felt more and more tired especially as the characters have seemed infinitely replaceable. (Yes thatas par for the course with slasher flicks a| but these arenat really slasher flicks.) Still in each new movie you sense the filmmakers trying to find new ways to get old scares. Number four did interesting stuff technically using Skype and toying with wind (and other things) hitting the microphones. The Marked Ones (a.k.a. number five) ventured beyond the bland middle-class milieus of the previous films and placed the horror in a tough neighborhood in Oxnard CA. None of these movies really worked but they had their moments. Ghost Dimension offers an interesting paradox. Plot-wise it doesnat even try to reinvent or revitalize itself. We get yet another bland suburban family tormented by demons with dad Ryan (Chris J. Murphy) mom Emily (Brit Shaw) and their young daughter Leila (Ivy George) getting ready for Christmas with nary a care in the world. But weall also need some extra hands to hold cameras and run around screaming in front of them so the film adds Ryanas hipster-y brother Mike (Dan Gill) and Emilyas beautiful blonde friend Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley) to the mix as houseguests. (Skylaras in town apparently on a yoga retreat. I donat know why this detail stuck out at me. Maybe theyare setting us up for Paranormal Activity Yoga Retreat.) Yeah the people are here mostly to run around and look around corners and scream but one still wishes a foolishly a that these movies would find a way to make them do so plausibly. The filmas start-stop approach to narrative wonat allow it By about the third time it cuts away in the middle of some sudden horrific event to the next day when things seem to have (hilariously) returned to normal you might find yourself groaning. Unlikely human behavior is always a challenge with these movies and Ghost Dimension practically bathes in it. Maybe thatas its way of involving the viewer The seriesas patented longueurs allow for plenty of quiet downtime for restless horror audiences to start shouting at the screen. Still though thereas something here. Occasionally the frame comes alive. Early on Ryan and Mike find a box with an old clunky camcorder in it and the lined old-school image turns what weare seeing into something fuzzier more uncertain. Suddenly the mundane objects of the home seem to float hovering between us and the screen. And with this ancient camera we can also now sorta-maybe-kinda see the ghosts and demons and otherworldly apparitions tormenting the humans. Itas surprisingly unnerving especially in 3-D and as a result there are probably a few more effective jump-scares in this installment than there were in the last several Paranormal Activity films. Unfortunately thereas still the matter of the people in the movie. If only Ghost Dimension spent more time in the ghost dimension and less time in the people dimension we might have had something.

(Paramount Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 23 2015Paranormal Activity The Ghost DimensionStarring Chris J. Murray Brit Shaw Ivy George Olivia Taylor Dudley and Michael Krawic. Directed by Gregory Plotkin. At GTA theatres. 88 minutes. 14AThe low rumbling sound throughout Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension may indeed signal the approach of Toby the demon with the dumbest name since Adam Sandlers Little Nicky.Or it could just be a noisy refrigerator icemaker as speculates one of the Fleeges the latest family to be spooked by Toby and his possessed stooges.Article Continued BelowMe I think its the grinding gears of a rusty cash register that can no longer ka-ching -- or scare -- the way it once reliably did. The original Paranormal Activity a minimalist 2007 chiller by Oren Peli worked well precisely because of what it didnt show about a California home haunting.This sixth and supposedly final chapter (dont believe it) long delayed in release and clumsily directed by series editor Gregory Plotkin now tries to make a virtue out of showing us everything ""For the first time you will see the activity"" the ad line goes.Thats one big fat fib probably circulated by Toby who no doubt is also behind the cynical cash grab to present this in UP3D (Utterly Pointless 3D).Weve seen glimpses of this kid-capturing coven for at least a couple of episodes the main difference this time being that Tobys crew is noisy and messy leaving vile black yuk on walls ceilings and floating in the air.The victims du jour are Ryan and Emily Fleege (Chris J. Murphy and Brit Shaw) their 7-year-old daughter Leila (Ivy George) Ryans visiting dude-man bro Mike (Dan Gill) and a buxom blond family pal named Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley) who apparently is big on yoga. The Fleeges are preparing to celebrate Christmas in their new Santa Rosa home but then Ryan and Mike stumble upon a cache of old VHS tapes left by previous occupants along with the ancient camera that shot it. Yep its the old found-footage conceit as the Fleeges find out what happened to their predecessors and whats about to happen to them now.The pack-written plot follows numbing formula haunting denial photography religion screaming fade to black. The jump scares are rudely effective but you could do them at home by having your cat leap at you when you open a closet. This series jumped the shark -- maybe that should be jumped the dark? -- following its not-bad third chapter.True to series form the Fleeges always carry a camera and never switch on a light. They also continue to allow their kid to sleep alone even after she babbles demonic talk and scrawls satanic symbols on her bedroom wall.What passes for novelty is the arrival of a Roman Catholic priest (Michael Krawic) who doesnt want to perform an exorcism. When did that ever happen in a horror movie?Instead the padre plans to nab Toby by dousing him with salt throwing a wet bed sheet over him and then roasting him or something like that. Im confused Is he capturing a demon or preparing a Thanksgiving turkey?And speaking of turkey . . .

"Review Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension adds scares in 3-D - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension still adds scares six films in Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension still adds scares six films in Paramount Pictures Ivy George plays Leila in the movie ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension."" Ivy George plays Leila in the movie ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension."" (Paramount Pictures) Noel Murray Back in 2009 Paramount sold the first ""Paranormal Activity"" with a trailer showing big audiences watching the movie and freaking out. The sixth film in the series ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension"" follows the same path as that of its predecessors which means that its fully capable of making a theater shriek -- provided that this weakening franchise can still pack the house.Director Gregory Plotkin (formerly the series editor) doesnt vary the ""Paranormal Activity"" pitch much. The style here is still what could be called ""found footage plus"" with surveillance cameras and first-person hand-held shots capturing trained actors giving polished performances broken up by the occasional loud noise or startling shadow. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Chris J. Murray stars as Ryan Fleege a Santa Rosa game designer who moves into a McMansion with his wife Emily (Brit Shaw) and daughter Leila (Ivy George). The Fleeges find a box of old videotapes documenting the supernatural encounters experienced by the characters from ""Paranormal Activity 3"" -- along with a special camera that can see the foggy nether-beasties creeping through their home. Soon theyre pointing all their equipment at Leila who seems to be communicating at night with the demon ""Toby."" ""The Ghost Dimension"" is the first of the franchise to be made in 3-D which matters most in the movies final third when the evil plaguing the Fleeges manifests as whooshing spirits headed straight toward the camera. At its most basic level the ""Paranormal Activity"" formula still has some kick with its combination of creepy lo-fi video and tasteful suburbia creating some strong unsettling dissonance.

The story and approach is too familiar and the jump-scares and comic relief (the latter provided by Dan Gill as Ryans bumbling brother) demand a large group of people stoking one anothers reactions.As a helpful priest explains in ""The Ghost Dimension"" evil entities ""feed on fear.""

TWITTER Attempting to unravel many of the knotty questions raised by the franchiseas convoluted mythology this sixth installment in the series brings events to an overdue conclusion. An unprecedented phenomenon when it debuted from Paramount in 2009 (following the substitution of a revised ending) Oren Pelis Paranormal Activity launched a six-film franchise based on an urban legend-like haunted house tale. Earning more than 193 million worldwide on a 15000 budget it also helped spawn the sometimes regrettable found-footage horror genre. So Pelis and producer Jason Blums decision to bring the series to a conclusion with this final installment may seem surprising in comparison to the typical strategy of overexploiting a horror franchise but in truth Peli hasnt directed another film in the series since the original moving on to a producing role instead while Blumhouse has taken the low-budget high-concept Paranormal Activity model and created similar successes with horror series The Purge Sinister and Insidious. With their first 3D release the producers turn the directing role over to longtime Paranormal Activity series editor and producer Gregory Plotkin (making his feature directorial debut) although this time out Paramount is launching a very different distribution strategy for the film. Along with its upcoming Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse release the studio has negotiated much briefer theatrical windows than normal with a group of theater chains reportedly in return for a percentage of the stepped-up VOD release receipts. Other exhibitors have emphatically spurned the arrangement however limiting the opening to an estimated 1600 theaters. The low-budget feature will also be directly competing with Vin Diesels blockbuster-scaled supernatural thriller The Last Witch Hunter leaving the opening-weekend outcome for The Ghost Dimension uncharacteristically uncertain. Read more Paramount AMC Theatres Strike Unprecedented Pact to Shorten Release Windows Rather than meaningfully reconnecting with the most compelling characters from the earlier films the final installment returns to the original house haunted by the demonic entity known as Toby or more precisely the property since the home in Santa Rosa Calif. where Katie (Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Brown) were indoctrinated into a mysterious cult burned down when they were children. The new owners of the rebuilt home are Ryan (Chris J. Murray) and Emily (Brit Shaw) a married couple with a young daughter. As Christmas quickly approaches Leila (Ivy George) is excited when her uncle Mike (Dan Gill) arrives to spend the holiday with his brother and sister-in-law along with Emilys friend Skyler (Olivia Taylor Dudley). While adorning the house with decorations removed from storage Mike finds an 80s-era custom-built VHS camera and a box of tapes. Technophile Ryan gets the device working and discovers that its sophisticated lens reveals some type of mysterious energy field manifesting in the house thats only visible to the video-cam a phenomenon lamely described as ""spirit photography."" Playing back the tapes Ryan and Mike review disturbing footage of Kristis and Katies grandma Lois (Hallie Foote) and a strange man training the girls to communicate with the spirit world. As the manifestation of the aberrant energy field intensifies in his home and Leila begins speaking aloud to an ominous invisible friend Ryan begins to suspect that the same evil presence that stalked Katie and Kristi may be after his daughter as well. Narratively thematically and stylistically The Ghost Dimension barely diverges from the format of the first three films as nervous homeowners take up video cameras to record the mysterious occurrences that appear to be targeting their loved ones. Even at this late stage in the evolution of the franchise logical lapses in filmmaking technique undercut the integrity of the found-footage format but continuity was never one of the series strong points a shortcoming easily forgiven by fans. Read more Top Theater Group Wont Oppose Paramounts VOD Revolution What may be less acceptable however is the films unaccountably weak effort to sort out the mythology concerning the series of demonic hauntings instead stacking the deck with a tricked-out plot device thats an awkward fit with the more traditionally supernatural events that occurred earlier. Primarily referencing and occasionally depicting events from Paranormal Activity 3 the current films team of four screenwriters replacing longtime scripter Christopher Landon fails to sufficiently clarify the actions and motivations of the series principal characters who at this point have practically vanished from the storyline anyway. Performances are fairly perfunctory overall never achieving a level of terror commensurate with the threats that the characters face. Plotkin proceeds much in the manner of the foregoing lineup of rotating directors setting up a chronology of nightly video shoots roaming the house with a handheld camera then relying primarily on loud noises and jump scares for impact although the 3D format allows for more sophisticated special effects particularly those recorded by the mysterious video camera. Some may remain nostalgic for the low-budget practical effects that enlivened the first few movies while a major ripoff of a climactic scene from a classic supernatural thriller may even turn off those loyalists as well limiting Paranormal Activitys legacy to the first few installments. Overall its been a fairly entertaining run but its unclear whether the films as a whole will ever rate as a classic horror franchise although it may be unwise to rule out any further occurrences of Paranormal Activity at this point.

So this is the way a franchise ends. The sixth and allegedly final installment of the massively money-minting found-footage horror series ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension"" offers little more than a distant whimpering echo of a film property that once made such a bang. Distinguished mostly by the addition of 3D and an unusual distribution window the film is scheduled to hit VOD less than three weeks after leaving cinemas to the chagrin of a few theater chains. It will be interesting to see if the experimental release strategy pays off in the long run and its not hard to imagine the ""Paranormal"" series living on thanks to the multiplicity of new digital content platforms. For all the memorable scares it manages to cook up ""The Ghost Dimension"" might have actually worked better as a series of GIFs. Though it hardly invented the found-footage conceit the original ""Paranormal Activity"" certainly helped elevate it to the status of a proper and profitable subgenre with its own unique tropes and cinematic language. Subsequent sequels might have diminished its legacy a bit -- though last years oft-maligned Latino-themed offshoot ""The Marked Ones"" was refreshingly unserious -- yet nothing compares to the feature-length shrug that director Gregory Plotkin offers this time around. There may well be new and novel ways to spark audience shivers from not-so-bright homeowners inexplicably using their cameraphones to check out bumps in the night but this series clearly has neither the patience nor the inclination to look for them anymore. While it does answer some lingering questions about the franchises overarching mythology ""The Ghost Dimension"" spends most of its running time dully retracing old steps introducing yet another suburban family -- father Ryan Fleege (Chris J. Murray) mother Emily Fleege (Brit Shaw) and 7-year-old daughter Leila (Ivy George) -- as they prepare for Christmas in their enormous new Santa Rosa house. Joining them for a few weeks is Ryans brother Mike (Dan Gill) a commodiously mustached hipster recovering from a breakup and Skylar (Olivia Taylor Dudley) a young blonde woman of unclear relation to the family in town for some sort of yoga retreat that allows her to abruptly disappear from the film for long stretches. Like all ""Paranormal"" subjects the Fleeges are chronic videographers and Ryan gets to flex some new photographic muscles when he finds a old-school camcorder stashed in the garage along with a collection of old family videos. In addition to looking charmingly retro the camera also picks up a strange number of odd vibrations and apparitions around the house that are invisible to the naked eye as well as more modern devices. (Not only are these Ghost-o-Vision sequences the films most creative they also provide it with its only non-financial reason to employ 3D.) At first the camera only shows Rorschach-like blobs of debris floating through the air but its not long before everything starts to go haywire. Young Leila develops a sudden allergy to Christian iconography and begins talking to an imaginary friend named Toby; Ryan and Mike pop in the old home movies only to discover footage of a strange cult with two telepathic children; and since even malevolent demons have a soft spot for vintage arcade games the pinball machine starts turning on by itself. A certain degree of character stupidity is to be expected in a paint-by-numbers horror pic so of course Ryan progresses through his collection of Sinister Mystery Videos That Might Explain Everything at a seeming rate of one per day and of course the family lets Leila continue to sleep alone in her room even after she draws pagan symbols on her wall and icily intones ""Hes going to take me away ... "" But at times the films multiple scripters almost seem to forget what has transpired in the scene previous Characters can observe multiple instances of supernatural activity one night then immediately revert into ""Its probably just a coincidence""-skeptics the next morning. Without much spark to the jump scares the film turns to hoary exorcism tropes and CGI fantasias in the later going undoing much of the low-key believability that was essential to ""Paranormals"" appeal in the first place. Youngster George makes for a very effective creepy kid when called upon though her adult counterparts fail to leave much of an impression. The below-the-line crew doesnt have a whole lot to work with considering the film never once leaves the familys property yet the environs are as bland as can be and one would have to trawl through the deepest recesses of Romanian art cinema to find a film with as many static silent shots of empty rooms and unfurnished hallways.

This sixth entry in the found-footage franchise suggests a fatal level of series fatigue The more we pay attention to and fear demons a priest warns in ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension"" the more power we give them. This limp sixth entry in the once-groundbreaking horror series suggests the opposite is true as well the less frightened we are by a movie thats supposed to give us the chills the less reason it has to exist. (Paramount incidentally is trying to pass this one off as the fifth in the series as though 2014s ""Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones"" doesnt count but that movie totally ties into the story making this new entry an even half-dozen.) Also Read Paranormal Activity Last Witch Hunter Show Strong Social Media Presence Ahead of Opening Weekend Taking the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies out of the hands of screenwriter Christopher Landon who shepherded the franchise (for better or for worse) through the second through fifth entries first-time director Gregory Plotkin and a quintet of credited writers circle back to familiar territory this time around taking us back into a generic suburban McMansion where spooky doings are afoot. As such its a movie whose plot points you can basically tick off a list from the discovery of a box of mysterious videotapes to the eventual ""Night 1"" title card as the house fills up with cameras hoping to capture the bizarre goings-on. (Yes this is still a found-footage horror series which means we will inevitably encounter moments in which characters run for their lives without ever stopping to put down the dang camera.) Also Read Paranormal Activity Finale Gambles on Low Box Office High VOD Barely earning its R rating ""Ghost Dimension"" relies on the old stand-by of jump scares with poltergeists suddenly whooshing and whomping loudly and suddenly through the scene. Despite Plotkins background as an editor (he also has producer credits on the three previous ""PA"" movies) these jump scares are so utterly predictable that they might as well be heralded on-screen with a bouncing ball and an appearance by the Oogieloves. Its Christmastime and married couple Ryan (Chris J. Murray) and Emily (Brit Shaw) and their young daughter Leila (Ivy George) have welcomed holiday guests Mike (Dan Gill wearing a mustache that makes him a dead ringer for ""Brady Bunch""-era Robert Reed) and New Age-y yoga instructor Skyler (Olivia Taylor Dudley ""Chernobyl Diaries""). While stringing up lights Mike finds that box of tapes which also contains an enormous old-school analog video camera. Ryan sees things floating in the middle of his living room while using that camera -- he thinks its a flaw but later realizes that the device has twice the usual picture tubes and a very complicated system of lenses. As time passes he realizes that the camera is picking up a ghostly presence in the house and thats about the moment when Leila starts talking to invisible friends and doing charming things like burying rosaries in the yard or ripping up bibles in the middle of the night. (When people talk about faith-based cinema they usually mentions movies like ""Gods Not Dead"" or ""Woodlawn"" but does any genre take devils and religion as seriously as horror?) Also Read Blumhouse to Co-Produce 6 Korean-Language Genre Films Over Next 5 Years The tapes meanwhile drag those evil moppets Katie and Kristi back into the story suggesting that somehow from decades earlier they can see whats going on in Ryan and Emilys house. Does any of this weird stuff raise sufficient alarm or induce the parents to call a clergyperson or an exterminator or the Ghostbusters before its too late? Of course not. Soon Leila is going into weird trances and creating doorways to alternate dimensions on her bedroom walls with crayon -- which incidentally her parents dont even try to erase with a little 409 and some paper towels -- and by the time a local priest is making holy water in the spa tub and making salt circles on the hardwood floors it might be too late to save everyone. And if youve ever seen any of the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies you can guess where this is all going down to the final shots. The movies climactic exorcism jamboree provides some relief from the movies overwhelming dullness and the final segments put the movies 3-D to use but overall ""Paranormal Activity The Ghost Dimension"" feels like the last wheeze of a played-out series. When the time on your watch becomes more compelling than the timestamp on the movies video footage its time to pack it in. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
