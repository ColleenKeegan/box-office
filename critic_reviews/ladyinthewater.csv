An animated prologue berates arrogant humanity for wilfully ignoring the mystical insights of the sea creatures who were once our brethren. Cut to modern-day Philadelphia where apartment block janitor Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti in full-on st-st-stuttering schlump mode) is riled that somebodys been in the swimming pool after hours. Not just anybody of course but a sea-nymph or narf (Bryce Dallas Howard reprising wide-eyed innocence from The Village only wetter) who calls herself Story and says shes from the Blue World. All of which is moderately intriguing until its time to ask the Korean lady on the second floor what it all means prompting her (Asian Wisdom?) to regale us with the legend of a water-faerie wholl come to inspire a human vessel to greatness before being retrieved by a giant eagle called the Great Eatlon. Unless that is the red-eyed killer scrunts in the undergrowth get her first...It would be nice to credit Shyamalan with having enough faith in the power of storytelling to invent his own mythology but the high-handed hectoring insistence on unlocking mankinds hidden potential really does inspire resistance while the rigmarole of explaining the myth then applying it to the world of the astonishingly gullible apartment dwellers proves grindingly uninvolving when shoe-horned into suspense thriller format. Although Chris Doyles seaweed-hued cinematography gives the proceedings a certain visual allure Giamattis emotional commitment to the role only illuminates the hollowness of the material which offers a plum self-serving part to Shyamalan the performer. What was he thinking? This isnt just duff its career-threatening catastrophic.

Lady in the Water 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In the minds of many film goers M. Night Shyamalan sprang fully formed from The Sixth Sense in 1999 but he wrote and directed two earlier features the 1992 Indian-American coming-of-age film PrayingWith Anger and six years later an openly mystical kid flick called Wide Awake. The latter is an awkward curiosity well-meaning but wooden. Its main character is a 10-year-old boy whose grandfather has just died pitching him on a heaven-bent quest to prove the existence of God. Shyamalans subsequent movies have been categorized as horror suspense or Hitchcockian -- and until now capped with killer twists -- but they all hark back to the metaphysical themes that have haunted him from the start. His work is as notable for its unwavering sense of mission as its thoughtful craftsmanship. It pains me therefore to call Lady in the Water a failure. Calling it a noble failure -- or a near-failure rescued from the brink by Shyamalans consummate cinematic eye and Paul Giamattis beautiful anguished performance -- might soften the blow but not enough. The movie simply fails as a story. It fails to show rather than tell. Aside from Giamattis wounded protagonist it fails to form realistic or sympathetic characters -- characters vivid enough and grounded enough to beckon the audience anywhere. It fails to persuade. All this proves fatal for Lady a fable that returns Shyamalan to the overt spiritual journeying of Wide Awake. Giamatti plays Cleveland Heep the sad stuttering superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers a water nymph named Story in the pool. Cleveland learns that Story played by Bryce Dallas Howard (Shyamalans TheVillage) in pallid makeup and spooky bangs is a ""Narf"" from the ""Blue World"" who needs to contact her ""Vessel"" (the human half of a nymph-human buddy system) before she can escape the grassy hyenalike ""Scrunt"" and return home with the great eagle ""Eatlon"" -- though why a water nymph would be ferried home by a giant bird is a mystery. Things go horribly wrong when the Scrunt (which looks like a snarling topiary) proves renegade ignoring the law imposed by wicked woodland monkey monsters known collectively as the ""Tartutic."" Cleveland rallies assorted oddball residents to help usher Story on her way Among them are an animal lover (Mary Beth Hurt) a puzzle fanatic (Jeffrey Wright) a young dreamer (Shyamalan) a lopsided bodybuilder (Freddy Rodriguez) and a jaundiced movie critic (Bob Balaban) whose presence offends me not one bit I swear. In the process Giamatti exhibits the lung capacity of a Polynesian pearl diver. All this was inspired by a just-published bedtime story Shyamalan wrote for his kids. Also just published is Michael Bambergers The Man Who Heard Voices which details the directors split from Disney over Lady in the Water. Apparently a few execs were unhappy with the script. Much as I hate to side with Colossus they were right The screenplay sags with peculiar people saying peculiar things in long peculiar exposition that never takes flight as narrative. Everyones too credulous. Theres no genuine human conflict. And the computerized beasties arent scary; nothing is. ""You have to believe that this all makes sense somehow"" assures Cleveland. How I wanted to agree. I applaud Giamatti the movies welcome humor its abundant spirituality and old-school attention to detail. But in the end Shyamalans stumbling Lady never gives us a reason to believe. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 - - Photo Warner Bros. Lady hints at message thats never delivered 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Lady in the Water Fantasy. Starring Paul Giamatti Bryce Dallas Howard Bob Balaban and M. Night Shyamalan. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Lady in the Water"" written directed and co-produced by M. Night Shyamalan has the strengths and weaknesses of a one-man show. The movie is full of creative and imaginative turns and Shyamalan finds audacious ways to tell his story. The most audacious thing Shyamalan does is that he mainly tells the story literally rather than shows it starting with an animated sequence that lays out the terms of the tale in the first minutes. That a movie so riddled with relentless plot explanation can work as well as this one does comes as a revelation. ""Audacious"" is the word when a filmmaker tries something unusual and succeeds. Failure gets another word ""misguided."" Its misguided for example that Shyamalan has given us a film without a second act something that any collaborator could have noticed and helped fix. ""Lady in the Water"" features a long opening and then just as weve settled in it starts heading toward the finish. Whats especially peculiar is that the movie barely delivers on the promises it makes in its introduction. In the animated fable that precedes the action were told all about a lovely Blue World the sea in which people live in harmony while people in our world the world of the land are constantly in conflict. We all used to be part of that Blue World you see but we forgot all the lessons of beauty and love etc. So occasionally a Blue World emissary will come at great risk to impart a message that will put us on the right course and change the world forever. Sounds good. Just dont hold your breath waiting to hear the message and dont count on seeing any scenes of the world changing. Instead Shyamalan chooses to present an ensemble piece about a small insular community of people being menaced by something beyond their understanding. Does that ring a bell? Counting ""Signs"" and ""The Village"" ""Lady in the Water"" is his third movie in a row that adopts that exact narrative strategy. Its a particular waste here because this time unlike the others Shyamalan has a bite into a real story. It should have expanded him creatively. Virtually any gifted screenwriter given the first third of Shyamalans script could have run with it to the ends of the earth. But Shyamalan retreated into the familiar folded in on himself and limited the action to a little apartment complex in Philadelphia. At this little apartment complex no one is allowed to swim in the pool past 7 p.m. and Paul Giamatti as Cleveland the sensitive stuttering building manager is in charge of enforcing the rules. Thats why hes the one to find the narf (Bryce Dallas Howard) the emissary from Blue World whos a little like Daryl Hannah in ""Splash"" except that shes terrified depressed and clairvoyant. And she isnt a mermaid. In other ways shes similar -- young female nude and with a habit of staring off vacantly. Shyamalans choice to begin the film with an explanation of the narf and her mission robs the beginning of interest but he has too much fable to impart to let things unfold naturally. As the film proceeds further narf knowledge is doled out to the audience on a need-to-know basis. Giamatti contributes a rumpled decency a core of humanity and emotion that Shyamalan needs and benefits from. Shyamalan himself appears in a major role as a writer whose book will someday transform humankind. I would have liked to see the transformation. Id have liked that a lot better than watching people in an apartment complex stand around a swimming pool fighting off green wolves. Oh yes. Green wolves. With his work beginning to seem as insular as the communities hes imagining Shyamalan really needs to try directing someone elses screenplay. But Shyamalan does inject some humor into ""Lady in the Water which is something new for him. His funniest gambit here is the film critic from hell as one of the tenants (Bob Balaban) a man who cant be pleased and who insists that theres no originality in Hollywood. Alas the barb is less funny in retrospect because Shyamalan didnt prove him wrong. Its probably best not to bring up the subject of originality in a movie thats a dead ringer for your past two efforts. -- Advisory Violence near nudity sexual innuendo.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post M. Night Shyamalan doesnt have an ego problem. Hes just a humble screenwriter and director who makes himself a star of his own movie - as a character who is a writer whose words will save the world from despair and destruction. A character who will die as a martyr but be remembered forever as the redeemer. Yes theres a serious God complex hanging around the apartment complex at the heart of Shyamalans latest movie ""Lady in the Water."" Shyamalan has sucked way too hard on the tailpipe of his own fearsome publicity machine where the fumes read like this ""A master storyteller can craft a single line of dialogue that resonates with audiences for a lifetime."" Whew. If only it were true in this case. ""Lady in the Water"" boasts dialogue like this ""A Scrunt will do anything to kill a Madame Narf even forget his fear of the Tartutic."" I guess ""resonates"" is one word for that kind of writing. Blinded by his own aura the moviemaker has crafted a bizarre fairy tale that is neither adult horror movie nor childish fantasy. The result is a lot of gibberish about a submarine world of angelic Narfs risen to Earth to save humankind delivered in expository dialogue about as enlightening as a conversation held under water. Night as certain friends are encouraged to call him made a chilling masterpiece with ""The Sixth Sense."" Yet nearly everything since has been so flawed and self-conscious (see ""The Village"") that his accomplishments seem like reduction by addition. If youre confused as to what to expect from ""Lady in the Water"" blame those same sycophantic marketers. The trailer makes it a jump- from-the-shower-curtain horror show. Interviews with the dreamy self-referential Shyamalan meanwhile speak of hopeful morality tales for his children. ""Lady in the Water"" tries to be both plus a satire about Hollywood genre movies plus a character study of Paul Giamattis troubled handyman Cleveland Heep plus an ethnic comedy. Just when it might be clicking in one of those gears Shyamalan shifts to another. Cleveland is the manager at a woodsy apartment complex in the Philadelphia suburbs. His tenants are an eclectic mix later meant to represent archetypes but in the meantime depicting tired cliche The superstitious Asian grandmother the talky Jewish woman the stoner poets the Nature Lady. But Cleveland is most worried about the squatter in his pool Bryce Dallas Howard plays a water nymph with long legs and skin thats seen far too much of Tide with Bleach Alternative. She moons around Clevelands apartment claiming he needs to save the world but never quite telling how. (The messiah-as-water-nymphs name is ""Story."" Get it?) The plot circles longer than a United jet in an OHare thunderstorm. Every one of those kooky tenants has a role in the myth (Memo to self Dont bet the universe on the stoner poets) while silly beasts roam the nearby bushes (Memo to Shyamalan Dont bet your scariest moments on a pile of mangy grass clippings). Even the always welcome Giamatti eventually isnt so welcome. His habitual line reading of swallowing hard in mid-sentence to represent humility accentuated here by his characters stutter quickly moves from endearing to irritating. His chaste reverence for Story - see that metaphor is all-purpose - is chivalrous but ultimately ridiculous. Wouldnt a widower at least want to know if a love-struck Narf can kiss? I still cant get past the worlds greatest water nymph appearing in Philly. Wouldnt she choose a more scenic aqua- culture like maybe Aruba? The clincher is when Giamatti dives into the pool drain to find the nymphs lair. I dont know what lurks in the Philadelphia sewer system but Im pretty sure it aint Atlantis.

Lady in the Water Movie Review (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lady-in-the-water-2006,200,ladyinthewater9,ladyinthewater,rogerebert
"Lady in the Water is a fractured fairy tale - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Fractured fairy tale Lady in the Water reflects M. Night Shyamalans deep gifts as a filmmaker. But its also drenched in self-regard. By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 21 2006 A few years ago the quick trick ending of M. Night Shyamalans superhero opus ``Unbreakable"" left me in a state of wild exasperation. (``That was a beginning"") Then a good friend offered this consolation The movie he said was like watching someone meticulously snip through a stack of paper. Two hours later the cutter puts down his scissors and reveals his deceptively ornate creation a snowflake. My friend had perfectly captured the sense of craftsmanship that can be so captivating so wondrous and so infuriating about an M. Night film. On the other hand a different friend says the director just puts the ``sham"" in Shyamalan.In any case ``Lady in the Water"" is the directors latest and most complicated paper snowflake -- or sham if youre so inclined. The movie gives us Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) a dolorous stuttering widower who manages a large courtyard apartment complex somewhere in or near Philadelphia. (The city has never seemed more like Santa Monica but never mind.)Cleveland makes his way around the property. He pops in on the multiethnic collection of residents that make the place a virtual international house and gives a tour to his newest tenant a book and film critic named Farber (like the great critic Manny Farber) whom Bob Balaban plays with humorous humorlessness. One night Cleveland tumbles into the courtyards swimming pool and is rescued by the strange young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) who lives in the waters beneath it. She has perfect skin even better diction but terrible bangs. Her name is Story and as the namesake implies she arrives with a tale. But the rules of her world prohibit her from telling it.Cleveland deduces that his guest is a character in a bedtime story known only by the Korean lady (June Kyoto Lu) who lives with her Americanized daughter (Cindy Cheung) in one of the units. (Shyamalan actually based the film on a tale he invented for his little girls.) Apparently Story is a ``narf"" some kind of lost sea nymph. And its crucial she get back to her watery home before the killer wolf thing lurking in the woods around the building comes and gets her.Like Shyamalans four previous movies -- ``The Sixth Sense"" ``Unbreakable"" ``Signs"" and especially ``The Village"" this new film is a trip to ``The Twilight Zone."" (Giamattis romantic sadness and simmering temper make him the ideal man for any of the original episodes.) The directors ambition to build suspense through withholding and irony has won him Hitchcock comparisons. His ability to entertain with cinematically robust storytelling is comparable to Spielbergs. And `` Lady in the Water"" is sometimes a pleasing amalgam of the adventures in point-of-view from ``Rear Window"" and the fantastical homecoming of ``E.T."" Shyamalans movie is also a cockier and more precious thing. Its a fable about fables -- or more precisely about how nobody makes good fables anymore. Yet despite how delightful it is watching Giamatti try to bring together the strands of story Shyamalans fairy tale doesnt hold up to scrutiny -- at least after a first viewing. (A new book about Shyamalans making of the movie ``The Man Who Heard Voices"" only helps a little.)The films narrative as it turns out is beside the point of Shyamalans other thematic pursuits one of which happens to be himself. Sure the superb cast also includes Jeffrey Wright Jared Harris Mary Beth Hurt Freddy Rodriguez Bill Irwin and the lovely Sarita Choudhury but Shyamalan plays the films heaviest supporting role a writer whos composed a book that according to Story will change the world. She pays him further superlative compliments and tells him of his important destiny. The impulse is to roll your eyes while the filmmaker pats himself on the back.Nothing Shyamalan has made aspires to world-changing greatness -- or at least none of it is world-changing great. But in each of his movies Shyamalan is trying to wed the horrors of the outside world with those in his insular hermitically sealed universe. It can be a pretentious and exasperating marriage since Shyamalan ends his movies the moment reality threatens to invade them. The most amazing example is the sociological prank and suburban-paranoia metaphor that ``The Village"" turned out to be.`` Lady in the Water"" doesnt conclude with a trap-door ending but current events are vaguely all around. For instance there is war on the television set and at one crucial point toward the end the character who spends most of the movie watching it barks at the make-believe absurdity Cleveland has roped him and the other tenants into. Hes offended. Understandably so. On some level what Shyamalan is asking us to do -- to forget the wall-to-wall chaos of our times -- is offensive. Most movies require surrender but Shyamalan wants us to see `` Lady in the Water"" as a sanctuary. It doesnt have that kind of power. Its built on too much ponderous self-regard. And Im saying this as someone who was tickled by the films harsh treatment of the starchy movie critic.Nonetheless it is possible to wrestle yourself from the movies hokey ambitions. There is a good chunk of `` Lady in the Water"" that is simply too well made and affectingly acted to dismiss as a mere exercise in arrogance. Youre tempted to believe in Shyamalans belief in storytelling even if you dont believe in Shyamalan himself.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Night Shyamalans ""Lady In the Water"" was inspired we are told by a bedtime story the filmmaker told his kids. Im here to tell you that this cloying piece of claptrap sets a high-water mark for pomposity condescension false profundity and true turgidity -- no small accomplishment for the man whose last two features were the deadly duo ""Signs"" and ""The Village."" Mr. Shyamalans new film in which a saintly water nymph named Story surfaces in an apartment buildings swimming pool is being sold as another of his tales of the supernatural. His first success in the genre was the genuinely creepy ""The Sixth Sense"" with its signature line ""I see dead people."" But that was seven years ago. Now everyone is dead in ""Lady In the Water"" and they arent meant to be. Theyve simply been suffocated by super-seriousness in the telling of a small murky fable. ENLARGE Murky like the water in the pool or like Christopher Doyles cinematography. If I understand correctly Story is a character from an ancient bedtime tale -- in the movies terminology a Narf. She has ventured from her home the Blue World for the sake of humankind but she needs human help to return since her passage is blocked by Scrunts -- snarky growlers from the world of not-so-special effects suggesting hyenas with Formica-chip coats. Story who speaks without contractions is played by Bryce Dallas Howard with the sentimental diaphanous quality that was once associated with Laura in ""The Glass Menagerie."" She is always on the verge of tears or in tears thanks to her fears for humanity or for herself or to the chlorine in the pool. Paul Giamatti is Cleveland Heep the apartment superintendent who discovers her and who by protecting the fragile Narf finds his own higher purpose. The filmmakers purpose is to make Cleveland a surrogate for suffering humanity by giving him an off-putting stutter and a tragic past. ""Your words are very beautiful. Your heart is very big"" Story tells him after peeking in his private journal. But the words that Mr. Shyamalan puts in Clevelands mouth are very pretentious in their very mock-simplicity and ones heart goes out to the superb actor charged with speaking them. ""Lady In the Water"" is studded with cartoonish performances in other roles Mr. Shyamalans notions of comedy and horror have grown equally grotesque. And the narrative is littered with tedious complications -- rules to be followed in the course of the quasi-religious rite that will save Storys life and redeem those who save her. For bad measure the filmmaker has thrown in a dyspeptic movie critic played by Bob Balaban who doesnt have a clue about movies not to mention real life. ""Im seeing a romance film tonight"" he announces prissily ""but its not my cup of tea."" This guy would love Scrunts and Narfs. Monster House ENLARGE Three children try to unlock the secrets of the Monster House. ""Honey Im home"" says Mr. Nebbercracker the neighborhood ogre in ""Monster House."" Hes talking to his house which far from being a honey has a habit of ingesting anyone who comes too close. This PG-rated Halloween-in-July extravaganza a debut feature directed by Gil Kenan with Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg as executive producers is enjoyable enough for kids though its haunted-house effects are too intense for very young ones. ""Monster House"" was shot with the same motion-capture process that was used in Mr. Zemeckiss ""Polar Express"" a process I didnt like then and dont like now even though advancements have been made in its area of obvious weakness immobile faces. ""Monster House"" benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting but the script is nothing to write home about. It focuses on three neighborhood kids reminiscent of the trio in ""Harry Potter"" who dare to penetrate the house in an effort to tame it. By the time theyve survived a succession of standard-brand terrors done with visual flair they understand what every homeowner already knows -- a house can eat you alive. Heading South The title of ""Heading South"" may be a double entendre a reference to geography and human anatomy but Laurent Cantets fascinating troubling drama has many meanings. Its set in the late 1970s in Haiti a tourist paradise for three white middle-aged women from North America -- one is Canadian -- who are taking pleasure to varying degrees from young and handsome Legba (Menothy Cesar) a black male prostitute. At first the film puts us in the intentionally discomfiting position of voyeurs watching two of the women vie for Legbas affections -- Mr. Cantet is too tactful to dwell on the physical details -- and listening to them as they speak directly to the camera of their sexual yearnings. Charlotte Rampling is alternately touching and frightening as Ellen a professor of French at Wellesley. Brenda a troubled divorcee from Georgia is played by Karen Young whose mercurial performance made me think of Geraldine Page in Tennessee Williams dramas that in fact share a certain amount of territory with this one. Sex-obsessed though its women may be ""Heading South"" sees them and their obliging lover in the larger context of sexual politics and colonial relationships. ""Legba belongs to everyone"" Ellen tells Brenda. ""He makes the decisions."" Thats not true though. As a citizen of impoverished Haiti Legba is at the mercy of a brutal regime. As a gigolo at a beach resort hes at the mercy of the wealthy women he seduces and taunts. Legba belongs to everyone but himself. Overlord The American writer-director Stuart Cooper made ""Overlord"" in 1975 but only now has his remarkable film set in England during World War II been given an American release. (Operation Overlord was the Allied invasion of France.) Even before the action starts the film announces its singularity with the very first title ""The Imperial War Museum Presents."" The museums vast archives centered in London were the source of military and newsreel footage around which the dramatic content was written and shot. (And shot superbly in evocative black and white by the late John Alcott Stanley Kubricks favorite cinematographer whose specialty was making powerful images with the simplest possible lighting setups.) The story has its own simplicity and power. ""Overlord"" follows an English recruit Tom (Brian Stirner) from basic training to a Normandy beach on D-Day. Hardly more than a boy Tom finds time for a fleeting dalliance with a tender young woman but he goes into battle with an abiding sense of doom. ""This war has killed so many already"" he tells a mate. ""Im just going to be another one."" Using the Imperial Museums footage Stuart Cooper sets Toms fate against the gargantuan machinery of war. ""Overlord"" feels like a small but vivid tragedy inside an epic container. In Brief ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend"" stars Uma Thurman as Jenny Johnson a k a G-Girl a neurotically needy superhero. The movie was directed with all the finesse of a junior high school pageant by Ivan Reitman. (Yes the same Ivan Reitman who directed ""Ghost Busters."") Luke Wilson is steadfastly bland in the role of Matt Saunders a regular guy who cant deal with Jennys insecurities Theres a funny idea here but you might not know it from Don Paynes script or for that matter from Ms. Thurmans performance which serves as an unintended tribute to Quentin Tarantino who used her so effectively in the two volumes of ""Kill Bill."" ""Youre young"" a doctor tells the hero of ""Time To Leave"" a fashion photographer named Romain (Melvil Poupaud) who has just been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. ""Id prefer that you fight."" But Francois Ozons French-language tone poem for lack of a better term to describe the straight-line drama isnt about fighting. Its about a gay man coming to terms with his mortality and in a plot twist thats as contrived as it is ironic with the biblical injunction to procreate. As the heros beloved grandmother Jeanne Moreau has a few lively scenes in a somber film that needs them.    DVD TIP A year before his spectacular comic performance in ""Sideways"" Paul Giamatti was less spectacular but brilliantly comical in ""American Splendor"" (2003) as Harvey Pekar an American original who turned his ostensibly ordinary life into comic-book narratives of extraordinary depth and feeling. Hope Davis is Harveys wife Joyce. The film was written and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini and photographed by Terry Stacey.

Night ShyamalanDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for some frightening sequencesRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens today nationwide LADY IN THE WATERPhotos A look at M. Night Shyamalans workMuch riding on Shyamalans Lady luckReview Lady in the Water is a little lukewarm Shyamalans Lady in the Water is a little on the lukewarm side Updated 7/20/2006 843 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Mike Clark USA TODAY As the title hints M. Night Shyamalans newsmaking Lady in the Water is set around a swimming pool. And though the result is too idiosyncratic to be regarded as just one more summer-movie whiff those who see it may feel a need to act like a pool lifeguard and blow the whistle on Shyamalan. In other words someone needs to tell the beleaguered writer/director that its looking like ""break time."" But come to think of it Disney the studio that nurtured Shyamalans first four movies kind of did forging a breach that landed this movie at Warner Bros. Whats on the screen is an original to be sure if clearly a cousin to better Shyamalan movies such as The Sixth Sense and Signs. The character played by lead Paul Giamatti is a dead-on Shyamalan protagonist emotionally distanced and something of a train wreck. Giamatti spends a lot of time around Waters humble apartment complex pool -- not as a sunbather but as the superintendent who cleans it. And now someone mysterious has been swimming at night and getting hair in the filter. Turns out shes an otherworldly sea nymph or ""Narf."" This redhead Narf named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes with some baggage. A furry angry ""scrunt"" creature who also comes from her yearned-for home base ""Blue World"" threatens her by prowling the complex at night. Can you believe this all takes place in Philadelphia? Viewers can accept this premise (though you can hear a chorus chanting ""They can?"") and still note at least two big problems here. One is Howard -- who was better in The Village an overall worse Shyamalan movie. She is ethereal in Water but not in a remotely interestingly way. The other trouble is the smorgasbord of apartment eccentrics (Shyamalan included) employed to aid her. Theyre sometimes funny -- intentional humor does abound here -- but they clash with then kill any mystic intentions. If anything Owen Wilson is far more mystic in You Me and Dupree. I suppose one cant complain that todays Hollywood is too homogenized and then get mega-snotty when someone hands us a mold-breaker. The New York Times A.O. Scott wrote a great article last year about how todays micromanaged film production philosophies no longer allow for high-profile howlers (or follies or whatever you want to call them) of yore. Guess what gang? ""Yore"" is back. Posted 7/20/2006 930 PM ET Updated 7/20/2006 843 PM ET E-mail | Print | Enlarge Warner Bros. Apartment complex manager Paul Giamatti dips his toes into a mystery.

"Lady in the Water reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Lady in the Water reviewed. Lady in the Water reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 20 2006 549 PM The Deep End A mermaid a pool and one seriously nutty director Lady in the Water. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens and Bryan Curtis Spoiler Special about  Lady in the Water by clicking the arrow on the player below Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard in Lady in the Water Lady in the Water (Warner Bros.) marks M. Night Shyamalans official leap off the deep end. Not everyone agrees on Shyamalans talent as a filmmaker but few up till now have questioned his sanity. Two earlier films The Sixth Sense and The Village were cleverly constructed airtight allegorical worlds that turned neatly inside out at the end to become different worlds while Signs was a somber exploration of what might happen if one well-known brand of occult craziness--the kind involving aliens crop circles and tinfoil hats--turned out to be in fact justified. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Lady in the Water dispenses with allegory altogether. It invents its own occult craziness out of whole cloth justification be damned and puts it right out there. Shyamalan is no longer asking anyones permission to be weird and theres something exhilarating in that. The bad news is that he may have traveled so deep into his own brain that only his nearest and dearest (this movie was based on a bedtime story the director made up for his daughters) care to follow where hes going anymore. Advertisement Paul Giamatti plays Cleveland Heep (one of the great character names in recent memory) a building superintendent at a Philadelphia apartment complex called the Cove. Heep is glum and awkward with a serious stutter but he takes his job seriously and runs his building with pride. When someone starts swimming in the pool after hours and leaving gobs of red hair tangled in the filter Heep takes the infraction as a personal insult and vows to discover the offender. The night swimmer turns out to be not a tenant but a mysterious pre-Raphaelite beauty named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard). After a night spent chastely sleeping in Heeps arms she tells him of her mission Shes been sent from the ""blue world"" beneath the sea to serve as a kind of muse to someone a writer living at the Cove. Its Heeps job to locate that person hook the two of them up for their metaphysical coffee date and guide Story back to her underwater kingdom. Heep whose misanthropic manner suggests at least something of the skeptic never for a moment doubts Storys story. Might the naked chick in the pool be a drug addict? A mental patient? A grifter? No shes just a narf a kind of mermaid with legs who eschews contractions (""I cannot tell you who I have been sent to find"") as she spins her otherworldly tale. Like any reasonable narf Story lives in fear of the scrunt a snarling red-eyed beast made of plant material. Scrunts harbor an irrational grudge against narfs (or maybe just find them tasty) and theres a particularly disgruntled scrunt lurking just outside Heeps cottage apartment waiting to tear Story limb from lovely limb if she ventures outside. I dont hold it against Shyamalan that his plot is completely preposterous that his characters (except for Heep) are cardboard constructions in service of the story or even that his ending traffics in glutinous New-Age cliches about owning your demons and embracing your inner child. I will hold against him that Lady in the Water isnt scary that its own inner logic breaks down at countless points along the way and that its ending is disappointingly literal and just plain stupid. Lady in the Water is however funny at times even intentionally so. Paul Giamatti is perfect as the nebbishy super; he invests the smallest moment with convincing bits of comic business (as when waiting alone for another character he engages in nervous finger-snapping). Hes even game for an underwater action sequence in which the hair on his chubby back swaying like seaweed in the waves he locates the narfs underwater lair. Giamatti is every bit as craftsmanlike about playing Cleveland Heep as Heep is about running the Cove. Shyamalan himself plays Vick Ran a tenant who may be the writer Story seeks and hes assembled a genial cast of supporting players. Bob Balaban appears as a stuffy self-important film critic who gets his comeuppance in a scene that is the directors blatant flip-off to the critical establishment. The clown Bill Irwin does a spooky turn as a reclusive tenant who spends his days watching television coverage of an unnamed war and Bryce Dallas Howard pulls off a serviceable narf--a role that to be fair consists mainly of looking good wet. Its too bad Shyamalan appears to have completely lost his marbles. Hes a canny elegant director (if at times a clumsy symbol-heavy screenwriter) and even at their worst his films have a surety of touch--they may be hokey but theyre defiantly themselves. The closed universe of the Cove complex (the camera never ventures outside the buildings walls) could have been a great setting for a Rear Window-like investigation of neighborliness gone awry. Instead Lady in the Water is more like a desexualized remake of Splash A pretty mermaid holes up in a nice guys apartment until he finally learns how to set her free. Just add an extra layer of mythical self-importance and one very angry scrunt. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Night Shyamalans ""Lady in the Water"" should be called ""Dead in the Water."" The idea for this ingrown idyll grew out of bedtime stories Shyamalan concocted for his daughters. One wonders if the girls had the nerve to tell Daddy he should avoid at all costs turning these tales into a movie.Apparently not many people have the nerve to tell Shyamalan much of anything - anything negative that is - and still remain a collaborator. When the Disney executives wavered at the prospect of making ""Lady in the Water"" citing chasmic script problems Shyamalan decamped to rival Warner Bros. whose publicists should really be commended for handling this film with a straight face.There are few hard and fast rules in the movie business but one of them is Characters who speak without using contractions are annoying. Cleveland Heep a woebegone apartment manager in Philadelphia played by Paul Giamatti is pretty good at using contractions. But then he rescues a mermaid whose name helpfully is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the complexs swimming pool and gets a lesson in nymphspeak. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Example ""I am from the Blue World."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 It turns out that Story is a ""narf"" a fairy tale creature who is being pursued by another Blue World renegade the Scrunt a werewolf-like horror with perhaps the fakest-looking body parts this side of an Ed Wood movie. But at least Scrunt is an evocative moniker much better than narf which is too close to ""nerf"" to be taken seriously.Story needless to say is on a ""quest."" A quest in the movies is invariably a day trip that has turned mythic. In the case of ""Lady in the Water"" the mythos is all in Shyamalans mind. His carrying card as a writer-director has always been his supposed fearlessness - his ability to venture forth into the mystical underbrush where smaller souls dare not tread.But with the exception of the ingeniously dolorous ""The Sixth Sense"" Shyamalans ego has always outstripped his achievement. Not content simply to be a new-style Hitchcock or a junior-league Spielberg he wants to be deified as a truth-teller a spiritual guide with the untrammeled soul of a child. His hot-air religiosity reached its lowest high point in ""Signs"" but its been a constant throughout his oeuvre and never more so than in ""Lady in the Water"" where Storys presence draws together the apartment complexs denizens into a common destiny. She becomes the agent for their transcendence. All of which would be fine if Shyamalan possessed an ounce of transcendent feeling. But in addition to his tin ear for dialogue he has a blinkered eye for the angelic. Story for instance looks positively pallid - not since Helena Bonham Carter has there been an actress so chalkwhite. Its difficult to imagine this ""narf ""nymph inspiring anybody to do anything except dial 911.Shyamalan has the clout to assemble a marvelous cast and the ineptitude to waste them. Giamatti looks miserable which no doubt will endear him to the audience for this horrid film. Still its great to see him as a leading man. Who says that only actors with strong chins can get the girl?But Cleveland who is saddled with a stutter and a weepy personal back story is a poor excuse for a character - hes like the point man in a scavenger hunt - and the same is true for the characters played by Bill Irwin (bookish shut-in) Jeffrey Wright (crossword maven) Cindy Cheung (Korean-American marathon talker) and Shyamalan who in a gesture of extreme humility casts himself as a would-be writer whose philosophical tome it is prophesied by Story will change the world and resonate throughout time.My favorite apartment dweller though is the film critic played by Bob Balaban a man with a complexion to rival Storys. Like a vampire he spends his days in the dark plying his foul trade. This dour twit explains to Cleveland that ""there is no originality left in the world and no new stories"" and of course his presence is intended as a preemptive strike against all those critics who will make fun of this movie. If you dont like ""Lady in the Water"" it must be because you cant spot originality when its staring you in the face. Right?Shyamalan is a classic example of a fairly talented Hollywood auteur who has let his megasuccess go to his head. It is not enough for such filmmakers to make billions; they must also cast themselves as gurus. Emotionally and intellectually ""Lady in the Water"" is so far removed from its audience that I cant imagine it being a hit - although these days who knows? But I suspect audiences will see Shyamalans portentous doodle for what it is - the height of arrogance and a bad night out at the movies.

"Lady in the Water Ingenious Strokes of Fantasy washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Lady in the Water Ingenious Strokes of Fantasy Bryce Dallas Howard as an exotic creature in M. Night Shyamalans flick. (By Frank Masi) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 21 2006 ""Lady in the Water"" doesnt have a cute kid who sees dead people but it has something intriguingly better a pallid otherworldly watery being called Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who sets the stage for a mesmerizing bedside yarn with all-but-apocalyptic dimension. Filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan may never match the commercial success of ""The Sixth Sense"" which held audiences in its thrall to the tune of almost 300 million. But ""Lady in the Water"" a captivating amalgam of mystery thriller and mythic fantasy eclipses his 1999 debut for sheer inventiveness audacity and narrative derring-do. When Story emerges from a swimming pool behind a dingy Philadelphia apartment building and into the arms of its bewildered superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) he learns she needs protection. But from what? Slowly the houseguest reveals that shes a ""narf"" a nymph who has been sent by her people to find a man of deep significance. She knows only that he is a writer whose words will affect the course of humanity. But she dares not leave Clevelands apartment because of marauding creatures in the wooded area just beyond the run-down high-rise. Cleveland seeks help from his Korean neighbor Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) and her mother Mrs. Choi (June Kyoto Lu) a cantankerous old lady who knows -- from stories she heard as a child -- all about narfs marauding ""scrunts"" and terrifying monkeylike beings known as ""tartutics"" that lurk in trees. The plot follows the filmmakers familiar strategy in which seemingly insignificant episodes and characters accumulate like bricks to become a grand structure. As Shyamalan aficionados have come to appreciate that building is inlaid everywhere with narrative twists. And Cleveland a guy who has resigned himself to a life plunging toilets soon understands that hes at the beginning of something significant. A mission. He accepts the challenge. Its easy to see why Disney Shyamalans backer for his previous four movies withdrew from the project after reading the script. ""Lady in the Water"" now a Warner Bros. film is more complex -- and just plain weird -- than anything he has attempted before. It is peopled with disconcerting characters including the stammering antihero a room full of potheads and the almost funereal Mr. Farber (Bob Balaban) a humorless book and film critic who despises most movies (you can imagine his reviews of Disney flicks) and serves as the movies postmodern comic relief. And Shyamalan who has made a tradition of brief cameos in his films gives himself a surprisingly hefty role as another resident of Clevelands building. But Disneys withdrawal is a gain for viewers who value fanciful storytelling thats not afraid to follow its most eccentric impulses. Shyamalan has never shied from high-wire risk and the very unevenness of his work ranging from the sublime ""Sixth Sense"" to the disastrous ""The Village"" is testament to that courageous sensibility. Should commercial consideration always be the sine qua non the lodestar of American filmmaking? Hopefully not. If the ultimate goal is entertainment then ""Lady in the Water"" enthusiastically rises to the task. In a movie laden with enough symbolism shamanism and mythic lore to make Joseph Campbell dance a tribal jig Shyamalan never forgets to have fun. Interspersed throughout the film is a deft humor that not only offers further insight into its characters but also allows the audience to take a breath before negotiating the next story corridor. At one point Cleveland is waiting patiently for translation as Mrs. Choi is unleashing a flurry of strident banter upon her daughter. After giving Cleveland the information hes so desperate for a flustered Young-Soon adds that her mother ""also told me I should be married to a dentist."" At the center of all this is Giamatti whose performance demands short-list consideration come award time. He seems to grow with every role and here you particularly notice the very expressiveness of his eyes variously furtive shy mysterious observant even brooding -- and always haunted. Until now Shyamalans work has been one of masterful trickery designed to keep audiences spellbound until the end credits. But for the first time the filmmaker illuminates a world beyond scheme beyond the shell games of his earlier films. In ""Lady in the Water"" we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves. The eventual outcome of their lives is something we contemplate long after the movie has ended. Thats the mark of an artist who makes it his business to push the boundaries of storytelling in Hollywood. And thats exciting. Lady in the Water (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some frightening sequences.

"Lady in the Water The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lady-in-the-water-the ) Lady in the Water The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli When you consider a modern day fairy tale no matter how twisted ideal descriptions include ""enchanting"" ""engaging"" and ""magical."" They do not include ""silly"" ""ridiculous"" and ""laughable."" Unfortunately in the case of Lady in the Water the latter group of adjectives is the one that applies. This is the biggest misfire of M. Night Shyamalans career including his pre-Sixth Sense movies. In addition to being dull and uninvolving the film fails to draw in the viewer sufficiently to facilitate suspension of disbelief which allows the plot to resemble a rejected Ed Wood screenplay. For those who though Shyamalan was stretching and not playing fair in The Village you aint seen nothing yet. Lady in the Water starts out like an average mermaid movie with apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) discovering a female creature splashing around in the complexs swimming pool. (This is unlike any pool Im familiar with. A drain in the well leads not to pipes but to a complex underwater cave system. But I digressa|) Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) is her name and shes not actually a mermaid (no tail) but a naiad. Warning silly nomenclature follows. Story is from The Blue World and is a member of a race called narfs (rhymes with barfs). She has come to human lands to provide enlightenment to one man after which she must return home. During her stay she is pursued by the Scrunt a wolf like creature that camouflages itself as the lawn. (Good thing it isnt mowing day.) The Scrunt wants to attack Story and inject her with its poisonous Kii although why it doesnt gobble her down whole or rend her to pieces is a mystery. Then theres the Tartutic - a trio of monkeys having bad hair days - that represents the only power capable of stopping the Scrunt. On one level I suppose one could consider this to be a love story between sadsack Cleveland (whose backstory tells us his wife and children were victims of a multiple murderer) and anemic Story. It doesnt matter that theres no discernable chemistry between them because conventional romance is not on Shymalans agenda. He just wants to get an Oscar nominated actor to say words like ""narf"" ""scrunt"" and ""tartutic."" The film solves the problem of PG-13 nudity by showing only Storys feet when shes naked. Theres more skin in this years other aquawoman feature Aquamarine. (It pains me to admit that the earlier tween-centric movie offers better entertainment value.) The movie deviates in a big way from previous Shyamalan scripts in that it offers no twists unless you count several minor misdirections. Another change is that for this outing Shyamalan gives himself a significant on-screen presence rather than just a walk-on cameo. His performance is a little wooden but that didnt bother him in Praying with Anger and it doesnt bother him here. He has surrounded himself with an interesting supporting cast but no one gets enough screen time to make an impression. For the most part the dialogue is embarrassing. Its also difficult to determine how much of the films humor is intentional and how much is unplanned. Maybe all the bad lines and funny words are supposed to be funny (in a campy way). Certainly the Asian grandmothers ""story"" as told through her interpreter daughter (Cindy Cheung) isnt supposed to be taken seriously. Then there are a couple of brilliant Scream-inspired sequences with Bob Balaban playing a film critic. These are obviously comedic and they provoke the intended reaction. For the most part however Lady in the Water comes across as a movie thats too bad to be good and not bad enough to be so bad that its good. Theres probably a cult following thats going to love the film and laud its spiritual overtones and none-too-subtle redemption motif. To me however it felt silly and artificial. When a filmmaker tells a story that transports the audience into an alternate reality his first objective must be to get the viewers to believe in this world. Shyamalan doesnt do that. He assumes well accept it and that mistake sinks the movie. Not having bought into the story we spend nearly two hours making fun of the grass-backed wolf the shocked monkeys and a bunch of other missteps. This is sloppy filmmaking and its likely to wipe away whatever luster still remains to Shyamalans reputation following his unexpected (and in my view undeserved) success with The Sixth Sense.

Night Shyamalans latest effort ""Lady in the Water."" Disneys misgivings were well founded as Shyamalan has followed ""The Village"" with another disappointment -- a ponderous self-indulgent bedtime tale. Vindication is rarely as swift or complete as that likely awaiting the Disney execs who passed on M. Night Shyamalans latest effort ""Lady in the Water."" After Disney balked the director carted the project to Burbank neighbor Warner Bros. then lambasted his former studio for a lack of vision in a tie-in tell-some book. Disneys misgivings were well founded as Shyamalan has followed ""The Village"" with another disappointment -- a ponderous self-indulgent bedtime tale. Awkwardly positioned this gloomy gothic fantasy falls well short of horror leaving grim theatrical prospects beyond whatever curiosity the filmmakers reputation and the mini-controversy can scare up. Although Shyamalan indicates in the storybook-style animated opening sequence that the story is derived from ancient myth his perplexing creation stimulates a nagging sense that hes simply making it up as he goes along. (This is apparently the case as the production notes say the idea ""began as an impromptu bedtime story for his two young daughters."") Among their complaints Disney execs reportedly warned Shyamalan about presenting a clueless film critic as a supporting player though compared with the pics other transgressions that one is harmless. The character appears designed to exact a measure of revenge against those who slighted ""The Village"" and to inoculate ""Lady in the Water"" against whatever barbs are hurled its way. That rather gratuitous plot point however coupled with the writer-director-producers expansion of his traditional Hitchcockian cameos into a pivotal role does flavor the film with a distracting hint of self-absorption. If Shyamalans earlier works hinged on a clever twist or big surprise (think ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" and less successfully ""The Village"") ""Lady"" telegraphs its intentions from the outset. The lady in question Story (""Village"" star Bryce Dallas Howard) is a ""Narf"" -- a sea nymph from The Blue World who has taken up residence in the swimming pool of the Cove apartments which no one will confuse with ""Melrose Place."" The complex is home to an eclectic group of misfits beginning with Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) its emotionally wounded superintendent who discovers Story and takes it upon himself to help the naked nymph fulfill her mission and return home a task that will require the aid of various tenants. Throughout shes in danger of attack by another Blue World visitor the Scrunt a werewolf-like creature that bears a passing resemblance to the ""beasts"" in ""The Village."" Story is alternately fearful and full of other-worldly serenity forcing Cleveland to elicit clues regarding the myth and how best to assist her from Young-Soon (Cindy Cheung) whose Korean-speaking mother is well versed in Narf lore. Others helping decipher the scheme include the aforementioned critic (Bob Balaban); a would-be writer (Shyamalan) and his sister (Sarita Choudhury); and a wordsmith (Jeffrey Wright) who excels at crossword puzzles. Shyamalans script is its own kind of puzzle albeit one that never connects and generally handcuffs the large cast. Giamatti is appropriately schlubby and dour as the Everyman thrust into the organizing role while Howard can never get much beyond a vacant beatific stare. Only Cheung brings much vitality to the proceedings and thats by jabbering away in fast-talking Pidgin English thats mostly silly but to some might border on offensive. Nor does it help that Balabans arrogant critic keeps discussing movie conventions and cliches in a film that builds toward an unsatisfying and abrupt climax. Reminding the audience where movies fall flat hardly seems advisable. Tech credits similarly fail to impress including the fleetingly glimpsed creature effects which given the marginal level of suspense hardly seem to justify a PG-13 rating. Whats most acutely lacking though is magic equal to the movies fairy-tale underpinnings -- starting with the enticing childlike notion of something mysterious living in the swimming pool. Establishing a sense of fantasy beyond James Newton Howards hard-working score might help people accept that a sort-of mermaid has moved in next door. Instead much of the action is confined to Story taking refuge in Clevelands depressing flat and the narrative proves a bit too intense for younger tykes yet neither exciting nor engaging enough to galvanize adults. By publicly harpooning Disney Shyamalan has rendered a kind of service -- illustrating how filmmakers can lose perspective on passion projects. Whatever the rationale behind the criticism however after using ""Lady in the Water"" to tuck in the kids it should have been tucked away.
