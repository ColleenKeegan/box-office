Starring Stephen Lang Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall. Directed by Ronald F. Maxwell. (PG-13. 229 minutes including intermission. At Bay Area theaters.) If ""Gods and Generals"" does nothing else it makes one thing clear It was a long long war. The Civil War epic takes nearly four hours to cover roughly two years in the wars eastern corridor a length that only might seem reasonable if we remember that the superb 1993 film ""Gettysburg"" -- for which this film serves as a prequel -- was even longer. The earlier films length was justified by the pivotal nature of the event the evenhandedness of its storytelling and the intricacy with which it presented all aspects of the battle. ""Gettysburg"" felt compressed while ""Gods and Generals"" feels deliberately languorous. Its a plodding episodic film reverent and sanctimonious and its pro-Southern viewpoint -- a time-honored Hollywood tendency -- makes ""Gone With the Wind"" look like a Northern polemic. Perhaps in order for the country to heal it was necessary seven score years ago that everyone should adopt the pretense that the war was just a big misunderstanding in which everyone was equally right and wrong. If the South could forgive the destruction of its cities it stood to reason that at least Northerners could refrain from harping on the obvious that the South fought against something sacred (the Constitution) for the sake of something profane (slavery). But ""Gods and Generals"" tests traditional northern etiquette to the breaking point. If one were to watch the movie with no knowledge of history one could be left with the impression that in 1861 a maniac named Lincoln decided to arm federal troops and attack neighboring states because he felt like it. Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) turns down command of the Union army and leads the Confederacy in a decision the movie presents as the height of principle. And Thomas Jackson (Stephen Lang) the future Stonewall Jackson watches with blue- eyed equanimity as a mob of his cadets tears down the American flag. Jackson is the hero of ""Gods and Generals"" and despite some halfhearted digressions to the Northern lines to visit Col. Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) this is essentially a Jackson hagiography. Much is made of the Confederate generals religious devotion though the spectacle of a man fighting for a misguided cause with absolute faith that God is on his side may have limited appeal. The movie improves in its last hour as it concentrates on the battle of Chancellorsville but by then three long hours have gone by. Its one thing to make a movie that lasts four hours. Its another thing to actively strive for epic length and thats the case here. . This film contains battle violence. -- Mick LaSalle A FAMILY AFFAIR Lesbian romantic comedy. Starring Helen Lesnick  Michele Greene  and Erica Shaffer . Directed and written by Helen Lesnick. (101 minutes. At the Galaxy.) Until now it may not have occurred to you that what we needed was a witty lesbian romance. Once you see ""A Family Affair"" you realize what weve been missing. The best part of this niche film is the jokey start when writer/director/lead actress Helen Lesnick looks dead at the camera with those Bette Davis eyes and cracks wise. The scene both sets up the premise -- looking for Ms. Right -- and reassures us that we are attending a comedy not a lecture. Lesnick as Rachel Rosen warns us right off the bat that this is ""what is known as a lesbian-themed movie"" and suggests that she will give anyone uncomfortable with that idea a moment to pack up and leave the theater. After dutifully waiting a good 60 seconds she gives us a conspirators wink and says ""Im glad they left. They were creeping me out."" Lesnick plays a lesbian Woody Allen (right down to appropriating one of his best lines from ""Play It Again Sam""). Rachel is a transplanted New Yorker who can do nothing but grouse when she settles in the strange world of California. Her Annie Hall is Christine Peterson (Erica Shaffer) a wholesome guileless California blonde. The two meet cute explore romance and attempt to weather a comeback attempt by Rachels old flame Reggie (Michele Greene). One of the nice touches is that the usual source of central conflict for this sort of movie -- coming out as gay and the ramifications to others -- is dealt with in the first few minutes and then is of only passing interest the rest of the film. We are shown a flashback of Rachels mother Leah (Arlene Golonka) experiencing a meltdown when she learns Rachel is gay but she quickly becomes such a convert that she tells Rachels heterosexual brother that she intends to refer to him only as ""non-gay."" Thats all good. The only quibble is that once the setup has been established -- Rachel is clearly in love with Christine but what about the seductive evil ex-girlfriend? -- it takes a long time to get to the payoff. We know Reggie is going to make one last pitch for Rachel but it seems to take forever for her to arrive and start pitching. Alls well in a sweet finish that saves this as a good old-fashioned love story. The scene in which the bride tosses her bouquet and Rachels gay male friends outbattle the bridesmaids for it is a reminder that this is a film that never loses its sense of humor. - Some nudity and matter-of-fact gay relationships. -- C.W. Nevius ETOILES DANCERS OF THE PARIS OPERA BALLET  Documentary. Directed by Nils Tavernier. (Not rated. 100 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) . There are touching moments in "" Etoiles"" but for the most part this is a dull dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject. Directed by Nils Tavernier the son of the respected director Bertrand Tavernier the film offers glimpses at some very great dancers and dancemakers barely identifies them and seldom delves into what makes them do what they do Maurice Bejart nearly loses his temper at the vapidity of Taverniers questions and simply walks away; Jiri Kylian surprises by revealing he still hasnt learned to speak French; principal dancers are shown applying makeup or tending to their sore feet more than they are filmed actually dancing. The Paris Operas byzantine rankings and competitive yearly examinations get a lot of screen time but the sublime quality of what these details imply escapes this director. The mood is melancholy the clips of ballets are frustrating in their brevity major events like Elisabeth Platels retirement are shown almost in passing and the whole picture has a distinct agenda of deglamorizing the worlds oldest and possibly finest ballet company. Balletomanes will likely be irritated even if they will nevertheless treasure the few shots of Bejarts monumental ""Ninth Symphony"" or some of the rehearsal footage from ""La Sylphide"" and ""Swan Lake."" Everyone else may end up just bored. -- Octavio Roca Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 4 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 5 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 6 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 10 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F.

"This War Is Hell washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids This War Is Hell Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 21 2003 ""GODS and Generals"" is less a movie than a meticulously tediously accurate Civil War reenactment committed to celluloid. Thanks to its bloated almost four-hour length its tone of uncritical hagiography (Look there goes Stonewall Jacksons arm floating up to heaven) and its tendency to bury the few real actors in its cast in molasses-thick Southern accents and bushy beards that make them look like theyve glued stuffed animals to their faces a viewing of this epic is likely to leave all but the geekiest Civil War buffs feeling as itchy and as restless as if they themselves were wearing woolen underwear -- soggy unwashed vintage 1860s government-issue woolen underwear. Staggering out of the theater into the light of downtown Washington I felt like Id lived through the Civil War and I dont mean that in a good way. Covering the years 1861 to 1863 and portraying the battles of First Manassas Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville ""Gamp;G"" is the second in Ronald F. Maxwells projected Civil War trilogy and a prequel to the filmmakers popular ""Gettysburg"" a 1993 drama based on Michael Shaaras historical novel ""The Killer Angels."" Based on the novel by Jeff Shaara (Michaels son) the new film begins with dreary scene-setting exposition that focuses on Virginias secession from the Union although it fails to explain in any real way the economic political or social roots of that decision. ""Though ah love the Union ah love Vuh-ginia mo-ah"" intones Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall one of the few actors who manages to avoid embarrassing himself). Thats about all we get by way of explanation of why he must refuse the federal governments offer to lead its forces against the ""rebels."" Most of ""Gamp;G"" concerns Gen. Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson (Stephen Lang) though a hero whose untimely death it is implied may have caused the South to lose the war. While the movie explains the origin of his nickname (""There stands Jackson like a stone wall"" a battlefield observer is alleged to have said) it does little to make us feel anything about this man as a human being. To be sure the conflict itself has a certain built-in drama and we do see that Jackson loves his wife daughter and African American cook. Still the film as a story does nothing to make us care about him in any genuine way. ""Gods and Generals"" has the look and sound of historical verisimilitude down to the way the opposing forces march stiffly toward each others ranks shooting into the face of death. But it is best characterized by the insufferable mawkishness of a scene in which an anonymous ""Billy Yank"" and ""Johnny Reb"" share a cup of coffee and a pipe of ""baccy"" while facing off along the Rappahannock River. Like that treacly scene it is essentially a hollow exercise full of pat ironies about former friends turned enemies and brother fighting against brother. Yes great sacrifices were made on both sides of the struggle on behalf of deeply held beliefs about states rights and slavery. But for this wan epiphany I had to give up four hours of my life? GODS AND GENERALS (PG-13 220 minutes) -- Contains extensive but largely bloodless battlefield violence. Area theaters.

"Gods and Generals A Distant Battle washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Gods and Generals A Distant Battle Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 21 2003 You have to give ""Gods and Generals"" high marks for honesty for its title tells you exactly what youre going to get for 3 1/2 hours the Civil War from the point of view of generals -- and of God. Is that useful? Slightly. It re-creates in fulsome detail a certain aspect of battle what it looks like from afar. It makes us wonder in awe at the courage of men who fought on either side it makes us honor their commitment to something beyond the narrowness of their own lives -- that is to faith and cause -- that enabled them to stand stoically in formation while shot and shell minced the atmosphere and their fellow soldiers. But a better question is an older one and the real stuff of narrative What did it feel like? The movie has no idea. Its like looking through the wrong end of the binoculars. The spectacle is indeed stimulating as vast phalanxes of men maneuver across the faraway greensward. But one doesnt come away from it with any sense of what the victory cost in human terms or what its like to face a rank of men shooting at you or to jam a bayonet into somebodys guts or have one jammed into your guts. (See ""Zulu"" if youre curious about 19th-century war.) Theres also a philosophical issue The movie is clearly intended as something of a Confederate Honor Restoration Project in which the men of the South are cut loose from the weight of slaverys evil and portrayed as God-fearing patriotic noble and heroic. You may or may not buy this but at the very least it should be pointed out that the argument is dependent on the selection of events it chooses. Other events would make other arguments. Ask the citizens of Lawrence Kan. or the inmates of Andersonville Prison how noble the Confederacy was. This is the first part of what will ultimately be a triptych. (The first movie released was the middle part ""Gettysburg""; the last part is yet to come.) Derived from the fictionalized history of the Shaaras father Michael and son Jeff the movie repeats the formula of ""Gettysburg"" the assistance full-throated and over-enthusiastic of the reenactment community all 10000 of them; the appearance of second-tier Hollywood performers in the larger speaking roles and regional professionals in less pressing roles; the tone of irony-free earnestness not found in an American movie in at least 30 years; the special effects of such pitiful cheesiness you feel like your kid did them on his Apple while watching TV. (The little dioramas of Fredericksburg Va. seem especially pathetic) But what it lacks is more telling a solid narrative structure. ""Gettysburg"" told of a single event from a multiplicity of points of view and it encapsulated the rhythms of battle as it surged toward climax followed by equal measures of despair and triumph. It is a tragic but unavoidable fact Whatever battles may lack in niceties they make up for in narrative efficiency which is why so many great novels have been written about them. The big fight starts it rises and falls it reaches a hideous peak. When its over lots of folks are dead and the landscape made bloody is forever changed. And within that narrative were smaller even tighter narratives ""Gettysburg"" turned on a Maine regiments desperate stand at Little Round Top and it was the movies strongest sequence an epic American ""Iliad"" fought on a 50-foot-high stone lump in Pennsylvania. By contrast ""Gods and Generals"" recounts a larger less focused tale which begins before secession ambles through the first few years of the war covers three separate battles (First Manassas Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville) while ignoring others (no Antietam the bloodiest day in American history) and eventually arrives just where the first movie began with the forces marshaling in southern Pennsylvania for a big go. It offers story but of a different sort -- story not out of events but out of biography. The focus here -- despite the presence of Jeff Daniels repeating as Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain the Maine hero of Little Round Top and Robert Duvall as an almost ethereal Robert E. Lee -- is on that perplexing figure Gen. Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson played by Stephen Lang. There is no doubt that this is a promotion for Lang who merely played the charge-leader George Pickett in the first film. There is no doubt he is a superb actor and there is no doubt that he communicates the force the intellect the commitment the righteousness and the love that comprised that most revered of Confederate generals. And yet somehow it doesnt quite work. Writer-director Ron Maxwell is a literalist not an interpreter and he has chosen to give us Stonewall straight on exactly as his letters and contemporary accounts recorded him. I can see the argument That is the man here are his words here are his deeds. What more is there? Yet there needs to be more somehow. Maxwell hasnt made any attempt to find a gesture or an anecdote that will dramatize the complexities of Jackson to a modern audience. Somehow its too much and not enough at once to repeat Jacksons dying declaration or his many recorded speeches. The past is an undiscovered country; things were different then. For one thing the educated man didnt speak in words but in prose vividly complete thorough and time-consuming. There being no other distractions nobody was in a hurry to get to the point except possibly Grant which may be why he won. So when Jackson over and over speechifies to subordinates and colleagues it is certainly historically true. But Maxwell and Lang havent found a way to make these chunks of language seem spontaneous or found a way to let us see into the mind that could create them. He remains a figure; hes never a character. But its not as if the stiff Maxwell had a choice. He attempts a more believable emotional intimacy between Daniels Chamberlain and his wife (played by Mira Sorvino) as Chamberlain then a college professor sets off for that cruel war his mind full of doubt. Good lord does it blow Its like a parody on ""Saturday Night Live"" wretchedly sentimental and emotionally unpalatable. Again these may be true words as recalled from diaries; yet the director and his cast havent found a way of making them sing. They seem rote and comically dense. What Maxwell does well he actually doesnt do that well really. But he is able to move big bodies of men around smoky fields amid electrically detonated flash pots. It seems that each reenactor chosen to die does so under the impression theres an Oscar category for Best Death Throes by an Extra. You never saw so much twisting and shouting in the ranks in your life. And Maxwell seems always to be looking for ways to annoy He endlessly identifies officers who have no lines and no influence on events. Occasionally he stirs himself to a moment of poetry as he did in ""Gettysburg"" in his evocation of Round Top. In ""Gods and Generals"" the lyric moment comes when for once he liberates his camera and follows Jackson and his command staff on a sweeping ride across the field at First Manassas a sequence that captures the fury of the horse as deployed in 19th-century war as well as a stunning evocation of the glamour of the men who rode them into the guns. But far more typically the camera observes the battle as if peeking over Gods shoulder watching the deaths of the anonymous little yeomen from way up yonder. Its magnificent but is it war? Gods and Generals (216 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for routine battle violence.

Interested viewers will be better off waiting for that -- or for producer Ted Turner to get the lumbering Civil War epic aired on cable. Its hard to imagine anyone but the most fervid Blue and Gray enthusiast taking another look if they enter the battle now. Equally unimaginable an editing crew that couldnt find an hour of parlor songs poetry and husband-wife chatter to hack out of a movie about the battles of Bull Run Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville. Review of the movie Gods and Generals ( out of four) Stars Jeff Daniels Stephen Lang Robert Duvall Mira Sorvino Kevin Conway Director Ronald F. Maxwell Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for sustained battle sequences Opens Friday nationwide Based on Jeffrey M. Shaaras novel Generals opens promisingly with a lovely credits sequence involving flags followed by a crisp scene in which Gen. Robert E. Lee (Robert Duvall) turns down command of the Union Army. After that it turns into a this-happened-then-this-happened recitation. Bad actors or normally competent ones (Jeff Daniels Stephen Lang) serve up stilted deliveries of stilted dialogue in a near-flashback to the filmstrips we used to see in school. Visually the movie seems more archaic than the racially odious but cinematically fluid The Birth of a Nation which came out in 1915. Director Ronald F. Maxwell previously made 1993s Gettysburg in which Daniels also played Union Lt. Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. I know Daniels was better in that one and memory also tells me that the movie was better. Maxwell saves his most numbing drag for the end an episode between Langs Stonewall Jackson and a little girl and Jacksons interminable deathbed scene. You dont envy the three soldiers who get shot for desertion but you do identify with their desire to flee.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Posted March 7 2003 -- 1200 AM EST In almost every way this 3-hour-and-35-minute prequel to 1993s Gettysburg starring Robert Duvall as Robert E. Lee and Stephen Lang as Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson is a trial to sit through stiff ponderous fluttering and crudely simplistic as an apologia for the Confederate ideology. It would be nice to say that the battles are powerful but instead they are draped in Civil War-buff ""authenticity"" without so much as a drop of carnage.

Younger auds will retreat en masse leaving the field to older moviegoers and Civil War buffs able to tolerate the slogging pace long speeches and extremely noble sentiments. ""Gods and Generals"" is American history transformed into a museum movie consistently making the flawed human characters at the heart of the Civil War into flawless figures Olympian in their statuesque remoteness. As the intended first part of a Civil War trilogy by producer-writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell this nearly four-hour section (including intermission) falls chronologically just before Maxwells previous ""Gettysburg"" which was a far more invigorating epic. Younger auds will retreat en masse leaving the field to older moviegoers and Civil War buffs able to tolerate the slogging pace long speeches and extremely noble sentiments for the chance to see some thoroughgoing battle reenactments. In contrast to ""Gettysburgs"" original life as a cable entry ""Gods and Generals"" was made for the big screen -- with a much higher production standard exemplified by Kees Van Oostrums rich and full-bodied widescreen cinematography. But it also stops still at any moment for lengthy speeches on subjects from devout Christian faith to military strategy that may end up playing better on the small screen. As cinema new pic feels like one of the longer-playing American films of the modern era. A 40-minute intro section establishing key players involved in the three central battles of the wars first years invites comparisons to static early talkies (""Disraeli"" among others) in which thesps were directed to stay still and talk as long as possible. Later on the fields of battle action helps pull the movie out of this trap but even then the stentorian and humorless approach recalls sword-and-sandals epics of the 50s and 60s. As he did with Michael Shaaras book ""The Killer Angels"" for ""Gettysburg"" Maxwell compresses Shaaras son Jeffs tome but with a crucial alteration While Jeff neatly balanced his study among four dominant characters -- Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain and Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock for the North Gens. Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson for the South -- Maxwells storytelling leans heavily in favor of Jackson (Stephen Lang) a movieish war hero who shifts from fascinating in the early going to boring by the finale. Besides rampant dramatic problems this also has the dubious effect of delivering a movie that shows far greater sympathy on screen to the Southern cause than to the North. Rejecting an offer to lead the Northern Army due to his home Virginia sentiments Lee (Robert Duvall) establishes the pics only real thematic focus -- that attachment to home and locality trumped patriotismto the Union. Teaching at his beloved Virginia Military Institute Jackson witnesses the pulling down of the Union flag in favor of the Confederate colors and with Virginia ratifying secession these soldiers duties are clear. Even before the underwhelming 15-minute depiction of the so-called first Bull Run battle long speeches on faith and loyalties sap the intended dramatic build and even Jacksons legendary firmness in the face of Union artillery doesnt deliver the heroic moment it should be. It isnt until nearly the one-hour mark that the North is personalized in the form of Chamberlain (Jeff Daniels) teaching at Maines Bowdoin College and discussing with worried wife Fanny (Mira Sorvino) his intentions to enlist. Domestic scene is designed to balance the far more wooden ones involving Jackson and his wife Anna (Kali Rocha) and reps new pics wider but stilted view of womens involvement in the war. Soon Chamberlain is with brother Thomas (C. Thomas Howell) on the training field in scenes that will have added resonance for viewers of ""Gettysburg"" in which the brothers become the heroic center. Joining the Chamberlains is Irish-born Union Sgt. Kilrain (Kevin Conway) a fellow with more color and verve than anyone else on either side. Centerpiece battle is at Fredericksburg starting at pics 90-minute point and spilling over past intermission. The enactment is remarkably detailed but only rarely does real human conflict rise to the surface -- as when Gen. Hancock (Brian Mallon) contends with Union leadership over its flawed tactics. Buffs should appreciate a brief five-minute section depicting urban street warfare in the town of Fredericksburg and a climatic skirmish between Irish units on both sides stirs short peaks of emotion. By far the best battle staging is kept for the end as Rebel troops make a brilliant end-around move on the Union flanks at Chancellorsville. Staging music and editing finally come vividly alive as the lurking maneuver designed by Lee and Jackson becomes a military dance of thrilling drama. But pic soon returns to its old ways as Jackson is felled by ""friendly fire"" and ends up lying on his deathbed for an endless 20 minutes.While Lang lacks the tools needed to bring Jackson alive and approachable thesp is surely hampered in the epic role by scripts characterization of the Southern hero as an intensely religious man. Like the rest of the film depiction seems willing to sacrifice dramatic common sense for an unplayable technical accuracy turning this Jackson into someone contempo filmgoers may view as nearly mad if not laughable. Remaining cast is equally if less severely constrained with not a single bad guy in sight to quicken the pulse. Mallon a fine stage thesp brings some spit and fire to his Hancock but hes given little screen time. Daniels usually loose manner is completely hemmed in here. Notable politicos playing dress-up populate the background surely making for a fun viewing game for Beltway insiders. Technical re-enactment is aces especially in the Chancellorsville sequence. Pics eye for historic detail is admirable made clear from opening credits rolling in front of a beautiful montage of several of the wars military flags. Van Oostrums lensing Richard LaMottes costumes and Michael Z. Hanans design are craftwork at their best while music scored by John Frizzell and Randy Edelman is usually overbearing. Closing credit notes trilogys final installment is titled ""Last Full Measure."" Credit crawl given lengthy technical crew is as uncommonly rapid as previous events are slow. For the record the second half is introd with four minutes of intermission music. Gods and GeneralsProductionThis review was corrected on Feb. 18 2003.
