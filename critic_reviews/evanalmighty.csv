"Steve Carells Evan Almighty reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steve Carells Evan Almighty reviewed. Steve Carells Evan Almighty reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 22 2007 428 PM Evan Almighty A movie that only an 8-year-old Christian environmentalist could love. By Dana Stevens Steve Carell as Evan and Morgan Freeman as God in Evan Almighty Like the modern-day ark that its hero risks his job his family and his reputation to build Evan Almighty feels like a vast ponderous folly. Its a deeply strange movie--in part because its so conventional. Fans of the perverse Steve Carell found in The Office The Daily Show and The 40-Year-Old Virgin -the Steve Carell who as Seth Rogen observed in that movie is so nice he just has to be a serial killer--will be disappointed to find here a Carell whos just nice. Evan Baxter the workaholic Congressman-turned-latter-day-Noah is a character that could just as easily have been played by Steve Martin (in his current family-friendly incarnation) or God forbid Tim Allen. Though its a loose spinoff from the 2003 Jim Carrey hit Bruce Almighty the plot of Evan Almighty owes a greater debt to the 1977 Carl Reiner comedy Oh God in which John Denver plays a supermarket manager visited by the Supreme Being (George Burns). Like Denvers character Evan starts out as a dubious semi-believer whos eventually converted into a do-gooding true believer. But whereas Oh God was charmingly irreverent--a religiously themed movie even an atheist could love--Evan Almighty bears the stamp of the Bush era. Its politics may be nominally green (the Lords ultimate goal is to stop environmentally harmful legislation) but its approach to revelation is strictly constructionist. When God (Morgan Freeman) instructs Evan to re-enact Genesis 614 He means His instructions to be taken as literally and biblically as possible right down to the vintage pre-Flood tool kit the facial hair and the flowing robes. Advertisement Evan his wife Joan and their three sons Shem Ham and Japheth (just kidding Dylan Jordan and Ryan) have recently moved to a D.C. suburb called Prestige Crest thats built on the site of a once-pristine valley. Having run for office (for which party? were never told) on a ""Change the World"" platform Evan promptly sells out to a powerful congressman (John Goodman) whos pushing a bill that would allow development inside national parks. Do you see where this is going? Trees will be hugged parks saved unscrupulous legislators vanquished--and one man will learn to spend more time with his family. This is the Old Testament minus the wrath divine retribution as chicken soup for the soul--wheres the fun in that? Reportedly a huge percentage of the movies 175 million budget--its one of the most expensive comedies ever made--went for animal wrangling and special effects. The scenes of birds and beasts following two by two after Carell as he makes his way up the Capitol steps or hammers away at his boat are visually impressive but joyless--who would want to save species as docile and plodding as these? Except for the copious bird-poop gags and a few baboon hijinks these expensively wrangled and CGI-enhanced beasts might as well be made of wood. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Lauren Graham who was razor-sharp as Lorelai on Gilmore Girls gives an unfocused performance as Evans wife and Wanda Sykes snappy delivery cant save the flaccid punch lines given to her character. She plays Evans ""executive assistant"" and the fact that the only black woman in this apparently all-white all-male Congress is a secretary is hereby noted with a resigned sigh. A running joke has Carells Evan ""doing the dance""--breaking out into a stiff white-mans boogie to celebrate moments of domestic joy. But during the goofy final credit sequence Carell pulls out the stops and really dances with the rest of the cast and crew--idiotically suggestively hilariously. Its a reminder of what a gifted comic he can be when not called upon to stand as the defender of family values and mammalian pair-bonding. I really hope Evan Almighty doesnt become a surprise hit with a niche audience (Christian environmentalist 8-year-olds?). Too much worldly success might tempt Steve Carell away from the righteous path of making movies as dark weird and funny as he is himself.

"Evan Almighty Preacher feature | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEvan Almighty Preacher featureNeither biblical disaster nor heavenly treat the underwhelming Evan Almighty can still lay claim to a superlative its the bravest (or craziest) movie of 2007.Steve Carell as Evan Baxter in a scene from ""Evan Almighty.""By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 22 2007 Starring Steve Carell Morgan Freeman John Goodman and Wanda Sykes. Directed by Tom Shadyac. At major theatres. 95 minutes. G Article Continued Below Neither biblical disaster nor heavenly treat the underwhelming Evan Almighty can still lay claim to a superlative its the bravest (or craziest) movie of 2007.Universal Studios rolled the dice to the tune of 200 million (U.S.) reportedly the most ever paid for a comedy hoping filmgoers will flock to a Sunday school sermon about loving thy neighbour and protecting thy planet. Its a huge gamble for a franchise that is missing both its original star and its edge while adding a great deal of Christian piety to its family-oriented messages. You could easily imagine Billy Graham slipping Evan Almighty into his home DVD player when it ships to disc. The film largely forsakes the sharper and more adult comedy of its 2003 predecessor Bruce Almighty which starred Jim Carrey as a disgruntled Buffalo TV newscaster upgraded to universal deity by a miffed and mischievous God (Morgan Freeman).Carreys foil in Bruce Almighty was a rival newshound played by Steve Carell. Carreys decision not to make the sequel has moved Carell to the lead role and his character Evan Baxter has also been promoted no longer a journalist hes now a freshman congressman elected on the modest election slogan to ""Change the World.""First he relocates shifting his wife (Lauren Graham) and three sons (Johnny Simmons Graham Phillips and Jimmy Bennett) from Buffalo to Huntsville Va. so as to be close to the seat of power in Washington D.C.Baxter is oblivious to the mixed messages hes sending out. Despite his promise to make the world a better place a vow he repeats on bended knee in his nightly prayers he moves into a land-grabbing mansion and acquires a gas-guzzling Hummer.In his first day on the job in Congress he gets snookered into supporting the controversial bill of a wily senior congressman named Long (John Goodman) who wants to sell off so-called ""fringe areas"" of national parks to developers. But theres a bigger power player in Baxters life. Its God Himself whom Freeman again plays as an omnipotent and capricious Man from Glad type. He wants Baxter to build an Ark and fill it with pairs of animals. Theres going to be another mother of a flood and Baxter will be the new Noah.""You wouldnt do that again would you?"" Baxter asks.""You want to change the world"" God says. ""So do I.""Much of what follows is the predictable pattern of Baxter slowly accepting his divine assignment - replete with shaggy beard and sheepskin robes - while still attempting to maintain decorum around Congress and prove to his family that hes not insane.Thats a tough row to hoe when God keeps delivering tons of lumber to Baxters yard and animals keep showing up in pairs at inconvenient places - like the hundreds of birds that fly into Baxters office through an open window providing one of many jokes involving wayward bird droppings. Whatever happened to the clever sight gags about dogs on toilets one of the things that made Bruce Almighty superior entertainment? Director Tom Shadyac and writer Steve Oedekerk who also did Bruce Almighty seem to have run out of smart ideas replacing them with computer-generated groaners.Shadyac and Oedekerk also seem to have undergone some sort of religious conversion since Evan Almighty piles on the Providence. Aimed squarely at the same churchgoing audience that embraced The Passion of the Christ the movie plays like an updated account of the Bible tale of Noah and the Flood replete with a watery climax far more frightening than it should be for gentle family fare. But the special effects are so unconvincing especially the fake CGI animals that perhaps tots wont be too terrorized.The saving grace of Evan Almighty is the presence of Wanda Sykes as Baxters sassy office secretary who is as quick with a quip as she is to roll her eyes at what the TV guys are calling ""the weirdo with a beard-o.""She miraculously gets all the best lines something almost unheard of for a minor character in a major comedy. Thats what I call real divine intervention.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Friday June 22 2007 400 AM Evan Almighty A freshman congressman is chosen by God to build an ark for a coming flood. With Steve Carell John Goodman Wanda Sykes. Director Tom Shadyac (128). PG Some off-color humor. Area theaters. Its only fair that Steve Carell whose film career took off with his role as a hexed TV news anchor in the 2003 blockbuster ""Bruce Almighty"" take a curtain call in the sequel ""Evan Almighty."" But somewhere between the first and second films director Tom Shadyac and writer Steve Oedekerk either lost their edge or got religion. Instead of getting to be God as Jim Carreys gleefully power-hungry Bruce Nolan was Carells Evan Baxter is on a mission from God He has to build an ark before the arrival of a flood. This shift along with hordes of well-behaved (either trained or computer-generated) wild animals makes ""Evan"" a more family-friendly movie than ""Bruce."" But it loses the essential appeal of the original premise What would a mere mortal do if he were suddenly all-powerful? The studios attempts to sell the movie to church groups as a meaningful religious parable are funnier than anything in it. This film is to faith what a box of animal crackers is to nature. But the floods great. Since we last saw him Evan has become a U.S. congressman and is moving his family into a luxurious home in a new development carved out of a beautiful valley west of D.C. Hes a conspicuous consumer with a Hummer and high ideals for which he feels a need for Gods guidance. A quick prayer and here comes the Almighty (Morgan Freeman himself) to explain that Evan needs to build an ark. It takes a couple of miracles an overnight growth of biblical-length hair and beard and a gathering herd of paired animals to convince him but soon Evan and his three sons are setting to work on the big boat. Carell and Freeman are great together and Wanda Sykes acerbic humor is perfect for her role as Evans perplexed assistant. But John Goodman as a bullying Southern congressman who sets out to corrupt Evan the moment he arrives in the capital has an impossible task. Goodmans Congressman Long will have something to do with that inevitable thrill-ride flood but as a villain hes no match for it.

So ""Evan Almighty"" could double the poop jokes. Because its so true its not much of a punch line. But then ""Evan Almighty"" isnt much of a comedy either. Heres the funniest thing In trying desperately to reconnect with religious Americans Hollywood assumes religious Americans are so dumb theyll laugh at anything. Yep that oughta work Nobodys blown this much money building a wooden ship that couldnt fly since Howard Hughes pieced together the Spruce Goose. In the Bible it rained for 40 days and 40 nights; ""Evan Almighty"" is as dry as hardtack and has a soul the size of a roasted peanut. The truly pious must love those clapping monkeys because how could all this marketing research have gotten middle America so wrong? ""Evan Almighty"" is the movie-length equivalent of a pandering animal-reaction shot; for a reputed 175 million thats a lot of drooling dogs and defecating parrots. That it may be the most expensive comedy ever made must have the devil giggling all the way to his fireside matinee. Count your blessings Its bad but its short. Steve Carell briefly reprises his role as the smarmy TV anchorman from the sequels genesis ""Bruce Almighty."" He makes a career 180 to be a smarmy congressman. Morgan Freemans God meanwhile makes a career 180 as well going from vengeful to merely smug. His designs for the honorable gentleman from Mesopotamia involve a little amateur boatbuilding and a lot of facial hair. Call it Sequels of a Lesser God - Freeman never explains why New Noah must build but it seems to involve exposing the venal sins of a corrupt congressman played by John Goodman. This is when the Biblical proportions seem all out of proportion. Set crews really did re-create the ark and the wrangling of thousands of animals for ""Evan"" is already Hollywood legend. All this to catch a corner-cutting committee chairman? Couldnt God just put the fear of himself into Jack Abramoff and spare the trees it took to build this ship of fools? ""Bruce Almighty"" though far from a perfect comedy had an edge to its humor and theology that kept the pace moving. Jim Carrey the ultimate narcissist accused God of being a narcissist and then paid for the blasphemy by learning for a few days just how omniscience might feel. ""Evan"" sinks under the helmsmanship of returning director Tom Shadyac and a roomful of screenwriters who trained on the Letterman show but who seem better at monotone than monologue. They shot for a milder PG rating in a conscious effort to reach the faithful of middle America opening with Carell and his onscreen wife Lauren Graham on their knees in prayer. Those shallow gestures doom ""Evan"" to bloated mediocrity. Its enough in this world view to pose an actor genuflecting without giving him anything worthy to think say or do. Hey how about an ark? Sure its been done. But not lately Verily perhaps I strike thee as a vengeful movie critic. Then feast thine ears on such erudition as this as Carell speaks to the gathering animals ""When youre on my lawn keep it in your butt."" Any movie that gives all the best lines to Wanda Sykes when Sykes receives only seventh billing in the credits has fulfilled its low expectations. ""Evan"" steals one of its best lines from ""Jaws"" when Carell looks over the transom at a gathering crowd and says ""Were going to need a bigger boat."" What we need are screenwriters who can build more than a cartoon ark. The Western religious traditions are rich with love hate humor cruelty and pathos. Hollywood will never regain the trust of red state-of-mind voters if it continues to ignore the babe in the manger and only offers what gets swept out of the stables.

"When Evan Almighty gets political just say Noah - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW When Evan Almighty gets political just say Noah By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  June 22 2007 When Morgan Freeman prevails upon me to say part the border fence and let the illegal immigrants go I hope that assignment proves more compelling than watching Steve Carell build an ark in ""Evan Almighty ."" This wimpy family comedy tries half-heartedly to fuse the planets ecological woes with much of the countrys religious convictions while taking broad swipes at legislative malfeasance in the Capitol. If that combination sounds remotely enticing wait for the ""South Park "" episode that would do it justice.In the meantime this is a harmless excuse to watch cute critters (from farm forest and jungle) harass Carell as he reprises an expanded version of a minor but funny role he played in ""Bruce Almighty "" that Jim Carrey smash from 2003. In those four years the American film comedy landscape has changed significantly. Carrey who even then seemed desperate for darker movies has all but renounced gangbusters slapstick and Carell while being a very different sort of actor (his m.o. is internal combustion) now seems the brighter star.Only in the last 30 minutes does ""Evan Almighty"" put his gifts to decent use. Epically hairy and biblically robed Carell suggests at that point what a bolder more psychologically serious treatment of religious conviction would have been like. Until then he seems like Paul Lynde freaking out in a high-concept kiddie comedy from the 1970s.When his character Evan Baxter  is elected to Congress he quits his news anchor job and moves his wife (Lauren Graham  languishing in a long-suffering-wife role) and their three sons from Buffalo into an exurban Virginia McMansion overlooking an expanse of barren lots. On the eve of his first day in office he prays for help in changing the world. Changing Tom Shadyacs mercilessly broad direction would have been more useful. Most of the gags are underscored by grubby close-ups. One shot pulls in tight for a movie theater whose marquee reads ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin Mary "" (har har). The filmmaking is the equivalent of large type.After seeing the numbers 614 wherever he goes (a nod to that fateful passage in Genesis) Evan receives a visit from God whos still played by the supremely mellow Freeman. For days Hes been having lumber and tools dropped off outside Evans house. Animals have been following him in twos to his roomy office (birds of all feathers flock over him like storm clouds that rain poop) and as an interesting companion development to Carells chest-waxing sequence in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin "" Evans hair refuses to stop growing. Indeed God wants this man to be his Noah and build an ark in preparation for a Great Flood.But Freemans is not a wrathful Lord. Frankly his unflappable incarnation wouldnt be out of place in a Cheech and Chong movie. Most of the storys energy is spent building to Evans showdown with John Goodman  as a crooked senior congressman who wants Evan to co-sponsor a shady land-use bill. No ones party affiliation ever comes up but apparently God wants more church in His state. Shockingly this flood is less an allergic reaction to any global catastrophe and more the result of what happens when a studio has too much cash to blow on a wild effects sequence.Actually at a rumored 175 million the movie tops ""Waterworld "" as the most expensive aquatic comedy ever made. The resulting merits of such an achievement are debatable. (Is a big budget like a musical score best undetected?) Hopefully a lot of that money went to Wanda Sykes  who plays one of Evans staffers. Its a huge relief to see that in a movie full of critters Sykes for once is playing a human. She wins most of the movies laughs tossing barbs at anyone she can. When Carell comes to work with a beard and mane one of her Teflon putdowns is ""You look like a Bee Gee.""Shes the riskiest sharpest thing in a movie that strives to be all things to all people. That might work for God and certain politicians but its a monotonous approach to comedy.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/ movies/blog.

Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) speaks to his audience as he prepares to board his ark in a comedy of biblical proportions Evan Almighty. Photo Universal Studios Evan Almighty 1 / 2 Back to Gallery This isnt Bible study or anything but has no one in suburban Virginia heard of the Covenant of the Rainbow? Yahwehs apres-flood promise to Noah that he wouldnt destroy the face of the Earth with torrential rains ever ever again? Once was enough I thought. But in Evan Almighty U.S. Rep. Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) predicts a flood. His hair grows super-long which is funny and his beard resists shaving which is also funny and an aide played by Wanda Sykes calls him a Bee Gee which is funny if you lived through the 70s or Barry Gibbs guest stint on American Idol depending on your age. Jerks in the media call him the New York Noah"" (hes from Buffalo) and cat-calling crowds gather outside his home where he is per godly instruction assembling a 300-by-50-cubit ark designed to survive a deluge. The skeptics think hes nuts man but no one ever thinks to ask ""Uh Evan? Have you read Genesis lately?"" Apparently not. In Tom Shadyacs followup to his own nuttier Bruce Almighty Carells big-mouth broadcaster is now a newly elected Congressman a job he scored by vowing to ""change the world."" On the very first night in his very new home his wife (Lauren Graham) and three boys tucked in Evan gets on his knees and hesitantly asks for guidance. Next morning his alarm goes off at 614 (as in chapter and verse Make thee an ark of gopher wood) and Evan finds a mysterious box of tools at his doorstep. Soon he gets a visitation from the Lord Himself (Morgan Freeman again divine in a white-linen shirt). Their meet-and-greet lacks both the kibitzing quotient of George Burnss Oh God movies and the addled bafflement of Bill Cosbys Noah routine instead suggesting a gentle paternal taskmaster and his thickly obstinate son. To prove his omniscience God informs Evan that his right nipple is a quarter-inch higher than his left but the freshman politico ignores this startling piece of info and instead returns to the hard work of sucking up to senior Congressman Long (John Goodman) on a quest to rape the environment. God and animals intervene Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or maybe the National Zoo. Without giving away anything concrete lets just say that Evans ark-construction-business proves justified while Gods plan -- quite an impressive eco-stunt -- proves less genocidal than activist. The path to the climax involves many tender lessons (on love obedience and mallet use) and oodles of animals arriving in pairs as biblically designated. Some of them are real some computer-generated; some like the pooping birds who follow Evan to his office on Capitol Hill made me pity the star and admire the animals trainers. Shadyac and Bruce scribe Steve Oedekerk (with others) have made a movie best suited to younger children who will yuk at the obvious sight gags and ooh at the digitized visuals. I confess though not in the spiritual sense that my 6-year-old son had an unqualified blast. But my 13-year-old hated it. My 11-year-old shrugged. So did I The sum effect is mild yet strange lacking both the zing of smart comedy and the cohesion of sensible plotting. Even a film with celestial directives should follow basic logic but Evan Almighty never explains why paired-off global fauna might congregate on a North American woodworking project. Hawks and squirrels sure but giraffes? Wouldnt they be more comfortable on a veldt somewhere? Once again visuals trump logic Its been ordained.

The other presence is the city itself -- vast throbbing with life teeming with misery and as depicted here all but unfathomable to Westerners seeking to penetrate its secrets. This is a smart and serious film however much it may also function as a star vehicle. The director Michael Winterbottom working from a script by John Orloff has turned Mariane Pearls memoir into a relentlessly intense drama about the search for her husband as well as her search for meaning in his death. And the immediacy of the setting heightened by documentary techniques makes this a chastening film a portrait of the explosive new world in which we live. In her own portraiture Ms. Jolie mixes tenderness with implacable toughness. She plays Mariane a journalist herself and six months pregnant at the time as a wife who loves her husband passionately but a woman with no time or inclination for the niceties of behavior once its clear he has been taken prisoner. At that point she becomes an obsessive organizer of the search and a compulsive scourge of anyone who threatens to stand in her way. (One fatuous Pakistani functionary insists that the abduction is an Indian plot.) Given Angelina Jolies celebrity the obvious danger in such a take-no-prisoners style of acting was imposing herself on the real-life story but that hasnt happened. To the contrary the actress enters the character and stays there even during her feral cries in the films most harrowing scene. ENLARGE Dan Futterman (right) as Daniel Pearl and Angelina Jolie (left) as his wife Mariane in A Mighty Heart. Daniel Pearl is played by Dan Futterman (who oddly in this context may be best known as the Oscar-nominated screen writer of ""Capote""). The reporter is seen fleetingly at first as he arrives in Karachi from Islamabad then goes to his fateful meeting with a supposedly legitimate source for a story he was doing on the shoe bomber Richard Reid. I didnt know Danny so all I can say about Mr. Futtermans performance is that it and his physical resemblance to his character seem persuasive. But Dannys character seems persuasive too -- not a hero of the war on terror as some have sought to cast him and certainly not the incautious naif that others have thought him to be but a first-rate reporter of maturity reflexive decency insatiable curiosity reasonable prudence and unreasonable dedication to finding the truth of whatever story he might have been working on. Against most Hollywood odds Danny Pearls tragically truncated life story has fallen into good hands thanks to the films producers (first among them Brad Pitt) and to the filmmaker they entrusted with the production. For much of the past decade Michael Winterbottom who was born in England has been refining his agile style in such extraordinary films as ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" and ""In This World"" and in last years ""The Road to Guantanamo."" Its a style that integrates drama and documentary footage mixes professional with non-professional actors and yields a sense of place thats as vivid as anything seen on TV news. ENLARGE On one occasion the stylist stumbled. ""The Road to Guantanamo"" was long on immediacy but short on factuality. And one aspect of the technique here amounts to tacit editorial comment. Through the use of oppressive close-ups quick cuts film-noir peeks into labyrinthine neighborhoods and long lenses that compress the confusion of Karachis streets into pandemonium the director and his Danish-born cameraman Marcel Zyskind have made the city seem endlessly menacing. What would the same locales have looked like if theyd been shot by a Third World filmmaker? Yet the films point of view is inevitably that of an outsider which Danny Pearl was and menace is the essence of this shattering story which has been told with skill and urgent conviction. ""A Mighty Heart"" makes the terms of the terrorist threat palpable. Evan Almighty When God commands a modern-day Noah to build an ark in ""Evan Almighty"" he gives him a book called ""Ark Building for Dummies."" This is movie-making by and for dummies a sappy little bible story blissed out on its own ineptitude thats full of birds (plus their doo) that looks like ""The Birds"" when it isnt aping ""Dr. Dolittle"" and that is definitely though far from incidentally for the birds. ENLARGE Steve Carell in ""Evan Almighty The Evan of the title is Evan Baxter last seen in the 2003 Jim Carrey comedy ""Bruce Almighty."" Evan played by Steve Carell was Bruces rival the self-satisfied TV newscaster who suddenly began to spout gibberish on the air. (More gibberish that is than TV newscasters usually spout.) Mr. Carell plays Evan again but this time in Jim Carreys absence his character has graduated from bit player to hero and from newscaster to a freshman congressman who got elected with the hollow campaign slogan Change the World. (Which is admittedly no more hollow than the gibberish that political candidates usually spout.) God is played once again by Morgan Freeman whose suave charm can sell all sorts of silliness but not the amiable imbecility peddled by this film. None of it makes much sense. Gods commandment kicks in after Evan proves himself a poor steward of the environment -- he drives a Hummer and lends his name to a bill that will destroy the national parks. But why would that make him a candidate for ark captain? And why do people think hes crazy since hordes of animals as well as birds follow him wherever he goes? Though these are troubling questions their significance pales in comparison to the idiocy of Evans itinerary. His vessel travels only from suburban Virginia to Capitol Hill on a flood tide thats mostly inside the Beltway. Still thats far enough to be certified as a ride. Look for an ark sometime soon at a theme park near you.    DVD TIP In a comic vein Michael Winterbottom has made such exhilarating intricate films as ""Tristram Shandy -- A Cock and Bull Story"" (2005) a postmodern rendering of the 18th-century novel by Laurence Sterne and ""24 Hour Party People"" (2002) a docudrama about the Manchester music scene of the 1980s and 90s. Both of them star the irrepressible English actor Steve Coogan.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 22 2007 Save for later Saved In ""Bruce Almighty"" Steve Carell played the newscaster who was chief rival to Jim Carreys title character. He stole all his scenes and since then has become something of a one-man cottage industry.As the star of ""Evan Almighty"" a spin-off of the earlier movie Carell appears in practically every scene. Right away hes in trouble since this champion scene-stealer cant steal scenes from himself.Director Tom Shadyac who also made ""Bruce Almighty"" draws on our fond memories of Carell from that film but he also includes in-jokes relating to other Carell films. In ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" for example Carell had his chest waxed so in this film we see him snipping nostril hairs. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? As a freshman congressman now living with his family in northern Virginia Evan is invited to cosponsor a land development bill by a fat cat politico (John Goodman). Opting for power over time with his family Evan is soon handed his comeuppance. God played once again by Morgan Freeman in stylish whites orders Evan to build an ark to prepare his family and community for a great flood. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Evan figures out hes not crazy but everyone else thinks he is. A flock of birds that would give Hitchcock the willies descends on Evan in his congressional chambers - in one of the films few amusing set pieces - and leave their calling cards.Always a stickler for being clean-shaven Evans beard grows out uncontrollably. The ark building also takes on a life of its own. Helped by his sons and with planks and equipment provided by God Evan fulfills the master plan. God also has provided him with a book ""Ark Building For Dummies."" If you think that joke is funny you will love ""Evan Almighty.""For the rest of us the film is a so-so slog through a torrent of tired jokes. The animals that show up in twos are pretty to look at even though some of them are computer generated.Carell is a funny performer when hes in supporting roles or when hes working off the oddball comic rhythms of his co-stars. But in ""Evan Almighty"" he is too often portrayed as an Everyman with a flowing white beard and if there is one thing that kills comedy its sanctimoniousness. Grade CRated PG for mild rude humor and some peril.

"Evan Almighty Ark is wrong vehicle for Carell - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeEvan Almighty Ark is wrong vehicle for CarellBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 06/21/2007 033622 PM PDTUpdated 06/22/2007 031624 PM PDTIt would be wrong - or at least factually incorrect - to call ""Evan Almighty"" an unholy mess. If there is one thing this Old Testament comedy is its seriously devout. Also seriously unfunny. Its a kind of semi-sequel to ""Bruce Almighty"" the Jim Carrey box office blockbuster from 2003 in which the funniest recurring joke was an insufferable newscaster who was forced by God to speak in tongues on the air. That small role was played by Steve Carell an unknown who then went on to star in another hit ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" Now in the same way that God wants Evan Baxter to build an ark Universal Pictures wants Carell to build the studio another smash. ""Evan Almighty"" is a picture with more amusing asides - Evans local movie house is playing ""The 40 Year Old Virgin Mary"" - than outright laughs. Even the editing betrays a sense of desperation about the material. Its cut so tight that no one ever breathes they just talk as if setting the pitch of the dialogue at ""His Girl Friday"" speed would make ""Al mighty"" all righty. It doesnt. Carell isnt really an actor per se. Or a comedian. Unlike Carrey or Eddie Murphy - or in this case Wanda Sykes who plays the snarling major domo Rita in the congressional office to which Evan has been elected - Carell isnt intrinsically funny. You can see him working at it. When hes going to do a funny little dance he announces it first.Advertisement His stardom relies on being a likable square. Thats the foundation and full extent of Carells comic arsenal. And while it serves him well enough on the small screen small-laughs sitcom ""The Office"" it leaves him much more exposed on a larger canvas. Its why he was carefully surrounded by a confederacy of dunces in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" After being elected to Congress - a plot device that feels strained because the movie has nothing in particular to say about politics beyond the usual Capra-esque blah blah blah - Evan and his family move into a McMansion near Washington D.C. On his first night in the new house he gets down on his knees and prays ""God please help me change the world."" Demonstrating a surprising lack of omniscience for an all-knowing deity God (once again played by Morgan Freeman) apparently misunderstands and thinks Evan is speaking biblically not politically. He begins sending signals directing Evan to Genesis 614 which reads ""Make thee an ark of gopher wood."" Then he drops a huge pile of lumber in Evans yard from Go 4 Wood. Later he makes himself manifest to Evans wife (Lauren Graham) as a waiter named ""Al Mighty"" suggesting God could use better writers. One thing thats never clear is whether Evan has been elected to Congress as some kind of Rush-lovin wilderness despoiling neo-con. And if not why the first piece of legislation he hitches his star to is a bill that will open the national parks to development. This is boilerplate conservatism and yet that doesnt seem to be who Evan is. Its obvious to the audience that the Foghorn Leghorn legislator behind this land grab (John Goodman in what appears to be funeral makeup) is up to no good. But Evan isnt merely clueless hes so excited to be a co-sponsor of the bill that he blows off a family outing to read it. Among the movies lamest misfires is an attempt to show that hes too career driven and neglecting his kids who make a big show - too big - of being disappointed when he cancels on them. Another strange disconnect occurs when everyone - his loving wife Rita and what appears to be every newscaster in America - assumes Evan is crazy because he claims God has told him to build an ark even as vast herds of animals materialize around him in pairs. Birds do it bees do it even bears (but not in threes) do it. They swarm around Evan during hearings on Capitol Hill and back at the ark but no one else seems to think this astonishing menagerie suggests that everything Evan is telling them is true. Even his family abandons him for it. The animal scenes have their own visual power and comic energy but director Tom Shadyac and writer Steve Oedekerk (the original ""Bruce Almighty"" team) can never seem to find a way to make them pay off. Usually they just end in a hail of bird droppings. Its left to Sykes - who is making a career of roles that once would have gone to Thelma Ritter - to deliver the movies only actual funny lines. Shes a malevolent Greek chorus of one. When Evan leaves work cleanshaven one day and shows up looking like Serpico the next Rita inquires ""Why do you sound like Evan Baxter but look like a Bee Gee? Are you shooting up Rogaine?"" Even the movies comic references are circa Thelma Ritter. Shadyac directed ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" and ""Patch Adams"" which starred Robin Williams so hes obviously comfortable working with animals. But in ""Evan Almighty"" he seems determined to deliver a message thats a lot more spiritual than funny. `Evan Almighty Rated PG (mild rude humor some peril) Cast Steve Carell Morgan Freeman Lauren Graham John Goodman Wanda Sykes Director Tom Shadyac Writer Steve Oedekerk Running time 1 hour 30 minutesContact Bruce Newman at bnewmanmercurynews .com or (408)920-5004.

Starring Steve Carell Morgan Freeman and Lauren Graham. Directed by Tom Shadyac. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SFGate.com/movies.) The heat surrounding ""Evan Almighty"" has nothing to do with the movie itself and everything to do with Steve Carell a hot comic character who has seemed like he could do no wrong -- until now. This is a limp slow-moving and desperately unfunny comedy a sequel to ""Bruce Almighty"" and about the only thing that could possibly make that minor Jim Carrey film look better in retrospect. Maybe Carell felt he owed one to Tom Shadyac. The director cast Carell as a fatuous newscaster in ""Bruce Almighty"" and in that small role Carell stole the picture. It put Carell on the map and eventually led to the enviable but strange summit on which he finds himself today -- of seeing his name above the title on a worthless summer film. All right he did it. He paid back the director. But he mustnt ever do this again. Does Carell want to be Americas answer to Peter Sellers? Or does he want to be the next Tim Allen? Make no mistake thats the issue. The road to comic unimportance and artistic irrelevance is paved with innocuous comedies like ""Evan Almighty"" full of false sentiment false crises false family values false jokes and false emotion not to mention false beards. So heres some friendly advice to Carell Next time someone tries to hand you a script like this wear garlic pick up a cross and walk backward toward the exit. At least Carrey got to be God. That gave him considerable leeway. Carell only gets to be Noah -- and whats worse a post-recovery Noah passed the point described in the Bible in which he passes out drunk and naked and embarrasses his sons. Face it Eliminate the alcohol and eliminate the nakedness from the Noah story and whats left? Nothing but the tale of a guy with a lot of facial hair who takes on an extensive building project at the insistence of a powerful and influential client. The movies first bad move is to take Evan out of his job as a TV newscaster and turn him into a newly elected congressman. TV news funny. The House of Representatives not a barrel of laughs. As the movie starts Evan is feeling good about himself. He has bought a huge new house on a sprawling development in Northern Virginia and is enjoying getting called ""Congressman"" everywhere he goes. But then lumber starts arriving at the house. And then God starts showing up everywhere in the form of Morgan Freeman which surprisingly no one ever points out. No one ever says ""Lord you look like Morgan Freeman."" Anyway if youre reading this youre ahead of me just as anyone who sees ""Evan Almighty"" stays way ahead of the movie God tells Evan to build an ark and with that the story goes off on its predetermined course. You can guess the rest. In fact get out a legal pad and jot down the rest of the plot and youll probably nail it so long as you take special care to be unimaginative and avoid surprises. But please dont give this longer than 45 seconds. Dont work harder than the screenwriters. But why Noah? Obviously Jesus would be controversial and the Crucifixion would make a comedy impossible and Moses would open up the whole Middle East issue. But Abraham had a lot going on a lot of interesting family dynamic. Plus he almost kills his son which would have given Carell at least one dramatic scene to play. In ""Evan Almighty"" he has nothing to play -- not a single funny scene not a single dramatic scene -- just a series of interludes in which he plays mild embarrassment to John Goodmans blustering senior congressman. On the plus side its not unpleasant to see all the various animals showing up two by two on Evans lawn and the special effects near the finish are well done. But the closest thing the movie comes to a decent joke is the running gag in which Evan tries to shave and his beard grows back automatically. Carell should know better. He should have tried waxing it.

Outside their new McMansion a menagerie of wild beasts is assembling two by two. Stacks of new lumber appear mysteriously along with a nice set of B.C.-vintage tools. Old-fashioned family values and Old Testament thaumaturgy collide in Evan Almighty a pious slapstick spin-off of the Jim Carrey-plays-God comedy Bruce Almighty. Carell who costarred as Carreys Buffalo TV newsroom rival in the 2003 hit returns as Evan Baxter (and returns as a full-fledged comedy star thanks to The 40 Year Old Virgin) - although his days as an anchorman are over. Having run on a ""Change the World"" platform Evan has won a trip to Washington. He his wife and three sons decamp to suburban Virginia and Evan sets up office on Capitol Hill. Thats when the trouble starts First a fat-cat pol (John Goodman) recruits the freshman rep to cosponsor a bill to open the National Parks to private development. And then a mysterious grinning figure dressed in white appears. His name God (Morgan Freeman of course reprising his Bruce Almighty role). Gods directive Build an ark. Theres going to be a mighty flood and animals and people will need saving. Although Baxter and his wife are good practicing Christians the corporeal presence of the All-Knowing One is not an easy thing to deal with. Nor is Evans sudden animal magnetism Deer sheep hyenas snakes eagles lions anteaters . . . theyre descending on him dogging him so to speak. Is he going crazy? Is that why his hair is turning white? And whats with the biblical robes hanging in his closet? Evan Almighty written by Bruce Almightys Steve Oedekerk and directed by Tom Shadyac has a few flat-out funny moments but more often this is a comedy that panders to pip-squeak sensibilities (groin injuries bird-poop gags) to church-going types (Universal is marketing the film heavily to Christian groups) and to protect-the-planet enviros. In one scene God shows Evan the way his gated community Prestige Crest looked before the forests were felled and the strip malls built verdant Virginia wilderness with a river running through it. Carell has an easygoing comic style. Hes an Everyman with arched eyebrows and a capacity for subdued kookiness and even in the Noah garb he brings a down-to-earth quality to the modern-day miracle proceedings. But ultimately Evan Almighty is too sappy too sanctimonious. Even the beaming Freeman materializing in different getups (a waiter a motorcycle cop) to spread the Word becomes hard to take. Almighty hard. Evan Almighty  (out of four stars) Directed by Tom Shadyac written by Steve Oedekerk photography by Ian Baker distributed by Universal Pictures. Running time 1 hour 35 mins.

"Almighty Sequel Without a Prayer washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Almighty Sequel Without a Prayer Despite its rank as the costliest comedy ever made ""Evan Almighty"" fails to make a splash. (Universal Pictures Via Ap) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 22 2007 In ""Evan Almighty"" Mr. God goes to Washington. Frank Capra stop rolling in your grave. At least they cared enough to steal from the very best as the new Steve Carell comedy labors mightily to re-create the sublime pleasures of Capras humane and vivid populist rousers. Now that would truly be a miracle. If youve ever wondered what would happen if the Old Testament Jahweh was disguised as a twinkly-eyed 70-year-old African American dressed for tennis heres your answer. If you hunger to see Carell fall-down-go-boom a lot heres your movie. If you think John Goodman as a Kartoony-Korrupt-Kongressman sounds like a chuckle head to the multiplex. Like birds? Want to see lots of em? Here you go. And finally if you yearn to see the Great Fairfax Va. dam crack and spill millions of gallons of H2O on all points between it and the U.S. Capitol -- so long Arlington County -- youre in for some pretty big rib-ticklin The frail idea that supports the most expensive comedy ever made (210 million) is that a freshman congressman of good-hearted earnestness but unbelievable naivete (Carell) is designated by God (Morgan Freeman so damn twinkly he could put the night sky out of business) as Noah The Sequel. The first dead giveaway is a clock radio that reads Gen. 416 every morning. The next is the arrival of hand tools and several tons of gopherwood. Next all those animals two by two. Hmmm is this a trend or has life indeed gone all biblical for Carells poor Evan Baxter? For a time the movie tracks two plots Evans malleability in the halls of Congress where the Big Schmooze himself Goodman as Committee Chairman Long maneuvers him into supporting a bill that would -- get this -- allow developers to build on national parks. The schlub is so dumb that he doesnt see through the ruse nor does his knuckleheaded staff. (And why would a supposed smart operator such as Long put his own name on the bill? His smarter deal would be to get Baxter to front it by himself) In the second plot Evan is dealing with Mr. Gs inflexible decision to turn him into the boat-building harbinger of wet doom a job he doesnt want. But gradually the blow-dried congressman is turned into a shaggy-haired robe-wearing Marine. Theres a lot of oops-I-hit-my-thumb humor for those three of you who enjoy watching thumbs get hit. I couldnt help but think while watching this lame long thin sequence of a similar one in Steven Spielbergs ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" In that one another suburbanite (Richard Dreyfuss) is caught in the grip of a similar undefiable obsession imposed by forces on high to build the image of a mountain in the center of his tract house no matter what his wife kids and neighbors thought. The Spielberg sequence is sheer genius (I saw it again recently on cable) -- its both funny and poignant at once visually alive and a compelling portrait of a man obsessed a family riven and a society appalled while never losing touch with an overall sense of ominous change approaching. But the point isnt that Spielberg is a great director and the ungifted Tom (""Patch Adams"") Shadyac a hack its that Spielberg seized the possibilities of the medium while Shadyac sees nothing but the script. Shadyac who directed the previous incarnation ""Bruce Almighty"" doesnt even seem to grasp whats special about Carell. In the great ""40-Year-Old Virgin"" Judd Apatow used the comic actors thin quavery voice earnest mien awesome repression and fundamental decency to great effect; in affairs of the heart and glands his squeamishness and lack of self-confidence were hysterical. Shadyac seems to think hes a physical comedian and wastes almost half an hour on the endless I-hit-my-thumb stuff. Then he diverts to animal humor and uses the two-by-twoing of the worlds species in downtown D.C. and suburban Virginia for over-labored poop and flutter jokes of no weight and increasing inefficiency. In fact Carell was foolish to jump from Apatows shrewd adult comic sense to Shadyacs family-oriented fuzzy-lib sanctimony. When Shadyac directs an essentially undirectable force of nature like Jim Carrey or Robin Williams its their talent that carries the picture and he just stays out of the way. A quieter number like Carell needs to be used astutely and precisely so that the subtleties of face tone and body can come to play. But no Shadyac is too busy having him wipe that white splash off his shoulder. With the exception of Wanda Sykes as Evans saucy office manager none of the supporting characters registers. Even the genuinely great Freeman is doing an old act by old numbers and counting his bucks though most absurd is the wastage of Goodman as the nuance-free congressman. The big guy could have phoned it in from Miami. And finally the flood. Oh I know its a fantasy its a joke nobody should take it seriously. The expensive mayhem by tsunami that Shadyac unleashes is portrayed as comic and casualty-free but of course adults cant help but be disturbed by imagery of a catastrophe -- that would cost many thousands of lives -- being dismissed so casually. These arent the times for such cavalier treatment and Shadyac seems to have forgotten that the flood was the original weapon of mass destruction. Evan Almighty (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for rude humor and mild peril.

"Evan Almighty | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; evan-almighty ) Evan Almighty (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Finally a 2007 sequel thats demonstrably better than its predecessor Alas considering how bad Bruce Almighty was thats damning with faint praise. The central problem with Evan Almighty is that the filmmakers pack too much plot into what should be a relatively lightweight comedy. This results in too much exposition and too few laughs. Instead of developing a shell of a plot that allows star Steve Carell to take control with his low-key charisma and natural humor it saddles him with a narrative so preposterous that not even he can vault the barrier. Evan Almighty is amusing in pieces but taken as a whole it offers little and the morality lesson is galling. The premise of Bruce Almighty was that a normal human being was granted Gods powers while the Almighty (Morgan Freeman) took a vacation. Evan Almighty doesnt try to mine the same load and considering how poorly the first film did in that department we can be thankful. This time God is repeating himself. He commands news anchor-turned-freshman Congressman Evan Baxter (Carell) to emulate Noah and build an ark. (Baxter had a small part in Bruce Almighty.) The animals come two-by-two and all Evan has to do is get his big boat ready to float by mid-day on September 22. Pretty soon Evan looks like the guy who opens up the Monty Python TV series and has amassed an astounding menagerie. His wife (Lauren Graham) is worried about his sanity and decides that the safest action is to leave him. Meanwhile Congressman Long (John Goodman) wants him suspended and set up for public ridicule. Evan Almighty has a sense of humor although it is neither sophisticated nor evenly distributed. Early ark-building scenes with Carell displaying the actors capacity for physical comedy are worth a few laughs and the acerbic Wanda Sykes rarely opens her mouth without saying something amusing. (Considering the PG rating Sykes penchant for the rude and crude is effectively curtailed). Theres a lot of word play much of which deals with Genesis 614. Consider also the names of Molly Shannons realtor character (Eve Adams) and Gods fast food server (Al Mighty). The best gag of this nature a movie marquee that reads ""Now Showing The 40 Year-Old Virgin Mary."" Thats at least worth a smile. Tom Shadyac effectively muzzles Carell reducing the role into something any marginally talented comedian could undertake. I have no idea why Shadyac continues to get work. His movies vary from disappointing to unwatchable and Evan Almighty is another in a long line of lazy efforts. His partner in crime is screenwriter Steve Oedekirk who bears equal responsibility. Both men cut their teeth working with Jim Carrey on the Ace Ventura movies. Carrey has grown since those days but Shadyac and Oedekirk have not. While I freely admit that issues of credibility should not be deemed as major flaws in silly comedies the filmmakers desire to have this production taken seriously on some level opens it up for such criticism. Evan Almighty takes place near Washington D.C. - so where do the lions tigers elephants and pandas come from? Has there been a mass escape from zoos in the mid-Atlantic region? The fact that Evan his wife and three kids are able to build a mammoth seaworthy ark doesnt bother me but the animals do. Shadyac and Oedekirk would undoubtedly argue that were not supposed to think about such things but expecting a viewer to check his/her brain at the door is a cop-out especially when were obviously anticipated to process the message about the importance of faith. Evan Almightys climax boasts some of the worst CGI in any summer movie thus far in 2007. Its Titanic meets Jumanji and it looks like it was done on someones home PC. Have some respect for your audience Mr. Shadyac. If youre going to include a special effects sequence make it at least passable. This is a comedy but people shouldnt be laughing at supposedly serious shots of the boat making its way toward the U.S. Capitol. While I admit that Evan Almighty isnt as ineptly constructed and poorly realized as its predecessor this still isnt a wise investment of anyones entertainment dollar. Its not funny enough clever enough or spectacular enough. At best its made-for-TV fare masquerading as something more impressive to bilk movie-goers out of hard-earned money. Despite his considerable screen time Steve Carells abilities are criminally underused ending a string of successes that have included The 40 Year-Old Virgin Little Miss Sunshine and TVs The Office. Evan Almighty will probably be seen as test of Carells drawing power. Considering the movies quality thats unfortunate.

The movie warns of an imminent flood yet delivers only sprinkles of laughter or anything approaching magic. The problems with ""Evan Almighty"" mostly boil down to questions of scale. The movie warns of an imminent flood yet delivers only sprinkles of laughter or anything approaching magic. Its mildly diverting for kids and families in a way that would be perfectly fine as an ABC Family cable project (perhaps before ""The 700 Club"") but sails into the summer anchored to all the baggage and expectations a comedy with an enormous budget invites. Universal has courted church groups and will need them to line up two by two and then some to fully recoup on their epic investment. Although ostensibly plucked from the ribs of ""Bruce Almighty"" the 2003 comedy hit starring Jim Carrey ""Evan"" plays much more like an uncredited sequel to ""Oh God"" garnished with a dollop of ""The Santa Clause."" The film also reaffirms for anyone who doubted it Steve Carells arrival as a major comedy presence and asset to NBC Universal (featuring him in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and NBCs Emmy-winning ""The Office"") and his own appeal surpasses that of the movie itself. Carell -- reprising his role but going from supporting to lead -- and Morgan Freeman as God are the only onscreen ties to ""Bruce"" though director Tom Shadyac and writer Steve Oedekerk are also back on board. Even so the narrative immediately shifts venue jettisoning Evan from his status as a TV anchorman and into a newly won congressional seat. (Not to nitpick but nobody would be allowed to anchor the news during a campaign and right up until being sworn in as the movie suggests.) Loading up the Hummer Evan his wife (""Gilmore Girls "" Lauren Graham in an especially thankless spousal role) and their three sons zip off to Washington where she prays for a closer-knit family and he -- while not the praying type -- puts in a divine plea for help with his ""change the world"" campaign theme. Yet just as Evan begins to navigate his way around D.C. and earn the patronage of a powerful congressional ally (John Goodman) none other than God appears not-so-gently prodding him to build an ark. Its around here where one can see the dollar signs start to pile up as animals of all kinds (invariably in pairs) begin following Evan around eager to book their passage on the great big boat. Meanwhile his rapid hair growth and wardrobe change to a flowing robe render him an object of widespread ridicule (former ""Daily Show"" chums Jon Stewart and Ed Helms join in the mockery) testing both Evans faith and that of his family in him. Despite its unabashed spiritual overtones (seemingly augmented at every conceivable moment by John Debneys relentlessly grandiose score) ""Evan Almighty"" also weaves in an environmental message either shrewdly or cynically designed to have it both ways. Pic entices religious conservatives -- who tend to dismiss Hollywood as a den of iniquity -- with talk of God and nothing racier than bird-poop gags while still stroking the political left with a ""save the planet"" message. Beyond the cute animals and considerable technical effort expended to make their integration generally seamless Shadyac has wisely populated his human roles with big brassy comedic personalities like John Michael Higgins Wanda Sykes and Jonah Hill as Evans congres-sional aides who can wring maximum yuks from the minimal material. That said the sheer number of musical montages and repetitive prat-falls suggests the movie is laboring to stay afloat through feature length and the special effects during the climactic sequence are at best uneven. ""Evan Almighty"" is useful in one broader respect reminding cultural warriors that hedonistic Hollywood has no qualms about promoting religion if it can visualize a wide swatch of green at the rainbows end. As for whether reaching out to that traditionally elusive market sweet-ens Universals pot on this slight but expensive confection well Evan surely wont be the only one muttering a little prayer.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Marianes Labyrinth A Mighty Heart is a powerful journey down terrors rat holes. Plus French erotics and Hollywood piety. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Peter Mountain/Courtesy of Paramount Vantage) A Mighty Heart tells the story of the hunt in Pakistan for kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl through the eyes of his pregnant wife Mariane played by Angelina Jolie dipped in caramel. Aside from Joliewho is very fine though improbably castand a sprinkling of idyllic flashbacks (Daniel gazing into his wifes eyes Daniel caressing her swollen belly) the movie is clipped blunt and grimly realistic. It is practically a policier although the suspense is mitigated by our knowledge that the investigation will end badly. Theres surprisingly little in the way of politics (the director is the Brit Michael Winterbottom whos not known for reticence in that area) and no overarching messageapart from Pearls shining example as an investigative journalist. The conclusions we must draw for ourselves. The most obvious is that in late 2001 and early 2002 we (by which I mean the American media and its consumers) had little idea of the deadly labyrinth into which the war on terror would lead us. When we meet Pearl (Dan Futterman an uncanny look-alike) hes en route to interview a volubly anti-American sheikh possibly connected to would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid. Pearl is no naif but the meeting is supposed to take place in public in a restaurant; hes an internationally known journalistan unlikely target even as Jew for jihadists with a message to get out. From a taxi he phones his wife whos shopping for a dinner party that night to say he loves her and will try not to be too late. The team that subsequently forms around Mariane does not seem promising. Daniels colleague Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi) is of Indian descent and therefore suspect Some Pakistanis maintained that Pearls kidnapping was orchestrated by India to make their country look bad. A Journal editor (Gary Wilmes) is a bit of a nebbishnot particularly hard-driving. Will Patton plays the guy from the U.S. consulate and Patton has made a career of embodying shifty American officials. Theres no telling which side the Pakistani police captain (Irfan Khan) is on Americas so-called ally in the war on terror has been unreliable and Pearl was investigating alleged ties between Reid and its Police Department. The countrys press reports that Pearl is alternately an agent of the CIA or worse the Mossad. BACKSTORY Lady Chatterleys Lover has sparked controversy in film as well as print. The 1955 French adaptation LAmant de Lady Chatterley was finally released in the U. S. after a 1959 court battleNew York State banned it because it promoted adultery but the Supreme Court reversed that decision. Turns out that the state hadnt seen anything yet Though LAmant was tame subsequent films would push the limits of propriety culminating in Young Lady Chatterley (1977) and its 1985 soft-porny sequel Young Lady Chatterley II. Lady Chatterley tries to amuse herself with gardener reads the IMDB plot summary. But the view of A Mighty Heart (via a book by Mariane Pearl and Sarah Crichton) is that these men and women were finally heroic and that their combined efforts might have saved Pearl had his captors not been eager to humiliate the U.S. and Israel by turning his execution into a grisly propaganda tool. In the compound (while a woman in a headscarf washes the floors and the womans little boy plays in the courtyard) Mariane works the phones and Internet and diagrams the relationships of the major players. Theories are batted around leads pursued cell-phone records seized. Its a surrogate family. The Captain (as the Pakistani policeman is called) and a contingent of soldiers hunt down men who are links in the chain. Pattons Randall Bennett watches with approval (bordering on pleasure) as suspects are hung up beaten and dunked in water. Given that Winterbottoms last film was the righteous docudrama The Road to Guantanamo its a shock to see him dramatize torture so neutrally. The methods arent endorsed as in 24 but theyre unlikely in this context to make anyone yelp about the Geneva Conventions. Mariane Pearl is French and of partly Afro-Cuban descenta challenge for a Caucasian-American (even an exotic-looking one) to pull off. Its hard to forget shes who she is but Jolie is a remarkably canny actress and she plays Mariane with the kind of brusque economy that characterizes the real womans writing and public appearances. Jolie tamps down her drama-queen instincts. Her Mariane is not by and large an emoter When someone compliments her for holding herself together in a statement she tapes to her husbands captors she responds with disbelief. Her only false note is the fault of the script When she hears of the videotape that documents her husbands decapitation she snarls almost at once that she will never see it. Although Mariane reportedly hasnt seen it its unlikely she came out with the line in the throes of the horror. No one is that self-possessed. A Mighty Heart does not re-create any part of that videotape for which I am both grateful and sorry. Winterbottom shows admirable respect for Mariane Pearl and the memory of her husband but the film needs an exclamation point something visceral to drive home the fate of Daniel Pearl. In writing about this movie I finally forced myself to watch that video. Apart from my relief that the actual killing isnt shown I was struck by how pointed its message (as articulated by Pearl on-camera) is that no American is safe. Since then Pearls death has shown up in the culture in myriad forms if only subtextually in movies like Babel (where Americans appear chillingly vulnerable in the Third World). Even the splatter director Eli Roth (Hostel) invoked Pearls murder recently to justify the genre Ive dubbed torture pornand however opportunistic hes not wrong in claiming a link. Near the end of the film Jolies Mariane has the team over for dinner and thanks them for their help. She says they didnt failthat the aim of terrorists is instilling terror. Thats what A Mighty Heart for all its power doesnt do. 1 2 Next Share this story...
