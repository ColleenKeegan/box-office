Movies | By    Leah Rozen on April 28 2011  410 pm Email Print The fifth in the series moves from just pedal-to-the-metal into ""Oceans Eleven"" territory Car porn judging from the blissful grins on the many men in the audience at the screening I saw of ""Fast Five"" in Manhattan is as beloved by a certain half of the population as real porn. To qualify as car porn a movie must treat the vehicles shown -- mostly muscle cars -- with the same reverence and adoration if not more that it shows its human stars. The camera must caress every metallic line on the vehicles the lighting and cinematography bring out their shiny gleam and the soundtrack enhance the purr and roar of their accelerating engines. Its not enough that the cars in car-porn movies look good -- they also must perform with va-va-vroom. These babies must go fast bash into other cars into trucks into trains and into inanimate objects ... and then blow up. The noisier the better. An emphasis on and appreciation for cars has taken the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise a long way. The first ""The Fast and the Furious"" which starred Vin Diesel and Paul Walker came out 10 years ago and focused on the subculture of street racing and car theft in Los Angeles. Two years later ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" was set in Miami and had Walker driving fast and bringing down a drug dealer. The third 2006s ""The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"" relocated to Japan and tried putting in a no-name cast and making the cars the stars. The last film 2009s ""Fast amp; Furious"" re-teamed Walker and Diesel (as well as bringing back Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez the female leads from ""The Famp;F"") and had them zipping between L.A. and Mexico to bring down a drug dealer. Three out of the four of the original stars (Diesel Walker and Brewster) are back for ""Fast Five"" -- and the movie delivers all the fast cars action and tough guy talk fans could want. Two hours and three minutes worth. Director Justin Lin who handled the third and fourth films returns for another lap adroitly putting it through its paces Open with a well-executed high-speed stunt sequence in which Walker and Brewster help Diesel escape from a prison bus? Check. Send everyone down to Rio and mix up atmospheric shots contrasting beaches and favelas? Check. Stage a robbery in which fancy sports cars are downloaded from a moving train and then driven off at top speed through the desert? Check. As for plot we get our boys are on the run from the law. To finance a permanent escape to an extradition-free paradise they plan an elaborate 11 million heist of funds belonging to a powerful Brazilian drug lord. By cleverly putting more emphasis on the mechanics of assembling the crew for a heist and carrying off a complicated robbery ""Fast Five"" sets up for a focal switch in the franchise away from just pedal-to-the-metal to more of an ""Oceans Eleven"" and ""Italian Job"" kind of mode. It also introduces Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson into the mix as a steely law enforcement officer who likely -- per a scene at the end credits -- has a future with the franchise or in a spin-off series. All of that said ""Fast Five"" is grindingly   mechanical -- and not just because of all the emphasis on car repairs and retooling. Its full of expository howlers (""You realize were gonna go up against the most powerful guy in Rio and take all of his money?"" asks Walker recapitulating the basic plot for those who may have gone out for popcorn). And it doesnt help that Diesel Walker and Johnson collectively have an expressive range as wide as a stick of gum. But silly me no one goes to these movies for the acting or lyrical dialogue. They want tough. And really does it get any tougher than having Johnson when instructing an underling to shadow a suspect say ""If he goes to the john I want to know how many times he shakes it."" If Shakespeare had lived in an age when he could have climbed into a Corvette Pantera or Ford GT40 -- all autos that streak through ""Five"" -- Im sure he would have written exactly that same line.

""What pop-culture phenomenon runs on Diesel fuel?"" ""What is The Fast and the Furious film franchise?"" Yes the once-loud but oddly modest street-racing franchise has re-revved the engines on a fifth model. A decade after Dominic Toretto and undercover fed Brian OConner first squared off in the underground racing world of Los Angeles -- becoming family thanks to Doms sister Mia -- comes ""Fast Five."" This time the action is set in Brazils Rio de Janeiro and reunites the trio and their cohort in ""one last job."" You know the kind a payoff too big to resist a violent nemesis begging for a shellacking a heist that allows the tarnished heroes a graceful very comfortable exit. The chemistry of the core cast -- steered by Vin Diesel and Paul Walker -- keeps this outing from running on fumes. And things shift into a smoother gear when Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson arrive in Rio reprising their roles as gear-genius Tej and OConners childhood friend Roman. The two do an easy jig of competition and camaraderie. Shun Kang and Gal Gadot do a flirty sexy-nerd minuet as Han and Gisele. ""Fast Five"" offers fewer high-octane pleasures than earlier films although its not for lack of trying. Director Justin Lin has never been one to cheat on action set-pieces. Theres an almost-great train robbery at the start and a better if overlong chase-on-a-causeway finale. But the writing (by Chris Morgan) is often thuddingly leaden. ""Youre the only cop in Rio who cant be bought"" U.S. federal agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) tells Elena a Brazilian rookie played by Elsa Pataky. ""Am I right? Of course I am."" Hobbs tracks our fugitive heroes. A well-heeled baddie named Reyes is after them for different reasons. Reyes stores his ill-gotten drug gains -- 100 million anybody? -- in Rios hillside shanties or favelas. Portrayed by Portuguese-born actor Joaquim de Almeida he waxes smug on Brazils poorest the way a newfangled colonialist might. He sees Doms vulnerable spot in sister Mia. Dark-haired lean Jordana Brewster could be the young mans Demi Moore. (Except that Moore has turned out to be well a young mans Demi Moore.) Mia is pregnant and early action sequences of her and Brian escaping through a favela had us wondering just how much rigorous activity is good for an expectant mom. But thats not the point. Family values Dom-style is. Though central to the chase Hobbs presence feels incidental to this storyline. And one suspects that the heavily armed agents role provides the future video-game version with more single-player shooting action. ""Fast Five"" skids most when trying to engage deeper themes. (If you cant handle the heat of Brazils daunting inequities stay out of the favelas.) So its still an illegal race between friends in the wee hours that has the movie pur- ring and reminds us that ""The Fast and the Furious"" has often delivered stupid joys. An early Newtonian-physics-defying stunt features Dom Brian and a sleek silver Corvette roadster. Its an obvious wink to Butch and Sundances leap off a cliff meant to remind audiences -- especially those of us long in the tooth and starting to feel less comfy with so much blow-stuff-up action -- that we love on-screen lawlessness. We like our outlaws but dont take kindly to corruption. We root for the naughty guys over the nasty guys or the arrogant lawmen. We cheer for the multiracial Robin Hoods to vanquish a hood in a custom-tailored suit. We like our popcorn fantasies. Ladies and gentlemen start your engines.

Comments click to enlarge Fast Five Video Rated PG-13  130 minutes  2011 The fifth installment in the franchise that began with The Fast and the Furious (2001) pulls together veterans from the first four headed by Vin Diesel as the car-crazy thief and Paul Walker as the lawman turned outlaw. It also notably increases the number of chase sequences and resets the action to a fantasy Rio de Janeiro whose streets have rarely seemed less safe and whose police seem incapable of enforcing even the simplest traffic laws. Dwayne Johnson hops aboard as a stern U.S. agent hot on Diesels trail and the whole thing progresses to one of the looniest heists of all time. The result is the most exciting visually jazzy and absurd entry in the series. Justin Lin directed a script by Chris Morgan.

Fast Five reviewed a tenderhearted family drama starring Vin Diesel. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 29 2011 224 PM Fast Five A tenderhearted family drama starring Vin Diesel. By Dana Stevens Vin Diesel and Paul Walker in Fast Five When an unstoppable bald force meets an immovable bald object the result is Fast Five (Universal) the fifth installment in the Fast and the Furious series which pits burly car thief Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) against even burlier Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) in the favelas of Rio. Back for more drag racing prison-bus-jacking and other automotive mayhem are nearly all the regulars of the Fast franchise Jordana Brewster as Dominics lissome sister Mia Paul Walker as Brian OConner the FBI-agent-turned-fugitive who loves her and a lineup of trash-talking racially diverse speed demons that includes Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Sung Kang Tego Calderon Don Omar and Gail Gadot. All these old pals reunite in a grungy garage in Rio for--no seriously Vin Diesel says this line--""one last job"" a deliriously overambitious heist in which they propose to steal all the cash stowed around the city in safe houses by a Brazilian gangster (Joaquim de Almeida) who has the entire carioca police force in his pocket. How will they do it? The scheme involves train robbery stolen police cars bombs placed in toilet stalls and a chase through the streets of Rio dragging an enormous bank vault on a chain but thats not important right now. What matters is that the Fast gang is a family--one thats about to expand now that Mia is pregnant with OConners child. This theme is one Fast Five returns to again and again--Whos in the family? Whos out? Once you get kicked out of the family is there any way back in again? Advertisement The movies insistence that its motley crew of sensation-seeking gearheads is bound by a shared set of deeper values may account for Fast Fives incongruous sweetness. Yes most of this films running time consists of muscle-bound men fistfighting and leaping off corrugated tin rooftops but it still feels like a movie about a group of people who know and love one another (and whom the audience at least at the rowdy public screening I attended knows and loves as well.) Diesels Dom Toretto is a gruff but affectionate father to his loyal pack of renegades providing them with barbecue protection and a rough moral code to live by. With his authoritative basso voice and sad-eyed bearlike demeanor Diesel recalls the young Sylvester Stallone at once fearsome alpha male and loveable lug. Dwayne Johnson as Doms nemesis on the police force both looks and talks like a childs movable action figure lending the mens numerous mano-a-mano encounters a goofy Godzilla vs. King Kong quality. Justin Lin whos now directed three movies in the Fast series knows how to choreograph and edit an action sequence so that its more than an onslaught of chopped-up images and grating noise. One train chase early on is particularly exhilarating in its gleeful defiance of both plot logic and physics. Fast Five is unapologetically excited about things that go vroom-vroom as aptly spoofed in this Onion interview with the films purported 5-year-old screenwriter (""I want the cars to drive fast and then they explode""). If you can overlook the collateral casualty count racked up in the wildly excessive car-chase sequences that spirit of boyish enthusiasm can be infectious. As the summer of 2011 approaches with the speed of a souped-up Dodge Charger Im going to take my action-movie blessings where I can find them. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

STEPHEN COLE Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 29 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday May 23 2013 207PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The fifth instalment of the decade-old Fast amp; Furious film franchise is highlighted by an action scene that has stars Vin Diesel and Paul Walker driving over a cliff in a muscle car then jumping free of the vehicle into wild air five hundred yards or so above a churning South American river.And look even the heaviest mass - tank-in-a-T-shirt Diesel - travels at the same speed as the pretty lighter ones (the sports car and Walker) thrilling proof of Galileos discovery that all objects fall at the same rate. Movies Fast Five The official trailer Thats it for higher learning in Fast Five. The rest of the 131-minute car-racing film is adolescent guy date histrionics - screaming tires snappy putdowns and because were in Rio an occasional influx of bodies beautiful in Band-Aid bikinis.The movie begins in full throttle with former lawman Brian OConner (Walker) and his girl Mia (Jordana Brewster) on hot rods extracting imperturbable criminal mastermind Dom Toretto (Diesel) from a speeding prison transport van.With the law on their trail the trio takes a powder to South America where it gathers a slouching photogenic pit crew which includes Tej (Ludacris) Roman (Tyrese Gibson) Han (Sung Kang) Giselle (Gal Godot) and a pair of enterprising locals for ""one last job"" that will set them free and clear. A heist - 100-million in cold hard cash baby. And all Doms delinquents have to do is rip off the mob elude a corrupt police force and stay a few blocks ahead of a ferocious fast-pursuing U.S. federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson raining sweat like a sprinkler).""We just went from Mission Impossible to Mission Infreakingsanity"" Roman exclaims handicapping their odds for success.Doesnt matter. Dom is through hiding. ""Running aint freedom"" he explains paraphrasing Kris Kristofferson.Filmmaker Justin Lin who also directed the previous two Fast amp; Furious instalments stinkers both has finally learned that the series works best when it is most congenial. In addition to a flashy guest star (Johnson) the latest instalment has a surprisingly relaxed egalitarian feel. This is the sunniest of all Famp;Fs with at least a half-dozen sequences where the gang hug it out. Furthermore Ludacris Gibson Godot and Chang all get a scene or two to steal.That last part is a good idea because fish suspended in a winter coma are more animated than Diesel who sometimes cant be bothered hoisting his tongue to the roof of his mouth when speaking. And the perpetually juvenile Walker still looks nervous around girls. Way too callow and unassertive to be a car-racing badass.Then again these unlikely action stars are probably the reason Famp;F has grossed close to 1-billion worldwide keeping Universal Studios afloat. For any kid can imagine himself being Paul Walker. Lift some weights and drink a lot of protein shakes and he can dream of being Vin Diesel.Perhaps more important the film series imagines a world where nice boys befriend and hang out with baritone bullfrog bad guys. A world where gas and girlfriends are plentiful.

It also capitalizes on our enjoyment of fast and furious methods of transportation be they car motorcycle train or dune buggy. When you combine this fondness for the series earned over hard hours of car chases and bro-hugging youre pretty much going to lose all perspective. Fast Five delivers precisely what a film titled Fast Five should be delivering even though its too long and even though its not a stand-alone movie. What is it? An apex predator of action franchises. Vin Diesel vs. Dwayne Johnson. Weve all known it was coming since the days of Vin Diesels performance in xXx to Dwayne Johnsons take on Beck in The Rundown. Yep these two have been on a collision course since the world looked around in the early 2000s and realized our previous crop of action stars was getting old. Diesel is back as Dominic Toretto a man who puts family above all else an honorable fellow who just happens to be a criminal. Enter Dwayne Johnson as the man tasked to hunt him down. Do I even need to mention hell hunt him down ""at all costs""? You bet he will. Fast Five picks up right where Fast and Furious left off. Toretto has been sentenced to hard time no chance of parole and Paul Walker has finally decided that its to be the outlaw life for him. Adios FBI salutations government pension. Mia (Jordana Brewster) and Paul Walker (okay he plays a guy named ""Brian OConner"" but cmon we all know its Paul Walker doing Paul Walker stuff) are still a happy couple but they are on the run due to their involvement with Torettos escape. Where to run? Rio de Janiero naturally. Rio makes perfect sense because of the beautiful populace the assumed drug kingpins fast cars and the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue that no filmmaker can resist. The dialogue naturally is bristling with macho goodness. ""GO WALK IT OFF"" screams Vin Diesel shouting down Paul Walker. Dwayne Johnson tells an unsuspecting Brazilian cop to ""stay the f out of my way."" They drive a car off a cliff. Thats not dialogue but it speaks volumes about what were dealing with. Millions in property damage is considered and then executed with glee. Fast Five is an action film writ large bold and beautiful in its hard-charging simplicity. The franchise also manages to make a smooth transition away from only car chases and races toward a more Oceans Eleven style ensemble heist movie. Everyone is back Ludacris Tyrese Gibson Gal Gadot -- the only one left out was Lucas Black a man who must be wondering why his drift wasnt adequate enough for inclusion. And of course youll want to stay past the end credits if only to see a writing team paint themselves into a corner for Fast Six. All in all a very satisfying time at the movies. Its not in 3-D which at this point is almost retro in its not charging an audience extra. The cadence remains a familiar one danger followed by hugs followed by laughs followed by car chases. Like a cool beach breeze on a sunny day Fast Five provides just enough to get you in the mood for summer.

"Fast Five (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Fast Five (PG-13) The fifth installment is big loud long stupid... and fun Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com4/27/2011 Editor rating 2.5 The fifth installment of the Fast and Furious franchise is big loud long and stupid. Its leading man is a charisma-free block of muscle and its plot features holes big enough to drive a semi through (which these characters could and would do without hesitation). Its also embarrassingly fun the sort of speedy senseless violence-crammed action flick that virtually defines the summer season with superheroes who arent gods or crusaders in tights but guys in T-shirts and jeans who can drive cars really fast. Theyre criminals who break the law and yet are deeply morally sound so rooting for them is interesting without presenting any sticky ethical questions.The creators of the series changed things up a bit in Fast Five which was directed by Justin Lin who helmed Fast amp; Furious (No. 4) and Tokyo Drift (No. 3). Its morphed from a race to a heist movie -- think Oceans 11 without the glam of the Bellagio -- with a couple of excellent car chases and vicious fights and the new dimension makes the film accessible to viewers who dont know a 1970 Dodge Charger from a 2010 Toyota Prius while still providing pedal-to-the-metal thrills for original fans. When last we saw our heroes Dom (Vin Diesel) and former FBI agent Brian (Paul Walker) the latter was breaking the former out of state custody by crashing the prison-bound bus in which Dom was riding. (No one is killed though the bus flips about 40 times; innocent bystanders fare well in this movie to keep the heroes pure.) Fast Five opens with that rescue following Dom Brian and Doms sister/Brians girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster) on the lam into the shantytowns of Rio de Janeiro. Prudence suggests they should lay low. And yet theyre still tempted by the lure of Hollywoods bright and shiny cliche the ""one last job"" so that they can take the money and disappear off the radar for good.Trouble is the job goes awry (after the robbery of a moving train with a jaw-dropping ending). The trio discovers a secret hidden in one of the cars they steal and soon theyre at odds not only with a Rio crime lord (Joaquim de Almeida) but also a pumped-up federal agent (Dwayne Johnson in full raging badass mode) determined to bring them home to face justice. What else can they do but get the old gang back together and try to steal the bad guys cash while evading the law?The film is as silly as this sounds and yet somehow it works so long as you dont dwell on such questions as If these guys are so broke how can they afford an endless supply of equipment to set up the heist? Why would a pretty female agent be so easily swayed by Dom who possesses all the charm of an engine block? Why is Johnson glistening like hes just greased up for a wrestling match? Fortunately the action is well choreographed and intense enough to take your mind off such musings. Bringing back familiar characters from the earlier movies also proves inspired. A mostly funny supporting cast which includes Tyrese as the groups dynamic sweet talker and rapper Ludacris as a guy who just wants enough money to open a garage distracts you from the hilarity of scenes that require Diesel to exhibit emotion.This franchise has primarily been aimed at young male viewers but the screenwriters have also apparently wised up to the fact that this audience brings girlfriends to the movies and so a family-oriented theme runs throughout. The fact that that bit of manipulation works too -- along with a teaser ending setting up a Fast Six -- indicates this franchise has no plans ever to slow down.

"Fast Five preview Vin Diesel and friends are back in fifth film in the Fast and Furious series |       NJ.com comments Fast Five preview Vin Diesel and friends are back in fifth film in the Fast and Furious series Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 29 2011 at 835 AM View/Post Comments Jaimie Trueblood Vin Diesel right reprises his role as a car thief in ""Fast Five"" the latest movie in the Fast and Furious series. Brian OConner (right) plays Paul Walker Fast Five"" not only stars Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson it puts them in a massive fistfight. It fills its Imax screen with big guns male bonding muscle cars stuff getting broken things blowing up cold beer and sweat. If there were any more testosterone here Jose Canseco could have boiled down the screen and injected it. If thats all youre looking for -- two hours of slugfests and squealing tires -- well ""Fast Five"" reliably delivers. You may feel a little stupider -- and slightly deafened -- after watching it but you wont feel as if you had your pocket picked. This is as the title is awkwardly meant to inform us the fifth film in the franchise. If youre keeping a timeline though its actually the fourth story chronologically coming right before ""Tokyo Drift."" And if you are keeping a timeline of the ""Fast and Furious"" series -- well you need to get out more. Seriously. Anyway the setup here has master car thief Diesel cop-gone-crook Paul Walker and Walkers love (and Diesels sis) Jordana Brewster on the run in Rio. Where Diesel says its time for ""one last job -- then we disappear forever."" Movie Review FAST FIVE (PG-13) Universal (122 min.) Directed by Justin Lin. With Vin Diesel Paul Walker Jordana Brewster. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains constant violence and some barely there bikinis. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS Yeah right. We know how easily that little plan always works out in the movies. Of course these characters are criminals which means the script has to get awfully cute pretending not to endorse their behavior. So they only steal from other worse criminals -- and all the cops chasing them are corrupt and therefore no better than they are. The one exception being Johnson a federal agent determined to bring them down. Johnson is even more of a cartoon than usual made up with so much bronzer and manly moisture he looks like a side of barbecued ribs. (Still hes Sir Ian McKellen next to the low-grade Diesel who isnt so much phoning in his performance as sending it by carrier pigeon.) But if you buy a ticket to one of these movies its not to admire the performances (although supporting players Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris contribute some nice low-key humor). Its to see the cars and marvel at the car chases. Director Justin Lin who made two of the other films in the series puts both on display. Lins not good with physical action (when Diesel and Johnson finally square off its such a blur of closeups you cant tell the bald heads from the biceps). But the cars are lit with far more love than the actresses and the chases are done with care. Whats here beyond that? Not much. But the chase scenes are great. The four-wheeled stars are all shown off to advantage. And while you dont want to wish criminals a happy retirement if Diesel and company really do disappear after this one last job -- well that would be just fine.

Starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Jordana Brewster Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Tyrese Gibson Sung Kang Gal Gadot Matt Schulze Tego Calderon Don Omar Director Justin Lin Running time 210 Release Opened Apr 29 2011  Editorial Review Race down memory lane again By Sean OConnell Wednesday April 27 2011 Quick Name a Hollywood franchise that has produced its finest installment on the fifth try. Its tough to do right? Everything from ""Harry Potter"" to ""Police Academy"" tends to peter out after two or three films. But the burly brawny ""Fast Five"" bucks the trend. By shifting into a previously untapped gear it delivers the most entertaining ""Fast and Furious"" adventure while also getting 2011s summer movie season off on the right lead foot. Lets not get too carried away though. This remains a ""Fast"" film and likely wont win over new converts to the 10-year-old franchise. But the reason this series has survived for a decade is because it respects its target audience caters to their adrenalized needs and rarely tries to be something it isnt. This is a souped-up soap opera. Its ""Guiding Light"" for guys. Chris Morgans script trots out melodramatic plot twists that are the norm on daytime television unplanned pregnancies; betrayals orchestrated by close teammates; a presumed-dead character returning from the grave. But as long as cars are racing metal is crunching and bikinis are hugging female curves die-hard ""Fast"" fans either wont notice or simply wont let it spoil their fun. Aside from its wayward third installment the ""Fast"" series has followed the dangerous exploits of monotone street racer Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian OConner (Paul Walker) the ex-cop who gradually became Doms high-flying partner in crime. The duos latest impossible mission takes place in and around Rio de Janeiros congested favelas where Torettos crew uses vital information stored on a stolen microchip to rob a sadistic drug kingpin (oily Joaquim de Almeida) all while avoiding Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) the road-raging federal bounty hunter ordered to bring these fugitives to justice. That may sound like too much plot but director Justin Lin helming his third consecutive ""Fast"" film has become adept at steering this continuing story around major plot holes as we race toward the next muscular action sequence. Morgan may have constructed a durable heist at the heart of ""Fast Five"" but its Lins elaborately planned and eye-popping automobile stunts -- which avoid artificial-looking CGI whenever possible -- that butter this movies bread. Characters dangle from the hoods of trucks as they are driven into rapidly moving trains. A footrace across Brazils rooftops looks like a large-scale game of Tetris. And the films final chase scene which demolishes most of downtown Rio as two cars drag a multiton safe will make Michael Bay drool with envy. Just about every actor previously involved with a ""Fast"" film returns so Lin finds a place for cocky Roman (Tyrese Gibson) tech-savvy Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and mainstay Mia (Jordana Brewster) who has provided eye candy since the first ""Fast"" in 2001. Johnson -- who Ill always consider to be The Rock despite his name change -- is the films notable newcomer yet he plugs so effortlessly into the franchises brash vibe you have to wonder why it took so long for him to be included. His relentless agent is an ideal foil to Diesels arrogant crook and when they clash in a no-holds-barred fistfight the audience will understand how teenage girls felt when they finally saw Bella kiss Edward in ""Twilight."" To borrow a culinary analogy Rock is chocolate to the ""Five"" series peanut butter. Now that Ive tasted the two flavors together I cant ever imagine them being apart and am excited that Rock appears to be sticking around for future installments. Oh there will be more ""Fast"" films. Stick around through the ""Fast Five"" credits to learn where the storys heading next. Producers have suggested in recent interviews that the sixth ""Fast"" is likely to be the last but I dont believe them for a second. Once that aforementioned baby is born he or she will be groomed to assume the lead role in ""Fast"" parts nine through 12. By then I can only assume Walker and Diesel will be infiltrating NASA so they can hijack rockets in outer space. Contains intense sequences of violence and action sexual content and language.

Photo (c)Universal Jordana Brewster ((c)Universal) Not to nitpick but theres a teensy little flaw in ""Fast Five"" -- until the finale it has no car chases to speak of. Instead of a vroomer we get a knucklehead ""Oceans 11."" After endless scenes of poring over blueprints and analyzing security cameras at a police station whose vault holds (exactly?) 100 million the boys just ram through a wall with a giant Hummer and drag the safe away with fast cars. Dom (Vin Diesel) was sentenced to 25 years in prison at the end of the (vastly better) fourth film two years ago. Brian (Paul Walker) the FBI-agent boyfriend of his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) busted him loose and now all three are on the run in Rio. There a car-theft deal goes bad three DEA agents get killed and our heroes are targeted by both the DEA and Reyes the gangster who runs the favelas. Dwayne Johnson comes aboard to play the chief lawman one of those bad hombres whose toughness is mainly illustrated by how colorfully he tells others to do their jobs. ""If he goes to the john I wanna know how many times he shakes it"" he barks at his info squad. You may not hear what hes saying though Its easy to be distracted by the glare from Johnsons spit-shined arms. Does he butter himself between takes? Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) is an unforgivably dull villain who gets little screen time. Supposedly he owns the ghetto favelas and he puts a bounty on the heads of Dom and friends yet nothing comes of this even as the lads openly strut around town. Instead of a scene that makes us hate Reyes there are many given to rounding up the crew (including Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson who filled in on the second film; Sung Kang whose character Han is supposed to be dead; and Tego Calderon and Don Omar as a superfluous pair of bitchy sidekicks). Many more scenes are wasted on casing the police station where Reyes stashes his money. You dont need stolen police cars if youre going to do a smash and grab. Not counting the reprise of ""Fast"" Fours prison-bus escape at the start and a bit in which cars are driven off a moving train (and the two leads jump off a bridge the height of the GW without injury) the first car chase comes nearly 80 minutes in -- when the boys race a quarter of a mile on a straightaway. Somehow this takes about a minute indicating that they cant be going much faster than skateboards. One-liners tend to the meaningless ""Make sure you got your thunderwear on"" sounds like something youd say in a nursing home. And if youre wondering why this movie must stretch past two hours its because it takes that long to read every item in the cliche dictionary. ""Were gonna do one last job"" comes up and ""Now its personal"" and ""Its a suicide mission."" The big hope is for a slap-em-up between Diesel and the Rock and when both their heads are on-screen at the same time youll see why they had to film the movie in IMAX. Yet in their first mano a mano nothing happens except some glaring with their noses an inch apart which you may read as either suspenseful or romantic. In their second encounter by which time youre expecting the greatest manbrawl since Hugh Grant took on Colin Firth in ""Bridget Joness Diary"" all we get is a routine tussle. They punch they tackle they roar. Each mans head gets smashed into the wall and you can almost hear the concrete go ""Ouch."" kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Mad Men star January Jones expecting first child but da...

Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 29 2011 1201 a.m. ET If ""Fast Five"" had been rated by the EPA instead of the MPAA--the Motion Picture Association of America gave it a PG notwithstanding rampant road rage--the average MPG would have been abysmal what with vroom-vrooming muscle cars screeching exotics and an armor-plated monster that makes the Hummer look demure. Yet this fifth edition of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise gets lots of mileage from a combination of high spirits scorn for the laws of physics readily renewable energy and an emphasis on family values--not those of the nuclear family but of hell-raising drag-racing outlaws who genuinely care for one another. ENLARGE Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in Fast Five. Universal Studios When the series made its debut in 2001 I called it ""top-drawer trash that knows its place--on thousands of multiplex screens where it will be holding young audiences enthralled for weeks to come."" That proved to be true but subsequent installments dropped to ever lower drawers which makes it all the more surprising that the franchise has renewed its lease on life. This time the plot involves an elaborate heist in Rio de Janeiro where Vin Diesels Dominic Toretto and his crew either travel the citys streets at insane speeds or make preposterous leaps of faith across favela rooftops while being chased by a phalanx of U.S. federal cops under the command of Dwayne Johnsons bemuscled and bemineral-oiled Hobbs. (Every once in a while the director Justin Lin inserts a helicopter shot of Rios landmark Christ the Redeemer statue to underscore the storys gravitas.) Someone describes Hobbs as ""Old Testament--guns bullets wrath of God."" Thats one way of putting it. Another way is Old School--unsmiling monosyllabic The Rock in Early Terminator mode. Mr. Johnson once a superstar of professional wrestling hides his usual charm--at least for a while--under the bushel of a single-minded character a lawman determined to capture his quarry at any cost. Hobbs becomes a worthy antagonist to Dominic and a great asset to the film although a face-off between the two men is photographed oddly--they seem to be looking past each other like bull mastiffs keeping sight of their offstage trainers--and a subsequent fight to the almost finish is much less interesting because its much more familiar than the climactic spectacle of cars and trucks chasing a pair of cars that happen to be dragging a room-size bank vault. ""Fast Five"" starts with a train robbery that sets a new standard for implausibility then tops it by using the vault and the cables dragging it as a giant sling that lays waste to whatever happens to be in its way. The overlong sequence is coarsely conceived and devoid of physical logic--its as if digital technology which makes everything possible though not necessarily plausible had been used to expunge any remaining cultural memory of the elegantly constructed movie chases pioneered by Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. Still geniality carries the day. Its the additive that boosts everyones octane. Cave of Forgotten Dreams Werner Herzog is the Robert Burton of contemporary filmmaking. Like the 17th-century author of ""The Anatomy of Melancholy"" which was anything but melancholic Mr. Herzog seems to be intrigued by every aspect of being human and has turned out a remarkably long string of intriguing films that include ""Grizzly Man"" ""Aguirre The Wrath of God"" and back in 1974 a wonderful documentary with an off-putting title ""The Great Ecstasy of the Sculptor Steiner."" Now he has gone to the south of France to investigate--in 3-D yet--the Chauvet cave where Paleolithic artists covered the walls with paintings of animals some 30000 years ago. They are the oldest known cave paintings and theyre astonishing for the beauty and economy of their style--surging lines that summon up the dynamic essence of the rhinos lions bisons bears leopards ibex and wolves that filled the forests of the epoch. Speaking of the art that followed unto our day the filmmaker-narrator says ""It never got better"" and he indulges his penchant for endearing grandiosity by declaring ""It is as if the modern human soul erupted here."" (He also takes a swipe at Picasso an overrated painter in his book and offers a chillingly fanciful critique of nuclear power that involves mutant albino crocodiles.) But were the Chauvet paintings really the product of artists consciously making what we now consider art? Thats impossible to know of course and the unknowable or the mysteriously ambiguous in human behavior is what sets Mr. Herzogs synapses to firing with singular intensity. No one lived in these caves he notes; they were kept for painting and possibly for ceremonies. He tries to imagine the painters imaginings ""across this abyss of time."" He wonders if they dreamed if they cried at night. And he illustrates Platos Allegory of the Cave by way of Fred Astaire dancing with his shadows in ""Bojangles of Harlem"" the glorious tribute--now considered politically incorrect--to Bill Robinson in ""Swing Time."" Another question one thats easier to answer Why use 3-D cameras to shoot 2-D paintings? Because the paintings are flat but the cave walls arent. They curve and bulge voluptuously and the artists or whatever one chooses to call them used the contours to lend depth to the paintings. The vast caves stalactites and stalagmites are a spectacle too. Go underground with magic glasses on your nose and you wont regret it. ENLARGE Yusuke Iseya and Takayuki Yamada in 13 Assassins. Magnet Releasing A group of assassins come together for a suicide mission to kill an evil lord. 13 Assassins Right makes might in Takashi Miikes excellent--and exceedingly violent--remake of a 1966 Japanese classic by Eiichi Kudo. (The movie is also in the debt of another classic Akira Kurosawas ""Seven Samurai."") In the waning years of the samurai era 13 rusty warriors-for-hire--two more than in Kudos original--take on hundreds of soldiers in the course of a suicide mission to kill Lord Naritsugu (Goro Inagaki) the evil half-brother of a ruling shogun. Naritsugu isnt just a villain but a sadist; he lops the limbs off innocent victims with great delight and an unshakable conviction that ""punishment is a masters duty."" And ""13 Assassins"" isnt just an action adventure with horror credentials but a study in criminal pathology. Preparations for the mission go rather slowly since the group must be selected man by man in the consecrated style of ""Oceans 11."" Nine assassins might have done nicely or Kurosawas seven but the build-up is sustained by the movies seriousness of purpose--its about the blind devotion that tyrants can inspire--and the engaging heroism of the groups leader Shinzaemon (Koji Yakusho). When asked to take on the mission by the shoguns senior adviser Shinzaemon says ""I will accomplish your wish with magnificence."" As things turn out thats no idle promise. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS Bullitt (1968) Car chases have come a long way since Steve McQueens cop in a spunky little Mustang coupe pursued a couple of bad guys in a hulking Dodge Charger up and down the streets of San Francisco. This seminal chase put a premium on finesse. Both drivers tried to avoid banging into things and mostly succeeded. At one point McQueen even stopped to make sure a downed motorcyclist was unhurt. Peter Yates directed from a screenplay by Alan Trustman and Harry Kleiner. The cast includes Jacqueline Bisset Robert Vaughn and Robert Duvall. Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans (2009) Rather than a conventional remake Werner Herzogs film is a whole new take on the 1992 cult classic ""Bad Lieutenant"" which was written and directed by Abel Ferrara. The original production is remarkable for Harvey Keitels performance as a corrupt and brutal cop in search of redemption; otherwise its punishingly grim. If the remake with Nicolas Cage as a rogue cop named Terence McDonagh commits the sin of entertainment its redeemed by a sense of lifes contradictions and distinguished by surreal flourishes that include a pair of iguanas slithery witnesses to Terences mania. Kiss of Death (1947) Richard Widmark won an Oscar nomination for his debut performance as Tommy Udo a peerless sadist who has a special way with wheelchairs. Dont confuse this with the inferior remake of the same name that stars Nicolas Cage in the Tommy Udo role (except that Tommy is called Little Junior Brown) and David Caruso as Jimmy Kilmartin who follows in the footsteps of Victor Matures Nick Bianco an ex-con trying to go straight. The original is classic film noir and Mr. Widmarks thug is the essence of cool. Henry Hathaway directed from a screenplay by Ben Hecht and Charles Lederer.

"Fast Five | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fast-five ) Fast Five (United States 2011) April 28 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ever since Justin Lin took control of The Fast and the Furious franchise with installment 3 he has pushed things in new and sometimes daring directions. With Fast Five he not only melds balls-to-the-wall comic book action with heist movie dynamics but divorces things completely from reality. Admittedly the other four Fast/Furious films had as little respect for the laws of physics as they did for the laws of man but Fast Five elects to ignore them altogether. Combining that with the violence limitations imposed by the PG-13 rating death is about as likely as a graphic sex scene. The summer movie season of 2011 has arrived in much the same manner as many summer movie seasons with a blaze of moronic action. No one can fault Fast Five for not pumping up the testosterone level but the previously mentioned disregard for even the most basic realizations of Sir Isaac limit the potential excitement of some of the high octane sequences. Ignoring the rules of physics doesnt make a movie more entertaining; it merely makes the writing easier. If a screenplay can cheat at any time it encourages sloppy authorship. Fast Five opens an undetermined time after the fourth installment. The opening sequence is shorter than the one in its predecessor as Brian (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster) organize a jailbreak for Dominic (Vin Diesel) who is being taken to prison in a bus. A little fancy driving is all thats necessary to flip the bus and spring the criminal. For their efforts Brian and Mia get their own ""Wanted"" posters and have to hide out in Rio although at no point are they shown to be looking for talking animated birds. Instead their goal is somewhat bigger the 100 million cash stockpile of a drug kingpin (Joaquim de Almedia). To accomplish that theft the intrepid trio must assemble a team - a dirty dozen of sorts. However not only are Dominic Brian and Mia at war with the Brazilian drug lord they are being hunted by an elite United States special agent named Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) whose methods are charitably referred to as ""wrath of God"" stuff. Back in the 80s action picture fans never got the pairing they were hoping for (primarily because finances and egos got in the way) a movie featuring Stallone and Schwarzenegger. When Schwarzenegger stepped out of the action spotlight before entering politics much was made of who would wear the mantle of his successor. Vin Diesel was an early contender. Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. ""The Rock"" was another - in fact in 2003s The Rundown Schwarzenegger jokingly passed the baton to Johnson. Over the years neither Diesel nor Johnson has proven able to rise to the level achieved by Schwarzenegger or Stallone (or for that matter Bruce Willis). In fact the biggest action star of the past ten years is arguably Matt Damon. Nevertheless action fans will probably get as much of a thrill seeing the two would-be Schwarzenegger successors go at it one-on-one as they did watching the real one finally sharing the screen with Stallone in The Expendables. The scene in which Diesel and the Rock thump and pummel one another is among Fast Fives highlights. The focus has shifted from cars to burglary. There are still plenty of chases and stunts involving high powered vehicles but Fast Five is more about the heist than it is about racing. One can make a case that this movie has a closer kinship to The Italian Job and Oceans Eleven than The Fast and the Furious. The characters are the same but their purpose has shifted. As is almost always true of a heist film the most enjoyable elements relate to the plotting rehearsing and execution of the caper. Those aspects of Fast Five are workmanlike. The over-the-top action sequence ""icing"" feels like it belongs in another production. Its a lazy way to broaden the audience avoid disillusioning fans of the franchise and provide clips for the trailer. Are we supposed to be snickering at the impossibility of the climax with two souped-up cars dragging a massive safe behind them through city streets? Is Lin going for an adrenaline rush a laugh or both? The sequence is too long to be funny and too silly to generate tension. Although Fast Five tells a complete story theres no mistaking the promise of a sixth movie at the conclusion. And speaking of endings there are more of those than in The Return of the King as every surviving character is given an epilogue. While Fast Five isnt as long as the fantasy epic its at least 30 minutes longer than it needs to be. Perhaps with Fast Six the metamorphosis begun here will be complete and something interesting will emerge from the chrysalis. For what it is Fast Five is passably entertaining although the obligatory qualifier about it being ""mindless"" must be appended. Why one wonders are so many summer movies handicapped by that adjective? Whatever the reason Fast Five satisfies on a visual and visceral level while leaving the intellectual one cold and shriveled and starving. At least its not pretentious.

In this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Dwayne Johnson is shown in a scene from ""Fast Five."" Photo Jaimie Trueblood AP Fast Five review Get your motor running 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Fast Five Action. Starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson. Directed by Justin Lin. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Ten years and a number of entries later ""Fast Five"" is the first sequel to the 2001 ""The Fast and the Furious"" thats worth watching that isnt an embarrassment or a travesty of the original picture. Director Justin Lin who directed two previous sequels is still not the director that Rob Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") is and he still doesnt know quite what to do with Vin Diesel. This is an action star of mythic dimension an actor who can take an audience anywhere and half the time Lin lets him look like just another nice middle-aged bald guy. But at least this time Lin tries things. He has discovered for example that its always smart to give Diesel the last word in every scene to shoot him in close-up with lots of sound-track support even if his line is something like ""We need to get some fresh air."" No matter. With Diesel growling and insinuating the words in his bass voice anything he says will seem important. Lin has also found the tone that eluded him in ""The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift"" and ""Fast amp; Furious."" He has finally made the transition from stupid to gloriously stupid which is all-important in action movies. ""Stupid"" is when a movie offers something ridiculous but takes it seriously - and expects you to take it seriously. ""Gloriously Stupid"" is when a movie offers you something ridiculous and knows its ridiculous - but then promises to go way beyond ridiculous and surprise you with how insane and grandly ridiculous a movie can be while keeping a straight face. ""Fast Five"" does exactly that. Related Stories Fast Five The gloriousness begins two minutes in. Dominic (Vin Diesel) a street racer of genius is sentenced to 25 years in federal prison - but no dont be sad because hell never get there. His sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and his buddy Brian devise a subtle scheme for taking over the prison bus - by forcing it to skid off the road and flip over a half-dozen times at high speed. Why didnt they just blow it up? Then just a few minutes later theyre all in Brazil robbing race cars from a moving train in a sequence thats laughable until you find yourself leaning forward in your seat with your jaw in your lap. Beautiful action choreography for that one. In ""Fast Five"" Dominic Mia and Brian are outlaws. They cant go home and they cant earn a legitimate living in Brazil so they have no economic option but crime. Meanwhile an FBI agent is on the trail not some regular FBI agent but the best there is - the toughest the meanest the most relentless and driven who is even bigger badder and balder than Diesel Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. the Rock. But if Dominic Mia and Brian are to be criminals they have to be virtuous ones and so Chris Morgan in his screenplay comes up with one good idea They decide to rob a very bad guy the most corrupt man in Brazil who exploits the poor and has the police in his pocket. Dominics idea is to do one big score and then go off somewhere to relax. (After all theres nothing more relaxing than looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life knowing youve ripped off a mobster.) So they put together the ultimate team to pull off the heist of the century. ""Fast Five"" is not a movie for morons - its not even a movie about morons though at times one wonders. (At one point the gang steals six police cars and instead of getting them garaged as quickly as possible they race them through the streets of Rio.) Rather its a movie for audiences who think exuberance in movies is more important than sense or logic and who can laugh at a movie and like it at the same time. -- Advisory Violence.

By GARY DOWELL Special Contributor Published 28 April 2011 0352 PM Updated 29 April 2011 0959 AM Related GuideLive.com Fast Five Everything old continues to be new again with the Fast and the Furious franchise being the latest dredged-up and reinvented. With Fast Five the series takes the curious surprising and rather brave route of ditching the street-racing shenanigans that defined the series in favor of a more standard action-oriented plot. Its an interesting approach but the series shallowness remains.The movie begins right where the fourth installment left off with a pre-title sequence that has on-again off-again cop Brian OConner (Paul Walker) rescuing street-racing thief Dominic Torreto (Vin Diesel) from a prison bus. It then jumps to Brazil where Dom and Brian are betrayed during the heist of three DEA-impounded sports cars from a moving train. They assemble a team of past franchise co-stars to assist them in stealing 100 million from the powerful drug kingpin (Joaquim de Almeida) who double-crossed them while being pursued by hard-nosed federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson).The shift in gears from gratuitous Miami Vice rehash to gratuitous Michael Bay-esque heist flick is a shrewd one as is the move of creating a dream team of cast members from every previous entry in the series. This chapter plays like Oceans Eleven meets The Italian Job (the original and the remake respectively). It covers the gamut of action sequences from shootouts to punch-ups to car chases and stuff getting blown up though the change in focus doesnt elevate it above mediocre sequel status. Fast Five almost seems ashamed of its roots going so far as to skip over a street-race scene in which the team wins some faster sets of wheels.There is however a certain guilty pleasure that comes from watching a frighteningly pumped-up Johnson literally and figuratively tower over the rest of the cast. A talented actor whos waded through worse than this and survived intact Johnson oozes so much confidence and machismo that one almost expects Diesel to burst into flames during the inevitable stare-down scene. Johnson more than makes up for the lack of onscreen charisma from Diesel and Walker.At 130 minutes the movies also unjustifiably long with a lot of tedium between bombastic but inventive action sequences (of which the obligatory punch-up between Johnson and Diesel is the best). As a guilty pleasure the sequences work but lets face it Nobody expects introspection or emotional depth from this series and the attempts here seem woefully misguided. A teaser scene inserted into the closing credits promises yet another entry in the series but one cant help wonder if theres anywhere left for it to go or even enough gas in the tank to get it there.Fast FiveC- Starring Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne Johnson Jordana Brewster Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges and Sung Kang.

"Twists turns come at a furious pace in Fast Five - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Twists turns come at a furious pace in Fast Five By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Blame it on Rio. By Jaimie Trueblood Universal Studios Paul Walker left Tyrese Gibson and Vin Diesel burn up the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the fifth installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. EnlargeClose By Jaimie Trueblood Universal Studios Paul Walker left Tyrese Gibson and Vin Diesel burn up the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the fifth installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The exotic setting adds major horsepower to this absurdly entertaining high-octane fifth go-round. Who knew the fourth sequel to The Fast and the Furious would not only refuel a flagging franchise but lead the pack as the best of the bunch? VIDEO Watch the trailer This time around disgraced FBI agent Brian OConner (Paul Walker) and his girlfriend Mia Toretto (Jordana Brewster) have sprung her hulking brother Dom (Vin Diesel) from the slammer. Since then theyve been on the run. Initially they blend in with the comely locals in Rio de Janeiro. Then theyre cornered. Dom comes up with a plan to steal from Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) Rios most corrupt businessman. Soon Dom and Brian are calling in an array of their former Fast associates. The decision to take a sharp turn from the street-racing arena and cruise into Oceans Eleven turf is wise. After helming the last two films director Justin Lin hits his stride here giving the series a powerful overhaul. Earlier movies in the franchise were feeling the mileage. Souped-up cars can take you only so far. The engine that fuels this caper involves millions in heist dollars and the likable ensemble jumps on board. Wisecracks are not as fast and furious as they could be but repartee between Tego Calderon Don Omar and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges is amiable funny and without pretension. About the movie Fast Five   out of fourStars Vin Diesel Paul Walker Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Jordana Brewster Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Tyrese Gibson Director Justin LinDistributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequence of violence and action sexual content and language. Running time 2 hours10 minutes Opens Friday nationwide A few initial scenes in Rios crowded slums race by in a blur. But when Brian and Dom steal a car from a moving train and then take a harrowing leap Butch Cassidy style into a rushing river its impossible not to be immersed. Never mind the irresponsible mayhem and casualties on the exploding train. Repercussions dont exist in any meaningful way in this outlandish universe. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as federal agent Hobbs brings a hefty dose of muscle along for the ride. Hes after Dom and Brian. Theres a brutal dogfight between Johnson and Diesel from which both emerge swagger intact and without the tiniest scratch. And during one perilous chase Dom Brian and Mia skid around in a vehicle so protectively armored it makes a Hummer look like a Smart Car. The Brazilian megalopolis is an inspired choice for the setting given Rios ascendancy as the site of both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. Audiences also can see Rio in all its glory on IMAX screens. Sure this adheres to the ""one last job"" scenario done countless times. Details are implausible even sloppy. But the plot is like a sidecar in a spectacular fleet with propulsive style. Inventive action sequences deft stunt work and breathtaking cinematography make for revved-up fun.

"Fast Five Movie review - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie Review Fast Five Fast Five Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Pictures Dwayne Johnson right and Vin Diesel in ""Fast Five."" Dwayne Johnson right and Vin Diesel in ""Fast Five."" (Jaimie Trueblood / Universal Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Who knew that the best place to put Vin Diesel would be between the Rock and a hard place? The spot has never been tighter or righter and the testosterone never higher than in the hot jacking action of ""Fast Five.""Going mano a mano with Diesels Dom the ex-con street-racing Robin Hood is Dwayne Johnsons agent Hobbs. Hes come down to Rio de Janeiro where the fifth (and best) edition of ""The Fast and the Furious"" zoom-zoom takes place to settle some scores. (Memo to Johnson if you really want to stop the ""Rock"" references to your former wrestling self then dont put on 30 pounds of muscle and oil up so the sun reflects off the biceps -- not complaining just saying.) In Doms corner is most of his old pit crew anchored by Paul Walkers ex-undercover cop now officially hooked up with Doms sister (Jordana Brewster) because nothing cements a relationship like breaking a prospective brother-in-law out of jail (see No. 4 for more).Director Justin Lin whos been in the drivers seat since No. 3 2006s ""Tokyo Drift"" kicks things off with a brazen bit of business that involves a speeding train luxe cars in need of stealing federal agents dying a bridge looming and characters actually talking. If Im not mistaken Doms expanded his cache of expressions from miffed mad and amused to include thoughtful sentimental and one that is either bliss or bleary depending on the camera angle. In addition to nearly every actor whos ever taken the ""Fast"" ride most of the core creative team is back as well including screenwriter Chris Morgan for his third go. He and Lin have shifted the story away from the confines of the underground street-racing culture and turned ""Fast Five"" into a heist movie though not a typical one (in those the bad guys tend to keep things on the down low).Its a complicated setup. Things didnt go as planned on the speeding train and now Rios slick drug kingpin (Joaquim de Almeida) and his thugs are after Dom and crew. Doms not happy either and is planning a sting to steal the kingpins money. Meanwhile Hobbs has amassed an army to bring in Dom and friends for those agents deaths. Hobbs conscripts local hot cop Elena (Elsa Pataky) because -- road rules -- there can never be too many pretty girls or too many cars (started with 300 lost 200 along the way) and now major firepowers been tacked onto the list.Lin makes sure the humor isnt lost either with even the sound of guns locking and loading behind every door on one dicey street a very funny bit. As always the pacing is a strange mix. When things are simmering -- the kingpin ordering killings Dom making up elaborate schemes -- everybody just hangs loose grabs a beer barbecues ribs. Then suddenly its pedal to the metal time.Rio works well as a backdrop for all that -- a footrace across rooftops and down alleyways of a hillside shantytown is one of the most visually riveting action sequences in recent memory. The locale is also a good excuse to put about half the dialogue in Portuguese with English subtitles -- no doubt a show of respect to the series many international fans. Tucked inside all the running and gunning are a lot of heart-to-hearts about fatherhood brotherhood family loyalty and love in the talkiest ""Fast"" yet. The best moments though belong to the Diesel and Dwayne face-offs. Although the Rock looms larger slug for slug they are pretty evenly matched and fights usually end in a tie. Unlike the loooooong car chases -- the finale would be better cut by half; in fact the movie which clocks in at two-plus hours should have been ""faster"" too -- the boys battles are bloody efficient.Though aesthetics have never really concerned ""Furious"" filmmakers -- I dont think theyre going for an Oscar -- the sheer audacity of ""Fast Five"" is kind of breathtaking in a metal-twisting death-defying mission-implausible B-movie-on-steroids kind of way.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Despite shedding two definite articles and replacing ""and"" with an ampersand 2009s Fast amp; Furious the third sequel in the improbable Fast And The Furious series was far from the model of sleek economy its title suggested. Due to Vin Diesels on-and-off involvement and an ever-increasing cast of characters a franchise built on the simple thrills of fast cars and hot bodies had taken on weight--a word like ""mythology"" should never have to applied to material this frivolous. By bringing back virtually all the major characters from the previous films and adding another block of concrete in Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Fast Five would seem to exacerbate the problem but it does the opposite. Like a proper action sequel its bigger louder and sillier than its predecessors but its more streamlined too smartly dumping the tired underground racing angle in favor of a crisp hugely satisfying Oceans Eleven-style heist movie. After two sequences that top each other for giddy large-scale ridiculousness--one a prison-bus breakout the other an audacious attempt to boost cars from a moving train--Fast Five takes up permanent residence in Rio where former adversaries turned outlaw buddies Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are hiding out. After discovering the location of 10 cash houses operated by Rios top criminal mastermind Diesel and Walker decide to pull an audacious raid for all the money totaling over 100 million. They assemble a team of familiar rogues for the job--Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Sung Kang Gal Gadot and several others--but a crazy mission gets crazier when Johnson a relentless federal agent vows to hunt them down. Ripping off Rios chief power broker while simultaneously dodging the feds turns out to be much more unlikely than stealing three Las Vegas casinos worth of cash from an underground vault but Fast Five makes an asset of its own absurdity. At 130 minutes its the longest of the series but director Justin Lin and his screenwriter Chris Morgan keep turning out larger and more outrageous setpieces until a finale of epic destruction. Fast Five may be lizard-brain escapism--and theres something unsettling about how it lays waste to Rios desperately poor favelas--but nonsense this well-orchestrated is a rare and precious thing.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In ""Fast Five just about everybody from ""Fast and Furious installments one through four drops in on Rio de Janeiro to steal some cars take down a dirty local tycoon and obliterate everything possible. The choicest objet de rampage is a 4-ton vault cabled to two cars containing what Im sure Universal Pictures hopes will be the movies worldwide opening-weekend haul. As it swings through a bank plows through car after car after car (speeding parked whatever) and sends extras running for their lives its a weapon of crass destruction. Which means ""Fast Five is so far the most honest Hollywood movie of the year. Its also the most fun.No longer is the series a collection of GPS-navigation dialogue robots disguised as actors and video-game-worthy action -- well not only is it that. Narratively this is one of Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans films strapped to the hood of something in a Michael Bay demolition derby. With Soderberghs movies the interest in paydays is classed up with movie stars and sleek style while Bay expresses a fascination with money by spending it on computer-generated toys. For a rambunctious stretch of ""Fast Five the cash is the entertainment. The movie beats you over the head with money even as it takes it from your wallet and the lack of shame as loathsome as some might find it is refreshing for the brutal blatancy of crashing poetry into literalism Money destroys everything.What began as a franchise of road-race extravaganzas is now for the moment a heist series one with a climax that unfortunately evokes recent weather-related disasters. Still the category switch is as exciting as the stunt work here. ""Fast Five jumps from the hurtling wreckage of its previous genre onto the cab of another at about 150 miles per hour -- not unlike what Paul Walker does twice in one early scene.Walkers turncoat FBI agent Brian OConner and his car-thief pal Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) are now wanted for stealing seized DEA cars from a Brazilian train and killing government agents. They did steal the car but didnt shoot the agents which allows the movie to demonstrate that it knows wrong from wronger. Brians lady (Jordana Brewster) is also Doms sister and shes pregnant which means she wants to stop running. So a last job is required as is ye olde ragtag specialist team. Thats a welcome development since it brings back the series more charismatic players -- Tyrese Gibson Chris ""Ludacris Bridges Sung Kang Tego Calderon Don Omar and the slinky Israeli Gal Gadot -- to water this personality desert. The object of that sub-""Oceans scheming is to rob a vicious businessman played by Joaquim de Almeida whos really known no other role. To bring Dom and Brian in the movie introduces Diplomatic Security Service Agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and his team of men with tight shirts and large arms -- though no shirt is tighter and no arm larger than Johnsons. Its never explained why his head stays beaded with an unspecified liquid or why his goatee is always soaking wet but my guess is that hes leaking testosterone. The rest of him glistens as if in between the many shootouts and foot chases hes competing in a Marvel Comics posedown against the Incredible Hulk and the Mighty Thor.It turns out that having Diesel and Johnson in the same movie is shrewd casting. Its something you dont notice until Diesels mumble and Johnsons swagger are happening to you at once. Time is taken in putting them face to face -- long enough to think the suspense is not unlike waiting for Al Pacino to meet Robert De Niro in ""Heat long enough to think even fleetingly that Diesel and Johnson are the Pacino and De Niro of absurdly muscled totally bald racially mixed action heroes.During one outrageous chase through and atop the favelas Diesel leaps from one rooftop to another. On his way down he turns around and sees Johnson blast himself through a window. Diesels look of awe is as comical as it is appropriate. They later share a dance in which they take turns throwing each other out of windows and through walls. As is par for the course in a ""Fast and Furious movie the only persuasive physical intimacy is between the men.The previous film from 2009 was mostly drudgery. After Michelle Rodriguez was eliminated in the opening sequence there was barely a reason to remain seated. The challenge for the director Justin Lin and the screenwriter Chris Morgan whove handled the last three episodes is to show us something new. So while this is another American blockbuster that rudely treats Latin America as a playground for Hollywood stunt teams I appreciate Lins modicum of applied skill to capture the mayhem and enunciate the ridiculousness. For one portion of that rooftop chase he tries a long shot of about a half-dozen people running along different roofs. Its like a frame of barrel-jumping in Donkey Kong. Although the challenge for most makers of action movies is now the orchestration of sequences that dont seem possible in a video game. Id say the business with that vault qualifies.Its rare for a series at deaths door to find a second wind. But by the time a sequence after the closing credits tells us whats hilariously to come in ""Fast Six you sense that the filmmakers have a giddy if diabolical sense of purpose. They want to clobber us with other peoples cash but the series isnt above treating itself like an ATM either.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Twitter.com wesley_morris.

By Colin Covert April 30 2011 -- 548pm Jaimie Trueblood Mct Paul Walker and Vin Diesel in ""Fast Five"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint As adolescent male power fantasies go ""Fast Five"" has an undeniable trashy charm. Things blow up right and left muscle cars are pulverized sexpots vamp and brawny men wallop the tar out of each other. Yet there are pauses between adrenaline-packed driving sequences shootouts and explosions for three romance subplots and two involving babies. Heres a popcorn flick strong enough for a man and gentle enough for a woman. The story such as it is begins with an exhilarating escape from a prison-bound police bus that rivals the spectacular train wreck that opens ""The Fugitive."" Cut to Rio de Janeiro where road-racing bandits Vin Diesel Paul Walker and Jordana Brewster join in a train robbery that ends with them wrongly accused of killing several DEA agents. With vengeful FBI agent Dwayne Johnson now on their tail they plan a 100 million caper that will allow their team to move to countries with no extradition and no speed limits. Like a grease-monkey ""Oceans Thirteen"" the film reassembles the cast of earlier installments with Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges Tyrese Gibson and Sung Kang back on board. The film is handsomely and atmospherically shot in gritty hillside slums and backstreet garages. This is not the tour-guide Rio of bikinis and palm trees. The story makes only one excursion to the citys beaches and its a treat. A leggy member of Diesels crew does a Girl From Ipanema act in order to obtain a crooks handprint needed to open a high-tech safe. Her hands-on approach is more fun than lifting his fingerprints off a doorknob so you give the pandering scene a pass. Its a bigger stretch to ignore the fact that the crooks level half of Rio while street racing with the policia in the finale. The staggeringly destructive sequence stops just short of toppling the statue of Christ the Redeemer from his mountainous perch. FAST FIVE  OUT OF FOUR STARS  Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action sexual content and language. With performances that are adequate at best and stunts that defy the laws of physics ""Fast Five"" flouts every rule of good filmmaking but one -- its never dull. Thankfully director Justin Lin who filmed the previous two installments of the ""Fast"" quintet makes the proceedings noisy chaotic shameless fun. His extravagantly budgeted stunt scenes are so crisp and thrilling that youre willing to forfeit sharp storytelling and interesting characters. You cant have everything.

With vintage muscle cars and special-purpose monster trucks over-the-top-stunts and a heist that makes Danny Oceans meticulously timed takedowns look like the stuff of a preschool party game this fourth sequel in the Fast and Furious franchise is blissfully brainlessly satisfying. More about Fast Five >> Its also about a half-hour too long but director Justin Lin who has now presided over three of these testosteronic affairs (starting with Tokyo Drift) can be forgiven. Let a kid loose in Toys R Us and its hard not to fill the shopping cart sky high. Fast Five opens with an audacious highway bust-out Dominic (Vin Diesel) is en route to prison where hes looking at 25 years when his pals Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) roar up alongside the bus carrying the jailbirds and topple the thing. If this was the real world the movie would end right here Theres no way anyone could survive that high-speed bus crash let alone walk away and fly off to Rio. And Rio de Janeiro is where they go. The filmmakers must have binged on repeated viewings of City of God and the first quarter of Edward Nortons The Incredible Hulk and realized there wasnt a better place on Earth to stage shantytown shootouts and rooftop chases splashed in vibrant graffiti colors. Throw in swooping aerial shots of Sugarloaf and the statue of Christ arms outstretched gazing down at the bay the beaches and the beautiful Brazilians - its downright cinematic. Plot? Fast Five has about five of them a train heist; a rescue mission; a kabillionaire drug lord (Joaquim de Almeida) with a vengeful streak; a MacGuffin of a computer chip and a bank job that involves removing a house-sized steel vault and towing it away with a couple of turbocharged automobiles. This is a reunion movie too as various sidekicks and supporting players from earlier installments - the grinning garrulous Roman (Tyrese Gibson) the master safecracker Tej (Ludacris) ace wheelman Han (Sung Kang) the Dominican duo Leo (Tego Calderon) and Santos (Don Omar) and the glammy whats-she-do-exactly? Gisele (Gal Godot) - assemble to plan and preen. And in the Battle of the Biceps Dwayne Johnson joins the fray as the square-jawed FBI guy determined to bring Dominic and his buddies back to the States. When Diesel and The Rock trade dialogue - and fists and automatic weapons fire - before partnering up to fight the evil drug king its like a thespian grand master class. Olivier and Burton fuggedaboutit. In the end Fast Five for all its propulsive police pursuits and its bad boys in pursuit of money is wholesome we-are-the-world stuff. Its not much of a spoiler to note that in one of the movies quiet moments (there are two) Mia announces shes pregnant. Boyfriend Brian takes a nanosecond to consider this news strokes his two-day beard and beams with joy. And Dom and the gang huddle around to express their joy and approval too.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Jaimie Trueblood In this film publicity image released by Universal Pictures Dwayne Johnson is shown in a scene from ""Fast Five."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Jaimie Trueblood) Picture yourself in a cafe in Rio enjoying tangerine tea and a marshmallow pie. Suddenly somebody drives down the sidewalk -- a cop with maniacal eyes. You do a samba sidestep to avoid the car but it plows into a mother and son at a nearby ice-cream stand. The vehicle squeals to a stop and the hulking driver leans over the weeping boy who cradles his dying mother in his lap. ""Dont do drugs"" the driver says. Then he flashes a dazzling smile and you realize hes Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. And hes gone.That trippy scene must have been deleted from ""Fast Five."" Any intrusion of true emotion or collateral consequences would spoil the fun of this beefsteak bacchanal. Like the other fantasies in the ""Fast and Furious"" series this ridiculous flick is all about cool cars confiscated cash and compliant cuties. The trendy new setting is Brazil where diehard car thief Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and ex-cop Brian OConner (Paul Walker) are going to pull ""one last job"" before retiring.They assemble a dream team including Doms sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) safecracker Tej (Ludacris) mechanic Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and honeytrap Gisele (Gal Gadot). Because their target is Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) a corrupt industrialist who controls the drug trade in Rios favela slums everything they do is excusable in the eyes of previously principled filmmaker Justin Lin (""Better Luck Tomorrow""). Even when American agent Hobbs (Johnson) arrives on the scene and starts slaughtering local henchmen hes impressed by Toretto who spares his life in a man-to-man meatdown -- er beatdown -- that is one of the highlights of the movie.Another highlight is the death-defying scene in which the thieves speed down the streets dragging what is essentially a 10-ton mace that levels buildings and whips corrupt cops into submission -- without harming a single civilian. ""Fast Five"" represents Yankee ingenuity of the brutally stupid kind.

(Trueblood) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday April 28 2011 400 AM Title Fast Five Action sequel about a high-stakes heist. With Vin Diesel Dwayne Johnson. Director Justin Lin (210). PG-13 language violence. At area theaters. Now this is how you make a summer movie. So what if its only April? ""Fast Five"" is determined to kick off popcorn season in high-octane style. And while you may not leave enlightened youll definitely be entertained. Having also helmed the last two ""Fast and the Furious"" sequels director Justin Lin has become something of an autoeur with a clear understanding of what makes these movies work cool cars tight chases and characters we can root for. The latter is key; without a moral center the franchise would have fallen apart long before we got to number five. Holding it all together is Dom (Vin Diesel) a big-hearted con who honors family above all. So its no surprise when his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) and her BF--and Doms BFF--Brian (Paul Walker) risk everything to break him out of prison. This puts them all on the radar of unstoppable agent Hobbs (Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson) who soon learns Dom wants to rob Brazils richest man (Joaquim de Almeida). Coming along for this 180mph ride are several cohorts from other films including Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) who proved much-needed comic relief. As the team works furiously to plan the heist Hobbes moves ever closer to his target. Johnson has always been a good sport so he gamely pretends the entirely-unthreatening Diesel is his match. In reality its almost comical to see them face off though there is enough testosterone here to burn a hole through the screen. Fortunately Lin and returning writer Chris Morgan know how to work a balancing act. They bring in a stronger female presence to add some human interest; alternate action with emotion; and follow every serious moment with a head-snapping surprise. Sure a lot of the dialogue is dopey and the eternally stiff leads once again compete for blankest delivery. But Lin distracts us well packing deftly-shot races explosions and getaways into every corner. In fact the biggest problem is that the movie is way too long he and Morgan keep throwing out ending after ending as if they cant bear to let us go. In a way though thats a welcome instinct. Even if you pay extra for Imax (well worth it) ""Fast Five"" feels like a genuine attempt to give us a good time rather than the typically-cynical grab for our wallets. Its not often you leave a sequel this far into a series and think ""How quick can they make number six?""

They tear the side of the train off drive the auto away and then zoom it over a cliff. That last bit isnt really part of the plan -- its just what happens -- and when they escape in free fall with a stomach-dropping whoosh plunging into a space vast and wide enough to be the air above the Grand Canyon its like that daredevil leap in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Theres barely a sound except for the audience going ""Ohhhhhh"" Now thats entertainment. Its what keeps so many of us coming back to the Fast/Furious franchise the vicarious promise of cheating death all executed in such a casual youthful fashion that it could almost be a dance move. Directed by the flashy and gifted Justin Lin (who also helmed the series previous two entries) Fast Five isnt a hotdogging road-race movie until the very end. Its set amid the squalor of Rio with its teeming vertical slums and its basically a heist thriller in which the insult-swapping gang members led by Diesel and his invincible growl are hired to steal a drug lords fortune from the vault of a police station. The film is basically Oceans Fourteen starring a multiculti version of the cast of Jersey Shore. The final chase -- it features cars and that vault -- is badass heaven.

The 10-year run of the ""Fast and Furious"" roadshow isnt slowing down a bit in ""Fast Five"" by most measures the best of the bunch combining fresh casting choices interesting Rio locales and literally smashing bookended action sequences. With the street-racing gang on the lam they must confront two forces -- pursuing feds and an intimidating drug kingpin -- that push their heist skills to new genuinely exciting limits. Pics ideal balance of familiar and new will ensure high-octane theatrical returns setting a breakneck pace for vid and ancillary down the road. In a movie era lacking in many of the brawny leading men of the 80s or the manly stars of the 50s and 60s the pics match-up of Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson (first on opposite sides of the law then drawn together as allies) reps a welcome injection of tough-guy vigor. ""Fast Five"" is an entertainment that knows its working and it makes perfectly clear by the end (spiced with an uncredited cameo by Eva Mendes) that the Vin and Dwayne show isnt over with this fifth entry in a series that looks as if it could go on for another decade if everyone stays in shape. After breaking Dominic (Diesel) out of his 25-year California jail sentence by staging a massive prison bus accident on a highway Brian (Paul Walker) and Mia (Jordana Brewster) head down to Rio where partner Vince (Matt Schulze) has a new job lined up for them. But since it involves shady-looking cohorts a speeding train and three hot cars under DEA jurisdiction everything that can go wrong does in a brilliantly paced suspensefully edited sequence flecked withbits of humor. Dominic and Brian are captured by the king of the Rio drug trade the appropriately named Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida smartly cast) who demands to know where his stolen cars are located. The two realize theyre up against a powerful bad guy with greater reach more thugs and bigger guns than their enemies in the previous installments. Escaping with implausible ease as soon as Reyes departs the two reunite with Mia and discover Reyes computer chip which contains the data on his entire operation. Enter Johnsons intensely muscled FBI agent Hobbs an uber-hip Dudley Do-Right type famed for never failing to hunt down his prey. He recruits Rio cop Elena (Elsa Pataky) since his thorough research has found her to be incorruptible and having lost her husband in the line of fire highly motivated. Typical of the pics rigorously maintained pace Hobbs unit soon raids the racers hideout in a Rio favela initiating some terrific stuntwork (supervised by Mike Gunther) amid obliterated shanty houses. Even as Brian absorbs Mias news that shes pregnant Dominic drops his plan on them Pull a world-class crew together for a heist to rob Reyes of his 11 million cash holdings. This includes some of the more memorable supporting characters from previous episodes such as loquacious Roman (Tyrese Gibson) safecracker ace Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and racer extraordinaire Han (Sung Kang) along with Gisele (Gal Gadot) and Dominican buddies Leo (Tego Calderon) and Santos (Don Omar). Director Justin Lin (who helmed the franchises past two entries) is interested in the geometrics of the heist -- which actually comes in two variations the latter far more complex than the former -- and the complexities of the crew having two different opponents. The second half of ""Fast Five"" elaborately and humorously plays out the back-and-forth tactics that ultimately lead to a stunning finale chase sequence spanning much of downtown Rio and seems inspired in part by a similarly spectacular scene in ""Bad Boys II."" The inevitable fight between Diesel and Johnson which practically oozes sweat is far from the movies climax and doesnt even suggest the plot turns to come indicating how much more developed Chris Morgans script is than the standard action fare. It also suggests that the sixth entry could be something worth waiting for especially since Johnson works as a perfect counter to the easy bond between Diesel and Walker. Audiences in Brazil are likely to respond to ""Fast Five"" in a slightly different way than in other countries since the pic will trigger for them fresh memories of local B.O. champ ""Elite Squad The Enemy Within"" which similarly depicted the deep corruption among Rio cops vis-a-vis the drug trade M- though the BOPE Rios own SWAT team and the heart of the ""Elite Squad"" movies is nowhere to be seen in ""Fast Five.""

After busting out of a prison van global car thief Dom (Diesel) hatches a plan to rob Rios biggest drug baron of his cash. Meanwhile his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) has a little boy/girl racer on the way thanks to cop-turned-robber Brian (Walker). To get the stash theyre going to need fast cars and a team of experts cue characters from past films introduced in the style of Oceans Eleven.The heist plot is lightly enjoyable even if the finer details get muddied in a puff of exhaust smoke. Theres an amusing love-hate bromance between Diesel and newcomer to the series Dwayne Johnson who sports a beard in case slower viewers should get confused. Overlong but slick this still gets away with simplistic dialogue and characters perhaps because it doesnt take itself too seriously. And judging by the post-credits scene theres yet more fast and furious tomfoolery to come.

Her take on it - a terrible film. My take on it - also pretty terrible. Definitely the weakest of the F+F films. The cars take a back seat (pun intended) in this installment. The film works more as a very poor mans Oceans 11 than a racing film. Characters spend most of the film planning a robbery - then carry out said robbery using a completely different plan. WTF?

Definitely 2 stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 26 2011edFeaturedWell it obviously took a lot of practice but it has took 4 films for them to finally ge it RIGHT This is by far the best in series. Greta visuals great sound formidable baddie / pursuer (THE ROCK) less CGI more cars more women better sounds and better dialogue. OK so its not original in the slightest its transparently OCEANS 11 on wheels but wasn;t the orignal a rip-off of POINT BREAK? The camerarderie shows through and all the old ""favourites"" show up again.... Even Matt Schulze from part 1 is given a meaty role (if you can call it that) Some of the stunts were OTT men bounce off bridges and buildings and are still able to run. Refuse trucks outrun Sports cars (you get my drift) Saferooms are located next to underground car parks...(heh) But on the whole a truly great sequel and also an apology for the very sorry 4th installment... Roll on Part 6.gt; (Never thought Id here myself say that)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 24 2011AhmedFeaturedThis Movie is without doubt Movie of the Year..Period. its freakin awesome...this movie takes the fast edgey look it had on its previous films and times it by 10trillion..its Fast..Its a hell of a lot Furious and its hitting its way to the top of the charts...easyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 24 2011AhmedFeaturedThis Movie is without doubt Movie of the Year..Period. its freakin awesome...this movie takes the fast edgey look it had on its previous films and times it by 10trillion..its Fast..Its a hell of a lot Furious and its hitting its way to the top of the charts...easyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 24 2011JessFeaturedbest film ive seen in a long time. i would definately pay to go watch it againFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 24 2011JessFeaturedbest film ive seen in a long time. i would definately pay to go watch it againFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 24 2011IanFeaturedThe review has it about right. Loud brash and in your face subtle this isnt. If you loves the first four you will love this one too. If you didnt love the first film dont bother. I expect it will do well enough for Fast 6 no doubt in 3D to be coming our way in 2 or 3 years. The film looks good The chase and fight scenes look better and the girls wear tight clothes or very little clothing. If you are male between 15 and 25 you may love it. A young male pair for Beastly for the girls. You know what you are going to get before you walk in and it doesnt disappoint.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 22 2011baalFeaturedthe movie is simply awesomeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 22 2011baalFeaturedthe movie is simply awesomeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89727/fast-furious-5.html,200,fastfive31,fastfive,timeout

TWITTER Paul Walker Vin Diesel and Jordana Brewster return for the fifth installment the third film directed by Justin Lin in the aFast and Furiousa universe. SYDNEY -- Are we there yet? The answer sure to please a frothing Fast and the Furious fan base is not nearly. The wheels have yet to come off this car-crazy franchise and the fifth installment set in a much grittier Rio than the recent screen version populated by animated birds puts several more gallons of gas in the tank. There may be more brains in your bucket of popcorn but this gleefully silly smash-em-up heist film is sturdy enough to restore much of the fan goodwill torched by the horror movie that was the Diesel-free The Fast and the Furious Tokyo Drift. Big crashes lithe women and roiling testosterone not to mention the addition of The Rock as a fire-and-brimstone federal agent - theres plenty to pull in the (mostly) young male audience thats shelled out a cumulative 1 billion over a decade to follow the turbo-charged adventures of a gang of street-racers. Fast Five (also known as Fast and Furious 5 outside North America) is primed to equal if not better the 71 million opening weekend of its 2009 predecessor and if a sixth film were not already in the works that kind of coin would guarantee it. Director Justin Lin back for his third go-around opens it up in top gear; a mere 30 seconds elapse before the first screech of tires rents the air. Showing the blithe disregard for the laws of physics and logic that defines the series former cop Brian OConner (Paul Walker) and girlfriend Mia (Jordana Brewster) use a matching pair of hot rods to bust Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) out of a prison transport van. All three go on the lam in Rio de Janeiro where logic would dictate that Lin make the most of the citys famously underclad residents and luscious beach backdrops. But no. Instead we get favelas and back-street garages and gun-toting bad guys. Lin knows perhaps that his target demographic can live without the surplus eye-candy; they come to see shiny muscle cars getting totalled and they would likely do so if Fast Five were set in Scranton Penn. While gearheads may be disappointed at the final tally of choreographed car crashes and have their patience tested by lengthy collision-free stretches Lin serves up at least two set pieces that hit new heights of metal-crunching mayhem. This is the most expensive installment yet and its clear the budget wasnt used on acting lessons for the cast. After making a mortal enemy of the citys reigning drug lord Reyes (Joaquim de Almeida) Dom and company find themselves in a jam that makes illegal street-racing look like kids stuff. With tank-like federal agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) hot on their trail and Reyes henchmen blasting at them with rocket-propelled grenades Dom decides the only way to buy freedom is with 100 million of Reyes money. So he assembles a dream team calling in franchise favorites including Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) Roman (Tyrese Gibson) Han (Sung Kang) and Gisele (Gal Gadot) for ""one last job."" Thats about it for plot really with the crew making an apathetic stab at nutting out a clever Oceans 11-style heist strategy before reverting to type and just smashing through the obstacles. Perhaps its just as well or audiences may never have been treated to the sight of a giant reinforced steel vault careening through the streets of downtown Rio de Janeiro tethered to a pair of muscle cars. Screenwriter Chris Morgan peppers his dialogue-light script with a couple of good zingers and Johnson appears to be having fun with his overzealous staccato delivery. Walker and Brewster are as one-dimensional as ever even while harboring a little secret that may see us lumbered with a future instalment titled Fast and Furious The Next Generation.
