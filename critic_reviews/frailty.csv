""Frailty"" would have been so much better if the movies big twist -- the twist that changes everything that came before it -- worked. The main twist and a series of subsequent revelations -- some predictable others unnecessary -- could spark the kind of repeat business that ""The Sixth Sense"" generated in 1999 but its sure to disappoint the second time around. This is despite the fact that ""Frailty"" is dripping with mood and that Bill Paxton directing for the first time maintains the suspense. The story of a family of serial killers in a small Texas town is spooky from the first frame with haunting performances all around -- especially from Paxton who stars as the father and Matt OLeary who plays his oldest son. ""Frailty"" begins with OLearys character Fenton Meiks (played as an adult by Matthew McConaughey) visiting Dallas FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) to tell him he knows the identity of the notorious Gods Hand killer. Doyle has been investigating a series of murders across the state. Fenton says the killer is his younger brother Adam and persuades Doyle to drive with him to the small town outside Abilene where he grew up to show him where the bodies are buried. As they make their journey Fenton describes what happened when he was 12 and Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) was 9. He recalls how their father woke them up one night and told them hed seen a vision from an angel who said he and his sons must rid the world of demons. God would give them the weapons and a list of names of people who look like regular folk but are really evil incarnate. Adam is young enough to seek his fathers approval and follows his wishes but Fenton is old enough to be skeptical and thinks Dad has gone insane. Since their mother died giving birth to Adam Fenton has no one to turn to for help. The trio goes on a killing spree over a series of nights with Fenton fighting each step of the way. Soon Dad starts thinking his own son is a demon too and locks him in a cellar -- the same place where Dad killed the sheriff who came round the house snooping. Paxton is at his scariest when he tries not to be scary. When he looks into the eyes of his frightened children and matter-of-factly tells them ""God has willed this and we must obey God."" Its far more harrowing than any wild-eyed homicidal raving because he truly believes hes doing the right thing. McConaughey gets top billing but Paxton steals the show. And OLeary more than holds his own again here. Too bad its in a movie that fails to live up to its potential. ""Frailty"" is rated R for violence and gore (both discreet by horror standards) as well as scattered use of profanity (mostly religiously based). Running time 100 minutes.

Though Brent Hanleys script feels like its based on an account of white Anglo-Saxon serial its a genuine invention that has its cinematic roots in rich horror soil. A resoundingly old-fashioned and well crafted study of evil infecting an American family ""Frailty"" moves from strength to strength on its deceptive narrative course. Though Brent Hanleys script feels like its based on an account of white Anglo-Saxon serial killers run amok in middle America its a genuine invention that has its cinematic roots in the rich soil plowed by such disparate works as Charles Laughtons ""Night of the Hunter"" and Tobe Hoopers ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Pics dark-night-of-the-soul mood derives from the former while the latter inspired the notion that the family that kills together stays together. Final effect is of a timeless work that could have been made at any point in the past 20 years. Indie pics commercial clout is greatly enhanced with stars Bill Paxton (who also directed) and Matthew McConaughey; while ""Frailty"" should do good theatrical biz it will carry on an especially durable life in ancillary. Pic is McConaugheys most fully developed performance in several seasons; for Paxton it adds to his growing gallery of nuanced conflicted men from the heartland while demonstrating that in his feature helming debut he already possesses the chops of a front-rank director. After an intriguing title sequence coursing with headlines about an unsolved series of murders pic begins in the offices of Dallas-based FBI agent Wesley Doyle (Powers Boothe) whos with a man claiming to know the truth about the East Texas serial killing spree known as the ""Gods Hand"" murders. Calling himself Fenton Meiks (McConaughey) the man tells Doyle his brother Adam was behind the killings and that he committed suicide the previous night. Meiks tells his ghoulish family story which pic divides into two large flashback sections of 26 and 41 minutes each gracefully overlaid with Meiks v.o. narration. In 1979 Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) and his older brother Fenton (Matt OLeary) are being raised by Dad (Paxton) a widower since Adams birth. They live an apparently peaceful almost blissful existence in the small town of Thurman living -- in just the right Hitchcockian touch -- in a nice little house tucked behind the towns rose garden. Paxtons utterly unmannered unobtrusive direction offers no hint of whats to come nor does his character as Dad is the model of a gentle loving father. Then Dad wakes the boys up in the middle of the night to tell them hes had a vision God wants the three of them to serve as warriors to wipe out demons on Earth during these the days of ""the final battle."" Young Fenton like the aud is immediately thrown by Dads startling transformation. Unlike Jack Nicholsons developing madness in ""The Shining"" Paxtons Dad remains calm and collected throughout perturbed only by his eldest sons resistance to what he views as a divine mission. At the same time this psychological drama is turning the screws ""Frailty"" builds up considerable tension as a murder thriller. While Paxton is careful to fix his camera away from the gore and on the faces of the family members as Dads ""magic"" axe falls on one chosen victim after another watching the serial killing is deeply disturbing . The clash between father and son reaches a turning point when after young Fenton witnesses Dad killing the local sheriff (Luke Askew) he is imprisoned in the basement for weeks. Feigning madness and claiming to have seen God Fenton eventually wins Dads trust leading to some especially Gothic twists. McConaughey reveals only as much about Meiks as he needs to and never a moment too soon. Its a poker-face performance supreme both a portrait of a sons tragedy and of a son absorbing his fathers legacy. Paxton finds his match in OLeary delivering one of the most impressive child perfs of recent years. Indeed there are large stretches of pic that are dominated by the young thesp brimming with innocence terror and unbridled anger at an incomprehensible fate. Boothe suggests an FBI man who takes nothing for granted and proves more perceptive than he realizes. Sumpters young Adam is a boy who simply wants his family to stay together. Tech package reps an exceptional display of artistry led above all by Bill Butlers expressive lensing. In the daylight Butler pushes for an effect that closely resembles ""flashing"" technique producing a hazy bleached quality thats hypnotic. At night a darkened storybook style takes over. Both visual palettes are richly supported by Nelson Coates and Kevin Cozens art direction (so-called in lieu of typical production design credit) while Brian Tylers music lurks in the background. Arnold Glassmans editing keeps the flashback-flashforward story firmly on course.

Still Doyle listens to the story which starts in 1979 when Fenton aged 12 and Adam nine lived happily with their widowed dad (Paxton) - until one night when he burst into their room claiming to have been visited by an angel. Their divine mission henceforth was to seek out and destroy any demons walking the earth disguised as ordinary folk. Paxtons first movie as director is better than you might expect. It has a first rate cast and Bill Butlers camerawork and some deft editing help to crank up the tension. Some scenes are a little primitive in execution but thats sometimes a benefit in this kind of American Gothic. Brent Hanleys script while ultimately too tricky and tortuous for its own good boasts enough intriguing developments to hold the attention and it also treats such motifs as child abuse paranoid delusion and religious mania with more than a little intelligence.

"Frailty A Sixth Sense Without Any washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Frailty A Sixth Sense Without Any Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 12 2002 The word ""frailty"" may exactly describe your state of mind after seeing the film of that title. But then why would you want to? ""Frailty"" is a pretty tough sit possibly more excruciating if youre a parent. At a screening this week civilians were fleeing - almost as if they were watching a spectacularly gruesome and emotionally destructive if fictitious account of child abuse mounted to provide two tweaks of emotion in a clumsily telegraphed surprise ending. Oh wait that is what they were watching. ""Frailty"" although its a 100 percent Texas production recalls not the Lone Star State but the city of Philadelphia as represented in M. Night Shyamalans far better ""The Sixth Sense."" Clearly the Texans involved - star/director Bill Paxton star Matthew McConaughey and ex-star Powers Boothe - were following the ""Sixth Sense"" paradigm in hopes of reaping similar financial and career glory They are trying to build a small dark tautly plotted disturbing but not terribly gory occult thriller with materials so sensational that people wont stop talking about it. Bad try Tex. Instead the movie is so disturbing that it seems nearly blasphemous. I wouldnt wish it on an anthrax spore. After all anthrax has feelings too. Structurally - more evidence that whoever invented postmodernism should be shot - the movie is one of those flashback-o-ramas so densely mixed up in time that sometimes there are visions within flashbacks within flashbacks all of which make no sense in terms of point-of-view appropriateness. But you probably wont notice because youll be so busy recoiling. A lone figure shows up at the Dallas FBI office late one rainy night to see the agent in charge of the infamous ""Gods Hand"" serial murders gripping the city. People are being butchered by some kind of religious maniac claiming to be working for the Big Guy. Calling himself Fenton Meiks (McConaughey) he unburdens himself to Agent Doyle (Boothe) so the tale unfolds in foreshortened truncated form helped along by lugubrious narration. It concerns Dad (Paxton) and the young Fenton (Matthew OLeary) and the younger Adam (Jeremy Sumpter) in their bungalow in small-town Texas just outside the metropolis. Out of the blue Dad a humble mechanic awakened his two boys one night in the 70s and informed them that God had just spoken to him and had given him a job. He was now the No. 1 demon-killer and the two boys then about 12 and 8 were his assistants. God in His methodical way had given Dad a list of seven demons to be destroyed. Funny they look just like people Texans even. So the three of them set out to kidnap beat and torture those listed take them to the family cellar and dismember them with a ritual ax named Otis. Paxton as a director knows how powerful this notion is The father forcing the boys one of whom is reluctant and the other of whom really digs it to watch and participate in terrible crimes. So he doesnt show us anything lurid upon which rests his thin claim to seriousness of purpose. Instead we watch - time after time - the horror dancing in Fentons eyes as he witnesses Dad using Otis as if its the flaming sword of Jehovah. The central conflict is Fentons rationality vs. Dad and Adams true belief which ultimately causes Dad in the guise of loving guidance from a parent to torture Fenton in grotesque psychological and physical ways such as brutal forced labor or confinement in darkness and thirst for extended periods of time. This is appalling. Of course as most movie-savvy people will intuit the connection between that story and the arrival in the office of this particular federal agent are not exactly unrelated. The movie begins its whatta-twist dance when the two men go back to the small town and confront the various fates of those concerned including themselves. Yeah its kind of clever in the most shallow sense of cleverness but it has no resonance no reverberation. Its just a trick. The rule is Show me anything if its true and it teaches me something new but never show me something ugly for the sake of making a few bucks and getting back into the Hollywood limelight. FRAILTY (R 100 minutes) - Contains extreme emotional intensity involving violence and child abuse. At area theaters.

Starring Adrian Grenier Sarah Michelle Gellar and Joey Lauren Adams. Directed by James Toback. (R. 105 minutes. At the Roxie Cinema.) Writer-director James Toback (""Two Girls and a Guy"") has entered that enviable career stage where his movies are automatically interesting because he made them. Like those of the best auteurs his films are invitations to wallow in a sensibility thats hard to resist. But Toback isnt coasting. His latest ""Harvard Man"" has everything you could ever want from a Toback movie lurid sex shocking excess and an out-of- nowhere thoughtfulness thats not put on; its real. As early as ""Fingers"" (1978) Toback was showing how the highest and lowest impulses could be raging within a single individual. That same fascination is at work in ""Harvard Man."" Adrian Grenier plays a young Harvard student with a complicated life. Hes a college basketball player whose cheerleader girlfriend (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the daughter of a Mafia boss. He is also a philosophy major having an affair with his professor played by Joey Lauren Adams. Toback isnt afraid of talkie scenes. He is comfortable using a single setup and letting the characters whip through pages of dialogue. Grenier and Adams have a long bedroom scene in which she tries to warn the drug-friendly youngster away from using LSD. ""Its cyanide"" she says. But Toback never indulges himself at the audiences expense. He earns the right to take his time when needed by crafting an overall story of genuine tension -- the Mafia girlfriend ropes our young hero into a plot to throw the game. He also knows how to play with time with seeming ease to juggle past and present in the editing to illuminate both. Grenier is a find and ""Harvard Man"" should mark Gellars entrance into full-fledged adulthood as far as her castability is concerned. Yet the performer most worth noting is Adams who would be an unlikely choice to play a philosophy professor except that she seems to understand every word she says. Adams sparkles with quick-mindedness and verbal agility. This is a worthy and underused talent. Advisory This film contains drug use and sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle LOLA Romance. Starring Anouk Aimee. Directed and written by Jacques Demy. (Not rated. 90 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere today through April 18; at the Rafael Film Center in San Rafael today through April 15.) Soft and evanescent lyrical but bittersweet Jacques Demys first film is like a dream that one enters -- and then recalls for years afterward with absolute pleasure. Filmed in 1961 ""Lola"" is an ode to yearning and enchantment -- a valentine to France to beautiful women to the foolish but delicious notions of romance that we receive from Hollywood. Anouk Aimee (""A Man and a Woman"") is heavenly as Lola a dance-hall girl in the port city of Nantes (Demys hometown). Part phantom and part voluptuary Lola is the kind of woman who wants ""always to be alluring"" who wiggles when she walks whos fond of a drink who likes to primp and smoke and speak in a breathy voice. As a young girl Lola dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer but ""got lost"" she explains. Early in the story she runs into Roland (Marc Michel) an old flame who becomes smitten all over again. Lola rebuffs him; she still pines for Michel the broad-shouldered Adonis who loved her and left her with a 7- year-old son. Demy shot ""Lola"" in black and white dedicated it to filmmaker Max Ophuls (""The Earrings of Madame de . . ."") and constructs an Ophuls-like daisy chain of interconnecting chance encounters. Like Ophuls he lets his camera glide and swirl around his characters -- as if he were embracing them and their heady illusions. Demy died in 1990 and his widow director Agnes Varda supervised the restoration of his exquisite muted jewel of a film. -- Edward Guthmann FESTIVAL IN CANNES Drama. Starring Anouk Aimee Greta Scacchi Maximilian Schell and Ron Silver. Directed by Henry Jaglom. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At the Embarcadero Center Cinema.) Henry Jaglom keeps making Henry Jaglom films and theyre always compelling sometimes in a car-wreck sort of way and sometimes in a truthful way thats only his. ""Festival in Cannes"" is one of his better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love set against the wheeling and dealing atmosphere of the worlds most famous film festival. Jaglom like the French director Eric Rohmer is in love with love. Unlike Rohmer Jaglom is a cynic. More artist than thinker Jaglom says more than he thinks hes saying in ""Festival in Cannes"" and thats all to the good. The festival backdrop may be intended to lend enchantment to a tale of three generations of lovers finding each other over a span of days. But under the steady gaze of Jagloms camera Cannes looks like a worn beach town defaced by movie billboards. Nothing of value will come of this festival -- or of these relationships. Thats the cynical and refreshing message being communicated here. Anouk Aimee plays a French actress juggling two offers a starring role in an independent film from a first-time director (Greta Scacchi) and a small role in a blockbuster being fronted by Ron Silver as a big-time Hollywood sleaze. Through this false dichotomy -- theres no reason the actress cant accept both offers -- the movie gives Aimee a chance to shine and illustrates the difficulties actors face. Everyone flatters them; everyone wants to use them. Maximilian Schell is well cast as Aimees ex-husband a great director who hasnt made a film in years. ""Its so hard to make a film"" he says. ""Sometimes I think its enough to dream them."" The younger generation is represented by Jenny Gabrielle as a novice who comes to Cannes an unknown and overnight finds herself the talk of the festival. Its a dream come true but Jaglom is too honest to present the upheaval in her life as anything other than emotionally disconcerting the kind of thing that would make any young person want to latch on to a new lover just to hold on to something. -- Mick LaSalle HUMAN NATURE Comedy. Starring Patricia Arquette Tim Robbins Rhys Ifans and Miranda Otto. Directed by Michael Gondry. (R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Human Nature"" is a sly comedy that lives up to the promise of its title. It explores the contest between civilization and brute impulse and does so with a combination of screw-loose zaniness and intellectual rigor. The result is a satisfying and original picture. Patricia Arquette plays Lila a young woman who at puberty started growing fur all over her body. As an adult in order to pass in society she spends a lot of time shaving herself -- everywhere. Meanwhile her boyfriend Nathan played by Tim Robbins at his uptight best researches ways of teaching civilization to mammals. He gets the ultimate chance to test his behavior theories when he comes upon a man (Rhys Ifans) who was raised by apes. He brings him to his laboratory and sets about teaching him to be an ascot- wearing wine-drinking lover of opera. Written by Charlie Kaufman who wrote ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Human Nature"" is characterized by smart quirky dialogue throughout though the funniest moments are sight gags involving the newly civilized ape man who may have the veneer of refinement but is clearly hanging by a thread. In one scene he is taken to a restaurant and in the midst of placing his order leaps from the table and starts rubbing against the waitress. The fact that he is wearing an electric collar and knows he will be punished for this makes it all the funnier. The point of ""Human Nature"" is that left to our own devices all of us would be as impulsive and animal-like. That would hardly be worth saying but the movie has a more subtle point -- that civilization itself far from being an instrument of civility is the most efficient tool through which people are able to implement and get away with their most monumental acts of selfishness and sensual gratification. Advisory This film contains nudity sexual situations and strong language. -- Mick LaSalle FRAILTY Suspense. Starring Matthew McConaughey and Bill Paxton. Directed by Paxton. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In his directing debut actor Bill Paxton has made a truly awful picture instead of a merely vapid one. ""Frailty"" about a single father who thinks God wants him to kill evildoers is dumb but also unrelentingly dark and ugly thereby depriving the viewer of any camp value. Daddy the Demon Slayer is played with maniacal fervor by Paxton who could have used a good director to rein him in. He apparently directed his fellow actors including Matthew McConaughey and granite-faced Powers Boothe to look as morose as possible while he filled in gaps with dark filters and ominous music. The script by Brent Hanley veers from silly and hackneyed to gruesome and hackneyed. When McConaughey guesses that Boothe became an FBI agent after Boothes mother was murdered the agent replies ""Have you thought about a career in law enforcement? You really have a feel for it."" Hes serious. McConaughey as Paxtons grown-up son has approached the FBI because he believes his brother grew up to be a serial killer like Pops. In flashback he recalls how the dad enlisted the boys to lure people into his van ""Silence of the Lambs"" style. ""Frailty"" focuses on the kids trauma to an unseemly degree. The boys witness numerous killings and one is nearly starved to death by the dad. The movie enumerates the horrors these kids experience without a glimmer of hope that they might emerge OK. Matt OLeary the abused kid in ""Domestic Disturbance"" had it easy in that picture compared with what he endures here. Director Paxton bludgeons where he could finesse. When the father pulls the shade down before the umpteenth ax slaying you think youll be spared the carnage. No dice. The whack happens off-camera but the blood spurts into the frame. Visual cliches run rampant. Fog shrouds the public garden where the bodies are buried. Shadows from the partition in a cop car play on McConaugheys face. You can say one thing for novice director Paxton though The scene of a miniature angel descending through a carburetor is a true original. Advisory This film contains violence and raw language. -- Carla Meyer BORSTAL BOY Drama. Starring Shawn Hatosy Danny Dyer and Michael York. Directed by Peter Sheridan. (Not rated. 91 minutes. At the Opera Plaza.) ""Borstal Boy"" about the early life of Irish playwright Brendan Behan is a sincere piece of work with good performances and some illuminating moments. But its dragged down by a slow pace an intrinsic lack of dramatic tension and a somewhat naive treatment of the subject. The result is a film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration. The picture based on Behans memoirs begins with young Brendan (Shawn Hatosy) as a 16-year-old IRA zealot who is captured by British officials before he can follow through on a plan to blow up something in Liverpool. He is sent to a British borstal -- a kind of reform school -- which turns out to be the best thing that ever happened to him. Run by a sweet-natured warden (Michael York) the place is more like a boys camp than a prison. Some scenes have a casual truth about them that feels right. At night chilling newsreels of the Battle of Britain are shown on a movie screen but the boys barely react -- they just clown around and talk waiting for the feature to start. The growing friendship between Brendan and a young gay sailor (Danny Dyer) treated with sensitivity and detail becomes the center of the film. Yet something in the films handling of Behans emerging homosexuality feels a little too politically correct -- too accepted too cozy and too easy. For a macho Irish kid in 1940 there had to be some inner conflict. Or if the conflict wasnt there where was it? Somewhere for sure. Behan went on to drink himself to death in his early 40s. Yet theres no hint here of anything clouding this young mans psyche. It might be admirable that writer and co- director Peter Sheridan avoids cheap theatrics but no one should be congratulated in avoiding all theatrics. Thats just denying the dictates of the medium. Advisory This film contains strong language violence and some sexuality. -- Mick LaSalle THE OTHER SIDE OF HEAVEN Drama. Starring Christopher Gorham and Anne Hathaway. Directed and written by Mitch Davis. (PG. 113 minutes. At the Galaxy.) In the 1950s John Groberg left his hometown of Idaho Falls and went halfway across the world to the Kingdom of Tonga a South Pacific archipelago where he was sent as a missionary by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Groberg was 19 when he left his home and spent the first months on Tonga struggling with language barriers hurricanes mosquitoes and the islanders suspicions. His 1993 memoir ""In the Eye of the Storm"" has been adapted as ""The Other Side of Heaven"" a film that recaptures his early adventures and uses them as an example of the benefits of missionary work. ""The Other Side of Heaven"" made without church sponsorship is handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism. Directed and written by Mitch Davis it focuses primarily on Grobergs cultural adjustments on the island of Niuatoputapu but slips occasionally into sermonettes extolling the virtues of Christian service. Christopher Gorham who looks a bit like the young Tom Hanks is appealing as Groberg. Arriving at the island where he will live for three years Groberg cuts an odd profile in his suit and narrow tie surrounded by skeptical island men in grass skirts and women who titter that he looks ""whiter than soap."" Groberg learned Tongan by reading the Scriptures but for some reason the islanders played mostly by New Zealand actors speak English once he has learned Tongan. The South Pacific photography by Brian Breheny is very strong - - the film was shot in the Cook Islands -- and Anne Hathaway (""The Princess Diaries"") is lovely as the girlfriend Groberg leaves behind. -- Edward Guthmann SON OF THE BRIDE Drama. Starring Ricardo Darin Hector Alterio and Norma Aleandro. Directed by Juan Jose Campanella. Written by Campanella and Fernando Castets. (Rated R. 124 minutes. In Spanish with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) In Buenos Aires a workaholic restaurant owner neglects his daughter and mother and hasnt time for his girlfriend. ""Your lifes like a marathon"" a potential buyer observes. ""You remind me of a juggler spinning plates."" Rafael the lead character in ""Son of the Bride"" is one more manifestation of a cinematic cliche the pent-up cell-phone-addicted businessman who has to hit the wall before he can smell the roses. Juan Jose Campanella directs with such care and affection however and Ricardo Darin plays the lead character and his transitions so gracefully that it all goes down quite easily. Nominated for an Oscar as best foreign-language drama -- it lost to ""No Mans Land"" -- ""Son of the Bride"" finds Rafael suffering from tax pressures reduced profit margin and a financial climate that allows chains to buy at wholesale but penalizes mom-and-pop businessess. All that madness has made him a monster but after a mild heart attack and extended hospital stay hes a changed man -- and wants off the fast track. ""Son of the Bride"" manages to be affectionate without drawing too deeply from a well of sugar and schmaltz. After Rafaels breakthrough his dad (Hector Alterio) announces that he wants to remarry his mother in a church wedding. Theres dubious virtue in turning the Alzheimers-stricken mom (Norma Aleandro) into a spunky slightly raunchy woman-child but Campanella whose own parents remarried late in life finds the right tone and creates a very sweet moment with the elders wedding.

"USATODAY.com - Final payoff not worth the time in Frailty Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/11/2002 - Updated 1055 PM ET Final payoff not worth the time in Frailty By Mike Clark USA TODAY Frailty (out of four) Stars Bill Paxton Matthew McConaughey Matt OLeary Rated R for violence and language Director/lead Bill Paxtons Texas chiller is pretty fragile itself quietly methodical but too dependent on a contrived twist finale you sense is coming without being able to guess the specifics. The payoff isnt worth the time invested but at least the actor-turned-filmmaker underplays an inherently queasy project that could have been over the top. Matthew McConaughey in a surprisingly good turn plays a stranger who shows up at the Dallas FBI office to tell an agent (Powers Boothe) about a dead brother hes convinced was a serial killer. If so this man on the verge of committing suicide was not to blame for his or his brothers actions. As we then see in long flashbacks both siblings were raised by a single father (Paxton) whose ""visions"" drove him to kill local strangers and bury them in a nearby flower garden. The older brother (Matt OLeary as young McConaughey) was witness to the acts but unlike the far more willing younger boy (Jeremy Sumpter) he was an accomplice only under duress. Paxton is a lower-key psychotic than Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter creepy and no ones idea of father of the year but not particularly bloodcurdling. Acting honors go to OLeary who was also one of the few good things about Domestic Disturbance (on video next week). As with the finale of High Crimes the boomer that concludes the story plays like a stunt as if screenwriter Brent Hanley were scheming to take first place in a screenwriting competition. If nothing else the film is quite a comment on small-town law enforcement. There surely are a lot of bodies in this garden for someone not to be wondering where all these people -- were talking citizens not drifters -- have gone.

Also a religio-nutso thriller. Plus its a twisted bonding movie about a good widowed Texas daddy (Bill Paxton making his feature directing debut) who loves his two sons so much that he shatters their childhood A nighttime vision -- of an angel? A devil? A manifestation of insanity? -- compels him to enlist his boys in the business of destroying demons by hacking folks and burying them. Against all odds in heaven and hell it creeped me out just fine. As one of the now-grown sons (Matthew McConaughey enjoying sweat and scruffiness) narrates a complicated pattern of flashbacks to a skeptical FBI agent (Powers Boothe happily hamming it up) Paxton the actor gently embraces the role of serial killer. Paxton the director meanwhile exults in the obviousness of the genre. Frailty veers toward X-Files-style heat-and-serve weirdness then veers somewhere else. Its clunky and indie-size - yet far sturdier than its title suggests.
