Following the exhaustive movie-geek sprawl of the Kill Bill movies the crass indulgence of Death Proof and the diverting but directionless Inglourious Basterds it seemed like the ultimate fanboy had slipped into a terminal self-congratulatory decline. Well somebodys clearly rattled his cage because Django Unchained for all its digressive episodic and frequently ludicrous nature is a blazing return to form. This is a meaty spaghetti western heavy on the spicy sauce and ketchup and peppered with the sort of unforgettable touches only Tarantino could get away with. Last time around Tarantino gave the Nazi top brass what for. This time the topic for irreverent dissection is American slavery Jamie Foxx is Django freed from a chain gang by German bounty hunter Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and on a mission to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Only trouble is Hildy is owned by moustache-twirling Mississippi slavemaster Calvin Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose ugly reputation precedes him. The first thing to notice is how packed Django Unchained feels. Tarantinos love of pithy language hasnt deserted him but the dialogue never exists only for its own sake every moment feels purposeful. The second is how great it looks from the period design and incredible costumes - Foxx gets a dandyish blue silk number that could well spark a trend - to some gorgeous photography particularly of human faces this might be the directors best-looking movie.There are problems like every Tarantino film since the soulful Jackie Brown Django Unchained feels a little ersatz favouring momentary thrills over lasting emotional punch. The romance between Django and Broomhilda is talked about in epic terms but we never feel their connection while the brutal dispatch of a couple of key characters late in the day is done with cold efficiency when they deserved more. But this is a film bursting with pleasures the note-perfect performances (a director cameo aside but thats to be expected) a brace of close-to-the-bone borderline offensive moments (Samuel L Jacksons character will make jaws drop) the soaring cine-literate soundtrack the sheer relentless drive. So welcome back Quentin. All may not be forgiven quite yet but keep this up and even Death Proof may vanish in the rearview.

This film is Hollywood piffle which takes the historically significant subject of slavery and exploits it as an opportunity to wallow in gory spectacle and gun worship. What kind of an idiot thinks that a spring-loaded Derringer hidden up the sleeve is interesting plot device? Or that a 15-minute gun battle is anything other than boring? It is sad to think of the good films that could be made on this subject if funds were not being wasted on drivel like this. I give it one star to recognise the good work of the actors and production team. The script gets zero.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 4 2013Narciso FeaturedI enjoyed it and its worth the price of admission to watch. Waltz is great but DiCaprio is the main man he is a brilliant combination of charm southern manners and pure evil It went slightly of track when QT made an appearance... why? Seemed a tad indulgent on his part and that Aussie accent has be up there with the worst accents on film Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 3 2013DumDumBoyFeaturedOkay. My fault. Shouldve just waited for the DVD. Actually shouldve just waited til it showed up on TV - then wouldnt have paid at all. The Cons Overlong (by the time we reach the Tarantino-scene its a case of surely theres not more ?. Devoid of any emotion. (you dont care for anybody) Indulgent (that Tarantino scene oh boy - and dont give me any of that he knows he a shitty actor rubbish - that just ridiculous - he claims to be making a statement about slavery and in that scene he blows it) Rambling (boy does it ramble his dialogue is simply not strong enough to carry the broad brushstrokes) Imitation (its not always flattery - at some point QT HAS to find his own true voice )theres a hint of it in Jackie Brown; but hes copied all the BAD things about spaghetti westerns - even the great ones were too long rambling and featured often forgettable dialogue well done QT you paid tribute well) The violence (always partial to bloodshed but Ive always believed it should hurt - Wild Bunch it looks like it hurts. Godfather - it looks like it hurts. This? Kids playing nothing more) The Pros Leo is great. The soundtrack (got to be careful here) works - but ONLY BECAUSE IT WORKED BEFORE Lets stop all this praise for his musical choices - they are lazy - the scenes where the music works well is BECAUSE THE MUSIC WOULD WORK WELL ANYWHERE  IT""S GOOD MUSIC) Please stop giving QT credit for something even hed be hard-pushed to ruin. You want to see a great use of music - watch DRIVE watch MANHUNTER. Oh and Ive seen mention of his unique use of snowy landscapes - only unique if you choose to believe that GRAND SILENZIO and JEREMIAH JOHNSON dont exist Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 31 2013scrumpyjackFeatured1st day of release in screen 5 then 2 five days later......3rd viewing screen 1 yesterday Not seen that beforeHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 31 2013scrumpyjackFeatured1st day of release in screen 5 then 2 five days later......3rd viewing screen 1 yesterday Not seen that beforeHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 28 2013SuttonFeaturedA superb movie.

You have read all the good commentary I didnt find the film too long or violent. Each scene moved me along and I only looked away during the Mandingo fight scene. Memories of Blazing Saddles at times and the film worked better as a witty pastiche than a story to be taken seriously. I could easily see it again to enjoy more of the detailing.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 26 2013fueldragsterFeaturedA half-cooked bowl of spaghetti. By no means either the best or worst of the Tarantino films that I have seen. What to dislike Tarantinos apparently obligatory theft of music from far better westerns. The importation of Waltz (well suited to his previous role but once round the studio floor with him was enough) and the attempt to justify a reason for using him (Djangos wife having been named Broomhilda/Brunhilde ""von Shaft"") -mein Gott das ist wunderbar?. When did winchester carbines come out? What about the Remington derringer? Is this film not by definition supposed to pre-date the US civil war? (perhaps Tarantino missed an opportunity to arrange dialogue for capamp;ball reloading sessions?) What to like Samuel Jackson gives an award worthy performance as an old Silver-back his initial expressions are memorable. That the stolen music is mercifully limited to the first half. Everything else so-so adequate performances from the rest of the cast. I really do not see this film adding anything useful to a debate on slavery is the alternative negro word now supposed to be acceptable? If you want slow-motion carnage then the Wild Bunch was far better. Did I feel ripped off? Well no actually anyone who volunteers to watch one of his films must surely by now know that allowances are expected. If you liked his previous go lap it up everyone else I suggest some caution. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 24 2013critiqueFeaturedTypical Tarantino fare wordy bloody overlong funny distinctive. Waltz DiCaprio and Jackson all turn in memorable performances. Like Inglourious Basterds the film is at its best in the scenes which build up tension. Three and a half stars.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 23 2013LoulouFeaturedNow I have seen it it didnt disappoint but its not one of his best. Leo di Caprio makes a great baddie - loved Christoph Waltzs performance too. Too much theatrical blood I felt - kind of nauseating although for the most part the film did indeed look good. And you could never call QTs films boring.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 21 2013jayFeaturedFrom the opening bars of the Django theme we know we are in familiar territory for his wanton nostalgia by overly referencing other films. Tarantino known for being ill-disciplined in the editing room - which strained ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Kill Bill"" delivers a thrilling ride with more comedic moments than a Mel Brooks comedy. Top-notch performances throughout especially the reliable (Christoph Waltz) who chews up the scenery with aplomb. Foxx fits the role of the slave in search for his damsel; Dicaprio is a character with a charming brooding menace and Jackson delivers a Cheney-esque uncle Tom. My only gripe would be the peurile use of his exploitation-style of blood and carnage (I recall Corbucci or Leone not using much at all) and his willingness to offer himself a cameo; more painful this time with the inclusion of a faux Australian accent. Its taken a while but he has deliivered his best film since the under-appretiated ""Jackie Brown.""Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 20 2013LeopoldFeaturedAwsome indeed must see amp; must see again 9/10Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 20 2013LeopoldFeaturedAwsome indeed must see amp; must see again 9/10Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 20 2013scrumpyjackFeaturedI think Quint is FULLY aware of his ""shitty"" cameo.

This will be a strong come-back-film for Jamie Foxx in any case after having failing to shine in his films on the whole after getting his Best Actor Oscar for Ray quite a couple of years back. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 19 2013IanFeaturedEvery time i found myself liking the film Tarantino does something to annoy. In places it is very funny and Waltz Di Caprio and Foxx are all excellent however there are too many annoyances to make this a four star film. The violence is too extreme with too much fake blood splattered everywhere and like a few have said Tarantino and his aussie mates are a disaster. Jackson hams it up incredibly and there must have been a bet between him and Don Johnson as to who would play the biggest cliche because both are hammier than a bacon sarnie. Its enjoyable but not great and is probably 20 to 25 minutes too long. Worth 7 out of 10. Not for the weak stomached or as a date movie.

To say Death Proof is a bad movie is a joke same for Inglorious Basterds and to slate kill bill is a further joke. You sound like every other critic who sits there and just thinks its cool to slate his movies. yes you may have liked this one to some degree but to be truthful you have no idea the thought and passion that goes into it every camera angle every scene instead of just being shot to death by a DIR to get the right shot. He will be remembered as one of the best directors ever to live up there with other modern and old directors i.e Kubrick Scorsese and Nolan. Whe n he goes and stops making movies what will we be left with but over produced bull crap.

After Basterdz I was afraid this will be QTs friend playing their favorite cowboy characters but thankfully I was wrong. It is a very serious movie that meditates on American history and relationships between its citizens. I mean just take gung-ho violence seems to be in place as sort of US tradition and obsession. Film also looks great especially night scenes which seem to be lighted only by candle light. The things bothering me seems to be that some scenes were unnecessary like the part with KKK which didnt bring almost anything to the movie. But I guess its becuase Sally Menke died and she was obviously only one with authority to tell QT when to leave out a scene.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 7 2013Tom CFeaturedVery good performances but its long quite boring and needlessly violent. Its quite muddled in places and struggles to hold the audiences attention in the final third.

At area theaters. At times Quentin Tarantinos storytelling bravado and his penchant for gleefully rummaging in cinemas vaults and diving its Dumpsters have made it too easy for some to marginalize him. Hes gifted sure. Hes great at what he does. But is he important? After all he can be so flashy so movie-movie clever. He can be brazenly brutal in ways only B-movie fans love. He can also sharpen a scene within an inch of its life. Case in point the nerve-wracking exchange between a Nazi officer and a French farmer hiding his Jewish neighbors in the 2009 Holocaust revenge film ""Inglourious Basterds."" The end product may be slightly less than the sum of its scenes but oh those scenes. Genius. ""Django Unchained"" delivers a number of audacious scenes. The initial meeting of the slave Django and bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in the woods for starters. But they flow purposefully into a tale of sacrifice and courage friendship and love that finds the two men embarking on a quest to free Djangos wife from a notorious plantation called -- wait for it board-game enthusiasts -- Candyland. ""Django Unchained"" is Tarantinos most complete movie yet. It is also his most vital. His storytelling talents match the heft of the tale. Slavery is the bedeviling nasty chapter in Americas story. Tarantino crafted a parable of decency versus evil for a generation that never saw ""Roots."" Yes there will be over-the-top gore and scene-chewing work by Samuel L. Jackson who plays the more-than-trusted house slave of plantation owner Calvin Candie portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio. Not only will you not like this man you wont be able to make excuses for him. But ""Django Unchained"" is also (even at three hours) a movie that hews to its protagonists emotions. Jamie Foxx is near-perfect as Django. Hes got the muscular presence required to portray a man whos been exploited for his strength. Foxx also brings nimble understated comedic timing to the buddy-flick aspects of the outing. And he pulls off a peacock blue ensemble with ridiculous dignity. Christoph Waltz should be headed to his second Oscar nomination as Shultz. Schultz at times exhibits a cluelessness to the ways of America. Django will say as much at one point. But its his humanity that makes him a bit superior to cruelty. In many ways their quest begins with a story told near a campfire. Django talks about wife Broomhilda. The name itself stops Schultz in his tracks. She bears the name of a maiden from German legend who is imprisoned in a castle surrounded by a ring of fire. In the legend shes liberated by Siegfried. (Siegfried and Roy Rogers anyone?) They embark on their quest to gain Broomhilda her freedom. In a wink to ""Mandingo"" a 1975 exploitation flick Tarnatino knows well the pair approach plantation scion Candie with the cover that Schultz wants to get into the ""mandingo fighting"" biz. Django is a freeman there to help him scout talent for the bare-fisted to-the-death circuit. Much like ""Inglourious Basterds"" this film offers viewers a space to work through some serious pay-back fantasies. Granted most of them are more male than female. Though Kerry Washington brings to Broomhilda more depth and edge than your average damsel. Schultz is the white man who does the right thing. Indeed unlike the hero of another Civil War-era film out currently he isnt mystified by Djangos humanity. Its a given. Slaverys the thing that flummoxes him. Tarantino achieves an elegant if disturbing symmetry in pitting Django and Schultz against Candie and Stephen. They are in a fashion mirror images. Only the sight of plantation owner and slave is more distorted than a fun-house mirror. Its an image from a house of horrors.

By Anthony Lane The grandeur of ""Les Miserables"" may have confused the directors sense of scale.   Credit Illustration by Istvan Orosz The long and thunderous film of ""Les Miserables"" arises from the stage musical which itself was adapted from Victor Hugos enormous novel. Yet the story at heart is an intimate one. Valjean (Hugh Jackman) serves nineteen years for stealing a loaf of bread a punishment that he regards as unjust though in fact it reflects well on the status of French baking. Had he taken a croissant it would have meant the guillotine. In 1815 he breaks parole vanishes and emerges eight years later as a respectable factory owner and the mayor of Montreuil. There he is dimly recognized as a former convict by Javert (Russell Crowe) the local police inspector. These two cross paths for the rest of the film with Javert in panting pursuit. Would it be too fanciful to suggest that they have a thing for each other to which they never confess? That would explain why Crowe and Jackman both tough Australians are made to sing at so agonized a pitch. Crowe launches into his lusty anthems as if a platoon of infantry stationed in his immediate rear had just fixed bayonets without giving sufficient warning. Then there is a layer of lesser plots. A poor wench named Fantine (Anne Hathaway) one of Valjeans workers loses her job becomes a prostitute and dies though not before summoning enough puff to sing ""I Dreamed a Dream."" She leaves a daughter whom Valjean raises as his own. We jump to 1832 with Paris in a rebellious mood and the child Cosette (Amanda Seyfried) all grown up. She draws the gaze of Marius (Eddie Redmayne) a young hothead who in turn is the idol of his neighbor Eponine (Samantha Barks). And so the action gathers steam and comes to the barricades--or to be exact to a single barricade with an anti-monarchist uprising represented by a small group of students sitting on a pile of furniture. The director is Tom Hooper fresh from ""The Kings Speech"" and you cant help wondering if this shift into grandeur has confused his sense of scale. The camera soars on high the orchestra bellows and then whenever somebody feels a song coming on we are hustled in close forsaking our birds-eye view for that of a consultant rhinologist. The actors were recorded live as they belted out the big numbers and Hathaway in particular takes full advantage turning in precisely the sort of performance down to the last sniff that she would be the first to lampoon on ""Saturday Night Live."" Not that you can blame her. She probably took one look at the material and realized that the only way to survive it was by the naked power of oomph. I was unprepared having missed ""Les Miserables"" onstage for the remarkable battle that flames between music and lyrics each vying to be more uninspired than the other. The lyrics put up a good fight but you have to hand it to the score a cauldron of harmonic mush with barely a hint of spice or a note of surprise. Some of Hoopers cast acquit themselves with grace notably Redmayne and its a relief to see Sacha Baron Cohen in the role of a seamy innkeeper bid goodbye to Cosette with the wistful words ""Farewell Courgette."" One burst of farce however is not enough to redress the basic inflationary bombast that defines ""Les Miserables."" Fans of the original production no doubt will eat the movie up and good luck to them. I screamed a scream as time went by. The new Quentin Tarantino picture ""Django Unchained"" stars Jamie Foxx as a slave named Django and mid-nineteenth-century America as the chains. Our hero is freed by Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a bounty hunter posing as a dentist who appears to have escaped from a Bunuel film; trim of beard and florid of rhetoric he would rather die than act uncivilly and would rather kill than prolong an unsavory argument. He needs Django as a witness to identify potential targets and the pair become a team dispatching wanted men and handing over the corpses for cash. The first half of the tale is skillfully balanced the best thing that Tarantino has done since ""Jackie Brown"" and its comedy bristles with barbs. To watch a posse of marauding Klansmen hooded with white bags complain that they cant see through the eyeholes is to wish dearly that D. W. Griffith who lauded the Klan in ""The Birth of a Nation"" were at ones side. But something happens to the pace and the poise of ""Django Unchained"" as the hunters head South and the screen fills with the word ""Mississippi."" Here resides Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) slave owner brocaded fop and master of Candyland the plantation estate where his subjects toil among them Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) Djangos wife. But is Tarantino truly engaged with those subjects? He is happy to film whippings in unstinting detail or the incarceration of Broomhilda whom Django has come to save. Yet she barely exists as a character and even Django seems to morph from a near-silent sufferer into an avenging angel grinning in glory without passing through the usual stages of personhood. What really grips Tarantino is the chance to bait us as he has done before with metronomic mentions of the N-word--uttered with especial relish by Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) the majordomo of Candyland and the most terrifying of Uncle Toms. The reason for the crawl and slither of these later scenes is plain the director is coiling himself as is his wont for an apocalypse of blood. Dr. Schultz triggers it with one brief deed. ""I couldnt resist"" he says and that mix of mock-apology and merry boast is purest Tarantino. He has such a fine eye and his travelling shots of horses and riders are a hint of what tremendous cowboy flicks he might have made in a straighter age but his films continue to be snared in a tangle of morality and style. Tarantino is dangerously in love with the look of evil and all he can counter it with is cool--not strength of purpose let alone goodness of heart but simple comeuppance issued with merciless panache. That is what Django delivers and its the least that Candie deserves together with other defenders of the Southern status quo such at any rate will be the claim of Tarantinos fans although I was disturbed by their yelps of triumphant laughter at the screening I attended as a white woman was blown away by Djangos gun. By the time Tarantino shows up as a redneck with an unexplained Australian accent ""Django Unchained"" has mislaid its melancholy and its bitter wit and become a raucous romp. It is a tribute to the spaghetti Western cooked al dente then cooked a while more and finally sauced to death. Apart from a short scene at a piano recital and a bus ride home the whole of Michael Hanekes ""Amour"" unfolds inside that home. Far from being claustrophobic it is a place where happiness has taken root and bloomed a placid Parisian apartment lined with bookshelves and inhabited by Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) and his wife Anne (Emmanuelle Riva). If there is a prison here (and we should expect no less from the director of ""Funny Games"" and ""The White Ribbon"") it is that of the human body. The couple are elderly and when at breakfast Anne stops still--freeze-framed we learn by ""obstruction of the carotid""--the moment marks the start of her entrapment. In vain will she beat against the bars. To give away what happens in ""Amour"" is no big deal because it happens to everyone. It is the coming attraction that we dread and from which cinema by and large has turned its face just as Anne her condition worsening flinches from a mirror. To an extent she is lucky--she is not alone in her decline and after an operation she returns in a wheelchair to be looked after by Georges. Her movement is restricted on one side; speech falters and dies to a moan; diapers are required. He gives her spoonfuls of pureed food as if she were a child. Their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) comes to visit and the mere clop of her heels on the wooden floor spells drama and distress which exasperates her father who never weeps and who occupies himself solely with the duties of care. ""Your concern is no use to me"" he says to Eva. You know that hes right yet there is a discernible thread of steel in his attitude as sharp as the cutting of the film and what makes ""Amour"" so strong and clear is that it allows Haneke to anatomize his own severity. Anne for example used to teach piano and for a few tender seconds we see her play Schubert in Georgess imagination. Then we think of ""The Piano Teacher"" (2001) in which Hanekes heroine was led by a musical rapport into a lethal amour fou. Does the new film redeem such horror or is all beauty fated to be ominous and frail? It was a masterstroke to cast Riva whose sweetness of face and manner is as unfaded as that of any actress alive. We instinctively believe as Georges does of Anne that she should abide forever. But she will not. There have been many invasions in Hanekes work and there is indeed an attempted break-in at the start of this film but nothing compares with the looming approach of mortality. Even Georgess resources are of no avail and that is why he is forced to consider at the last gasp what love requires him to do. All amour is fou.

""Django Unchained"" feels like a three-hour trailer for a movie that never happens a slavery-revenge melodrama cum salt-n-pepper action film that would be awesome if it actually existed. Like so many trailers its packed with memorable scenes that dont go anywhere and keeps promising payoffs that remain theoretical. Its got Western scenery on a grand scale and scenes of madcap comedy involving inept members of the Ku Klux Klan. Its got veritable geysers and fountains and gushers of blood an ocean of fake gore even by Tarantinos standards. You could claim that hes ""quoting from Sam Peckinpah"" with those slapsticky water balloons full of blood except that thats not quite it. Its more like hes quoting from crappy 70s drive-in movies that were quoting from ""The Hills Have Eyes"" which was quoting from something else that was quoting from Peckinpah. (I may be missing an intermediate stage there such as a cannibal film that was dubbed from Italian into Spanish and projected once with the reels out of sequence at a downtown Los Angeles theater in 1983.)Its got 783 uses of the word ""nigger"" in dialogue which is not merely a new high in Tarantinos personal anti-P.C. campaign but may also outdo the lifetime output of former Congressman and KKK Grand Wizard David Duke. (OK I didnt count. But thats close enough.) Its got ""Mandingo fighting"" or gladiatorial combat between African-American slaves which was not something that happened in the real world but definitely happened in a notoriously dreadful 1975 movie starring James Mason a genuinely great actor who was in lots of garbage but also played the lead in Stanley Kubricks ""Lolita"" and a bad guy in Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest."" (That sentence became increasingly irrelevant but gained velocity; Im just trying to simulate Quentin Tarantinos thought process.) Its got Don Johnson. Its got black people speaking German. Well OK one black person Kerry Washington in what could maybe be called the leading female role does only three things 1) Standing in a pond in Jamie Foxxs imagination and looking alluring; 2) Lying in a hole in the ground with no clothes on; 3) Speaking German.She speaks German of course to Christoph Waltz the charismatic Viennese actor who won an Oscar working with Tarantino in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and may get nominated again this year for playing pretty much the same worldly Kraut charmer this time as a good guy. Waltz is Dr. King Schultz a German dentist turned bounty hunter in the pre-Civil War Wild West who abhors slavery but doesnt mind murder and purchases and then frees the eponymous slave Django (Foxx) in order to help him commit more of it. Im not objecting to any of that on ethical grounds or whatever but its an awfully complicated setup for two characters who never come clearly into focus and a wandering episodic narrative that takes a long time to get anywhere.If youve seen any of Tarantinos movies you dont need me to explain that he sees the universe in terms of random explosions of ruthless farcical violence. Schultz and Django eventually turn their attention to hunting down sadistic slavers and slave-owners where the moral equation seems clear enough. But they spend early portions of the movie wandering all through the West and South collecting the ""dead or alive"" bounties on wanted men whose guilt or innocence is unproven and unknown. In one scene they shoot a farmer whos plowing his field right in front of his son. I recognize the moral argument that is hypothetically percolating below ""Django Unchained"" Tarantino is suggesting that white Americans who benefited from a slave economy were guilty of historical crimes whether or not they personally owned slaves just as he implied in ""Inglourious Basterds"" that German soldiers were guilty of atrocities they did not personally commit. But give me a break. In both cases hes just pretending to raise these so-called questions in order to create the framework for an emotionally arid ultraviolent action movie whose characters and audience seem to be emotionally stunted adolescent boys. For Tarantino history is just another movie to strip for parts.I dont want to spend much time on Waltzs loquacious but cool-headed Schultz and Foxxs stone-faced Django because theyre actually pretty boring and once you get the gist - some scenery a few gentle gags then they kill a bunch of people - their journey has few surprises. ""Django Unchained"" comes abruptly to life in the last hour with the outrageous performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson as an effete Francophile plantation owner and the superficially obsequious ""house slave"" who dominates his domicile. These are powerful taboo-breaking characters with a perverse but somehow believable relationship redolent of the deep weirdness of race relations in the Old South DiCaprios poncey Van Dyke-wearing Calvin Candie is actually under the thumb of Jacksons grinning jiving Stephen (who looks almost exactly like the guy on the old Cream of Wheat box) but both are hopelessly doomed by the soul-crushing institution of white supremacy. You Might Also Like That fascinating and troubling subplot feels like it ought to be the dramatic center of ""Django Unchained"" but completely isnt. Its maddening to detect traces amid all this passionless and self-indulgent rambling of the adventurous storyteller and precise stylist who made ""Reservoir Dogs"" ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" (a film by the way that has much more to say about race as a lived experience in America than this one). Lately Tarantino appears to have drifted into the hipster equivalent of George Lucas-land where everyone around him agrees with his dumb ideas and nobody dares to observe that the movies are fatally undisciplined and way too long and not really about anything.I realize Im supposed to say something about Tarantinos use of revisionist historical fantasy -- making Jewish warriors the protagonists of World War II and inserting a black action hero into the antebellum South -- but I just dont think either of the movies is serious enough to make that a worthwhile topic. For the record The idea behind ""Inglourious Basterds"" was genuinely subversive even if the results were ludicrous but theres nothing revolutionary or new about depicting a black man as violent vengeful and monosyllabic. Its always chancy to agree with Spike Lee about anything but his recent tweet saying that he didnt see the story of his slave ancestors as a Sergio Leone movie hit home with me. Lets back up for a second and stumble over the meaningless detail that Kerry Washingtons nearly invisible character - the wife forcibly separated from Django previously slave to a German-speaking master -- is named Broomhilda von Shaft. I mean OK. But on the other hand what? Its just a gag I guess and within the movie its clear that the character is actually named after Brunnhilde the valkyrie and shield-maiden of Norse-Germanic legend who must be rescued by the hero Siegfried. But its a gag that explains a lot especially the fact that ""Django Unchained"" is full of memorable images and ideas but isnt tethered to any remotely coherent universe either historical or imaginary and the related fact that Tarantino is the kind of overamped class clown who cant help making two different totally unrelated meta-meta-meta-brain-fart 1970s jokes when hes giving a name to a character from the 1850s.Theres unquestionably an audience for the antics of the amped-up class clown especially when presented with Tarantinos undoubted cinematic verve wrapped in a nostalgia for trashy movie genres most of todays audiences have never seen and served with an overlay of progressive and/or outrageous racial politics. I understand that for many viewers the crazily overstuffed one-damn-thing-after-another quality of ""Django Unchained"" will offer a fun alternative to more predictable fare and have no doubt that some of my fellow critics will proclaim it a postmodern masterpiece equally inspired by Jean-Luc Godard the spaghetti western and the screen careers of Jim Brown Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson and whatever other ex-NFL stars of the 70s made movies in which they got to kill white people. I love to make those kinds of proclamations And that combination of ingredients sounds intriguing in theory - just about enough for a great trailer. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Django Unchained (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Django Unchained (R) Quentin Tarantinos southern-fried Western is a bloody good time. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/24/2012 Editor rating 3 Django Unchained is the most brutal film Quentin Tarantino has ever made. Unlike Kill Bill or Inglourious Basterds where the violence was thrilling and carried a visceral kick the carnage here is often ugly and difficult to watch. The movie is a western set in the antebellum South but its central subject is slavery and the unspeakable abuse of blacks in the era and Tarantino doesnt shy from coming in close to show you the details. There are sequences in the film such as a scene in which two men are forced to fight each other to the death using only their hands that are horrifying - intentionally so. But the movie is also exciting and ironic and at times explosively funny Even at his most serious Tarantino cant help but entertain and show you a good time and his cast perfectly straddles the line between drama and comedy. Jamie Foxx stars as the eponymous hero a slave purchased by Dr. King Schultz a loquacious and immensely likable German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz as sublime here as he was in Basterds). King teaches Django to stop thinking like a slave and start behaving as a free man. Django agrees to help his rescuer track down wanted men as long as they make their way to his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) who is a slave at a plantation owned by the sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Told in linear chronological fashion (unusual for Tarantino) the first half of Django Unchained is a series of shoot-outs and chases leading to Candies opulent cotton farm where we remain for most of the rest of the film. An air of stagnancy creeps in partly because the love story between Django and Broomhilda feels perfunctory and partly because DiCaprio is disappointing as the cruel and racist brat who views slaves as less than human. The actor so good at playing troubled men fares less well at radiating imperious menace. When he raises his voice he sounds like a teenager who needs to be sent to his room and he relies on his cigarette holder so much it becomes distracting -- an actors trick of incorporating a prop into a performance. DiCaprio is completely overshadowed by Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen Candies main servant a betrayer to his race who connives and betrays for the sheer fun of it. Stephen may be the most villainous of all of Tarantinos villains -- you will absolutely hate him -- and Jackson plays his evil with an operatic furor. Django Unchained has long sequences of dialogue (such as an endless dinner at the Candie mansion) that lack the tension and suspense of similar scenes in Inglourious Basterds At two hours and 45 minutes the movie drags and a superfluous scene (featuring an unfortunate cameo by Tarantino) begs to have been excised. But all is forgiven by the time the movie reaches its insanely bloody climax (none of that sissy CGI gore here) a supremely satisfying dose of payback that earns Django his heroic dimensions. Django Unchained may be too graphic for sensitive viewers -- Tarantino makes a point of showing you the darkest aspects of slavery -- and too talky for impatient ones. But the movie works despite its flaws another in the directors numerous tales of revenge that mixes genres and history to create a western youve never seen before.

Starring Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio Director Quentin Tarantino Running time 245 Release Opened Dec 25 2012  Editorial Review A slaves insurrection captured by TarantinoBy Ann HornadayTuesday December 25 2012Theres something perversely appropriate about Quentin Tarantinos ""Django Unchained"" being released the same year as ""Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter"" and Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" -- one of which takes brazen creative liberties with history one thats far more prudent in its license-taking but both of which in their own way reanimated Civil War-era America in exhilarating ways. ""Django Unchained"" breathes its own refreshing occasionally demented life into that time period albeit in a pulpy stylized cinematic language more akin to vampire-hunter cartoonishness than ""Lincolns"" more classical reserve. But the art of creative anachronism Tarantino practices in this extravaganza of Southern gothic camp is far more successful than 2009s ""Inglourious Basterds"" in meaningfully engaging the history its repurposing. Where ""Basterds"" was little more than a larky speculative burlesque ""Django Unchained"" possesses an unmistakable subversive power its playfully insurrectionist spirit perhaps the modern-day pop-culture equivalent of far more high stakes rebellions of yore. Theres a point in ""Django Unchained"" when its sheer absurdity luridness and violence pose an inescapable challenge to the skeptical literalists in the audience Sure this is an outrageous distortion the ""Django Unchained"" movie itself seems to say but is it any more outrageous than ""The Birth of a Nation"" or ""Gone With the Wind""? Even as he liberally peppers his dialogue with racial epithets (spoken as often as not by an imperious house servant named Stephen played by a prosthetically aged Samuel L. Jackson) Tarantino doesnt shrink from the inhumane realities of life for enslaved people in 19th century America One of the first shots of the film captures the horrifically scarred backs of several men as theyre force-marched through the Texas countryside on a chain gang. Thats where the title character (Jamie Foxx) meets an itinerant dentist named Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who turns out to be a bounty hunter on a job. Django assures Schultz that he can identify the three men Schultz is looking for and agrees to help him if Schultz will in turn help him find his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Full of the campy signifiers of the 1970s exploitation genre Tarantino worships so lavishly ""Django Unchained"" opens with a big overproduced theme song eventually becoming a spaghetti Western in the tradition of Franco Nero (who has a bit role). Fully kitted out in low-crowned hat holster and menacing slouch Django comes to resemble Nat Turner by way of Clint Eastwood an archetypal vigilante radically redefined across the ages. ""Kill white folks and they pay you for it?"" he asks when Schultz suggests he become a bounty hunter too. ""Whats not to like?"" The most recognizable elements of Tarantinos style are all on full florid display the self-conscious talk-talk-talk interrupted by spasms of graphic cruelty and gore; the poppy color and visual wit (Schultzs carriage is topped by a tooth on a spring that bounces back and forth like a childs toy); the nods and winks at grindhouse schlock gone by. ""Django Unchained"" might raise questions about whether Tarantino is trading in the very brand of voyeuristic exploitation hes critiquing as in a scene when a plantation owner named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) watches two enslaved men ""Mandingo fighting."" But later when he shows a man being castrated the scene plays less like a cheap stunt than a weirdly honest confrontation with a painful unresolved past. And in spite of his own tendency to put everything in quotation marks Tarantino creates images of real power and beauty such as when a spray of blood stains the lily-white bolls of a cotton field. (He also knows that ridicule sometimes has more throw-weight than rage such as in a hilarious sequence featuring the Ku Klux Klan that hoists the terrorist organization on its own pathetic petard.) For viewers who already share Tarantinos love of genre ""Django Unchained"" is -- at least for its first two hours -- enormously satisfying. Waltz who won an Oscar for his depiction of a depraved Nazi in ""Inglourious Basterds"" plays the good guy here to similarly potent effect and DiCaprio tucks into his characters effete venality with scenery-chewing relish. But colorful characters and performances can only mask thinly schematic underpinnings for so long. Eventually Tarantino resorts to his usual fall-back position which is to bathe everything and everyone in sight in gunfire gore and geysers of blood. ""Django Unchained"" goes out on a furious tide of retributive carnage with its rapacious fops and spitting slack-jawed yokels learning -- seemingly for a good 30 minutes -- that paybacks a stone bummer. Catharsis is all but impossible in the face of Tarantinos own notorious self-indulgence His love of a good bloodbath finally negates the admittedly exaggerated but brutally vivid truths hes evoked. Theres an infectious unfettered fearlessness to ""Django Unchained"" that makes it enormous fun to watch but even the most soaring ode to liberation can benefit from some restraint. Contains strong graphic violence throughout a vicious fight profanity and some nudity.

RELATED NEWS Goodykoontz interviews Tarantino Spotlight Quentin Tarantino Goody blog Tarantino on violence Listen Up Django Unchained soundtrack By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Mon Dec 24 2012 427 PM The name of the movie is ""Django Unchained"" but for all practical purposes it might as well be called ""Tarantino Unleashed.""Whatever you like or hate or like and hate about Quentin Tarantinos movies is in full display here. Its long (too long) and bloody profane and gleeful with movie-genre references stuffed so tightly into each scene they practically spill out onto the theater floor.Restraint is not his strong suit.Entertainment is and ""Django"" has plenty of that.Its a buddy film a slavery epic a revenge fantasy and a spaghetti Western for starters. If that sounds like its all too much it is really. But its packaged as such a loving tribute to film its impossible not to enjoy it.We first meet Django (Jamie Foxx) as he is trudging across Texas chained to other slaves. Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) arrives and buys Django then frees him. It turns out Schultz has given up his dentistry practice for something more lucrative. Hes a bounty hunter.And he thinks Django should be one too. It doesnt take a lot of convincing. Kill White people? And get paid for it? Hes in.The first hour or so is a buddy movie and a funny one as Schultz teaches Django the tools of the trade. Djangos a genius with a gun which comes in handy. He doesnt flinch when it comes to gunning down a man wanted dead or alive another important skill.Then the two travel to Mississippi in hopes of freeing Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) Djangos wife who was bought and separated from him. She was bought by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) owner of the infamous Candieland his plantation where he hosts bloody fights between slaves among other things.Schultz has a grand scheme that involves convincing Candie that Django is an expert when it comes to slave fighters (he is not). Foxx is outstanding as Django plays a role that as Schultz puts it he has to play to perfection if they are going to free Broomhilda and no small thing stay alive themselves.Thats classic Tarantino making storytelling a crucial element of survival. Win over your audience and you live. Fail to connect and youre dead.But youll have to work your way through showers of blood and gore and hideous violence to find that. Really brutal stuff men being torn apart by dogs things like that. And yes there is gratuitous use of the N-word. Tarantino has said that he is simply depicting life as it was lived in the antebellum South. That might be true but it doesnt make it any easier to watch.Of course thats his point.There are many things to like about ""Django."" Again Foxx is tremendous; as Django he plays his role so well we begin to question if even he knows where to draw the line. Waltz who won an Oscar for his work in ""Inglourious Basterds"" may recite Tarantinos cleverer-than-thou dialogue better than anyone. DiCaprio unflinching in his depiction of sadism is effective. And Samuel L. Jackson plays a scheming house slave at Candieland with enormous relish. Yet Im not sure it all comes to much. If its meant as a meditation on the evils of slavery well most meditations arent conducted at heavy-metal volume. Tarantino definitely means to show us not just tell us how horrific the practice was. (In that regard Jacksons character while funny may be the most damaged. Others have lost life and limb; hes lost his soul.)He does that. But is having Django go all Dirty Harry on slave owners the best way to exact revenge? Revenge isnt the destination after all. Its only a sidestep on the way to real reform.Dont misunderstand ""Django Unchained"" is a really good movie that thinks its a great one. Tarantino capable of the latter should know the difference.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Photo The Weinstein Company Django Unchained review Sweet revenge 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Django Unchained Comedy-drama. Starring Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio Samuel L. Jackson and Kerry Washington. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. (R. 165 minutes.) Quentin Tarantino has once again found an appropriate channel for his aggression. In ""Inglourious Basterds"" he took his bloodlust out on Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany who couldnt have deserved it more and now in ""Django Unchained"" he takes care of that whole slavery thing going on in the South 150 years ago. Along the way he casually demolishes a movie myth stretching back to ""Gone With the Wind"" and beyond about upright masters and genteel plantation living. ""Django Unchained"" is the most consistently entertaining movie of 2012. Its 165 minutes long and shouldnt be a minute shorter a film of surprises both in story and in casting and of moments of agonizing teased-out tension. The dialogue is dazzling. Tarantino knows how to savor a good scene. He also knows where the good scenes are and by now hes developed a repertory company of actors who can pitch their performances right on that Tarantino border between real and unreal farce and tragedy. Perhaps the best thing to be said for ""Django Unchained"" is that it shows that ""Inglourious Basterds"" was no anomaly. Tarantino leaped forward in that film - in his ability skill meaning and purpose - and he gives nothing back with ""Django."" He has found that elusive spot that all artists strive for complete spontaneity and absolute control. Violent nightmare A good example of this is the form the movie takes that of a spaghetti Western. The choice might at first seem merely impulsive or playful - Tarantino loves spaghetti Westerns so he turned this story into one. He added the zoom shots and the clanging soundtrack. He saturated the colors in the frame and dressed his actors in outfits that look Western and yet a little off like an Italian dream of America. By itself that would be only mildly interesting but in context its illuminating. Tarantino is showing that the world slaves inhabited was nothing like conventional drama nothing like the consoling movies weve all seen before. It was more like an amoral violent nightmare with little recourse and no justice. Christoph Waltz who vaulted to fame in ""Inglourious Basterds"" is back in ""Django"" and if there is any sweeter music in the modern cinema than Waltz speaking Tarantinos dialogue I havent heard it. Lethal fastidious and eerily polite Waltz plays a German dentist turned bounty hunter who teams up with a slave Django - a restrained charismatic Jamie Foxx - to hunt down slave masters and overseers who are wanted by the law. Dr. Schultz (Waltz) is a supporting role but he is in most scenes and its a character with a lot of depth and shadings - brave but not fearless; self-interested but with a conscience someone who gets to grow. Waltz responds with yet another great performance. Moral abomination Django and Schultzs early adventures include an interlude at a plantation with Don Johnson as the impeccably coiffed lord of the manner. But the film soon shakes down as the story of Django and Schultzs efforts to rescue Djangos wife (Kerry Washington) from an even worse environment the sprawling Mississippi plantation owned and run by the happy sadistic Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). Tarantino films the white Candie mansion standing alone and surrounded by cultivated fields in a way that doesnt suggest taste but colossal presumption and delusion. Its as vulgar an imposition on the physical landscape as Candie is on the human one. The year is 1858 five years before Emancipation but the end of slavery feels as far away here as the end of communism did in ""The Lives of Others."" As devised by Tarantino and played with relish by DiCaprio Candie is a moral abomination whose favorite recreation is to pit two slaves against each other and have them fight to the death. Such a person wont respond to reason - Django and Schultz have to trick him into doing the right thing which wont be easy with his faithful house slave looking after him. The casting of Samuel L. Jackson as the house slave - the smiling old servant who says ""Yes boss"" and loves his master above all things - was inspired. At first the incongruousness is laugh-out-loud funny. Jackson is the last actor youd imagine in the role. And yet who but someone as shrewd and ruthless as Jackson (at least Jackson as he appears in movies) would have risen to the most cushy and responsible job available to him? In ""Django Unchained"" Tarantino rewrites the house slave forever not as a willing victim but as the one truly evil slave on the plantation. Its about time The violence is outsize epic enormous bloody - but not disturbing and not dehumanizing. Theres a place for violence onscreen and this is the place a Quentin Tarantino movie thats rated R. Just as there was nothing dispiriting about watching Hitler get his in ""Inglourious Basterds"" - it was about time - the same could be said for the events in ""Django Unchained."" And if next time around Tarantino wants to give it to the Spanish Inquisition he deserves our full support. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 24 2012 610 PM Django Unchained I laughed I was bored. I pumped my fist I felt nauseated. By Dana Stevens Django Unchained Quentin Tarantinos blaxploitation spaghetti western about a freed slave turned bounty hunter provoked a lot of contradictory feelings in me including some that dont usually come in pairs Hilarity and boredom. Aesthetic delight and physical nausea. Fist-pumping righteousness and vague moral unease. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Of course provoking intense feelings is what Tarantinos cinema is all about. The 49-year-old eternal wunderkind has always been a provocateur a creator of over-the-top multi-genre spectaculars that are as cinematically sophisticated as they can be ideologically crude. But with his last two films--Inglourious Basterds which rewrote the ending of World War II as an apocalyptic Jewish revenge fantasy and Django Unchained which performs an analogous sleight of hand on the institution of American slavery--Tarantino ups the ante. Now hes drawing his inspiration not only from movie history--the mob dramas martial-arts films and grade-B exploitation flicks hes always drawn on for his ingenious style pastiches--but from history itself. That shift in source material seems in itself worthy of pausing to note. Does his choice to plumb the past for painful ideologically loaded stories of racial and ethnic violence suggest that Tarantino is maturing as a filmmaker opening out from the stylized self-referentiality of his early films onto a broader historical perspective? And if it doesnt--if Tarantino really is just appropriating world-historical atrocities for no other reason than their power to make audiences sweat and squirm and root for the long-suffering good guys to finally for the love of God kick the bad guys Nazi/slave-trading asses--should that matter? Does Django Unchained need to have anything more on its mind than the unleashing of gleefully gory racial retribution? Advertisement A legend places the movies opening in Texas in 1858 two years before the beginning of the Civil War. A band of slaves shackled at the ankle makes its way through the night driven by two white traders. Suddenly a curious sight comes into view A horse-drawn-carriage topped by a bouncing wooden tooth and driven by a German emigre King Schultz (Christoph Waltz jovially stealing every scene hes in) whos posing as an itinerant dentist. In fact King is a bounty hunter on business for the U.S. government. Hes looking for a particular slave Django (a steely Jamie Foxx) to help him identify his next targets the notoriously pitiless slave overseers the Brittle brothers. In no time Schultz has bought Django his liberty tossed the remaining slaves the key to their shackles and made short work of the unlucky traders. With Django posing as his valet Schultz locates the Brittles who it turns out are the same heartless bastards who earlier separated Django from his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Schultz strikes a deal with the wary Django If hes willing to ride north and bounty-hunt by Schultzs side through the winter in the spring theyll head south together to find and rescue Broomhilda. After an irresistibly loopy montage set to Jim Croces ""I Got a Name"" in which the two bounty hunters ride through Marlboro-country backdrops felling wanted criminals and practicing target shooting on snowmen we move to Mississippi where theyve tracked Broomhildas whereabouts to Candieland a plantation belonging to the decadent sadistic and obscenely rich Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio in an enjoyably florid mustache-twirling performance). Candies hobby is ""mandingo fighting"" the practice of siccing two unarmed black men on one another and forcing them to fight to the death. (Theres one long horrifying scene in which we witness the sport in action; I cant speak with authority as to how gory it got in the end because I could only watch through a latticework of fingers.) Django and Schultz pose as mandingo traders in order to infiltrate the plantation and help Broomhilda escape--but its not easy to get past Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) Candielands eagle-eyed ""house nigger"" (if that job description makes you uncomfortable get used to it; in Django Unchained the n-word is ubiquitous in the mouths of both black and white actors). I wish the complex enmity between Django and Stephen--the fiercely self-reliant freed slave and the servile self-loathing Uncle Tom--had been the dramatic focus of this middle section. Instead the movie founders into theatricality with a way-too-long dinner sequence replete with death threats double-crosses and impromptu phrenology lectures. The last hour and a half of Django Unchained sometimes seems like Tarantinos extended experiment in blood-splatter painting. How would a burst of arterial blood look spraying across a horses flank? Over a field of unpicked cotton? Onto the white carnation in a dandys buttonhole? If you unproblematically loved Inglourious Basterds with its multiple endings that nested one gory act of take-that-you-Nazis retribution inside another you will probably dig the final stretch of Django Unchained. I wont spoil who does what to whom save to say that lots of bad fates are visited upon lots of bodies (some of which get torn apart alive by dogs or continue to be shot at close range many many times after theyre dead). The rhythm begins to stagger as Tarantino cant resist topping his first bloodbath shootout with a second more comic more virtuosic bloodbath shootout or flashing back to that earlier dog-mauling scene just in case wed forgotten. Tarantinos intent may have been to showcase the horrors of slavery but theres something about his directorial delectation in all these acts of racial violence that left me not just physically but morally queasy. His fascination with repeated acts of graphic retribution puts the viewer in the position of Calvin J. Candie watching with a cigarette holder and a coconut drink in hand as the mandingoes fight it out. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption The Weinstein Company Django Unchained Director Quentin Tarantino Genre Action Running time 165 minutes Rated R for strong graphic violence throughout a vicious fight language and some nudity With Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio (Recommended) Watch Clips Sure Its Her Sure Its Her Credit The Weinstein Company Im Curious Im Curious Credit The Weinstein Company Theres a wordless sequence in Quentin Tarantinos anti-bigotry neo-Spaghetti Western exploitation comedy Django Unchained in which Jamie Foxx as recently freed slave Django hitches up his horse and along with the man who bought him his freedom -- Christoph Waltzs Dr. King Schultz -- sets off on an elegiac amble through a snowy western landscape. Its one of the most gorgeous sequences of any film this year a reverie borrowed with love from rare snowscape Westerns like McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Sergio Corbuccis 1968 The Great Silence. The beauty of that scene may get lost amid the debate of how many times the n-word is used in Tarantinos script. But it shouldnt. Django Unchained is by turns exhilarating hilarious horrifying and poetic. In other words its a picture thats full of everything and if it takes significant liberties with history (as Inglorious Basterds so gleefully did) it also faces certain historical truths head-on. And the harsh reality is that a word thats never used today in polite company was in 1858 used by all manner of people who fancied themselves polite. One of those people is a central character in Django Unchained a gentleman plantation owner (and thus slave owner) named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose syrupy civility barely disguises his cruel streak. Candie it turns out owns the woman who is Djangos wife a German-speaking beauty named Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). (You were warned that Django Unchained is among many other things a comedy.) King Schultz is a bounty hunter who originally bought -- in a manner of speaking -- Djangos freedom to enlist his help in tracking down certain criminals. But as the two work together their bond deepens and he agrees to help Django free Broomhilda from Candies clutches. As with most Tarantino movies the plot mechanics are merely things on which to hang the dialogue and action like the sturdy branches of a Christmas tree. Django Unchained doesnt skimp in either of those areas. The banter between King Schultz and Django is relaxed and jovial but theres an acid edge to it too -- both of these men know theyre fighting a losing battle though the pictures shootout finale is triumphant in its own way. Tarantino and his cinematographer Robert Richardson map out the action -- and the violence -- with conscientious clarity; when theres a man down you always have at least some sense of where the bullet came from. Some of the violence in Django Unchained is raw and brutal as dictated by the exploitation-movie conventions Tarantino is riffing on here. But hes acutely sensitive about what he chooses to show When a slave for whom Candie has no use is torn apart by dogs the barbarity takes place off-camera. That doesnt diminish the horror of the moment; if anything it casts it in sharper relief. Just what is Tarantino trying to prove with Django Unchained? His aim it seems is to both provoke and delight -- hes firing on all cylinders here. The picture is a rousing good time but there are strong threads of anger in it too. Like the Spaghetti Westerns and 70s blaxploitation pictures from which it takes its cues its a form of kicking and screaming against social injustice. (The title and Foxxs character name is a mini tribute to Sergio Corbuccis 1966 vengeance spectacle Django starring Franco Nero who has a small cameo here.) Django confronts Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) the man who owns his wife. Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Co. hide caption toggle caption Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Co. The idea isnt just ""slavery was bad."" The overarching point is that old ideas of inferiority linger despite the fact that we all think we know better. When Django and King Schultz (who might also be called Dr. King if youre looking for symbolism) ride up together to any house or into any town onlookers -- both black and white -- view Django with suspicion. What they want to know is a black man doing riding a horse? Most malicious of all is Stephen the character played by Samuel L. Jackson who has made his life extremely comfortable by positioning himself as Candies favored servant. Jacksons performance is overly cartoonish even in the context of a somewhat cartoonish movie but the idea behind it -- that racial resentments arent always rendered solely in black and white -- is pointed and precise. But Django Unchained isnt a screed. Theres too much joy in it for that and both Foxx and Waltz revel in their roles. Waltz is superb here; his Schultz is gloriously understated in the way he deflects the amorality around him and his clipped diction is itself a brilliant type of comic timing. And Foxx is terrific precisely because hes so unflashy; his Django is a man who cant believe the new life hes been given and doesnt take it for granted for a second. You see that more in Foxxs eyes than in any line of dialogue. Its telling that the source music used in the movies snowy interlude in which Foxx and Waltz pick through those rugged frosty mountain trails on horseback is Jim Croces ""Ive Got a Name"" a song that many of us long ago left on the scrapheap of Top 40 radio. But Tarantino uses the song with pure love devoid of irony. (One of Tarantinos strong suits is that he doesnt love things ironically.) And in the context of a stylized adventure about a freed slave the lines ""Ive got a name/And I carry it with me like my daddy did/But Im living the dream that he kept hid"" mean something beyond 70s hit-parade nostalgia. In the course of his career Tarantino has been both praised and ridiculed for his penchant for recontextualization. At this stage of the game he does it better than anybody.

"Tarantino blows up the spaghetti western in Django Unchained - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Tarantino blows up the spaghetti western in Django Unchained Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 12.27.12 | 449 PM In ""Django Unchained"" Jamie Foxx plays Django a black slave purchased for about a hundred dollars and freed by a German dentist and bounty hunter named Schultz (Christoph Waltz). A straightforward treatment might have involved having the slave run away north. But the movie Quentin Tarantino has written and directed is corkscrewed inside-out upside-down simultaneously clear-eyed and completely out of its mind. Django is married. He and his wife (Kerry Washington) were savagely lacerated and separately sold. Hes not free until she is. So he works as the bounty hunters sidekick with the bounty hunter agreeing to help him find the wife and rescue her from a Mississippi plantation. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Set in 1858 this isnt a runaway narrative. Its a run-toward narrative rigged for shock. Each scene lays a stick of dynamite and lights a fuse that runs down and down and down until the whole thing blows up like the Fourth of July. Ive never seen anything like this movie not in one 165-minute sitting not from a single director not made with this much conscientious bravado and unrelenting tastelessness -- this much exclamatory kitsch -- on a subject as loaded gruesome and dishonorable as American slavery. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Tarantino has never been more himself than he is here. The movie is absurdly violent. When a slave owner is shot up in the opening minutes the blood doesnt splatter. It splashes like a bowling ball that fell 50 feet into a full bathtub. The films assortment of snipings bludgeonings and massacres dont stoop to Tarantinos typical fatuousness. Almost every corpse wears a principled toe-tag of vengeance. Tarantino has also never pushed himself as he does here to understand what it would mean to harness his cinematic promiscuity to merge the properties of the spaghetti western the blaxploitation movie the Hollywood prestige picture broad satire and high romance into a movie whose resulting taxonomy is simply Tarantino. The first half of the film is a kind of buddy-movie picaresque in which Django and Schultz traverse the country picking off wanted men and sharing the payday. A comic upside of Djangos freedom is going from rags to ruffles and electric blue knee pants and a matching cutaway jacket. He looks like something from the Andre 3000 Little Lord Fauntleroy collection. Schultz schools Django in the ways of the marksman while Django grips his freedom tight. The astonished stares of other slaves and their white owners seem to embolden Django say to lash the white brothers who whipped him and his wife. The sustained climax is set in and around the Mississippi plantation that ensnares Djangos wife Broomhilda a beauty who speaks fluent German. To gain entry he and Schultz concoct a scheme in which they gain favor with the plantation owner a flamboyant priss named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) by pretending to be a pair of slave traders shopping for brutes to win the bare-knuckle death matches plantation owners were known to stage for their private entertainment. The prospect of being a black ""slaver"" as Django puts it nauseates him. But by this point hes so close to Broomhilda that he holds his breath and commits to the ruse. Tarantino raises the stakes by naming the brawls Mandingo fights a reference to a 37-year-old plantation-bound cult-movie provocation full of interracial lust a boxing slave and the salty ham of James Mason. Tarantino stages his own such fight in the parlor of Candies Cleopatra Club and its the most brutal scene hes ever devised which for him is really saying something. The black people in the room cant bring themselves to watch. But Candie becomes increasingly unhinged with exhilaration. DiCaprio has never been afraid to try anything. Still this is the loosest and weirdest hes allowed himself to be. The movies a hard mix of meticulous cartoonishness and unexpected power. In order for it to work emotionally you have to believe in Django and Broomhilda beyond Foxx and Washingtons sexiness. You have to feel that theyre two halves of one heart. Tarantino shows them fleeing together in a flashback shot in greens and blues and over-saturated (the rest of the movie is scarlet and sunny; its warm). Theyre holding hands running pursued across an open field. The image of Washingtons anguished face hovers onscreen and if these are the images that haunt Django theyre also images that haunt us. We want him to find her because its romantic but also because its just. That sequence is as close as Tarantino will ever come to oblique passion of Toni Morrison. He knows what the stakes are and keeps finding clever ways to raise them. They dont get much higher -- or lower perhaps -- than Stephen the head servant at the Candie mansion. He gets a load of Django turns defensive then smells a rat. Samuel L. Jackson plays crusty waxen Stephen as a vision of depraved loyalty and bombastic jive that cuts right past the obvious association with Uncle Tom. The movie is too modern for what Jackson is doing to be limited to 1853. Hes conjuring the house Negro yes but playing him as though he were Clarence Thomas or Alan Keyes or Herman Cain or Michael Steele men whom some black people find embarrassing. For years Jackson has been enabling Tarantino to fancy himself this honorary negro. Jackson can deliver the n-word and other profanities with ketchup mustard and relish. Its the same here. That word might be fired off more than any bullet. But Jackson is going for something thats different from the sleazebag he played in Tarantinos ""Jackie Brown."" The white vileness in ""Django Unchained"" is one thing -- its stock even DiCaprios psychological version of it -- but Jacksons is what sticks with you. Weve never seen as life-size a black monster as this not even in D.W. Griffith. Jackson turns the volume way up on his entire persona to broadcast the nightmare of black self-loathing. Its a terrifying fearless and easily misconstrued performance. That kind of acting makes it easy to overlook what Foxx pulls off. Its a hard part. Django is the moral and emotional core of this movie the human force that keeps the whole thing from sliding into kitsch. Theres a gravitas to Foxx now that commands your attention. He likes the comedy of the part -- the way Django saunters on a horse in that Fauntleroy getup for instance. But mostly Django is forced to keep his head down or look away from atrocity and you can feel Foxx smolder while the character buries his dignity in order to reclaim it. The subtlety of that achievement might go unnoticed in a movie that culminates in an orgy of guns and blood. Tarantinos increasingly sophisticated idea and filmmaking are also easily reduced by the minds of some moviegoers. I really like ""Django Unchained"" but I didnt like watching it amid the moronic laughter of some of his movie-geek fans. Thats the fascinating danger of Tarantinos revisionism. Theres more than one way to love it. No filmmaker gives you as much as gleefully as he does. Hes 49 now and theres a new maturity in his style. His interests havent changed but his attention to craftsmanship as both a screenwriter and conjurer of images is stronger without sacrificing any of the thematic ludicrousness of his imagination. Waltz is his stand-in here and for the first 70 minutes or so you can tell Tarantinos so proud of what hes written for the stand-in to say. Tarantino is making the same shift that the great modern Hollywood directors (Spielberg Scorsese Eastwood) have from childish things to Important subject matter -- WWII and the Nazis in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and now the Deep South and slavery. But hes different from the directors  who brag about coming up through say Roger Corman but whose movies gradually achieve a tastefulness that has nothing to do with a movie like ""Caged Heat"" or ""Cockfighter."" Tarantino is a generation younger than Spielberg and Scorsese. He didnt come up through Corman. Corman comes out through him. Tarantinos gutter tastes are immune to the pieties and sentimentality of so-called prestige moviemaking. He likes the mess and slop and spatter of the movies the splash of a bloodbath. Youre drenched in guts and acting and wizardly dialogue in Tarantinos now peerless gusto in his talent for tonal conflation in gags and and gotcha suspense. Youre also awash in his shortcomings. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is naive revenge-revisionism exhilarating because its angry but appalling because its crude. Slavery is a more forgiving milieu for Tarantinos revenge fantasias. Hes set ""Django Unchained"" before the Civil War and clears a space that gives him room to bend history without breaking it. This film also reimagines rebellion but its wisely wrapped in the personal straits of a husband and a wife. Tarantino is young enough not to rue the past. Hes angry enough to toy with and immolate it. This time he manages not to cheapen that historys wounds -- his characters wear them. He manages to recast the Hollywood guilt so foreign to him. Schultz tells Django ""Ive never given anyone their freedom before and now that I have I feel responsible for you."" But Tarantino knows the history of race in the movies well enough to understand how nauseating a sentiment that is. Django takes care of himself. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

(AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Andrew Cooper SMPSP File) Django Unchained Django Unchained is Tarantino unleashed By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Dec 24 2012 (...) Andrew Cooper SMPSP Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio star in the film ""Django Unchained"" directed by Quentin Tarantino. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company Andrew Cooper SMPSP File) Early in Steven Spielbergs ""Lincoln"" a young African-American soldier meets the president of the United States on a bloody battlefield and starts reciting the Gettysburg Address like James Earl Jones. Late in Quentin Tarantinos ""Django Unchained"" an elderly African-American house-servant meets a freed slave at a soon-to be-bloody plantation and starts swearing like Samuel L. Jackson.Both of these scenes are rooted in make-believe but only Tarantino dares to entertain us by flaunting his falsehoods. ""Django Unchained"" is outrageous in the best sense of the word a diabolical action-comedy about cleansing the stain on the American soul.From the first moments of the film -- a retro studio logo followed by a heroic theme song and a scrolling red title that evokes the opening of ""Gone With the Wind"" -- we know we are in Tarantinos universe where the floss of film history gets spun into gold. This is his homage to spaghetti Westerns that phenomenon of the 60s and 70s when European directors such as Sergio Leone heisted a Hollywood genre to dissect its assumptions about good and evil.The stranger who waylays a Texas chain gang seems like the embodiment of eccentric menace a dandy with a German accent and a giant jiggling tooth atop his wagon like a gangstas dashboard idol. As he explains to a white overseer he is a dentist-turned-bounty-hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz deserving another Oscar). Undoubtedly Tarantino knows that the name evokes not just the American civil rights leader but the German word for ""debt collector."" Schultz has come to buy and free a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) who can identity the fugitive flesh peddlers who shipped him to Texas. The wary Django agrees on the condition that Schultz reunite him with his wife who is now living at a South Carolina plantation called Candieland. Tarantino has compared this road movie to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and the buddies trek across Marlboro vistas to the tune of Jim Croces ""I Got a Name"" is the closest thing to poignancy in the directors canon. Just as the gun-slinging Schultz is more fair-minded than he initially seems the unschooled Django grows into a formidably complex character through vestments vocabulary and finally violence against his enemies.Notwithstanding the ghoulish laughs in Tarantinos razor-sharp screenplay particularly a scene in which hooded vigilantes bicker about wardrobe malfunctions this is a righteous revenge movie. The embodiment of racist evil is Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candie (another name with layered meanings). Candie is a farmer phrenologist and fight promoter who is puzzled by the traveling strangers who arrive at his plantation to buy the field-hand Hilda (Kerry Washington). But kindly old caretaker Stephen (Jackson) knows a rat when he smells one and his suspicion that Hilda and Django knew each other at another plantation fuels a fiery shoot-out.With a fearless director and his mighty pen freeing a talented cast to attack a vital theme ""Django Unchained"" is damnation unleashed.{amp;rule}What ""Django Unchained""  Four stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 245  Content Graphic violence throughout strong language and nudity Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

For every reason I find to love it I find another reason why it gives me the creeps.No movie can match Quentin Tarantinos spaghetti Western/blaxploitation/southern when it comes to illustrating the carnage wrought by slavery. Thats significant and in some ways admirable. Crazy as it seems America still hasnt really dealt with its original sin.Im just not sure a splatter-heavy grindhouse homage is a good way to do it not even for a man whose work equals the sum of his passions for trashy movies. Theres a fine line between empowerment and exploitation and Django bludgeons that line with a cinematic sledgehammer.First the empowerment. Jamie Foxx stars as the title character a slave purchased by a wily German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz brilliant as always). Dr. King Schultz wants Django to help him find and kill a trio of slave-owning brothers. The two hit it off and the German agrees to take Django under his wing and help him rescue his enslaved wife (Kerry Washington barely used).Like Inglourious Basterds Tarantinos acclaimed scalp-the-Nazis spectacle Django is a revenge fantasy. It asks us to cheer as a black man and his trusty white hombre wreak bloody havoc on the slaver class. Not a difficult idea to get behind especially when its pulled off with such technical panache. (Shot by three-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Richardson Django is a flat-out gorgeous movie.)Thing is in order to get us worked into a bloodthirsty lather the movie feels the need to serve up some really nasty stuff. One slave plunges a hammer into anothers head in a sort of gladiatorial battle royal with some basis in reality. Another is torn apart by wild dogs.Was slavery this violent? Of course it was. Do you get the sense Tarantino gets off on showing this stuff? You bet. As Chinatowns Jake Gittes might say its his metier. Tarantino has absorbed and come to worship all manner of shock cinema; its his way of confronting the world a world that has contained and will continue to contain unspeakable atrocity.My primary issue with Django Unchained is a question of means to an end. Is it cool to look at slavery through a gory funhouse prism? Tarantino seems to think so and judging from the copious Oscar talk surrounding Django hes not alone.His skill is unquestioned. Django Unchained finds Tarantino mixing high drama with queasy humor as only he can. You know those long unbearably tense centerpiece scenes in Inglourious Basterds? Django has a couple of those including one involving Leonardo DiCaprio as a mustache-twirling plantation honcho. Parts of Django Unchained are as good as anything Ive seen this year.Other parts resonate like a sadistic joke especially once Samuel L. Jackson enters doing borderline minstrel and foiling the heroes plans as the house slave from hell. Yes the real villain in a movie about slavery is black and his (and the movies) favorite word is used liberally enough to give Spike Lee an apoplectic fit. Historically accurate? Sure. Piled on past the point of superfluous? Absolutely.Finally theres this At 165 minutes Django Unchained is about an hour too long. As the bullets keep piercing flesh tearing apart some very precious male organs on more than one occasion the movie is ultimately punishing. By the time it ended I knew Id never seen anything quite like it. Merry Christmas.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.Django Unchained(B) Directed by Quentin Tarantino.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Quentin Tarantino has devoted the last decade to meticulously crafting enormously satisfying B-movie revenge fantasies for sexy women (Kill Bill Death Proof) Jews (Inglourious Basterds) and now with his explosive slavery-themed Western Django Unchained African-Americans. In the films of Tarantinos revenge collection a noble desire to cinematically right (or re-write) historical wrongs mingles with and mutates more problematic impulses toward exhibitionism sensationalism voyeurism fetishism and exploitation. In film after film Tarantino combines aggressively combustible elements--racism sexism profanity hard drugs violence against women rape Nazi brutality slavery--with the deranged delight of a mad scientist then cackles with glee as he lights a flame and watches the magnificent destruction that ensues. Tarantino remains an entertainer above all else so his lurid provocations are generally in service of the intense emotions he forcefully confidently orchestrates. Part of his genius in manipulating audiences lies in creating immersive cinematic experiences so overpowering that they distract from the thorny questions about race sex violence and representation his films pose without answering. For better or worse Tarantino aspires to an experience more emotional than intellectual more in line with the giddy transgressive thrill he experienced devouring B-movies as a young cinephile than the more cerebral less immediate charms of the arthouse. He straddles the line separating art and trash but his allegiance clearly lies with trash. In a stoic internal performance that favorably recalls Clint Eastwoods early collaborations with Sergio Leone Jamie Foxx stars as a vengeance-minded slave freed by German bounty hunter Christoph Waltz. The kind-hearted Waltz (its one of the films many inspired sick jokes that a German killer is easily the movies most racially sensitive man) takes the eager Foxx under his wing as a protege and together they travel the South killing bad men and enriching themselves. Then they turn their attention toward freeing Foxxs beloved wife (Kerry Washington in a performance no less compelling for being extremely short on dialogue) from a plantation owned by sadistic Francophile dandy Leonardo DiCaprio. Django Unchained feels throughout like a Southern-fried American companion piece to Inglorious Basterds. Once again Tarantino finds protagonists venturing far beyond enemy lines under false pretenses on a heroic mission using a combination of guile strategy fearlessness and brute force. In this case Waltz and Foxx gain entry to DiCaprio and the corrupt world he lords over by pretending Waltz is a wealthy foreign businessman and Foxx a slaver and consultant helping Waltz evaluate and purchase one of the slaves DiCaprio has trained to fight each other to the death. The smartly cast Foxx and Waltz give antithetical but complementary performances. As in Inglourious Basterds Waltz plays a man who delights in the possibilities and pleasures endemic to the English language; hes a sure shot with a gun but hes even more deadly with words. Where Waltz is gregarious theatrical and external Foxx favors a minimalist approach befitting a character who cannot reveal his true identity or purpose for fear of blowing his cover and dooming his mission. Django Unchained wouldnt be as problematic or powerful without the presence of Samuel L. Jackson as DiCaprios most loyal and twisted slave a canny pragmatist who has so thoroughly internalized his cultures racism and brutality that he seems intent on out-hating even the most vicious slave-driver. Reduced to a broad outline Jacksons character hews uncomfortably close to regressive racial caricatures of the past but Jackson and Tarantino imbue the character with depth smarts and cultural specificity; hes a fully developed human being with his own self-loathing version of a moral code and hes anything but a broad stereotype. Tarantinos sure-footed gorgeously shot darkly funny Western starts strong and gains in momentum until a breathtaking climax that represents the apogee of his adventures in culture-mashing a shoot-out that combines iconic moments from Scarface and The Wild Bunch with a fire-breathing 2Pac rap song thats perfect in spite of or perhaps because of the anachronism. Tarantino comes out with guns blazing on Django Unchained a brawling two-fisted epic equally enamored of blood and words so its fitting that two of its most adrenaline-pumping moments are set to the defiant gangsta rap of Ross and Tupac Shakur whos posthumously paired with James Brown. Their union works spectacularly well in the moment while also cementing the films roots in the blaxploitation films of the early 1970s. Tarantinos smudgy excitable fingerprints are all over every frame of Django Unchained but ironically he breaks the films hypnotic spell by making an ill-advised return to acting in a supporting role that further burdens him with a difficult accent. Tarantino should feel flattered and a little insulted that with Django Unchained he created such a rich vivid convincing world that even a few minutes of chatter by an actor as clumsy as himself is enough to take audiences entirely out of the movie. Tarantino simply isnt a good enough performer for his presence to be anything but a distraction in a rip-roaring crowd-pleaser this consistently great.

Matt Gilmer Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The revenge western ""Django Unchained"" is a hell-for-leather hoot. Quentin Tarantinos colorful patchwork makes an old-fashioned genre fresh and interesting assembling familiar elements in unfamiliar ways and spinning stock characters in surprising (sometimes even deep) directions. He teases us with eccentrically timed action beats giving us a lot of time to get to know the players and like or loathe them before the guns come out. His characters are never flesh-and-blood people but as pop icons they are sublimely entertaining. Set two years before the Civil War the film stars Jamie Foxx as a slave named Django and Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz a German bounty hunter. Schultz greets Djangos slave gang with a tip of the hat and a cheery ""Hello you poor devils."" In short order and with a rich helping of ""Hell yeah"" violence Schultz frees Django and takes him as a partner. Right there with ""Dr. King"" liberating a black man you understand that this is going to be exploitation filmmaking with some thematic bite to it. The film has a lot more on its mind and explores it to stronger effect than its six-shooter trappings imply. Django agrees to help Schultz track down a trio of nefarious outlaws. In exchange Schultz promises to help Django rescue his enslaved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The corpses pile up fast during this setup but the character development is handled with excellent attention to detail. Schultz prefers to outwit his enemies but if reason fails hell blow them out of their boots without batting an eye. Django learns fast how to handle himself as a total outsider in white society. A fascinating contrast to the image of the Eastwood-style loner he proves very much dependent on community and romantic love. Andrew Cooper Associated Press Jamie Foxx as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio as Calvin Candle star in the film ""Django Unchained"" directed by Quentin Tarantino. The Oscar-winning leads are a dream team. Waltz is an urbane delight as the more expressive of the pair gradually ceding the spotlight to Foxx as his newly freed character gains self-assurance. Foxx is willing to be the foil for some humor -- when Schultz invites Django to choose his own wardrobe for the first time the result is an outrageous visual gag -- but he never makes a joke of the character. The laughable fools here are the racists like Don Johnsons Foghorn Leghorn-inspired landowner and the posse of hooded freedom riders who set out to capture Schultz and Django. The extended scene in which they pause to discuss the pros and cons of wearing masks could be an uproarious outtake from ""Blazing Saddles."" Our heroes face a mirror-image pair of adversaries. Leonardo DiCaprio is faux-suave and reptilian as slave owner Calvin Candie an overgrown brat who affects French airs but doesnt speak a word of it. Miraculously transformed by makeup Samuel L. Jackson plays Candies house slave Stephen an utterly evil profane and hilarious villain in his own right. Theyre beautifully detailed characters and as they slowly become aware that Schultz and Django are up to some skulduggery the tension grows nearly unbearable. Tarantino wrings excruciating emotional violence out of the quartets tense dinner-table negotiations for Broomhildas freedom. He doesnt need unholstered guns to get your heart in your throat but when it comes to that the bloodbaths have a perversely hedonistic charge. As always Tarantino shifts fluidly between bombastic comic violence gorgeous swaths of garrulous dialogue and passages of all-out chaos and horror. He turns the ""blow stuff up and joke"" movie into something sublime. Robert Richardsons camera gives the film a sumptuous look yet in every shot you know youre in Tarantinos movie universe. When the director shows up for a late-innings cameo you think hes finally gone too far. Then he sideswipes you with a resolution to the scene that is explosively funny. He knows how to use our movie-conditioned anticipation against us. Watching his movie is like playing chess with a wiseguy friend whos always four moves ahead.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDWatch the iReport interview with Jamie Foxx and the rest of the ""Django"" cast ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWatch the iReport interview with Jamie Foxx and the rest of the ""Django"" cast 0246Story highlights""Django Unchained"" is easily one of the best flicks of 2012 critic Tom Charity saysIts a typical Quentin Tarantino gambit taking two genres and mashing them togetherIn the title role Jamie Foxx teams up with a bounty hounterQuentin Tarantino has made a spaghetti western and cross-pollinated it with a blaxploitation picture but its fully formed unapologetic and easily one of the best popcorn flicks of the year. Ill go further Its my favorite American movie of the past 12 months.Before we get to the why a quick outline of whats in store ""Inglourious Basterds"" standout Christoph Waltz plays a bounty hunter masquerading as a dentist (the wagon he drives has a giant molar wobbling on the roof). Although hes German by birth he speaks such florid English most of the Americans he encounters have trouble keeping up. His name is Schultz but he goes by the more distinguished (and resonant) Dr. King.Dr. King is tracking a gang of outlaw brothers and he enlists the aid of a slave who knows them by sight. This would be Django (Jamie Foxx) who starts the movie as a piece of property but becomes Dr. Kings business partner and ally. Django eventually takes the upper hand as the pair trespasses onto the notorious Candyland the plantation where Djangos wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) serves Southern aristocrat and sadist Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).Notorious B.I.G. helped Jamie Foxx get in Django characterIts a typical even quintessential Tarantino gambit to take two defunct disreputable genres dust them off and mash them together. Its what he does sniff out the nitro and introduce the glycerin. Lately in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and again here hes added historical flashpoints to the mix for a little extra flare -- and upset those commentators who believe that appropriating history (Nazism slavery) for the purposes of entertainment automatically trivializes it.JUST WATCHEDTarantinos Django balancing actReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTarantinos Django balancing act 0444JUST WATCHEDJamie Foxx Django controversy is goodReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJamie Foxx Django controversy is good 0446JUST WATCHEDFilm violence inspires real violence?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFilm violence inspires real violence? 0146JUST WATCHEDJamie Foxx on Django UnchainedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHJamie Foxx on Django Unchained 0233Not true. While Tarantinos morally challenging emotionally wrenching films carve a different path from the sanctimonious costume dramas made to flatter middlebrow tastes -- and perhaps -- seduce awards voters they are no less intellectually provocative for it.The comparison with ""Lincoln"" is irresistible -- the two films take place within five years of each other. One is grounded in assiduous historical research and offers a shrewd analysis of idealism and political pragmatism while the other is pure fantasy. But its the fantasy that truly rattles the chains of slavery confronting not just the racist assumptions but also the economic power structure that underpinned it -- the paradoxes hypocrisies and insidious evils that permitted the system to flourish for so long.Unlike ""Lincoln"" ""Django Unchained"" affords room at the heart of its narrative for compelling and assertive African-American characters both heroic (Foxx in the title role) and otherwise (Samuel L Jackson memorably repellent as a house servant who has become his masters right hand and confidant).Django cast debates How does movie violence influence violence in real life?At a time when so many of our movies aspire to be colorblind (but ""urban"" film remains largely ghettoized) ""Django Unchained"" dares to confront racism as a potent force and a moving target discovering horror and also grotesque comedy in the niceties of Southern etiquette the way a white landowner can maintain a black mistress for instance or tolerate the grumbling of a loyal servant just so long as everyone knows he will have his dogs tear a runaway limb from limb. That may be the films true subject when you get right down to brass tacks the vacuity of good manners and the limits of tolerance.Rambling but in a jaunty generous lets-shoot-the-works fashion ""Django Unchained"" draws on dozens of westerns -- some of them American others from Italy and Germany -- and includes a very funny travesty of the Ku Klux Klan that might have been an outtake from ""Blazing Saddles."" It doffs its hat in the direction of German mythology and the soundtrack samples James Brown 2Pac Rick Ross Ennio Morricone and John Legend in the process. Its a big brazen movie brilliantly acted across the board one of the best things Tarantino has done.Djangos Unchained in new trailerPowered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

"Django Unchained Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Django Unchained is Tarantino undisciplined December 24 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticChristoph Waltz as Schultz and Jamie Foxx as Django in ""Django Unchained.""In ""Django Unchained"" which has its moments of devilish glee in and among dubious wallows in numbing slaughter writer-director-trash compactor Quentin Tarantino delivers a mashup of several hundred of his favorite movies all hanging like barnacles onto a story of a freed slave (Jamie Foxx) and his bounty-hunter savior (Christoph Waltz) out to rescue Djangos wife (Kerry Washington) from a venal plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). The plantations ""house slave"" (Samuel L. Jackson) has no divided loyalties in the eventual standoff.Tarantinos loyalties? They lie wholly with his cinematic inspirations including the Italian-made Westerns (mashups in themselves) made by Sergio Corbucci beginning with ""Django"" (1966) starring Franco Nero. Nero pops up for a cameo here. So does Russ Tamblyn. So does Tarantino looking and acting like a cross between Walter Brennan and Vic Morrow.The movie interpolates the usual quotient of Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western music. (If Tarantino ever remakes ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" hell still find a way to use a theme from ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly."") The filmmaker references among others ""Mandingo"" which came a decade later and which turns up as a riff in ""Django Unchained"" when two of the DiCaprio characters slaves go at it to the death ""Mandingo wrestling"" style.How much you enjoy the most vicious acts of violence will relate directly to your response to the vengeance fantasies in ""Inglourious Basterds"" Tarantinos previous film a popular nutty rewrite of World War II. By the time the filmmakers latest arrives at its astoundingly bloody finale Foxxs Django has become a proto-Shaft a Trouble Man for troubled times. Hes crossed 110th Street and gone all the way to a storybook version of the pre-Civil War-era South where justice and bodies must be served.By the two-hour mark the fun had oozed out of the movie for me. Its long. Or feels it. Tarantinos scripts tend to read and play like writing samples stitched together full of heavily brocaded monologues for his most voluble characters. Yet hes a lousy self-editor and despite his prodigious filmmaking knowledge and lust for filmmaking history as a director he struggles with pacing and excess and detours. Slow buildup; sudden blasting brutality; a few jokes (Jonah Hill turns up in an ur-Ku Klux Klan sight gag). And then some dead air. His best work so far -- ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Death Proof"" and more subtly ""Jackie Brown"" -- speaks for itself on its own terms. Im more conflicted about the mixture of jocularity and sadism in ""Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained.""Theres a moment offering a glimpse of something stronger. Its a flashback to a scene in which a man is torn apart by rabid dogs delivered visually as troubling shards of a painful memory. This is not a moment existing for kicks. Its better more complicated than that. I wish more of ""Django Unchained"" came from the adult Tarantino rather than the eternal talented but blinkered adolescent. He may well know his audience.

Connoisseurs of ""wet"" gore will be especially delighted given that every bullet generates a whoopee-cushions worth of red sauce. The only violence thats not a kick is done unto slaves who are whipped torn to pieces by dogs and in a particularly ugly moment driven to slaughter one another for sport. But the helpless rage we feel in those scenes is in the service of Tarantinos larger goal to make the vengeance on the films racists all the more gleeful. Carnage rarely comes so morally uncomplicated. Django Unchained doesnt merely hit its marks; it blows them to bloody chunks. Its manna for mayhem mavens. The cast is hip but you knew that already -- hipsterism is automatically conferred on actors in QT pictures. And though the plot turns are predictable every scene is apt to wander off into an alley of irrelevance in which comic surprises await -- among them a protracted griping session featuring Klansmen who cant see out their eyeholes. Parts of the film are maniacally funny. Of course no matter how hard you laugh at Tarantinos audacity you have a feeling hes laughing louder. For all its pleasures Django Unchained feels too easy too dead-center in Tarantinos comfort zone. Hes not challenging himself in any way that matters. He has become his own Yes Man.As the title gunslinger a slave liberated (with a couple of gun blasts) from his vicious masters by the puckishly homicidal German dentist turned bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) Jamie Foxx grits his teeth and stares daggers but hes not exactly the life of the party. Maybe thats because Djangos mind is on his beautiful wife (Kerry Washington). Schultzs quarry is a pair of wanted men who happen to be the very same scumsucking dirtbags who tore the loving slave couple asunder branding them first. The black man and the German fast friends wind their way through sundry towns full of wide-eyed racists (nobodys seen a n----- on a horse before); a plantation overseen by Don Johnson in Colonel Sanders threads stroking his mustache; and finally ""Candyland"" an even vaster plantation on which rich-boy aristocrat Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) buys sells and trains n-----s for grisly to-the-death ""Mandingo fighting."" Candie is also an amateur phrenologist which means he can hold forth eloquently on the inferior brainpan of the n----- race. And hes not even the most hateful most dangerous dude in Candyland. That would be Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) the self-described ""house n-----"" who is righteously angered by a n----- like Django who doesnt know his place alongside all the other n-----s.Youll notice in the above a goodly number of ellipses because I cant write the word that the white characters (plus Stephen) in Django Unchained throw around most liberally. Tarantino took some flak for its occasional use in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but here he really opens the sluice gates. Its a smart move How else can he shock and infuriate us? The movie pays homage to the spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties and seventies a degenerate genre (Sergio Leones magisterial epics excepted) best savored for its subversiveness -- for implicitly mocking mainstream American Westerns with their faith in the judiciousness of the justice system and assurances that the unholy excesses of capitalism (in the form of greedy land barons etc.) were never systemwide. But most of us are well beyond buying into that brand of flimflam. We live in a cynical plug-ugly grindhouse world that is at least onscreen of QTs making. Absent anything much to subvert the movie is all potshots and N-words.Well there is one novel touch Jacksons Stephen. Has there ever been an African-American character so mindfully destructive of his own people? The tone he takes with DiCaprios Candie -- a mixture of fatherly sternness and obsequiousness -- is creepy enough. But its how he conspires with his master pushing him to be even less merciful with Stephens fellow slaves thats demonic. Since Tarantino is loath to psychologize (and since Jacksons acting is as usual monotonic) we dont know the whys of Stephens identification with his oppressor. We only know hes lethal -- and that he needs a lot of killing.DiCaprio is very amusing as the petit-king Candie to the palace born majestically self-centered but sufficiently steeped in Southern codes of hospitality to preside over a long formal dinner for guests (Django and Schultz) who are purportedly there to buy a battered Mandingo fighter. (Theyve actually come for Djangos wife.) Laura Cayouette had me laughing out loud as Candies sister who says almost nothing but is graciousness incarnate offering animated antebellum smiles to nearly every male utterance. Plenty of well-known character actors make villainous noises and die colorfully. But its Christoph who waltzes away with the movie. He has elegance class. Hes ebullient as he blows his foes to kingdom come -- his eyes sparkle.In the grandest action set piece the joke is that theres no end of blood you can squeeze from a stone-dead body. Django Unchained should end there but lurches on for nearly half an hour. Tarantino likes his action movies multi-orgasmic. If only he had more visual resources. There are a few seventies-style zooms and whooshes and some tacky slo-mo but weve come to expect the landscape in Westerns (particularly Italian-style) to be a character sublime or sinister and here the look is TV-flat the rhythms flabby. Perhaps that shouldnt be surprising. In Tarantinos last few movies the settings are largely functional stages on which he can enact his rituals of injury and retribution. If he stays on this track hes going to bore all but the gorehounds to pieces --its going to be Bland Guignol.

(WEINSTEIN) Heres a secret about the great film directors The only people they really make films for are themselves. Hacks make movies solely for audiences (or for Oscars). But real artists - high or low - simply tell the stories they want to hear. Which is what makes Quentin Tarantino both an artist and a complicated case. Because while he clearly makes the films he wants to see what he really wants to see are big campy over-the-top exploitation pictures. He could do more ""artistic"" work. Many critics would like him to. But the irony is then he wouldnt be an artist. Hed be a hack. ""Django Unchained"" - the title refers not to a great guitarist but a famously violent spaghetti Western with Franco Nero - is like most of Tarantinos films basically a B movie with an A budget. A mash-up of cowboy tropes and blaxploitation violence it stars Christoph Waltz as a bounty hunter and Jamie Foxx as the runaway slave who teams up with him. An impatient man Waltz seems to have given up on the ""or alive"" part of the Wanted posters he carries; basically he finds bad guys kills them and cashes in. But Foxx has his own prize in mind - finding the wife who was torn away from him and sold to a brutal Mississippi plantation owner. If youre looking for a layered examination of a decadent culture or even complicated characters - please look somewhere else. Tarantinos flirtation with that sort of filmmaking reached its apex in ""Jackie Brown"" - and for him temporarily at least also hit a dead end. Since then - with ""Kill Bill"" with ""Grindhouse"" with ""Inglourious Basterds"" - hes taken a different path. That doesnt mean his recent films arent fun. Tarantino the greatest video-store clerk who ever lived isnt just a wealth of detail but a motor-mouthed writer of dialogue and a snazzy stylist. His films bristle with energy with quotable lines with literally explosive action. ""Django"" has all that as well as an interesting combination of two dissimilar genres. On one hand its has the look of a Euro Western from the post-Eastwood era - not the sweeping Sergio Leone epics that kicked the craze off but the brutal revenge fantasies that followed in their wake all sweat and sadism and bad teeth. On the other it has the themes of some of the black action movies of the `70s - both urban features like ""Shaft"" (which gets a sly namecheck here) as well as the more bizarre ones like ""Mandingo"" set in the foul fever-swamp of the plantation. So the witty Waltz is really acting the part of those itinerant ""international"" stars who showed up in those old cowboy flicks. And fly Foxx in his shades and tight suits is rocking the radical appeal of a take-no-prisoners Fred Williamson or Jim Brown. People are bound to read racist overtones into the material but Tarantino has the consciousness of a 12-year-old boy; theres nothing more to his message here than Slavery Is Bad. (Yes Samuel L. Jackson plays a shuffling servant and a dead ringer for Uncle Ben - but as one scene shows its an act part of his own collaborating camouflage.) Instead Tarantinos far more obsessed with new twists on old favorites. So the film resurrects underused character actors from Bruce Dern to Robert Carradine. Or cues up dusty AM hits not all of which fit the material (Jim Croces ""I Got a Name""? Really Quentin?) Of course theres more to any Tarantino movie than simply rehashed cues reworked cliches and ridiculous action. A scene of Klansmen squabbling about the eyeholes in their hoods (""I cant see a damn thing"") is wickedly funny if overlong. And all the actors are fine with Leonardo DiCaprio having a high old time as a loathsome villain with a crackpot interest in phrenology. Still does all of that add up to a serious genre film - in the way that ""The Departed"" was a serious crime movie or ""Unforgiven"" was a serious Western? No. But clearly Tarantino isnt interested in being ""serious"" at least not now. Like all great filmmakers hes interested in making the films he wants to see. And has wanted to ever since he was an 11-year-old at the drive-in staring up wide-eyed at the screen from his mommas car. Ratings note The film contains graphic gore extreme violence strong language and sexual situations. Django Unchained (R) Weinstein (165 min.) Directed by Quentin Tarantino.

"Movie review Django Unchained is Tarantino unleashed - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review Django Unchained is Tarantino unleashedThe filmmakers audacious talents are given full rein in a wildly entertaining pre-Civil War epic whose comic flourishes only add to the gritty slavery dramas blistering power.December 23 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington star in ""Django Unchained."" (The Weinstein Company )Here is the particular brilliance of Quentin Tarantino He can rip a horrific page out of history a for his latest ""Django Unchained"" slavery in the antebellum South a put it through his favorite grindhouse mill kick in biting comedy whose sheer audacity and searing irony demands laughter and yet ... and yet ... never for a moment diminish or let us forget the brutal reality.What the writer-director did so caustically to Nazis in 2009s ""Inglourious Basterds"" a scalping (literally) and roasting (comically) a was apparently just a warm-up.In ""Django"" Tarantino is a man unchained creating his most articulate intriguing provoking appalling hilarious exhilarating scathing and downright entertaining film yet. Even given the grand tradition of artists using their work for sharp social rebukes a Mel Brooks genius swipe at Nazism in ""The Producers"" for one aTarantinos mash-ups between the unconscionable inhumanity of others and his outrageous riffs on the matter defy comparison.PHOTOS Django Unchained - Quentin Tarantino Jamie Foxx Christoph WaltzThe four horseman of his apocalypse a Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson a come with guns and metaphors blazing. Their archetypes serve to mark out the battleground Tarantino bloodies with a vengeance that surpasses everything else in his archive including ""Kill Bill"" volumes 1 and 2.Django (Foxx) the slave/freeman; Dr. King Schultz (Waltz) the liberator; Calvin Candie (DiCaprio) the abusive plantation owner; and Stephen (Jackson) the sycophant house slave provide the films chaos and catharsis with every rise and fall of their clashes. The indictment comes with each stroke of the lash a and there are countless of them a none harder to watch than the whipping of Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) Djangos wife.With Tarantino theres always a very specific artistic influence informing the theatrics on screen and in ""Django"" the style is a priceless cut at spaghetti westerns. The primary homage is to the two Sergios (Corbucci who introduced ""Django"" into the movie lexicon in 1966 and Leone who created a fistful of classics). Whether it was nothing more than a creative choice or a latent desire to extend the Italian dominance of the genre across generations and borders Tarantino has never seemed more comfortable in the saddle.The film begins with a line of slaves shackled together on a forced march across a desert that is scorching hot by day frigid by night. Title cards which are dropped in periodically their size a clue to significance starts the timeline at two years before the Civil War. The arrival of Dr. Schultz ostensibly a dentist a giant tooth bobbing atop his coach changes the course of everyones life. He is actually a bounty hunter looking to acquire a slave named Django to identify the three murdering-thieving Brittle brothers who mask their illegal activity as overseers for hire and have a substantial price on their heads.Best of 2012A Video GamesA |A MoviesA |A TVA |A MusicA |A JazzSchultz puts forth his proposition with such elegant erudition that it rarely fails to nettle nearly anyone he encounters. This first group a matted bunch of slavers who spit tobacco and growl at Schultz to ""talk English"" are typical. The cultural clash becomes one of the films smartest running gags and Waltzs delivery as slick as it is sly is possibly better than his Nazi colonel in Tarantinos ""Basterds"" which won him an Oscar.DiCaprios villain who turns up later is equally exceptional in radically different ways. It is one of the films conundrums for Foxx technically the leading man. He does a fine job of melding his newly freed slave into a masterful gunslinger with all the swagger and retribution that suggests. But there are so many finely crafted performances around him its hard for him to rise above the rest.The side proposition Schultz makes with Django is his freedom once he identifies the Brittles. Over the many campfires that follow life stories are traded a friendship is formed and a partnership in the bounty-hunting game is hammered out ""I get paid to shoot white men?""As satisfying as that is a for us as well a what Django wants most is to buy the freedom of his beloved Broomhilda their marriage illegal in those times.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESDjango Unchained a brazen bloody spectacle critics sayDecember 26 2012Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino on his funniest scene...December 26 2012Oscar 8-Ball Quentin Tarantinos Django UnchainedDecember 17 2012Django unchained looks at U.S. pastDecember 15 2012Golden Globes 2013 Latecomer Django makes strong showingDecember 13 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentQuentin TarantinoCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-django-unchained-review20121224,0,2901748.story",200,djangounchained24,djangounchained,latimes

Django Unchained (    1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Christmas Day nationwide) is classic Tarantino. This inventive beautifully shot reimagining of history features Jamie Foxx as Django a slave-turned-hero who teams up with offbeat dentist/bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. (Christoph Waltz). The dialogue particularly in the first hour is some of the wittiest of any screenplay in recent memory.STORY DiCaprio is choosy about his films filmmakersAs the movie opens Foxx is one of a group of chained slaves being transported by traders on a cold night two years before the Civil War. The German-born Schultz buys Django and offers him his freedom in exchange for his assistance in tracking down a trio of murderous brothers.Django leads Schultz to his quarry -- and finds he has an affinity for that line of work. Schultz suggests they become partners. After a bloody stopover in a frontier town the two arrive at the plantation of Big Daddy (played winningly by Don Johnson) who resembles a younger Colonel Sanders.Django proves an astute bounty hunter with a sharp aim. But above all Django wants to reunite with his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The pairs search leads them to a nasty Francophile named Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and ultimately to his massive plantation known as Candyland where Broomhilda is being held. Candies most trusted house slave Stephen (an almost unrecognizable Samuel L. Jackson) becomes suspicious of Django and Schultz which spurs the films most absurdly vivid and grisly scene.Foxx does a terrific job as the taciturn Django and Washington is wonderful as Broomhilda but the performances of Jackson Waltz and DiCaprio are the most memorable. The entire ensemble is first-rate and the musical score filled with classic spaghetti Western compositions as well as a song by John Legend makes the movie all the more indelible.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Actors Jamie Foxx and Kerry Washington discuss their new Spaghetti Western ""Django Unchained.""

"Django Unchained | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; django-unchained ) Django Unchained (United States 2012) December 23 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the great strengths of Quentin Tarantinos films is the way his love of cinema permeates every frame. From subtle throw-away lines and in-jokes to more obvious nods (such as the ""old fashioned"" Columbia logo at the beginning or the 70s-style opening credits) it wends its way through his productions. Over the course of his career Tarantino has paid homage to a number of genres; with Django Unchained its time for the Western. Of course the director never does anything in a straightforward manner so this is also a revenge flick and a somewhat offbeat comedy. Tarantino may be the best working director to take scenes of blood mayhem and gore and transform them into moments of hilarity. Pulp Fiction introduced this tendency (""Oh man I shot Marvin in the face"") and Tarantino has honed it since. Despite the occasional brutality of the material Django Unchained includes some of the best laugh aloud scenes of any 2012 motion picture regardless of the genre. Over the years we have come to expect things from Tarantino and he delivers most of them in Django Unchained. There are the high-octane action scenes which tend to be short and brutal. Theres copious gore; when someone gets shot you can be damn sure hes going to bleed. Theres a tendency for the director to thumb his nose at political correctness. Were bound to see female bare feet at some point. And theres a sense of energy and momentum that culminates in satisfying violence. Perhaps the only thing somewhat on the back burner in Django Unchained is Tarantinos penchant for witty repartee and clever monologues. Theres a little of it here but not nearly as much as in some of his previous endeavors. Still this is very much ""a Quentin Tarantino Film"" in every sense of the phrase and those who build expectations based on those four words wont be disappointed. The movie opens in 1858 Texas with the unorthodox purchase of a slave Django (Jamie Foxx) by a dentist-turned-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Since Schultz doesnt believe in slavery he soon frees Django and the two become partners in Schultzs business. After a profitable winter they head to Mississippi where their goal is to locate Djangos wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). When they succeed they find an excuse to be invited to the plantation where she is being held. There they are guests of the mansions master Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) where their act bamboozles everyone except Candies personal slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who smells a rat the moment he sets eyes on Django. As has been true of past efforts Tarantino coaxes memorable performances out of his actors. Joining the ranks of John Travolta Uma Thurman and Christoph Waltz (among others) is Jamie Foxx. After Ray Foxx was viewed seriously as a dramatic actor but he hasnt been given much of note to do in recent years. With Django Unchained Tarantino provides him a meaty role and he tears into it with relish. He also displays a warm and unique chemistry with co-star Waltz who is once again great. Leonardo DiCaprio in a rare supporting role shows that despite his heartthrob reputation hes capable of playing a truly loathsome villain. Samuel L. Jackson buried under prosthetics and makeup is recognizable primarily because of his voice and attitude. Tarantinos ""reclamation project"" (in which he takes a once-popular actor and gives him something interesting to do) is Don Johnson although his screen time is limited. There are a few notable cameos Jonah Hill Amber Tamblyn Bruce Dern Tom Savini Robert Carradine and Franco Nero (who played the lead character in the unrelated 1966 film Django). One of the best things about Tarantino films in general and Django Unchained in particular is that the viewer is never sure where the narrative is going. Tarantino delights in unexpected surprises some of which are sudden and violent. Consider for example John Travoltas death mid-way through Pulp Fiction - Id wager no one saw that coming. While theres nothing quite that dramatic in Django Unchained the movie has its moments and the storyline doesnt follow an unbending trajectory. Although its technically a Western Tarantino doesnt feel constrained by limits often placed on the genre. He stirs in elements of exploitation/blacksploitation to give Django Unchained a more pulpy high energy feel. This is a serious movie with some serious things to say about how blacks were treated in the Old South but theres plenty of action to go along with the darker material. Not unexpectedly Tarantino inserts himself into Django Unchained in a part thats larger than a cameo and smaller than a supporting role. Its tough to say whether his acting has improved but he tries on an Australian accent that is ridiculously bad. However the director may be self-aware enough to recognize his limitations in front of the camera and his appearance distracting as it is could be designed to be cheesy. Or not. Difficult to say. Django Unchained may be Tarantinos most uplifting movie to date. Without revealing the ending I can say its less nihilistic than that of say Reservoir Dogs. Age may not have mellowed Tarantino but at least he can see the value in a little optimism. Django Unchained isnt in the absolute top tier of the directors films; I consider Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds to be more complete experiences. But this is a fine accomplished effort and a great way to spend nearly three hours in a movie theater. Most people will leave with a smile and those who dont probably should have gone to see something softer in the first place.

More about Django Unchained >> For all I know Tarantino works on a typewriter or longhand on a legal pad (or dictates his copy to a Gal Friday in spike heels) but in any event as the banter ping-ponged across the dining table in the plantation mansion of slave-master Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio twirling his mustache) with Jamie Foxx (in the title role) Christoph Waltz (as a winking bounty hunter) Kerry Washington (the slave girl Django has come to rescue) and Samuel L. Jackson (Candies slave majordomo) all taking their turns the endless over-the-top badinage really started to bug me. Tarantino has done this before (Sydney Tamiia Poitier and her gal pals gabbing away in Death Proof the lengthy bar scene in Inglourious Basterds) and it really doesnt make for great cinema despite what Tarantino may think. Less is more dude. But then again if youre going to pay homage to Mandingo and pre-Eastwood spaghetti westerns and blaxploitation pics and Sam Peckinpah and maybe a little John Ford too economy is not going to be the driving concern. Django Unchained tells the tale of a stoic slave his back crosshatched with whip scars who is offered his freedom if he helps a German-born bounty hunter track down an infamous band of brothers with whom Django has had firsthand experience. ""I kill white people and get paid for it?"" Django says listening to this proposition. ""Whats not to like?"" Foxx is the straight man in all this bringing dignity and dash to the proceedings while Waltz who nabbed a supporting-actor Oscar for his portrayal of a zealous SS officer in Inglourious Basterds gets to steal another show with his gentlemanly elocution and dangerous panache. Like Inglourious Basterds too Django Unchained is big on the N-word. Not Nazi but the other one which befitting a narrative set in the pre-Civil War South is uttered often with contempt. Tonally like Inglourious Basterds again Django Unchained is all over the place. Its a fight to convey genuine emotion or genuine anything when every scene smacks of archness tipping its Stetson to other movies other eras. Tarantino lines up a parade of his B-movie icons to show their faces Don Johnson Bruce Dern Michael Parks Franco Nero Russ Tamblyn Lee Horsley Robert Carradine and its impossible not to get into some of the cameos some of the stunts. And when Foxxs Django shows up dressed like Gainsboroughs Blue Boy in the guise of a ""black slaver"" advising Waltzs Dr. Schultz on his purchases its fine and dandy stuff. Ditto some of the jokes (DiCaprios Candie is an avowed Francophile but he doesnt speak French; Waltzs bounty hunter is also a dentist and his wagon is topped with a giant molar). Is Django Unchained about race and power and the ugly side of history? Only as much as Inglourious Basterds was about race and power and the ugly side of history. Its a live-action heads-exploding shoot-em-up cartoon. Sometimes it crackles and sometimes it merely cracks. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

BOTTOM LINE Quentin Tarantinos wild wild Western goes all-out but keeps going for nearly three long hours. Initially terrific ultimately tiresome. CAST Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio Kerry Washington LENGTH 245 Less has never been more for Quentin Tarantino but a little less of ""Django Unchained"" his over-the-top overlong splatter Western would have been plenty. Its vintage Tarantino full of outrageous violence creative casting (Don Johnson as a Klansman) and rollicking rock music. There are some serious moments too but ""Django Unchained"" almost marks this directors first real comedy. Unfortunately it wears out its welcome about two-thirds through which means -- no kidding -- 45 more minutes to go. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Late nights convention takes Who did it best? LIer preps for next Americas Got Talent Like ""Inglourious Basterds"" Tarantinos latest borrows its name and attitude from an old Italian flick in this case the 1966 Spaghetti Western ""Django."" (Its blue-eyed star Franco Nero gets a cameo.) Our Django played by a mostly stone-faced Jamie Foxx is a slave searching the Deep South for his auctioned wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Tarantino uses this milieu to dole out on-screen whippings and maulings -- hes an exploitation filmmaker after all and a great one -- but he also focuses on the rage and shame of the slaves who are forced to watch. The man who unchains Django is Dr. King (get it?) Schultz played by ""Basterds"" Oscar winner Christoph Waltz once again outshining his A-list castmates. Friendly and well-mannered even when shooting people in the head Schultz is a bounty hunter who purchases Django as a helpmate. But the two men get on so well that Schultz makes Django a free man then a full business partner. ""Like slavery"" he explains cheerfully ""its a flesh-for-cash business."" Then Tarantino really piles it on. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Calvin Candie owner of a plantation called Candyland; Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious as his belligerent house slave; and the plot somehow expands to include blood-sport wrestling and Australian dynamiters. By that time though youll be checking your watch and wondering how such an entertaining film became so boring. 235 VideoTrailer Django Unchained PLOT In 1858 a former slave turned bounty hunter searches for his auctioned wife. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (extreme violence language sexual themes) CAST Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio Kerry Washington LENGTH 245 BOTTOM LINE Quentin Tarantinos wild wild Western goes all-out but keeps going for nearly three long hours.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 721am on Friday Dec. 28 2012 Friday Dec. 28 2012 Friday Dec. 28 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Django Unchained director/writer Quentin Tarantinos wantonly violent slave-era revenge fantasy has about as much to do with the holiday spirit as a grinch with a grudge.But opening the film on Christmas Day plays right into Tarantinos sense of pop-culture irony and mainstream subversion. That hes also juggling such issues as race and retribution with all the finesse and wisdom of a child tossing hand grenades only makes the whole thing even more combustible and controversial.Too bad there isnt a better movie to go along with all the flame-throwing bravado.A mashup of the 1966 Italian spaghetti Western Django and early 70s blaxploitation Westerns Django Unchained offers Tarantino yet another chance to show off his Pulp Fiction-style twist on history. While it worked with his smart-aleck revisionist take on WWII in Inglourious Basterds it just comes across as contrived and excessive here.We meet Django (Jamie Foxx) as he is being transported with other slaves. He is rescued by a somewhat abolitionist-minded German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who schools him in the ways of tracking down and killing men. Django becomes the Robin to his Batman but he wants one thing in return to go back to the Mississippi plantation where his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) is still enslaved to free her.Of course thats what they set out to do and thats where they cross paths with owner Calvin Candie played charmingly by Leonardo DiCaprio. In fact the movies best scene -- echoing the suspense of the opening moments of Basterds -- hinges on whether Candie will fall for the ruse that Schultz and Django have come up with to try and free Broomhilda from his cruel clutches.But that kind of tension is lacking in the rest of the film which squanders not only Tarantinos considerable talents but those of Washington (who doesnt have much to do but look frightened); the underrated Walton Goggins (Justified The Shield) as a thick-headed cowboy; and especially Samuel L. Jackson as Stephen a smart-mouthed obedient house slave who tangles with Django getting some of the best lines in the process.Its possible to argue that the shuffling character is a commentary on Hollywoods history of black minstrelsy and is a counterpoint to Djangos growing independence but with Tarantino pulling the strings it just comes across as cartoonish a vehicle for cheap laughs.Djangos dialogue is perfunctory with little of the savvy back-and-forth of other Tarantino movies (namely Pulp Fiction) and the n-word is thrown around like a ball at a dog park. It just seems to be there to raise hackles. (Or to pick another fight with Spike Lee who savaged him for using the word constantly in the superior 1997 film Jackie Brown). While the violence is plentiful its neither stylistically impressive (as in the ""Kill Bill"" movies) nor gripping (Reservoir Dogs). Its just numbing.Granted Tarantino as part of his grindhouse/drive-in-movie aesthetic is riffing off the language and the violence of those late-60s/early-70s films. But what Tarantino seems to forget is that the original Django clocked in at a crisp 87 minutes. At a whopping two hours and 45 minutes Django Unchained belabors its points to blood-drenched exhaustion.On the plus side Waltz is solid as always and Foxx brings a sense of energy to his role. And its cool that Tarantino has the freedom to make a movie about anything he wants. How many other movies about slavery are at the multiplex these days?But its not enough to save Django Unchained a film forever imprisoned by Tarantinos more glorious past.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Comments (19) click to enlarge Django Unchained Free Rated R  165 minutes  2012 Quentin Tarantino follows his head-turning World War II adventure Inglourious Basterds with another exercise in pop-culture provocation turning the old western hero Django into a freed slave who sets out to rescue his wife from bondage in the antebellum south. Like the earlier movie in which Jewish-American soldiers assassinate Hitler this one draws heavily on minority group revenge fantasy the only difference being that the trick isnt as impressive the second time around. Nor are there as many good oddball characters the action being largely relegated to Jamie Foxx as Django Christoph Waltz as the German bounty hunter who frees him and Leonardo DiCaprio as the nefarious plantation owner who holds the woman.

"Django Unchained review Quentin sets himself free | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDjango Unchained review Quentin sets himself freeQuentin Tarantinos Django Unchained seems like bloody homage to the spaghetti western. But theres some real love and thoughtfulness happening here.Stars of Django Unchained including Christoph Waltz and Jamie Foxx seem to be having a grand old time sharing the directors ghastly vision.  (Alliance Films)  Leonardo DiCaprio plays a childlike plantation owner in Django Unchained.  (ANDREW COOPER / ALLIANCE FILMS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 21 2012 Django Unchained (out of 4) Starring Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz Leonardo DiCaprio Samuel L. Jackson Kerry Washington and Don Johnson. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. 164 minutes. Opens Dec. 25 at major theatres. 18A Listen carefully to Quentin Tarantinos Django Unchained and you might hear the sound of not one but two sets of lovebirds cooing. This may be difficult to discern amidst all the bullets blood rough language and racist inhumanity (including torture). But the romances are there and theyre keys to understating the thinking behind a film that might otherwise be dismissed as another work of violent style by a man who is no stranger to overkill. The first love story is the films main narrative driver. Jamie Foxx is the title Django a suddenly freed slave in pre-Civil War southern America (historians call it the Antebellum South) who aims to get back his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) -- and also to get some payback. Broomhilda has been taken from Django and forced into sexual bondage by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) the childlike owner of a vast Mississippi plantation called Candyland. Enslaved blacks do Candies bidding and also that of his devoted house slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson). Djangos rescue/vengeance quest teams him with German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) who shoots people mainly for money but also does pro bono civil rights advocacy out of some quaint European notion of conscience. Now for the second love story which is the reason for the first. Django Unchained is Tarantinos valentine to the spaghetti western genre specifically the blood-splattered grindhouse movies of his 1960s-to-1970s youth made by Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci. He goes so far as to take his title from Corbuccis 1966 movie Django and to use that films star Franco Nero for an amusing barroom cameo in Django Unchained. Besides paying homage to two Sergios Tarantino also tips his Stetson to three bloody Sams -- Fuller Raimi and Peckinpah -- who also share his filmmaking sensibility that all blood should come by the bucketful. To that end he employs Peckinpahs infamous exploding ""squibs"" (condoms filled with blood and meat) to maximize the visual splatter. Tarantino also salutes a Monty as in Python in such scenes of lunacy as when Django and Schultz encounter a gang of Ku Klux Klan vigilantes who not only cant shoot straight they cant see straight. Their hood eyeholes were badly sewn by a KKK members wife you see -- or rather you dont see. Jonah Hill makes a stunt cameo appearance for this scene but Eric Idle and John Cleese might have been better picks. Tarantino is clearly having a grand ol time with Django Unchained and so are his actors every one of whom are more than willing to share in the writer/directors filmic vision no matter how ghastly it may be. The picture is also a grand long time. It indulgently runs to just 15 minutes shy of three hours and since it lacks the looping structure of Tarantinos masterwork Pulp Fiction you feel the flab. Its a full hour before Django and Schultz even reach Candyland and meet Calvin Candie. Prior to that theyre busy turning the Deep South into the Wild West which includes a visit to a Tennessee plantation run by a slave trader named Big Daddy (Don Johnson). This interlude seems more like an excuse to revive the career of Johnson whom Tarantino was a fan of long before Johnsons 80s stardom in TVs Miami Vice. Tarantino long ago decided he was just going to do what he wants to do in his films and that includes using 21st-century profanity in a 19th-century setting (though he swears hes historically accurate) and employing an eclectic (and effective) soundtrack that ranges from Jim Croce to Richie Havens to James Brown and 2Pac. Yet Django Unchained is most certainly not a send-up of spaghetti westerns. Tarantino is making the type of film he has long adored and working with actors familiar and new whom he wants to work with. Nor is it just violence for the sake of violence something everyone is sadly attuned to in the wake of recent tragedy in gun-obsessed America. Tarantino is unstinting in his depiction of how slavery and racism worked on a daily basis in the Antebellum South. This included using men for blood sport (torn apart by dogs and in brutal ""Mandingo"" wrestling) and using women for vile sexual gratification. These things are part of Django Unchained in between the chuckles and carnage because thats how things were in 19th-century America Tarantino asserts. He wants us to think about this to really think. You cant say that about every Quentin Tarantino movie.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 21 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 21 2012 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Quentin Tarantino Written by Quentin Tarantino Starring Jamie Foxx Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio Classification 18A Country USA Language English In Quentin Tarantinos world theres no rest for the outrageous.His new film Django Unchained is the follow-up to his Second World War drama Inglourious Basterds which saw a squad of brave Jews assassinate Hitler and bring the war to a close. With Django Unchained the counter-factual history is a little less dramatic but the provocation is just as extreme This antebellum action comedy sees Jamie Foxx as a slave transformed into a righteous cowboy vigilante in an unnervingly irreverent take on the horrors of slavery. Watch Django Unchained official trailer Given that Hollywoods treatment of slavery has ranged from the repulsive (The Birth of a Nation) to patronizing (Gone with the Wind) there is an overdue aspect of historical restitution going on here. Its also a strike against attempts at contemporary revisionism that have seen legislators in Texas and Tennessee (two states where the film takes place) alter textbooks to reduce or drop references to slavery.Yet Tarantinos approach is so enamoured of the exploitation cinema he emulates there is a serious risk that noble intentions get smothered in juvenile comedy and cinematic grandstanding. The record number of uses of the N-word (109 according to Variety) and the instances of men and women stripped whipped forced to fight to the death torn apart by dogs or threatened with castration are racial sadism as entertainment both for the white people in the movie and by implication every movie-ticket buyer.For the devoted fan cult Tarantinos signature style - perfectly calibrated action set pieces and flavourful stream-of-consciousness dialogue - are all here. The same goes for a predictable revenge plot After Django is freed from bondage he enters a training period with bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) in scenes evocative of Uma Thurmans Bride in Kill Bill before confronting the evildoers. As well there are the usual cinephile shout-outs in this hybrid of blaxploitation and sixties spaghetti western Django Unchained comes with so many allusions to other works it should probably come with onscreen footnotes.One such reference point is the cinema of Sergio Corbucci whose 1966 spaghetti western Django starring Franco Nero is a template here (Nero gets a cameo). There is also a touch of German mythology Waltz a bounty hunter pretending to be a dentist with an absurd giant tooth on a spring atop his wagon is as unctuously charming and verbose as he was in Inglourious Basterds but here he is a voice for enlightened European reasoning opposed to American barbarism. Very much Djangos educator he compares Djangos quest to rescue his wife Hily (Brunhilda von Shaft) to Siegfrieds mythical quest. Less-high-flown references evoke Mel Brookss Blazing Saddles and Richard Fleischers Mandingo with former heavyweight boxing champ Ken Norton as the sex slave.Provocative bad taste and high style are Tarantinos signature but what is truly shocking is how often he lets the film lapses into tediousness. He continues to be a terrific scene writer but the connective tissue is less convincing and at two hours and 45 minutes the film feels ponderous and the sporadic bratty humour is not enough to leaven the mix. Clumsy flashback sequences are obviously intended as genre parody but they strain patience.Thanks to the introduction of new colourful characters things pick up in the second half when Django and Dr. King (get it?) have amassed enough money from bounty-hunting to try to buy Brunhilda (Kerry Washington) out of slavery by posing as dealers interested in buying some male fighting slaves. They head off to the epicentre of evil a plantation named Candyland where Brunhilda is held captive by plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).DiCaprio is in fine form revelling in a performance that suggests Late Brando Baroque as a yellow-toothed epicene connoisseur of fighting slaves who spins his absurd racial theories over fancy dinners. The Candyland episode also provides us with a chilly turn from Samuel L. Jackson as an octogenarian house Negro Stephen a shrewd protector of the status quo.The weakest link in Django Unchained is unfortunately Django. Foxxs transformation from an unkempt and unclad slave to a servant in a puffy Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit to a tough dude gunslinger is almost all visual. While silence for the traditional western hero is a source of power too often Foxxs character seems merely a cipher for Tarantinos ideas of tough-guy cool and remains one-dimensional despite the costume changes.Even the explosive final half-hour featuring the cartoonish flying bodies and splatterrific payback that are the directors brand fails to provide the catharsis promised by the title.

""Django Unchained"" might have been a revelation in 2005. But after Quentin Tarantino and others have spent years spoofing 60s and 70s genre movies this mock spaghetti Western tastes like it came out of the microwave. Like all Tarantino movies ""Django"" features expertly engineered surprises plenty of big movie moments and several instances of loopy brilliance but its also a rehash of ""Inglourious Basterds"" with slavery substituting for Nazism. Moreover this year alone ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" the Will Ferrell comedy ""Casa de Mi Padre"" and the cartoon ""ParaNorman"" all spoofed 70s grindhouse flicks. This line of humor is starting to take on the air of mother-in-law jokes. (""Django"" which had a completely different plot was a 1966 Western made by Italians starring Franco Nero who has a cameo here.) Jamie Foxx and Christoph Waltz make a superb pair of mismatched buddies though. Foxxs Django is a slave who is rescued by Waltzs Dr. King Schultz a mysterious German who liberates the other man from a chain gang in Texas. When Django turns out to be a natural marksman the pair go into business together as bounty hunters. ""Kill white people and get paid for it? Whats not to like?"" says Django. Their goal is to exterminate three evil overseer brothers whom Schultz needs Django to identify then find Djangos wife (Kerry Washington) who has been brutalized and sold off to a plantation in Tennessee owned by a twinkly eyed monster (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose hobbies include watching ""mandingo fighting"" -- gladiatorial combat to the death between black men. Tarantino has earned the privilege of taking his time to reveal his secrets and the care with which the writer-director allows Schultz to emerge as a chatty amusing cynic who despises slavery is a pleasure as is the way Django gradually grows from a haunted nearly silent victim to a slightly maladapted sidekick to a confident hero. One of the funniest moments comes when Django invited to pick out his own costume while posing as Schultzs valet takes the opportunity to make a statement. But this early going is less trailblazing than it is ""Blazing Saddles"" with a landscape full of crackers aghast to see a black man in a position of authority. DiCaprio doesnt show up until an hour in -- as the head of a plantation called Candieland -- and when he does its clear hes here to do exactly what Waltz did in ""Basterds."" He is supposed to be the gentlemanly savage the serpentine charmer. DiCaprio cant do it. He isnt the actor Waltz is and moreover Tarantino doesnt come up with any memorable dialogue for him. Elements of the avenging Shoshanna character from ""Basterds"" meanwhile appear in both Schultz and Django but that movie had more than half a dozen strong characters. This one has four The final one isnt Washington who has little to do but Samuel L. Jackson who makes a major impact as a head slave at the plantation who turns out to be as horrifyingly racist as his boss. Few but Tarantino would have dared to write such a character or to so freely use the N-word which pops up dozens of times appropriately enough given that this is the 1858 South. But not much that happens in the last 45 minutes makes sense which is a big disappointment considering that Tarantinos sense of plot is normally exquisite. This time he relies on lazy contrivances Are we really supposed to believe that at a Southern plantation no one would be able to come up with a good idea on how to torture someone to death? Theres also an unlikely and pointless sacrifice. I can forgive lesser writers for being lazy or sloppy but not the author of ""Pulp Fiction.""

Just when we thought Quentin Tarantino had shown us all the cojones he has in rides ""Django Unchained."" The writer-directors great new western action-drama dares us to stand outside of its issues becoming this seasons see-it-to-believe-it film. (In its repeated use of a racial epithet make that hear it to believe it.) Its a tough movie to admit to liking but also impossible to forget. For as much as ""Lincoln"" watched the wheels of government try to solve the grotesque issue of slavery ""Django"" plants its boots in the mud to confront horror with a wagon full of guts in an artful genre-specific landscape. Tarantino like his lead character somehow comes out stronger. In 1859 German dentist-turned-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) frees a slave named Django (Jamie Foxx) to help find some slave traders Django knows. When he shows a talent for the job and proves himself a great shot he and Schultz become partners and friends. Schultz learns Djangos wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) is owned by vicious plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose favorite entertainment is ""Mandingo fighting"" -- watching slaves fight to the death for sport. Schultz whose hatred of slavery extends to the vile people who propagate it knows Candie wont sell Broomhilda. So he and Django enter Candies Mississippi estate posing as callous Mandingo traders with Broomhildas freedom their ultimate goal. Yet in classic Tarantino style things go blood-red wrong before a gray victory is achieved in this pre-Civil War South. If ""Inglourious Basterds"" the filmmakers similarly bold and loose-limbed historical fantasia was about cinematic wish-fulfillment (""What if Hitler died in a fire?"") ""Django"" willingly stakes out trickier terrain. The movie superficially harkens back to 70s blaxploitation flicks while hewing to western conventions of bigger-than-life revenge legends. Tarantinos title even refers to a 1966 oater that as in ""Basterds"" is referenced in name only. His cast keeps the eye on this meta-approach but transcends it. Foxx is terrific in a role requiring brawn brains dignity and humor. The great Waltz wearing a Texas-sized beard wryly rolls his accent around Tarantinos dialogue as if he were savoring a strudel. DiCaprio is equally strong as a dandified fiend whose repugnant traits include a boyish enthusiasm for evil. Samuel L. Jackson has an even more audacious role Candies butler-confidante who listens as his boss holds a dead slaves skull and spouts nonsense about mental capacity then sips brandy with him complicit in the inhumanity. This all can make for uneasy viewing and the film does stumble in its final showdown failing to find closure beyond its most basic motives. Yet if youre willing to stand for what ""Django"" delivers this rousing magnum opus is so very good at confronting the bad and the ugly.

Theyve had their fill of evil and violence and enough is enough. This would be a shame because Django Unchained clocking in at just under three hours is exactly what you might expect from the fearless controversial director of Pulp Fiction--its overlong raunchy shocking grim exaggerated self-indulgently over-the-top and so politically incorrect it demands a new definition of the term. It is also bold original mesmerizing stylish and one hell of a piece of entertainment. My advice is see it and worry about what youve just seen later. One thing is certain you wont see anything else quite like it any time soon. Mr. Tarantino spent his formative years working as a video store clerk and owns walls full of B-movie schlock he plays in his head from memory. His movies are informed by the assorted fodder that 50s double features were made of. No wonder the films he writes and directs are a mix-and-match hybrid of the cinematic Saturday afternoon genres a lot of us grew up on turned inside out. Last time out his highly acclaimed Inglourious Basterds took on the Nazis in World War II Germany disguised as campy war-movie action stars. Django Unchained takes on the horrors of slavery in the antebellum South disguised as a spaghetti Western. Inspired by a 1966 potboiler called Djangowith Franco Nero as a gunslinger caught between the Ku Klux Klan and a band of Mexican outlaws it transfers the heroics to a slave on a mission to slice and dice every white plantation owner in the Mississippi Delta. The result is so wild you could label it an outrageous spoof of Sergio Leone replete with Ennio Morricone music and hip-hop. Think of it as Gone With the Wind meets Shaft. The best thing about it is the return of Christoph Waltz the dazzling Austrian actor who won an Oscar under Mr. Tarantinos direction as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds. This time he nails the role of Dr. King Schultz a German dentist-turned-bounty-hunter who teams up with a slave he frees named Django (Jamie Foxx). After giving him rigorous instructions on how to shoot stab hang and otherwise permanently maim wanted outlaws for sport and profit Schultz enlists Django as his partner in a series of daring adventures. Armed with a slew of ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" posters theyre off rounding up fugitives who rob stagecoaches and shoot up the range splattering ketchup from the snow-capped mountains. The results are both horrible and humorous as when they ride into town shoot the sheriff dead and then on the verge of being lynched demand a 200 reward because the man was a cattle rustler. Posing as Schultzs valet Django grows from a scared illiterate man-in-rags to a cold-blooded professional assassin fitted in stylish splendor with a trademark hat while secretly nursing a plan to rescue his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from the cruel horsewhip of her master the flamboyant dandified plantation owner pervert and slave auctioneer Calvin Candie (an astounding Leonardo DiCaprio). From here I predict even the most devoted Tarantino fans will recoil from the demeaning repetition of the ""N"" word and some of the sadistic punishments suffered by the slaves are too painful to watch--but the intriguing part of the game is to figure out who will be left standing at the end. To enhance the underlying lust-for-revenge theme that informs every Tarantino movie the director has lured an uncannily gifted cast of performers to his cause. While Mr. Waltz steals the picture with his exquisite manners and withering deadpan humor Samuel L. Jackson raises eyebrows as a poisonous white-haired old plantation servant. (It says volumes about Mr. Tarantinos power that he convinced a militant activist against racism like Mr. Jackson to play a hobblin cussin Stepin Fetchit cliche.) Other amazing faces that populate the lush pre-Civil War settings by the late J. Michael Riva as various mangy varmints Bruce Dern Tom Wopat Michael Parks Don Johnson and even Mr. Tarantino himself. Mr. DiCaprio has a field day playing the effete degenerate villain puffing on a cigarette holder waving a pinky finger and mincing his way through a Southern drawl with a mouth full of whiskey and cotton. The stretch pays off--its probably the closest he will ever get to playing Truman Capote. No question about it. Django Unchained has something guaranteed to offend just about everybody. But with a bigger budget than usual to develop his ideas Mr. Tarantino lives up to his reputation as an independent thinker and a dispenser of vibrant thrilling ideas. This is two movies rolled into one with enough room for one more. You just have to let it roll over you like a bus. You never go away from a Quentin Tarantino movie bored but you might go away from this one blighted blasted and messed up. Who could ask for anything more? rreedobserver.com Running Time 165 minutes Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino Starring Jamie Foxx Don Johnson and Leonardo DiCaprio Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2012/12/the-chain-gang-django-unchained/,200,djangounchained35,djangounchained,com/2012/12/the-chain-gang-django-unchained/

Although not technically a Basterds prequel Django stems from a similar impulse--to reframe and rewrite American history in boldly absurd strokes and by doing so to make us confront the distortions and omissions of so much ""fact-based"" cinema. In Basterds however Tarantino was engaged with an exhaustive canon of World War II movies from Casablanca to Schindlers List while the subject of Django Unchained--slavery in the American South--is one that has been conspicuously absent in Hollywood films in the century since D.W. Griffiths The Birth of a Nation.Of course its a coincidence that Django Unchained arrives in the same season as Steven Spielbergs Lincoln the second of two Spielberg films about slavery (after 1997s Amistad) that never expose audiences to the harsh realities of plantation life? Of course Spielberg is working in a time-honored tradition After The Birth of a Nation with its risible scenes of freed slaves raping and pillaging white Southerners movies have treated this ""peculiar"" institution mostly at arms length from the happy slaves of Gone With the Wind and Song of the South to the simian allegories of King Kong and Planet of the Apes. On network TV special events like Roots and The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman attempted a more honest approach albeit within the censor-imposed limits of prime time good taste. But only one major-studio film of the modern era Richard Fleischers notorious 1975 Mandingo dared to meet slavery on its own terms--a grind house bacchanal of sadism incest and miscegenation capped by an unforgettable finale in which the eponymous bare-knuckle fighter is boiled alive by his master in a cauldron. (Critically reviled but a popular success it is a film Tarantino has spoken of admiringly.)So the boisterous outlandish fiercely intelligent Django Unchained is at once an act of provocation and reparation--not just for slavery but for Hollywoods decades of saintly Negroes and sass-talking sidekicks and its relentless whitewashing of history from Guess Whos Coming to Dinner to The Help. And it will surely be a harder pill to swallow for some of the audiences who cheered at Inglourious Basterds skull-bashing Jewish avengers who might here feel the same white panic 1971 moviegoers suffered when confronted with Melvin Van Peebless Sweet Sweetbacks Baadasssss Song arguably the first black superhero movie.Film Details Django Unchained RatingR GenreDrama Running Time165 More Info First seen in chains after being sold at auction the captured runaway slave Django (Jamie Foxx) finds an unlikely savior in the form of one Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). A German-American dentist-turned-bounty-hunter Schultz needs Djangos help in identifying three wanted men previously employed by Djangos former owner. The time is 1858 three years before the Civil War and the abolitionist-minded Schultz promises freedom to Django--and a share of the bounty--in exchange for his aid. When an actor becomes so closely associated with a character as Waltz did with his polyglot Nazi colonel in Inglourious Basterds it can be a risk for that actor and director to reteam so quickly. But Waltz quickly allays any fears embodying the role with such exuberant theatrical flair--amused by the sound of his own voice smoothing his mustache with a fastidious flick of his fingers--that you cant imagine any other actor doing it.Theres joy in Foxxs playing too and in his chemistry with Waltz as he sheds the scarred skin of Django the slave to take on a series of new more empowering alter egos. This being a Tarantino film the theme of dramatic illusion is central. Schultz and Django dont merely set out on a mission they first ""get into character""--Schultz as a slave trader and Django as his faithful valet--and choose their costumes. Foxx riding to a Tennessee plantation in full Little Lord Fauntleroy regalia ranks among Tarantinos strongest visual gags. Then just as Inglourious Basterds found time to discuss Karl May and his Winnetou novels and the history of German filmmaking under the Nazis Django Unchained pauses for Wagner as Django reveals that he has a wife named Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) in need of rescue and the good German in turn relates the story of Der Ring des Nibelungen. So its on to Valhalla--or as its called here Candyland--a sprawling Mississippi plantation named for its owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).An armchair phrenologist with a foppish burgundy suit and a cigarette holder his nervous eyes darting incestuously at his widowed sister Candie is the least premeditated DiCaprio has ever seemed in a movie--Tarantino has a gift for freeing performers from their self-imposed actorly prisons. But the true revelation of Candyland is Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) a 76-year-old house slave who has served generations of Candies and who has become institutionalized by time his codependent relationship with his master and the small margin of power he wields with perverse pleasure over the other slaves. Brilliantly acted by Jackson Tarantinos longtime muse this alternately deplorable and pitiable character is in some ways the true villain of the piece. Stephen too is playing a role in a giant theater of the absurd and has no intention of leaving the stage willingly.In his past two movies Tarantino has ascended to a new level of filmmaking craftsmanship and narrative sophistication. And yet probably because he came of age in a video store and has never quite lost the autodidacts air of bullish authority some high-minded critics and cultural arbiters cant bring themselves to take him seriously as an intellectual. That was evident in some of the more knee-jerk evaluations of Inglourious Basterds and it is already swirling in the air around Django too. But like all of the best pop art Tarantinos film is both seriously entertaining and seriously thoughtful rattling the cage of race in America on-screen and off the coveted ""freedom papers"" that give Django his emancipation standing in for another black mans long-form birth certificate. So it seems only fitting that when Tarantinos new western hero rides off toward the horizon he is silhouetted not by a sunset but rather a raging ball of Wagnerian fire.

While the movie doesnt take the outrageous narrative leaps of ""Inglorious Basterds"" ""Django"" is nonetheless an intelligent thrill-ride zipping along merrily (and bloodily) until it hits the inevitable Tarantino Act 3 Lag. But even the slow bits cant detract all that much from the wealth of trashy pleasures offered throughout. Jamie Foxx stars as Django a slave purchased (not without a little gunplay) by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) whose traveling-dentist wagon is cover for Dr. Schultzs real profession bounty hunting. Schultz needs Django to ID his quarry three brothers who as it turns out delivered a horrific whipping to Django and his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) when they tried to escape their previous owner. Django takes to the bounty hunting business with no small enthusiasm (""Kill white folks and they pay you for it? Whats not to like?"") although he eventually does discover a pang of conscience along the way. Still his main priority is to find and rescue Broomhilda with Schultzs help which brings them to the plantation of the decadent dandy Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) who trains slaves to fight to the death as sport and entertainment. As is his wont Tarantino mixes flourishes of his favorite old movies (the jarring rapid zooms are right out of Sergio Leone) with his own (blood sprays across every white surface imaginable in this movie from unpicked cotton to snowdrifts -- its surprising he didnt work in a wedding gown as well). There are B-movie legends scattered throughout as well although dont be surprised if you miss some of them; James Russo and Franco Nero (who starred in 1966s unrelated ""Django"") are front and center but I didnt realize that among others Russ Tamblyn and Ted Neeley were in the cast until the closing credits. Foxx gives a fascinating performance -- I dont know that Ive ever seen an ex-slave portrayed as someone with PTSD but it makes perfect sense given everything the character has endured. By the end of the film hes effectively conning white people with any number of fake identities including that of a black slaver whos consulting Schultz on which fighters to buy. Some might dismiss Waltzs utterly entertaining performance as merely a variation on his hyper-articulate and whimsically dangerous villain from ""Basterds"" but thats like complaining that Cary Grants characters in ""My Favorite Wife"" and ""His Girl Friday"" are too suavely similar. Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson pops up toward the end as a duplicitous slave whos more cunning and far less unctuous than he originally appears. The real revelation here is DiCaprio looser and funnier than hes ever been on screen. Turns out hes got a knack for both comedy and villainy and his wonderfully despicable performance here whets the appetite for future ventures in this direction. If Tarantino has a flaw as a filmmaker however its in his sense of pacing and knowing when to leave well enough alone. The films first half or so crackles excitingly establishing the characters and the plot and developing the storyline in a way that never stops moving forward. By the time we reach ""Candie Land"" however things slow down to a crawl and ""Django"" threatens to fritter away all its goodwill. (Its a testament to the strong opening that that never happens.) Plodding through the parts that the filmmaker couldnt bear to trim down (not to mention the is-it-candlelight-or-a-thousand-watt-bulb mansion lighting by cinematographer Robert Richardson) winds up being more than worthwhile however for the many moments of sheer moviegoing pleasure that ""Django Unchained"" provides.

The kids in the window the woman strapped to the tree the citizens in town watching as Django rides in on the horse. The film did a good job of brining me into the reality of that world and illustrating what was normal what was socially unacceptable and what was considered downright insanity. MJsaid on Sunday January 13 2013 44552 PMI saw this movie last month and I loved it. If Tarantinos film gets people to see a movie about slavery then so be it. And now that the nominations came out I think its unfair that Tarantino got nominated for best screenplay but not for best direction - when the entire cast did an excellent job Foxx Waltz DiCaprio Jackson Washington. I agree - one of the best films of the year Steven Freekinsaid on Thursday January 10 2013 61935 PMThe most entertaining hilarious action packed and spectacular film of the year Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the best films of his career. suzannesaid on Tuesday January 08 2013 24524 PMOutstanding film very powerful Lexiesaid on Tuesday January 08 2013 32222 AMAll of the dialogue is uefsul and drowned in meaning/importance. I never felt it ran long perhaps its because I had nachos but I thought this was Tarantinos most daring film and subsequently his best film to date. Nobody will ever make a film like this; Tarantino makes his signature big broad and beautiful. Its un-toppable in regards to the revisionist genre. antonio said on Monday January 07 2013 35231 PMI agreei believe Tarantinos use of the ""n"" word so frequently throughout Django Unchained was more about how deplorable the word really is and its true origins in american history..He wasnt just droppin n bombs for no reasonThere was historical purpose to it..Spike Lee is a moron.. Petersaid on Saturday January 05 2013 80219 PMWhen are you going to release the best movies of 2012 video? Reply from Richard Roeper Peter The videos of Best and Worst Movies of 2012 should be up in a day or two Jo C.said on Friday January 04 2013 123236 PMIm in agreement. Great movie; however why were Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz not nominated for their excellent supporting performances? Erniesaid on Monday December 24 2012 35045 PMI suspect if the director wasnt white the over usage of the ""N"" word wouldnt be a problem. In my lifetime (not very long mind you) I have heard the word used more by African Americans yet its never a problem then. Not ONCE have I heard someone get on a member of that race for using that word. People are too touchy when it comes to that word. If you dont like it fine but dont be a hypocrite. Get on EVERYONE who uses it. And lets not pretend like Quentin Tarantino has a fetish with the word. Its a part of our culture and he has a right to use it just as much as anyone else. There is such a thing as context and it doesnt limit itself exclusively to the ongoing narrative. I dont care if Tarantino uses it five hundred times in thirty minutes. I would rather him use it that many times than hear an actual racist/bigot say it once. It makes all the difference. Sorry didnt mean to make this about race but people give that damn word tooooo much power. Were supposed to be making progress not being uptight about a 70s style exploitation spaghetti western that uses the word a lot. Ive always heard the word portrayed in an accurate light when watching a Tarantino movie. Again its about context. The second we ignore that it remains the unspeakable word that nobody can say. Unless of course if you say it sparingly. Well sorry I dont want a Quentin Tarantino movie to be castrated with restraint. He never holds back and I dont want him to start now.

In his last class cataloged as Inglourious Basterds Tarantino burned down the damn Third Reich Hitler included. This time with Django Unchained he lines up slave traders so a black man can blow their fool heads off. Fuck the facts. Like Sergio Corbucci who directed the first Django (starring Franco Nero) in 1966 Tarantino obeys the only commandment that counts in exploitation movies Anything goes. More News All Stories >> Who else but Tarantino would choose to target human trafficking in the form of a spaghetti Western set in the Deep South two years before the Civil War? And who else would do it to a wowser of a soundtrack that includes a taste of Ennio Morricone a mash-up of James Brown and Tupac Shakur and (a Tarantino rarity) original songs from Rick Ross Anthony Hamilton and John Legend? Django Unchained is literally all over the place. It twists and turns over an unbridled two hours and 45 minutes giving history (and your stamina) a serious pounding. It limps sputters and repeats itself. It explodes with violence and talk talk talk. Tarantinos characters would be lost in the Twitterverse - theres no end to his tasty dialogue. Not that youll care. Youll be having too much fun. Django Unchained is an exhilarating rush outrageously entertaining and hell just plain outrageous. Youll laugh like hell at a KKK scene in which the Klansmen wearing bags on their heads stumble around blindly on their horses because the eyes on their bags have been cut out wrong. Look out for Jonah Hill as Bag Head No. 2. Unchain Tarantino and you get a jolt of pure cinema dazzling disreputable and thrillingly alive. The plot kicks in when Django (Jamie Foxx on low simmer) is bought by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) a German-born dentist-turned-bounty-hunter whose wagon still sports a giant tooth. King is a great Tarantino character. Waltz who won an Oscar for playing Nazi colonel Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds is again spectacular in his blend of mirth and menace. King needs Django to ID the Brittle brothers varmints worth a huge bounty dead or alive. His reward is freedom. But Django needs King to locate his enslaved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). The slaughter starts when Django and King arrive at Bennett Manor where even Big Daddy Bennett (Don Johnson pimped out and loving it) cant stop the Brittle takedown. Job done King advises Django to head off for a more enlightened part of the country. But Django wont rest till he finds his love. And so begins the journey beautifully shot in sun and snow by Robert Richardson. The final destination is Candyland the slave plantation run by Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio having a ball as a charming posturing sociopath who trains Mandingo warriors for sale and sport). Under the supervision of house slave Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) Candie dishes out whippings brandings beatings dog attacks and castration. ""Is that a nigger on a horse?"" asks Stephen rubbing his eyes in disbelief as Django rides in. Jackson the tormented soul of Pulp Fiction is outstanding at locating the complexities in this Uncle Tom with an agenda. At Candyland Django finds Broomhilda nearly dead as punishment for an attempted escape. Django is coiled to spring but holds back during a nerve-shattering dinner scene in which he listens as Candie and Stephen talk of Broomhilda as flesh for use and abuse. When Djangos revenge does come its a gore-splattering doozy. Foxx giving Django his cool-dude props at last morphs into a cowboy John Shaft and opens fire. Theres something here to offend everyone. Revenge fantasies dont leave much room for moral lessons. Django is out for blood. So is Tarantino but he doesnt sacrifice his humanity or conscience to do it. In this corrective to Gone With the Wind he sticks it to Hollywood for a Mandingo-Mammy fixation that leaves the issues of slavery out of mainstream movies. He sticks it to Spike Lee who once objected to Tarantinos use of the n-word in 1997s Jackie Brown by spraying the word like machine-gun fire. And he sticks it to pundits who think he crosses the line by reveling in Djangos vengeance. Wake up people. Tarantino lives to cross the line. Is Django Unchained too much? Damn straight.

They are bought and sold like property torn apart from their loved ones forced to do humiliating or dangerous acts for the amusement of others and the mere appearance of one of them in say a public place can cause men to cuss and women to clutch their pearls. Okay forgive me if I seem flippant about Americas original sin the institution of slavery. But if ""Django Unchained"" a violent whirling fantasia into our dark past does nothing else it ought to rattle some complacent audience members a bit and get them to reflect on history. That it does so with by and large an entertaining and energetic bit of shoot em up vengeance is hardly a bad thing either. The film opens with a classic tense Tarantino talk. Christoph Waltz approaches two slavers dragging a half-dozen new acquisitions through the Texas night. He introduces himself as a dentist named King Schultz (yes thats Dr. King if you want to read it that way) but really hes a bounty hunter. He knows that one of the slaves Jamie Foxxs Django will be able to recognize the three criminal brothers hes looking for. The slavers whose vocabulary is dwarfed by the German-native Schultz dont want to make a deal so thats where the ass-kicking comes in. Schultz is a superhero - silver-tongued and a dead shot a killer with a code. He needs Django and while he doesnt want the taint of slavery on him for now he realizes it is simply easier to own him. ""I feel guilty"" he shrugs and its a laugh line that lights up an audience of conflicted confused 21st century viewers. So for now hes got Django on his team. At first Foxxs Django isnt very charismatic. Hes awakening from the nightmare of slavery and untrusting of the crazy German who kills people for a living. In time though he recognizes that a partnership is the best way for him to find and free his lost wife plus he gets to shoot white people along the way. By the end the torch of badassery is passed to him and he raises it with authenticity. Much like ""Inglorious Basterds"" it is hard at first to sniff out where the main story of ""Django Unchained"" lies. In time well see theres a showdown coming between Schultz and evil plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) and between Django and the whole fking world. Theres plenty of violence in this film. A slave is ripped apart by dogs people are shot in the groin on more than one occasion and then theres DiCaprios savage gladiatorial ""Mandingo fighting"" that our heroes feign business interest in as a ruse to enter DiCaprios trust. Ill admit to ignorance and say I never knew - or sublimated the knowledge of- an underground circuit of slaves forced to fight to the death. Hell perhaps Tarantino is overstating it but knowing the brutality of men Im sure it is true. (The film has a few implications concerning a slave rape trade too that is equally nauseating.) The fighting in ""Django"" mirrors the Russian roulette in ""The Deer Hunter"" - a violent visual motif meant to leave you quaking. ""Django Unchained"" is a long movie and unfortunately only some of the verbal sparring is as tense and clever as in ""Basterds"" (or dare I admit it ""Death Proof."") This film doesnt have quite the pop and polish we expect from Tarantino and I cant help but wonder if the absence of the late Sally Menke Tarantinos longtime editor is the problem. I hope we dont have a pre- and post-Sally Tarantino but right now the evidence points in this direction. There are still plenty of sequences that sizzle theres still the ineffable timing with music but there are also a few points where you might reflect and think ""hey has anything actually happened in the last five minutes?"" There are a few scenes that for lack of a better word are far too normal for the rest of this stylized picture. ""Django Unchained"" is a great discussion piece but Im not sure it is a great film. Enjoyable in a cathartic sense absolutely and perhaps even important considering our amnesiac society. I certainly recommend it despite its loose and disheveled appearances.

Jackson Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture On a Tennessee plantation in 1858 gunshots ring out and a man falls dead in a field his brains splattering blood on the cotton bolls. The victim is a white slaver the killer a black slave -- Django (James Foxx). After Inglourious Basterds in which he endowed World War II Jews with the imaginary power to kill Hitler Quentin Tarantino now frees a black man to take revenge for two centuries of racial humiliation when a crafty German named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) invites the slave to join him as a bounty hunter and eventually to take revenge for the kidnapping of Djangos wife Hildy (Kerry Washington) by a venal gentleman of the antebellum South. ""Kill white folks and they pay you for it?"" he replies. ""Whats not to like?"" ""Whats not to like?"" is a tantalizing question in Django Unchained. The phrase lays out the blithe anachronisms and brazen amusement value of the Pulp Fiction dudes latest tribute-provocation. The sound track of this 19th-century mortality play is peppered with songs from the 1960s and 70s including Richie Havens ""Freedom"" and Jim Croces ""I Got a Name""; the setting may be the Civil War but the aural and visual vibe is distinctly Vietnam-era. And in the splatter-fest category of havent-seen-that-before moments Django dislodges a rider from his mount by blowing holes in the heads of the man and his horse. Its all meant to be in the aid of understanding Americas sad heritage of white men owning and abusing blacks -- as Schultz the one sympathetic white man in the movie acknowledges when he enlists the not-yet-freed Django in the bounty-hunting game. ""For the time being Im going to make this slavery rigamarole work to my advantage. Having said that I feel guilty."" (READ Corlisss review of Pulp Fiction) Tarantino isnt the guilty sort but his films do address dodgy social issues in a tone that veers between examination and exploitation. A clog dance on the knife edge of racism Unchained contains according to Variety ""no fewer than 109 instances of the N word""; and because Tarantino is incapable of a stodgy image it graphically displays black men whipped and tortured or threatened with gelding while hanging naked upside down. One scene -- an extended extreme wrestling bout between two Mandingos -- left members of a preview audience in shocked nearly audible silence as if theyd been tricked into witnessing an atrocity. (SEE The trailer for Django Unchained) The films chief villain the plantation owner Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) is allowed to spout a phrenological treatise on the small brains of African slaves. Candies house slave and consigliere Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) harbors even more malevolence he imprisons Hildy in a ""hot box"" a kind of sauna coffin and would give his life to betray his race and defend his master. Yet some who should know consider the films violence therapeutic yesterday the NAACP nominated Django Unchained for Outstanding Motion Picture in its annual Image Awards. (READ Coverage of the year-end film critics awards) A pastiche thats nearly as funny as it is long (2hr. 45min.) and quite as politically troubling as it may be liberating Django Unchained is pure if not great Tarantino. At 49 after eight features the writer-director has become his own genre running weird violent maniacally elaborate variations on the movies he learned to love as a Manhattan Beach video-store savant a quarter-century ago. He honored and reconstructed the Hong Kong crime drama City on Fire in Reservoir Dogs gave 70s blaxploitation epics a feminismo makeover in Jackie Brown spliced and diced a dozen Shaw Brothers martial-arts films into the Kill Bill diptych revived the auto-eroticism and carnage of grindhouse revenge epics in Death Proof. (READ Corlisss review of Death Proof) The new movie takes its title and some of its particulars from Sergio Corbuccis 1966 spaghetti Western Django whose success spawned dozens of imitators and was itself inspired by Sergio Leones A Fistful of Dollars (1964). Corbuccis antihero (Franco Nero) rode into a lawless town dragging a coffin that contains a machine gun that will make corpses of the men who killed his wife. He also faced down a posse in red hoods -- Ku Klux Klan couture that boasts of its bloody intent -- whom Tarantino turns into proto-Klansmen complaining that they cant see through the eyeholes of their homemade bag-masks. Appropriating the haunting Django theme song composed by Luis Bacalov and sung in full-throated Elvis ballad style by Rocky Roberts Tarantino also gives Nero a cameo When Django spells his name and adds ""The D is silent"" Nero whispers ""I know."" (FIND two Sergio Leone films on the all-TIME 100 Movies list) Tarantino is a longtime Corbucci fan and borrower the ear-cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs is straight from Django (except that in the original the victim is forced to eat his own ear). As Jury President of the 2010 Venice Film Festival Tarantino presided over a Corbucci retrospective. He also did a lusty acting turn in Takashi Miikes nutsy 2007 Japanese tribute Sukiyaki Western Django. In Unchained QT attaches the title of another Corbucci oater Minnesota Clay to a saloon and quotes from Corbuccis Northern Western The Great Silence in which a mute Jean-Louis Trintignant rides through snowy landscapes -- as Foxx and Waltz do here -- on his path to dark destiny. (READ Corliss on Westerns Corbucci-style) References to other Italian oaters abound from the wide screen filled with gigantic closeups of mean men with clenched teeth to snatches of theme songs by Luis Bacalov and the great Ennio Morricone (who contributes a new song here). But you dont need a Ph.D. in Spaghetti Western Studies to detect the mythic and pop-cultural influences on this fever-dream farrago. Hearing Hildys full name -- Broomhilda von Shaft -- will cue the audience to two connections the classic German heroine Brunhilde with Django as her Siegfried and the cool 70s movie cop John Shaft whom Tarantino implicity pegs as Djangos and Hildys great-grandson. (READ A tribute to Italian movie maestro Ennio Morricone) In the subversive pairing of a black and a white man in the Old West Mel Brookss Blazing Saddles may ring a bell or the 1971 sagebrush comedy Skin Game with James Garner and Louis Gossett Jr. as con-men partners. The 70s also spawned some spectacularly lurid melodramas set in the Old South including Mandingo with ex-heavyweight champ Ken Norton as the sex slave of fluttery plantation ladies and the mockumentary Goodbye Uncle Tom in which the directors of Mondo Cane submitted Haitian blacks to nearly as much degradation as their slave forebears. Roger Ebert called the film a ""vomit-bag of racism and perversion-mongering."" (READ Corliss on the Mondo career of Gualtiero Jacopetti) Forty years later Tarantino must believe his depiction will be understood as satire. His virtuosity as a picturemaker and an actors director almost validates that assumption. Waltz who in QTs Inglourious Basterds (another movie named after an Italian action film) earned an Oscar as the Third Reich officer pursuing Jews in France -- the German Javert -- flashes the same orotundity and weaselly charm here but with noble intentions and savvier marksmanship. His Schultz is the viewers modern-voiced guide through mid-19th-century mores as when he explains bounty-hunting by telling Django ""Like slavery its a flesh-for-cash business."" Theoretically supporting Foxx in the title role Waltz doesnt steal the picture; hes handed it and handles the opportunity with effortless craft. (READ Corlisss review of Inglourious Basterds) As in so many Tarantino films the featured players especially the villains get the juiciest roles. Jackson sprung to stardom in Pulp Fiction is creepy-conniving terrific as a slave wielding sick power over his kind. DiCaprio whom Tarantino had first considered for the role eventually taken by Waltz in Inglorious Basterds takes several pages from the Johnny Depp fop book as the Candie man. Flashing his yellow teeth and waving his cigarette holder like the baton of a conductor leading the Ninth Circle of Hell Symphony Orchestra DiCaprio is a jaunty smiling Satan -- and the actors first role in years where he seems to be enjoying himself. He Waltz and Jackson are surrounded by a passel of veteran tough guys from the movies the director loved in his video days (Don Johnson Bruce Dern Michael Parks Robert Carradine M.C. Gainey Tom Wopat) plus Jonah Hill in that incongruous endless jape about the bag-masks and QT himself in two small roles. (READ Belinda Luscombes 10 Questions for Leonardo DiCaprio) So where in Django Unchained is Django? Taking the role intended for Will Smith and playing a rebel within shouting distance of Nat Turner (with a longer life span) the Oscar-winning Foxx is Waltzs sidekick not the star for most of the film. Raised in rags Django dresses as Gainsboroughs Blue Boy when he gets a chance to pick his own couture but the character isnt nearly as colorful. ""Youll be playing a character"" Schultz tells Django as they prepare for their bounty-hunter gig. ""And during the act you can never break character."" Sounds as if Foxx is to follow Daniel Day-Lewiss total-immersion technique. But Tarantino doesnt expend much effort in tracing Djangos arc from slave to gunman to the righteous husband set on revenging the crimes against his wife. Washington has even less to work with a pretty pawn in a stream-set dream sequence. The love story that could be at the movies center gets the most perfunctory treatment. (READ Josh Tyrangiels profile of Jamie Foxx) Thats no surprise. Though Tarantinos first script was called True Romance his fascination lies with the way people articulate their strange passions on the road to violent death. Because the Django character -- unlike Schultz and Candie and Stephen -- has no distinct voice and cant lend rancid eloquence to his feelings he is a cipher right up to the end when he gets to kill white people dozens of them in a vivaciously choreographed blood bath. Django Unchained may not reach the delirious heights of Pulp Fiction; its climactic crimson orgasms lack the emotional gravity of the fatal tilts in Kill Bill. But its undeniably gloriously Tarantino all talk and all action.

Jackson Christoph Waltz Kerry Washington; Director Quentin Tarantino; Release Date Wide 12/25/2012; Runtime (in minutes) 165; MPAA Rating R; Distributor The Weinstein Company Posted January 8 2013 -- 1200 AM EST It would now be a surprise if a new Quentin Tarantino movie didnt dip into the well of 70s grind-house cinema. Django Unchained Tarantinos deliriously kicky and shameless (and also overly long and scattershot) racial-exploitation epic is set in the slave days and among other things its a low-down orgy of flamboyant cruelty and violence whippings a scene in which a man gets torn apart by dogs plus the most promiscuous use of the N-word ever heard in a mainstream movie. Is Django attacking the cruelty or reveling in it? Maybe both and thats what gives the films best parts their danger -- the way that Tarantino with lip-smacking down-and-dirty subversive gusto rubs our noses in the forbidden spectacle of Americas racist ugliness. Whats fun about Django -- at least when it is fun -- is that its also a liberal-hearted revenge Western with a stoically commanding Jamie Foxx in the part of Django a slave who is bought and freed by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) an abolitionist bounty hunter. He wants Django to help him locate and hunt down a handful of the slaves former overseers. Waltz speaking in his German-from-Neptune accent and in cadences so literate theyre a little loopy plays Schultz as a charismatic benevolent oddball and he and Foxx with that smoky and knowing killer gaze make an irresistible buddy team. Yet the films first hour is a little...basic. Theres a funny farcical scene with an early version of the Klan (the joke is they cant see out of their hoods) but Django doesnt spike to full Tarantino fever until it gets inside the big house of Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a wily plantation owner. One of his slaves Broomhilda (a luminous Kerry Washington) is Djangos wife and Schultz and Django now pretend to be slave traders to fool Candie into selling her. DiCaprio having a blast makes Candie the equivalent of Waltzs Nazi in Inglourious Basterds a racist villain who mesmerizes us by elevating his ideology into a puckishly thought-out vision of the world. Yet Django isnt nearly the film that Inglourious was. Its less clever and it doesnt have enough major characters -- or enough of Tarantinos trademark structural ingenuity -- to earn its two-hour-and-45-minute running time. What it does have is Samuel L. Jackson in a pinpoint performance as an unctuous old house slave whos more layered than he appears and when Django Schultz and Candie are sitting around the parlor trying to outwit each other the film achieves that QT hypnotic mood. But only for a while. In the gaudy-bloody last 30 minutes (think over-the-top and beyond) the mood vanishes. And Django Unchained becomes an almost sadistically literal example of exploitation at its most unironic.

Even though its Quentin Tarantinos favorite movie this is wisdom hes never heeded. Bless him for it Django Unchained the directors long-fantasized trek into Sergio Leone Country--by way of Americas racist South of the pre-Civil War era--is filled with the kind of wall-to-wall chat that marks QTs best moments. How can he resist a horse named Fritz who neighs hello on cue? (Even animals get in on the gab.) Why include evil Klansmen if theyre not going to pause for a pre-lynching bitch session about hood making a scene on a par with Reservoir Dogs ""Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy"" argument? And why saddle up for a Western at all if youre not going to create a dazzlingly wrong character like Christoph Waltzs Dr. King Schultz a fur-coated German who rides into the film on a wave of Teutonic-accented attitude? A movie called Django Unchained probably has a guy named Django in it (Ill get to that in a second) but for a good hour or so its not him but Waltzs impressively verbal bounty hunter you notice a foreigner with the chutzpah to partner up with a black man and gallop together into the dark heart of Mississippi. That cohort a former slave with the ""D-is-silent"" moniker of the title (Jamie Foxx) says he can identify Schultzs quarry a trio of scumbag brothers. And so Django does. But the adventure is just getting started as we learn that our budding hero has a wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) sold to an unknown plantation. Schultz is moved--how could a sentimental Siegfried fan not be?--and to the oddly fitting strains of Jim Croces ""I Got a Name"" Tarantino sends his two ramblers out on a quest of revenge and blaxploitation empowerment. Vibrating with the geekery of a filmmaker off the chain the movie plays like no other this year. Tarantino steeped in even the smallest Leonean gesture (whats with the weird terrain shifts?) knows how to satisfy fans of scuzzy Italian horse operas and badass superviolence in equal measure. Yes the bloodshedding is stark especially a slave-on-slave wrestling match that veers into tooth-gnashing desperation. But to his credit Tarantino has a point to make (as he did with the equally loopy Inglourious Basterds) something about the way viciousness can grow within the docile. Throughout his career hes paid close attention to these pushovers all the more dangerous for it; Robert De Niros fuming ex-con in Jackie Brown comes to mind. And here in the sweltering Southland Tarantino has his pick of them. When we meet our ultimate villain white devil Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio clearly enjoying himself) you already suspect another tongue-versus-tongue showdown. Theyre giants these people waging battles of words with the fate of human beings in the balance; Django Unchained isnt far off from Spielbergs talky Lincoln in this regard. The movie loses its slipperiest speechifiers a bit too soon--Foxx more of a symbolic presence is the weak link--but while the conversation rages you cant help but gasp at Tarantinos emancipation proclamation.

The ""D"" is silent though the name of ""Django Unchaineds"" eponymous gunslinger sounds like a retaliatory whip across the face of white slaveholders offering an immensely satisfying taste of antebellum empowerment packaged as spaghetti-Western homage. Christened after a coffin-toting Sergio Corbucci character who metes out bloody justice below the Mason-Dixon line Django joins a too-short list of slaves-turned-heroes in American cinema as this zeitgeist-shaping romp cleverly upgrades the mysterious Man in Black archetype to a formidable Black Man. Once again Quentin Tarantino rides to the Weinsteins rescue delivering a bloody hilarious (and hilariously bloody) Christmas counter-programmer which Sony will unleash abroad. After ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Kill Bill"" it would be reasonable to assume that ""Django Unchained"" is yet another of Tarantinos elaborate revenge fantasies when in fact the film represents the writer-directors first real love story (not counting his ""Badlands""-inspired screenplays for ""True Romance"" and ""Natural Born Killers""). At its core is a slave marriage between Django (Jamie Foxx) and Hildi (Kerry Washington) torn asunder after the couple attempt to escape a spiteful plantation owner (Bruce Dern blink and you miss him). Brutally whipped and then resold to separate bidders on the Greenville Miss. auction block Django and his bride -- whose outrageous full name Broomhilda von Shaft blends epic German legend with the greatest of blaxploitation heroes -- possess a love too great to be shackled by slavery. But getting even with Derns character doesnt feature on Djangos agenda. After settling the score with his former overseers early in the film he cares only about reuniting with his wife. ""Django Unchained"" could also qualify as a buddy movie -- an odd twist considering that Corbuccis original Django was a loner (as played by Franco Nero who cameos in this film). Liberally reinventing a character bastardized in more than 30 unofficial sequels Tarantino pairs this new black Django with a bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Posing as a dentist Waltzs charming figure first emerges in the dead of night driving an absurd-looking carriage with a giant tooth bobbing on top -- the first indication of how funny the film is going to be. As in ""Basterds"" Waltzs genteel manner masks a startling capacity for ruthlessness. This time however hes undeniably one of the good guys. Though he tracks and kills men for a living the doctor is fundamentally fair shooting only when provoked or justified. Happening upon Djangos chain gang Schultz offers to buy the slave from his redneck escorts. When they decline he leaves the traders for dead and liberates their ""property"" enlisting Django in his bounty-hunting business. Tarantinos on sensitive turf here and he knows it using these early scenes not only to establish the cruelty shown toward slaves in the South but also to deliver the same sort of revisionist comeuppance Jewish soldiers took upon Hitler in his last picture. Ironically as a well-read and clearly more enlightened German Schultz is disapproving of Americans claims to racial superiority which positions him as the storys moral conscience. When the time comes he will accompany Django to Candyland the plantation where Hildi now resides under the thumb of the unctuous Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). But the film seems to be in no hurry to get there focusing on Djangos most unusual education -- killing white men -- for the first 90 minutes of the directors longest feature yet. Tarantino freely quotes from his favorite stylistic sources whether oaters or otherwise featuring lightning-quick zooms an insert of unpicked cotton drenched in blood and a shot of Django riding into town framed through a hangmans noose. Early on Foxx appears to be following Waltzs lead but once the snow melts on the bounty-hunting subplot (an extended homage to Corbuccis ""The Great Silence"") all traces of subservience disappear and Foxx steps forth guiding this triumphant folk hero through a stunning transformation. True to its spaghetti-Western roots the pic reveals most of its stoic heros unspoken motivations through garishly colored flashbacks though Tarantino and editor Fred Raskin (stepping in for the late Sally Menke) seem to realize that limited glimpses of such white-on-black sadism go a long way. Filmmakers who choose to portray this shameful chapter of Americas past bear a certain responsibility not to sanitize it. But here even as it lays the groundwork for ""Djangos"" vengeance dwelling on such brutality can verge on exploitation. To wit the film problematically features no fewer than 109 instances of the ""N word"" most of them deployed either for laughs or alliteration. While good taste doesnt necessarily apply comedy seems to be the key that distinguishes ""Django Unchained"" from a risible film like ""Mandingo."" Both take a certain horror-pleasure in watching bare-chested black men wrestle to the death -- the sick sport at which Candie prides himself an expert -- but what better way to inoculate the power of a Klan rally than by turning it into a Mel Brooks routine reducing bigots to buffoons as they argue about their ill-fitting white hoods? Using rap and other cheeky music cues to similar effect the script repeatedly finds ways to use the characters racism against them most ingeniously in its somewhat protracted second half. According to Schultz if he and Django were to show up at Candyland and offer to buy Hildi directly theyd be laughed off the plantation so they hatch a plan to pose as men looking to buy a mandingo fighter. But theres a flaw to their logic since the direct-request approach worked fine with Don Johnsons ""Big Daddy"" earlier it allows the film to explore the complex caste system among slaves. There are two things Tarantino as a director has virtually perfected -- staging Mexican standoffs and spinning dialogue for delayed gratification -- and expert examples of both await at Candyland. Seductively revealing a dark side auds have never seen before DiCaprio plays Candie as a self-entitled brat spewing the characters white-supremacy theories through tobacco-stained teeth. Like a Southern despot he surrounds himself with menacing cohorts none more dangerous than old Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) who runs the affairs of Candies household and represents a form of toxic black-on-black rivalry still smoldering in American culture today. Gorgeously lit and lensed by Robert Richardson against authentic American landscapes (as opposed to the Italian soil Corbucci used) the film pays breathtaking respect not just to Tarantinos many cinematic influences but to the country itself envisioning a way out of the slavery mess it depicts. In sheer formal terms ""Django Unchained"" is rich enough to reward multiple viewings while thematics will make this thorny ""southern"" -- as the director aptly dubs it -- perhaps his most closely studied work. Of particular interest will be Tarantinos two cameos one delivered with an Australian accent and the other alongside Jonah Hill in the ""baghead"" scene. Django UnchainedProductionA Weinstein Co.

Thats certainly true of Django (Jamie Foxx) a black slave in the antebellum South freed from bondage by German dentist-turned-bounty hunter Dr. King Schulz (Christoph Waltz) in the opening moments of ""Django Unchained"" Tarantinos latest erratically fun and uneven tribute to the movies he loves and the discursive writing style he adores even more. The filmmakers seventh feature plays like looser dust-caked sibling to ""Inglorious Basterds"" his last rambunctious attempt to rile up history with a rebellious sense of play. Just as he unearthed ""the face of Jewish vengeance"" in ""Basterds"" Tarantino relishes the opportunity to run wild with a symbol of black persecution until the idea loses momentum -- and then true to form he just keeps going. Tarantinos fundamental inspiration stems from the original 1966 shoot-em-up ""Django"" a precedent rendered in obvious terms from the opening credits when the bouncy theme song from Sergio Corbuccis classic spaghetti western makes its first appearance. However many other films of varying quality were made using the ""Django"" moniker over the years and Tarantinos appropriation of the brand smartly capitalizes on its malleability by turning western mythology inside out. At times more in line with ""Blazing Saddles"" than the grimly bawdy qualities that define many bonafide oaters ""Django Unchained"" erupts with a conceptual brilliance from the outset that never fully meshes with its clumsy storyline. Nevertheless its a giddy ride. Initially just astonished when hes suddenly taken from captivity by Dr. King (subtle) Django quickly grows into the role of fearless avenger in a racist society that constantly expects him to conform. After accompanying the bounty hunter on a pair of successful outings to take down heartless wanted (and white) criminals Django accepts the cunning Dr. Kings offer to join forces for the season. In exchange the German offers to help rescue Djangos enslaved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington in a role that asks her to do little more than bat her eyelashes and scream when the occasion calls for it). That arrangement sets the pieces in motion for a riotous buddy comedy in which the duo capture plenty of bounty before hurtling toward their final target wealthy plantation owner Calvin Candy (Leonardo DiCaprio over the top even by these standards) who keeps Broomhilda locked up in a dismal existence at the appropriately-titled Candyland. That arc might provide enough material for a tightly wound epic but Tarantino mostly uses it to establish a general scenario and then push the pieces around. While no longer a villain akin to the Nazi overlord he played in ""Basterds"" Waltz brings the same mixture of smarminess and verbose delivery that defined that Oscar-winning achievement giving the impression that his curiously literate persona exists out of time. Django meanwhile defines it; Foxx delivers an impressively subdued turn that embodies the rage of the characters generation. Positioning both of them as vessels for Tarantinos window into western iconography he loads up their adventures with ample reference points at every step along the way. Aficionados of spaghetti westerns in general and Sergio Corbuccis movies in particular will relish the opportunities to pick through the easter eggs which range from passing allusions (a cameo by original ""Django"" star Franco Nero a saloon named for Corbuccis ""Minnesota Clay"") to subtler qualities funneled into the storys DNA. (The notion of a German bounty hunter in the Old West only makes sense I think in relation to the several spaghetti western roles played by German actor Klaus Kinski; the surname of Djangos wife pays homage to blaxploitation hero John Shaft a rather brilliant means of bridging the gap between the far-reaching genre traditions that Tarantino loves). Overall its easy to appreciate the screwy lurid atmosphere but even as Tarantinos enthusiasm is characteristically infectious it eventually grows tiresome.Basically the experience boils down to this Accept ""Django Unchained"" on its own gonzo terms and its a marvelously enjoyable piece of subversive entertainment -- for a little while. The initial 70-odd minutes rival ""Basterds"" for successfully blending self-serious allusions to other movies loopy monologues riddled with irreverent asides and comic outbursts of violence into a delightfully off-kilter mash-up that comes across as Tarantino saluting his own connoisseurship. As with ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Kill Bill"" cinematographer Robert Richardsons loud color schemes and retro camerawork nicely compliment the cartoon logic as does the vivid soundtrack. Also like ""Basterds"" Tarantino strengthens his predilection for cinematic pastiche by translating unseemly historical imagery into zany fantasy. While this may constitute his overall weakest picture to date its not devoid of the elements that make his rambunctious genre exercises so crazily memorable. Tarantinos movies work best when you know what to expect of them and to appreciate its random assortment of monologues and reference points for what they truly are a lively collage of familiar ingredients enlivened by farcical style and characters who follow suit. Hence a prolonged bit involving Ku Klux Klan members chasing Dr. King and Django but doomed by poorly-cut eyeholes in their hoods makes for Tarantinos funniest piece of writing to date. Elsewhere Dr. Kings fish-out-of-water presence provides a witty commentary on the extremes of the era injecting the story with a wry contemporary voice. ""For the time being Im going to make this slavery rigamarole work to my advantage"" he tells Django when he technically purchases the man after killing his former owners. ""Having said that I feel guilty."" Tarantino however positions his comedy without a twinge of guilt. The great equalizer of racial tensions he turns potentially boundary-pushing humor into an all-inclusive experience. When Calvin Candys servant explains his role in maintaining the estate Django replies that the white man is ""almost like a nigger"" a bold remark punctuated with one of several ostentatious zooms lifted from the spaghetti western vernacular -- allowing for yet another moment of unlikely humor. However much of what makes ""Django Unchained"" so energizing right out of the gate is ruined by an overindulgence of those same ingredients during the bloated second half. Theres so much to admire about the movie that I had to see it twice to soak in the minutiae of Tarantinos stabs at showmanship. But none of that changes the terribly drawn-out scenes taking place on Candys plantation as Tarantino gradually trounces on his initial exuberance with redundancies. DiCaprios uneven performance as the main villain never takes on enough definition to seem necessary in the already cluttered plot. Once he arrives the movie stalls for a good hour as Django winds up in a clandestine attempt to win back his wife. ""You had my curiosity"" Candy tells the men when they make an offer on his land as part of an elaborate plan to win back Broomhilda. ""Now you have my attention."" Thats an apt description of the impact ""Django Unchained"" maintains until it slows down only regaining excitement with the gloriously chaotic and blood-soaked finale. Before that happens Tarantino is hampered by strange choices setting an admittedly first-rate soundtrack of western ditties and hip-hop to useless slo-mo montages while the mounting suspense between Candy and his two visitors rings hollow. A prolonged dinner scene wastes time with little payoff and the explosive finale arrives with hardly much surprise. While uninspired Djangos concluding assault on Candyland is an immensely watchable affair. Ill keep the details vague but suffice to say the closing set piece involves dynamite horses speedy gun-twirling antics and a whole lot of blood all the ingredients necessary to remind us that Tarantino packs a wallop even when firing blanks. This one overstays its welcome but not before the filmmaker reminds us why we love him. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? The Weinstein Company releases ""Django Unchained"" on Christmas Day where it will directly compete with ""Les Miserables"" at the box office. Reviews will likely be mixed but enough positive buzz and existing enthusiasm for the project should help it find a way to healthy returns. It faces uneasy awards season propositions but Tarantinos screenplay stands a chance at gaining some accolades in that department.

Reply Nathan May 12 2016 243 pm I completely disagree with this. The best part of the whole movie is once DiCaprio shows up. From that moment on the dialogue is truly brilliant the performances (especially DiCaprio and Waltz) are outstanding and I was just glued to the screen. The entire second hours plays like an extended version of the basement scene in Inglorious Basterds (my favorite part of that whole movie) and the tension is palpable. The character of Calvin Candie is one of the most complicated interesting and multidimensional villains in memory. I mean I love Silva in Skyfall but he has got nothing on the complexity of this character (who is mostly a businessman). Glade you mostly liked the film but the part of it you are knocking is the best part because its the most dramatic. Tarantino says a lot about slavery here but it seems you were more interested in the jokes and the movie references. It is certainly funny but its also painful as well. Brilliant work.

TWITTER Christoph Waltz Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio star in Quentin Tarantinos revenge saga mostly set in the Deep South just before the Civil War. History gets another dramatic rewrite Quentin Tarantino-style in Django Unchained a jokey discursive idiosyncratic and spirited film that does to slave owners what Inglourious Basterds did to Nazis. Applying the episodic format and visual template of classic and spaghetti Westerns to a revenge saga mostly set in the Deep South just before the Civil War the film makes a point of pushing the savagery of slavery to the forefront but does so in a way that rather amazingly dovetails with the heightened historical stylistic and comic sensibilities at play. The anecdotal odyssey-like structure of this long talky saga could be considered indulgent but Tarantino injects the weighty material with so many jocular startling and unexpected touches that its constantly stimulating. A stellar cast and strong action and comedy elements will attract a good-sized audience internationally though distaste for the subject matter and the irreverent take on a tragic subject might make some prospective viewers hesitate. Tarantinos affinity for black culture and interest in the ways blacks and whites relate always have been evident but theyve never before been front and center to the extent that they are in Django Unchained. Some might object to the writer-directors tone historical liberties comic japes or other issues but there can be no question who gets the shaft here This is a story of justifiable vengeance pure and simple and no paleface is spared even the good German who facilitates a slaves transformation into a take-no-prisoners hunter of whites who trade in black flesh. At its core then the film entirely shares its raison detre with Basterds which climaxed with a conflagration that fancifully obliterated the Nazi regime. Its presented however as a lengthy journey one that feels -- both in its equivalent running time and luxuriant magnification of arguably incidental matters -- quite like Sergio Leones great The Good the Bad and the Ugly. All the same a lesser-known Italian director of many Westerns Sergio Corbucci is Tarantinos declared touchstone here. Corbucci made the original Django starring Franco Nero in 1966 after which there were dozens of unofficial sequels though none made by Corbucci. (Nero makes a brief appearance here and in the spirit of European credit lines for famous actors playing small roles in movies Tarantino amusingly employs the literal translation ""With the friendly participation of Franco Nero."") STORY Director Roundtable 6 Auteurs on Tantrums Crazy Actors and Quitting While Theyre Ahead Imprinting at once his 60s archivist sympathies via the use of an old Columbia Pictures logo bright red opening credits backed by a self-consciously cornball Western song and a lead-in title announcing that its 1858 ""somewhere in Texas"" Tarantino makes anachronistic use of a few spring-loaded zoom shots to introduce Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz in flowing salt-and-pepper locks and beard) a German bounty hunter posing as an itinerant dentist as advertised by a large molar that jiggles on a spring atop his small wagon. Unlike most men of the Old West Schultz is an Old World man of many words rarely using one where four or five will do as he articulately and amusingly explains himself to a succession of skeptical and well-armed ruffians. After considerable verbal ado he takes down the leaders of a chain gang of slaves one of whom Django (Jamie Foxx) can identify the notorious Brittle Brothers for whom Schultz hopes to collect the considerable reward. Freeing the slave from his shackles the impeccably mannered Schultz is polite and businesslike with the bedraggled Django in a way the latter certainly has never experienced putting him on a horse offering him 25 per brother if they find them and brazenly marching him into a saloon in the next town they hit to the gaping astonishment of the locals. Expressing the characters confidence in his intelligence and a hucksters delight in his skill at the con Waltz gives a wonderfully large performance that breathes life into the film from the start. There might in fact be an element of fair play in Tarantino making Waltzs German an exemplary fellow this time around after the actors villainous Nazi turn in Basterds for which he won a supporting actor Oscar. These initial passages serve to communicate how alarming it is in this context for whites to see ""a n----- on a horse."" But this is just an appetizer for what white folks will end up encountering at Djangos hands before hes done serving up his just deserts using the man-hunting skills taught him by Schultz. In a heart-to-heart Django reveals that his wife was sold away to another master but of particular interest to Schultz is the news that her name is Broomhilda (or so the reliably idiosyncratic speller Tarantino presents it) and that she speaks German as she was raised by people from the old country. After Schultz explains the significance of her name Django resolves to become his wifes Siegfried to slay the dragon that is her evil master and rescue his bride. Only Tarantino could come up with such a wild cross-cultural mash a smorgasbord of ingredients stemming from spaghetti Westerns German legend historical slavery modern rap music proto-Ku Klux Klan fashion an assembly of 60s and 70s character actors and a leading couple meant to be the distant forebears of blaxploitation hero John Shaft and make it not only digestible but actually pretty delicious. Some of it is over-the-top nutty and a few things -- like a mass argument that sounds like a bunch of modern Californians nattering at one another -- come off as rather silly. But much of it is inspired or close to it just as the underlying outrage at the fact that slavery even existed in this country until 148 years ago is well and truly felt. VIDEO Comic-Con 2012 Django Unchaineds Christoph Waltz on Exploring Slaverys Relevance to Todays Mentality Quite naturally given the historical setting the N-word gets a heavy workout by whites and blacks alike. But much more forceful is the cruelty dispensed by the Southern whites both as punishment and whim; attack dogs are unleashed on one man Mandingo fighters (in an homage to the unforgettable 1975 Mandingo) battle to the death in a beautifully appointed drawing room for the wealthys amusement a woman is locked naked in a metal ""hot box"" genital mutilation is arranged for a man and much more. For all the films genre hopping and playful spirit this dead-serious foundation is never far from sight. As Sonny Chiba said in Kill Bill Vol. 1 ""Revenge is never a straight line."" And so it is here as the unlikely pair of Schultz and Django rack up quite a fortune in bounties to finance their scheme to buy back Broomhilda from her owner Southern scion Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) a smooth-talking elegant young gentleman who welcomes Schultz to his vast plantation Candyland even if he can scarcely tolerate the presence of his black partner -- who by now has traded in his ludicrous bright blue Little Lord Fauntleroy suit for the leather hat and sunglasses of a fancy-pants cowboy. Django seethes in silence as the whites discuss business and pleasure over a long dinner. In the process the films focus shifts to Candie whom DiCaprio plays with more relish than hes brought to a part in some time and Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson) his old house slave whose combination of obsequiousness and diabolical shrewdness makes him a vivid character. Jacksons appearance at first provokes a double-take -- hes somewhat stooped filled out in the jowl and bald save for tufts of white hair on top and on the sides -- but the Tarantino regular astutely judges just how far to push the jivey dialogue that offsets the subservient nature of the role. When Jackson is onscreen its impossible to take your eyes off him. The films greatest problem is that especially in the second half the Django character gets a bit lost in the shuffle; he doesnt pop from the screen the way Schultz Candie and Stephen do. Django is all about being resolute and determined but more detail could have filled out the characters transformation from downtrodden slave to steely master gunfighter. Schultz teaches him about Siegfried and firearms but the long-journey format could have nicely accommodated a fuller more gradual account of the expansion of Djangos mind and horizons; as it is he lurches from impotent nonperson to cocky dude too abruptly. Its true that cowboy and genre characters neednt be deep but because the other characters get most of the good lines Django could have used something they dont have an extra dimension. Foxx doesnt project the sort of charisma that the lucky few have to rivet audience attention even when theyre doing nothing so when hes not the center of attention he seems withdrawn and not that interesting. STORY Feinberg Forecast Updated Projections (With 12 Weeks Until the 85th Oscars) As hes done before Tarantino has peppered the huge cast with actors whose heydays date back as far as the 60s; mostly they play cretinous types and show up just long enough to be recognized before getting killed. Among them are Bruce Dern Russ Tamblyn James Remar Dennis Christopher James Russo Don Stroud Tom Wopat M.C. Gainey Robert Carradine Ted Neeley Tom Savini and Michael Parks; Tarantino himself also plays one of these lowlifes. Don Johnson clearly relishes his scenes as a Tennessee plantation Big Daddy whose efforts to launch an early KKK-like raiding party prove inept while Jonah Hill looks predictably out of place during his few seconds of screen time. Veteran production designer J. Michael Riva died during filming but his fine hand particularly shows in the detailed interiors for Candyland and a New Orleans brothel. Robert Richardsons cinematography is elegant and rugged as needed. Costume designer Sharen Davis has opportunities for some fun both with Djangos developing wardrobe and Schultzs finery which includes a suit and cape that prefigures that of Sherlock Holmes. This is the directors first film without his invaluable editor the late Sally Menke but Fred Raskin an assistant editor on the Kill Bill films has filled in capably. As always with Tarantino the soundtrack is a wildly eclectic thing. Spaghetti Western scoring master Ennio Morricone is represented by eight tracks some recycled and one original song while theres also rap and more contemporary sounds from the likes of James Brown and 2Pac -- together in ""Unchained (The Payback/Untouchable)"" -- and Rick Ross as well as ""Django (Main Theme)"" by Luis Enriquez Bacalov and Rocky Roberts.
