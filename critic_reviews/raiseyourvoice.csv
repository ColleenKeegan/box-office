Terri learns shes been accepted into a ""prestigious"" performing-arts program on the West Coast--apparently the academys admissions office was charmed by Pauls homemade movie about Terris positive attitude complete with footage of the aspiring chanteuse warbling into a hairbrush. She heads to L.A. where she encounters a host of catty classmates and a rocky romance with dreamy singer-songwriter Jay (James). If youre not put off by the vocal stylings of its ubiquitous starlet youll probably find this innocuous tweener fare bearable.

This is for Duffs already committed audiences which presumably consist of the young the innocent and the commercially acquisitive. Far be it from me to stand between two interested parties. She plays Teri Fletcher a 16-year-old church-going musically ambitious daughter of an overprotective father (David Keith) and a gentle mom (Rita Wilson) and the sib to an impossibly wonderful brother. When a disturbing tragedy occurs Teris desire to attend a musical academys summer program in Los Angeles is hampered by her traumatized feelings. And then theres Dad who forbids her to go. A plucky lass with a powerful voice and a will to go should follow her dreams right? Mom and Teris aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) conspire behind Dads back to make it happen. _____More in Movies_____  Raise Your Voice Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movies Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now What follows is part ""Fame"" and all Hilary all the time as she makes friends learns life lessons sings and enjoys a bubblegum-ish romance with a sweet-natured fellow student (Oliver James).

Would you please pipe down? Hilary Duff makes not-so-beautiful music with Oliver James in Raise Your Voice. New Line Cinema Now Hilary Duff is back to prove that she doesnt need skanky stepsisters to help her deliver another movie on a horse-drawn coach ride to cable. In Raise Your Voice Duff plays an Arizona teen selected to attend the summer program at a prestigious music school which recalls Groucho Marxs famed remark about not wanting to belong to any club that would have him as a member. About the movie Raise Your Voice  1/2 (out of four) Stars Hilary Duff Oliver James David Keith Rita Wilson Rebecca De Mornay John Corbett Directors Sean McNamara Distributor New Line Cinema Rated PG for thematic elements and language. Opens Friday nationwide Against her participation in the program is Duffs dour dad (toothpick-chewing David Keith) who seems to have a boil in a really bad place whenever talk turns to the school and the so-called L.A. scene that he fears the school typifies. Mom (Rita Wilson) disagrees especially after Duffs older brother is fatally blindsided by a truck. (Actor tears flow heavily in the first 20 minutes.) And Wilsons dissent is shared by Keiths own artsy/bohemian sister (Rebecca De Mornay). Shes an aunt who still knows how to wear blue jeans. To aid niece Duff De Mornay becomes an accomplice in moms hatched plot a mock month-long visit with De Mornay thats really a secret detour to the school. There Duff meets a pouty rival sporting a top that reads ""Daddys girl"" and a bald middle-aged instructor who inexplicably talks like Dracula. Actor John Corbett so clean-cut in My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Raising Helen goes surprisingly scruffy here as someone who apparently studied music under Grizzly Adams. Duff hits one or two more notes than acting expressions puppy-loving it with a Brit (Oliver James) in what could pass for deleted scenes from Fame. If New Line could find a way to recruit the youthful wisecrackers at my screening and take them out on the road to every showing they might wangle a word-of-mouth hit. Otherwise even the kindest reaction to Raise My Voice is likely to be ""shut your face.""

Photo (c) 2004 Zade Rosenthal/New Line ... more Photo Zade Rosenthal She can belt out a tune and just wants to be a star 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Raise Your Voice Drama Starring Hilary Duff Oliver James Jason Ritter John Corbett and David Keith. Directed by Sean McNamara. (PG. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Raise Your Voice"" raises the bar for movies geared to teens. Its particularly good at capturing that time of life when you simultaneously believe everything is possible and that each tiny misstep is the end of the world. The characters students at a music conservatory are imbued with recognizably human traits such as insecurity and jealousy instead of being portrayed as Stepford kids more typical in this type movie. Hilary Duff stars as Terri Fletcher a small-town nobody determined to win the schools grand prize a 10000 scholarship. Duff is as appealing on the big screen as the small one and she really can sing -- a plus considering the plot hinges on her being able to belt out a tune. Although very 21st century Duff has a little bit of Jane Powell in her a fragility combined with a fierce sense of knowing where shes going. Its a winning mix to make her character believable and to get everyone rooting for her. Theres nothing original about the story which borrows liberally from ""Fame"" and even that old war horse ""42nd Street."" But director Sean McNamara who toiled for years at the Disney Channel obviously knows how to appeal to this generation of young people. His movie feels fresh despite a heavy use of cliches -- including the de rigueur moment when it looks as if Terri will miss her chance in the spotlight. Los Angeles is used rather than New York as the big city where Terri has to prove herself. To make the big-pond idea plausible she arrives at a train station dense with passengers. The comparatively limited Los Angeles skyline is photographed at night from every possible angle until it appears to contain more tall buildings than Manhattan and Chicago combined. The joke is that were Terri to venture into the neighborhoods she would find them remarkably similar to where she grew up in Flagstaff Ariz. Terri comes from a ""Father Knows Best"" family. This being the present the dad (overplayed by David Keith whose grimaces meant to express anger have all the subtlety of a soap opera villain) isnt as wise as he thinks he is. He forbids Terri to attend the conservatory even though its only for a summer. But a family tragedy makes it possible for her to deceive him by pretending to stay with an aunt while secretly heading for the bright lights of Los Angeles. These early scenes at the Fletcher homestead feel stilted and forced. But ""Raise Your Voice"" comes alive when Terri arrives at the Bristol-Hilman Conservatory the music worlds equivalent of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Certainly the conservatory boasts as many eccentric teachers led by Mr. Torvald a name right out of ""Harry Potter."" Torvald (""Sex and the Citys"" John Corbett) recognizes Terris talent even when grief prevents her from performing at her best. Bearded and scruffy looking Corbett is so mellow in the role he seems to be channeling Jeff Bridges ""Big Lebowski."" Terris fellow students are as eccentric as the teaching staff. Theyre lost in their music convinced that creative endeavors will lead to happiness instead of the penury that surely awaits most of them. Terri has to fall in love to complete the picture. The lucky guy Jay (Oliver James giving a charming performance) has a British accent and talents that mesh with hers. Jay writes songs and is practically Liberace at the keyboard. Everything is set up for the two to make beautiful music together and they do after the resolution of assorted misunderstandings between Jay and his former girlfriend and Terri and her dad. All the students get to show what they can do in a finale that could easily have resembled the talent competition in the ""Miss America"" contest except that the young actors display real musical gifts. Youre honestly happy to hear them raise their voices.

Raise Your Voice Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/raise-your-voice-2004,200,raiseyourvoice12,raiseyourvoice,rogerebert
"Voice rises to dazzling heights of badness - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Voice rises to dazzling heights of badness By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 8 2004 The problem with most bad movies about aspiring talents is that not enough of them as Ed McMahon used to say ""reach for the stars -- and catch em."" Occasionally were lucky enough to get a movie of such dazzling pomposity (the ballet-school drama ""Center Stage"") or spectacular atrocity (""Glitter"") that its tough to watch underachievers such as ""From Justin to Kelly"" ""Honey"" or ""You Got Served"" without shedding a tear for the missed opportunity.But that also makes it easier to spot a timeless classic when it emerges. The new Hilary Duff movie ""Raise Your Voice"" doesnt simply reach for the stars it grabs at them like they were free keychains at a college recruitment meeting. The movie is the most fun kind of terrible.It chronicles the rise of Terri Fletcher from meek Arizona teen dreamer to participant in a premier performing arts program in Los Angeles where for one August her mettle and her thin bland voice will be put to the test where she will blossom into -- drum roll please -- Hilary Duff.But before Terri is transformed from an uncertain moth into the sort of self-confident butterfly who aces the squat-and-sing (is there even a class for that?) she will have to cope with the death of her supportive brother (Jason Ritter) deceive her forbidding father (David Keith) and learn to take her dubious songwriting gifts to their sappiest-ever extremes.She also has to be crafty about the three-way phone calls between herself her parents (Rita Wilson is Mom) and her merlot-swilling sculptress aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) whom shes pretending to stay with so her father doesnt have a nuclear meltdown. (Dad tried to make it in LA and failed.)There are tears fears and Terri falling head over heels for Jay (Oliver James) the programs guitar-playing Don Juan or more appropriately its John Mayer. James incidentally is the same dude who loved up rival tween royal Amanda Bynes in ""What a Girl Wants."" In ""Raise Your Voice"" Jay once had a fling with Robin (Lauren C. Mayhew) who with her blond tendrils and bitterness gives the proceedings a touch of Elizabeth Berkley in ""Showgirls."" But this movie isnt trolling for trash (nobody likes Robin) and its unafraid to be square It swears that Duff is a truly moving talent.Thats a galling suggestion but the movie wouldnt be as blissfully bad were Terri the only person who believed in herself. Written by Sam Schreiber and directed by Sean McNamara this is a vehicle preposterously devoted to its star. Before he dies her brother says ""You have the best voice I have ever heard."" John Corbett (as the schools hairiest teacher) even gives Terri a solo -- in Handels ""Messiah.""Unlike ""Fame"" last years ""Camp"" or even to some extent ""The Turning Point"" the kids in ""Raise Your Voice"" have self-esteem that scrapes the sky. Theyre ambitious but not unbearably obnoxious. (Except you Robin. Youre unbearable.) In fact Terris sassy roommate Denise (Dana Davis) is all business. Shes the Poor Black Girl who has to bag groceries and play her violin for money to make ends meet.This music program is filled with people who look like punks skaters hip-hoppers stoners Rastas sluts and Goths. But ""Raise Your Voice"" believes in a teen monolith in the same way that Clear Channel suggests there is but one radio station. And what a well-harmonized monolith it isMore than once were treated to a schoolyard jam-along. One person starts playing an instrument then the whole place playing every instrument known to man joins in. Robin hears Jay on guitar and says ""Hey Jay nice hook"" And Jay says ""Jump in and pick it up"" which she does ""Ooo-ooo-ooo yeah"" The camera starts going crazy to get it all as if the only way to capture the buxom blonde holding the saxophone is sideways. Were the Muppets ever this excited to rock out?The movies enthusiasm is as indelible and shiny as the lip gloss its star wears to bed. I just wish I liked Duff more. Even when she seems on top of the world she always holds her tummy and looks a little worried like a person whos just eaten a burrito thats not sitting well. In the end Duffs Terri knows what she has to do if shes going to win the programs scholarship rule a talent show. She takes the stage and belts out some mean Radio Disney. The performance is south of mediocre but you still feel like youre witnessing a peculiar triumph of the human spirit. That or the ongoing ascent of an entertainment-biz concoction. Its hard to say. Either way my lighters in the air.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.Raise Your Voice (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Jason Ritter who is so sympathetic on CBSs ""Joan of Arcadia"" as the wheelchair-using brother of the teenage heroine takes a step toward typecasting as Ms. Duffs brother who is in a terrible car accident. John Corbett is typically delightful as the cool spontaneous music professor. And Kat Dennings who has a small part as Sloane the sullen piano student may be the next Lili Taylor if such a thing is possible.But ""Raise Your Voice"" is all about Ms. Duff 17 who has been a star since her ""Lizzie McGuire"" television series began in 2001. As Terri Fletcher shes so adorable that the camera cant take its eye off her. When Terri sings she redefines the word pep; her adoring brother cant resist videotaping her. The only thing shes unhappy about is possibly spending the rest of her life in her unexciting Arizona hometown.When tragedy strikes her family though Terri loses her voice and a good bit of her will to live. The only thing that might snap her out of it would be attending a very selective summer music program in Los Angeles but her father (David Keith) the token hardheaded adult says no. It takes outright deception and the help of a free-spirited aunt (Rebecca De Mornay) to pull it off.The predictable notions keep coming. Dad objects to California because in his youth he had a friend who went to U.C.L.A. on a scholarship got caught up in ""the L.A. scene"" and had his life ruined in some unspecified way. For Terri the big city lives up to its bad reputation at first. The minute she arrives at Union Station her jacket is stolen. (At least it isnt her luggage.) The big-city kids are snide; her assigned roommate dismisses her as ""some kind of retro Brady Buncher.""But when she meets a boy its a perfect match he writes terrible lyrics (""Sunlight in your hair/makes my heart jump in the air"") and she does terrible arrangements. Chances are good that Terri will find her voice again teach her parents a lesson about something (proving in the tradition of this genre that teenagers are smarter than their elders) and get the guy.Thinking adults wont find much of ""Raise Your Voice"" worth their time but Ms. Duffs screen presence and the films infectious high spirits will make this piece of fluff appealing to young moviegoers without conveying any sinister messages -- except the suggestion that soul-crushing grief can be ""cured"" in the short space of a summer. If youre going to throw a lot of good-looking teenagers together and have them make music as a group better this than the beach party movies of yesteryear. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Raise Your Voice"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has one brief but upsetting car crash and a couple of makeout scenes.

Item which falls well short of a ""Fame"" for the new millennium should perform solidly at the B.O. ""Raise Your Voice"" resurrects the teen empowerment-through creative-expression genre and though it brings little new to the formula the Hilary Duff vehicle draws effectively on her musical talent and popular appeal. Whereas Duffs Lizzie McGuire persona catered to the female ""tween"" demographic new pic whose themes include young love and the somber topic of death is meant to woo a slightly older audience and position Duff for more mature roles. Item which falls well short of a ""Fame"" for the new millennium should perform solidly if perhaps not spectacularly at the B.O. Duffs Terri Fletcher hails from a long line of youths for whom creative expression yields both self-realization and escape from an overprotective or domineering parent figure (Jennifer Grey in ""Dirty Dancing"" Kevin Bacon in ""Footloose"" etc.). Gifted singer Terri longs to attend a performing arts summer school in Los Angeles but her father Simon (David Keith) insists L.A. is no place for a 16-year-old girl from Flagstaff. Terris supportive brother Paul (Jason Ritter) however tells her if she doesnt pursue her goals now shell find herself ""doing Cats at the Y at 40."" Without Terris knowledge Paul has compiled video footage of her performing and sent it to the arts school to buttress her application. Minutes into the film tragedy strikes when Paul -- possibly the most agreeable sibling in movie history -- dies in a car accident. The films subsequent repeated use of Pauls death as a narrative axis however feels manipulative and contrived. Terri abandons her musical dreams after Paul dies but when an acceptance letter from the Bristol-Hilliman Conservatory arrives Terris free-spirited Aunt Nina (Rebecca DeMornay) and mother Frances (Rita Wilson) insist the summer program would do her good. Telling father Simon that Terri is off to visit Aunt Nina in Palm Desert mother Frances puts her on a train with a cell phone and a hug. Terri arrives in L.A. and in contrast to her hometowns bucolic charm Los Angeles couldnt seem more like Sodom and Gomorra. Sleazy streetwalkers and congested intersections supplant green lawns and backyard barbecues; hard-edged rock replaces soft piano chords on the soundtrack. The contrast is so stark it feels like a cheap shot but it makes the point Terris not in Kansas -- er Arizona -- anymore. Upon her arrival at Bristol-Hilliman Terri meets the students destined to become her friends and rivals Jay (Oliver James) the cute boy with the British accent; Robin (Lauren C. Mayhew) the haughty vixen he once dated; Denise (Dana Davis) the seriously talented African-American violin-playing roommate; and Sloane (Kat Dennings) the Goth pianist whos caught the eye of budding percussionist Kiwi (Johnny Lewis). Several characters fall into facile archetypes including faculty members principally John Corbetts sympathetic Mr. Torvald and Robert Trebors stern Mr. Wesson. And it should come as no surprise that the term ends with a performance contest in which contestants vie for a scholarship. Plot points are predictable Love blossoms between Terri and Jay but Robin poses a threat; Terri must regain her self-confidence and love of singing following her brothers death; dad Simon discovers the ruse and arrives at the conservatory minutes before the final performance to demand Terris prompt return home. But this is a teen empowerment fantasy and before you can say ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner"" Terri has found her voice and the courage to stand up to her dad. Altogether ""Raise Your Voice"" is pretty innocuous stuff. Its nowhere near as exhilarating as ""Fame"" or even ""Flashdance"" and Terris performance skills are less awe-inspiring than the plot requires. Much more impressive are the musical abilities of Davis who does things with an acoustic violin few have ever seen or heard. Duff makes an engaging heroine but her immaculately coifed blonde locks and undiminished lip gloss (worn even while sleeping)remind viewers just how much of a star vehicle this actually is. Perhaps had it truly been an ensemble piece ""Raise Your Voice"" might have raised the bar. Tech elements are uniformly solid.

Consider Mandy Moore whose virginal eagerness is lit by a spark of inquiring delight; shes clean without being squeaky. Hilary Duff on the other hand with her blond Barbie bangs sugary princess voice and coyly batting daddys-girl eyelashes is like a product of the Britney/Olsens teenbot assembly line and so the scrubbed earnestness she displays in a movie like Raise Your Voice seems less a personality than a plea for attention. Shes as emotionally dynamic as an Oreo cookie -- a programmed flirt on the outside whos all sweetness and light on the inside. She makes me long for the comparatively Dostoyevskian depths of Sandra Dee. In Raise Your Voice a tween update of Fame Duff plays a small-town girl with big pipes and bigger dreams who sets off for Los Angeles to attend the highly competitive three-week summer music program at the Bristol-Hillman Conservatory. Looking half as tall as everyone else in the movie (John Corbett especially towers over her as a saintly hippie vocal instructor) Duff is the breathy soft-pop angel in a pool of precocious exhibitionists. Theres the hip-hop drum-machine geek the pianist who broods like Morticia Addams the mean-enough- to-be-head-cheerleader choral tart and the spiky-haired lyricist (Oliver James) who becomes her collaborator in love. The cheesy unctuousness of Fame is that it passed off high school soap opera as artistic torment. I enjoyed the musical numbers in Raise Your Voice including Duffs but the rest of the film is too synthetic to even be called cheese.
