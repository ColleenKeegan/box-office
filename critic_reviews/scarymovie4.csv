This time Saw and The Grudge are the main two horrors referenced otherwise its thrillers (War of the Worlds) dramas (Brokeback Mountain) and even chat shows (Oprah). Anna Faris reprises her role as Cindy now a Kate Hudson-type figure whos haunted by a small boy whose village-dwelling father (Bill Pullman) holds the key to the recent alien invasion. It edges closest to successful comedy with its characters. Otherwise the humours base and at its happiest when racist homophobic and scatological (preferably all at the same time). Watch (sober) at your peril.

"Scary Movie 4 Parody Till They Drop washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Correction to This Article An April 14 Style review misidentified the director of ""Scary Movie 4."" The director is David Zucker not Jerry Zucker his brother who is also a writer-producer-director. Movies Scary Movie 4 Parody Till They Drop A not-so-tidy bowl Anna Faris spoofs ""Saw"" in a scene from ""Scary Movie 4."" The movie also sends up ""The Grudge"" ""War of the Worlds"" and more. (Marni Grossman - The Weinstein Company) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 14 2006 Please dont tell anyone but I kind of liked ""Scary Movie 4."" Youre not supposed to like sequels unless they are ""Godfather"" sequels and then you can like only one. But to like a No. 4? Good Lord is the man insane or courageous beyond description? Since I have described myself as ""courageous beyond description"" many times it surely must be the latter. And the movie may be a No. 4 in official sequence but its actually a No. 2 in pedigree. That is because the first two films of the franchise were Wayans productions the genius-family -- Keenen Ivory Shawn and Marlon -- that created ""In Living Color"" and unleashed Jennifer Lopez on the world. But by No. 3 the Wayans DNA had vanished and the direction moved to Jerry Zucker co-co-creator of such laugh-dense nutfests as ""Airplane"" and ""Naked Guns 1 2 1/2 and 3."" So ""Scary Movie 4"" is a Zucker thing with nary a Wayans in sight. The Zucker formula is somewhat more free-form than the Wayans way. The Wayans films sent up and closely followed the teen slasher formula a gaggle of comely adolescents in a deserted location being hunted down and extinguished one by one by a madman. The fast die first the kids always split up the car wont start and finally only the virgin remains. Zucker and his writer Craig Mazin (Jim Abrahams a longtime Zucker collaborator pitched in) go nuttier; they dont limit themselves to one genre but basically rumble and bumble all over the place primarily targeting four films but dipping into this or that when it amuses them. Or it doesnt even have to be movies One plot strand plays with the image of a slightly challenged American president dealing with a national security crisis while listening to a childrens book about a duck being read to second-graders. His aides have trouble pulling him away ""I want to see how it ends"" he says. The main targets are Steven Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" Takashi Shimizus ""The Grudge"" Ang Lees ""Brokeback Mountain"" James Wans ""Saw"" and M. Night Shyamalans ""The Village."" (The films lowest moment is a pointless humorless sendup of ""Million Dollar Baby."") Combining such disparate story lines of course leads to much unavoidable stupidity. What is the suburban Tokyo haunted house of ""The Grudge"" doing next to the Bayonne N.J. dockworkers house of ""War of the Worlds"" and why when people are sucked into the invading alien pod machines of ""War"" do they find themselves in the scummy bathroom of ""Saw""? On the other hand if anyone strenuously objects to these on logical grounds maybe that person needs a drink a life and a nap. The film opens with what may be its best gag or maybe its just that I enjoyed watching Dr. Phil saw his own leg off a little too much. Dr. Phil and Shaquille ONeal (together at last) find themselves chained together in that scuzzy mens room. In order to free themselves Shaq has to hit a free throw Now when I write it it just lies there on the page like a description of sodium turning to black goo when heated in a Bunsen burner flame but its very funny on-screen. Thats from ""Saw."" Soon were switching back and forth between a parody of ""The Grudge"" in which longtime ""Scary Movie"" vet Anna Faris is trying to take care of Cloris Leachman while a little boy in mascara keeps popping out of the woodwork and a parody of ""War of the Worlds"" set next door in dockworker Craig Bierkos house where alien pod-machines are destroying New Jersey. I cant really remember how ""The Village"" came into it but soon enough Faris and another ""Scary"" vet Regina Hall have wandered into a 19th-century village that must be just off the New Jersey Turnpike where Bill Pullman is doing quite an amusing turn in the William Hurt role and Chris Elliott is drooling away as Adrien Brody. ""Scary Movie 4"" never takes you close to death by laughter as the ""Naked Gun"" films did that zone of oxygen deprivation where your life flashes before your eyes and turns out to be so boring you almost pass out. But its funny enough to turn the hands on your watch much more quickly than you can believe. Scary Movie 4 (83 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for gross humor sexual innuendo and comic violence.

The even numbers dont favor the ""Scary Movie"" franchise. Inspiration ran dry for the Wayans Brothers in No. 2; now successors David Zucker amp; Co suffer gag fatigue following up their moderately improving efforts on the third installment. ""Scary Movie 4"" finds horror parody overshadowed by ho-hum groin blows C-list celebrity cameos slapstick child abuse soon-to-be-forgotten hip-hop personalities plus scatalogical and gay jokes; real laughs are few. Nonetheless hardtop and ancillary coinage should be robust with the horror genres continued high popularity clinching pics pre-sold lowbrow appeal. After briefly getting Dr. Phil and Shaquille ONeal into ""Saw Is"" central predicament then bringing back Charlie Sheen from ""Scary 3"" for a Viagra-impaired suicide series star Anna Faris as dumb blonde Cindy Campbell gets a job as nursemaid to an infirm elderly woman (Cloris Leachman). Latters house is haunted by a malevolent ghost child a la ""The Grudge."" But before she can dig too deeply into that mystery Cindy gets distracted by the handsome neighbor next door divorced and negligent working-class dad Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko). Then aliens attack and Tom flees with the kids hes semi-estranged from a la ""War of the Worlds."" Cindy too gets the hell outta town picking up fellow series regular Regina Hall as randy Brenda Meeks (despite the fact shes been killed in each prior ""Scary""). They end up in a time-warped village like ""The Village"" with Bill Pullman as William Hurt Carmen Electra as Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Elliott as Adrien Brody. Others who get more than a single scene include Leslie Nielsen as an idiot President and Michael Madsen as Tim Robbins ""War"" nutcase. James Earl Jones narrates. Theres not a lot of satire left in these films. Most of the jokes are just references to other movies or rote ow-my-head slapstick violence or a combination of both. Rarely is much fun had with genre conventions -- as if that might be too sophisticated for an audience that finds humor enough in simply being reminded of the movies watched and songs heard since ""Scary Movie 3."" With so much depending on disposable pop-culture touchstones the question is whether such features will have any entertainment value left when for example the word ""Chingy"" once again signifies ... nothing. Minus the closing credit crawl and an epilogue sending up Tom Cruises Katie-lovin wigout on ""Oprah"" ""4"" would scarcely nudge 75 minutes. Which is still about 70 minutes longer than it warrants. If Faris and Halls comic chops are barely exercised here time is still on their side; one hopes someday theyll get the stellar lead roles they deserve. Still it must be said that the production package is loud pacey and colorful enough -- decent CGI FX included -- that a whole lotta not-much goes by with painless speed.

Starring Anna Faris Regina Hall Craig Bierko and Carmen Electra. Directed by David Zucker. (PG-13 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Airplane"" co-director David Zucker is like your grandfather who still refuses to buy a computer typing out letters to the editor on an old Corona long after the rest of the world discovered e-mail. Zucker satirizes movies that came out a year and a half ago and pop culture events from even further back -- which have long since been lampooned to exhaustion in ""South Park"" episodes entertainment blogs and other new media. And yet somehow Zuckers ""Scary Movie 4"" is a success mixing in more than enough well-earned laughs with the repetitive slapstick flatulence and Mike Tyson ear-biting jokes. ""Scary Movie 4"" isnt a comedy classic but its still about five times as funny as ""Scary Movie 3."" Its sort of stupid to try to explain the plot since there really isnt one. ""SM4"" spends about 25 percent of the time spoofing ""War of the Worlds"" 25 percent on ""The Grudge"" 18 percent on ""The Village"" and 12 percent on the ""Saw"" movies -- with the remaining 20 percent split between Tom Cruises ""Oprah"" appearance ""Brokeback Mountain"" and three or four movies I must not have seen. Zucker in his late 50s now proves that he hasnt learned many new tricks still shooting his film like a cross between a Mel Brooks movie and ""Crash"" -- with all of the silly subplots coincidentally crisscrossing each other throughout. But with the rapid-fire humor approach that Zucker his brother Jerry and Jim Abrahams practically invented the joke only needs a modest hit-to-miss ratio to be successful approximately equivalent to a good three-point percentage in basketball. Maybe 38 percent of the comedy hits its mark in this movie and thats more than enough to satisfy. While ""SM4"" is much better than its predecessor its not like the writers suddenly found religion. This movie is still packed with gratuitous scantily clad women diarrhea jokes and mindless slapstick -- at one point all in the same scene. But for unknown reason (maybe its all this rain) the stunts just seem funnier this time. Anna Faris returns and excels in her deadpan role and is joined by the excellent Craig Bierko a poor mans Brendan Fraser who was last seen as Max Baer in ""Cinderella Man."" Or perhaps the good luck comes from the presence of Leslie Nielsen who must be about 112 now yet still musters his funniest performance since the early 1990s. The trademark cameos also score big in ""SM4"" -- especially a ""Saw"" spoof involving Shaquille ONeal and Dr. Phil McGraw who take turns seeing who can make more good-natured fun of themselves. ""Im not even a psychologist"" Dr. Phil goofs. ""Im an electrician."" This is one of those movies where we wish there was a rating between the Little Man sitting and Little Man clapping. (Little Man leaning forward intently? Little Man delivering polite golf clap?) Shaqs missed free-throw jokes put it over the edge. -- Advisory This film contains profanity strong sexual innuendos and comic violence. Also Leslie Nielsen appears in the movie almost totally naked which makes the Kathy Bates hot tub scene in ""About Schmidt"" seem like Phoebe Cates in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" by comparison.

"Scary Movie 4 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scary-movie-4 ) Scary Movie 4 (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Scary Movie 4 is better than Scary Movie 3. Writing that sentence falls into the category of damning with faint praise because the experience of sitting through the third installment of the comedy series was as pleasant as spreading organic fertilizer on the hottest day of the summer. The sense of desperation that pervaded Scary Movie 3 is gone and there are enough laughs in Scary Movie 4 to keep most viewers distracted for a majority of its skinny 80-minute running time. But to go with the good theres plenty of bad and it comes in the form of countless gags that misfire far too much flatulence and urine and (God help us) a buck naked Leslie Nielsen. Admittedly that scene certainly puts the ""scary"" in Scary Movie 4. Plot is irrelevant to this film so its not worth talking about what passes for one. Scary Movie 4 is a cobbled together parody of four generally accessible movies Saw War of the Worlds The Grudge and The Village. Along the way there are digs at other movies like Fahrenheit 9/11 (although one could question whether this is a swipe at the film or at the President) and Brokeback Mountain. The way in which these storylines are interwoven makes no sense but it doesnt have to. The production team features David Zucker and Jim Abrahams two of the three members of ZAZ (Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker) the trio responsible for Airplane and The Naked Gun and their goal is to find a familiar looking backdrop for a clothesline of spoofs and jokes. This ""saturation style"" of comedy doesnt work as well as it has in the past because the ratio of failed jokes to successful ones is too high. Its not exactly work to sit through Scary Movie 4 but there are times when it comes close. Returning for the fourth episode is Anna Faris who once again plays the irrepressible Cindy Campbell. Faris is either a good sport or desperately in need of work. Speaking of good sports theres 80-year old Leslie Nielsen who plays a dim version of George W. Bush. For the first time in his career Nielsen does a nude scene - or does he? It could easily be a stunt double but it really doesnt matter. The scene is kind of funny in an ""eeww"" sort of way. And its not as if Nielsen could embarrass himself any more than he did in Scary Movie 3. The other lead is Craig Bierko who does his best Tom Cruise impersonation - and yes that includes jumping around on a faux Oprahs couch before getting into a fist fight with her. There are plenty of cameos but all are of the low-rent sort. Shaquille ONeal and Dr. Phil appear in the opening scene playing out a scenario from Saw. Charlie Sheen reprises his role from Scary Movie 3. Hefs three girlfriends play a game of Scrabble. (Why in the world would anyone be interested in watching these three play a board game? I can think of much more interesting things to watch them do.) Michael Madsen does what he does best - look mean. Mike Tyson dresses in drag and bites a few ears. And Bill Pullman shows up under a thick beard - apparently hoping he can pick up a paycheck without anyone recognizing him. What more is there to say about Scary Movie 4? Its a far cry from the hilarious edgy antics of Scary Movie but it has about as much going for it as the first sequel. Its a cash cow for its distributors (Dimension and Miramax) and doesnt have to make much at the box office to be a bona fide success. The quality is strictly direct-to-video but that wont stop kids from flocking to see it. (The series received a ratings downgrade from R to PG-13 with Scary Movie 3.) Its okay for a few cheap laughs but better suited for late-night cable viewing than even a matinee ticket purchase. If you decide to sit this one out never fear - I am reasonably certain there will soon be a Scary Movie 5. There are some things that wont die and this series is one of them.

Four installments later the horror-movie jokes have gotten broader grosser and just plain dumber. Boffo box-office returns however have kept the Scary Movie monster alive. Discerning movie goers however might have other ideas. Scary Movie 4 is an unruly unmitigated mess. Instead of concentrating on lampooning one specific movie -- or even one genre -- writer Craig Mazin and director David Zucker jump all over the movie map. In under 90 minutes attacks are plotted and carried out against Tom Cruises kooky Oprah appearance as well as films The Grudge War of the Worlds Brokeback Mountain The Village and strangely Million Dollar Baby. None land with any particular punch. Scary Movie 4 opens with what seems like a promising takeoff on ghastly slasher flick Saw pairing Shaquille ONeal and Dr. Phil as prisoners in a dank torture chamber. What it amounts to however is an easy shot against Kobe Bryant and a bad-acting duel with ONeal coming out the winner (or loser). Much of Scary Movie 4 thrives on cheap thrills several involving injury to children and animals. Even spoof vet Leslie Nielsen is wasted as the bumbling U.S. president in material that could have been sharpened into satire. His big payoff? A gross-out nude scene involving shocked United Nations delegates. Anna Faris returns as former reporter turned caretaker Cindy Campbell. Shes prone to breathy dialogue and taking objects to the head. This time Campbell is investigating the murder of a Japanese child while nurturing a romance with Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko) amid inevitable world destruction by a giant iPod. (Dont ask.) Since her Scary Movie debut in 2000 Faris has proved herself an appealing competent actress with a recurring spot on Friends final season and pivotal roles in Brokeback Mountain and Lost in Translation. Shes a puzzle here sleepwalking through most of her scenes. Scary Movie 4s few successful moments come courtesy of franchise regular Regina Hall who returns as Brenda Meeks fabulous girlfriend to Faris dour leading lady. Hall brings some edgy humor thats sorely lacking from the rest of the film.

"Scary Movie 4 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Scary Movie 4 reviewed. Scary Movie 4 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 13 2006 644 PM And Dont Call Me Funny David Zuckers Scary Movie 4 is all spoofed out. By Ben Wasserstein ""Tom"" jumps on ""Oprahs"" couch in Scary Movie 4 Scary Movie 4 (Dimension) begins with Shaquille ONeal coming to in a dingy room his leg trapped in a vise a la Saw. He sits up--and bonks his head on a pipe. Then he stands up--and bonks his head on the ceiling. If that description made you spit your coffee all over your keyboard then run to the nearest theater and you might want to pass on the soda. But if it sounded a little stale the type of thing youd seen before--maybe in Scary Movie 3 when Charlie Sheens character was also introduced waking up with a series of head bonks--then the latest spoof from director David Zucker isnt worth the 83 minutes or the dozen or so head bonks. And if you think that spit-take reference was hokey stay far away indeed No gags are too hoary for this movie. The Scary Moviesare a curious Mobius strip of a franchise. Scary Movie was the writer Kevin Williamsons title for the script that became Scream (1996). Bob Weinsteins Dimension Films owned the rights to the original title and the first Scary Movie (2000) directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans was a hard-R gross-out comedy smash spoofing Scream (itself a knowing self-referential satire). But Wayans wan R-rated haunted-house Scary Movie 2 (2001) underperformed and the studio turned to Airplane (1980) and Naked Gun helmer David Zucker to give the franchise broader PG-13 appeal. Zucker delivered the series biggest opening-weekend take; Scary Movie is now improbably the Weinstein brothers biggest commercial franchise. Advertisement Not surprisingly the fourth installment is a total retread of its predecessor. Once again the plots styles and wardrobes of a few horror hits--this time its mostly War of the Worlds The Grudge The Village and the Saw movies--are uneasily shoehorned into the cinematic Cuisinart. And once more the main characters arent satires of those movies--theyre the usual gang of idiots Anna Faris admirably vacant-eyed Cindy; Regina Hall whose horndog Brendas gruesome demise in Scary Movie 3 is sunnily dismissed; and new addition Craig Bierko playing the Tom-Cruise-in-War-of-the-Worlds part. The leather jacket and first name (Tom) are gimmes but the characters just another oblivious stiff. Cruises self-doubting blue-collar hero shtick would be ripe for satire but the movie would rather let their Tom bang his head and make stinky in his pants. ""Why dont any of us have dryers?"" asks one bystander as the alien tripods land a nice jab at Steven Spielbergs clothesline-saturatedvision of working-class New Jersey but such critiques are few and far between. Jokes from Scary Movie 3 are recycled ad nauseam Instead of the little boy from The Ring as a neglected punching bag its the Dakota Fanning character in War of the Worlds. Anthony Anderson again engages in a drawn-out misguided fight. There are more cameos from just-behind-the-curve rappers (this time its YoungbloodZ Chingy Lil Jon and Fabolous). Carmen Electra strips down to her Pussycat Dolls outfit for no reason at all--I mean shes the blind girl from The Village. This stuff wasnt funny the first time and it wilts on-screen the second. Leslie Nielsens reprise as the imbecilic president is the rare bit of recycling that works though a shirtless scene is a brutal reminder of how long its been since Lt. Frank Drebin threw clay with Jane in Naked Gun 2 1/2. Whats worse Zucker continues his tendency to let scenes escalate into mindless shouting as though that fulfills the promise of a punch line. It happensin the faux-Saw opening with Shaq (failing to live up to Kareem Abdul-Jabbars proud straight-man legacy from Airplane) and Dr. Phil and in the oddly timeworn bit about unlocking a car door. In a movie so scrupulously up-to-date (a not-bad Brokeback parody a reference to MySpace) how did that stay in? Thats not to say that there arent any laughs. Bill Pullman (as Bill Pullman in The Grudge kinda and William Hurt/Joaquin Phoenix in The Village) andMichael Madsen (Tim Robbins War of the Worlds kook) prove the wisdom of the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker theory of casting dramatic actors in spoofs. A conversation in subtitled Japanese--""Hari kari tsunami kamikaze bansai""--is inspired. But the heart of the movies problems is its lack of heart. As Robert K. Weiss a longtime ZAZ collaborator and the producer of Scary Movie 4 once said ""You have to have something invested in these characters otherwise its just a jokebook."" Airplane Top Secret The Naked Gun--they were movies not an accumulation of sketches. In Scary Movie 4 the romance between Tom and Cindy has its deadpan highs Cindy ""Were already finishing each others--""Tom ""--dinner.""Cindy ""--sentences."" But that kind of worthy silliness comes in dribs and drabs and then the two spend most of the film working through the plots of their respective parodies. They engage in long closed-mouth kisses which must be a joke of some kind--everything is--but only underline the love storys phoniness. After all why worry about characters when there are more movie references to jam in? That may be the biggest horror of all The Scary Movie 4 filmmakers were scared to make a movie.

That way not only would more artistes get to play in the game (Ive got a hankering to see what Baz Luhrmann would do with the form in full Moulin Rouge twirl) but audiences would be spared the diminishing returns bred of overfamiliarity with a genre thats hit-or-miss to begin with. (One mans Chris Elliott-as-Village-idiot snot joke is another womans look-at-the-wristwatch moment.) All this is my way of saying that just as the Wayans brothers Scary Movie 2 was a duller model than their original Scary Movie so David Zuckers Scary Movie 4 offers nothing we didnt see in his Scary Movie 3 -- except perhaps the uncomfortable sight of Dr. Phil trying to mock the unbearable lightness of being Dr. Phil while Shaquille ONeal peddles his Shaq-ness. The plot (what plot?) solves the mystery of a haunted house a ghost boy and an alien invasion stumbling goofily from punchline to punchline; the Brokeback Mountain joke with two black cowboys (Anthony Anderson and Kevin Hart) defending their heterosexuality while reaching for lubricants was tired four months ago. I bow to reliably funny franchise princesses Anna Faris as resilient heroine Cindy Campbell and Regina Hall as Cindys horny pal Brenda. (Faris a Brokeback cast member for real now gamely bathes Cloris Leachman with a bucket of fake urine in the name of hilarity.) But I wonder when the pair might want to relinquish their whoopee-cushioned thrones. (Craig Bierko plays War of the Worlds Tom Ryan playing Faris next-door neighbor and boyfriend. And a fine crazyperson he makes bouncing on Oprahs furniture with Cruisey mania too.) As ever the criteria for mockworthiness have less to do with the scariness of the source material (or for that matter the precision of the joke bombs) than a certain self-seriousness expressed in an easily identifiable production design thats ripe for loving cannibalization. Zucker and his crew (including scripters Craig Mazin and Jim Abrahams) have fun with the working-class housing in War of the Worlds (and Dakota Fannings gumdrop- colored wardrobe) the dour landscape in The Village and the accursed little stool that signals tragedy in the ring in Million Dollar Baby. They just dont have much to say about the movies they mock. And as ever the jokes are a jumble of the gross the baggy the raunchy the mistimed and -- every once in a while -- the refreshingly incorrect. The scariest moment in Scary Movie 4 involves Zucker veteran Leslie Nielsen playing his patented bumbling President Harris While the U.S. is under attack this yutz sits in a chair at an elementary school raptly listening to a kid read a book about a pet animal.
