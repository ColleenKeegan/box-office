Like the omnipresent tentacles of East Germanys onetime secret police ""The Lives of Others"" grips like a boa constrictor. Superbly cast drama centered on a loyal Stasi officer and a writer he spies on just prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall is a socko feature debut by scripter-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck that looks to be a solid upscale attraction wherever the special chemistry of good writing and performances is appreciated. Inexplicably absent from the lineups of both the Berlin and Cannes festivals this year pic deserves major fest slots prior to specialized theatrical and tube play. Since its mid-March local release the movie has hunted down more than 11 million in 11 weeks and been showered with kudos -- four at the Bavarian Film Awards and seven at the national German Film Awards (Lolas). Latter included best film director actor (Ulrich Muehe) and screenplay. Though the pic lacks the marketable Hitler hook of ""Downfall"" and is not based on a real-life event it looks set to benefit from growing offshore awareness of well-crafted German dramas inspired by recent history. In tone and the way the drama is allowed to grow from the coolly objective helming ""Lives of Others"" is closer to last years ""Sophie Scholl The Final Days"" and has an equally powerful finish. The time is 1984 the place East Berlin and per an opening title ""glasnost is nowhere in sight."" The population of East Germany is controlled by the Stasis 100000 employees and 200000 informers whose goal is to know everything about the lives of others. Among the most devoted of the Stasis officers is Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Muehe all hollow-eyed expressionless stare) who can smell a dissident at a thousand paces and has no life beyond his work. At a performance of the latest play by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) -- ""our only non-subversive writer whos read in the West"" -- he decides almost as a personal challenge to investigate the playwright whom Wiesler cant believe is as clean as he seems. Supported by a longtime colleague Lt.-Col. Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur radiating ruthless bonhomie) head of the Cultural Dept. and former Stasi officer-turned-minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme channeling the late Gerd Froebe) Wiesler has Dreymans apartment wired. But Wiesler cant pin anything on the scribe who genuinely believes in East Germanys socialist ideals. Rather the pics dramatic motor is Wiesler becoming fascinated by Dreymans life and his live-in relationship with actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). When Hempf whos taken a liking to Christa-Maria orders Wiesler to pin something on Dreyman to get him out of the way the loyal Stasi acolyte finds himself in a quandary for the first time in his career. Meantime Dreyman also has his beliefs shaken by the suicide of an old friend stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert). Complex script balances the many dramatic and emotional strands between the players with poise and clarity. Though the film is talky small-scale and has almost no physical action it grips from the opening frame simply through the power of the performances and the way in which it doesnt stray down the usual political-thriller paths with simple stereotypes. When Wiesler turns from an observer of peoples lives to a manipulator and participant and is caught like a rat in his own trap he becomes as fleet-footed as any dissident. Final two reels take the story beyond the fall of the Wall into the early 90s. Though thats initially jolting -- just when the pic appears to have finished -- the dramatic gamble does pay off tying up some loose plot-ends in a simple but emotionally powerful conclusion that makes the story resonate into present-day Germans lives. Top-billed Gedeck is fine as the actress torn between her career and personal emotions but the movie is Muehes an East German-born legit thesp known for his roles in Michael Haneke films and as Dr. Mengele in Costa-Gavras ""Amen."" Communicating much through the smallest actions Muehe is especially good opposite Tukur as his wily superior. Scripts strain of black comedy -- best seen in a commissary scene where a Stasi staffer unwisely cracks a joke about East German leader Erich Honecker -- is beautifully played by the two vets. Widescreen tech package is clean and tight with art director Silke Buhr and d.p. Hagen Bogdanski creating a slightly stylized look by playing up grays and dour greens even when using actual locations like the Stasis onetime HQ in Normannenstrasse. Period detail looks just right; Gabriel Yareds symphonic score adds atmosphere and tension. The Lives of OthersGermany ProductionA Buena Vista Intl.

Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who meets an insecure actress (Martina Gedeck) in The Lives of Others. Photo Buena Vista The Lives of Others 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Cinema goers are natural spies. No matter what the genre movies provide a chance for sanctioned eavesdropping -- that verboten thrill of dropping in one someone elses tragedy someone elses joy. Films about spying offer one more layer of surveillance We snoop on the snoops. The French film Cache spun an entire (if slow-pulse) thriller from this meta-movie gambit but even an entry in the more-conventional gumshoe genre -- The Good Shepherd or Breach -- invites us to peek through the keyhole at folks who normally do the peeking. How rare though is a film like The Lives of Others which brings acumen and compassion to the study of an East German agent. The act of spying which dehumanizes the watcher and distances the watched becomes an act of intimacy. The Stasi agent observes his subject then feels for him With gradual but unstoppable force he enters his life. Repercussions both tragic and redemptive unfold. Written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature debut The Lives of Others won the Academy Award for best foreign-language film earlier this week -- beating Pans Labyrinth the Guillermo del Toro fable laden with tearjerking sentiment and eye-popping effects. Von Donnersmarcks film yields some saline at the end but its visual effects are limited to Ulrich Muhes eyebrows. At first sight -- plus the second and probably the third -- Muhes face and carriage have the hard-line torpor of a government drone whose humanity has cured into concrete. His character Stasi agent Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler toes the company line in the classroom where he lectures young Kommunisten in the fine art of interrogating ""enemies of socialism"" and at work where he displays his technique. In his first scene we see him torturing a suspect with sleep deprivation This is not some warm and fuzzy guy. When Wiesler is assigned to monitor the comings goings love-makings party-happenings and utter existence of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) he sets to the job with his usual East Bloc assiduity. Dreymans flat is wired stem to stern and several scenes boast the familiar asymmetrical rhythms -- standard in espionage movies -- of life being lived in one room and observed in another. Snug in his headphones hunched in a Stasi rat hole Wiesler types up bone-dry paraphrases of Dreymans conversations with his blacklisted friend (Volkmar Kleinert ) and his glamorous but insecure actress-girlfriend (Martina Gedeck). Then two events unfold Wiesler gets unsavory news about a boss motivation in the Dreyman case and Muhes eyebrows work their magic. They creep up toward his pate. They hang quizzically. They pitch a tent over his eyes announcing ennui and dismay and disgust and engagement and something that begins after a time to resemble compassion. Once his eyebrows start moving his actions follow throwing this pathological compacted loner into the human fray. I fear giving away too much of von Donnersmarcks plot as its suspense builds on the fragile and nuanced business of emotional rebirth. With a lesser cast less patiently directed it might not have worked. But Muhes quiet transformation Kochs facile charm Gedecks neediness Kleinerts bitter resignation and the lumpen-thug charisma of Thomas Thieme (as a corrupt Stasi minister) all lift this sincere straightforward film into a persuasive story of moral and political redemption. ""If you dont take a stand youre not human"" says Kleinerts character trying to rouse Dreyman from complacency. Wiesler wakes up too turning The Lives of Others into the tale of the Good East German. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GoPlus Racing Style Executive Chair for 80 + free shipping Open-Box Unlocked Galaxy S7 4G Android Phone for 420 + free...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Lives"" is a humane political thriller|The numbers were daunting. They remain haunting. During the period in which the Oscar-nominated ""The Lives of Others"" is set the East German secret police - the Stasi- had 100000 employees and 200000 informants. Such is the toxic atmosphere of paranoia and vulnerable relationships infusing writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarks powerful subtly moving debut. Georg Dreyman is a well-respected playwright living in East Berlin. His lover Christa-Maria Sieland is an equally admired actress. The year is 1984 the Walls crumbling five years away. Played with subtle masculine appeal by Sebastian Koch Georg continues to flourish in the German Democratic Republic even as friends and colleagues find it increasingly oppressive repressive or worse. After a performance of his latest play Georg broaches the subject of a friend and former directors ""blacklisting"" with a party minister. A man of great decency Georg believes hes made progress pressing Albert Jerskas case. Hes mistaken. Moments earlier Minister Hempf OKd the aggressive surveillance of Georgs apartment. The smarmy bureaucrat has taken a shine to Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Laid out this way you might think that this is Georgs story alone. In this beautifully executed philosophical-political thriller the artists tale is inextricably bound to Capt. Gerd Wiesler a Stasi true believer. Weve already seen the captain in chilling action as he teaches a course in interrogation. And Wiesler has shared his suspicions about Dreyman with former classmate Grubitz (Ulrich Tukar) now the head of the Stasis culture department. Too clean to be true Wiesler says. Wiretaps microphones cameras are put in place while Georg visits Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert). ""What is a director if he cant direct?"" asks Georgs fallen friend. He answers his own question bleakly. Arts power to confer an identity on its practitioners is a persuasive theme here. Christa-Maria is vulnerable to Hempfs sexual advances not merely because she doubts her talent but because Hempf really can take away her calling. At his 40th-birthday party Jerska gives Georg a piece of music. ""Sonata for a Good Man"" composed by Gabriel Yared for the movie sets a mournful telling mood. A strange thing happens as the gifted eavesdropper Wiesler listens and watches. Disenchantment with corruption nudges him toward surprising actions. With their technologically enhanced sense of omnipotence the Stasi and the party have a power not unlike that of the Greeks meddling gods. Needless to say they engineer tragedy. Thomas Thieme convinces as Hempf. Hes so good you might sock him if you cross paths. The rest of the cast is as pitch perfect. Still it is Ulrich Muhes portrayal of Wiesler that makes the film such an impressively humane political thriller. The muted shifts in Wieslers character suggest that when you truly engage the lives of others you open yourself to profound change. It is a transformation that may cost the Stasi loyal. Von Donnersmark makes an elegant involving argument that no matter the price it will be right.

Starring Ulrich Muhe Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck. Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. (Rated R. 137 minutes. In German with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Before it reveals itself as a profound document before it even hints at its many degrees of thought and feeling ""The Lives of Others"" is already up and running as a tense political thriller. Set in the communist East Germany of just over 20 years ago it follows the Stasi -- the notorious espionage agency -- as it implements wall-to-wall surveillance on a successful playwright and his actress girlfriend. That angle is in itself unusual a thriller that follows the villains. Who are these people who populate the spy agency? Theyre the vindictive and small-minded the unimaginative and empty the cruel and the dull -- and every country has them. But only in tyrannies do they ever get to run things. These are people who see any sign of life as a rebuke of their own deadness. They see happiness as a pretense because they cant imagine it. They see it as a threat too because it implies a contented inner life some irreducible essence that cant be smudged by their foul hands. Thats why when Stasi Capt. Wiesler first sets eyes on playwright Georg Dreyman he doesnt like him. Dreyman by all accounts is a loyal socialist but the gaunt unsmiling captain sees the playwright -- handsome and self-possessed at home with himself as he watches his latest play -- and pronounces him ""arrogant."" Dreyman is a happy man -- an artist in love with his work and with another artist a great actress (Martina Gedeck) -- and that in itself makes him an enemy of the state. The rest is just a matter of details. At its core ""The Lives of Others"" is about the different ways people live. It shows right ways and wrong ways and then most compellingly it puts a man who has lived his life in a desperately wrong way -- as a tormenter of innocents as a government thug -- in the position of listening to the conversations and day-to-day interactions of a thoroughly decent man. This collision is compelling and it lifts an already suspenseful and fascinating story about life in East Germany onto a metaphysical universal plane. The result is a great film the best Ive seen since Terrence Malicks ""The New World"" and far and away the richest and most brilliantly acted picture to be released this Oscar season. Its nominated for best foreign film. There are three great performances in ""The Lives of Others"" each very different. As Dreyman Sebastian Koch has the challenge of presenting a man of innate humanity someone whose inner quality is apparent in his essential being despite a surface breeziness that could easily be seen as blithe. Koch seems to achieve the desired effect by having Dreyman lavish selfless attention on everyone with whom he comes into contact. Its in those interactions that we read the acute and sensitive understanding of a poet and a hero. For Ulrich Muhe as the captain the challenge is quite different. His surface note is repressed anger. Underneath that is resentment and fear. That means that anything meaningful that reaches him has to blast through layers of rock cemented by the mortar of ego. He is almost gone almost buried within himself but only almost. The facade is repugnant and never really changes but every so often theres a glint of something or someone underneath. At the center of these extremes theres Gedeck as Christa who has the misfortune of not being morally extraordinary. Recognized as the premier actress of the East German stage she is otherwise a normal person perhaps more sensitive and therefore a little weaker than most -- and therefore no match for the intrigues surrounding her. In any other country her life would be one of ease and glory. Instead she finds herself systematically trying to deaden herself to the terror and degradation that waits around every corner. As for the story it can wait until you see it. Better to talk about moments and meanings an ugly sexual interlude that says everything you need to know about the captains lonely private life. Or the scene in which Dreyman plays a requiem in memory of a friend -- a private moment of reflection and pain that the captain hears seemingly unmoved over his headphones. (The captain thinks that life is empty because hes empty but how does he stay unmoved when confronted day after day with evidence to the contrary?) And then theres Gedecks face at any point in the film full of feeling and full of the effort not to feel. Its haunting. The action takes place in 1984 just five years before the collapse of communism but an eternity away. ""The Lives of Others"" reminds us that for millions of people that happy ending came too late. -- Advisory Strong language nudity sexual situations.

Comments The Lives of Others Recommended Rated R  137 minutes I spent only an afternoon in East Germany before the Berlin Wall fell but the fearful silence in public places left a lingering impression. The reasons behind it are explored by writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his accomplished first feature about the Stasi the countrys secret police which had a staff of over 90000 plus countless informers and spied on friend and foe alike. The fictional story here set between 1984 and 1991 focuses on the investigation of a popular and patriotic playwright (Sebastian Koch); that the captain assigned to his case (touchingly played by Ulrich Muhe) is mainly sympathetic and working surreptitiously on the playwrights behalf only makes this more disturbing. With Martina Gedeck (Mostly Martha). In German with subtitles.

"In a police state a haunting tale of voyeurism - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In a police state a haunting tale of voyeurism By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 16 2007 ""The Lives of Others"" portrays the only kind of love story that can exist in a police state Paranoid one-sided voyeuristic. A movie of slowly accumulating tension and power Florian Henckel von Donnersmarcks drama -- a foreign language Oscar nominee with a good shot at winning -- is also a romance between two men but not the way you think.The fascination here is of the watcher for the watched of an East German surveillance expert for the worldly playwright under his microscope. ""The Lives of Others"" has similarities to Francis Ford Coppolas 1974 classic ""The Conversation"" but with undercurrents that resound across an entire century of European political history.The surveillance wonk is Gerd Weisler (Ulriche Muhe) a captain in the secret police ministry that generations of East Germans knew and feared as the Stasi. Hes not a rising star like his friend Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur). Rather Weislers the drab spook you never see -- the one who brings you to ruin. He knows the ins and outs of bugs and hidden cameras and he runs an interrogation like a poker game looking for the tell and always finding it.The time is the mid-1980s and the Soviet bloc is beginning to crack. Grubitz asks Weisler to open a surveillance file on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch from ""Gloomy Sunday"") a handsome playwright whos friendly to the regime but too intelligent to really be trusted. Weisler attends one of Georgs productions and lurking with binoculars spies his quarrys leading lady and lover Christa (Martina Gedeck). She embodies all the noise and color this invisible man has eliminated from his life. Hes hooked; he has to see how the play unfolds.""The Lives of Others"" evolves into an oddly entertaining split-level experience. In his East Berlin apartment Georg argues and has make-up sex with Christa meets with dissident friends and mulls whether to take a stand. His is the drama of the talented but cautious man and Koch who suggests a more sensitive Powers Boothe captures it with sympathy.In the attic above sharing shifts with a bored Stasi flunky and typing the least bit of humdrum into his reports is Weisler whos addicted like a housewife to her favorite soap. Pulled in by Christa hes held by Georg respecting first the man and then his dilemma. Always discreet he describes the couples lovemaking in clinical terms leaving out the passion. Soon he decides to omit other matters as well.""The Lives of Others"" thus wonders if doing nothing can represent as great a commitment as taking action -- if passivity can be political -- and it does so in the context of gripping prison-break suspense. The prison of course is daily life in the German Democratic Republic where no word or deed is innocent and where a collapsible typewriter smuggled in from the outside world is more dangerous than a bomb.Von Donnersmarck has made a film that spurns ""ostalgie"" the wry nostalgia for East Germany that fueled the light-hearted ""Good Bye Lenin"" This is a gray intolerable gulag of a society with artists and actors chewing their own limbs like trapped animals.The paranoia even has levels Grubitz harangues a young Stasi officer in the ministry cafeteria for telling an anti-Socialist joke then tells him hes kidding then implies that maybe hes not. The kids face turns green with uncertainty and we see him much later at a dead-end desk job. Even when youre safe here youre not.To survive in such an environment you have to cut deals and ""The Lives of Others"" is sharp about which deals constitute pragmatism and which constitute betrayal (of principles loved ones oneself; the choices are endless). Von Donnersmarck has cast the film well and he keeps things moving -- he favors solid storytelling over inspired filmmaking -- and he trusts that all will be held in place by the bald head and melting eyes of Weisler the vulture who has developed a conscience.If ""The Lives of Others"" has a flaw its that maybe vultures dont have consciences. In a performance of small precise movements Muhe creates a good soldier whose conversion doesnt quite ring true. Why after a life of fealty to the Socialist state does this unemotional cog start feeling? Theres a hole in the movies internal logic but its one most audiences and Academy members will be happy to overlook.The coda after the blood and the bricks have been cleaned up is as satisfying as anything in an old Hollywood romance. At the end of those movies the ugly ducking blooms the unwed mother is recognized by her grown child the secret lover is revealed. ""The Lives of Others"" offers something both more banal and more profound A police states unblinking eye finally seen and with it the shabby complicated little man at the other end of the camera.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

It was an ignorant notion as well as a malevolent one. Souls resist engineering and writers -- at least those worth getting excited about -- work best as soul-stirrers. Thats what the writer of this superlative political thriller turns out to be and wonder of wonders he has directed his own original script with all the flair and gravity it deserves. ENLARGE ""Political thriller"" hardly hints at the scope of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarcks debut feature -- in German with excellent English subtitles -- but youve got to start somewhere. (The filmmaker seems to have started at the top of his profession; his film nominated for an Oscar is as good as contemporary cinema gets.) First and foremost he has turned a bright light on a dark squalid domain of the former East Germany -- the Stasi or secret police whose declared goal was ""to know everything"" in that Communist nation of 17 million souls and whose 100000 employees working with as many as 200000 informants sustained a reign of pervasive terror from 1950 until 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell. Rather than dwell on the darkness and squalor however he has fashioned a genuinely thrilling tale leavened with sly humor that works ingenious variations on the theme of cat and mouse speaks to current concerns about personal privacy and illuminates the timeless conflict between totalitarianism and art. The story begins in East Berlin five years before the fall of the Wall when the Stasi puts a celebrated playwright under intense surveillance. Georg Dreyman is suspected of nothing in particular -- indeed he has long been considered politically reliable. Still a cultural commissar has his own reasons for targeting him so the full apparatus of official snoopery is brought to bear on the handsome relatively affluent writer and his equally prominent actress girlfriend Christa -- bugging his apartment tapping his phone listening to what he says day and night and transcribing his conversations in minute detail. (The excellent actors who play Georg and Christa Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are German celebrities in their own right.) The presiding snoop is a Stasi expert and true believer Captain Wiesler -- hes played with chilling brilliance by Ulrich Muhe. Wieslers stare is lethal. His small smile could curdle cream. His body is trim and his mind seems to have been trained for maximum suspicion with minimum introspection. Alone in his listening post head encased in earphones he monitors Dreyman and Christa with preternatural intensity. But then something strange starts to happen. The more deeply Wiesler enters the vibrant lives of those others the more his eavesdropping turns to empathy. I dont want to spoil the suspense -- or the austere fun -- by revealing the outcome. Suffice it to say that nothing can be taken for granted. But this unlikely hero is endlessly more interesting than he first seems to be and the remarkably supple script allows the spirit of Arthur Koestlers ""Darkness at Noon"" to co-exist with that of Woody Allens ""Bullets Over Broadway."" ENLARGE Martina Gedeck in The Lives of Others ""The Lives of Others"" is very much a filmmakers film with a rigorously controlled outwardly somber tone -- gray buildings stone faces baleful light a few shabby Trabis spewing tailpipe smoke on deserted streets. (The cinematographer was Hagen Bogdanski.) At the same time the drama is full of life and closely connected to life then and now. Its most obvious relevance to our world is its depiction of state-sanctioned surveillance (just as its most obvious movie reference is to Francis Coppolas masterful ""The Conversation""). We may see surveillance as a troubling necessity in a time of unprecedented danger while struggling to set its proper limits. The Stasi saw spying as a natural way of life and informers as a necessary good -- the human equivalent of pistachio shells used to pry other shells open. The films enduring value though lies in what it has to say -- never didactically always inferentially -- about the power of art the strength and fragility of artists (one scene in a cafe involving Christa and a hitherto secret admirer is as heartbreaking as it is breathtaking) and what it means to be human. Artists baffle the Stasi thugs and therefore frighten them. Wieslers superior a lubricious lieutenant colonel named Grubitz believes all artists can be reduced to five categories. The vast Stasi bureaucracy keeps track of every typewriter owned by every writer in the land the better to identify an author if subversive literature should surface. Grubitzs superior the porcine culture minister Hempf scorns the playwright Georg Dreyman with a special passion. ""Thats what we all love about your plays"" Hempf tells him condescendingly. ""Your love for humanity your belief that people can change. Dreyman no matter how often you say it in your plays people do not change."" But one person changes quite miraculously in ""The Lives of Others."" Its a life-changing movie. Breaking and Entering Anthony Minghellas ""Breaking and Entering"" starts busily and soon becomes a bafflement -- such an interesting cast such technical excellence so many intricate details and parallel plot threads yet so little clarity or urgency. ENLARGE Jude Law in Breaking and Entering Jude Law is a successful London architect Will Francis who lives not happily with a Swedish beauty named Liv; shes played by Robin Wright Penn. His design firm is in the process of transforming Kings Cross an area described by a cop perhaps charitably as being in flux. Soon after the firm puts down roots where its project is the flux materializes in the form of a gang of young thieves who break in at night and steal all the new computers. But the movies title covers more than material theft. Will whose long-term relationship is at the breaking point partly thanks to Livs emotionally disturbed daughter breaks into and enters the life of a beautiful Bosnian refugee Amira (Juliette Binoche working awfully hard in the role) whose child is also troubled. In her sons case its an existential anger that has led him to join the very gang that purloined the computers from Wills shop. This plot summary may sound silly but I didnt mean to use it as a tool of ridicule. The problem with discussing the film is the problem with watching the film. Its all over the place -- two dysfunctional families two betrayals several transformations. Everything makes sense if you parse the plot but the proceedings remain remote notwithstanding Benoit Delhommes vivid photography. The only one having any fun is Vera Farmiga as Oana a Russian whore. ""If you work with nature"" Oana asks the professionally green Will who resists her blandishments ""why are you against nature?"" A non sequitur perhaps but welcome relief from overworked sequiturs. An Unreasonable Man Depending on ones point of view the Democrats lost the 2000 presidential election because Ralph Nader was a crazy zealot who wouldnt drop out; because Ralph Nader harbored a Leninist belief that things must get worse before they get better; because Ralph Nader couldnt betray his principles by dropping out or because the Democrats couldnt figure out how to win. All of the above theories are examined in ""An Unreasonable Man"" a substantial if overlong documentary feature by Henriette Mantel and Steve Skrovan. And which theory is favored? The tip-off can be found at the start of the film in the passage from George Bernard Shaws ""Man and Superman"" that provides the title ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."" Many things are well known about Ralph Nader and the film honors them appropriately his 1963 Corvair crusade against General Motors which put him on the map by sending detectives after him and getting caught at it; his ardent advocacy of such consumer causes as seat belts air bags clean air and pure food. (He once called hot dogs ""missiles of death."") ""An Unreasonable Man"" also contains its share of oddments and revelations. A glimpse of his office through a barely open door suggests the document-choked lair of a certified pack rat. During an exquisitely ill-at-ease appearance on Saturday Night Live he wore an airbag that was supposed to deploy but didnt. George McGovern wanted to consider him as a running mate in 1972 but Mr. Naders influence declined precipitously during the Reagan years when support from the Democrats waned as well and that influence didnt begin to rebound until he reinvented himself as an ever more outspoken outsider. ""An Unreasonable Man"" doesnt polish its subjects reputation -- his detractors call him deluded or worse -- or soften his hard edges He calls the nations political system ""one corporate party with two heads."" But the film contends admiringly and convincingly that Ralph Naders authentic sense of outrage is the reason he persists when he cant prevail.    DVD TIP East Germany never looked bleaker -- I mean more atmospheric -- than in ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" (1965) the screen version directed by Martin Ritt of John Le Carres classic cold war thriller. Richard Burton is Alec Leamas the bleak-souled British agent who stalks an East German operative played by Oskar Werner.

I spy humanity | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesI spy humanityIts 1984 in East Germany and there may be no place else on Earth that so closely embodies what George Orwell imagined. Not only are we observing a society governed by oppression paranoia treachery and insidious state control were in a place where the predominant colour everywhere is grey. And theres no escape. Inside even the decor is brutal.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Feb. 9 2007Starring Martina Gedeck Ulrich Muhe Sebastian Koch Ulrich Tukur Thomas ThiemeWritten and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. 137 minutes. At the Cumberland. 14AIts 1984 in East Germany and there may be no place else on Earth that so closely embodies what George Orwell imagined. Not only are we observing a society governed by oppression paranoia treachery and insidious state control were in a place where the predominant colour everywhere is grey. And theres no escape. Inside even the decor is brutal.A huge hit in Germany and a current Best Foreign Language Academy Award nominee 33-year-old writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarcks movie about the stirring of a cold Communist soul manages to be both painstakingly docudramatic and moistly idealistic at the same time.Set as it is in the twilight decade of the Eastern Bloc it cant help but suggest that the very same exposure to beauty that reforms its central character - an unquestioningly devoted morally embalmed state spy played by Ulrich Muhe will eventually melt the entire Iron Curtain.Article Continued BelowWhich is a nice idea but it makes you wonder if wed just blasted Beethoven in their general direction decades ago maybe the Commies might have melted before the Cold War even began.Opening with a sequence depicting Muhes Stasi agent Wiesler offering interrogation tips to fresh functionaries the movie quickly establishes a tone of creepy bureaucratic sociopathology. After suggesting his students pay particular attention to the warmth of the seats where the interrogated sit he quietly marks a damning `x beside the name of a young man who dares to question the efficiency of Wieslers method.For a while von Donnersmarcks movie sustains this sense of quiet pervasive brutality. When Wiesler attends the production of a play written by the states token non-subversive artist (Dreyman played by Sebastian Koch) you can almost smell the loathing the bureaucrat feels for the artist and you understand perfectly why hed leap at the chance to park himself in a cold attic for hours at a time in order to eavesdrop on the playwright and his equally famous live-in actress girlfriend (Christa-Maria played by Martina Gedeck). For this is a man who is everything Wiesler will never be (celebrated artistic intellectual) and has everything Wiesler will never have - namely a beautiful live-in actress girlfriend. (And as we quickly see a well-furnished apartment. To underscore the latter points von Donnersmarck includes a sequence wherein Wiesler heads home to his joylessly Spartan flat for an especially sad little sexual encounter with an indifferent hooker.)As potentially fascinating as this situations playing out might be - and I was frankly hoping for a movie about an unredeemably bitter Communist functionary - its not the situation The Lives of Others is interested in pursuing. This is evident the moment we realize the motivation for the surveillance has more to do with melodrama than politics. The porcine minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme) possessed of lustful yen for Christa-Maria has set up the operation to keep an eye on the object of his appetite. And Wieslers real role is to act as the state version of a spouse-tracking private eye. Hempf wants evidence of the playwrights subversion in order to lock him as far away from Christa-Maria possible.Realizing the personal agenda behind his assignment and growing increasingly more enamoured of the culturally fermented enviably loving lives of the unsuspecting couple (a passion that reaches its most blatant expression when Wiesler actually cries upon overhearing Dreyman play a piano sonata) the Stasi hard-ass begins to soften - and to wonder if he shouldnt intervene at his own considerable personal and professional peril. With a situation clearly derived from Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation (in which Gene Hackmans equally friendless audio surveillance expert tries to prevent a murder) The Lives of Others ultimately offers the reassuring spectacle of an ideological monster redeemed.Touched by the humanity of those whose lives he becomes too intimately proximate to Wiesler puts his heart before the state.While the fact that state will soon fall is not directly attributed to one mans crying over a piano sonata those tears cannot help but symbolize something larger a leak of genuine humanity that will eventually lead to complete collapse. Were that it were true. But thats one of the reasons people have always preferred movies to politics. They make complicated matters seem so simple.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"The best surveillance movie since The Conversation. Slate Sign In Sign Up The best surveillance movie since The Conversation. The best surveillance movie since The Conversation. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 8 2007 624 PM Desperate Bureaucrats The Lives of Others is the best surveillance movie since The Conversation. By Dana Stevens The Lives of Others German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck has said that Western audiences (those from West Berlin he means but its all the more true for those of us points farther West) tend to regard his debut feature The Lives of Others as a thriller while East Berliners experience it as a kind of therapy. The stunning thing about The Lives of Others a nominee for the best foreign language film Oscar that all but swept the German Lola awards last year is that its equally powerful as both. Its an intricate ambiguous and deeply satisfying movie a tautly plotted tale of state surveillance and personal betrayal that ultimately becomes an ode to the transformative power of art. The film opens in 1984 in East Berlin where we see Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) a captain of the East German secret police teaching a class in extreme interrogation techniques. These include sleep deprivation the spouting of Orwellian paradoxes (if the prisoner believes the state capable of detaining him for no reason that belief alone is enough to justify his arrest) and in a creepy detail the collection of the prisoners seat cushion after the interview to be preserved as an odor sample for police dogs. The real intrigue begins when Wiesler is assigned to bug and monitor the apartment of a successful writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend a famous stage actress named Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Georg is neither a subversive nor a party loyalist Hes a go-along-to-get-along guy too comfortable with his success to question the regime closely even as it closes in on his scruffier and more outspoken fellow artists. But Wieslers superior Col. Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) wants to further his career by impressing the party bigwig Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) who is looking to get his swinish mitts on Christa-Maria by any means necessary. And Wiesler himself is a rigid ideologue a socialist automaton who mistrusts all artists on principle--even if the meticulous care with which he runs his own surveillance operation hints at a thwarted creative desire. Advertisement I dont want to give away too much about the films second act in which Wiesler starts to steal the couples poetry books falsify his reports to headquarters and seek Christa-Maria out during his off hours for anonymous encounters in cafes. Ill just say that more than any film since Coppolas The Conversation The Lives of Others gets at the perverse intimacy of the surveillance relationship. Monitoring someones every banal conversation and passionate moment (typing up notes on Georgs birthday Wiesler writes ""[They] unwrap gifts then presumably have intercourse"") is an act that places both listener and listened-to in a strange position of powerlessness. The wiretapee is subjected to the sickening indignity of having his privacy stolen away moment by moment while the wiretapper is trapped in a limbo of vicarious existence waiting for something to happen that will justify that invasion. Bugging someones house you become at once their lover and their enemy. The films ingeniously structured story mines this paradoxical relationship for all its dramatic possibility keeping us guessing till the last moment about who will betray whom and with what consequences. Ulrich Muhe an East German theater actor who was himself tracked by the Stasi before the reunification plays Wiesler not as a psychotic sadist but as an emotionally impoverished bureaucrat. His unnaturally stiff posture and futuristic gray jacket give him an artificial almost robotic quality. Without resorting to pathos Muhe finds the humanity in this ascetic soldierly man especially in the devastating coda set four years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He steals the movie even from the top-billed Martina Gedeck (Mostly Martha) whos haunting as the self-loathing drug-addicted Christa-Maria. Sebastian Koch has the lothario-gone-to-seed look of a midperiod Robert Wagner and invests the writer with just the right mixture of idealism and self-regard. The movie falters only in the character of the repulsive Hempf. His overtures toward the actress are so crudely villainous that they play like simple melodrama where there could have been a subtle exploration of the sexual favors that grease the wheels of the police state. Only a film crew with some experience of living in such a state could do such a merciless job rendering the joyless yellowish-gray interiors of the pre-glasnost GDR. Never has on-screen food looked less appetizing In the Stasi cafeteria officers and recruits alike bolt down dingy bowls of gruel and hockey pucks of fried potato. The films general atmosphere of drab anomie renders the rare moments of pleasure--including a scene in which Georg plays the piano eliciting tears from the eavesdropping Wiesler--all the more moving. Von Donnersmarcks film is set in a world where freedom isnt an abstract concept to be taken for granted--its a distant promise that is enough to make bureaucrats in headphones weep.

Set in East Germany in 1984 five years before the collapse of the Berlin Wall its about the machinations of the Stasi the East German secret police that employed 100000 and had twice that number acting as informants.Stasi Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe) is at first presented as the ultimate company man. A human lie detector he wears down a suspect in detention with his ice-cold methodology and laser eyes.Wiesler believes that no one is above suspicion and his latest target is Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) a playwright who is regaled as ""our only nonsubversive writer who is read in the West."" Dreyman is seemingly loyal to the communist cause but Wiesler simply cant believe hes clean. So he decides to investigate Dreyman by wiring his apartment and monitoring every whisper. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? He has an added motive Culture Minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme) is hot for Dreymans live-in girlfriend Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) a leading stage actress and wants the playwright out of the way. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 What makes ""The Lives of Others"" more than just an elaborate secret police procedural is the way its writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - what a mouthful of a monicker - allows us to see Wiesler as a human being and not as a wiretap. Hidden in his espionage chamber with earphones clapped to his head Wiesler may seem robotic but over time he realizes that it is he and not Dreyman who is perpetrating an injustice.Von Donnersmarck isnt the most elegant storyteller and at 137 minutes the film is overlong. The plot is just short of formulaic and it has at least three endings - although the final one is so touching that it makes you forget the others.But he captures the omnipresent paranoia that is built into his story. Particularly horrific is a scene in a Stasi commissary where a young staffer makes an innocent joke about East German leader Erich Honecker. His superiors overhear it and suddenly the temperature in the room drops to subarctic levels.The director is also fortunate to have cast actors who fully embody their roles. Muehe who once played Josef Mengele in Costa-Gavrass ""Amen"" has the ability to let you see far beneath his masklike countenance. Koch dashing and intense is entirely believable as a man of the theater; Gedeck exudes a sensuousness that this covert society cannot abide.The film is nominated for this years best foreign film Oscar. Grade B+ Rated R for some sexuality and nudity. Next up IKEA apologizes for using forced labor to make furniture Stasi-linked party is back in power. Is Germany ready?

East Germans lived it in 1984 when Big Brother -- more concretely the Stasi the countrys relentless secret police -- was in point of fact watching everyone in the Communist German Democratic Republic. The utterly riveting fictional drama The Lives of Others re-creates that dismayingly recent era of paranoia and privation without an ounce of the nostalgia popular in recent wry post-ironic movie escapes like 2004s Good Bye Lenin In the East Berlin created by notably self-assured 33-year-old writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck everyone has reason to look over his shoulder especially with a Stasi officer like Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe perfecting an X-ray stare) on the job. An unwavering believer in his countrys political philosophy and the need for vigilance to enforce those ""ideals"" Wiesler prides himself on his ability to expose even the smallest chinks in the armor of citizen compliance. He is a colorless nowhere man to the bone the ultimate company tool. Yet Muhe finds a mesmerizing way to make a substantive thinking individual out of what might have been a shadowy villain. Brought to the theater by a colleague to see the latest play by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) a successful model ""nonsubversive"" artist with a respectful following in the West the Stasi man is convinced he can find the wrong behind the playwrights apparent veneer of right. And so having thoroughly bugged Dreymans apartment he sets up his listening post on a floor above to begin spying on (and interfering with) lives of others that are as humanly fluid inconsistent and unpredictable as his is rigid. The filmmakers control of story and pacing is so wily his script so literate (in his feature debut no less) that to reveal much more would interfere with the thrill of the tentacled plots twists. Lets just say that Wiesler discovers early on that Dreymans lover and theatrical leading lady (Martina Gedeck) is the pet of a powerful culture minister and ex-Stasi officer. Some of the movies tensest moments take place with the most minimal of action -- Wiesler simply listening through headphones Dreyman simply lying on his bed a neighbor simply looking through a door peephole her whole life contingent on what she does about what she sees. In those nerve-racking pauses (handled by a strong understated cast) von Donnersmarck conveys everything he wants us to know about choice fear doubt cowardice and heroism. The Lives of Others (a deserving Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film) is at heart a thriller and thrillers depend on turns of event that are inevitably artificial. No one is likely to confuse this Stasi mans story with ""reality."" But no one can doubt the veracity of the human unpredictability the movie captures either.

"Lives of Others The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lives-of-others-the ) Lives of Others The (Germany 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its no secret that some of the most powerful dramas are those that depict character transformations. Such is the case with The Lives of Others the stirring and affecting feature debut of German filmmaker Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. With a deft hand von Donnersmarck engages us in the life of a cold dispassionate character then takes us on a journey that transforms him from detached observer to involved partisan. The film is careful to avoid overt melodrama but at the same time it engages the emotions. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the movie is the complexity and intelligence evident in the screenplay which offers multiple valid interpretations for certain actions but never insults the audience by insisting upon one. A contender for the 2007 Best Foreign Language Film Oscar and major player in European and Film Festival awards The Lives of Others is deserving of the accolades it has thus far obtained. Its 1984 in East Germany and Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a respected by-the-book member of the Stasi. He is a master interrogator and teaches classes about how to recognize when a suspect is lying. He is asked by his superior Grubitz (Ulrich Turkur) to head up a surveillance mission of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress-girlfriend Crista Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman appears to be a good socialist and he never overtly criticizes the GDR but Grubitz suspects he may be leading a double life. To complicate matters a highly placed minister (Thomas Thieme) wants Crista for his own - something that would be facilitated if Dreyman was out of the picture. Weisler goes into the mission intending to uncover instances of Dreymans anti-state duplicity but the more he listens to what transpires Dreymans apartment the more involved he becomes in the playwrights day-to-day living. Weisler also develops protective instincts for Dreyman and Crista and makes the leap from observer to participant as he seeks to keep them from making decisions that will ruin their futures. The seduction depicted in The Lives of Others is unintentional. Wiesler is enticed by the possibility of art meaning and love all of which are absent from his existence but present in that of Dreyman and Crista. Wiesler lives in a Spartan apartment with nothing to distinguish it from a hotel room and when he desires company he calls a prostitute. By listening to Dreyman and Crista he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually his desire to be part of something meaningful leads him to act to protect the couple even though his actions violate the law and place his career in jeopardy. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time their roles are to act as catalysts. This is Wieslers story and although there are moments of tragedy its ultimately one of redemption. The film is crafted in such a way that we achieve a catharsis without feeling manipulated. The Lives of Others allows us to understand this distant unloved character and be willing to accompany him on an emotional journey that leads to unexpected destinations. Its a bonus that the subjects of his surveillance are interesting and worth spending time with as well. That enriches the films tapestry and adds layers to the resolution. As Wiesler Ulrich Muhe is note-perfect capturing the gradual changes to his character with aplomb. According to von Donnersmarck the part was written with Muhe in mind which may be a clue as to why theres such synergy between the actor and his screen counterpart. Co-stars Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch are also effective but neither is able to steal the film away from Muhe whose low-key approach makes him the surprising centerpiece of many scenes most notably the one in which he eavesdrops as Dreyman plays a piano sonata (""Sonata for a Good Man."") The strength of The Lives of Others is that it works on numerous levels - especially in the way it approaches Wieslers complexity as an individual - and that none of the characters are one-dimensional or facile. With solid performances and a terrific screenplay this movie offers solid no-frills drama that feels organic and believable not contrived. Whether or not this is the best foreign language film of 2006 is debatable but there should be no argument that it is deserving to be numbered among the elite non-English language productions receiving international distribution.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Spy vs. Spy The Lives of Others appeals to our betterand baserinstincts. Factory Girl has no appeal at all. _ By David Edelstein ShareThis (Photo Hagen Keller/Courtesy of Sony Pictures) A s Gerd Wiesler a masterful interrogator in the East German secret police (the Stasi) and the fulcrum of the fraught melodrama The Lives of Others Ulrich Muhe gives a marvelously self-contained performance. There isnt an ounce of fat on his body or in his acting He has pared himself down to a pair of eyes that prowl the faces of his characters countrymen for signs of arrogancei.e. of independent thinking. But if Wiesler has shed all traces of nonessential humanity he has just enough empathy to burrow into his prisoners heads and reduce them over time to cringing wrecks. Belief in the mission of the German Democratic Republicand the resourcefulness of its enemieskeeps him patient and centered in his labors. It hardly seems to matter that his most intimate exchanges are with the people whose lives he destroys. Until now. The first film by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck The Lives of Others is a cunning piece of constructiona Kafkaesque tearjerker a tragic farce. Set in the mid-eighties before Gorby and glasnost the movie centers on Wieslers surveillance of a pair of national celebrities the playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch)the only nonsubversive [GDR] writer still read in the West were toldand his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Its Wiesler who proposes that surveillancehe doesnt like Dreymans haughty expression at the opening of his latest play. But when this loyal Stasi officer discovers that the operation was fast-tracked because the odious minister of Culture (Thomas Thieme) wants sole possession of the comely Christa-Maria his moral compass begins to wander. As he eavesdrops in the dark attic above the couples apartment hes slowly drawn out of himself and into the lives of others. Movies can appeal to our best and worst instinctsits when they appeal to both at once that they get really interesting. We fear for the freedom of the vulnerable couple yet on some level its a kick to spy on them along with Wieslerto listen in on mundane conversations in a culture in which theres no sphere of privacy and to think What stray complaint can be used as proof of disloyalty? There are so many from which to choose We root for Wieslers conscience to thaw yet the movies cruelest irony is that whenever he manages to do something decent it always rebounds on the people he seeks to protect. In a system that perverts the most ordinary interactions few good deeds go unpunished. Christa-Maria is dealt the worst hand Her stage career could end abruptly if she doesnt put out for the cultural commissar. Gedeck the winsome star of Mostly Martha takes the actresss indecisiveness to operatic heightsbut does her defiler have to be this repulsive? When she allows him to paw her in a limo the scene is like something out of a Victorian melodrama. (The director could have suggested that power has its attractions How else to account for all the women that Henry Kissinger got?) BACKSTORYWhen East Germany collapsed in 1989 it was estimated that one in 50 citizens worked for the Stasi in some waythe secret police employed about 300000 informants and 102000 full-time employees. In 1991 Germany passed the Stasi Records Law which declassified files and Germans were dismayed to discover some spies in unlikely places. Heinrich Fink vice-chancellor at East Berlins Humboldt University was found to have been an informant since 1968 and respected churchman Hans-Joachim Rotch director of Leipzigs Thomas Church choir was also a longtime informer. T he longish denouement of The Lives of Others takes place years after the main action and is clearly designed to soften the blow. Its corny and contrived but we seize on it with reliefas we seize on the Mahleresque romanticism of Gabriel Yareds score. A harsher landing is provided by the documentary The Decomposition of the Soul which plays from February 7 to 13 at Film Forum. Directed by Nina Toussaint and Massimo Iannetta its a hushed poetic meditation on the life of Stasi prisoners in which two former inmates Hartmut Richter and Sigrid Paul traipse in and out of empty cells and interrogation rooms in the Berlin-Hohenschonhausen which operated from 1951 until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. As they softly relay their storiesof sleep and sensory deprivation of the interrogators sadistic tricks of the dangling of false hope the camera fastens on stools desks and other ordinary objects. We fix on them the way the prisoners must have grasping for solidity in a fast-dissolving world. The decomposition of the soul is the goal of a Stasi incarceration the promised end for an enemy of the state and there is something about the movies pacingthe silences the drone of the narration (The name of your enemy is hope )that wears you down. Sigrid Paul remembers how she found a loose thread and spent hours twisting it into different shapesuntil the guards burst in took it away and took her mattress away for good measure. How brilliant of the Stasi to give new meaning to the phrase hanging by a thread. S omeone had peed on the floor of the small Times Square auditorium at the only critics screening of Factory Girl which had some audience members speculating on whether this was (a) an advance review of the movie or (b) an attempt to transport us back to the Deuce in the age of Andy Warhols Factory. A powerful antibacterial agent took care of the theaters smell but not the films. 1 2 Next Share this story...

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Admittedly no one as distinctive as Herzog has yet appeared though there are a few promising talents whose work echoes that of early Fassbinder and Wenders. And this particular multi-award-winning first feature might at least be seen as the sort of strong solid politically relevant genre piece that used to be Volker Schlondorffs speciality. A remarkably assured work it paints an altogether darker picture of life under East Germanys Communist regime than the almost cosy existence nostalgically evoked by the likes of Good Bye Lenin Set for the most part in East Berlin during the mid-1980s it charts the consequences of the Minister of Cultures decision to investigate by means of the intense surveillance practised as a matter of course by the Stasi the political affiliations and activities of playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress lover Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) - for whose sexual favours the politician brazenly lusts. Its not just the artists and their friends whose lives are profoundly affected by the bugging of the couples apartment but also that of Captain Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) the surveillance expert put in charge of spying on them who gradually comes to question the ethics of his work for the state police.Von Donnersmarcks complex but lucid script with its wholly credible twists and Hagen Bogdanskis sombre noir-inflected camerawork together serve not only to establish a brooding atmosphere of fear doubt and suspicion but to create a suspenseful thriller of no little contemporary relevance to a world where fundamental civil liberties are increasingly at risk of being undermined. Only a slightly distended ending weakens the films grip; even then however the performances remain superb ensuring that the movie succeeds both as unusually convincing historical recreation and as an utterly compelling tale of individuals whose lives are shaped - tragically - by the society they live in.

There is only one thing that lets it down slightly and that is the subtitles. They are so terrible they do not represent the dialogue. They killed the boys joke in the stasi canteen and misrepresented the fact that the playwrite gave at least the appearance of being in favour of the regime through his work even if his friend was a dissident.

The reasons for WiesleraEUR(tm)s sudden epiphany were not spelt out directly for the viewer but were entirely compelling and credible nonetheless. His conversion from brainwashed communist apparatchik into free thinking and empathetic human being were brought about by his very intrusion into the lives of others he was sent to spy on.

The events in the film unfold because all 3 men are in love with Christa; that she may in fact be unworthy of their love is not the point. In the end Wiseler is the true good man - his integrity intact just like The Good Soldier or The Great Gatsby before him.

The real beauty of this film for me above all else is that it is so untypical German. I say this because it really packs an emotional punch and although we see the film begin with an examination of interrogation techniques so typically associated with the cold war era the film moves tensely but patiently into a very normal group of actors actresses playwrights poets and Directors doing very ordinary things. These were not Western Capitalists desperate to free themselves from a regime; these were just artists wanting to express their art on an everyday level. So here I think lies the conflict for the authorities. How could or should they deal with this group of people? These were not an underground resistance they were just artists with a passion for books music and film and because they did not overtly conform to the normal way of thinking they were deemed a dangerous appendage on German Society. As the film gathers momentum we begin to almost will the Stasi officer Wiesler played by Ulriche Muhe (who himself was spied on for many years) to tell Dreyman (played by Sebastian Koch) that he need not worry because he has an Angel literally over his head. Muhe seems to almost enjoy the cat and mouse confrontation with his superior who can only worry about his own promotional prospects by digging some dirt on Dreyman who happens to be living with a drug dependant girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (who is secretly conducting an affair with a party official in return for drugs and a long acting career). Muhe is torn between what he knows he should do but also with what he feels he should do and after being drawn in by the music of Beethoven he begins to embark on a dangerous and incredibly tense journey to do something even if it is to his own detriment. I was so moved by this film that I watched the final 15 minutes again and again to think that the Stasi files gathered on all the individuals over so many years would if stretched run for over 100 kilometres we begin to understand exactly how meticulous and paranoid the regime actually was. Regardless of all the underlying political message this film is a triumph on every level beautifully crafted intelligently written and set to the wonderful sounds of Gabriel Yareds musical score (better known for Talented Mr Ripley) I urge everyone to watch this film and enjoy it as much as I did.

Like the omnipresent tentacles of East Germanys onetime secret police ""The Lives of Others"" grips like a boa constrictor. Superbly cast drama centered on a loyal Stasi officer and a writer he spies on just prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall is a socko feature debut by scripter-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck that looks to be a solid upscale attraction wherever the special chemistry of good writing and performances is appreciated. Inexplicably absent from the lineups of both the Berlin and Cannes festivals this year pic deserves major fest slots prior to specialized theatrical and tube play. Since its mid-March local release the movie has hunted down more than 11 million in 11 weeks and been showered with kudos -- four at the Bavarian Film Awards and seven at the national German Film Awards (Lolas). Latter included best film director actor (Ulrich Muehe) and screenplay. Though the pic lacks the marketable Hitler hook of ""Downfall"" and is not based on a real-life event it looks set to benefit from growing offshore awareness of well-crafted German dramas inspired by recent history. In tone and the way the drama is allowed to grow from the coolly objective helming ""Lives of Others"" is closer to last years ""Sophie Scholl The Final Days"" and has an equally powerful finish. The time is 1984 the place East Berlin and per an opening title ""glasnost is nowhere in sight."" The population of East Germany is controlled by the Stasis 100000 employees and 200000 informers whose goal is to know everything about the lives of others. Among the most devoted of the Stasis officers is Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Muehe all hollow-eyed expressionless stare) who can smell a dissident at a thousand paces and has no life beyond his work. At a performance of the latest play by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) -- ""our only non-subversive writer whos read in the West"" -- he decides almost as a personal challenge to investigate the playwright whom Wiesler cant believe is as clean as he seems. Supported by a longtime colleague Lt.-Col. Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur radiating ruthless bonhomie) head of the Cultural Dept. and former Stasi officer-turned-minister Hempf (Thomas Thieme channeling the late Gerd Froebe) Wiesler has Dreymans apartment wired. But Wiesler cant pin anything on the scribe who genuinely believes in East Germanys socialist ideals. Rather the pics dramatic motor is Wiesler becoming fascinated by Dreymans life and his live-in relationship with actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). When Hempf whos taken a liking to Christa-Maria orders Wiesler to pin something on Dreyman to get him out of the way the loyal Stasi acolyte finds himself in a quandary for the first time in his career. Meantime Dreyman also has his beliefs shaken by the suicide of an old friend stage director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert). Complex script balances the many dramatic and emotional strands between the players with poise and clarity. Though the film is talky small-scale and has almost no physical action it grips from the opening frame simply through the power of the performances and the way in which it doesnt stray down the usual political-thriller paths with simple stereotypes. When Wiesler turns from an observer of peoples lives to a manipulator and participant and is caught like a rat in his own trap he becomes as fleet-footed as any dissident. Final two reels take the story beyond the fall of the Wall into the early 90s. Though thats initially jolting -- just when the pic appears to have finished -- the dramatic gamble does pay off tying up some loose plot-ends in a simple but emotionally powerful conclusion that makes the story resonate into present-day Germans lives. Top-billed Gedeck is fine as the actress torn between her career and personal emotions but the movie is Muehes an East German-born legit thesp known for his roles in Michael Haneke films and as Dr. Mengele in Costa-Gavras ""Amen."" Communicating much through the smallest actions Muehe is especially good opposite Tukur as his wily superior. Scripts strain of black comedy -- best seen in a commissary scene where a Stasi staffer unwisely cracks a joke about East German leader Erich Honecker -- is beautifully played by the two vets. Widescreen tech package is clean and tight with art director Silke Buhr and d.p. Hagen Bogdanski creating a slightly stylized look by playing up grays and dour greens even when using actual locations like the Stasis onetime HQ in Normannenstrasse. Period detail looks just right; Gabriel Yareds symphonic score adds atmosphere and tension. The Lives of OthersGermany ProductionA Buena Vista Intl.
