An increasingly tired-looking Brendan Fraser dusts off the boots and bomber jacket as Rick Ricochet OConnell this time heading to China with thrillseeking missus Evy (Maria Bello) to deliver an artefact to a museum only to be ambushed by a tyrannical general who wants to resurrect the long-dead Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) to well... who knows why? John Hannah reprises his role as stock babbling twit while newcomer Luke Ford - an eminently slappable 1970s waxwork of Matt Damon - crops up as Ricks annoyingly impetuous son Alex. Creating the sense that one eye seems to have been on the films potential for computer-game spin-offs with the other on the prospect of interactive museum tie-ins Rob Cohens pallid direction combined with a script packed with groan-worthy quips and dimestore mysticism merely drags the characters from point A to point B. The humour fun and B-movie self-depreciation of the first two chapters are also woefully absent.

Why? Well I`ll be brief but basics... 1.No real story at all. 2. The change of Evy to a different actress was a terrible mistake. the new actress was badly chosen but what they should have done was just say that the Heroe`s wife was sick divorced or just plain dead cos that blew believability bigtime right there. Even Brendan looked tired and even embarrassed at having to pretend he knew someone he didn`t. 3. The son looked too old. 4. Ok I can take Yetis. But there`s no explanation of how and why? they appear are super-friendly and vanish. Completely unbelievable. Only 10 year olds could watch it. 5. Totally rubbish ending. Jet Li wasted. And that`s only a few of the things wrong with it. I wasted 2 hours with my 17 year old daughter and she being a big fan of the Mummy films was left very quiet. Absolute rubbish advised for 10 years and younger only.

I walked out of the cinema smiling -). (too bad i didnt after avp II and i was hoping for that after seeing trailer) Maybe there could be more humour scenes like in first Mummy movie but it was great entertainment and I would gladly see it again. I always liked adventure movies. And I liked Maria Bello as Mrs. Oconnel. She did a good job and they looked great together. I didnt feel starting from the first scene with her that that change of one of the main characters in the movie would be a minus for the whole movie and mostly it probably is. Its easy to criticise.

Comments The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor A brisk opening sequence with Jet Li as an ancient Chinese warlord and Michelle Yeoh as the witch who curses him gave me hope for this third installment in the fading franchise (following The Mummy in 1999 and The Mummy Returns in 2001). But for a movie about the undead this lacks any supernatural chills and by the time its obligatory final showdown arrives it seems as hollow as the terra-cotta soldiers brought to life by CGI. Brendan Fraser returns as explorer Rick OConnell Maria Bello is miscast as his wife (replacing Rachel Weisz) and Luke Ford is a nonstarter as their rebellious son. John Hannah plays Bellos brother who tags along on their adventure; his big comic moment comes when a yak pukes on him. Rob Cohen directed incoherently. PG-13 112 min.

At crucial junctures in the plot the heroine Ray Eddy drives her battered old Dodge Spirit across the ice-bound St. Lawrence with illegal immigrants hidden in the trunk. The Spirit is willing if the engine is weak but Rays spirit is indomitable. This is a debut feature though youd never know it from the filmmakers commandingly confident style or from the heartbreaking beauty -- heartbreaking then heartmending -- of Melissa Leos performance as a poor single mother whos living her whole life on thin ice. ENLARGE Ray looks like a descendant of the gaunt weary woman in Dorothea Langes iconic photograph from the Great Depression. Her husband has vanished after gambling away the money theyd saved for the balloon payment on a new mobile home leaving her to care for their two sons in a moldering trailer. As Christmas approaches she works at a Yankee One Dollar store but money is so tight that the boys must dine on popcorn and Tang. Yet Ray is a gambler too determined to do whatever she must for her family and her odyssey is anything but depressing. In a setting full of strangeness and danger the strangest thing is how surprising ""Frozen River"" manages to be. Much of that is due to Ms. Hunts fondness for striking details and her gift for dramatizing them in a tale of two equally if differently devoted mothers. Ray lives near a Mohawk Indian reservation where a laconic young Mohawk smuggler Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham) becomes her tutor and her partner in crime. (""Theres no border here"" Lila says with smoldering scorn ""this is free trade between nations."") Ray is no angel either. Shes willing to use the pistol she packs and is quick to suspect a couple of terrified Pakistani immigrants of being terrorists. Her older son T.J. (Charlie McDermott) may be considered trailer trash by his peers but hes so bright and well-spoken that hes able to work a credit-card scam over the phone. Nothing fits neatly in the lives of these characters. Thats a governing principle of Ms. Hunts script and a source of its singular energy. The main source though is the critical mass of tenderness and ferocity in Melissa Leos portrayal. Her character could be more knowledgeable about towing one car with another -- Ray uses a bungee cord which pops apart at the first yank -- but the actress pulls everything and everyone along with her even when grimness or spiritual darkness slow the pace. (Reed Moranos digital photography goes murky in low light but on the whole its strikingly elegant.) You may remember Ms. Leo as Kay Howard the smart tough cop in ""Homicide Life on the Street""; as the devoted wife of Benicio del Toros tortured ex-con in ""21 Grams"" or from any number of supporting roles on TV and in independent films. What she does here though is a revelation and a quiet joy. Theres nothing trashy about Ray as Ms. Leo plays her not even at her lowest ebb. Longing for a better life she makes the most of the one she has. Find television listings for Melissa Leo Brendan Fraser Maria Bello and more at LocateTV. The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor In ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" the climactic battle pits dead good guys and dead bad guys against a dead script that contains the deathless line ""Theres something incredibly romantic about vanquishing the undead."" No there isnt at least not on the evidence offered here but theres something incredibly perverse about a third ""Mummy"" installment that lacks a standard mummy and something incredibly turgid about the bonhomie-cum-rivalry between Rick OConnell the mummy-hunter played by Brendan Fraser and his twerpy archaeologist son. This ""Mummy"" which was directed by Rob Cohen starts pleasantly enough with a preface set in ancient China where good contends with evil under bright skies not yet laden with particulate matter and a good witch played by Michelle Yeoh casts a Sanskrit spell on the evil emperor. (Why Sanskrit? Because hed know he was in trouble if her spell were in Chinese.) The problems begin once the action moves to the 20th century -- 1946 right after World War II -- and the writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar must construct an actual story. They construct one all right but from parts recycled as frequently as aluminum cans an archaeological find thats the greatest since King Tut; a legendary jewel abominable snowmen an arduous journey to Shangri-La and yet another encounter with the evil emperor who shifts shapes whenever the script runs out of ideas. The production looks lavish unless you look too closely and the action ranges from spirited (the undead outdoing the supposedly living) to clumsy (chopped-up battle sequences rusty kung fu wire work). Maria Bello does her attractive best as Ricks wife Evelyn who was previously played by Rachel Weisz while Brendan Fraser gives his some to a role that doesnt deserve it. The best news about this clangorous clunker is that it may well have vanquished the ""Mummy"" franchise. DVD TIP When the roll call is read for ferociously devoted movie mothers Margaret Hall will merit a place toward the top of the list. Shes the mother played by Tilda Swinton in ""The Deep End"" (2001) a thriller directed by Scott McGehee and David Siegel who based their script on a 1940s novel by Elizabeth Sanxay Holding. After the body of her older sons gay lover washes up on a beach in front of her lakefront house Margaret goes off the deep end herself in the course of doing what seems necessary to protect her son. This mothers love knows no bounds. Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (out of four)Stars Brendan Fraser Jet Li Maria Bello Michelle Yeoh Luke Ford John Hannah Isabella Leong Director Rob CohenDistributor UniversalRating PG-13 for adventure action and violenceRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesOpens Friday nationwide SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Mike Clark USA TODAY Lets pretend -- though its far less of a stretch than what transpires on screen -- that The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is subject to the same pre-flight checklist that pilots perform. The goal to determine whether summer cinemas latest sequel has the indispensable components audiences demand from the latest round of Mummy pics. Two Abominable Snowmen? Check. SUMMER MOVIE CALENDAR Popcorn flicks keep on coming Jet Li? Check. A three-headed flying dragon? Check. A callow hunk who plays an archaeologist? Check. What it doesnt have is a mummy. You half expect that along with the kitchen sink this franchise killer would throw in an ABBA soundtrack but Universal has already done that with Mamma Mia. Instead the worlds longest voice-over introduces a prologue in which a sorceress-with-a-cause (Michelle Yeoh) turns Lis ruthless Dragon Emperor into stone for centuries after first making him burst into flame. But because the hunk (Luke Ford as the son of Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello) digs him up all sorts of abominable and Abominable mayhem transpires in 1946 Shanghai and Shangri-La. Bello replaces Rachel Weisz who after her Constant Gardener Oscar needed this movie like Bill Cosby needed Ghost Dad. Normally reliable Bello jolts with a forced British accent that sounds as if she dropped out of Henry Higgins mail-order course sophomore year. And even if Ford looked younger than he does here youd still guess that she and Fraser conceived him at an age when someone should have been calling Social Services. Remarkably the plot has much in common with Hellboy II The Golden Army yet that bundle of fun has enough vision to make even its Barry Manilow interlude seem appropriate. In addition to wretched bantering and the second hours combative ""Crouching Snowmen Renewed Dragon"" nonsense Tomb far more haphazardly orders everything off the menu as if it were taking part in someones ""with 200 you get egg roll"" promotion. Anyone seeing it will spend the following week pretending Tums is a food group. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Its a wrap for Mummy movies | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsIts a wrap for Mummy moviesA third instalment of The Mummy franchise is almost as inviting as the thought of a third term for George W. Bush.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 1 2008 The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor Starring Brendan Fraser Maria Bello Jet Li John Hannah Michelle Yeoh and Luke Ford. Directed by Rob Cohen. 112 minurtes. At major theatres. PG A third instalment of The Mummy franchise is almost as inviting as the thought of a third term for George W. Bush.Especially when you consider how much The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has going against it seven long years after this irredeemable action series last busted our block. Rachel Weisz whose lively banter with co-star Brendan Fraser helped relieve the tedium of digital cadavers wisely chose to take a pass on this quick-buck exercise. Shes been replaced by Maria Bello a fine actor but also the game-winning poser for this future Jeopardy answer ""Least-likely person to fill Rachel Weiszs shoes in The Mummy series.""Also missing in action is Stephen Sommers director of The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001). His limitations as a helmer seem positively trivial compared to the awesome hackitude of his successor Rob Cohen (The Fast and the Furious) whose complete lack of focus suggests hes suffering from an undiagnosed case of Tourettes Syndrome.Then theres the rather major matter of the missing mummy which could inspire legions of fanboys to dig up a class-action suit against Universal Pictures on grounds of false advertising. The fearsome Egyptian mummy Imhotep has been replaced by digitized Chinese Terracotta Warriors led by Jet Lis ceramic-chewing cameo of a fascist emperor. No way are Li and his set true mummies according to my scholarly research on Wikipedia.Two other major cast additions are equally alarming. Michelle Yeoh plays an ancient witch who consigns Lis emperor to eternal statuary pending the utterance of various oaths and other acts of hokum. Yeoh must really have needed the money.And Australias Luke Ford 27 plays Alex the very grown-up son of adventurous couple Rick and Evelyn OConnell who are played by Fraser 39 and Bello 41. No explanation is offered why boyish Rick and peppy Evelyn would have become parents at approximately the ages of 12 and 14.But really why quibble over the details when the entire movie explodes like a bomb designed to leave skulls intact but dissolve brains within? Written by Shanghai Noon and Smallville scribblers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar who didnt require more than a single cocktail napkin between them this Tomb looks like it was first raided and then stuffed with plastic trinkets.Speaking of raiding did Gough and Millar have an advance peek at the script of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull? There are striking similarities between Mummy 3 and Indy IV but the former doesnt profit from the latter.After a lengthy prologue in which the requisite ancient battle between good and evil leaves Li in a frozen funk the scene jumps to 1947 where a still-youthful Rick and Evelyn are semi-retired and living in splendour in an English manor.Events rapidly conspire to send them to Shanghai with a rare orb (almost as fake as those crystal skulls) called the Eye of Shangri-la which we will soon learn (drum roll please) can unleash the bad emperor from his Popsicle prison should it fall into bad hands.Which it does of course despite the best efforts of Rick Evelyn and their impetuous son Alex whom they are reunited with inside Imhotep the quaintly named Egyptian nightclub that Evelyns brother Jonathan (John Hannah ever the obliging comic relief) seems to have modelled on a Cairo cathouse right under the noses of the Chinese authorities.I could go on with further exposition but it would be for naught. The story is no more than a thread stitching set pieces of increasing implausibility and ineptitude. They include a completely incoherent car chase on the streets of Shanghai replete with spontaneous fireworks and a sojourn to the Himalayas where risibly fake Abominable Snowmen are used as both thugs for hire and huggable protectors from avalanches.Did I mention that the revived emperor can change into all manner of things? If only he could form a club and beat himself over the head with it. The Mummy series has always been more about special effects than storytelling. But previous movies have always had a least one good piece of eye candy (like that dusty screaming ghoulie in episode one) and some snappy dialogue for good measure.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is singularly lacking in both virtues and the loss of laughs is the greatest regret. Frasers swashbuckling Rick was always a wink away from letting us know he knew things were pretty silly but he was having a good time regardless.Here hes been reduced to a gun nut a nagging dad and a fairly feckless fighter all with far less cheer than weve come to expect. To quote a line from an infinitely better summer flick ""Why so serious?""Perhaps some witch told him as the movie hints at the end that hes condemned to return for The Mummy IV. Anyone know where we can buy extra-strength embalming fluid?

In the mid-80s-to-mid-90s Golden Age of Hong Kong films Li was mainland Chinas most gifted movie martial artist and Yeoh the preeminent fighting femme. They played together in only one previous picture Tai Chi Master in 1993 the busiest year of the Hong Kong Renaissance when the colonys robust movies enthralled action fans around the globe and the leading actors were worked as hard as pre-teen seamstresses in a Guangzhou garment factory. (Li and Yeoh each made five other films that year.) Now both 45 they have lost little of their agility and none of their screen luster. Their duel atop the Great Wall of China is a reunion of titans an Old Timers Day for two actor-athletes still in their sinuous prime. Forgive the effusions of an alter-kocker fanboy but the flinty glamour of Li and Yeoh -- buttressed by the stolid sneering presence of top Hong Kong villain Anthony Wong Chau-sang (who in 1993 appeared in 15 films) -- is the best reason to catch this third in the series of Indiana Jones knockoffs. Brendan Fraser returns as adventurer Rick OConnell who after vanquishing the same mummy twice in the 1999 and 2001 films finally gets a new old adversary. But its the Hong Kong veterans who are entrusted with Mummy IIIs real action physically and dramatically. In ancient China the Emperor Han (Li) means to secure the secret of eternal life from priestess Zi Juan (Yeoh) who loves the Emperors second-in-command Ming Guo (Amer-Asian hunk Russell Wong; he battled Li in the Hollywood actioner Romeo Must Die). But the priestess has placed a curse on the Emperor his eyes start bleeding a brown syrup and in no time he turns into a chocolate soldier. He and his thousands of soldiers are encased in terracotta -- until 1946 when a modern Chinese general (Anthony Wong) sets Emperor Han free to wreak havoc on his homeland. The big bad guy is back and so is Zu Juan along with the daughter (Isabelle Leong from the Hong Kong horror film The Eye 3) she had by Ming Guo. Age-wise the two heroines are pushing 2300 but theyre still steely of resolve. And dishy. You see? You can relate the movies main plot concocted by writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar without mentioning the Anglos Rick his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello sporting an English accent of varying plumminess) and their grown son Alex (Luke Ford). After their last escapade Rick and Evelyn have sworn off derring-do; she writes books about the good old days while he goes fly-fishing and gets a hook stuck in his neck. Their love life is a comedy of missed opportunities of derring-donts. When the British government asks them to deliver a valuable document to Shanghai they jump at the chance to throw off the sedate life and immerse themselves in the one thing that makes them feel alive peril. It happens that Alex has taken up his dads trade of amateur archaeologist / tomb raider. Guess what hes stumbled on the key to unleashing the Emperor and his army. As directed by Rob Cohen whose high-hack work includes Dragon The Bruce Lee Story and The Fast and the Furious this Mummy movie is really two movies a good adventure epic with all the Chinese people and a wan one with OConnells and the other the Westerners. Their character motivation is sketchy their verbal wit scant; at times a scene revs to its climax and instead of issuing some clever deflating retort the actor will gaze dumbly into the camera as if this were a rough cut with the punch line to be edited in later. To camouflage the dearth of smart dialogue Fraser and Bello indulge in sheepish smiling and sweet preening; the films working title might have been Indianas Clones and the Dimple of Tomb. Fraser and Ford do get to run around a lot and knock out some malefactors but they are largely occupied staring at the real action stars and the special effects. These are pretty terrific. The tomb Alex enters has crafty trap doors and cool gear mechanisms (yes just like the ones in the real Indiana Jones movies but deftly executed nonetheless). The terracotta warriors once they are revived move with the balletic precision of armored Rockettes. Theres a decent chase scene through Shanghai streets with Art Deco buildings draped in chinoiserie. The whole production is handsome and the second-unit work first-rate. Finally Li and Yeoh have their big face-off and the movie rekindles old Hong Kong glories while offering some new ones of its own. The Hong Kong renaissance evaporated about ten years ago as the Peoples Republic took control of the colony; Hollywood summoned many of the best Chinese stars directors and stunt coordinators for occasional work; and after a decade or so of hyperactivity the movement wore itself out allowing American action films to appropriate a little of its supernal energy. That crazy-wonderful movie spirit may be dead now but in The Dragon Emperor youll find some limber ghosts from Hong Kongs Golden Age.

Directed by Rob Cohen. With Brendan Fraser Maria Bello. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey.TWO STARS In ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" an ancient Chinese despot -- entombed for eons in terra cotta -- is restored to a painful shuddering imitation of life. Sort of like this series. Debuting in 1999 the first supernatural swashbuckler was meant as a reboot of the old monster movie and a fill-in for the then much-missed Indiana Jones. Brendan Fraser was the dashing two-fisted Rick ""Ricochet"" OConnell Rachel Weisz was Evelyn the capable British beauty on his arm and tongue was kept firmly in cheek. The movie kept its silliness in check too -- or at least enough of it to provide a pleasant summer entertainment. Mummies walked guns blazed ancient scarab beetles swarmed and audiences flocked -- enough anyway to give rise to a sequel and a misfire of a spin-off starring The Rock. And now in search of more modern treasures the team is back. Except -- like that crumbling clay automaton -- the enterprise is showing signs of age. Instead of 20s Egypt the story is now set in post-war Asia. Rick and Evelyn now have a college-age son Weisz has been replaced by Maria Bello and the plot provides an ancient emperor reanimated by an evil general. None of these is a good idea. Although Fraser is still charming enough theres been no attempt to age him two decades and he doesnt remotely convince as the parent of a twentysomething kid. Bello -- an adult and earthy American actress -- loses much of her appeal dressed in satin and a posh English accent. And Luke Fords bland Alex is not a welcome family addition. The script is similarly second-rate. Even accepting leaps in logic -- its a movie about the walking dead for Ras sake -- the title monster isnt even a mummy and Shangri-La is a steal from ""Lost Horizon."" Tin-eared dialogue -- like a line about respecting ""personal space"" or an ancient emperor suspiciously asking ""Whats in it for you?""-- breaks any illusion of fantasy. Perhaps thats because this movie wasnt so much created as calculated. The move to China seems to have been made not for a change of scenery but to exploit foreign markets (its hard to imagine why theyd hire an Asian star like Jet Li otherwise and then give him little to do). And making the revival of the villain a Nationalist plot -- does that mean that Mao and the Red Army are now the heroes? (That really is a Hollywood first.) Whoever this movie was designed to appeal to however they seem to have forgotten the fans who made the first one such guiltless fun. The jokes are labored and Fraser and Bello have little chemistry (and this is a woman who as ""The Cooler"" proved can bring out the animal in even William H. Macy). Only the move to Tibet enables some action (and Abominable Snowmen). By the time of the last reel a final battle has pitted an army of clay statues against one of angry skeletons. Its fun on a video-game level. But the CGI violence still isnt much more than one mass of pixels confronting another; unlike Ray Harryhausen who sent his animated monsters after a hero director Rob Cohen has them mostly chasing other animated monsters. Its hard to care which army of the dead returns to dust first. The movies already beat them to it anyway. Rating note The film contains violence and threats of a sequel.

Is it when a dead warrior transforms himself into a three-headed dragon? How about when skeletons arise out of their tomb in the Great Wall of China to turn into columns of soldiers from the Ray Harryhausen brigade? Or is it the way Rachel Weisz has turned into Maria Bello? PHOTO GALLERY The Mummy Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor This Mummy is an ancient emperor (Jet Li) whose rampage ended when he was turned to stone by the curse of a benevolent witch (Michelle Yeoh). Looking for his remains in 1946 China is Alex (Luke Ford) the archaeologist son of Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser). By coincidence the senior OConnell is tricked into going to China on a diplomatic mission to return a giant diamond. Ricks wife Evelyn is now played by Bello although under new hair and makeup she manages to look neither like Weisz nor herself. I call foul for illegal substitution; this kind of thing smelled bad when TVs ""Bewitched"" tried it and now that its been rotting for 40 years it hasnt gotten any fresher. Why not just say that the Weisz character died in the 13 years since the last episode and give Rick a new girl? The Evelyn character isnt the same anyway; no longer a feminine scholarly type shes now so fired-up and combat-ready that shes more like Steven Seagal in pumps. Rick and Evelyn join their son the immortal witch Evelyns sidekick brother (John Hannah) and his sons girl (Isabella Leong) who is also the witchs daughter and is also immortal. After the emperor busts out of his stony shell the gang must stop him first from climbing up a mountain to find the way to Shangri-La. Then they must prevent him from making himself immortal by taking a dip in Shangri-Las pool which is apparently even more exclusive than the one on top of Soho House. Each nonsensical scene exists only to unleash the hordes of digital-effects artists. So bring on the undead armies of terra cotta warriors fireworks whizzing around a car chase in Shanghai and mighty yetis that come roaring in out of nowhere. The stunts and CGI keep the action visually dazzling but thats about all there is. The OConnell clan is the only one around lacking supernatural powers which means they are about as relevant to the action as Mike and the Mad Dogs callers are to how the Yankees are doing. ""I hate mummies"" the Hannah character declares. ""They never fight fair"" But the emperor takes it so easy on the mortals that its like hes pitching batting practice to the Pee-Wee League. We know he can hurl fireballs like bullets for instance but instead he lobs them gently behind Ricks back as he sprints away. When he makes dagger-sharp icicles pop out of the ice beneath his enemies feet he doesnt do it where theyre actually standing but off to the side so they can flee as the ice behind them erupts with icicles. Why not make the icicles pop up in front of the OConnells then chuckle softly as they impale themselves? The emperor can only be killed by a magic dagger planted in the heart but instead of hurling it into the deepest chasm he carries it jauntily on his belt so anyone can yank it out and stab him. The dialogue consists entirely of either dim attempts at humor (""The yak yakked"" ""Theres something incredibly romantic about vanquishing the undead"") and useless blabbing like ""Im sorry I blamed you guys for raising the emperor"" and Hannahs shouting ""Avalanche"" At least I think thats what he said; I could barely hear him above the sound of the avalanche. Whats with outsourcing the Mummy franchise to China in the first place? Do the undead work for lower wages there? When I go to a Mummy movie I dont want ninjas and yetis and men turned to stone. I want embalmed corpses and hieroglyphics. I want pharaoh. I want pyramids and sphinxes and Ace bandages. Did ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" take place on the Nile? THE MUMMY TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR Bury it for 2000 years. Running time 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity).

Click pic for a Brendan Fraser photo gallery Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday July 31 2008 333 PM ""Here we go again"" sighs adventurer Rick OConnell in ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" and hes not the only one to notice that things are starting to look awfully familiar.Brendan Fraser whos played OConnell twice before brings his characteristically wry sense of humor to the role. But I could swear I saw him checking his watch once or twice. Actually boredom is the very basis of this sequel at least at the beginning. Its 1946 and OConnell and his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) have reluctantly retired from mummy-chasing. She writes novels based on their past exploits hes taken up fly-fishing and theyre both secretly miserable. So when theyre asked to deliver a rare diamond to China they jump at the chance of adventure. What they find when they arrive is that their son (Luke Ford) has taken up the family business and excavated the tomb of an evil emperor (Jet Li) destroyed by a curse centuries before. The diamond holds the key to awakening the ancient leader who turns out to be pretty annoyed by the interruption. First he calls up his fierce long-dormant army. Then he turns himself into a three-headed dragon. Finally he tries to make his return official by drinking from a legendary fountain of youth. Only the OConnells and the fountains guardian (Michelle Yeoh) can stop him. Always something of an ""Indiana Jones"" knockoff the ""Mummy"" franchise started as an homage to early serial adventures. But director Rob Cohen believes that bigger is always better so instead of an old-fashioned yarn hes spun a very modern web of explosions chases and random CGI monsters. Whats missing amid the mayhem is a sense of personality (and technically any genuine mummies). Bello usually so dependable is disastrously miscast in a role originated by Rachel Weisz. Lis gifts are nearly hidden beneath all the special effects and why hire martial arts goddess Yeoh if youre just going to lock her away in a cave? The best thing about the movie is Fraser who remains likably calm despite the deafening clamor that surrounds him. Still even he seems to realize that its time to let ""The Mummy"" rest in peace. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (PG-13) Curses youll feel stiffed by the rotten filmmaking. Brendan Fraser returns as explorer Rick OConnell. ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"". Photo Frank Masi. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald In a different year The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor might have squeaked by as a pedestrian but serviceable time-killer much like the first two Mummy pictures (or even the spin-off The Scorpion King). But this has been the summer of The Dark Knight and Iron Man and Hellboy II and even Wanted and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This summer even the merely tolerable has a new standard. And Tomb doesnt come close even though it contains a sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh -- which like every other bit of action in the film is chopped and edited to the point of incomprehensibility by director Rob Cohen (Stealth xXx) apparently out to prove Michael Bay is a sissy who just wants his mommy. Tomb is the kind of movie you sit through dreading the expository scenes because the acting is so bad and the dialogue so pointedly written to make sure the little ones in the audience can keep up with the plot (``Hes taking her back to his tomb to raise his army). But then the big action scenes come -- loud chaotic deafening (did I mention loud?) -- and you start longing for another scene in which the typically fine Maria Bello (A History of ViolenceThank You For Smoking) embarrasses herself while playing Evelyn OConnell wife of intrepid archaeologist Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser). Evelyn was originally played by Rachel Weisz who wisely decided two Mummys were enough and passed on the third. Instead of making the character her own Bello tries to mimic Weiszs performance but she cant even get past the English accent. Watching her trying to be charmingly British and sexy is akin to watching Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia without the ABBA songs. Its painful excruciating and whenever the movie requires her to shift into tough action-babe mode ridiculous. Fraser who is capable of much more than he is usually given to do (check out The Quiet American to see how good he really is) is charismatic enough to survive the movie relatively unscathed Like the best actors he refuses to coast even when hes stranded in a lousy movie. You even buy it sort of when hes trading dropkicks with Li. But there are so many characters running around in Tomb Fraser is practically relegated to supporting-man status. Perhaps fearing that the actor who is now 39 (which equals 85 in Hollywood years) may be getting a little long in the tooth to draw in a teen audience screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar cram in a subplot involving his college-age son (Luke Ford) who is just as adept at fighting off special effects as his dad. They bicker like Harrison Ford and Shia LaBeouf did in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but their relationship adds nothing to the movie except a hook to lure in the CW crowd. The script of Tomb is one of those insanely contrived contraptions that falls apart the second you stop to think about it (for example if youre going to curse an evil emperor and immobilize him for all eternity shouldnt you choose a spell that doesnt have a loophole in which he can return and transform into ``the most hideous creatures ever seen?) As the shape-shifting baddie Li spends most of the movie running around under extensive digital makeup which renders his casting pointless since it could be anybody under there. He also at one point turns into a giant three-headed dragon. No really. The loopiest moment in Tomb however comes during a fierce gunfight between the outnumbered heroes and a swarm of baddies. Just when things look bleakest the daughter (Isabella Leong) of an immortal sorceress -- dont ask -- yells out a few abracadabras and in swoops a pack of snarling Yetis to help the good guys. As best as I could tell there are no actual mummies in The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor but it does have abominable snowmen. Thats entertainment.

Explorer Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) races through the catacombs of ancient China in The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Photo FRANK MASI UNIVERSAL STUDIOS The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Some films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind dont divulge too much of themselves in the poster (a frozen lake? Jim Carreys bangs? Huh?). Others tell you everything you need to know and then some. For instance from a recent poster for The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Warrior we surmise that Brendan Fraser returns as Rick OConnell the explorer extraordinaire who smacked down ancient Egyptian terrors in Mummys I and II. We learn that Jet Li co-stars as a warrior in a snit. From the shadowy figures in the background we conclude that hordes of variously decayed skeletons (massing behind Fraser) battle ranks of Chinese terra-cotta soldiers (massing behind Li). From this from the PG-13 rating at the bottom and from the two swords in Frasers hands we can predict a sizeable portion of hyper-pixilated violence. Most of all this poster for Tomb of the Dragon Emperor shows us the mummy. Looming over everything is a crumbling visage of Li in cadaver mode -- his mouth agape his dental work exposed his left cheek shattered against a burning orange sky. This image captures our Main Man Mummy in his signature expression literally exploding in anger which he does whenever someone denies him immortality and his head heats up in a pique of world-conquering irritability. The fire rises to his eyes. Chunks of his face pop off. Sweet. Welcome to the third Mummy which offers a new mummy in a new location but follows the same old plot. Its now 1946 and Imhotep the original undead baddie has been permanently dispatched. Rick and his wife Evie (a faux-English Maria Bello replacing Rachel Weisz) are retired and bored out of their wits at a sprawling English manse. What they dont know is that their idiot son Alex (Luke Ford only 12 years younger than Fraser) has dropped out of college to lead an archaeological dig in distant China. Alex is looking to find disinter and exploit the petrified bod of an ancient emperor (called Han isnt he Qin?) who was cursed by a witch (Michelle Yeoh) after her lover (Russell Wong) was drawn and quartered. Some two millennia later a nasty Chinese general (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang) schemes to rouse the dead emperor (i.e. Li) with a magic elixir encased in a priceless bauble called the Eye of Shangri-La. Coincidence A This very bauble is being carried to Shanghai on a diplomatic mission by Rick and Evie. Coincidence B Evies brother Jonathan (John Hannah reprising his cornball-bumbler routine) runs a nightclub in Shanghai. Coincidence C Idiot son Alex is there too having successfully pillaged the emperors tomb. (""Its only the greatest find since King Tut"" he brags. Idiot.) Soon the four of them are tooling around China with a re-animated dynastic cadaver on their tails finding aid from a mystical beauty (Isabella Leong) and three muscular Yetis at the gate to Shangri-La. Theyre badly animated but its nice to see abominable snowmen portrayed in a positive light for a change. Why go to Shangri-La? For eternal life sure but the main thing is the chance to bond with fellow travelers. While Jonathan cozies up to a yak Alex woos the young lady and sorts issues with his parents. ""Hey Mom. Sorry I blamed you for raising the emperor"" he says which is nice but the idiot never apologizes for digging him up in the first place. May the enchanted powers of cinema prevent him from appearing in Mummy 4. Director Rob Cohen (xXx) takes over from Mummy maestro Stephen Sommers (and Chuck Russell who helmed a 2002 prequel The Scorpion King) with a musclehead simplicity that piles on the cute one-liners and computerized corpse gymnastics. Its serviceable summer twaddle but you might as well see Hellboy II The Golden Army -- similar plot much better film.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED July 30 2008 at 1231 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 1032 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" the third installment in the kin-of-Indy franchise finds the son of explorer Rick OConnell (Brendan Fraser) on his own archaeological dig in China in search of the tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Alex (Luke Ford) is tempting a disaster in digging for him. If the emperor (Jet Li) is revived and his army of terra-cotta warriors called forth well . . . you know the action-fantasy drill. A voice-over introduction shows what a bad guy the emperor was back in the day which was 2000 years ago. Those he conquered he enslaved. Those no longer fit to build his Great Wall he buries beneath it. Only the sorceress Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh) is around back then to thwart his grandest scheme eternal life. While Alex is being set up to awaken mummies his shockingly well-preserved Mummy and Daddy are back at their estate in England. Having retired from the work of previous adventures they seem a bit lost. Hes trying to take up a sport that doesnt require a gun. Shes appearing at book readings with her latest -- and last she fears -- roman a clef about espionage the undead and romance. Still the most pressing question posed by ""The Mummy"" is not how the Dragon Emperor might be vanquished once hes roused from the dead and heads to Shangri-La for a dip in the waters of immortality. Its this How could ""Ricochet"" and Evelyn OConnell (Maria Bello replaces Rachel Weisz in the role) possibly have a college-age son? Its distracting in a basic-math basic-storytelling way. With little makeup to suggest otherwise the two would have been younger than ""Juno"" MacGuff when they had Alex. Since one of the films themes deals with the Oedipal conflicts between Rick and Alex it might be nice to actually believe they are father and son. One can argue that the optimal moviegoer for this PG-13 movie probably believes his 20-something sixth- grade teacher is a senior citizen. It doesnt take much prodding by a government official to have them delivering a precious artifact to Shanghai where Evelyns brother Jonathan (John Hannah) runs a nightclub called the Imhotep. Its a trip that reunites the OConnells for a bickering-bonding adventure. Rob Cohen of ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""XXX"" fame directs. A master of the action set-piece but not always entire flicks he hurtles ""The Mummy"" from one action sequence to another. Its a rhythm thats intended to excite but occasionally bores. There are exceptions. A wild ride through a beautifully sound-stagey Shanghai plays with fireworks to nice effect. An avalanche in the Himalayas fills the screen and there are new beasts to be found. Yet the only surprises come in the final act. They take place in snowy mountains and then on a desert plain as the emperors army clashes with the bony souls of those he oppressed and betrayed. Sadly they are all computer-generated. While plenty of arrows zing few of the wisecracks or familial confessions in Alfred Goughs and Miles Millars script hit their mark. Frasers grimaced delivery suggests he knows something here isnt quite working. A charismatic performer Jet Li doesnt worry much about using his acrobatic fight techniques for hero or villain. Here hes decidedly the latter a leader who cant be trusted to keep his word but can be counted on to pursue absolute power absolutely. What distinguishes one from the other is his smile which is AWOL. Chinese lore and the Chinese martial-arts fantasy films that ""The Mummy"" borrows from often feature strong female characters. Yeohs Zi Yuan is impressively fierce and regally foxy. Bello and Isabella Leong who plays Lin the young woman charged with keeping the emperor dead also give as good as they get. ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" taps into a fond pop-culture memory. For those of us of a certain age it feels like kin to the stuff of Saturday-afternoon TV where Sinbad could be seen battling Ray Harryhausens audacious creatures. Is the ""Mummy"" good? Well were any of those afternoon delights? Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

By Peter Rainer August 2 2008 Save for later Saved Its been reported that the producers of ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" wanted to head the profitable but mediocre franchise in a whole new direction. Turns out they meant Asia. This third ""Mummy"" movie takes us on a guided tour of the catacombs of ancient China and the peaks of the Himalayas with a pit stop in postwar Shanghai. Anyone looking for a terrific summer popcorn movie should not hop on board.Brendan Fraser is once again the intrepid Rick OConnell moviedoms low-rent answer to Indiana Jones. His wife is played by new-to-the-series Maria Bello instead alas of Rachel Weisz. Her sometime British accent appears to trouble her more than the marauding mummies - technically theyre terra-cotta soldiers - who awaken from a 2000-year-old spell cast upon them by a double-crossed sorceress (Michelle Yeoh who must have felt double-crossed by her skimpy screen time).The OConnells are outfitted with a swashbuckling son Alex (Luke Ford) who looks to be about 18. Since Fraser doesnt look a day over 35 this is quite a stretch. This pandering to the youth market made more sense in the latest Indiana Jones movie with its casting of Shia LaBeouf opposite the 60-plus Harrison Ford. Here it just seems freakish. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Even more so is the way director Rob Cohen wastes the considerable talents of the great martial-arts action star Jet Li who plays the resurrected Chinese Emperor - the Mummy of Mummies - and barely gets to throw a single roundhouse punch. Half the time hes just a glorified special effect. Why cast Jet Li and then turn him into a CGI grotesque? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor There is one bit of good news. For all you abominable snowman fans out there ""The Mummy"" is filled with yetis. And boy are they ever angry.

"Third time around Mummy unravels - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Third time around Mummy unravels Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / August 1 2008 ""Do the words Rest in Peace mean anything to you people?"" asks someone during the course of ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" Apparently not. Nine years after the first big-budget action ""Mummy"" and seven years after its follow-up comes this jokey frenetic overproduced three-quel. Despite plenty of post-""Pirates of the Caribbean"" zombie mayhem its strictly for kids. And for Brendan Frasers bank account.The star is just about the only person left from the 1999 original but his dudacious charm is wearing thin as adventurer Rick OConnell once more steps into the breach of the undead. Egypt having been plundered in previous installments the action moves to China where the ancient kill-crazy Emperor Han (Jet Li) has been dug up along with his terra-cotta army.Arrayed against him are Rick his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello takes over for Rachel Weisz wielding a simply teddible British accent) their college-age junior explorer son Alex (Luke Ford) Evelyns nervous-nellie brother Jonathan (John Hannah) a beautiful 2000-year-old witch (Michelle Yeoh) and her daughter (Isabella Leong). Needing to drink from the pool of eternal youth the villain leads them all to Shangri-La high up in the Himalayas.Better they should have looked on the Universal back lot since Fraser and Bello seem ridiculously young to be Fords parents. The scripts limp intergenerational arguments come off as sibling rivalry.Despite exotic locations epic cinematography and much spectacular crash and bang this ""Mummy"" feels like a threadbare toss-off. Director Rob Cohen (""xXx"" ""Stealth"") keeps things moving and thats about it; the script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar stoops to such kiddie-film silliness as an airsick yak and Yetis who kick field goals.Thats right the Abominable Snowman and friends put in an appearance the only time the film threatens to become entertainingly daft. The rest is prodigious big-budget waste expertly crafted and instantly forgettable. The sense of missed opportunity extends to the presence of Jet Li who despite some poorly shot fight scenes mostly stands around snarling in rotting-clay makeup.Why hire one of the great stars of Hong Kong martial arts movies and give him nothing to do? Maybe they can solve that mystery in the next sequel. It should feature Brendan Fraser beating a mummified horse. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

Set in 1947 the new film takes place 24 years after the original 1999 movie and 14 years after we last saw the family in 2001s ""The Mummy Returns."" In other words the OConnells are teetering on the edge of middle age. But of course there wouldnt be a sequel if their tedium went unrelieved. In fitting with the trends of 2008 the couple makes off for China; theyve been charged with returning a precious artifact -- the Eye of Shangri-la -- to its country of origin. Perchance their son Alex (Luke Ford) is now working as an archaeologist in the Shanghai area and has just made a discovery the well-preserved booby-trapped tomb of an ancient Qin Dynasty emperor. Does it go without saying? In so doing Alex awakens yet another mummy. Brendan Fraser reprises his cheeky career-defining role as Rick whereas actress Rachel Weisz was traded for the passable Maria Bello to play whip-smart Evelyn. On the other hand newcomer Ford is far too manly to be a believable son to this still relatively youthful pair though he speaks in the same deep dopey voice as Fraser. The film has its flaws Theres plenty of lame dialogue including a stomach-turning exchange in which archaeological terms such as ""excavation"" are applied to sexually desirable women. And the talents of two exceptional Chinese actors and martial artists Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh go underappreciated. Their fight scenes are filmed close up and cut with great speed so viewers cant quite appreciate their graceful moves. But the special effects are surely satisfying. One action-packed sequence has a pickup truck and an ancient chariot battling it out on Shanghais claustrophobic streets. As OConnell jumps between a stolen truck and one of the mummys terra cotta horses Alex pulls his maneuvers from beneath the chariot -- that is until hes spat out the back like yesterdays trash. Remarkably no one gets hurt. Just when the sophisticated viewer is rolling her eyes director Rob Cohen asserts his sense of humor. The films best quality is that it continues the ""Mummy"" tradition of mocking its own big-budget gratuitousness. Thanks to special effects the film has heroic yetis and a silly yak. Most hilarious of all the mummy is imbued with special regenerative powers Whenever his terra cotta face gets shot off he simply tenses the neck muscles and voila -- a fresh earthen mug.

Lets second that emotion.Rachel Weisz has. After appearing as the archaeologist wife to Brendan Frasers dashing doofus adventurer in the first two tomb-raiding hits the Oscar-winning actress has exited the show to be replaced by Norristowns own Maria Bello - with black hair and a toothy English accent.In The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor Fraser and Bellos Rick and Evelyn OConnell quit their stately manor in Oxfordshire (just down the road from Lara Crofts?) and chase off to China where the two are thrown into director Rob Cohens hodgepodge of period-piece chopsocky.The year is 1947 but the sarcophagus about to be opened houses an evil emperor of 2000 years past and once he - martial arts star Jet Li - gets hold of the magic elixir of eternal life well theres no stopping what he and his dusted off Terra Cotta army can do.Full of exclamatory one-liners ripped from a copy of Indiana Jones for Dummies (""If hes awakened all mortals should despair"") and with the breathless cast spewing putatively witty rejoinders that get drowned out by pows and bangs Mummy 3 should have been kept under wraps. Despite its spiffy production design and cool Ray Harryhausen-inspired special effects - a skeletoid army a trio of abominable snowmen a three-headed gorgon and a scary half-lion/half-dog beast - the movie bogs down in tiresome good guys vs. bad guys action cliches.And every cutaway to Frasers quippy Rick ends with a kerplunk. The square-jawed movie star - now competing against himself in multiplexes with his Jules Verne joy-ride Journey to the Center of the Earth - has turned into a human cartoon. Wide-eyed a forelock dangling over his brow the guy radiates negative charisma. Anyone and everyone in his path turns to stone.Along with Bello the aforementioned Hannah and the demon-eyed Li that path is mightily crowded the classy Michelle Yeoh has her own history with the evil emperor guarding the pool of eternal life; Luke Ford is onboard as Rick and Evelyns grown-up adventurer son; Isabella Leong is the beautiful daughter of Yeohs Zi Yuan and theres a pair of post-World War II Chinese paramilitarists - a sneering growling general and his scar-faced sinisterly sexy sidekick - leading bazooka-equipped troops.Director Rob Cohen tips his baseball cap to the classic Lost Horizon (theres a Himalayan trek leading to Shangri-La) and the same Republic serials that inspired Spielberg and Lucas Indy pics. But Cohen the man behind the cheesily great biopic Dragon The Bruce Lee Story seems to have forgotten how to choreograph and shoot this stuff - the fight scenes with Hong Kong greats Li Yeoh and company are as uninspired as the dialogue.The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  (out of four stars) Directed by Rob Cohen. With Brendan Fraser Jet Li Maria Bello Luke Ford John Hannah Isabella Leong and Michelle Yeoh.

"The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor--1 1/2 stars - Chicago Tribune Arts amp; Entertainment Arts amp; Entertainment The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor--1 1/2 stars Michael PhillipsChicago Tribune critic Privacy Policy Some movies shouldve signed a no-compete clause with themselves. The action beats are more like action beat-downs. One Wow cancels out the last Wow until the Wows start looking more like lowercase wows and soon the wows become merely eh or worse a string of low-grade minimally inventive aggravations that fail even to hit the level of eh. Theyre more like bleh."" The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is bleh though its likely to click with the public given the enormous profitability of the first two in the recent ""Mummy"" cycle. Certainly Brendan Frasers granite-jawed goofily satiric take on a generic serial archetype the tomb-raiding wiseacre didnt hurt. Nor did Rachel Weisz simply showing up and being there pulling laughs out of thin air and reminding everybody else that theres a trick to acting even in a soulless evocation of another era. Its called style. For this third installment in the series Weisz took a powder leaving a role open for the similarly overqualified Maria Bello. Theres a new director this time Rob Cohen who did ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""XXX"" and the underrated Bruce Lee biopic ""Dragon."" ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" alas drags him down to its level though it begins promisingly with a pleasantly outsize prologue setting up the stuff about the ancient horrible warlord ( Jet Li encased in cement or computer-generated fire or digital decomposing-corpse makeup) turned to stone by a 2000-year-old curse. Michelle Yeoh plays the good witch who re-enters the story in 1946 aiding Fraser and Bello and their grown adventurer son played by Luke Ford (meager franchise potential with that one Im afraid). Also we get a trio of abominable snowfolk and the skeletal ghosts of the emperors long-buried slaves revived to fight the emperors stone-no-more army.Cohen has some fine and varied vistas at his disposal thanks to the Chinese location work. But be they back-lot and urban or green-screen and rural the action scenes grind on forever. Neither of the films two credited editors can make much visual sense out of whats happening. Theres a moment when Fraser is playing catch with himself with the special magic ""eye of Shangri-La"" diamond which holds the key to something or other and hes not doing anything a reasonably agile performer couldnt pull off in a single take. Yet the bits hacked up into four or five teeny little shots that wreck the rhythm. Are you telling me a 21st Century audience cant sit still for 7 seconds without a cut? And by the way You kids get offa my lawn The film has one objective to smack its audience in the face with fleeting competing wows over and over. Characters both digitized and human are constantly getting kicked in the head or beheaded. The bone-crunching sound effects are cranked up to the glory-day levels of Sensurround. Except its Sensurround--and KickintheFace--without a breather.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for adventure action violence).Running time 154 Opening 1201 a.m. FridayStarring Brendan Fraser (Rick OConnell); Jet Li (Emperor); Maria Bello (Evelyn OConnell); John Hannah (Jonathan Carnahan); Michelle Yeoh (Zi Yuan)Directed by Rob Cohen; written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar; photographed by Simon Duggan; edited by Joel Negron and Kelly Matsumoto; music by Randy Edelman; production design by Nigel Phelps; produced by Sean Daniel James Jacks Stephen Sommers and Bob Ducsay.

Fraser who at 39 looks perhaps five years older than this kid needed a wholesome offspring-sidekick like a third arm. Then again its not clear that the world needed a third Mummy movie. Director Rob Cohen spends deadening stretches on the backstory as if under the delusion its just as important as the mad creepy-crawlies rising out of the sand. Wrong In a Mummy movie I want my eyes tickled out of their sockets by frenzied digital overkill and couldnt give less of a hoot about the mummys ""motivation."" In this one hes an evil Chinese emperor who rises up in the person of Jet Li as a crumbling oxidized metal ghost whose face keeps chipping off. Fairly cool After an hour of inert exposition a race through Shanghai gooses the movie alive. Then it plunges back into torpor and then at last it offers a desert battle of skeletons and rusty soldiers worthy of the sound and fury and utter meaninglessness we want from an orgy of pixels.

Instead theyre simply great fun Popcorn flicks with razzle-dazzle special effects quirky humor and Brendan Frasers endearing mix of goofiness and machismo. For the first Mummy film in seven years kinetic action director Rob Cohen (XxX The Fast and the Furious) amps up the action and visuals and keeps everything moving at a breathless pace. The result is possibly the most fun Mummy yet - call it The Uber-Mummy. In The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor adventurer Rick OConnell (Fraser) and wife Evelyn (Maria Bello of A History of Violence) have retired to an English country manor in the 1940s. Theyre not ready for rocking chairs just yet. The couple jump at the chance to deliver an ancient diamond to Shanghai. But the priceless jewel is tied into the mystery of the evil Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) who was cursed to spend eternity in suspended animation along with his 10000-strong army. If the emperor wakes from his curse he will have terrifying supernatural powers and seek to take over the world. No surprise when he comes to though the kicky CGI visuals give a great gruesome air to the sequence. The plot is typical Saturday-matinee fare but Cohens flair for action sequences charges everything with fresh thrilling urgency. The movie is filled with bits that are both funny and breathtaking and each one seems to top the moment that precedes it. There is smashing chase between a car and a headless horse in Shanghai on Chinese New Years. Then comes a swooping airplane ride complete with an airsick yak thrown in for laughs. Later comes an attack in the Himalayas in which giant Yetis - simultaneously comic and frightening - come to our heroes rescue. The movies climactic battle is truly awe-inspiring as the emperors army of terra-cotta soldiers does battle with the walking dead. Its trippy and impressive like a Ray Harryhausen film on steroids. Cohen obviously has a lot of fun keeping all of these plates in the air. He even pops up Hitchcock-style during the final sequence in which he appears as a dancer on a nightclub floor. Not everything is smooth sailing however as Cohen seems less self-assured with his cast. Jet Li is wasted as it is hard to tell where the actor ends and the CGI begins. Bello subs for Rachel Weisz who probably thought all this Mummy stuff was beneath her after winning an Oscar. Cohen neatly nudges the audience about the switch in leading ladies ""Im a completely different person"" Evelyn announces during her first appearance on screen but Bello lacks the warmth and humor that Weisz brought to the earlier films. The movie also doesnt say much about a career in Hollywood for guys entering middle age. Fraser appears fit and handsome and still possesses a nice-guy charm that translates well into his role as Rick. But the character is saddled with a college-age son named Alex as if filmmakers were getting ready to put Fraser out to pasture. Occasionally Rick seems marginalized as his dreary offspring gets his own share of heroics. Even worse Fraser is a youthful 39 in real life but the bland actor cast as his son Luke Ford was born in 1981. I can buy dragon emperors that turn into three-headed dragons but I dont believe Fraser as the father of a man in his mid 20s for one minute.

Given the must dust and rust emanating from this third installment its clear the time has come for this ""Mummy"" franchise to be truly mummified once and for all. Set in a post-WWII context and giving the hero a cocky college-age son in a way that tiresomely mirrors the recent ""Indiana Jones"" revival new entry has a fresh marketing angle in the Chinese setting that will boost biz especially in Asia beyond the built-in worldwide audience that paid more than 800 million to see the first two Brendan Fraser starrers. But as the film comes off as both old hat and low-grade this will stand as an interesting test of whether seven years rep too long a wait to sustain public interest in a once-popular concept. Aside from some of the visual effects which at their best involve 10000 Terracotta warriors coming to life after 2000 years this is cheeseball stuff all the way. As they say it starts with the script and this one by ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Smallville"" scribes Alfred Gough and Miles Millar should have been found wanting early on especially in the woeful family-issues dialogue that periodically brings the otherwise lumbering adventure tale to a complete halt. Last seen battling the Rocks Scorpion King in Egypt circa 1933 Frasers Rick OConnell having helped lick the Nazis is reintroduced here in 1946 getting used to domesticity in a sumptuous English mansion while his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello stepping into the role vacated by Rachel Weisz) looks for inspiration for another entry in her potboiler ""Mummy"" novel series. Rick insists hes retired from archeology and exploring but perhaps he doth protest too much as it takes little convincing to get him and Evelyn to decamp for Shanghai where they quickly encounter Evelyns nightclubbing brother (John Hannah returning) and their devil-may-care son Alex (Luke Ford). Alex has inherited his parents heedless sense of derring-do and good luck as he has recently stumbled upon the long-sought tomb of the Dragon Emperor and the chambers housing his massive army all preserved under the Chinese desert. An action-powered prologue reveals how back in 50 B.C. the ruthless nation-unifying Emperor (Jet Li) betrayed a witch (Michelle Yeoh) who had agreed to endow him with immortality and who repaid him by sending him into an unending state of limbo between life and death. With the help of a duplicitous contempo general (of unspecified political affiliation in 1946 China) who hopes to ride the legendary emperors coattails to power the crusty-looking old monarch heads to Shanghai and then to Shangri-La itself -- all the while doing battle in various human and inhuman forms with the OConnell mob which grows to include the witch a foxy mystery woman (Isabella Leong) and an old coot pilot to spirit the gang into the Himalayas. All the elements are present a rare elixir a secret stone the toxic seductions of old Shanghai a villain who can only be killed in one special way the brash and sometimes bumbling Americans the mummy who seethes with centuries of resentment and can morph into other creatures. But reheating the ingredients cant disguise how stale they are as setpiece after setpiece strains to whip up excitement only to fall flat while reminding of previous sequences that did such things ever so much better. Although hes pulled off adrenaline-fueled features before notably ""The Fast and the Furious"" director Rob Cohen flubs his opportunities here by shooting most of the action in medium closeups and cutting with manic arbitrariness. Coverage provides scant sense of geography or proximity between characters while offering no excitement or suspense in the bargain. By any nominal standard for staging screen action its incoherent more often than not. Rather too relaxed in the early going Fraser only intermittently finds his old groove as hes forced to share the spotlight with an overabundance of co-stars; as the lynchpin of the franchise he should have exercised a measure of droit de seigneur by demanding a rewrite giving him more action and better lines. The very contempo-seeming Bello is an odd fit here adopting a high-toned Brit accent and well out of her comfort zone when asked to lurch into battle. Ford as Alex is generally annoying and only further performances by the Aussie newcomer will tell whether the blame lies with the actor or the role. Asian thesps are highly confined by costumes and character conception with Yeoh having the most opportunities as the fortune-dealing witch. Li only really appears in recognizably human form at the beginning and end as the Emperor takes partially mummified CG form through most of the picture. Production values are massive ranging from a large Shanghai-streets soundstage set to more impressively the sandy wastes that serve as the setting for the climactic battle. End credits are truly endless listing everything down to hair department interpreter. If there is to be a fourth ""Mummy"" perish the thought internal indications are that it would be set in Peru.

Photo Jasin Boland Universal Studios Movie review The undead return in The Mummy 1 / 5 Back to Gallery The MummyTomb of the Dragon Emperor Action. Starring Brendan Fraser Jet Li and Maria Bello. Directed by Rob Cohen. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""The Mummy"" series has been dead for a long time but like the mummies it depicts it wont stay buried. Youd think that doing story after story about people who haplessly revive a dead thing only to have things end in disaster might clue somebody in but no. The pursuit of fame and treasure goes on despite the consequences. The new installment ""The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" fails despite being given the best possible chance of success with Rob Cohen in the directors chair. Cohen (""The Fast and the Furious"") is one of the most talented action directors in the business. Hes no hack who just stands there shaking a camera. His action scenes are imaginatively conceived and meticulously edited and choreographed. He doesnt sacrifice clarity for commotion and he also knows how to work with actors. ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" has the most natural acting and is the most human and emotionally inhabited of this recent ""Mummy"" franchise. Yet none of this matters because of the way the action is used - or misused - which brings up a major script problem. Its a problem this movie shares alas with a lot of action movies. The action isnt used to advance the story but to delay it. Audiences want to see things happen. But to an audience ""what happens"" refers to story to stuff happening to the characters to the narrative advancing. Action sequences at their best advance the narrative in an exciting way. Conversely if the audience knows that an action sequence placed as it is wont move the story forward - that it can only be a lot of smartly crafted movement - the audience will become bored. As in real bored. As in climbing the walls. This is what happens with ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" It tells a tiny story. The heroes go one place. Then they go to another place. Then they meet up with the bad guy. Theres a showdown. Soup to nuts this story could have been told in 45 minutes with no trouble. To do it in 60 would have been pushing it. Instead ""Tomb"" stretches this little bonbon of a plot into 112 minutes which means that every minuscule turn has to be inflated with an action sequence - one that most often leaves the characters about where they were when the shooting started. One actor stands out for particular praise however Rachel Weisz for deciding not to make this third ""Mummy"" movie. Shes replaced here by Maria Bello who manages to seem more English than Weisz would have. Since the last installment Evelyn (Bello) in addition to completely changing her look has become an adventure writer and her husband Rick (Brendan Fraser) is teaching. But bored by staid domesticity they jump at an assignment that takes them to China. The pre-credits sequence is the best thing in the movie. It sets up what seems like the beginning of a great yarn about an evil emperor (Jet Li) in ancient China who is cursed by a good witch (Michelle Yeoh). He and his army all of a sudden become mummies which makes them look like the terra-cotta soldiers that toured the worlds museums last year. Maybe thats where somebody got the idea. Of course the emperor wants to make a comeback and of course Rick and Evelyn have to stop him and it doesnt get much more complicated than that. Along the way they make a detour to Shangri-la which is always nice. Actually a little more Shangri-la wouldnt have been bad. They could have at least stayed long enough to see if Sam Jaffe was still there. When Bello played a working-class New Jersey woman in ""World Trade Center"" she had the accent down but not the soul. But in ""Tomb"" she is identifiably a certain kind of bright polished energetic English lady and shes a lot of fun - at least to the extent that she gets to be fun. As for Fraser his clumsy humanity is endearing but by now assuming he has invested wisely he should have enough money saved so as to not have to waste his talent anymore. Even doing dinner theater would be more rewarding than this. -- Advisory The heroes shoot a lot of people and dont think much about it.
