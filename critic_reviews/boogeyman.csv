Director Kay competently delivers the formulaic frights but Barry Watsons log-like lead performance stymies any hope of a deeper undertow. Traumatised at the age of eight by the disappearance of his father the now twentysomething Tim (Watson) returns home for his mothers funeral. Still a closet scaredy-cat Tim believes the Boogeyman is real that he took his father and will one day return to take him. Despite this he decides to spend the night in his mothers spooky old gothic house and confront his fears head-on. Tims creepy scenes with young country girl Franny (Skye McCole Bartusiak) effectively exploit the slippage between Tims distorted imagination and our grasp of solid reality. Then suddenly the entire conceit evaporates and we slide into a Stephen King-style monster movie. Disappointing and daft.

There is a supernaturally speedy killing accomplished with heavy-duty plastic wrap. There is frequent whooshing and rapid camera movement. But among the dozen or so people who attended the 11 a.m. showing of the film yesterday at Loews 84th Street on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (including a couple of teenage boys who arrived in the middle talked loudly changed seats a few times then left) not a single gasp or shriek was heard.Its surprising that it took three people to write the ""Boogeyman"" screenplay since the film is all bare-bones ideas with no fleshing out. Barry Watson of WBs ""7th Heaven"" trying to look as sensitive as Johnny Depp plays the young protagonist Tim a low-level magazine editor who has been afraid of closets since he was 8. That was when his father came into the bedroom to reassure him that there was no such thing as the boogeyman only to be sucked into the closet by something scary and never seen again.Over the Thanksgiving weekend Tim learns that his estranged mother (Lucy Lawless seen mostly in flashbacks and hallucinations) has died. He returns to his hometown for the funeral and takes his old psychiatrists advice he stays in his childhood home overnight to prove to himself that no monsters are after him. ""Theres nothing in there but memories"" the doctor (Robyn Malcolm) says.Well shes wrong. The boogeyman is after Tim and apparently everyone Tim cares about.The filmmakers are smart enough to keep the monster out of sight for a long time and then to show only glimpses but a similar tactic of providing only glimpses of plot and character is disastrous. Moviegoers never learn who or what the boogeyman is what his particular beef with Tim is what his powers are and what has stirred up his wrath after all these years.Tim encounters a sweet but unsmiling child named Franny (Skye McCole Bartusiak) who cant really be there because she vanished as a little girl in 1985. All we ever learn about her is that her father once tried to face down the boogeyman. And what did Tim talk to the psychiatrist about for all those years? Advertisement Continue reading the main story Tim sometimes walks into his bedroom closet and suddenly finds himself in the motel where he and his blond girlfriend Jessica (Tory Mussett) were preparing for an evening of romance. Just as suddenly he finds himself back in the house where a sexy brunet childhood friend Kate (Emily Deschanel sister of Zooey) has brought over some food. Kate is getting a little scared being in that abandoned isolated two-story place by herself. The house is very creaky but then so is the movie.Boogeyman is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes vague sexual references partial nudity some creepy shadows a scary nail gun and sudden movement that might frighten small children.Boogeyman Opens nationwide today.Directed by Stephen Kay; written by Eric Kripke Juliet Snowden and Stiles White based on a story by Mr. Kripke; director of photography Bobby Bukowski; edited by John Axelrad; music by Joseph Loduca; production designer Robert Gillies; produced by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert; released by Screen Gems.
