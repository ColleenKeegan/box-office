(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures/Jonathan Wenk) In this photo provided by Paramount Pictures Kim (Rachel Bilson) and Michael (Zach Braff) struggle to adapt to adulthood in ""The Last Kiss."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures/Jonathan Wenk) Photo JONATHAN WENK Plenty of oats to sow before settling down 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Last Kiss Romantic drama. Starring Zach Braff Jacinda Barrett Rachel Bilson and Blythe Danner. Directed by Tony Goldwyn. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If ""The Last Kiss"" starts to feel awfully familiar at least its not because the movie follows a predictable Hollywood formula. Theres nothing formulaic in this story of four buddies on the cusp of 30 torn between settling down and opening themselves up to more adventures -- particularly of a sexual nature. You may recognize it because its a remake of a delectable Italian film of the same title that played in the Bay Area five years ago. Remarkably little has been lost in translation. Although thoroughly Americanized -- the setting is Madison Wis. -- it still feels European in its concentrated focus on troubled relationships particularly between the angst-ridden Michael (Zach Braff) and his pregnant girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) instead of diverting attention to gimmicks the way Hollywood romances are prone to. The film doesnt judge Michael and his pals; instead it tries to get inside the fear motivating them. Theyre afraid of losing the passion of youth and becoming stuck in a life of utter predictability. They dont always behave admirably. But they do act in ways that are identifiably human which is more than can be said for a lot of screen characters. Screenwriter Paul Haggis deserves full credit for knowing how to fiddle with the original version while maintaining its offbeat charm. Hes made clever adjustments for cultural differences like changing a family business from making religious objects to cheese. Haggis who wrote the Oscar-winning best pictures ""Crash"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" has the best ear for dialogue in the business. The caustic late-night conversations between disgruntled mates sound as if Haggis had placed a tape recorder in random bedrooms and spliced together the best of the bickering. When Michael repeatedly tells Jenna how much he loves her you think he doth profess too much. Sure enough Michaels wandering eye settles on a college student Kim (""The OCs"" Rachel Bilson) he meets at a friends wedding. A siren dressed in red Kim flirts outrageously and Michael flirts back. Braff has the same quality Dustin Hoffman exploited in ""The Graduate"" of looking guilty even when he hasnt done anything. His nervous gestures speak volumes about Michaels genuine confusion. Hes knocked up his girlfriend but feels nowhere near ready to marry her and take on the responsibility of fatherhood. On the other hand he recognizes Jennas steadfast qualities and that Kim is just a passing fancy. Bilson brings a poignant desperation to her desire for Michael. Haggis gives Kim the films most philosophical speech about how contemporary lives are so speeded up that people are having mid-life crises before they hit 30. Its a bit of a cheat. As the part is written Kim gives little indication of having the smarts to string those thoughts together. Jennas mother (Blythe Danner) is going through her mid-life crisis at an age-appropriate time. Shes decided that her husband of 30 years is too unemotional to meet her needs. Danner whos just won back-to-back Emmys is in her second bloom as an actress. Shes eerily calm during a confrontation in the couples bedroom staring into a mirror and methodically rubbing one of those creams that are supposed to erase wrinkles onto her face as she hurls accusations at her perplexed husband. As if emboldened by Haggis script Tony Goldwyn a competent but not especially imaginative director has found interesting visual ways to express the young mens ambivalence about growing up and accepting the responsibilities that come with it. As Michael is telling Jenna yet again how lucky he is to have her he drives by a billboard of a luscious woman forbidden fruit that he will soon find irresistible. Cars are used to represent freedom. When one of Michaels friends comes up with the idea that they should all drive to South America as sort of a last hurrah they go shopping for an RV. The urge to get in the van is palpable as is the urge to kiss unfamiliar lips one more time. ""The Last Kiss"" ponders what you give up -- and what you gain -- from sticking with what youve got. -- Advisory Sexual situations.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In the frustratingly familiar ""The Last Kiss"" Zach Braff and Jacinda Barrett star as Michael and Jenna young not-quite-marrieds on the brink of 30 with a baby on the way. Of his lifelong buddies Michael seems the one most capable of ""from their cradle to your grave"" commitment. His and Jennas relationship has a sexy playful cameraderie. Friend Chris (Casey Affleck) already has an infant. Only the trick of his sons well-being isnt done with mirrors but with the frazzled energy and brewing fury of his wife Lisa. Izzy (Michael Weston) has been dumped and is in a deep slump. Free-spirited Kenny is relaxed in his skin and his hometown. Faster than you can ask ""Why are weddings the scene of so many big-screen meltdowns?"" the story arcs of the four are revealed at a friends nuptials. When his ex shows up Izzy has the sort of tantrum that suggests he needs a change of scenery. Chris gets screamed at by Lisa for playing with their son but not bothering to check his diaper. Kenny hooks up with a woman as supple in bedroom gymnastics as he is. And Michael allows his head to be turned by college coed Kim (Rachel Bilson of ""The OC""). This is not a meeting of equals. ""Crash"" writer-director Paul Haggis adapted Gabriele Muccinos Italian feature film. ""Scrubs"" star Braff made a refreshing big-screen splash two summers ago when he wrote directed and starred in the insightful and often delightful comedy ""Garden State."" You cant be blamed if you expected something richer from the teaming of these talents. Much less ambitious ""The Last Kiss"" goes awry in ways each mans first project could have but so impressively didnt. The flawed characters here are exemplars of a kind of arrested development contrived and privileged. Its hard to feel inclined to support them in their their struggles. ""Garden State"" while a comedy"" sustained a loving seriousness about the way people move toward each other in love and friendship. For all the hurting and hollering ""The Last Kiss"" rarely pushes its emotions from scripted to authentic. Like its predecessor ""The Last Kiss"" has an evocative soundtrack but it never achieves a state of grace and insight. Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner offer glimmers of what might have been. As Jennas parents Anna and Stephen they imbue their roles with a sense of years weathered with love and perhaps ambivalence. ""What would you do if I died"" Anna asks. ""Iron my dark suit"" Stephen replies missing a dangerous shift in his wifes mood. Early in the film Anna stands in a doorway of the bedroom she shares with Stephen. Her hand absently touches then tugs at her neck. Still beautiful she is not as taut as she once was. And though she hates to admit it her daughters youth and ardor have set her yearning. Some of the best acting occurs in gestures. This one gets at fleshs vulnerabilities proving in the right hands glimpses of the arrival at a certain age trump the fitful dramas of coming of age every time.

"Last Kiss commits to low fidelity - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Last Kiss commits to low fidelity By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 15 2006 ``The Last Kiss"" is a seriocomic pity party for 30-year-old men who are terrified of maturity and I suppose itll strike some guys out there as Gods own truth. To others the film may just seem intensely irritating for its unexamined fear of women for its refusal to draw real dramatic blood and for its unholy use of Coldplay songs.Directed by actor-turned-director Tony Goldywn and written by Paul (``Crash"") Haggis ``Kiss"" is a remake of the 2001 Italian film ``LUltimo Bacio"" retooled to an America of sensitive scared males. It very much wants to be ``Garden State"" five years down the line.The hero Michael (Zach Braff) is an architect -- whats with all the architects in movies lately? -- who has just learned his longtime girlfriend Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) is pregnant. This news fills him with delight when hes talking to Jenna and deer-in-headlights panic at all other times. So hes open to the flirty invitations of a nubile college student named Kim (Rachel Bilson of ``The O.C."") he meets at a wedding. What she sees in him is never quite clear; Braff so sharp on TVs ``Scrubs"" rarely leaves sad-sack mode here.His friends are in similar arrested pickles. Co-worker Chris (Casey Affleck very good) is married with a baby son but his wife (Lauren Lee Smith) is driving him crazy with demands that he change a diaper or two. Izzy (Michael Weston) has been dumped by his girlfriend (Marley Shelton) and is contemplating turning stalker or fleeing the country. The only one of the gang who has it all -- looks hair the continued ability to enjoy casual sex with gorgeous women -- is Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) and he shies like a filly from the first sign of commitment.The central drama is whether Michael will sleep with the absurdly available Kim and more important whether hell be able to tell Jenna about all the not-nice stuff banging around in his head. In other words whether hell stop lying to her. Being a Hollywood movie with TV stars though ``The Last Kiss"" wants us to like these boys even when theyre behaving badly and that keeps it from any real insights into why men can be jerks.And they can be jerks The arrival of marriage babies and ones 30s is certainly the occasion for tortuous self-examination. (Its called growing up fellas and once upon a time before the culture started insisting our youths can go on forever it took place in your 20s or even earlier.) And yes many of us edit our thoughts before they reach the ears of our loved ones for reasons of both tact and anxiety. These things do resonate.Yet for all the toes stepped on and trusts betrayed in ``The Last Kiss"" theres never any lasting damage. Haggis s script has the same airless predetermination that haunted ``Crash"" -- the same cramped democracy of character that keeps it from breathing the air of life as its actually lived. (The writer loves emotional messes so long as theyre tidy.)In the end its the characters who are betrayed particularly the women. Chris s wife is an exhausted shrew end of story. The college girls a siren then a clinger. Jenna is smotheringly affectionate until she becomes a hellhound of fury. What about their fears? ``The Last Kiss"" pays them lip service but its never really interested. Whatever you say honey.That leaves poor Blythe Danner up a tree as Anna Jennas mother a vibrant woman in a rage at her husband (Tom Wilkinson) for being a dull saint. Danner makes the characters righteous anger marvelous and moving to behold; she wants to tear down her suburban stronghold and to hell with the consequences. You wish the movie were about her. It isnt though. Its about forgiving the boys.And about pop songs in place of earned emotion. Is this where Simon and Garfunkel on the soundtrack of ``The Graduate"" have led us? To wall-to-wall Snow Patrol and Aimee Mann cueing us to sigh in canned understanding? As with ``Garden State"" and ``Elizabethtown"" ``The Last Kiss"" is an iPod playlist in search of a movie and what it loses in honest drama it will surely make up for in sales of the CD.Fine but Tony Goldwyn was able to combine period pop and hard human quandaries in 1999s ``A Walk on the Moon"" his first film as director and still his best.

Reps of three generations in contempo Madison Wis. grapple with commitment infidelity hot tempers and cold feet in ""The Last Kiss."" Nicely thesped and adequately involving narrative tackles issues well worth examining in a manner accessible to everyone. But the closest most of the protags get to genuine chemistry is when in proximity to a science building on campus. All-American adaptation by Paul Haggis of Gabriele Muccinos 2001 Italian hit ""LUltimo bacio"" is chummy consensual and always watchable in Tony Goldwyns polished rendition of emotional messiness. Pic should smooch with acceptable B.O. results. Yank version hews closely to the Italian template but trades the sprightly originals frantic pace for a rhythm better suited to Zach Braffs lowkey brand of existential panic. Voiceover from Michael (Braff) reveals he will hit 30 next month. While having dinner with Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) his girlfriend of three years and her parents Anna (Blythe Danner) and Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) Jenna announces shes 10 weeks pregnant. Unsettled by the prospect of settling down and raising a child -- not to mention spending less time with his three childhood buddies -- Michael an architect boasts the demeanor of a human deer caught in the headlights of imminent adulthood. When perky college sophomore Kim (Rachel Bilson) gloms on to Michael offering sex and adoration in record time Michael flirts with disaster and all hell breaks loose. Michaels pals face crises and obstacles of their own with the sometimes lopsided ensembler contriving to dole out at least one Big Issue per customer. Izzy (Michael Weston) cant take another minute in the cheese biz and weepy and volatile refuses to accept that his childhood sweetheart has left him. Chris (Casey Affleck) and wife Lisa (Lauren Lee Smith) thought having a baby might save their relationship but the arrival of their son has only accentuated their problems. Slacker Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) tends bar and beds babes; when he meets Danielle (Cindy Sampson) his ideal match in female form he bolts. Braff is always fun to watch and Danner and Wilkinson can do no wrong. Situational humor is structurally sound and yet the aggregate result of all this Sturm und Drang is more distancing than involving. The convincingly flawed characters make more dumb moves than smart ones but it rarely feels as if the psyches on display are really on the line. Result makes for more of a cautionary tale than a rollicking entertainment although there are multiple laughs along the way. Tweaks and adjustments from the original include turning the Kim character from an 18-year-old who lives with her parents to a 20-year-old with a dorm room and eliminating the Izzy characters relationship with his ailing father. Haggis has sharply embellished a crucial dialogue scene between Braffs and Wilkinsons characters to excellent effect. A revelation and advice from an older man to a younger one leads to a rewardingly intense reshuffling of events en route to an open ending of a sort not often seen in mainstream American films. Lensing is efficient score unobtrusive. The Last KissProductionA DreamWorks release of a Lakeshore Entertainment and DreamWorks Pictures presentation of a Lakeshore Entertainment production.

"Last Kiss The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-kiss-the ) Last Kiss The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli I recommend The Last Kiss but not without a misgiving or two. This movie is essentially a celebration of yuppie angst. Its about people in their late 20s who have issues with commitment and monogamy who have lost their way and are trying to find themselves. Essentially its about middle age crises for people who are only a little more than half-way to middle age. The protagonist is obnoxiously self-centered yet we are supposed to sympathize with him and (at least based on the ending) forgive him for some of the crass things he does. Nevertheless I liked The Last Kiss because no matter how self-absorbed some of the characters are they are three-dimensional. People will identify with them. Not all the stories have tidy endings. And theres some wonderful dialogue to go along with the exceptional performances. This is one of those movies where youre willing to overlook the flaws in order to appreciate whats worth lauding. The Last Kiss opens with an announcement Michael (Zach Braff) and his live-in girlfriend of three years Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) are going to have a baby. Marriage however is still not in the cards. Michael is terrified - hes not ready to commit to a long-term relationship with Jenna and now he has the guillotine of fatherhood hanging over his neck. He feels trapped. Enter Kim (Rachel Bilson) a college junior he meets at a wedding. Shes sweet young pretty and completely into Michael. He knows where the road leads but he follows it anyway. Jenna finds out as is always the case in movies like this and her reaction is predictable. Meanwhile Jennas parents are going through their own crisis. Anna (Blythe Danner) fed up by the apparent indifference of her husband Stephen (Tom Wilkinson) confesses an affair and moves out. At the same time Michaels friends Chris (Casey Affleck) and Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) are going through relationship problems of their own. Zach Braff is a reactive actor. His performance style works best when he responds to the actions of others. This is fine for someone in a supporting role but typically not great for a lead. In The Last Kiss Braff is top-billed but the films saving grace is that it features three tremendous supporting performances. Jacinda Barrett is heartbreakingly real as Jenna - neurotic jealous angry hurt but still desperately in love with the father of her unborn baby who as it turns out is really just a kid in an adults body. As Jennas parents Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner bring dignity and humanity to every scene in which they appear. The drawback is that theres not enough of them. A little too much time is spent on the half-developed stories of a few of Michaels buddies. Although the tone lacks the levity of Trust the Man there are narrative and thematic similarities. The absence of overt jokiness allows us to approach the circumstances of the characters in The Last Kiss with a greater degree of seriousness. On a grand scale their problems may be shallow but to these individuals they are earth-shattering. The films goal is to present Michael as a weak rootless man who must grow and learn a few hard lessons. In the end however The Last Kiss takes the easy way out which makes it harder to feel for Michael. Has he suffered enough for all the pain he has caused? Paul Haggis screenplay is based on a 2001 Italian film named Lultmo bacio which I havent seen. Like Crash The Last Kiss seems more interested with cramming as many characters and situations into a reasonable running length than spending the time to delve beneath the surface. Michael and Jennas story excepted its a case of breadth over depth. We get marriage troubles for the older couple Chris post-natal incompatibility with his wife Kennys fear of a relationship that transcends the casual stage and Kims juvenile infatuation with an older man (consider the ""gift"" she presents him with). It seems that for every miss theres an equal - if not stronger - hit. Haggis dialogue is virtually without clunkers and it is delivered with the appropriate weight by a solid cast. Braffs limp performance is countered by Barretts emotional riveting one (although hes in more scenes than she is). The situations are interesting because the characters are real. Tony Goldwyns direction is sure-handed and the eclectic soundtrack will get many movie-goers surfing I-Tunes. For its core demographic The Last Kiss has something to say although its fair to question how profound its words of wisdom are.
