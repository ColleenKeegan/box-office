(HO/REUTERS) BY Jami Bernard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday October 15 2015 1115 AM (Originally published by the Daily News on October 15 1999.) Oh for the time when men were men and were encouraged to beat the tar out of one another. Thats the world ""Fight Club"" pines for. In this brutal smirky film about the self-loathing that comes with emasculation the antidote to a life without manly feelings is to get together in a dingy basement for cathartic punchouts. The more blood spilled teeth spat and bones crunched the happier the members feel the next day by the water cooler. FIGHT CLUB TAKES BEATING FOR ITS HYPER-VIOLENCE IN 1999 Rule 1 of Fight Club You dont talk about it. Rule 2 You dont talk about it. Ah but rules were made to be broken - why else rebel against corporate soullessness? - and word gets out. Fight Club makes new men of those who previously found comparable consolation only in other peoples misery. Edward Norton plays an auto insurance investigator whose life is so banal that ordering in furniture from Ikea is his biggest thrill. He cant sleep. He feels nothing. Nortons character listed in the credits only as the Narrator of the story finds solace in support groups for addicts and cancer patients. Tellingly his favorite group is the one for testicular cancer. He has only lost metaphorically what the other men in his group have lost literally but the weekly hugfests move him. New York Daily News Fight Club movie review (New York Daily News) New York Daily News Fight Club movie review (New York Daily News) Two opposing forces enter the Narrators life and for much of the movie its hard to tell which is more destructive. Theres raccoon-eyed Helena Bonham Carter as a fellow support-group junkie whos cramping the Narrators style. And theres devilish soap salesman Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) an anarchic visionary who pulls the Narrator into his sadistic world of Fight Club chemical burns and outrageous acts against society. One can only hope that Norton and Pitt received ointment stipends. They fight with all comers but most of their fights are with each other an endless pummeling that must have provided a challenge to the Foley artists in terms of varying the soundtrack. You can plunge a knife into a grapefruit only so many times for effect. ""Fight Club"" is grueling and bleak but not unintelligent. Its loathing of the 9-to-5 life wont meet much resistance. There are those who will deplore it for its violence although its hardly groundbreaking just because everyones face gets pulpy. And there are those who will embrace it for the wrong reasons thinking its a daring indictment of society. Like ""The Sixth Sense"" ""Fight Club"" resorts to a ""trick"" ending that sends a final left hook of new information your way. It requires you to backtrack over the whole film restitching your perceptions - never mind that this opens all sorts of new plot holes like tears in the skin. But because the market is ripe for such endings plenty of viewers will endure the grime for the final payoff.

Lets also say the symptoms of that condition include near terminal insomnia and an unsatisfiable urge for catalog shopping. Might you not then join a support group for the victims of TB or testicular cancer just so you could hug sob and generally surface some feelings even if you dont actually have one of those diseases? If your answer to that question is ""Are you kidding?"" then Fight Club is not for you though it must be said that early on it funnily realizes the satirical possibilities of 12-stepping your way through life. The film remains strong when Edward Nortons Narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an airplane. Hes everything Norton isnt--a bruising truth teller with a taste for urban anarchism. Hes the kind of guy who splices pornographic flash cuts into family movies when he works as a projectionist who pees in the soup when he works as a banquet waiter. His big idea is well yes a fight club--a basement he commandeers where ordinary guys can come and beat the crap out of each other in bare-knuckle no-holds-barred combat. This really puts them in touch with their feelings which are incoherently rageful. It also puts viewers in touch with director David Finchers preferred mise-en-scene which is almost always dark and more important damp--with rusty water gushing blood and other bodily fluids of less determinable origins. Its definitely a style--see his Seven of a few years ago--and it enforces the contrast between the sterilities of his characters aboveground life and their underground one. Water even when its polluted is the source of life; blood even when its carelessly spilled is the symbol of life being fully lived. To put his point simply its better to be wet than dry. Before long Tyler has a chain of fight clubs up and running all over the country and is molding their members into a paramilitary organization that aims finally to blow up all the credit-card companies and just for good measure TRW. It is along about here that Fight Club which is Jim Uhls adaptation of Chuck Palahniuks novel lurches from satire into fantasy. For we begin to realize that the hunky Pitt is the willowy Nortons doppelganger a projection of fantasies about masculine mastery. The movie manages this smoothly enough--both actors are excellent--but theres something conventionally gimmicky about the way it plays its reality/unreality game--of a lazy piece with its failure to do anything interesting with the woman in the story Helena Bonham Carters neurotically gnarly representation of feminisms failures to create a more sympathetic female. Yet whatever its flaws--and they will for some include its brutal off-putting imagery--Fight Club cant be ignored. It is working American Beauty-Susan Faludi territory that illiberal impious inarticulate fringe that threatens the smug American center with an anger that cannot explain itself can act out its frustrations only in inexplicable violence.

Men should go mano-a-mano bare-knuckled and vent all the rage they want to act out against their absent fathers. In the process they will baptize themselves in the river of their own blood sweat and testosterone. Thus angry white boys will unite be reborn as men and their subterranean brotherhood will gang up first to subvert and then to destroy a culture it rejects.The surrealistic result is a story of physical psychic and social breakdown something like Susan Faludis Stiffed The Betrayal of the American Man as narrated by the Unabomer.Actually Fight Club is narrated by Edward Norton in a performance that burns like lye on flesh. The caustic rant and gimlet eyes emanating from his bruised skull of a face have an incantatory hypnotic effect. It is a performance to which attention will be paid and deservedly so.As the narrator proceeds from a life defined and designed by Ikea to one ignited by the id he rocks not only his own foundations but those of society around him.And as seen through the eyes of Fincher whose camera gets inside the narrator and his milieu as a neurosurgeon gets inside ganglia this is as spectacular as fireworks and as unnerving as a mental meltdown. Youre not sure whether to commit Fincher or commend him.His film charged with an electrifying score by the Dust Brothers opens moments before Doomsday. Our Narrator is unable to speak because a gun barrel is shoved down his throat. Holding the gun is the narrators friend enemy and alter ego Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) natural man practicing what he preaches. What Tyler preaches Theres nothing like the threat of death to provoke a ""near-life"" experience.In fractured flashbacks we learn about the Narrators meaningless life as a recall-campaign coordinator. Thats the guy who has to conduct a cost analysis to figure whether it will cost more to recall faultily built cars than to settle liability lawsuits.So fried is he from reducing life-and-death matters to algebraic formulas that the only way he can feel anything approaching emotion is by habitually attending support groups for those living with various forms of cancer. When people think youre dying they really listen to you the Narrator hears himself saying to another self-help junkie and tourist Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter looking like a Kabuki rag doll).The Narrator who suffers from chronic sleeplessness is as repulsed by needy Marla with her skim-milk skin and her black-licorice hair as he is attracted to self-sufficient Tyler whose sunbeam charisma attracts everyone. Meeting Tyler and organizing fight clubs in which the men channel their long-suppressed rage at everything makes the Narrator feel awake and engaged.What ensues is the least equilateral of triangles with Marla in love with the Narrator whos in love with Tyler whos in love with Marla. But except for one sequence involving Marla and Tyler in flagrante the sexuality hetero- and homo- is purely latent. The violence in all its visceral gore and glory is blatant.Understand that while the violence in Fight Club is allegorical and therefore not exactly gratuitous the film is very very graphic. Likewise the profane poetry of Palahniuks language as condensed by screenwriter Jim Uhls. So know that except insofar as it has something to offend everyone Fight Club is not a movie for everyone.Three factors elevate Finchers apocalyptic stew to something approaching art. First is Nortons performance as sneaky and shocking as that in his film debut Primal Fear. Second is Palahniuks story which dances on a razors edge between life and death expression and repression ecstasy and agony. Third is Finchers dedication to making a film that looks and sound likes no other one that powerfully illustrates what dementia looks like from inside and out.Although its ending subverts what has come before even more aggressively than the Narrator and Tyler want to subvert society Fight Club is a knockout.FIGHT CLUB    Produced by Art Linson Cean Chaffin and Ross Grayson Bell; directed by David Fincher;written by Jim Uhls based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk; photography by Jeff Cronenweth; music by the Dust Brothers; distributed by 20th Century Fox.Running time 2 hours 19 mins.Tyler Durden........Brad PittNarrator............Edward NortonMarla Singer........Helena Bonham CarterRobert Paulsen......Meat Loaf AdayAngel Face..........Jared LetoParents guide R (extreme violence nudity sex drugs)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Comments (1) Fight Club Recommended Watch on Amazon Rated R  139 minutes  1999 This exercise in mainstream masochism macho posturing and designer-grunge fascism (1999) is borderline ridiculous. But it also happens to be David Finchers richest movie--not only because it combines the others (Alien 3 Seven The Game) with chunks of Performance but also because it keeps topping its own giddy excesses. Adapted by Jim Uhls from Chuck Palahniuks novel this has something--but only something--to do with a bored Edward Norton encountering a nihilistic doppelganger (Brad Pitt) who teaches him that getting your brains bashed out is fun. Though youre barely allowed to disagree with him your jaw is supposed to drop with admiring disbelief at the provocation and the overall impression of complexity might easily be mistaken for the genuine article. In other words this is American self-absorption at its finest. With Helena Bonham Carter Meat Loaf and Jared Leto.

On one hand the Fox 2000 feature is the perfect reflection of the millennium malaise that pits pervasive nihilism against an urgent need for something to grasp onto; on the other it caps off a period in which the media and Washington have never been so assiduous in pointing the finger at Hollywood over the impact of screen violence on society and on youth in particular. Rarely has a film been so keyed into its time -- in ways that commercially will be both advantageous and damaging -- as ""Fight Club."" On one hand the Fox 2000 feature is the perfect reflection of the millennium malaise that pits pervasive nihilism against an urgent need for something to grasp onto; on the other it caps off a period in which the media and Washington have never been so assiduous in pointing the finger at Hollywood over the impact of screen violence on society and on youth in particular. But despite certain hostility from some sectors especially in the U.S. this bold inventive sustained adrenaline rush of a movie about a guru who advocates brutality and mayhem should excite and exhilarate young audiences everywhere in significant numbers. From ""Alien3"" through ""Seven"" and ""The Game"" David Fincher has always been attracted to dark material. In Chuck Palahniuks novel of the same name about a cult of men who channel their pent-up physical aggression into increasingly destructive pursuits the director has found his most disturbing subject matter yet. And in debuting screenwriter Jim Uhls clever savagely witty script and the unremitting volley of information it launches Fincher has found the perfect countermeasures to balance his coldly atmospheric often distancing style. The position on violence here can be read on a number of levels. Somewhat controversially in light of the post-Littleton Colo. debate ""Fight Club"" plays mischievously with film conventions almost winking at the audience to convey the characters awareness of being part of a movie that deals in hot-button issues. This rather audaciously gives the impression of a film throwing the responsibility for violence back onto society and refusing to accept blame. Set in an unidentified semi-stylized city the storys nameless narrator (Edward Norton) is introduced with a gun in his mouth before backing up six months to recap his troubles with insomnia. Refusing to treat him a doctor instructs him instead to sit in on a testicular cancer victims group to put his own pain in perspective. He quickly becomes addicted to support groups for a range of terminal illnesses freely weeping and embracing his ""fellow"" sufferers as a means to find the release he needs to sleep. But the arrival of another tourist Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) makes him uncomfortable with his dishonesty. Her blithe admission that the support groups are ""cheaper than a movie and theres free coffee"" is one of many instances in which pitch-black corrosive humor touches subjects that will make many audiences blanch with indignation. Around this time he meets enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who makes and sells soap for a living while moonlighting as a projectionist splicing pornographic images into family films and as a waiter sabotaging meals. When the narrators apartment and all his diligently accumulated material possessions are destroyed in a freak explosion he calls Tyler for a place to stay. They meet at a bar and get tanked together after which Tyler amicably picks a fight that seals their bond and marks the beginning of a phenomenon that each week attracts new participants. The narrator moves into the dilapidated mansion in a toxic waste area that Tyler calls home routinely continuing his job all week as an auto safety checker but waiting for the charge that comes with fighting each Saturday night in a club whose members are sworn to secrecy. A persuasive speaker who encourages a lost generation of men to access pain as a remedy for contemporary despair and numbness Tylers following quickly grows. Fight club chapters start springing up across the country and when Tyler begins assigning homework the members take their aggressive behavior into the outside world with acts of violence vandalism and subversiveness. His disciples start turning up at the house to enlist in an army for Project Mayhem the full extent of which is only gradually revealed. The narrators feelings veer from rejection and abandonment after Tylers sudden disappearance to moral revulsion as he sets out to stop a dramatic chain of events and is brought face to face with discoveries regarding his true nature that provide the storys big twist. Uhls stimulating screenplay explores its existential themes articulately and accessibly unleashing a steady stream of humor razor-sharp dialogue droll popular culture references and wry comments on consumerism corporate culture and capitalism. These qualities serve to temper the storys brutality though many no doubt will still find it repellent. The film also contains pronounced homoerotic undercurrents. These are present both on a surface level in the many toned bodies and especially in the way Pitt is costumed and less superficially in themes of self-love in the narrators magnetic attraction to Tyler his almost jealous resentment first over Marla who invades their home and Tylers bed and later over the legions of followers that compromise his 2IC status causing him to retaliate by destroying the beauty of an angel-faced blond (Jared Leto). Performances by the three leads are uniformly potent with Nortons character demanding by far the greatest range. His journey from trying to create an ordered middle-class universe furnished by Ikea and clothed by DKNY CK and A/X to throwing it all in and finding meaning only in violence represents an uncommonly challenging attack from a major studio film on contemporary values and suppressed instincts. Alert and edgy Norton guides the narrator from the deadening awareness that his life is ending a minute at a time through the invigorating rush that comes when he embraces his dark side and destructive urges to the ultimate confrontation with his own responsibility for the out-of-control spiral of events. In one especially remarkable scene the actor literally pummels himself into a bloody mess before his stunned boss. Pitt is cool charismatic and more dynamically physical perhaps than he has been since his breakthrough role in ""Thelma and Louise"" while Bonham Carter outfitted like a gothic prom queen and spouting acerbic maxims with attitude to burn demolishes any residue of her buttoned-up Merchant-Ivory image in a tough sharp-edged turn. In a film that requires the viewer to keep absorbing information for most of its two-hours-plus duration Fincher never loosens his grip on the material with editor James Haygood contributing to establish a driving pace. As always with the directors work visual aspects are consistently impressive from Alex McDowells richly elaborate at times a little too slick production design to the drained often greenish or jaundiced tones of d.p. Jeff Cronenweths extremely mobile widescreen lensing which includes several knockout sequences in which the camera careens through skin tissue electrical circuitry or bomb wiring. Also notable are the complex sound design and dreamy techno score by the Dust Brothers (Michael Simpson John King).

Starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Directed by David Fincher. (R. 120 minutes.) The name of the movie is ""Fight Club."" Its got bareknuckle fights in it. Theyre violent. Theyre bloody. Please dont watch it and then whine about how violent and bloody it is. Sex and violence are two of the things people go to movies for. They arent getting enough in their own lives. Thats certainly the case with the anonymous narrator of ""Fight Club"" a cynical white- collar insomniac fantasist played by Edward Norton who finds everything he is not in Brad Pitt. Pitt plays Tyler Durden the completely confident inventor of the macho basement slugfest called Fight Club and the author of a personal code that has the appeal of a cult. But his strange nocturnal existence as a movie projectionist and banquet waiter is one hint that Tyler is not all he seems to be. ""Fight Club"" delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational. It is also grimly funny. The mordant script by Jim Uhls a crystalliza tion of the Chuck Palahniuk novel may be too good. Norton delivers so many unadulterated trenchant observations that the narration almost becomes overloaded. The closest we come to learning the narrators name is the tags he wears to the various meetings he obsessively attends to cure his insomnia. The names change from meeting to meeting for those with afflictions ranging from brain parasites to testicular cancer. Nortons testicular cancer has to do with a lack of -- whats the polite word? -- fortitude as he wearily goes about his job as an automobile recall investigator and hopes the plane thats carrying him from place to place will blow up. His cynical view of the world is the next thing to self-loathing. When the dazzling Tyler shows up in the airplane seat next to his he has found something better than a soul mate; he has found an alter ego. Pitt is the epitome of sleazy chic right down to trousers worn at the pubic-hair line but the pieces dont quite fit together. The hyper-intense look of the film derives from the narrators skewed point of view and it is a tour de force of art direction the peeling- apart house where Tyler lives the cityscape in the explosive last scene the seedy lowlife bar where Tyler and his new buddy hatch Fight Club and the inky basements where the face-pummeling bouts occur. Dont sell this film short especially its power on a visceral level. The fights range from Nortons first hesitant then enthusiastic blow to Pitts face outside the bar to elaborately staged bouts slugged out in the gritty darkness of borrowed basements. The most amazing one of all may be Nortons solo self-inflicted beating before the astonished eyes of his boss. Hes not the only one whos astonished. So are we. ..

Sucker Punch - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Fight Club Sucker PunchMOVIES - MOVIE REVIEWIts Hipness And Slickness Notwithstanding `Fight Club Knocks You Out - With EmptinessOctober 15 1999|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie Critic`You do not talk about Fight Club.That is both the first and second rule for members of the fight club called Fight Club in Fight Club. These rules are so important that I am tempted to say nothing more about the club or the film.The problem is that if I dont a lot of people are going to get hurt.I am thinking about the people who will be lured into this movie (which opens today) by the hype and by its hip accomplished cast. Thats a cast that includes heartthrob Brad Pitt the tony Helena Bonham Carter (The Wings of the Dove) and as the narrator of our story the versatile Edward Norton.Norton plays a 30-year-old ``recall coordinator who works for a major automobile company assessing the advisability of product recalls.But one fateful day our narrator encounters a mysterious soap salesman named Tyler Durden and together they invent Fight Club. This Saturday-evening group is composed of men who meet secretly strip to the waist and then beat the living pulp out of each other.Director David Fincher (Seven The Game) and first-time screenwriter Jim Uhls could have called this film Saturday Night Fighters. And for about the first hour of this two-hour 19-minute production I kept thinking that the fights must be a metaphor for something else.Sex. Drugs. Rock n roll. Sports. Something.At last I realized that its fighting as a form of salvation.But salvation from what? From our freeze-dried blow-dried conspicuous-consumption culture of course.``This is so [expletive) stupid our hero complains the first time that Durden suggests that he hit him. And you know hes absolutely right about that.Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk Fight Club is an empty shout of ``To hell with it all - paint-by-numbers nihilism you might say.Really its just frat-boy mischief carried to ludicrous extremes. Yet it takes itself very seriously - in a cool hip not-that-anything-really-matters way of course.Id call the moviemakers smug except that the word suggests that theyre overly pleased with themselves. And these guys dont seem particularly pleased with anyone.Director Fincher does however know how to make a slick movie. His diabolically deft editing and ingenious use of seductively smooth surfaces help keep the films energy up.That cast I mentioned is also a plus.Norton is so intense that I was sometimes interested in what was happening for his sake if for no other reason. And Pitt as a sort of incarnation of the films mean spirit also makes a strong impression.Carter - as the wild chain-smoking woman in these mens lives - doesnt have much to do except to sound tough and confused and borderline-crazy most of the time. At least she does all this with conviction. Meat Loaf meanwhile has a small supporting role as a body builder with testicular cancer and large feminine breasts. (Dont ask.)Like Finchers The Game Fight Club contains a trick ending. And if this ending isnt as easy to guess as the ending of The Game was its not an especially enlightening trick ending either.The best I can say for this ending in fact is that it manages to explain a few things by patching up a hole or two in the plot.But then I have probably said too much about Fight Club already.Like Fight Club The Minus Man takes a good long look at a lost lost soul. But instead of embracing the characters darkness writer-director Hampton Fancher stands apart from him - watching with a cold even stare.Owen Wilson (Armageddon The Haunting) plays Vann Siegert a tall blond boyish drifter with the endearing look of a timid kitten. The gentle Vann would be every preadolescent girls idea of a dream date were it not for the inconvenient fact that he happens to be a serial killer.Its his very sweetness in fact that draws his victims close enough for him to strike at them - that and a certain blankness that people fill with their own fantasies.Vann is certainly ``minus something.The film too has a pleasant slightly blank surface. Set in a small Pacific Coast town The Minus Man is quiet contemplative moody.By avoiding graphic violence Fancher (co-writer of Blade Runner) draws you further into Vanns dark world than you might otherwise be willing to travel. And if Wilson doesnt quite have the wild eyes of dementia there is something of the young Dennis Hopper in his appearance.Based on a novel by Lew McCreary the movie boasts a fine quirky supporting cast that includes Janeane Garofalo as a lonely postal employee who takes a shine to Vann Mercedes Ruehl as his unhappy landlady and Brian Cox as her tormented husband. Singers Sheryl Crow and Dwight Yoakam put in appearances.Although the themes of Fight Club and The Minus Man are similar and although each is narrated by its central character there is a vast difference between them.The former only plays at desolation tossing it from hand to hand like a toy. The latter however is quite beyond such games.In The Minus Man the desolation goes so unspeakably deep that it can only be grasped indirectly.

"Fight Club | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; fight-club ) Fight Club (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli With its kinetic style visceral approach compelling storyline and powerful social message Fight Club makes a commanding case to be considered the 90s version of A Clockwork Orange. In a time when so few motion pictures leave an impact Fight Club refuses to be ignored or dismissed. The experience lingers demanding to be pondered and considered and unlike 95% of modern-day thrillers there is a great deal here to think about and argue over. Fight Club presents an overload of thought-provoking material that works on so many levels as to offer grist for the mills of thousands of reviews feature articles and post-screening conversations. Pre-release interest in Fight Club was understandably high primarily because of those involved with the project. Jim Uhls script is based on an influential novel by Chuck Palahniuk (a book that while not required material in schools has consumed the free time of countless readers). The lead actor is the ever-popular Brad Pitt who makes his strongest bid to date to shed his pretty boy image and don the mantle of a serious thespian. Those dubious about Pitts ability to pull this off in the wake of his recent attempts in Seven Years in Tibet (which is briefly referenced as an in-joke during Fight Club) and Meet Joe Black will suffer a change of heart after seeing this film. Pitts male co-star Edward Norton is widely recognized as one of the most intelligent and versatile performers of his generation. And Fight Clubs director David Fincher has already made a huge artistic impression on movie-goers with only three features to his credit Alien 3 Seven (starring Pitt) and The Game. Mix these elements together in Foxs publicity blender and Fight Club will not carry the title of ""Best Movie of 1999 That No One Saw."" The film begins by introducing us to our narrator Jack who is brilliantly portrayed by Norton. A chameleon of an actor Norton seems perfectly suited to every role he plays whether its the seemingly-wronged defendant in Primal Fear or the white supremacist in American History X. Here the actor flows fluidly into the part of a cynical but mild-mannered employee of a major automobile manufacturer who is suffering from a bout of insomnia. When he visits his doctor for a remedy the disinterested physician tells him to stop whining and visit a support group for testicular cancer survivors if he wants to meet people who really have problems. So Jack does exactly that - and discovers that interacting with these victims gives him an emotional release that allows him to sleep. Soon he is addicted to attending support group meetings and has one lined up for each night of the week. Thats where he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter looking nothing like the poster girl for British period pieces) another ""faker."" Unlike Jack however she attends purely for the voyeuristic entertainment value. Then on what can be described as the worst day of his life (an airline loses his luggage and his apartment unit explodes destroying all of his possessions) Jack meets the flamboyant Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) a soap salesman with an unconventional view of life. Since Jack is in need of a place to live Tyler invites him to move in and the two share a ""dilapidated house in a toxic waste part of town."" Tyler teaches Jack lessons about freedom and empowerment and the two begin to physically fight each other as a means of release and rebirth. Soon others find out about this unique form of therapy and Fight Club is born - an underground organization (whose first and second rules are ""You do not talk about Fight Club"") that encourages men to beat up each other. But this is only the first step in Tylers complex master plan. In addition to lead actors Pitt Norton and Bonham Carter all of whom do impeccable work there are a pair of notable supporting players. The first is Meat Loaf (yes that Meat Loaf) who portrays the ineffectual Bob. Its a surprisingly strong performance with the singer-turned-actor capturing the nuances of a complex character. Jared Leto who is becoming better known to audiences (he was recently in The Thin Red Line) is the blond Angel Face. Told in a conventional fashion Fight Club would still have been engaging. However Finchers gritty restless style turns it into a visual masterpiece. The overall experience is every bit as surreal as watching Kubricks A Clockwork Orange. This is a tale that unfolds in an eerie alternate universe where the melodies of life have the same rhythm as in ours but are in a different key. Fincher also shows just enough restraint that his flourishes seem like important parts of the storytelling method instead of gimmicks. And there are a lot of them. In one scene a characters apartment is laid out like a page in a furniture catalog complete with text blurbs superimposed on the screen describing the various pieces. There are occasional single frame interruptions that flash by so quickly that they may pass unnoticed. The film opens with a truly inventive close-up - one that literally gets under the skin. Also in play a non-linear chronology a voiceover by a narrator who might not be entirely reliable frequent breaking of the fourth wall and an occasional freeze-frame. As was true of Finchers other three films Fight Club is dark and fast-paced. Theres not a lot of time for introspection. One could call this MTV style but unlike many equally frantic movies theres a reason for each quick cut beyond preventing viewers from becoming bored. Perhaps the most discussed aspect of Fight Club will be its attitude towards and graphic depiction of violence. Even before the films official premiere voices have been raised claiming that the movie glorifies violence by portraying it as something positive. This was the complaint leveled against A Clockwork Orange which less than three decades after its controversial release is universally regarded as a classic. Theres no denying that Fight Club is a violent movie. Some sequences are so brutal that a portion of the viewing audience will turn away. (The scene that caused me to wince was when one character reached into his mouth and pulled out a loose tooth.) But the purpose of showing all this bloody pummeling is to make a telling point about the bestial nature of man and what can happen when the numbing effects of day-to-day drudgery cause people to go a little crazy. The men who become members of Fight Club are victims of the dehumanizing and desensitizing power of modern-day society. They have become cogs in a wheel. The only way they can regain a sense of individuality is by getting in touch with the primal barbaric instincts of pain and violence. In A Clockwork Orange Kubrick depicted the actions of the Droogs but did not condone it. This is Finchers approach in Fight Club. As the film progresses he systematically reveals each new turn in an ever-deepening spiral that descends into darkness and madness. Theres also a heavy element of satire and black comedy. Macabre humor can be found everywhere from the pithy quips traded by Jack and Tyler to the way Jack interacts with his boss. When combined together the satire violence and unpredictable narrative make a lasting and forceful statement about modern-day society. Its a timely message that hints at why there are post office shootings and kids in schools killing their fellow students. By blaming movies like Fight Club for real-life horrors politicians want us to look at the world through rose-colored glasses that they have tinted. Instead Fincher offers a clear uncompromising portrait that disturbs because it is perceptive and defies the facile answers proffered by elected officials. Movies are not to blame. Guns are not to blame. People and the society that has spawned and stifled them are. The film has a scope not hinted at in the trailers. After all how could 139 minutes of untrained boxers beating the hell out of each other be interesting? Fight Club doesnt need to address that question because its agenda is much larger. To reveal more however would be to disclose twists and surprises best left for each viewer to uncover during his or her own movie-going experience. Of course as is true of all great films it is possible to know the entire plot of Fight Club beforehand and still be blown away by the experience. Without going into specifics I can state that there is a structural similarity to The Sixth Sense. Here however the twist is not the whole point of the movie and it is integrated more effectively into the overall story. If you figure out the so-called ""surprise"" in The Sixth Sense before the director wants you to its difficult to see that film as more than an overlong uneven example of overt manipulation. The opposite is true of Fight Club which possesses the depth and breadth to command the attention and respect of anyone who unveils the central conceit before it is explicitly revealed. Its also worth noting that this doesnt happen at the very end so while it is an important aspect of Fight Club it does not dictate the movies success or failure. It remains to be seen whether Fight Club will generate any Oscars. The strength of the writing direction and acting justifies a stream of nominations but quality has never been the driving factor in who is recognized by the Academy. Regardless of how it is received in February when the nominations are announced Fight Club is a memorable and superior motion picture - a rare movie that does not abandon insight in its quest to jolt the viewer. This marriage of adrenaline and intelligence will make Fight Club a contender for many Best 10 lists at the end of 1999.
