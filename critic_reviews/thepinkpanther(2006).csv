Plus Oh non its Steve Martins Clouseau. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures) Like a bat out of cyberspace Night Watch blazes into American cinemas to prove that homely Russia can produce a pixilated-vampire-superhero rock-and-roll Matrix-style thriller thats up there with the genres most exhilarating and ridiculous. The director Timur Bekmambetov hails from music videos and commercials and his tricks are all secondhand. He opens with one from column Eisenstein (a battle montage in which the medieval armies of light and dark face off) one from column social realism and three from column Wachowski BrothersUnderworldBuffy the Vampire Slayer. But the modern globalized action cinema is a smorgasbord anyway. What matters is that Bekmambetov is a whiz at mix and match and that he gives good head trips. The basic premise is . . . well theres nothing basic about it. See theres this uneasy truce between the Light and Dark Others The Lights license the Darks and keep the Night Watch while the Darks keep the Lights from infringing on their civil liberties during the Day Watch. Once in a while a Dark gets greedy for blood and summons a juicy new victim via telepathy whereupon the Lights track the prey with computers and a sort of Otherness empathy that requires them to drink blood too. The Darks dematerialize and materialize and can only be stopped by a flashlight that chars their flesh. And theres a wild card a pretty blonde whose hair swirls over her head to signal a destabilizing vortex that threatens to usher in the apocalypse. It all comes down to a prophecy that Given that what kills vampires from movie to movie always changes I think we need some sort of international conference to set the parameters. And Bekmambetovs tendency to throw FX at you indiscriminately isnt conducive to coherence. But he certainly has a lively palette. He juxtaposes fancy computer-generated imagery with the real dilapidated textures of Moscow then adds bright almost Afrocentric splotches of color. The action goes very very fast the camera whooshing into a subway tunnel and smack up against the guilt-ridden hero Anton (Konstantin Khabensky) who slinks around in sunglasses looking viciously hung over in the true Russian manner. Then it goes very very slowly as Anton enters a Dark region called the Gloom. (He has a great vampire-cop line when he encounters a Dark Other Step out of the Gloom) Night Watch isnt the only foreign film to put a new spin on a glossy Hollywood genre. In Turkey Valley of the Wolves Iraq is poised to break local box-office records with a story that smacks of vigilante flicks like Rambo. The film is very loosely inspired by the July 2003 detainment of Turkish soldiers by U.S. troops which provoked outrage throughout the country. In the film a Turkish mercenary gets revenge by waging a one-man war in northern Iraq on the American soldiers responsible. Billy Zane (BloodRayne) plays the evil American ringleader who gets snuffed in the end. After an owl turns into a naked woman (Galina Tunina) and becomes the heros tart sidekick Night Watch runs out of invention as Bekmambetov gets around to the laborious business of uniting the movies streams. And the ending is a huge letdown doing little besides setting the stage for the sequel Day Watch and a third film Dusk Watch. (Lets hope theyre not inflated into allegory like those dire Matrix sequels.) But for a good hour and change the film is a big toy box that teases you out of the Gloom. Amid a deluge of pointless remakes its gratifying to see one with a true raison detre a new take on Blake Edwardss slapstick mystery The Pink Panther. Edwardss film had a gaping hole in the center Peter Sellerss feeble one-joke Inspector Clouseau. Surely any modern comic actor could improve on Sellerss listless stylings If you believe a single word of the paragraph above then do I have a movie for you. No come to think of it even if you dont appreciate Sellerss glorious inventionone of the archetypal fools of the twentieth centuryyoull find the new Pink Panther an embarrassment. Steve Martin can be a delightfully spasmodic clown but his Clouseau makes no sense. Squinching his face and lapsing into an oddly feminine hauteur hes an imbecile who gets everything wrong until he suddenly inexplicably andmore importantunfunnily becomes a Sherlock Holmesian genius. Even slapstick needs to be motivated. Sellerss stillness his serene confidence in his own deductive genius generated seismic waves of chaos. Martin contorts himself in a void. I counted two and a half solid laughs and one respectable fart joke but the only genuine bright spots are Emily Mortimer squinting through big glasses while tottering on spindly legs and Clive Owen so elegantly arch as a British secret agent that you cant help thinking the right Bond was passed over. The foreign film Academy Award nominee (from Germany) Sophie Scholl The Final Days is powerfully rendered in every respectand another testament to how bad the Nazis are for drama. The true story of a young woman who distributed flyers to turn the German people against their Fuhrer the film boils down to a series of interrogations in which Sophie (the quiet luminous Julia Jentsch) first attempts to lie her way out of her predicament and then cornered adopts a radiant certainty about the rightness of her cause. I couldnt agree more with the need to stand up against Fascists but you know the Nazi judge a screaming skull wont discover the true meaning of Christmas. 1 2 Next Share this story...

In this contemporary comedy loosely based on the original film Inspector Clouseau is assigned to investigate the theft of the Pink Panther diamond and the accompanying murder of a football coach (Jason Statham killed off early). Parisian pratfalls lead to innocent-abroad escapades in New York with singing suspect Xania (Beyonce Knowles) in which Martin merges his own persona with a Sellers imitation with only some success. Some of Clouseaus trademark blunders may amuse those unfamiliar with the originals but in a modern movie with a contemporary actor the national stereotypes and farcical humour appear dated. The plot needless to say is negligible.

"Pink Panther The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pink-panther-the ) Pink Panther The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli There are only two reasons to see The Pink Panther and neither has anything to do with Steve Martin or his bastardization of Inspector Clouseau. The first is the opening credits cartoon - no matter how bad the movie at least the title character playing practical jokes to the tune of Henry Mancinis unforgettable theme doesnt disappoint. But its a sad thing when the best part of the movie comes before the movie starts. Then theres an opportunity for viewers to see Clive Owen as James Bond - sort-of. In the lone semi-inspired bit Owen appears as a dapper British secret agent with plenty of gadgets and a penchant for derring-do. (The Pink Panther which has been sitting on shelves for a while awaiting its prime February release date was filmed at time when Owen was considered to be the front-runner to replace Pierce Brosnan. Had that happened this movie would have scored a coup. Since it didnt this becomes an odd footnote.) This is the fifth Pink Panther movie without a (living) Peter Sellers. All but one 1968s Inspector Clouseau (with Alan Arkin) had the good sense not to re-cast the bumbling French inspector (the Roger Moore cameo in The Curse of the Pink Panther excepted). Sellers isnt just synonymous with Inspector Clouseau. He is Inspector Clouseau. You can re-cast a James Bond or a Doctor Who or a Superman but you cant re-cast a part in which the actor and the character have fused. Clouseau died in 1980 with Peter Sellers but filmmakers including series creator Blake Edwards havent realized it. Maybe if no one sees this version of The Pink Panther someone will get the message. Frankly with the possible exception of A Shot in the Dark the movies arent very good. Their chief selling point was Sellers as Clouseau. Even amidst the worst scripts he was funny. Steve Martin despite being a gifted comedian in his own right reminds us what were missing as we watch him fly to the brink of desperation trying to channel Sellers. And it doesnt work. We spend 90 minutes wondering when the impostor is going to remove his mask and reveal the real Clouseau. The absence of any of the other Pink Panther regulars deepens the hollowness. (Why no cameo for Herbert Lom or Burt Kwouk? One doubts they would have refused had it been offered.) Martin is miscast (as would anyone else be) and so is Kevin Kline. His version of Dreyfus is bland - a word no one ever would have used to describe Loms interpretation of the character. Jean Reno does an okay job playing Clouseaus assistant (and even gets to copy a move or two from the absent Cato). The less said about BeyoncA(c) the better. Shes gorgeous and has a great voice but any acting skills she may possess are absent here. Here cleavage leaves a deeper impression than her performance. The plot is dumb enough that it could have been written for one of the Sellers movies. The coach of the French national soccer team (Jason Statham in a cameo) lies dead on the field a poison dart in his neck and his gaudy ring - which contains the Pink Panther diamond - missing. Chief Inspector Dreyfus in a bid to inflate his own importance and popularity decides to import the most incompetent police officer he can find promote him to inspector and let him bungle the investigation. Then when all is nearly lost Dreyfus can ride to the rescue arrest the miscreant and bask in glory. His choice for the patsy is Clouseau but the newly minted Inspector fools everyone including perhaps himself by solving the crime. The movie mostly consists of pratfalls and verbal mangling. The bad French accent may have been funny 40 years ago but the last drops of humor have long since been wrung out of it. So we get stuff like the unfunny ""hamburger"" bit that drags on for so long that one is sure the End Times have come and gone in the meantime. Its like a bad Saturday Night Live skit. Lackluster director Shawn Levy (Cheaper By the Dozen - another Steve Martin retread) pilfers several of the gags from earlier Pink Panther movies but the old stand-bys are no longer funny. Nor is the new stuff which includes fart jokes and a bit of stupidity featuring Viagra. The Pink Panther is supposed to use humor to uplift. Instead I departed this movie feeling depressed. Lifeless comedies can suck the energy out of a viewer especially when they sully the image of an cinematic icon. The film is bad enough in its own right that it wont work even for those who dont know who Peter Sellers is - it will seem disposable and silly with too many jokes that dont work. But for those who recall Sellers and the role he made famous ""travesty"" seems to be the right descriptor.

"Steve Martin in The Pink Panther. Slate Sign In Sign Up Steve Martin in The Pink Panther. Steve Martin in The Pink Panther. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 10 2006 403 PM The Death of Inspector Clouseau Steve Martins uninspired Pink Panther. By Dana Stevens Steve Martin in The Pink Panther Let us now ponder the mystery of Steve Martins career. In the past decade or so its diverged into two discrete and contradictory channels Theres Steve Martin the auteur (of three novels a collection of plays and ""serious"" film scripts like Shopgirl or the upcoming Picasso at the Lapin Agile both based on his own work); and Steve Martin the lowbrow the shameless purveyor of crap like Cheaper by the Dozen Parts 1 and 2 Father of the Bride Parts 1 and 2 or Bringing Down the House the Martin/Queen Latifah race comedy which has mercifully stopped at Part 1 (so far.) Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. A colleague of mine tells me that his 6-year-old daughter whos very keen to see Martins latest comedy The Pink Panther refers to it as ""The Pink Pander."" The kid displays remarkable critical acumen. The film directed by Shawn Levy who was also behind both Cheaper by the Dozen movies falls squarely into the second crappy category of the Martin oeuvre. Yet theres something strangely ambitious about the project too if only because of the enormous hubris of undertaking to remake the Pink Panther franchise. Advertisement Not mind you because the original films are any good--with the partial exception of the first one The Pink Panther (1963) they hold up poorly to a second viewing. Blake Edwards is a clumsy unintuitive director and seen now the old Panther movies feel leadenly paced depressingly cynical and full of disquieting racial and sexual stereotypes. But they contain at their molten core the rich and strange performances of Peter Sellers. As the accident-prone imbecile Inspector Clouseau Sellers is almost frighteningly funny His mangled accent and masochistic pratfalls seem to tap into some inner source of sadness and rage. One of the most striking qualities of Sellers as Clouseau is that--especially in the later installments of the series as he grew increasingly resentful of this unchallenging cash cow of a role--he no longer cares about being liked by the audience. His French accent grows incomprehensibly gnarled his relation to the other actors increasingly remote and by his final fullinstallment Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978) he seems to be inhabiting his own parallel movie. Theres no danger of that happening with the Pink Pander Steve Martin whose version of Clouseau is nothing if not professional. Except in one scene when an American dialogue coach tries and fails to teach him to pronounce the word ""hamburger"" Martin wisely curbs the temptation to impersonate Sellers. But he also fails to offer anything new any reason to resurrect the series or the character beyond the desire to scare up a few laughs and I guess forklifts of cash. Martins careful at times funny but utterly unnecessary rendering of Clouseau raises the question that haunts every remake Why? The brand-name recognition must be very faint by now in the memories of the audience at whom this movie is aimed (and who in the screening I attended were finding it pretty funny at least the fart jokes). Still The Pink Panther isnt anywhere near as bad as it could be. There are a few verbal gags that recall the Lewis Carroll-esque absurdity of early Steve Martin routines ""Dont you think its a coincidence that the victims body fell perfectly within the chalk outline?"" And theres at least one laugh-out-loud visual gag involving Martins and Jean Renos donning of trompe loeil bodysuits that blend in with the marble walls of a ballroom theyre trying to infiltrate. The Pink Panthers MacGuffin--the theft of a giant pink diamond from the finger of a murdered soccer coach--is so negligible as to be unworthy of summarization. Its the flimsiest of pretexts for a cops-and-robbers plot that has Clouseau and his bodyguard sidekick Ponton (Jean Reno) dashing around the globe in pursuit of Xania (Beyonce Knowles) the victims girlfriend. Their clueless journey is overseen by the self-important Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline whos allowed to exercise a tenth of his comic potential--maybe he should have played Clouseau). But the slightness of the storyline wouldnt be a problem if the movie took on its project of reviving the Panther series of with any real wit originality or joy (think of Mike Myers sinking his fake yellow scraggleteeth into the role of Austin Powers). Instead this movie leaves us with the stale whiff of fake nostalgia and something even more odoriferous the smell of money. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Pink Panther"" with Steve Martin Kevin Kline Jean Reno Emily Mortimer Henry Czerny Beyonc Knowles. Directed by Shawn Levy from a screenplay by Len Blum and Martin based on characters created by Maurice Richlin and Blake Edwards and on the ""Pink Panther"" films by Edwards. 92 minutes. Rated PG for occasional crude and suggestive humor and language. Several theaters. Its impossible to hate a film in which Steve Martin and Jean Reno perform an interpretive dance while dressed in floral bodysuits. (Many movies for that matter could well benefit from a scene involving interpretive dance and floral bodysuits.) So let me say that Shawn Levys rehash of ""The Pink Panther"" is not entirely bad. Then again it certainly isnt very good either. The role of the bumbling Inspector Clouseau complete with hammy French accent was created by Peter Sellers in Blake Edwards 1964 film ""The Pink Panther."" Sellers and Edwards made a handful of sequels and the franchise continued even after Sellers death in 1980 though it eventually petered out so to speak. Now its back after a long absence with the characters of Clouseau (Martin) and his boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) recycled and virtually everything else re-invented. (Luckily Henry Mancinis deliciously slinky ""Pink Panther"" score returns showing no signs of age.) When a world-famous soccer coach is murdered Inspector Clouseau is hired as a fall guy to investigate the crime. With the help of Gendarme Gilbert Ponton (Reno) and Clouseaus sweet bespectacled secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) various suspects are identified chief among them the coachs pop-star girlfriend Xania (Beyonce Knowles). All of this is interspersed with pratfalls (by my reckoning the first one comes at about the 90-second mark) silly faces goofball French accents accidental electrocution unlucky bicyclists and flaming mojitos one of which is consumed by Clive Owen in a slick but pointless cameo as Secret Agent 006. Ultimately it doesnt add up to anything and Levy mostly succeeds only in passing the time. The screenplay written by Len Blum and Martin feels like a series of bits rather than a story and the actors do shtick rather than creating characters. But shtick is no stranger to the ""Pink Panther"" series and some of it is actually pretty funny. Just some of it mind you Kline is surprisingly dull Knowles isnt remotely stretched by playing a gorgeous pop diva and Levy doesnt seem to know what to do with Kristin Chenowith who totters through the movie alertly as if awaiting a cue that never comes. Others register nicely particularly Mortimer who demonstrates a bug-eyed loopy charm. And after the dreariness that was ""Shopgirl"" there are pleasures in seeing Martin returning to his comedy roots even in as uneven an endeavor as this. His Clouseau purses his lips and spits out his lines certain that hes saying things just the right way. (In a discussion of womens shoes his pronunciation of pumps -- ""pooomps"" -- is perhaps the funniest thing in the movie.) Its an entertaining performance but lets hope that its Inspector Clouseaus swan song. ""Its an idiom"" mutters a suspect to Clouseau whos questioned a figure of speech. ""You sir are the idiom"" intones Martin. Though not a total disaster this ""Pink Panther"" is too often shall we say idiomatic. Its time to let the Inspector rest in peace. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com Information in this article originally published February 10 was corrected February 13. In a previous version of this story the actor playing the James Bond cameo was misidentified. He is Clive Owen not Daniel Craig.

Photo credit Etienne ... more Photo Etienne George Zee joke is on anyone who pays for zis movie 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Pink Panther Comedy. Starring Steve Martin Kevin Kline and Jean Reno. Directed by Shawn Levy. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. ) This is what happens when friends dont tell each other the truth. Steve Martin didnt tell Shawn Levy he had no business directing a slapstick comedy and Levy didnt tell Martin that he just wasnt funny as Inspector Clouseau. And so now its left to critics and audiences to break the news about this graceless embarrassing effort to resurrect the ""Pink Panther"" franchise. That ""The Pink Panther"" is as awful as this comes as a surprise. True the movie goes in with the disadvantage of competing with the memory of the Blake Edwards/Peter Sellers ""Pink Panther"" collaborations. That series which became a beloved mainstay in the 1970s didnt produce masterpieces -- most were uneven -- but Sellers portrayal of Clouseau was a masterpiece full of ridiculous invention and meticulous detail. No one could top him but in a way that makes Martins task easy Martins only job is to be funny in his own way. He has been funny in his own way for 30 years. But something is off in Martins approach. Sellers played Clouseau as a ludicrous character but Martin plays him as a ludicrous caricature -- and one thats more off-putting than engaging. His Clouseau rather than hiding his insecurity behind a mask of dignity is genuinely smug. Instead of striving to imitate the great man he hopes to become he thinks he has already arrived. Martin plays a person who in another context would be clearly riding for a fall a comic narcissist on the way to his comeuppance. But here of course theres no comeuppance. Hes our hero. The distinction is worth emphasizing The problem is not that Martins strategy isnt like Sellers but rather that Martins comic strategy isnt funny on its own terms. Clouseau is a character who creates havoc around him. When Sellers played him Clouseau would observe the havoc and be mortified and try to cover for it by a pretense of unflappability. His embarrassment and his game but lame attempts at concealing his culpability were priceless. By contrast Martins Clouseau is simply oblivious or supercilious. He really doesnt care what damage he causes. The warning signs come early in the first 30 seconds of screen time. There are two opening slapstick bits and neither works. (That means they had nothing funny to start the movie.) The first bit involves an old lady getting hit on the head and the other shows a man on a motorized wheelchair crashing spectacularly thanks to Clouseaus meddling. This opening announces the movies comic intention a wrong one. In this ""Pink Panther"" film the victims of Clouseaus clumsiness rarely include himself just other people. The story is inconsequential and thats all right. Kevin Kline plays Chief Inspector Dreyfus the role immortalized by Herbert Lom who hires Clouseau to investigate a high-profile murder case. Dreyfus hopes Clouseau will fail so that he might solve the case himself and seize the glory. He teams Clouseau with a capable detective (Jean Reno) as his minder and sets him loose. As comic actors Martin and Kline are similar. They both tend to play superficially elegant high-status players whose gracefulness and geniality form a thin facade over an abyss of pettiness ego and avarice. Theyre both funny -- usually -- but here theyre pursuing the same kinds of laughs in their scenes together and they collide instead of mesh. Beyonce Knowles shows up as a pop-singing suspect and performs parts of two numbers. Clive Owen has a nice cameo as a British agent 006. Its nice to see them. Its nice to see anyone in between the stillborn and misbegotten comic setups. Throughout comic business is introduced but not elaborated upon. Jokes dont build but are cut short. If ""The Pink Panther"" has any value at all its in the way its failure demonstrates the delicate nature of comedy and the skill of other comedies by contrast.

"Da-dumb da-dumb . . .new `Panther seriously un-funny - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Pink Panther Da-dumb da-dumb . . .new `Panther seriously un-funnymovies - reviewFebruary 10 2006|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticThe Steve Martin remake of The Pink Panther invites some serious pondering about the difference between ""brilliance"" and ""genius."" The films 100 minutes allow for that as there is little funny going on to distract deep thinkers.Martin may seem to have earned the right to be compared to the late great Peter Sellers and thus the chance to remake the movie that launched Sellers fame. But brilliant Martin an intellectual comic who started his career slumming in sophomoric slapstick is entirely too uptight to be genius Sellers greatest creation the incomparable incompetent that boobs boob Inspector Jacques Clouseau.Start with the silly French accent. Martin cant fake one or find a way to make the words come out funny. He settles on a speech impediment.The physical shtick which Sellers supposedly improvised on the spot Martin doesnt even attempt. Jim Carrey would have broken limbs to get laughs. Martin doesnt rumple his suit.This Panther begins with the murder of a soccer coach played by Jason Statham no doubt happy to be off the set so quickly. His gigantic Pink Panther diamond ring was stolen. Who killed him and took it? The Chinese whom he had crossed? The casino owner-partner (Roger Rees) whom he crossed? The singer-lover (Beyonce Knowles) he was cheating on? A teammate?The chief inspector (Kevin Kline in a role Herbert Lom twitched into history) needs a patsy ""the worst policeman in all of France"" to try and fail so that he the chief can come in and save the day thus earning a medal. He sends Ponton (a befuddled Jean Reno) to assist/spy on Clouseau. And the fromage hits the fan as Ponton learns Clouseaus techniques.Questioning the curvy Beyonce -- ""Stop brow-beating her Cant you see shes sexy?""A suspect is found dead.""Was it fatal?""""Yes.""""How fatal?""""Totally.""""I want to talk to him. Now""The occasional laugh is beside the point. The Panther movies were about pretension a homely undereducated and class-conscious detective who puffs himself up to think hes as dashing smart and highborn as the people he investigates and who does his best to cover the incompetence that he realizes is blowing his cool. His accidental undeserving victories drive his boss nuts. Martin doesnt dig deep enough to find that and Kline doesnt play meltdowns well.Clive Owen (playing a faux Bond) Emily Mortimer and Kristin Chenoweth are among the other talents who have nothing funny to do here.Martins latter career has been marked by moments of great ambition (Bowfinger Shop Girl) interrupting a long lazy slide into sellout. His director for this fiasco Shawn Levy also remade Cheaper by the Dozen with Martin. Both no doubt pulled down nice checks for this abomination. I hope they choke on them.Fatal? Well not totally.

Running time 93 minutes. Rated PG (mildly crude humor and language). Da-Dum-da-dumped into theaters for the bleak midwinter after it was ruled not funny enough for last summer the relaunch of ""The Pink Panther"" is one puny puma. Comedy aint baseball; three funny jokes out of 10 doesnt cut it. Its more like free-throw shooting Youd better be over 60 percent. Starring Steve Martin as the bumbling French detective Inspector Clouseau in a script he co-wrote ""The Pink Panther"" occasionally works and has a handful of great moments. Theres Clouseau striking fey karate-chop poses but not actually making contact with anyone as his macho partner (Jean Reno) wipes the floor with three thugs. And when the two of them sneak through a palace disguised as wall hangings only to be forced to impersonate Ramp;B dancers there are large laughs. Most of the time though Martins true gifts are never unwrapped. He and director Shawn Levy his collaborator on ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" aim for the toddlers-and-up audience so there are almost no sex or toilet gags. Kids dont get cultural and observational jokes or complex plots so all of that goes too. Whats left? Objects running amok and people getting poked in the eye pretty much sums it up. As Clouseau investigates the theft of a huge pink diamond ring nicknamed the Pink Panther which went missing when the soccer coach who was wearing it was murdered many gags are obvious or go nowhere. Clouseaus foil and boss Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) who brings nothing to the role played expertly by the twitchy boiling Herbert Lom in the Peter Sellers movies) has a pen that leaks a lot. So what? And do you care if Dreyfus desk toy gets ruined? There is only a hint of ""Austin Powers"" genre-mocking Beyonce Knowles as a singer-suspect in Paris pleads ""Do I have to stay in town? I have something vague to do in New York."" Beyonce otherwise serves as talking scenery which is frustrating to anyone who saw her star in MTVs hip-hop take on ""Carmen"" a performance that brought so much heat my TV nearly exploded. Martins French accent is amusing - he gets more mileage than you would think out of mispronouncing ""hamburger"" - but watching him crash around the set is often tiresome and theres no need at all to have Emily Mortimer as Clouseaus assistant step in to lose her glasses and walk into a tree. (She shouldnt try to steal his blunder.) At his best Martin isnt truly a physical comic but an absurdist ""Do not leave ""Europe or Asia"" Clouseau warns one suspect. Many ridiculous notions that could go somewhere though (Clouseau falling in love with McDonalds in Times Square) are simply dropped in favor of pratfalls and puns (""You sir are the idiom"") unworthy of him. Nothing is connected to anything else; the characters dont learn or change the mystery is barely there (a stack of previously unmentioned clues is sorted out in a rush at the end) and the gags dont build on each other but merely line up in single file like planes taxiing for takeoff. You could wander into ""The Pink Panther"" for any 15-minute period laugh a couple of times and leave without wondering for a moment how things will turn out. Its a shame that one of the few countries with a simpletons taste for old-fashioned slapstick -France-wont get this movie. How do you translate Clouseaus request for a burger - ""Ah weud lahk to buy a amburrgare"" - back into French?

Rarefied palates prefer the first two in the series -- The Pink Panther (1963) and A Shot in the Dark (1964) -- but the fourth and fifth The Return of the Pink Panther (1975) and The Pink Panther Strikes Again (1976) are more idiotic more overstated more grooved-out-70s -- and funnier. Theyre the first films in which Peter Sellers Inspector Jacques Clouseau boasts a mangled Frahnsh accent (in the previous three its merely French) and the first in which he comes across as a boob of biblical proportions (in the previous three hes merely inept). By comparison the third movie was a footnote. The sixth one sagged. The seventh was made with leftover footage after Sellers died; the eighth starred Ted Wass as a non-Clouseau stand-in; and the ninth with Roberto Benigni as a Franco-Italian nerd-boy stank. All but the third were directed by Blake Edwards. In all but the third Sellers played Clouseau. But here we have a 10th Pink Panther film directed by Shawn Levy and starring his Cheaper by the Dozen lead Steve Martin and it doesnt stink. Au contraire Its good. Maybe not a masterwork but good enough to redeem the series and its intrepid mustachioed twit. Even the best Pink Panther movies were never great cinema just great fun; the scripts were vehicles for Sellers genius which combined lordly timing with a gift for absurd physical comedy. He was a buffoon but he was a buffoon with dignity whether vacuuming a womans chest or destroying someones priceless Steinway (""not anymore""). In this prequel Clouseau destroys plenty -- including his boss Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline twitchier in the role than Herbert Lom). A nominal plot involves the murder of the French national soccer coach and the theft of his gargantuan Pink Panther diamond two crimes assigned to Clouseau for the highly logical reason that hell screw them up thereby allowing Dreyfus to swoop in and save the day in pursuit of a Medal of Honor. Got that? Good now forget it. The story makes no sense and doesnt matter except as an excuse to break stuff set stuff on fire crash bicycles and shoot poison darts across casinos. Pop sensation Beyonce Knowles plays the dead coachs pop-sensation girlfriend a casting choice that allows le bumbling Clouseau to interrupt a recording session and fart at length into a microphone. Emily Mortimer Henry Czerny and Jean Reno hold traditional supporting roles in a Pink Panther film that is they stare at the man with emotions spanning from mild confusion to mute shock. (Look for Clive Owen in a James Bond-like detour.) Martin captures both Clouseaus ineptitude and his pride. He does his own weirdo take on the accent and Im not sure it works but I admire him for trying. He honors the part without aping Sellers using his own gifts for slapstick twinned with a schlimazels self-absorption. Hes geekier than Sellers more childlike less imperious. But when he says ""Keeller I weell find you . . . because Fwahnce is Fwahnce"" I couldnt help but laugh. Fans of the series will find familiar elements (Henry Mancinis slinky theme) mixed with new (Clouseaus computer woes). The only innovation that feels like sacrilege is the penultimate sequence found in any modern comedy when things get all sniffly-wiffly and the hero atones for his sins. Clouseau? Apologetic? To use the French give moi a break. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post You will leave ""The Pink Panther"" still wondering if Steve Martin does Peter Sellers proud or done him wrong. Meanwhile the children will be cackling all the way home ""AM-bourg-air Ah wood lock to bah uh AM-bourg-air"" This fairly tame ""Panther"" remake works on at least one level It claws its way straight to the shallow soul of 10-year-olds made hysterical by flatulence. That would include me much of the time. One of the funniest scenes involves Inspector Clouseau (Martin) retreating to a soundproof recording booth to make himself as the French might say sans gas. That lovely rock star Xania (Beyonce) has left the microphone on is a glorious Gallic given. Another high point Clouseau flooding a bathroom at the Waldorf-Astoria crashing through the floor onto the front desk then calmly dinging the bell and demanding ""Fresh towels in 204"" If you are as clueless as Clouseau in figuring out what happens next in this kind of movie when someone declares ""This intruder is wearing a flesh-colored mask"" then dont go. Neither flatulence nor Francophiles can save you. The original ""Pink Panther"" series from the incomparable straight man Sellers and naughty director Blake Edwards was pitched at sly adults - more martinis than mugging. This one co-written by Martin with Len Blume is pitched at sly children. Some adults may enjoy the chaperone duties; many others will slink to another screen in the multiplex. As the bumbling French inspector Clouseau Sellers was the dual embodiment of Everymans daydreams and nightmares. He imagined himself to be sophisticated even as everyone around him shoveled scorn. He always allowed a split-second of agonizing self-awareness just when things were at their worst then immediately persevered in deluding himself back to the top. Martin has displayed the same qualities since before ""The Jerk"" and while he is prone to some of that extra mugging he clearly respects the Sellers ideal. His writing style is more obvious than the laid-back originals but he can still sell a line ""What are the chances the body would fall exactly within the chalk outline on the floor"" I would say dont sweat the details but some will still ask about plot. The French national soccer coach is assassinated; chief inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) worries no one can solve the case so he seeks a fall guy on whom to blame a bungled investigation. Enter Clouseau fresh off a banana boat the size of a supertanker. But with the able (and quaintly amusing) backup of sidekicks Jean Reno and Emily Mortimer Clouseau conquers all. Along the way fountain pens leak burglars hide behind curtains fingers are stuck in live electrical sockets. Antique globes bounce down steps and into the streets there to wreak havoc on the many French bike racers who dared to question Lance Armstrong. Clouseau tries the good-cop/bad-cop routine starring in both roles. Questioning the curvaceous Xania Clouseau snaps at his partner ""Why must you browbeat her? Cant you see shes sexy?"" Its not quite on the high comedic plane of ""Do you have a license for that moon-key?"" But AM-bourg-airs will do. Just ask the kids.

"Martin manages to avert disaster in passable Pink Panther remake - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Martin manages to avert disaster in passable Pink Panther remake By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  February 10 2006 Well at least Steve Martins trying to be funny again.For months a black cloud of disaster has hovered over the remake of The Pink Panther."" Originally scheduled to open last summer it was later moved to the cinematic dog days of February. Martins own record of reworking comedy classics has run from the profitable lameness of the Cheaper by the Dozen"" movies to outright fiascoes like Sgt. Bilko."" The original Peter Sellers Panther"" movies -- the good ones anyway -- are farces beloved by connoisseurs of precision slapstick. Things did not look good.Its with palpable relief then that I can say this new version of the misadventures of Inspector Clouseau -- a prequel officially -- isnt a black hole of unfunniness. Instead its another passably engaging Steve Martin vehicle a few solid laughs a lot of dead air no earthly reason to exist. If it sends you out of the theater thirsting for the real thing a box of five of the original movies has conveniently just arrived on DVD (minus 1975s The Return of the Pink Panther"" sadly but including the best of the lot 1964s A Shot in the Dark"").If youve seen the trailer with Martins fey Clouseau mangling the pronunciation of hamburger"" youve seen the best gag in the movie. Still the new Panther"" is harmless enough even if it doesnt stand to advance Franco-American relations. A hard-charging Paris soccer coach (Jason Statham) has been murdered on the field and his priceless pink diamond ring stolen; suspicion falls on among others his pop singer girlfriend Xania (Beyonce Knowles). Vainglorious Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline) assigns the worst police detective in France to head the case; that way the boob will divert the media while he Dreyfus finds the killer and wins the French medal of honor.Enter Martin in full gendarme regalia as Clouseau; no sooner has he taken the case than furniture gets broken vases are smashed and large metal globes go rolling into the streets to take out the front line of the Tour de France. Clouseau is assigned a watchdog assistant in the person of detective Gilbert Ponton played by Jean Reno with the embarrassment proper to a French actor in a movie where everyone else talks wiz foony acc-zents.This includes Kline who trots out his crack Fish Called Wanda"" timing and Englands Emily Mortimer as Clouseaus pert klutz of a secretary. Knowles for her part acts with her cleavage her singing voice and her big brown eyes which is enough to bowl over Clouseau and at least half of the audience. Clive Owen has a cameo as a smooth British secret agent; since Daniel Craig has been cast as the next James Bond this is clearly as close as Owens going to get.Very occasionally the new Panther"" approaches the droll hilarity of the original movies -- a sight gag involving magnifying goggles is played beautifully straight -- but more often than not Martin winks at the audience to let us know he knows hes being silly. Worse the script makes the mistake of letting Clouseau solve the case legitimately rather than bumble serenely to victory and that goes against everything Sellers and the old Pink Panther"" movies stood for. Suffice to say that Shawn Levy director of the Cheaper by the Dozen"" movies is no Blake Edwards; for every finely tuned slapstick fillip theres a ton of messy family-friendly buffoonery.Its all in the balance. Not all of the old Pink Panther"" movies had it but at Sellerss peak his Clouseau struck a perfect clueless poise between idiocy and refinement -- between the suave gesture and the bone-rattling pratfall. Those movies were comedy ballet. The best Martin can do here in one all-too-brief scene is an inspired wild-and-crazy frug. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Then pile on Bringing Down the House plus the outright atrocity that was Sgt. Bilko. And you know what? Steve Martin has fun with the role of Inspector Clouseau. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures Its tough to see much red about a new version of The Pink Panther when the mostly ill-used titan Steve Martin is finally back in substantial form taking on Peter Sellers most ""owned"" role. At the very least its no desecration to see Martin take a flying leap (multiple actually) at playing French police Inspector Jacques Clouseau from director Blake Edwards revered Panther series. (Related story Beyonce is pretty in Pink) There I said it. A French soccer coach gets murdered publicly here as a ""Pink Panther"" diamond is stolen. But as ever the casualties that matter are all Clouseau victims logic the English language and antagonized police chief Charles Dreyfus. Transforming Clouseaus perennial nemesis into a more urbane smoothie Kevin Kline delivers like a pro -- though his performance is dwarfed by memories of Herbert Lom who originated the role and his degrading descents into foamy lips and straitjackets. About the movie The Pink Panther    out of four Stars Steve Martin Kevin Kline Beyonce Knowles Jean Reno Emily Mortimer Clive Owen (unbilled) Director Shawn Levy Distributor Columbia Rating PG for occasional crude and suggestive humor and language Running time 1 hour 33 minutes Opens today nationwide Highest marks in the foil department go to Jean Reno as a stolidly confused Clouseau colleague and Emily Mortimer (perfectly adorable) as a dizzy morale-booster. The movies ringer is Beyonce Knowles as one of the zillion suspects. As with Fran Jeffries in the first Panther pic Knowles big number is good for some chanteuse-y hot-cha But her benumbed performance isnt helped by a self-conscious tendency to laugh affectionately at Clouseaus antics. The script co-written by its star is often clever. But the big questions are Martin vs. Sellers and (this Pinks director) Shawn Levy vs. Edwards. Forget the second matchup Its no contest. Edwards brought a widescreen distinction (both in decor and actor movement) that is cavernously missing in this entry. Some of screen historys most violent sight gags played off Edwards visual elegance (kind of like Jerry Lewis mandating that much of his own slapstick be done in a tux). But even if you give Sellers the edge in facial expressions Martin is his equal in mangled verbiage. Martins mouthings probably arent for everyone. But I suspect the same people wholl resist them would have panned the original films. (Some of us took names.) Though retreading screen traditions is among current movies most odious practices the newly clawed Panther makes me guffaw -- though I wont go to the mat defending it. Except on one count Take away 1999s Bowfinger and this is the first prototypical Martin comedy in years.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 10 2006 Save for later Saved I yield to no one in my admiration for Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau but what do you know - Steve Martin is just as funny. He doesnt try to imitate Sellers but instead puts his own distinctive spin on the bumbling detective. This must be the first time that a great comic has taken over the signature role of another great comic and made it his own.It might seem at first that Clouseau and Martin are not a good fit. Apparently Martin felt the same way; he initially rejected the part when it was offered to him. But it turns out that the casting is perfect.Martin has been mired in family comedies like the ""Cheaper By the Dozen"" series where he doesnt really get to cut loose so many of us may have forgotten just how hilarious he can be. As Clouseau he is as peerlessly silly as he was in ""The Jerk"" ""The Man With Two Brains"" and ""All of Me."" He is even reminiscent of the Cyrano character from ""Roxanne."" Like that other ardent romancer his Clouseau is battling a handicap - in this case extreme stupidity - and against all odds he makes the man deeply touching. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The plot such as it is revolves around the murder of a famous French soccer coach and the mysterious disappearance of the Pink Panther diamond ring intended for his fiancee (Beyonce Knowles). For nefarious reasons of his own Chief Inspector Dreyfus (an expertly reined-in Kevin Kline) brings in Clouseau from the hinterlands to crack the case and teams him with a stone-faced gendarme (Jean Reno). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 That stone face is the perfect comic complement to Martins which is always in motion. He darts his narrowed eyes for danger and sniffs the atmosphere for clues only he can detect. With his little mustache - a curvy wing beneath each nostril - Clouseau at times resembles Charlie Chaplins Monsieur Verdoux. His French accent with its dropped aitches and low-slung vowels is a thing of beauty. (A scene where an increasingly exasperated Clouseau is coached to say the word ""hamburger"" is an instant classic.) Martin understands that perhaps the first prerequisite of a great funnyman is the invention of a language a way of speaking that is his alone.The second prerequisite is that he move like no one else and Martin who at his peak is as comically agile as Buster Keaton understands that too. The staging of the physical comedy in ""The Pink Panther"" is not always adept - director Shawn Levy is no Blake Edwards - but Martin who co-wrote the screenplay keeps spinning in his own orbit anyway. And what an orbit it is. Grade A- Rated PG for occasional crude and suggestive humor and language.

Consider Martins great silent stage act ""The Great Flydini"" consists of pulling an abundance of objects from his open zipper. And now in The Pink Panther playing the role of bumbling Inspector Jacques Clouseau first made famous by Peter Sellers in Blake Edwards 1964 caper of the same name Martin once again brings his trousers to the party. Ensconced in a posh hotel suite with Beyonce Knowles playing an international pop diva his Clouseau fumbles with a drink called a Flaming Mojito and long story short eventually emerges from the nearly wrecked hotel with his crotch smoking. The sight of the handsome white-haired Martin (black moustache smartly trimmed and eyebrows set on Go) maintaining his dignity in the face of self-propelled chaos is the artists signature philosophical stance. Its a classic. Everything charming about this pale Pink Panther -- as well as everything else much less so -- is on display in that scene. Martins gift for physical and vocal comedy is as deft as ever -- he chews over the pronunciation of hamburger the way Sellers masticated his monkey. But the plot involving a murder a missing diamond and a vain police chief (Kevin Kline) makes a short story long. And in fishing for appeal to a younger audience (with a pretty but tonally wrong Beyonce and the jokes about Viagra calling plans and Flaming Mos) director Shawn Levy and his team squander Martins old-timey hipster appeal -- everything that makes his act fly.

The real question is whom this juvenile revival will attract. Finally unleashed after multiple delays ""The Pink Panther"" is neither the disaster one might have suspected nor a fully realized madcap farce; rather Steve Martins foray as Inspector Clouseau exhibits bursts of wild-and-craziness but hardly enough to sustain even its relatively brief running time. The result is a feature-length ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch with arid stretches interrupted by moments of irresistible silliness. The real question is whom this juvenile revival will attract given that the franchise would seem to possess little resonance among modern youths -- its most likely audience -- beyond Henry Mancinis marvelously playful original score. Using the title of the 1964 original but little else Martin (who shares script credit) starts out as Officer Clouseau whose ineptitude catches the eye of Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Kevin Kline recycling his ""French Kiss"" accent). With Frances soccer coach murdered and his famous Pink Panther diamond stolen Dreyfus sees an opportunity to achieve fame and renown -- especially if he solves the cases after the newly promoted Clouseau bumbles it. So after a moribund introductory sequence Clouseau is let loose on Paris where he engages in a series of pratfalls misunderstandings and puns pursuing suspects that include the victims girlfriend Xania (Beyonce Knowles) an international pop star. Hes also saddled with a stoic sidekick Ponton (Jean Reno) whose job is to report back to Dreyfus. Having recently ventilated his serious side in ""Shopgirl"" Martin has considerable fun with Clouseaus mangled English (perhaps the funniest scene has him struggling to pronounce ""hamburger"") and subtly pays tribute to Peter Sellers. Part of that homage entails turning earlier ""Panther"" moments on their head -- a gag featuring a runaway globe for example or his decision to periodically attack Ponton the way Cato once assaulted Sellers Clouseau. Reunited with ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" director Shawn Levy Martins Clouseau also overwhelms those around him in much the way Sellers did including Emily Mortimer as a coworker with whom he keeps becoming physically entangled as well as Kristin Chenoweth and Roger Rees whose talents are mostly wasted. Ditto for Knowles who isnt stretching by playing a pop diva and as in her ""Austin Powers"" assignment is again relegated to the status of gorgeous prop. ""Stop browbeating her"" he chides Ponton for interrogating Xania. ""Cant you see shes sexy?"" Shot in Paris and New York with side trips to Italy and Prague at its best this new ""Pink Panther"" is a hit and largely miss exercise -- a glass about three-quarters empty or one-quarter full depending on ones eagerness to succumb. Granted there are some genuine chuckles amid the slapstick wordplay and flatulence (yes flatulence) but ultimately the pic cant deliver a consistent level of lunacy. (Its only fair to say that the later Sellers films were equally deficient and as HBOs recent biopic made clear the star was completely miserable doing them.) Notably in a sign of MGM synergy theres an uncredited cameo by a dashing Agent 006 which at first seems quite clever. Even that though doesnt really go anywhere providing additional evidence that reloading 40-year-old franchises isnt always as simple as just slipping a new star into the old wardrobe.
