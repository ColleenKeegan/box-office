Henson Dont Embarrass Themselves or Their Studio in a Perfectly Serviceable Thriller ""Belle"" star shines as director Gina Prince-Bythewood stays true to the message without ever getting pious or preachy When Viola Davis appeared at the 2012 Academy Awards without her usual wig and wearing her natural hairstyle it was a gesture toward personal and emotional authenticity. This gesture can be felt as the animating impulse behind writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewoods ""Beyond the Lights"" a Relativity release (which recently premiered at the 2014 Urbanworld Film Festival) that begins with a shot of a young girls curly hair. Working-class single mother Macy (Minnie Driver) is determined to see her daughter Noni win a talent contest but she needs the help of a kindly hairdresser to get her daughters unruly curls in line. Young Noni sings Nina Simones ""Blackbird"" with all her heart but the first prize goes to a tap-dancing and smiling little white girl while Noni gets first runner-up. Macy stiffens with anger at the unfairness of the decision as she drags her daughter off the stage and orders her to throw away the second-best trophy out in the parking lot. She wants her daughter to be a winner the best of all and nothing will stop her from reaching that goal. Also read 7 Questions With Return to Zero Star Minnie Driver Emmy Nominee Quickie After this parking lot scene the film disorientingly cuts to a salacious pop video where we see a girl wearing a mauve weave and throwing her barely-clad body around in an aggressively sexual fashion in the company of rapper Kid Culprit (Machine Gun Kelly) to a song called ""Masterpiece."" This girl it turns out is the grown-up Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw from ""Belle"") who is about to break out with a solo album selling herself as a piece of sexual pop fantasy. Noni walks around with her handlers and her controlling mother with a disconnected discontented look so it comes as no surprise when she sits on a railing of her hotel room and wavers for a moment wondering whether she should jump. Luckily a hunky flawlessly upright and nurturing cop with political ambitions named Kaz (Nate Parker) is right there to talk her off the ledge to pull her up when she falls and to tell her he ""sees"" her. Also read Minnie Driver Rapper Machine Gun Kelly Join Relativitys Blackbird (Exclusive) The rest of ""Beyond the Lights"" tells the story of the romance between Noni and Kaz all laid out in careful point-by-point detail. Describing the story of this movie makes it sound like it could very easily be corny and even campy but Prince-Bythewood and her cast takes all of it so seriously and with such honest emotion that there is no plot point when a sense of plausibility falters or when a big moment devolves into silliness even a confrontation between Noni and her mother where Macy delivers a slap to her daughters face. If this were a different kind of enjoyably bad movie that slap might have been met with laughter and hoots but Prince-Bythewood keeps her camera on Nonis anguished face after the slap in extreme close-up so that we dont laugh at it. In every scene here Prince-Bythewood calmly and sensitively melts our resistance to the outlandish outsized quality of her plot and stays true to the message she wants to deliver without ever getting pious or preachy. The central relationship between Noni and Kai could use tightening particularly in a love scene down in Mexico that feels a bit unnecessary but their Mexican trip also contains the movies best scene where Kai charmingly tries to sing some karaoke for her and then she gets up and sings ""Blackbird"" a cappella. Mbatha-Raw sings the song with intense and sometimes touchingly oblique emotion and Prince-Bythewood smartly captures a variety of reactions in the audience at the karaoke bar after the song is finished some touched yes but some stunned and uncertain too. Its in a detail like that that Prince-Bythewood shows her commitment to the likely truth of a given situation and it is this commitment that lets her get away with making her message movie on show business integrity. Also read Belle Director Amma Asante on How the Indie Drama Turned Her Into a Hollywood Player Never is this commitment better displayed than in the way she handles Drivers mother who could easily be a hissable villain but winds up being a three-dimensional person with a variety of feelings and reactions. ""Beyond the Lights"" advises us to throw away our weaves and put on some Nina Simone records and thats a message we should all get behind. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw plays Noni a young British R. amp; B. singer working in the United States and perched on the brink of stardom. Kaz (Nate Parker) a quiet and polished Los Angeles police officer rescues her from a suicide attempt and then to the dismay of Nonis domineering mother (Minnie Driver) romance blossoms. Meanwhile Kaz feels pressure from his father (Danny Glover) who has been grooming him to run for office. The film offers an intriguing look at the tense crafting of personae by pop stars and politicians alike behind-the-scenes meetings with cold-blooded executives and gimlet-eyed clergymen the careful management of aggressively prowling paparazzi and interviewers in the mainstream media. The process however is primarily a backdrop. The plot pivots on Nonis yearning for authenticity beyond her flashy and hypersexualized public image but the character and her aspirations are flattened into cliches. Mbatha-Raw hits all the right notes but lacks the force of personality. With Machine Gun Kelly as Kid Culprit Nonis musical collaborator.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

"Gugu Mbatha-Raw in Beyond the Lights reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Beyond the Lights Had Better Make Stars of Its Two Hot Leads Beyond the Lights Had Better Make Stars of Its Two Hot Leads Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 14 2014 620 PM The Ballad of Kaz and Noni Beyond the Lights soars on the chemistry of its two young stars. By Dana Stevens Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Nate Parker in Beyond the Lights. Courtesy ofSuzanne Tenner/Relativity Beyond the Lights writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewoods show-business romance about the slowly blossoming affair between an ascendant pop star and a down-to-earth L.A. cop is as shamelessly soapy as movies come--but I challenge you not to slip on the soap bubbles and fall right in to this movies invigorating bath. Onscreen love stories live and die on the connection between their leads and as the troubled singer Noni Jean and her earnest protector-turned-paramour Kaz Nicol Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Nate Parker all but spontaneously combust each time they look at each other. That kind of chemistry can take a less-than-perfect screenplay a long way. Even when Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball) tries to pack too much around the edges (including critiques of record-industry sexism and the mechanisms of black political fundraising) the romance at the movies center remains credible and vibrant. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Noni and Kaz meet under circumstances that kick things off at a high emotional pitch Shes about to throw herself off the balcony of her Beverly Hills hotel after winning an award for her hypersexualized Ramp;B video. Hes been stationed outside her hotel room to fend off groupies--but when he hears a scream from Nonis horrified mother Macy (Minnie Driver) he bursts into the room and rescues the young woman from the ledge. In the press conference that follows the incident Nonis people try to pass it off as an accident rather than a suicide attempt which rubs the scrupulously honest Kaz the wrong way. But when Noni shows up at Kazs door a few days later to thank him for saving her life he cant resist going for a drive with this rising star who he soon learns feels hopelessly boxed in by her sex-doll image and her controlling momager. Against the advice of Kazs father (Danny Glover) whos trying to launch a career in politics for his squeaky-clean son the cop and the pop star start to fall for each other and she breaks things off with her former fling white rapper Kid Culprit (played by rapper Machine Gun Kelly). As an act of revenge Kid sexually humiliates Noni onstage during their live duet at the BET Awards in a hard-to-watch number that evokes both slavery and Samp;M in its use of bondage imagery. The ensuing televised melee--because really what good is a new boyfriend who doesnt jump up onstage and punch out your nasty ex on live TV?--puts both Nonis future at the record label and Kazs political career in danger. Advertisement In the kind of conflict-free second-act stretch every romantic drama should treat itself to Noni and Kaz decamp from L.A. to a modest vacation hideaway in Mexico where they drink margaritas sing karaoke and fall further in love. Their idyll will eventually be interrupted by the paparazzi and Nonis furious mother but not before Noni has gotten in touch with her simpler prestardom self. At the karaoke bar she wows the crowd with a rendition of Nina Simones ""Blackbird"" (the movies musical high point thanks to Mbatha-Raws unaffected delivery) and back in the beach bungalow she dares to appear to Kaz without her glamorous purple-streaked weave in all her natural curly-headed glory. One thing to admire about the conventionally structured and occasionally corny Beyond the Lights is the delicacy and lack of stridency with which it handles questions of race and gender. Rather than assigning her characters righteous speeches about the exploitation of women by the culture industry Prince-Bythewood shows that exploitation at work in the demeaning photo shoots and music videos that Nonis career arc requires her to participate in. And it isnt until late in the film that Nonis biracial identity becomes an explicit issue as her pushy stage mother (a surprisingly complex villain as played by the always excellent Driver) recalls her years as a single mother in London public housing with a half-black child. But Beyond the Lights considerable date-night appeal springs principally from the fact that its a movie about a rising superstar that features two of them--Mbatha-Raw and Parker both enormously appealing impossibly attractive performers with big futures ahead of them. They will undoubtedly soon be seen on screens doing something more weighty than twirling in the surf of a Mexican beach with sculpted abs on glorious display. But I cant begrudge them this moment in the sun and I wont begrudge you the pleasure of watching them. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Photo Credit Suzanne Tenner advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A troubled Ramp;B starlet falls for a young policeman. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE A tepid reworking of ""The Bodyguard."" Impressive costumes and music though. CAST Gugu Mbatha-Raw Nate Parker Minnie Driver LENGTH 156 It would be interesting to watch ""Beyond the Lights"" with someone like say Rihanna. The movies heroine is Noni a successful but unhappy Ramp;B starlet known for her sexually provocative videos. As a child Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) wanted to sing like Nina Simone but todays fans want fantasies. At a Billboard Music Awards ceremony Noni obligingly shows up wearing little more than gold chains and a massive choker -- slave-bling essentially that symbolically degrades her gender and perhaps her race. Its one of several striking images that hint at what ""Beyond the Lights"" might have been. Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love and Basketball"") the movie can be a surprisingly pointed take on the entertainment industry here depicted as a machine driven by self-exploiting women and the men who sell their records. Mostly though ""Beyond the Lights"" is a tepid romance in which Nina falls for Kaz (Nate Parker) a handsome young cop stationed outside her Los Angeles hotel room. advertisement | advertise on newsday Lets get the obvious comparison out of the way ""Beyond the Lights"" is a faint shadow of 1992s ""The Bodyguard"" without the star power of Whitney Houston or Kevin Costner. Thats a bad idea even on paper though Mbatha-Raw makes a convincing Noni. Last seen playing an 18th century aristocrat in ""Belle"" the actress trades her corsets for stripper-shorts and does some creditable singing dancing and writhing. Colson ""MGK"" Baker plays Nonis boyfriend a sleazy Eminem type named Kid Culprit; Minnie Driver plays her overbearing single mother and manager. Almost single-handedly sinking the movie is Parkers Kaz a humorless emotionally stifled character who mostly squints and grimaces. Parker showed glimmers of life as a troubled soldier in 2012s ""Red Tails"" but here he sucks the fun out of his every scene. Prince-Bythewood deserves credit for hammering the music industry harder than most price-of-fame dramas dare. Her film also feels remarkably authentic and contemporary thanks to canny costumes by designer Sandra Hernandez and original tracks co-written by pop producer The-Dream. Too bad the movies sharp commentary gets smothered in schmaltz. 233 MoviesBeyond the Lights trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

A savvy stage mom a disappointed but supportive father and the hip-hop biz bedevil the singer and the cops romance in ""Beyond the Lights"" written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. If you are lactose intolerant you may want to forgo this drama. Because yes there is a mild hint of cheese to this wish-fulfillment saga. But Im a fan a connoisseur and writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewoods movie is a tasty pleasure -- more Stilton than Kraft slices. Brit actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw portrays Noni the U.K. import with the fierce manager mom. Minnie Driver no stranger to the hurdles of the music industry has an impeccable edge as Nonis mother Macy. ""You wanna be a runner-up. Or you wanna be a winner?"" she snaps at a young Noni (India Jean-Jacques) after a talent contest where the sweet kid sings Nina Simones heavy-duty ""Blackbird."" (""You aint never gonna fly ... "") Nonis biggest night in a young career -- success at the BET Music Awards in L.A. -- finds her dangling from a hotel balcony. Her boyfriend record- label mate and Eminem avatar Kid Culprit (rapper Machine Gun Kelly) has headed to his next gig. The only thing between Noni and the tabloids exploitative mourning headlines is officer Kaz Nicol. Did she intend to leap? Was she just tipsy? The entertainment press has its theories. We know the girls hurting. So does Kaz. Nate Parker is the police officer with the grip of life a shelf full of political tomes and a plan to run for office. Danny Glover plays the elder Nicol a police department lifer with political ambitions for his son. Whatever is brewing between the cop and the singer isnt part of the trajectory. Parents with dreams deferred is a theme here. Mother love is in short supply. Kazs mom left his father awhile ago. Macys many things but maternal isnt one of them. Although a late showdown between Macy and Nonis record- label execs holds out promise. Director Prince-Bythewood who made the move from television to the big-screen in 2000 with the terrific romance ""Love and Basketball"" has a way with actors. Parker is alluring and steady as Kaz. Driver is hard-bitten but not shaded. You can add Noni to Mbatha-Raws terse but impressive filmography. Want a sense of her star-promising breadth? Watch this uncanny Rihanna/Beyonce amalgam then rent ""Belle"" the sumptuous period piece about Dido Elizabeth Belle the mixed-race niece of the British chief justice who heard the case that changed the slave trade. Far more pop ""Beyond the Lights"" comes with a couple of a moments that recall the trials of three sisters in the musical drama ""Sparkle"" (the original) as well as Diana Ross more triumphal return to Chicago and Billy Dee Williams in ""Mahagony."" But those stirrings are a pleasure. Prince-Bythewood herself gives a shout-out to ""The Rose"" and ""Purple Rain."" Still the scene when Noni takes off the accoutrements of her increasingly constraining persona -- the nails the makeup the weave -- provides a unique wonderful shock all its own.

For all its honesty itas never slow and for all its criticism of the music industry itas never finger-wagging. 528 Shares Share 358 Tweet 169 Share 1 Share Email Print Share Photo Blackbird Productions Do we even make romantic dramas anymore? We make romantic comedies and we make romantic melodramas -- over-the-top Sparksian wallows in tragedy sure. But how often do we see movies in which plausible people fall plausibly in love and face plausible challenges? And yes I am about to use the word plausibleA to describe Gina Prince-Bythewoods magnificent Beyond the Lights which on its surface seems to be a candy-colored pop fantasy about the love between a beautiful hip-hop superstar and a hunky cop. To be fair its not not that. But how bracing today to have a film thats at once fun patient romantic and real. This is Prince-Bythewoods first film since 2008s underrated The Secret Life of Bees. As the ads remind us she also gave us 2000s unforgettable Love amp; BasketballA -- another rare romantic drama released in a sea of rom-coms and melodramas. Watching Beyond the Lights it feels as if an old friend has reentered the room. The story opens in 1998 with young Noni (played by India Jean-Jacques as a child and the great Gugu Mbatha-Raw as an adult) coming in second place at a talent contest after giving a haunting rendition of Nina Simones ""Blackbird."" Noni is happy with her award but her overwhelmed driven mother (played by Minnie Driver with all the wild unpredictability of an exposed nerve) tells her to ""chuck it"" -- its either all or nothing for her. Flash forward to the present day Noni is a sensation doing guest-stints on hit records promoting her upcoming debut album gracing magazine covers in scantily clad outfits and dating a big-shot rapper named Kid Culprit (played by the rapper Machine Gun Kelly/MGK who proves adept at both humor and subtle pathos and yes I just used the words subtleA and Machine Gun KellyA in the same sentence). Mom still manages Nonis life and it appears that the win-at-all-costs ethos has rubbed off on the daughter as well. That is until one night when Noni attempts to throw herself off a hotel balcony and is saved at the last second by an unassuming attractive cop named Kaz (Nate Parker). And away we go. Kaz a.k.a. ""Officer Hero"" as hes dubbed by the press is immediately whisked into playing a part in the Noni Story having to navigate between his integrity and the demands of the celebrity machine. The singers people want to cover up the fact that she tried to take her life. ""Nonis supposed to be the girl every guy wants and every girl wants to be"" hes told. ""Suicide isnt sexy."" For her part Noni sees in Kazs kind curious eyes someone who seems genuinely to care for her well-being. ""I see you"" hed yelled out on that balcony as he tried to save her. But what does he actually see? Shes a concoction -- a mass-produced fantasy of purple hair hot pants and attitude. Does he actually perceive the girl beneath the image the one we saw in those opening scenes? Of course he does This is a love story remember. But one of the films great strengths is that it takes its time letting the two characters get to know one another. In Love amp; Basketball and 2000s underseen HBO movie Disappearing Acts Prince-Bythewood proved herself a master of intimacy of both the spoken and unspoken kind. In part this is because shes not afraid to slow down and just watch her characters taking time out from the busywork of narrative. Her patience pays off. She can capture the world in a single exchange of glances. And her characters have a way of talking about the world and revealing their own truths as they do so. Kaz confesses to Noni that he cant fly in airplanes. ""I cant put my life in someone elses hands"" he tells her. ""Thats funny"" she replies. ""My whole life is in someone elses hands."" That notion of whom (and what) we allow to control our lives becomes a key theme in Beyond the Lights. As Kaz dives further into Nonis world he sees the way the industry works its tricks -- how it strips her of her identity and talent as cavalierly as it strips her of her clothes and how the feedback loop of celebrity culture provides real-time commentary on everything she does. But Kaz too has begun to cede control Egged on by his father (Danny Glover) hes pursuing a career in politics. ""I just want to be a brother that makes a difference"" he says; it sounds both hopelessly earnest and hopelessly calculated. Parker plays the uncertainty just right; even he doesnt know if hes being sincere or bullshitting. In fact both leads walk a fine line between confidence and confusion between perception and identity. Mbatha-Raw received a lot of justified acclaim earlier this year for the period piece Belle but believe it or not this might be the more complicated impressive part. Beyond the Lights is a deft gorgeous movie. For all its honesty its never slow and for all its criticism of the music industry its never finger-wagging. Prince-Bythewood re-creates the hyperstylized imagery of music videos and awards shows indulging in their pop absurdity while allowing an undercurrent of melancholy to course through. And she somehow does it all without ever letting the story get out of control too ridiculous or fantastical. That may be Beyond the Lights greatest accomplishment and why for a film so seemingly frivolous it hits so hard As we watch this dreamy colorful piece of musical and romantic wish-fulfillment we get the distinct sense were watching real life unfold.A Tagsmoviesmovie reviewbeyond the lightsgugu mbatha-rawgina prince-bythewoodMore Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories What Do the Women of Cleveland Want From Melania Trump?

Watch Kanye Wests Tearful Wolves Video Starring... Beyond the Lights A suicidal superstar and an earnest cop bond in this surprisingly spot-on musical drama Minnie Driver and Gugu Mbatha-Raw star in Relativity Medias Beyond the Lights. Credit Suzanne Tenner By Peter Travers November 13 2014 More News Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff Band to Watch Machine Gun Kelly All Stories >> It sounds like chick-flick hell A stage mother (Minnie Driver) pushes her Rihanna-like daughter (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) so hard that the kid almost dives off a hotel balcony before her first album drops. In Bodyguard style a decent cop (Nate Parker) shows up to save her. To everyones surprise especially mine the cliches yield a remarkably engrossing love story with the wit to know truth from twaddle. Writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood who performed similar magic with Love amp; Basketball (2000) knows her way around the business of show and showing off. The details ring deep and true. After her start as a biracial Brit tyke in a cheap music competition - her a cappella version of Nina Simones ""Blackbird"" is a heartbreaker - Noni (Mbatha-Raw) builds a career through ""face-down ass-up"" packaging. Mom doesnt mind as long as shes the one doing the exploiting. Its Noni who balks at faking Samp;M sex onstage with her white-rapper lover (Colson ""Machine Gun Kelly"" Baker). She yearns to let out her natural voice. More News Fall Movie Preview Finally the Good Stuff Band to Watch Machine Gun Kelly All Stories >> Prince-Bythewood is stingingly astute at what fame does to objectify women. Low self-esteem leads to Nonis suicide attempt. Its Kaz (Parker) an L.A. cop with political ambitions who talks her off the ledge. Their romance is far from storybook. Her mom wants him gone. So does his cop dad (Danny Glover). There are times when Noni and Kaz dont see a future in each other. Theres enough plot here to sink a soap opera but the actors prevail. Parker is a no-bull charmer. Driver leaves bite marks on her juicy role. And Mbatha-Raw so good this year in Belle is dynamite. The dark fires she reveals under Nonis cool exterior singe the screen. Even her Ramp;B/hip-hop singing hits the mark in songs by the-Dream. Mbatha-Raw has been nominated with the likes of Julianne Moore and Patricia Arquette for a Gotham Independent Film Award. Shes a shining new star. Beyond the Lights brims with surprises that befit the title. Its electrifying. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

I wish the movie took its own advice. Its being sold as a rather sensitive definitely serious film about two twentysomethings -- one a singer with a pushy mother the other a cop-turned-politician with a father he hero-worships -- who have to move beyond their parents dreams to find their own. But at its own heart? Its a soap opera -- ""The Bodyguard"" without the interracial romance or big musical score. The storys even got a VH1-ready title roman-a-clef show-biz angles bad dialogue gratuitous pecs-and-violence and plotting that perches precariously on the edge of ridiculous. If it were any cheesier they could pour it on macaroni. The thing is thats fine. Theres no shame in ripe melodrama -- look again at the one-hour female-centric sensations on weekly network television and find me one that isnt. (The male-centric ones tend toward simple violent fantasy.) Yet director Gina Pryce-Blythewood and her actors keep their tongues firmly out of their cheeks and play it all as straight as if they were doing Eugene ONeill. Which is no fun. At all. The film at least is a good showcase for Gugu Mbatha-Raw a warm actress of lively confidence who already carried ""Belle"" this year. Here shes Noni a vulgar half-dressed hip-hopper who secretly wants to be the next Nina Simone. Mbatha-Raws a good dramatic performer an accomplished singer and is shown off to star-making effect - but shes not enough and her ""big"" dramatic moment (she finally takes out her weave) already feels like a shoo-in for some listicle of Bad Scenes We Love. (""A Star Is Shorn""?) Less impressive is Nate Parker as her boyfriend (who in the films silliest idea launches an L.A. political campaign - overnight). Frankly hes here strictly to take off his shirt and look dopily devoted - its the Taylor Lautner part - and he regularly obliges. The rest of the cast is rounded out by Minnie Driver (excellent as Mbatha-Raws domineering mother) and Richard Colson Baker (absurd as a white rapper who calls himself Kid Culprit. Because yeah nothing carries more street cred than a terrifying moniker like Kid Culprit). Admittedly the people are pretty the music scenes are well-staged (theyre supposed to be crude and corny right?) and weve needed a silly romance for awhile now. But for all its hugs and kisses the film refuses to embrace itself. At one point the characters even hole up in a Mexican hotel and watch telenovelas. And you want to say Really? This is the kind of stuff you want to watch? Girl look around. Ratings note The film contains alcohol abuse sexual situations violence and strong language. Beyond the Lights (PG-13) Relativity (116 min.) Directed by Gina Pryce-Blythewood. With Gugu Mbatha-Raw Nate Parker Minnie Driver Richard Colson Baker.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 14 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 14 2014 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood Written by Gina Prince-Bythewood Starring Gugu Mbatha-Raw Minnie Driver and Nate Parker Classification 14A Country USA Her name is Noni Jean which sounds like Norma Jean who is Marilyn Monroe who was swallowed by the fame and lost in the machine. You know how it goes Goodbye Noni Jean.Beyond the Lights stars the luminous and soulful Gugu Mbatha-Raw (star of 2013s Belle) as an almost-superstar British singer who is living the music-biz dream but has lost herself in the process. Shes a product not a person; a causality of her own success and shes falling. Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman promote their new film Fury and discuss the horrors of war at a press conference in Seoul. (Nov. 13) AP Video Video Video Brad Pitt promotes Fury in Seoul Video Video Why Matthew McConaughey went sci-fi with Interstellar To her rescue comes a Los Angeles police officer He sees her (if no one else can) and attempts to save her. At the L.A. hotel after Noni wins an award at a Billboard gala one member of her entourage scoffs ""The cop thinks hes the bodyguard.""The Bodyguard. Whitney Houston will always love Kevin Costner and arent we suckers for the romantic narrative trope?Gina Prince-Bythewoods Beyond the Lights is a formulaic often melodramatic crowd-pleaser with thoughts on celebrity-driven culture and the ravenous appetite of fans followers and the media. The films prologue which is set in 1998 touches on the paparazzi-related death of Princess Diana.Also in 1998 we see young mixed-race Noni at a junior talent contest in working-class South London. She sings Nina Simones Blackbird very capably and finishes a respectable second place to a cute little hula-hoop specialist.But second place isnt good enough for Nonis fierce single mother and demanding stage mom played with zeal and flared jawbones by Minnie Driver. ""You wanna be a runner-up or do you wanna be a winner"" she asks her daughter roughly and rhetorically. Wow how do you like them apples? Young Noni who wishes to please her parent cries and throws away the trophy.There are few a themes running through Beyond the Lights. One has to do with parents and the dreams they hold for their children. Nonis mother devotes her life to her daughters career but shes also seeking a sort of redemption with Nonis accomplishments standing in for her own lack of success. Its the same way with the handsome upright police officer Kaz played with strength coolness and a notable torso by the impressive Nate Parker. His father (Danny Glover) has a plan for his son which involves a police career leading to civic office. Kaz like Noni is a rising star with a parent attached to the ascent.The romantic path of Kaz and Noni has its detours and false starts. As for their own paths they both have something holding them back. Nonis is an insecurity in her own abilities She does sexy Ramp;B wears revealing costumes and is reluctant to sing her own lyrics (which she hides in a shoebox of course).Simones Blackbird a sorrowful ballad about restrictions and being caged in is the films soul and thread ""Blackbird you aint ever gonna fly."" In Nonis case its metaphorical. With Kaz its literal - hes afraid to board an airplane. Pretty clunky writing there.There are other clunky bits within a plot that seems familiar. ""Congratulations youre a bloody cliche"" mom says to Noni in a particularly overwrought moment. A cynical critic might apply that to the film itself.Youll have to watch Beyond the Lights to find out if the blackbird ever does get to fly but theres a good chance you already have an idea. If nothing else the film serves as a personal cautionary tale for the Barbadian bombshell and star singer Rihanna. As for Mbatha-Raw shes got wings - no cages for her.

(Photo Suzanne Tenner)Beyond the Lights is a good example of a movie overcoming itself. It battles cliches every step of the way but the honesty of its two lead performances lift it up.The movie follows Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) a Rihanna-like pop singer and an up-and-comer in the hip-hop world. Shes driven by her controlling momager (a stern Minnie Driver) who pushes her to become a star over all else.But Noni isnt happy. One night after an awards show shes dangling over the balcony of her Los Angeles hotel room ready to take a fall. Shes rescued by Kaz (Nate Parker) a caring police officer assigned to keep an eye on her.When Kaz pulls her to safety they click; he sees something in her vulnerability she likes that he sees past her celebrity. Thus begins their unlikely romance and Nonis journey of self-discovery beyond as the title says the lights.The dialogue is clunky (""I feel like Im suffocating in the middle of the street and no one can see me dying"" Noni says at one point) and the script runs down the checklist of familiar celeb-tale tropes from the celebrity who longs to be a ""real artist"" to the star who despite all the attention in the world is lonely inside.But Mbatha-Raw and Parker find the souls in their characters and their chemistry elevates the film above its straight-to-VH1 pedigree. And writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love amp; Basketball"") scores by lending the film a dose of reality; rapper MGK plays Nonis friend and Detroit rapper Big Sean makes a cameo as himself.""Beyond the Lights"" doesnt have much insight into the world of modern celebrity but as a romance its actors make it sing.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaBeyond the LightsGRADE BRated PG-13 for sexual content including suggestive gestures partial nudity language and thematic elementsRunning time 116 minutes 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1qH2i2i MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/11/14/beyond-lights-better-cliches/18992935/,200,beyondthelights11,beyondthelights,detroitnews
"Review Beyond the Lights a showcase for singer Gugu Mbatha-Raw - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Beyond the Lights is showcase for Gugu Mbatha-Raw Beyond the Lights Suzanne Tenner / Relativity Media Nate Parker and Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars in Relativity Medias ""Beyond the Lights."" Nate Parker and Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars in Relativity Medias ""Beyond the Lights."" (Suzanne Tenner / Relativity Media) Martin Tsai If ""Belle"" put the actress on Hollywoods radar Beyond the Lights heralds her superstardom From the writer-director of the beloved ""Love amp; Basketball"" Gina Prince-Bythewood ""Beyond the Lights"" seems like it will follow the tried-and-true celebrity-and-commoner formula seen in ""The Bodyguard"" and ""Notting Hill.""But the first sign this film aspires to be much more is the pitch-perfect opening scene set in dank 1998 south London where a white mother hurries into an Afrocentric salon after hours seeking help with her mixed-race daughters hair before the next days talent contest. The girl finishes second. Fast forward to years later when Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw of ""Belle"" and ""Doctor Who"") has become a pop sensation under the micromanagement of stage mom Macy (Minnie Driver). For one music video Noni dons Samp;M garb and gets paired with white rapper Kid Culprit (an uber-diabolical MGK a.k.a. both Machine Gun Kelly and Richard Colson Baker) -- an evocation of slavery that encapsulates the soullessness of showbiz.Nonis romance with Kaz (Nate Parker) a Los Angeles police officer moonlighting as a bodyguard blossoms exactly as youd expect. But the film still delivers its social critiques taking the record industry to task for selling sex and debasing women. Noni eventually undergoes a metamorphosis both physical and musical from a Rihanna into a Corinne Bailey Rae. Along the way Mbatha-Raw looks sounds and moves like an A-lister. If ""Belle"" put the actress on Hollywoods radar ""Beyond the Lights"" heralds her superstardom. A flurry of accolades and a record deal should follow.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 752 p.m. EST November 13 2014Nate Parker and Gugu Mbatha-Raw in Beyond the Lights.(Photo Suzanne Tenner Relativity Media)While melodramatic in the vein of A Star Is Born Beyond the Lights is also a wise and open-hearted look at the price of fame upon personal identity.A romantic drama set amid the music industry ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) it also provides a powerful message to girls and young women not to conform to hypersexualized hip-hop images.The story opens with 10-year-old Noni (India Jean-Jacques) a shy bespectacled girl singing a moving a cappella version of Nina Simones Blackbird at a talent contest in her native London. She gets second place and her ambitious stage mother (Minnie Driver) orders her to toss the trophy.""Do you want to be a runner-up or do you want to be a winner?"" she asks her young daughter as they get into their beat-up station wagon.USA TODAYFoxcatcher pins Carell and cast in sordid true storyFlash-forward about a dozen years and Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) has chucked the glasses and the natural curly hair. Shes a glamorous star a la Rihanna or Nicki Minaj singing duets with a famous hip-hop artist and wearing scanty stripper-style gear gobs of makeup and purple hair extensions. She wins a Billboard Music Award and her transformation from quiet biracial girl to exotic recording star seems complete. But the pressures are eating away at Noni. Underneath all the posing shes deeply unhappy. The celebratory night culminates in a desperate act.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The pressures of fame have superstar singer Noni on the edge until she meets a young cop who works to help her find her courage in Beyond the Lights. VPCEnter handsome policeman Kaz (Nate Parker) whos assigned as Nonis security detail. Though it sounds like a cross between The Bodyguard and the plot of a contemporary romance novel this movie has more substantive ideas on its mind. Somehow miraculously the predictable saga skirts cliche.The soundtrack fuels the movie but its essentially about finding ones way and embarking on an authentic life plan.USA TODAYJon Stewarts humor leavens tough-minded RosewaterNonis life has been masterminded by her mother but her maternal motivations slowly surface showing shes not the heartless manipulator she seems to be.At the same time Kaz who sincerely wants to help people is being pushed by his well-meaning police officer father (Danny Glover) to go into politics. Both have lofty parental expectations to live up to. Both are pushed to put their careers above all else. And both are ultimately saved by love. While this could have been an all-too-predictable tale (hampered by a clunky title) the familiar story is buoyed by terrific performances by a pair of talented charismatic actors. Parker conveys an innate sense of decency and strength as well as sensitivity. Mbatha-Raw projects vulnerability intelligence and warmth and is thoroughly believable as a singer. USA TODAYMiss Meadows aims to teach you a lessonBoth actors are strikingly attractive and Parker is shown shirtless as often if not more than Mbatha-Raw which offers cinematic ogling parity. However writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood has created fully drawn characters that are more than pretty faces and toned bodies. Noni and Kaz have enough depth and dimension for the audience to root enthusiastically for them.Hollywood churns out romantic comedies but romantic dramas -- unless theyre of the sickly-sweet Nicholas Sparks variety -- are less numerous. With its focus on integrity creativity and identity Beyond the Lights is a rare intelligent romantic drama. 99 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1urnmyN",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/11/13/beyond-the-lights-review/18101791/,200,beyondthelights13,beyondthelights,usatoday

"Beyond the Lights star Gugu Mbatha-Raw shines in music-industry romance review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies Beyond the Lights star Gugu Mbatha-Raw shines in music-industry romance review Music-industry romance Beyond the Lights puts a different spin on a songbird in a gilded cage tale. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Nov. 13 2014Beyond the LightsStarring Gugu Mbatha-Raw Nate Parker Minnie Driver and Danny Glover. Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. 116 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 14AHollywood loves to remind us that stardom aint all its cracked up to be.Music-industry romance Beyond the Lights puts a different spin on a songbird in a gilded cage tale with this drama about burgeoning pop diva Noni (an incandescent Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and her troubled rise to the top.Article Continued BelowWhile similar narratives usually focus on misunderstood artists chafing against expectations by wanting to perform their music their way writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) elevates the tone.Here the booty-smacking sexualization of female pop artists is a big part of the conversation and a factor in making Noni question the compromises she has to make in her rise to the top.Off the top we see Noni as a Rihanna-like video star sporting skimpy bondage wear and a violet weave to school noxious co-performer Kid Culprit (real-life rapper Machine Gun Kelly) in the ways of women.Noni is capable of more although the films opening track ""Masterpiece"" written for the film by Beyonce and Rihanna hitmaker Terius (The-Dream) Nash shows she has what it takes physically and vocally to send a song up the charts.Theres still plenty of melodrama most of it furnished by Minnie Driver as Macy Nonis high-strung up-from-poverty single parent a driven stage mother who makes Gypsys Mama Rose seem like an introvert.Macy shepherds her daughter from talent show runner-up (India Jean-Jacques doing a soulful rendition of Nina Simones heartbreaker ""Blackbird"" as the 10-year-old Noni) to Billboard Awards headliner. And when her daughter finds the demands of fame are stealing her soul Macy is not about to let her mess things up.So shes quick to put a positive media spin on how Noni ended up needing rescue from a hotel room balcony by Kaz (Red Tails Nate Parker very good here) an L.A. cop on security detail. He talks the distressed diva down with assurances about seeing the real her. Macy makes sure hes crowned ""Officer Hero."" Cue the photo op.While Kaz doesnt understand much about Nonis life he gets the nature of parental pressure. His police chief father played by Danny Glover is relentless in encouraging him to seek public office.Noni tries to explain her public image while Kaz asks her to consider why she allows the record label -- and her mother -- to objectify her to bolster her popularity while refusing to let her pursue more personal goals.Their inevitable romance while predictable manages to scoot out from under soap opera pretensions thanks to solid chemistry between the two very likable leads. But its really all down to Mbatha-Raw who cant help dominating every scene.Shes an appealing and engaging actress and her range is evident as she follows up last years historical drama Belle with something contemporary. In Belle the British actor impressed in the title role of Amma Asantes movie about an 18th-century woman born the illegitimate child of an African slave and a white naval officer and raised in an aristocratic British home.Mbatha-Raw is clearly destined for bigger things. Consider Beyond the Lights a stop along the way.Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Machine Gun Kelly in Beyond the Lights.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Minnie Driver Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Nate Parker star in this drama about a superstar singer and the young police officer who helps her to find her own voice. (Relativity Media) By Ann Hornaday November 13 2014 Follow AnnHornaday A shamelessly entertaining mash-up of ""Gypsy"" and ""The Bodyguard"" finely tuned to the blingy excess of the hip-pop era ""Beyond the Lights"" is a movie brimming with promise and unexpected pleasures. Structured as a conventional stage-mother melodrama this go-for-broke backstage romance written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love amp; Basketball"") admittedly suffers from inertness during its most starchily emotionalistic passages. But it also fully owns its wish-fulfillment fantasies of love fame and ambition set within an overarching bid for authenticity that gives what might have been a disposable piece of eye candy an admirable sense of groundedness. The fact that the films star Gugu Mbatha-Raw delivers a genuinely galvanizing performance as a singer searching for her own voice makes ""Beyond the Lights"" not just enormous fun to watch but surprisingly gratifying on an artistic level. Like the early Oscar hopeful Eddie Redmayne in the far more high-minded ""The Theory of Everything"" also opening locally this week Mbatha-Raw undergoes an astonishing physical transformation in service to the role of a young British prodigy. The fact that ""Beyond the Lights"" proudly occupies a middlebrow genre means that Mbatha-Raw will most likely be overlooked for the seasons biggest awards the casualty of snooty high-low distinctions that with luck will mean nothing to audiences who like their pulp escapism served with smarts and good taste. Mbatha-Raw plays Noni who throughout her childhood has been pushed into stardom by her ruthlessly driven single mother Macy (Minnie Driver). After a painful prologue when Macy cruelly forces 10-year-old Noni -- beautifully portrayed by India Jean-Jacques -- to ""chuck"" a second place trophy shes won in a South London talent competition we meet doe-eyed lavender-tressed Noni all grown up gyrating lasciviously in a music video and wearing heavy gold chains to accept her first Billboard Award. The symbolism of those chains like everything else in ""Beyond the Lights"" isnt subtle. But restraint is completely beside the point in a film that luxuriates as much in the outlandishness of its imagery as in the fairy-tale nature of its narrative. When Noni has a pivotal episode with the off-duty Los Angeles policeman guarding her hotel room the encounter sparks a romance. But it also awakens a sense of self-worth thats been latent while her mom-ager has been urging her to do whatever it takes to be famous whether that means disrobing at the drop of a flash bulb or hooking up with a label mate for some easy publicity. Driver brings furious snapping vigor to her role as a postmodern Mama Rose her prominent jaw seeming to reset with more determination each time Noni dares to challenge her master plan and manipulations. The LAPD cop named Kaz is played by Nate Parker with just the right mix of muscularity and quiet focus. Kaz has his own parental drama in the form of a dad (Danny Glover) with just as many hopes and dreams for his son as Macy has for Noni. (The young man is such a Boy Scout that he steps on one of his own theatrically dramatic moments by insisting Noni put on her seat belt.) Filmed with the lavish invidious production values of an extended music video ""Beyond the Lights"" looks and sounds terrific its images of showbiz luxury and profligacy -- including an eyepopping Beyonce-like performance at the BET Awards -- seducing viewers but also forcing them to question their own tastes for hyper-sexualized often misogynistic images of female artists. Prince-Bythewood cannily has her cake while eating it too by expertly choreographing those familiar strip-tease-like routines only to turn the tables abruptly at the most meaningful moment. She turns the tables yet again when Noni and Kaz make an impulsive decision that literally takes ""Beyond the Lights"" in a new and unexpected direction. Thats also when Mbatha-Raw who starred earlier this year in the costume drama ""Belle"" begins a chameleon-like make-under that not only reinforces Prince-Bythewoods points about identity and integrity but proves how an accomplished actress can make or break a story that by definition teeters perilously on the brink of sheer ridiculousness. Everyone in ""Beyond the Lights"" brings admirable seriousness to otherwise stock roles but it would be for naught without Mbatha-Raws honesty and intensity which result in a star turn as compelling as any this year. The fact that ""Beyond the Lights"" is so effective at both celebrating and critiquing extravagance and artifice can be credited to Prince-Bythewoods shrewd understanding of the highly pitched cinematic vernacular shes working with. Even more crucially when it came time to cast the transformational figure at her fables center she found the real thing.    PG-13. At area theaters.

Photo Suzanne Tenner / Associated Press Beyond the Lights review Film finds a groove thanks to star 1 / 3 Back to Gallery This is turning into a very good year for Gugu Mbatha-Raw. The intimations of stardom that were evident in ""Belle"" come into full blossom in ""Beyond the Lights."" As a work of art the movie is merely on the bright side of OK. But as a vehicle for an emerging star as a platform to show one actress in a variety of modes and moods within a sympathetic and glamorous context it couldnt be better. Another way of saying this is that Mbatha-Raw is the whole picture. Those who invest in her and her journey might end up loving ""Beyond the Lights"" even against their will. Those who resist her and watch the movie at a remove will inevitably be put off by the hamfisted manipulations of character and story -- including that worst of all faults of the movie romance the fake argument that occurs 20 minutes before the finish. Mbatha-Raw plays a newly minted pop star from Britain with Rihanna-like hair extenders and a sexed-up persona. Driven by a fierce stage mother (Minnie Driver) she is on the brink of becoming a huge stateside sensation -- when she gets drunk one night and tries to jump off the hotel balcony. She is saved by a handsome young police officer and ... well if you know Point A you sort of know Point Z. The pleasure is in witnessing all the stages in between. Over the course of the film Mbatha-Raw does many things all of them quite well. Theres a moment early in the film when a fan says ""I love you"" and she looks disturbed as though wondering how that could even be possible. In her dealings with people she has a curious double thing going on a misery laced with pride. She knows shes not happy but she knows she has something others want or think they want. She exudes power without joy. As a singer Mbatha-Raw must deliver the goods as a pop star which she does. Then adopting another style she sings Nina Simones ""Blackbird"" with an emotional commitment thats riveting. And all the while we are tracing her characters up-and-down journey toward finding her own truth as an artist and as a person. Nate Parker has the role of Kaz the heroic police officer and he stays afloat despite a plot that pushes him into behaviors and attitudes that arent consistent and dont quite make sense. As the stage mother riding the gravy train to the right side of the tracks Minnie Driver has an aggression bordering on cruelty -- at least until she and director Gina Prince-Blythewood pull back and look for the human being underneath. Sometimes surfaces are more interesting. There are many little things to complain about if anyone wants to complain. The events that send the pop stars career up and down wouldnt really wreak such strong effects. Theres a stage of fame in which any publicity is either good or doesnt much matter. But these flaws and exaggerations though impossible not to notice are easy enough to ignore when you have Mbatha-Raw onscreen giving it everything shes got.

VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 209 p.m. MST November 13 2014Gina Prince-Bythewoods film asks -- but doesnt really answer -- lots of questions about the price of fame particularly for women. But Gugu Mbatha-Raws performance helps a lot.Minnie Driver (left) nails her role of a domineering stage-mother in ""Beyond the Lights.""(Photo Relativity Media)Story HighlightsCritics review 3 starsThe film asks %u2014 but doesnt answer %u2014 questions about the costs of fame particularly for women.Minnie Driver is quite good as a domineering cold-hearted stage mom.Gugu Mbatha-Raw elevates the movie beyond its sappy story with a good performance.What does it take to become a star?The demands are great particularly for women who must make all kinds of deals with the devil (and themselves) in pursuit of fame. The sexualization of female stars is not exactly a secret but its one that Gina Prince-Bythewoods film ""Beyond the Lights"" seeks to lay bare so to speak.If only the story wasnt so mind-numbingly dumb. (Prince-Bythewood also wrote the script.)Which leads to another question Can a knockout performance make a stupid story worthwhile?""Beyond the Lights"" inadvertently answers that one too. Or more to the point Gugu Mbatha-Raw does.And that answer is yes.More azcentrals newest movie reviewsMbatha-Raw who was so good in ""Belle"" as a mixed-race woman who finds a foothold in 18th-century British society here stars as Noni the Next Big Thing in pop music even though her first album isnt out yet. Shes best known so far as the girlfriend of Kid Culprit (Richard Colson Baker better known as the rapper MGK) on whose songs she appears (and as an object in his ridiculously degrading music videos).She and Kid Culprit win a Billboard award she pops some champagne in the limo on the ride back to the hotel and once there crawls over the ledge and dangles several stories above the street. Shes saved by Kaz (Nate Parker) the LA police officer who saves her by saying ""I see you."" It seems no one else particularly Macy Jean (Minnie Driver) her ambitious mother really does.Related Qamp;A with Beyond the Lights star Nate Parker""Beyond the Lights"" explores the price of fame and Gugu Mbatha-Raw (right) is great in the lead role. (Photo Relativity Media)Macy Jean orchestrates a half-baked story for the press whose Watergate-level coverage of the event would have seemed absurd even a few years ago but in our celebrity-driven culture feels about right. No ones really buying it but the media moves on to the next thing for now.Meanwhile Noni does not. She begins spending time with Kaz who has ambitions of his own. More accurately his father (Danny Glover) a high-ranking LAPD officer has them for him Hes going to be a political star. Like Nonis career its all part of a well-orchestrated plan and this diversion is not what either parent envisioned for them.True love will out and all that.Driver is good as a monster of a mother whom we meet at the beginning of the film smashing the second-place trophy Noni has won in a talent show because its not good enough. Give Prince-Bythewood credit for this She doesnt let Macy Jean off easy. If only that were the case with the rest of the characters; in some ways Macy Jean is the most interesting of all.Related 5 essential Minnie Driver filmsBut this is a movie about fame and its costs and shes just an enabler. Instead we have Kaz and Noni going through the highs and lows of a relationship that -- due to her rising fame and now infamy -- plays out in public. The film soldiers on through a couple of possible endings and if its real destination is never truly in doubt Mbatha-Raw makes the trip interesting.The intelligence she gives Noni makes her compromises all the sadder. But that same intelligence makes the choices she makes -- and the ones made for her -- more compelling. Is she willing to pay the price to become famous? And what exactly will that price be?A movie like ""Beyond the Lights"" is not going to answer that question. It doesnt set out to. But at least Prince-Bythewood brings up the questions and thats a worthy achievement in its own right.AZCENTRALBeyond the Lights (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBeyond the LightsDirector Gina Prince-Bythewood.Cast Gugu Mbatha-Raw Nate Parker Minnie Driver.Rating PG-13 for sexual content including suggestive gestures partial nudity language and thematic elements.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Suzanne Tenner) Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Minnie Driver in Beyond the Lights (Suzanne Tenner) Gugu Mbatha-Raw takes the stage in Beyond the Lights. (Suzanne Tenner) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 13 2014 126 PM Title Beyond the Lights Film Info With Gugu Mbatha-Raw Minnie Driver. Soapy showbiz romance balances sex and smarts. Director Gina Prince-Bythewood (142). PG-13 Sexuality partial nudity language. Area theaters. Look past the generic title the melodramatic premise and even how ""Beyond the Lights"" is basically a soapy update of ""The Bodyguard."" This unusually intelligent crowd-pleaser is welcome proof that quality filmmaking neednt be limited by subject audience or budget. Writer/director Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love amp; Basketball"") spent years pushing to get this project made. And her passion shows. Her ace is little-known actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw (""Belle"") who delivers a star-making turn as a Ciara-style pop singer named Noni. Still managed by her monstrous stage mother (Minnie Driver) Noni is besieged by the trappings of celebrity. Her life is filled with things our culture reveres -- money fame adulation -- and yet she feels totally empty. So one night she steps out on a hotel balcony and tries to leave it all behind. Kaz (Nate Parker a bit bland) a police officer with political aspirations catches her before she falls. With the tabloids following close behind the two of them go searching for something else. This being an escapist fantasy a gorgeous beach in Mexico serves as the first stop. So far so familiar right? Well sure. Weve got a beautiful tormented heroine and her sensitive often-shirtless savior. Theres a juicy villain in her mom and lots of dewy vacation scenery. So the respect that Prince-Bythewood brings to this material feels like a revelation. She wants to entertain us but shes also got some interesting things to say particularly about the roles race and gender play in popular culture. None of this would work without an equally tuned-in lead. Shes certainly got one in Mbatha-Raw who delivers the most nuanced and naturally charismatic performance Ive seen from an actress this year. The rare romance thats simultaneously sexy and smart ""Beyond the Lights"" feels like a rebuke to all the lazy date-night movies and cheesy showbiz sagas before it. Take note Hollywood As of today Prince-Bythewood and Mbatha-Raw should be permanently overemployed. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews beyond the lights gina prince-bythewood gugu mbatha-raw minnie driver nate parker Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

She nails a performance of a Nina Simone classic but the judges give the grand prize to a less deserving girl infuriating her mother Macy Jean (Minnie Driver) who forces Noni to smash the second place prize. Years later Noni is a colorful pop star slinging sex and hip-hop beats to the masses and is on the cusp of a highly anticipated debut album.Feeling suffocated by her superstar life shes ready to jump off the balcony of her luxury hotel suite. Fill-in security guard Kaz (Nate Parker) a police officer on celebrity bodyguard detail heroically intervenes. He agrees to a public relations cover-up that changes her suicide attempt to a drunken escapade.Theres an immediate connection in their meet not-so-cute but complications ensue immediately.Her life is full of photo shoots press interviews a stern manager mom and other demands not to mention her high-profile relationship with hot rapper Kid Culprit (real-life rapper Machine Gun Kelly aka Richard Colson Baker). The more grounded Kaz reintroduces her life to simpler pleasures such as a late-night soul food run. But his political aspirations dont jibe with cavorting with a pop star. Their conflict comes to a head at an explosive BET Awards performance featuring Noni and Kid Culprit (a sequence as undercooked as the unintentionally hilarious Academy Awards sequence in ""The Bodyguard"").Mbatha-Raw continues to be a true revelation in a role that could be not be any more different from her star turn in ""Belle"" this year. Shes matched by the always reliable Parker.In the capable hands of writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (of urban classic ""Love and Basketball"") the feel-good movie works. Prince-Bythewood isnt reinventing the wheel here but she succeeds on a pure entertainment level.What ""Beyond the Lights""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 156  Content Suggestive gestures partial nudity language and thematic elements Kevin C.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres something compellingly kitchen-sink about the opening scenes of Gina Prince-Bythewoods music world melodrama as U.K. stage mom Macy (Minnie Driver) frenetically shuttles her daughter Noni (India Jean-Jacques) from the hairdresser to a local talent show. The gifted young girl takes runner-up for her stirring rendition of Nina Simones ""Blackbird"" but Macy isnt having it and demands Noni toss her trophy to the ground. Her kid can only ever be the best. Nothing less will do. This section has an admirable grit and genuineness especially in the way the restless hand-held camera complements both mother and childs individual anxieties. The mood is almost immediately and intentionally undermined when the film suddenly cuts to a music video in which the grown-up Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) is gyrating alongside bad boy rapper Kid Culprit (Richard Colson Baker a.k.a. Machine Gun Kelly). Its now several years after her second place showing and Noni is a pop diva (purple-dyed weave and all) on the verge of blowing up. But success is more devil than angel; returning to her Hollywood hotel after the latest soul-sucking awards show she climbs over the balcony banister ready to jump. Only by the grace and good grip of moonlighting police officer Kaz (Nate Parker) does she get to live another day. ""I see you"" Kaz says with the kind of empathy and emotion Nonis life has been sorely lacking. Then he pulls her to safety. It must be love.How easy it would be for Beyond The Lights to turn fully bathetic and how wonderful that it mostly maintains the promise of that opening section. Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) does a beautiful job sketching in both Noni and Kazs antithetical milieus her stifling affluence--with its many sycophants paparazzi and exploiters of all stripes--versus his modest blue-collar existence which is governed by a father (Danny Glover) who wants to see his son parlay his pillar-of-the-community aura into a political career. (""Shes not first lady material"" he says to Kaz when its clear hes falling for Noni--as if thatll stop them.) A star-crossed love story is only as good as its Romeo and Juliet. Both Parker and Mbatha-Raw have a sweet smoldering chemistry thats a joy to witness especially after they run off together for a rejuvenating sojourn in Mexico. (Its there that the movies best scene occurs as Noni sings an a cappella solo in front of a rapt karaoke bar audience--a moving act of defiance reclamation and empowerment.) This is feel-good populist entertainment at heart so theres an element of wish fulfillment to how the duos romance plays out that Prince-Bythewood isnt entirely able to sell. She nonetheless works hard to complicate characters--especially Drivers overbearing Macy who in a lesser movie would be a hissing demon. And she unearths plenty of emotional truths that ring resoundingly true notably in regard to the way much of the music industry sells debased and debauched images of women for maximum profit.

Photo Suzanne Tenner MOVIE REVIEW Beyond the Lights Running time 116 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity sexuality). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay the Magic Johnson others The teary-eyed sincerity of the music-industry drama ""Beyond the Lights"" is at times too much but despite its cliche elements the film at least has the feel of a passion project. Its a soapy tale about a poor mixed-race London girl named Noni who pushed by her domineering mother (Minnie Driver) grows up to be a superstar pop singer albeit in the trashy mode of Nicki Minaj. Depressed by the feeling shes betrayed herself she tries to jump off a balcony in the opening minutes only to be rescued by a hunky cop (Nate Parker). As Noni Gugu Mbatha-Raw who earlier this year starred in the period piece ""Belle"" shows every sign of being a big star in the making. She essentially plays dual roles here At times shes a hip-hop force of nature -- a tramp diva whose every move creates a spectacle. But when she dumps her rapper boyfriend plucks out her hair extensions and strips off her makeup shes appealingly down to earth getting back to her torch-song roots by singing a slow Nina Simone tune a cappella. Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Nate Parker.Photo Suzanne Tenner Parkers role is much less showy but he also does subtly fine work as the brainy LAPD officer with political ambitions who for the sake of Nonis image is forced to play along with the fiction that she merely slipped off the balcony she was trying to jump off. The rare Hollywood feature that is written and directed by a woman (Gina Prince-Bythewood) ""Beyond the Lights"" is an obvious middling chick flick that moves far too slowly from each predictable plot point to the next. But with its glitzy showbiz backdrop its lively musical numbers and its theme of self-actualization itll probably connect with fans of ""The Bodyguard.""

All Rights Reserved Tales of fame and its trappings -- and the way theyre never enough to build a life -- are as old as show business itself. Maybe for that reason almost any story about discovering the hollowness of fame is often written off as a cliche. But whats the difference really between cliche and convention? Sometimes the most seemingly conventional stories are the best tools for digging into knotty everyday truths. Gina Prince-Bythewoods Beyond the Lights is a deeply satisfying crowd-pleaser about a young singer Gugu Mbatha-Raws Noni whos on the brink of superstardom but isnt particularly happy about it. A few days before her debut album is set to drop -- and just after shes won a Billboard award for a single she made with a scrawny tattooed white rapper -- she tries to throw herself off her hotel balcony. The mega-handsome young cop assigned to guard her room Nate Parkers Kaz stops her just in time though it takes a little doing. Noni is convinced that no one can seeer; Kaz assures her he can. Their eyes meet and their gaze becomes a kind of pact. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In that early scene you may think you pretty much know where Beyond the Lights is headed. And youre probably right. But that doesnt negate the pleasure of getting there and writer-director Prince-Bythewood -- perhaps best known for Love amp; Basketball her smart provocative picture about a romance between two ambitious athletes -- handles the particulars smoothly. Polished but blessedly un-slick Beyond the Lights opens with a prologue set in South London in 1998. The young Noni (played by India Jean-Jacques) a serious-looking girl with a dark puff of hair is being ferried by a high-strung white woman we assume rightly to be her mom Minnie Drivers Macy Jean. She hustles Noni into a hair salon just as the proprietress is closing up Macy explains her voice taut with desperation that her daughter has an important talent show the next day. What can be done about her hair? The stylist takes a moment to show Macy a trick or two. Later Noni simply but neatly coiffed takes the stage -- shes the only little person of color up there -- and renders a guilelessly red-hot a cappella version of Nina Simones ""Blackbird."" She wins runner-up. Macy furious at the idea of her daughter being only second best makes her throw the trophy away.That scene tells us everything and nothing about how Noni will end up. Prince-Bythewood jettisons her heroine into a future of stretch limos tiny metallic shorts and glossy purple hair (the best weave money can buy) and introduces a smattering of conflict That handsome stalwart nice-guy cop hopes to build a political career and a sex-bomb celebrity like Noni isnt as his dad (Danny Glover) tells him first-lady material. But Prince-Bythewood wraps lots of candid insights some of them quite cutting around these straightforward trappings. In the movies most explosive scene Noni takes the stage at the BET Awards only to surprise the audience (and her overbearing mother now her manager) by refusing to play the shimmying sexpot they expect. Shes humiliated and then struck onstage by that white rapper (played by Richard Colson Baker) whos now her ex. In shaping the story Prince-Bythewood then takes a step that doesnt quite make sense. But the mechanics matter less than the naked pathetic power display -- charged both sexually and racially -- that shes just shown us. This is Prince-Bythewoods way of saying that even long after the Rihanna-Chris Brown gossip has died down the issues at heart havent disappeared and theyre no less troubling.Film Details Beyond the Lights RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time116 More Info Trailer Mbatha-Raw (last seen in Belle based on the true story of a black woman growing up among white aristocracy in 18th-century England) is a captivating presence here look-at-me sexy one moment and soberly vulnerable the next. But she never lets her character descend into raw neediness or histrionic self-loathing. Theres always something sturdy and earthbound about her fragility as if she knows she doesnt have to play the victim even when she feels like one. Nonis triumph doesnt come all at once -- it takes awhile for her to stop fighting her hair and find her voice -- but her moment of epiphany strikes a resounding chord. Maybe it doesnt hurt either that Prince-Bythewoods cinematographer Tami Reiker is a woman Her approach to the movies sex scenes and her mode of looking at both men and women in general is deeply attuned to the pleasures of beauty and movement. A movie isnt a cliche when it can sing like this.Written and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.

For decades Hollywood obliged delivering camp classics that showcased both the shiny bits and the tarnish Valley of the Dolls Funny Girl Mahogany and of course A Star Is Born (all three iterations). Then came the dark times of Glitter Burlesque and other bent cinematic tinsel; even prestige fare like Dreamgirls felt hopelessly retro in an age of gossip blogs and basic-cable confessionals. Beyond the Lights might not single-handedly revive the backstage melodrama on the big screen but the movie manages to drag it defiantly into 2014 while still tapping into all the stuff that was so satisfying about those earlier films. Belles Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars as Noni a Ciara-like singer whose talent takes her from the grim council flats of London to the almost-A-list canyons of Los Angeles. Shes a rising starlet still new to the world of photo shoots top-shelf champagne and chauffeured Escalades with a debut album on the way and a white rapper boyfriend whos famous famous. Then one night after taking home her first prize at an awards show Noni decides to crawl over the railing of her beautiful hotel balcony and let go. Her ruthless mom-slash-manager (Minnie Driver having a ball with her bitchery) doesnt want to know why Nonis sad she just wants a promise that it wont happen again. But the LAPD officer (Nate Parker) who pulls her off the ledge sees the miserable girl underneath and starts to draw her out. Both Mbatha-Raw and Parker are appealing expressive actors and writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) lets them breathe filling in the boilerplate bones of the story with smartly nuanced commentary on race and fame and the relentless negotiations that a young woman--even one without a record deal--has to make in a world that expects her to be everything but herself.

"From Here to Stupidity The Return of Dumb and Dumber; Plus Some New Not-Bad Sentimental Movies << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com From Here to Stupidity The Return of Dumb and Dumber; Plus Some New Not-Bad Sentimental Movies Universal pictures Movies November 14 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print For most of Dumb and Dumber To I didnt know why any of us were there. The movie wanders toward a plot in which Lloyd (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) hit the road to ask Harrys long-lost daughter who had been given up for adoption to give Harry a kidney. There are so many firecracker-type gags that dont go off that its tempting to walk out. Staying is too sad. In the original movie from 20 years ago Carrey had a bowl cut and a cheap newsboy jacket; Daniels wore an electrocuted frizz and a tight striped T-shirt. They were two Muppets terrorizing a live-action world. Now in their fifties (Daniels is 59) wearing the same costumes they seem like mentally ill fugitives from middle age. As it is when this movie starts Lloyd has been catatonic living in a mental institution since the last movie and Harry has been coming by to change his friends diaper. In flashbacks Lloyd lies on a table while Harry yammers on tossing powder between Lloyds hoisted legs the way a TV chef might truss a turkey. The directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly cram the movie with puns and those kinds of sight gags. Almost none of them work. You know that Carrey and the Farrellys can do better because in parts of the first movie and throughout Me Myself amp; Irene they did. This movie is determined to wear down your resistance but its wearying. Having Daniels and two Latin actors playing gardeners yank a catheter out of Carrey might be in the spirit of the original movie but its also an imitation of it. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverage When the Farrellys are at their best you cant predict where a scene will wind up. They excel at the payoff comedy of well-built gags -- say the visit that Ben Stiller pays to Marys mother and stepfather in Theres Something About Mary that culminates in Stillers being wheeled amid total visual chaos into an ambulance. The editing camerawork and blocking worked in tandem to mine maximal hilarity from personal embarrassment. (This rarely happens in American film comedy now; the formal brilliance has mostly migrated to TV.) Occasionally they can build whole movies on an infectious sense of surprise Mary Irene Stuck on You and their underrated infidelity comedy Hall Pass. Dumber To just has moments. For instance when Harry hunts down his daughters birth mother (Kathleen Turner) who had put the child up for adoption she gives him a letter she had sent to the girl that had been returned the envelope unopened. Harry and Lloyd use the address on it to get from Providence to Maryland. But when they show up on the front steps an exasperated Turner opens the door. You idiots this is the return address. Its a happy stupid surprise that rises to the challenge of finding the least-expected route to the biggest laugh. Whats wrong with Dumber To -- after youve accepted that it was made at all -- is that there isnt enough of that. The movie works only when theres that kind of tension between average people and the two idiots. Mistaking Turner for a man or screaming at a blind guy in a wheelchair isnt funny. Letting an old lady manipulate Lloyd into getting her off is in its nasty way -- but only because the joke with the horny old woman is mostly on Lloyd. When Lloyd and Harry show up finally at the mansion of the long-lost daughters adoptive parents the movie reaches a steadier gear. The plot kicks in and the Farrellys who share writing credit with four other men use it to sharpen the jokes. We arrive at the mansion before Harry and Lloyd do and we can see that Harrys daughter Penny (Rachel Melvin) is a nincompoop too -- but a sexy one. (Harry wants her kidney; Lloyd wants her.) The adoptive family is a collection of types. The father is an oldish ailing Nobel Prize-winning scientist Dr. Pinchelow (Steve Tom). The mother is a film-noir blonde (Laurie Holden) with perfect diction and a plan to knock him off. (Holdens impersonation of a B movie femme fatale is the best thing in the film.) Dr. Pinchelow has dispatched Penny to speak on his behalf at a big TED Talk-like technology conference (KEN plays TED) but she has left behind her phone and the mysterious box he needs delivered. The idiots arrive in time to bring the package to Penny complicating the murder plot. This kind of comedy gets somewhere when the grossness and rudeness and idiocy actually have somewhere to go. Here they go to KEN where Harry is mistaken for Pinchelow and eventually treated like a god. The desperate randomness of the jokes dissipates the farce takes hold and the plot twists about three times. I wish I could say it was all worth it. Dumber To is as much beholden to Billy Wilder and James Thurber and John Waters as are the Farrellys other movies but the prevailing cheapness keeps things much too close to the slovenliness of some Kevin Smith comedies. The original movies release 20 years ago happened at the dawn of a new kind of comedic extremity. Dumb and Dumber along with Ren amp; Stimpy and Beavis and Butt-Head -- scandalous cartoon cable shows -- set a new standard for violent foolish friendships.1 Lloyd and Harry were live-action Looney Tunes. You dont watch a movie like Kingpin or Shallow Hal and think that the men who made it are cool. The Farrellys have an honest geeky curiosity about the true bounds of bad taste. They explore it in movies that feel like old slapstick TV -- The Three Stooges with blood and puke and all kinds of scatological foulness. Whats appalling about them also warrants affection. They like people. The Farrellys are as soft-hearted as they are filthy. Even so Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne just werent people you needed to see again. Their return reflects a will in Hollywood and probably in the public to reinvest in Carreys tarnished stardom. Prolonged exposure might have anesthetized us to his brilliance. Hes flailing here swinging hard at every pitch in the script. Daniels gets to be funnier than he did in the first movie. But in the intervening decades he has also become a stronger more textured actor. So the hurt sticks to him and hes crazy enough to play it. The movie just isnt funny enough to make you happy that he bothered. Its made of exactly what flies off of Lloyds hand after he removes it from under that old ladys sheet dust.  Everything about the Farrellys movie is old-fashioned including the kind of mess it is. Its a big moment for corniness at the movies. At the heart of Christopher Nolans Interstellar is the eternally corny notion that love is all you need. But theres nothing inherently wrong with sentimentality or earnestness. It can tip a film into a new or unexpected place. A handful of movies rolling out this weekend are robustly corny and theyre as proud of that as Nolans movie is. If for instance you left Jon Stewarts Rosewater feeling it was made out of duty you wouldnt be wrong. Five years ago the Iranian journalist Maziar Bahari was jailed for being a traitor. The Iranian authorities case against him included his appearance on Stewarts The Daily Show where it was concluded he must have been communicating with an American spy. The film is based on a memoir that Bahari wrote with Aimee Molloy and stars a charm-soaked Gael Garcia Bernal. Its focused largely on the 118 days that Bahari spent imprisoned and interrogated but it is really a work of personal journalism with ripples of comedy and magical realism. Mostly the shifts in tone are muted. Whenever Stewart who wrote the screenplay cracks a joke the mood of solemnity is shattered and youre grateful for the break. The levity feels somehow natural -- not to Stewart per se but to the existential absurdity of the situation. Most of the time the comedy involves Kim Bodnia whos excellent as the blindfolded Baharis fragrant interrogator (the title comes from the heavys scent). The film goes slightly beyond rigorous earnestness and settles into a kind of stubborn atonement. If Stewart feels culpable for Baharis harsh treatment a movie about the consequences of his visit to the show might be the least he felt he could do. But the film is well made and well meaning enough to leave you convinced that Stewart can do even more.  Blackbird Productions/Suzanne Tenner All of the ""more"" in Beyond the Lights comes from the movies belief that the music business preys on womens sexuality until the women dont know who they are anymore. The rising star in Gina Prince-Bythewoods drama is a dancing half-black half-white British singer named Noni (Gugu Mbatha-Raw). Shes been mixed up with a white rapper (Machine Gun Kelly). Her mother (Minnie Driver) has been stage-managing her since her first singing competition. The lack of autonomy nearly sends her over a balcony. Thank goodness that a fine -- and I mean ""foine"" -- LAPD officer (Nate Parker) is there to catch her and pull her up. What ensues is a crowd-pleasing romance between a pair of young black people who together are trying to regain control of their lives (his dad -- Danny Glover -- has pushed him into a campaign for elected office). The story and the concert sequences creak -- theyre part addictive TV drama part Bodyguard redux -- but Prince-Bythewood loves these two people even more than they love each other. She gets them away from the crazy pressures of her mother and the paparazzi and sends them to Mexico where a sexy version of Roman Holiday commences. This leads to a major change in hair and artistic sensibility. Noni goes from Ciara or Aaliyah to Corinne Bailey Rae. Prince-Bythewood has more to say about artistic authenticity than anything in Begin Again; her film is more interesting than it is good. But if ""interesting"" includes 50 alluring close-ups of Parker giving hungry eyes to Mbatha-Raw then ""good"" is overrated.  Roadside Attractions The Homesman could have been great. Its a drama about a homesteader named Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) who agrees to transport three mentally ill women (Grace Gummer Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter) from Nebraska to Iowa in a horse-drawn coach with jail bars. The movie has an Oz-like hook. Mary Bee happens upon a hanging man (Tommy Lee Jones) who begs her to cut him down. She does so on the condition that he help her transport these women. Hes a noxious chauvinist. But on they go with assorted bumps -- and parts for Meryl Streep John Lithgow and James Spader -- along the way. I was taken with this arid movie which Jones directs with sugarless confidence. Its Brittle House on the Prairie a tribute to femininity and its misapprehensions. This noble lonely woman feels entitled to companionship and is quietly sour that at 35 and with means she has yet to experience it. Swank continues to be the most guilelessly corny star the movies have. Everything she does is in the service of one shape square. And Jones is smart enough not to overdo any punched-up sentimentality toward her. At this point he must know that the situation is pretty much Pavlovian. Your eyes get wet just looking at her. Jones is good in this film too and youre nervous that hell take it over. But then the plot turns and asks something of Mary Bee that is a complete betrayal of Swanks performance and the radiance she emits. The development probably works in Glendon Swarthouts novel of the same name where Swank is nowhere in sight. But not in the theater. Youre tempted to give up on the movie because it feels as if the movie has given up on her.

As the stunned deer in the headlights of fame Gugu Mbatha-Raw is incandescent playing a vulnerable young woman suffocating in the processed packaging of a sizzling pop goddess. Strong chemistry with co-star Nate Parker and a pulsing soundtrack should help give this November Relativity release a legitimate commercial shot. Predictable or not its easy to shove aside all thoughts of guilty pleasure and just succumb to these behind-the-glittery-curtain sagas when theres as much heart and feeling as writer-director Prince-Bythewood (Love amp; Basketball) injects into her material. But the big surprise here is Mbatha-Raw who turned heads this year in the period drama Belle. The emerging Brit actress proves shes equally captivating in the very contemporary drag of a booty-shaking Beyonce-Rihanna clone selling sex with a pumped-up Ramp;B beat. The film opens in London in 1998 where white Brixton single mum Macy Jean (Driver) guides her shy black 10-year-old daughter Noni (India Jean-Jacques) through a talent contest. Noni comes in second with an unaccompanied performance of Nina Simones plaintive ""Blackbird"" but that represents failure for hungry Macy. She tells the compliant kid to toss the trophy hissing ""You wanna be a runner-up? Or you wanna be a winner?"" Prince-Bythewood amusingly navigates a leap forward in time by cutting to an aggressively sexual music video for ""Masterpiece"" one of three back-to-back hits that the adult Noni (Mbatha-Raw) has recorded with superstar white rapper Kid Culprit (Colson ""MGK"" Baker). The awkward bespectacled girl with the tangled mop of hair has been transformed into a strutting gazelle with a toned body a flowing weave and a micro wardrobe. The song wins a Billboard Award but when Noni returns to her Beverly Hills hotel she attempts a suicide dive off her 12th floor balcony and is rescued by Kaz (Parker) an LAPD hunk on celebrity-babysitting duty. Macy now running a tight ship as Nonis manager goes into instant spin mode. At a press conference the incident is brushed off as the accidental result of too many celebratory drinks and Kaz is hailed as a hero. But despite receiving a fat check as payment for sticking to the story the cop is too sensitive a brother not to feel Nonis pain. And she likes that he sees beyond the fame to the soulful girl inside. Theres a somewhat schematic neatness to Noni and Kaz both being driven by single parents who want success for their children at least partly for their own vicarious glory. In Kazs case its his father Police Captain Nicol (Danny Glover) who has helped him strategize a career path in which law enforcement is the stepping stone between political science and actual politics starting with Los Angeles city council and then moving up to bigger things. Romance with a train-wreck pop tart is not part of the plan. With the label threatening to drop Nonis debut album due to negative social media attention its imperative that she kick ass -- or at the very least show some -- in a live performance at the BET Awards. But Kazs lesson of self-worth (he reads Obama books and wears Muhammad Ali T-shirts) prompts her to rebel which doesnt sit well with skeevy Kid Culprit with Macy or with the label. Pretty much every development here is preprogrammed from countless films about the meteoric rise to stardom the lack of oxygen up there and the good-lovin angel who steps in to light the way back down to Earth. But Prince-Bythewoods script brings surprising integrity to that well-trodden arc and while Kaz is a major force in Nonis outcome its her own backbone and intelligence that get her through. It may be obvious but watching her remove her fake nails and weave and set free the realness within is quite moving. Economy is not exactly a strong point here and at just under two hours the film at times lingers where it should glide pausing for at least a couple too many music montages. But these are appealing characters to spend time with and both Mbatha-Raw and Parker bring warmth charisma and emotional openness to their roles that keeps you rooting for them to reconcile their conflicted paths. Even Drivers character has her brittle edges softened enough to stop her from being a monster. The film looks and more important sounds sharp. Cool grooves pepper the soundtrack and the handful of songs for Noni written by Terius ""The-Dream"" Nash and Richard C. Baker mimic the vernacular of todays overproduced Ramp;B convincingly enough to make it credible that everyone wants a piece of her. If the ultimate message is that young female pop stars may have far more depth than their synthetic performance image suggests that wont stop the demographic for those artists from enjoying this movie.

"Beyond the Lights Review Gugu Mbatha-Raw Shines in Music-Biz Satire | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Toronto Film Review Beyond the Lights Andrew Barker Senior Features Writer barkerrant 2 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr September 8 2014 | 1214AM PT Gugu Mbatha-Raw gives a fierce lead turn in Gina Prince-Bythewoods messy but undeniably entertaining music-biz romance. ""Beyond the Lights"" is a strange beast a music-industry romance that alternates freely between wisdom and mawkishness caustic entertainment-biz critique and naive wish fulfillment heartfelt flourishes and soap-opera shenanigans. Yet writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood (""Love and Basketball"") nonetheless manages to fit all the warring elements of her screenplay into an undeniably entertaining attractive package buoyed by a fierce lead performance from Gugu Mbatha-Raw as a burgeoning pop star and Nate Parker as the cop who saves her from suicide. Given the proper handling this Nov. 14 Relativity release could well be a sleeper. Inauspiciously the film begins with a prologue set in the late 1990s as frizzy-haired British grade schooler Noni (India Jean-Jacques) delivers a beautiful a cappella rendition of Nina Simones ""Blackbird"" at a talent competition. She winds up in second place but is ordered to smash the offending trophy by her tart-tongued council-flat stage mom (Minnie Driver) who asks ""Do you wanna be a runner-up or do you want to be a winner?"" Harsh maybe but it sure worked out well for Joe Jackson and Murry Wilson. Flash forward to the present day and the adult Noni (Mbatha-Raw) has fashioned herself into a lubricious Rihanna-Katy Perry hybrid perpetually decked out with stripper gear and a purple weave. Though her debut album has yet to drop Noni has already racked up several hits alongside her louche rapper boyfriend Kid Culprit (Colson ""Machine Gun Kelly"" Baker) and all eyes are on her as she slinks through a hotel to her penthouse suite after an awards show. Once out of sight however she heads straight to the balcony and hoists herself onto the railing. Kaz (Nate Parker) the earnest young LAPD officer assigned to guard her room swoops into action using his empathetic instincts and his statuesque musculature to pull her back to safety. The two lock eyes for a moment but soon the armies of assistants and handlers are on damage control and Kaz is bribed into towing the official line at a subsequent press conference insisting that Noni simply slipped. Both opening sequences are poised on the very precipice of overheated melodrama but things start to get more interesting in the aftermath. Kaz who is being groomed to make a run for local political office by his father (Danny Glover) cant get Noni out of his mind and keeps seeking excuses to work his way back into her orbit. Noni whose depression and brush with death are viewed in strictly PR-based terms by those around her (including her mother now serving as a Machiavellian business manager) sees in Kaz the rare hanger-on who isnt also on the take. Ditching Nonis battalion of escorts the two abscond for a chaste date of drive-through fried chicken and romance begins to hesitantly bloom. Its to Prince-Bythewoods credit that for all their obvious chemistry Kaz and Nonis relationship always feels both precarious and improbable. Kaz worries what being paparazzi-stalked in the company of a star whose music he accurately describes as ""face-down ass-up"" will do to his political endorsements as well as recognizing his own easy disposability should Nonis mood take a swing. Noni wonders how such a Boy Scout-like cop could possibly handle the constant ethical hedging of the music biz. ""Beyond the Lights"" is enjoyable but frustrating the type of film that seems to repeatedly win its audience over with one scene only to lose it with the next. For example the angles from which Prince-Bythewood shoots the lonely Noni in her cavernous antiseptic mansion speak much louder than say a scene of her smashing the framed magazine covers that adorn her walls yet the director includes a scene of the latter all the same. At times her view of the record industry has an insiders wry knowingness and at others shell have some oily label head bellow ""If she doesnt kick ass at the BET Awards well drop her from the label"" (The less said about the double shot of schmaltz that ends the film the better.) Yet when she gets it right its hard to hold the films shortcomings against her. Gauzy fairy-tale elements aside the pic tackles a number of tough issues with rather admirable directness the default hyper-sexualization of female musicians the entertainment industrys disinterest in the mental health of its prime assets as long as the show goes on and the way a genuine gesture of humanity can be subtly sullied the moment it becomes a media opportunity. A scene in which Noni takes out her hair extensions and scrubs off the anime makeup is unexpectedly empowering and her seduction of a blindfolded Kaz on a private jet while Beyonces ""Drunk in Love"" plays is both incongruously sweet and about as steamy as the PG-13 rating allows. Mbatha-Raw who attracted her first waves of admirers with this springs ""Belle"" is equally superb here believably crafting a thoroughly modern synthetic pop star without losing track of the organic human beneath. Parker makes for a perfectly decent if at times overly decorative foil while Driver brings some humanity to a part that could have easily slipped into outright villainy. The pics tech package is appropriately fizzy and crisp. Ramp;B hitmaker Terius ""The-Dream"" Nash composes a handful of porno-chic pop songs for Mbatha-Raw to sing; as with the collected works of Spinal Tap the faux tunes are catchy and only a degree or two more ridiculous than whats presently on the radio.

Cheryl P says November 16 2014 at 709 pm Saw ""Beyond the Lights"" twice the first time at a pre-screening and yesterday (Sat.). Outstanding movie The acting is superb as is the directing. This is a great date night movie as I would classify it as a romantic drama but it has humor too. The story is about a soon-to-be superstar whos singing career has begun to take off. Only she feels empty inside as she feels compelled by her stage mother played by the excellent Minnie Driver and the pop music industry as a whole to present a very sexualized image to the public while donning very very skimpy attire. The beautiful Gugu Mbatha-Raw is an extremely gifted actress and her portrayal of Noni Jean is stunning in its excellence and heartbreaking at the same time. Sparks are ignited on screen between Gugu and the talented Nate Parker who portrays the handsome and heroic police officer who comes to her rescue. This movie couldnt be more timely especially as we live in an age whereby many young beautiful female stars feel they have to ""bare all"" or nearly all to stay competitive. Just a caution to parents this movie is rated PG-13 but probably just barely. Would not take children under 13 to see as there are some very spicy scenes as well as mature themes in this movie. Loved ""Beyond the Lights"" and highly recommend Reply E. Selby says September 17 2014 at 1231 pm I just view a special screening of the movie last night and I must say it was a good movie. Im not sure if this is Amarees first directorial debut but he did a very good job with this flick. The cast was good and the two primary actors did a very good job in their respective roles. Overall I think the flick will do well.
