Posted August 4 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Teen sweethearts (Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe) offer a he said/she said history of their courtship in the 1950s nostalgiafest Flipped based on a popular young-adult novel. Despite having one of the genres classics (1986s Stand by Me) on his resume director Rob Reiner turns this coming-of-age story into a clumsy mash of tired golden-oldie vignettes and overheated drama. Worse he vacuum-seals it all in a patronizingly wholesome package like an extended episode of The Wonder Years with all the wonder sucked out.

"Movie review Flipped wears its heart on its sleeve washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Flipped Movie review Flipped wears its heart on its sleeve Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 10 2010 In ""Flipped"" eighth-grader Juli Baker likes eighth-grader Bryce Loski. Bryce on the other hand thinks Juli is annoying. Halfway through Rob Reiners syrupy ham-fisted paean to puppy love you just might start to agree with Bryce. Come to think of it hes a little annoying too. Your reaction to some degree depends on your tolerance for cute child actors. In the lead roles spunky Madeline Carroll (""The Spy Next Door"") and dreamy Callan McAuliffe (an Australian making his American feature debut) have a well-scrubbed middle-of-the-road appeal but for anyone looking for depth even their industrial-strength charm wears thin before long. At times the movie feels like a commercial for Wonder Bread stretched to feature length. The films title is a play on words. On one level it refers to the crush Juli has on Bryce. Since the summer before second grade when his family moved in across the street she has been crazy about him. On another level it refers to the films central plot shift. At one point after Bryce has ignored Julis feelings once too often making yet another insensitive comment she comes to the realization that hes a big fat jerk. At which point he starts mooning over her. Their feelings for each other flip-flop get it? But the title has yet another meaning. Based on the 2001 teen romance by author Wendelin Van Draanen which alternated between chapters told in Bryces voice and chapters told in Julis voice ""Flipped"" also switches between narration by each of its protagonists. Unfortunately what seems like it might be a clever idea in a book doesnt entirely work on film. Rather than adding humor paradox or irony to the telling the dueling he-said she-said voice-overs for the most part rehash what weve just seen making the narrative seem twice as long as necessary. In other words the voice-overs often merely explain what were already watching on screen ""I walked home"" Bryce tell us in one of many statements of the obvious ""with the dirty dishes clanking in the picnic basket."" Set in 1963 each new ""chapter"" is introduced with a tone-setting snippet of music taken from a period pop song ""A Teenager in Love"" here ""I Know (You Dont Love Me No More)"" there. After a while even that gimmick starts to feel intrusive and heavy-handed. And speaking of heavy-handed there are a couple of downer subplots that at times threaten to swamp the little film in a tsunami of bathos. One scene in which Juli and her father (Aidan Quinn) visit her developmentally disabled Uncle Daniel is particularly hard to watch. As Daniel -- played by Kevin Weisman channeling Nathan Lane -- freaks out over spilled ice cream the film veers wildly if only momentarily off course. Anthony Edwards also makes an especially unpleasant appearance as Bryces dour judgmental father. Whether hes fulminating at the dinner table about the state of the Bakers lawn or giving Bryces older sister (Cody Horn) the back of his hand for talking back he comes across like someone who wandered onto the wrong soundstage by mistake. Perhaps from the Neil LaBute film next door. He brings a jarring touch to a movie with the look -- and all the subtlety -- of a Norman Rockwell painting sprung to life. Rating one and half stars PG. At area theaters. Contains two mild obscenies a brief slapping scene and shots of a snake eating a raw egg which is kind of gross. 90 minutes.

"Flipped | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; flipped ) Flipped (United States 2010) September 12 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Flipped is Rob Reiners best film in 18 years and includes echoes of two of his most accomplished efforts The Sure Thing and Stand By Me. It also may be 2010s best romantic comedy. And it is being buried by Warner Brothers because of a concern theres no audience for it. Its impossible to judge whether the films distributors are correct - tepid box office results often occur when a movies release date is staggered and juggled and when the marketing campaign is almost non-existent. The bottom line is that many who might be interested in Flipped will be unaware of its here-now/gone-tomorrow release and will have to wait for the DVD. The sad thing is Reiner has struggled for nearly two decades to get back to the level he was at in the late-80s and early 90s and now that hes achieved it no one seems to care. Flipped is a ""pre-sexual"" romantic comedy meaning that it involves a crush between two pre-teen children during an era (the late 1950s and early 1960s) when kids their age were not overexposed to sex and sexual imagery. Reiners perspective may be one of forced innocence but it works. By deleting hormones and desire from the equation Reiner can construct a story based purely on an idealized version of young love. The feelings these characters experience will be familiar to anyone who endured a grade school crush especially when the attachment was not reciprocal. The term ""flipped"" relates the change in a young persons feelings for a member of the opposite sex from hate to love (or vice versa). Its the moment when a boy stops regarding a girl as pest and sees her as someone worth spending time with or the instance when a girl loses interest in pursuing a boy and begins viewing his immaturity as a flaw rather than an asset. In keeping with the title Reiner ""flips"" the viewpoint at various times throughout the movie presenting events from both the boys and girls perspectives. Initially this comes across as an artificial way to advance the narrative but after the first few changes it turns out to be a legitimate and effective way to relate both sides. Reiner is not the first director to employ this non-standard approach to conveying a story but Flipped is one of the more successful examples of it. Its 1957 and second grader Bryce Loski (Ryan Ketzer) has moved into a new house with his mother Patsy (Rebecca De Mornay); father Steven (Anthony Edwards); and sister Lynetta. He is immediately approached by his new neighbor seven-year old Juli Baker (Morgan Lily) who is captivated by his eyes. Bryce is desperate to avoid this girl but she is relentless and shadows him all through grade school and into junior high when the story picks up again after a break of several years. By the time Juli (now played by Madeline Carroll) and Bryce (Callan McAuliffe) have reached seventh grade the situation has grown extreme with Julis signs of affection obvious and Bryce facing derision because of them. But then a strange thing happens. Just as Bryce begins to discover that he may have feelings for Judi she reacts to some of his negative comments and actions and turns cool toward him. Both of them flip almost simultaneously. Flipped draws on nostalgia for much of its power - not only recollections of what the world was like during the middle decades of the 20th century but of how infatuation crushes and interaction with members of the opposite sex work when youre young. Although the characters are 12 and the content is suitable for a family audience Flipped is designed primarily for older viewers. It gains its effectiveness through a retrospective perspective. Prepubescent viewers may sense less in common with Juli and Bryce than one might expect. Although some aspects of youth are constant across the years others - in particular those that relate to male/female relationships - shift as cultural norms change and society has altered a great deal in the past 50 years. For his leads Reiner has selected talented but little-known actors. Madeline Carroll whose performance is nuanced and expressive has an extensive television resume but this is the first feature film in which she has been given a starring part. Her highest-profile previous endeavor was as Kevin Costners daughter in Swing Vote. Meanwhile Callan McAuliffe arrives with fewer titles on his filmography than Carroll but he is equal to the task of sharing the screen with her. He also has no difficulties with an American accent (hes Australian). The supporting roles of parents and other adults are filled by familiar faces although not necessarily household names. Bryces parents are played by Rebecca De Mornay who has aged while we werent looking from a twentysomething femme fatale into convincing stereotypical mother and ex-ER mainstay Anthony Edwards. Julis Mom and Dad are Penelope Ann Miller who was on the verge of entering the A-list during the early 1990s and Aidan Quinn who has kept his name afloat throughout the decades. John Mahoney who spent more than ten years in weekly television on Frasier plays Bryces grandfather. Perhaps Flipped is an ideal direct-to-DVD movie - it has no ""big"" stars and features themes and ideas that will most appeal to a demographic that has largely deserted multiplexes in favor of home video. In a way thats sad because this kind of filmmaking reminds us of the power of motion pictures to touch minds hearts and memories. If it cant find an audience and its distributor cant figure out how to market it what hope is there for more like this? Flipped will reward those who can find it whether in theaters or during a post-multiplex life.

Warner Bros. Pictures CALLAN McAULIFFE as Bryce in Castle Rock Entertainments coming-of-age romantic comedy ""Flipped"" Before it was a television series about first love in a 60s suburb ""The Wonder Years"" was a catch phrase for a brand of white bread. That bland staple would be a suitable accompaniment to the medium-rare romance in ""Flipped."" Rob Reiners revisit to the turf he surveyed in the superior ""Stand By Me"" is so misty-eyed it makes ""Happy Days"" seem like ""All in the Family.""Out of a fuzzy fondness for his past Reiner has taken a contemporary young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen and transported it to the period from 1957 to 1963. At age 7 tow-headed Bryce Loski moves with his family to an idyllic Midwestern neighborhood where hes immediately seized upon by tomboy Juli Baker. Bryce (Callan McAuliffe) tells us in teen voice-over that he tried to avoid Juli (Madeline Carroll) for the next six years during which she fought to save the neighborhood sycamore tree and regularly brought the Loskis farm-fresh eggs. Her forthrightness provokes the scorn of Bryce and his snobbish father (Anthony Edwards). But when Bryces grandfather (John Mahoney) learns that the Bakers are poor because they are supporting a mentally handicapped uncle the old man and the feisty girl become pals and Bryce sees her in a new light. The title of the movie refers not only to being smitten but to the periodic flipping of the point of view from Bryces to Julies. Although its not quite clear why she mistakes this dullard for a dreamboat the crossed wires generate a pleasant hum in tune with the too-familiar 50s music.""Flipped"" is as phony as a poodle-skirted waitress at a mall diner yet its as sweet as a malt.

Most of the movie unfolds while the two are in eighth grade back in 1963. (Warner Bros. Pictures) by Carrie Rickey Film Critic Twitter icon carrierickey Close icon Carrie Rickey Film Critic Mail icon carriedrickeygmail.com Twitter icon carrierickey As Bryce tells it from the moment his family moved to the new neighborhood that pesky Juli from across the street has stalked him. More about Flipped >> As Juli tells it since first she clapped eyes on Bryce when they were 7 she felt they had an important mutual connection. Is one of them delusional? Are they in parallel universes? Or does the world really look that different from anothers perspective especially when were talking adolescent boys and girls? Rob Reiners Flipped a warmhearted teenage he said/she said shifts the action of Wendelin Van Draanens 2003 young-adult novel back to 1963. While this has the effect of making it seem like ancient history to todays teens the time shift underlines the storys timelessness People change and so do first impressions. Most of the movie unfolds while Bryce and Juli are in eighth grade which by definition means they occupy parallel universes. By this time Bryce begins to appreciate Julis individualism and resourcefulness and Juli begins to regard Bryce as a conformist without much depth. The films triple-entendre title alludes to such flips in opinion to the flips in the films point-of-view and to ""flipped"" verb past tense as in falling for someone. Because the film shows its important dramatic moments from first Bryces and then Julis perspective it meanders rather than rushes forward. Reiner who made the similarly themed The Sure Thing about opposites who repel and attract is a most sympathetic director of actors. Madeline Carroll (previously Kevin Costners wise daughter in Swing Vote) is wonderfully relatable as Juli who stages a campaign to save the neighborhood sycamore tree and hatches chicks for her science project. She may not be as pretty as her schools most popular girls but she has a blazing intelligence that sets her apart. When Bryce parroting his father (Anthony Edwards) casually makes fun of her weedy yard its as if hes snuffed out her fire. Callan McAuliffe a handsome Australian youth looks right as the perma-press Bryce who unlike Juli would rather fit in than stand out. The movie nicely contrasts Julis family values sacrificing to take care of the less fortunate with those of Bryces status-conscious clan. As Julis parents Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller are affecting likewise John Mahoney and Rebecca de Mornay as Bryces grandfather and mother. As Bryces snobby Dad Edwards is less nuanced than the other performers. Will Julis first crush lead to her first kiss? Or as is so often the case with teen girls who mature sooner than boys their age will she evolve beyond Bryce? The soundtrack heavy on the Everly Brothers might appeal less to teens than to their grandparents who will likely also enjoy the nostalgic clothes furnishings and the evocation of a world where chirps come from birds and not cell phones. Sharp-eyed viewers of a certain age will recognize that the street where Juli and Bryce live Bonnie Meadow is the same name as the Petries lane in The Dick Van Dyke Show created by Reiners father Carl itself named for the New Rochelle thoroughfare where once the Reiner family lived.

"Flipped Girlz are icky and boyz are stoopid | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFlipped Girlz are icky and boyz are stoopidRob Reiners early 1960s childhood romance plays more like a TV sitcom than a movie but he introduces two talented young actors.Callan McAuliffe and Madeline Carroll star in Flipped.  (BEN GLASS / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 26 2010 Flipped (out of 4) Starring Madeline Carroll Callan McAuliffe Anthony Edwards Rebecca De Mornay Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller. Directed by Rob Reiner. At theatres throughout the GTA. 130 minutes. PG They dont make many movies like Flipped anymore and thats because when they do theyre usually presented as TV sitcoms. Which is really all this first-kiss nostalgia wallow is resting midway between Leave It to Beaver and Malcolm in the Middle on the ""gee whillikers"" to ""life sucks"" continuum. Chances are it would never have seen the drawn curtains of a movie theatre were it not the pet project of Rob Reiner the director and co-writer (with Andrew Scheinman) whose Castle Rock Entertainment bankrolled the production. Reiner is light years away from the scathing satire of such earlier films as When Harry Met Sally... and This Is Spinal Tap. Hes lost all interest in the well-turned jibe and the comic thrust preferring to blandly relive the boyish infatuations of his idyllic youth. (Reiners assistant director is one Frank Capra III incidentally and the family crop of Capra-corn is still high and rising.) Reiner dials Wendelin Van Draanens contemporary teen novel back to the pre-Beatles early 1960s. The story is set in a rural Michigan town where the kids are more likely to listen to the Everly Brothers Johnny Mathis and the Chiffons than to anything remotely rocking. The whole thing would go down like a peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich were it not for the lively lead presence of Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe two young talents who make the movie better than it deserves to be. They can hope for better gigs to come. Shes the tomboyish Juli; hes the gutless Bryce. The two meet as youngsters in the 1957 prologue when Bryce moves into Julis neighborhood and hes frightened by her forthright behavior. Ewww girls By the time the two are in Grade 8 an uneasy truce has been forged through what Bryce calls ""a half-decade of strategic avoidance."" They like each other sorta but Bryce is wary of Julis constant mooning over his dreamy eyes. Still he wonders why he feels all confused and googly-eyed whenever hes around her. An ace at stating the obvious Bryce tells us all this through an incessant voiceover he stares with Juli as the pair take turns describing their differing views of events weve just witnessed. The kids at least seem real a blessing not bestowed on most of the adult characters in Flipped. Bryces parents (Anthony Edwards and Rebecca De Mornay) are dream-killing snobs who worry more about their casseroles and cocktails than their sons tender heart and twitchy pants. They live with a crusty but lovable granddad (John Mahoney) whom you just know will impart some folksy wisdom. Julis parents (Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller) are eccentrics born too soon to be called hippies. They raise chickens and collect eggs to make ends meet and neglect to cut their front lawn. Theyre short on cash because theyre paying for the pricy institutional care of dads beloved brother (Kevin Weisman) who is mentally challenged. As the soundtrack drones on with soft pop and doo-wop Flipped takes its sweet time in getting to the issue of whether Juli and Bryce are meant to be together in any meaningful fashion. This is perhaps a good thing since we dont need a Grade 8 love story that could give both censors and parents heartburn. We do need to see more of young Carroll and McAuliffe however and preferably without the Everly Brothers as musical accompaniment.

(Glass/Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday August 27 2010 400 AM Title Flipped Midway through ""Flipped"" a movie that feels much longer than its 88 minutes you may start to wonder what went wrong. Did director Rob Reiner faced with too much bland footage simply decide to slap things together as best he could? Or did he choose the wrong source material to begin with? Because theres barely half a film here stretched and pulled so thin you can nearly see through it.The story based on Wendelin Van Draanens young adult novel is as simple as it gets In late 1950s suburbia Bryce Loski (Callan McAuliffe) moves in across the street from Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll). Though theyre barely in second grade she falls in love immediately and spends the next several years pursuing her increasingly annoyed neighbor.Right around junior high though she starts developing a social conscience and intellectual curiosity that pull her away from her immature crush. Now of course he wants to get closer. But he has no idea how to approach the brainy girl he once knew so well.Aside from an ill-judged interlude about Julis mentally challenged uncle theres nothing unusual or even particularly compelling in the script by Reiner and Andrew Scheinman. As a result they rely on excessive - and uninteresting - narration to cover all the gaps in onscreen action.Carroll is such a lovely confident actress that she still manages to create a character we care about. McAuliffe however barely registers - a major drawback for a film centered around his apparently irresistible charisma.And while Anthony Edwards and Aidan Quinn do try hard to flesh out the parental roles Penelope Ann Miller and Rebecca De Mornay are disappointingly bland as the kids moms.Adults inclined toward nostalgia will appreciate the period soundtrack and clothing as well as the gentle innocence the movie effectively emphasizes. But if you really want to reminisce simply reach back into Reiners own catalogue Tweens and adults alike will find the mysteries of childhood captured more deftly in ""Stand by Me"" and a wiser wittier romance in ""The Princess Bride.""eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Director Rob Reiner established himself as an adept director of coming-of-age tales with 1986s Stand by Me. He also showed his chops in romantic comedy with 1989s When Harry Met Sally. But much of his subsequent work including Alex and Emma (2003) and The Bucket List(2007) has been disappointing. This effort lies somewhere in the middle. It tries to mine similar territory as Stand by Mes blend of pain and poignance and When Harry Met Sallys serio-comic transition from friends to something more. Its nice to see Reiner return to form with this tale of tween romance set against a backdrop of more complex and troubling adult issues. The tale of first love however is more clever and involving told and retold from the different perspectives of each party than the bigger family problems which are clumsily introduced then left unresolved. Its middle-school romance told Rashomon style recalling that Japanese classics pioneering technique of showing differing accounts of the same events. But while Reiner faithfully brings Wendelin Van Draanens 2001 young-adult novel to the screen he changed her present-day setting to the early 1960s. Perhaps he was trying to appeal to a Baby Boomer audience bolstering the nostalgia with a bland classic-rock soundtrack. Juli (Madeline Carroll) is in second grade when she moves with her family into a suburban Michigan neighborhood and develops a crush on the boy across the street Bryce (Callan McAuliffe). When shes not trying to get Bryce to play with her shes off climbing trees raising chickens and with entrepreneurial verve selling eggs to neighbors. Bryce explains in voiceover that he has strategically avoided Julis attentions over the years. But as he has matured he begins to feel guilty in eighth grade when other kids make fun of her. A budding friendship leads to affection. Reiner develops his young characters with depth and compassion. The same cannot be said for their parents. Like the TV sets of that era its a fairly black-and-white picture Julis parents (Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller) are kindly artistic renters and Bryces mom and dad are snide superficial homeowners. His strained relationship with his overbearing father (Anthony Edwards) and socially striving mother (Rebecca De Mornay) is mitigated somewhat by his more laid-back grandfather (John Mahoney). But when Bryces father does something shockingly abusive the story thread is simply dropped leaving the audience confused and shaken. Edwards is such an odd casting choice so intently playing against type that he comes off as an extreme caricatured villain. The uneven pacing -- exacerbated by playing so many scenes over twice -- further hampers the smooth course of their love. McAuliffe and Carrolls honest performances are the heart of the film. They sound like real kids and its hard to keep from rooting for them. If only the adults had stayed out of it.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Sweet smartly acted and charmingly old-fashioned ""Flipped is a minor pleasure that will strike a lot of moviegoers -- those who think no one makes movies for them anymore -- as a major treat. Its a middle-school romance with appeal on both ends of the age spectrum and it represents a collision of early- and late-period Rob Reiner The filmmaker with a knack for achingly life-sized Hollywood humanity (""The Sure Thing ""Stand By Me ""When Harry Met Sally. . .) and the man who cant direct his way out of a paper bag (""Rumor Has It . . . ""The Bucket List).Two relative newcomers play the leads Madeline Carroll (""The Spy Next Door) as Juli Baker and Callan McAuliffe as Bryce Loski middle-schoolers and neighbors in a deceptively perfect 1963 suburbia. Juli a nonconformist with a weekend-painter dad (Aidan Quinn) has carried a torch for Bryce since second grade and all that time Bryce has been running from her cooties as fast as he can. But its eighth grade and perspectives are about to get turned on their heads sparked by Bryces discovery of Julis moral courage and his own teenage spinelessness. Could he -- horrors -- have feelings for her?Like its source Wendelin van Draanens popular 2001 young-adult novel ""Flipped alternates narrators showing us events from both Bryces and Julis points of view. Its a gimmick thats pithier and more insightful on the page but in Reiners hand its cute enough and it does allow him to access the storys darker aspects. Julis parents have money troubles since dads paying to keep his mentally challenged brother (Kevin Weisman unconvincingly going the full . . . oh never mind) in private care. Bryces dad (Anthony Edwards) is an embittered jerk whose sarcasm his son must learn to reject if hes to be his own person. There are lessons here that roll out well past childhood.So why does Reiner work so hard to keep the movie in a toothless period playground? The book was set in the present but putting the story in the Wayback Machine for 1963 allows the director to crank up the jukebox hits (""Teenager in Love obviously and a lot of Everly Brothers) and film everything with an over-honeyed glow. ""Stand By Me is a work of stark realism in comparison When Juli climbs a patently fake-looking tree and stares dreamily out at the sunset the vista looks like Norman Rockwells vision of Teletubbyland.At its worst this is theme-restaurant nostalgia rather than the real thing resting on shared affection for old pop songs and fins on cars without getting at the actual emotions beyond those memories. At its best -- which is often enough and more than plenty for some -- ""Flipped is a lumpy but interestingly tough tale of young love and growing up with a solid cast of veterans surrounding the leads. The mothers are played by Rebecca De Mornay and Penelope Ann Miller -- an 80s-movie siren and sweetie pie both gone domestic -- and Bryces wise old granddad is given flesh and substance by a frail-looking John Mahoney (""Frasier ""Moonstruck).For his part McAuliffe holds the screen well enough but Carroll has the assurance and down-to-earth grace to mark her as something special. A lot of parents grandparents and older kids will love this movie although you should probably leave the cynical teens and college crowd at home -- theres not a tattoo nor piercing in sight. (There is a little a bit of cussing though and one extremely weird close-up of a snake swallowing an egg.) ""Flipped has a warmly beating heart encased in plastic and if you can get past the packaging you may feel oddly if generically at home.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Rob Reiners Flipped contains a number of elements that would be problematically sentimental individually but prove disastrous when combined. Where most filmmakers would limit themselves to wall-to-wall narration by telegenic children or a quaint period setting or a kindly soft-spoken grandfather who speaks exclusively in hard-won life lessons or a subplot involving a mentally challenged uncle with a similar propensity for imparting life lessons or soft-focus perpetually glowing cinematography thats equally indebted to Thomas Kinkade and Norman Rockwell or adorable animals or elaborate metaphors about trees or a ubiquitous soundtrack of heart-tugging oldies Reiner unites all these maudlin elements into one hilariously overwrought romantic comedy. He then slathers on multiple coats of sentimentality just in case a solitary moment of restraint or understatement somehow slipped through. Set in Kennedy-era small-town America Flipped casts Madeline Carroll as an eccentric little girl so precocious she seems ready to skip high school entirely and run a co-op farm in Vermont the minute she hits her teens. For years Carroll has nursed a painfully unrequited crush on handsome neighbor Callan McAuliffe but he sees her only as the weird girl who raises chickens in her yard and stalks him adorably. Then one day everything changes and this boy with Troy Donahue-style good looks and no discernible personality suddenly falls for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl in training with altogether too much personality. Flipped boasts a structure thats novel and promising in theory but deadly in practice Its romantic leads take turns delivering narration that skews events distinctly in their individual favor. This results in a film that spells everything out visually then further elaborates through groaningly obvious dialogue then drives every point home for slow-witted audiences via shameless narration. Flipped offers an achingly familiar look at puppy love from two contrasting angles each of them insufferably saccharine. Reiner should just be grateful that a directors bad movies cant negate his good ones or the world would wake up tomorrow to discover that The Princess Bride and This Is Spinal Tap--the last film before Flipped to feature a Reiner writing credit--had mysteriously vanished along with the respect Reiner once commanded from critics and audiences alike.

Comments click to enlarge Flipped Video Rated PG  90 minutes  2010 Based on a popular young-adult novel and brimming with all the angst and schmaltz youd expect from such a source this awkward coming-of-age drama does nothing to gild the legacy of middlebrow maestro Rob Reiner (The Bucket List Stand By Me). The agreeable Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe star as kids growing up in the same Michigan neighborhood; over time they must come to terms with the spiritual rot beneath their 1960s suburban utopia. Everything that happens is presented first through his eyes and then through hers Rashomon-style and accompanied by heavy-handed voice-over. Eventually the kids figure out that parents and other authority figures (among them Rebecca De Mornay Anthony Edwards Penelope Miller and Aidan Quinn) dont always have it together.

"Flipped is lost in time - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 starsFlipped is lost in timeRob Reiner alters storys setting saps powerAugust 26 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie critic2 stars If teaching our children to treat their friends neighbors and fellow humans with some kindness were a snap we wouldnt devour books such as ""Flipped"" the 2001 young-adult favorite by Wendelin Van Draanen. Its about the complicated relationship between two kids Juli and Bryce and their intertwined lives between the second and eighth grade as they careen in and out of one-sided crushes jealousies affection dawning respect and something like love. Something like it. We dont know anything about anything at that age and yet we know everything. The story should have made for charming results on screen. Instead -- and I truly dont enjoy saying so -- co-adapter and director Rob Reiners picture lands somewhere between synthetic nostalgia and the texture of real life. The kids certainly are up to it; Madeline Carrolls Juli and Callan McAuliffes Bryce have all the right stuff the emotional directness to make us care. The adult cast includes the formidable John Mahoney as Bryces granddad who helps Bryce to see what hes been missing. So why does ""Flipped"" (which has its ardent fans) feel to me like a good try as opposed to a good film? Partly its the horsey mechanics of the thing. Taking Van Draanens he said/she said story out of its original modern-day setting and back into the late 1950s and early 60s Reiner lays on the honey-coated atmosphere and races around to establish Julis industrial-strength crush her loving bohemian family ( Aidan Quinn and Penelope Ann Miller play her folks) and the flip side of it all across the street. There Bryces seemingly picture-perfect parents (played by Rebecca De Mornay and overdoing the characters inner boorishness Anthony Edwards) stand in stark opposition to Julis world. As the kids enter junior high they have an increasingly tough time separating their former preteen selves from the people theyre becoming. Juli realizes Bryce isnt perfect. Bryce realizes Juli is more than an aggravator in pigtails. The script co-written by Andrew Scheinman relies on voice-over narration the way a fish relies on water. Perhaps there was no other way to adapt ""Flipped"" for the movies. Perhaps though it wouldve been worth looking for one. Were a long way tonally from the sinister backdrop of ""Stand by Me"" Reiners 1986 coming-of-age yarn based on Stephen Kings ""The Body"" but the comparisons are inevitable. Re-watching ""Stand by Me"" the other day I was struck at how straightforward yet pleasing Reiners pacing and camera placement are in that film whether you love the material or not. By contrast ""Flipped"" is all postcards and Lasse Hallstrom sunsets and it never calms down or settles into itself. Serious matters are addressed such as Julis institutionalized brother but the movie struggles to resolve its mood swings. If it clicks with audiences I suspect itll be because of Carroll who really is a fine young actress and doesnt push a single scene. Even when her cohorts do. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for language and some thematic material) Cast Madeline Carroll (Juli); Callan McAuliffe (Bryce); Rebecca De Mornay (Patsy); Anthony Edwards (Steven); John Mahoney (Chet); Penelope Ann Miller (Trina); Aidan Quinn (Richard) Credits Directed by Rob Reiner; written by Reiner and Andrew Scheinman based on the novel by Wendelin Van Draanen; produced by Reiner and Alan Greisman.

Thats not a complaint you understand. Id turn out for a movie that followed her around Milwaukee. And this movie eventually grows into something delicate and intriguing a midlife romance that may or may not be consummated. But Ms. Clarksons performance as Juliette the fashion-writer wife of a United Nations functionary is the films reason for being. She makes yearning palpable. She turns mysterious silences into a language of love. ENLARGE Alexander Siddig and Patricia Clarkson in Cairo Time. IFC Films Juliette states her purpose in coming to Cairo with her first words ""Im here to see my husband"" she tells an Egyptian customs officer. Then Ms. Naddas minimalist script announces its intentions with a plot device. Her husband Mark isnt there--hes stuck in Gaza dealing with an uprising. But Mark has sent his former security officer a tall dark and dangerously handsome melancholic named Tareq (Alexander Siddig) to meet Juliette at the airport and take her to her hotel. Thats the beginning of a leisurely traveloguey tease. The longer Mark stays in Gaza the more sights Juliette and Tareq get to see--the Pyramids despite her promise to save them for a visit with her husband plus belly dancing bad traffic the citys souks the eternal Nile and the surreal chalk formations of the White Desert. (Luc Montpellier did the handsome cinematography.) And the more sights they see the closer they come to noticing what weve seen all along that theyre a couple trying to behave like decorous acquaintances. ""Cairo Time""--the title evokes a languorous rhythm of life that Juliette resists and then accepts--demands patience even forbearance. Notwithstanding the expansive scenery its a small-scale production that takes several odd and tentative turns and often threatens to become a one-woman show even though the Sudan-born Mr. Siddig is a skillful actor and an appealing presence. (When Juliette says she has always wanted to go to Alexandria Tareq replies dryly ""You know the library burned down.) Still the Canadian filmmaker Ms. Nadda has an admirable fondness for ambiguity which complements her stars gift for subtle revelation. Ive been an unabashed fan of Ms. Clarkson ever since I saw her more than a decade ago in ""High Art"" playing Greta a German cokehead with Dietrichs voice and Fassbinders name on her lips. She was wonderful as the grief-stricken painter in ""The Station Agent""; as the droll world-weary mother in ""Pieces of April""; as the gravely tender physician in ""Lars and the Real Girl"" (which took place north of Milwaukee). Watching her in ""Cairo Time"" I thought back to ""Summertime"" the 1955 David Lean melodrama with Katharine Hepburn as another middle-age American tourist a lonely spinster hoping wistfully and fearfully to find romance in Venice. Faithful to the genre as well as the period Ms. Hepburn played her role with unconcealed and affecting passion. Ms. Clarkson takes a different approach. Instead of emphasizing Juliettes loneliness she conceals it as best she can. Instead of acknowledging her characters ardent desire for love and intimacy she withholds it like a top-secret eyes-only text. In a candidly retro romance hers is a quintessentially modern performance minimalist in style and maximalist in impact. See a clip from the new film ""The Other Guys"" starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Video courtesy of Columbia Pictures. The Other Guys Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg are hapless cops and mismatched buddies in ""The Other Guys"" a summer movie that honors summer-movie conventions with a vengeance. Its loud raunchy semicoherent and stuffed to the bursting point with heavy weaponry and car chases most of which involve a red cocaine-covered Prius thats been pressed into service as a police car. But Adam McKays comedy of chaos which he wrote with Chris Henchy can also be very funny albeit fitfully an extended riff on ""Law amp; Order"" that is blessed with inventive wordplay in the sacred tradition of ""Airplane"" (Youd have to see it which wouldnt be torture at all to understand why the standard Miranda phraseology has been modified to ""Anything you do or say can be used as a flotation device."") Mr. Ferrell is Allen Gamble an underachieving detective whos genuinely devoted to doing paperwork and unaccountably attractive to gorgeous women Eva Mendes is his physician wife. Mr. Wahlberg is Terry Hoitz a former NYPD hotshot--and amateur ballet dancer--whose career turned cold when he shot Derek Jeter by mistake The Yankees shortstop plays himself. In the logic of the title the departments true hotshots are played by Samuel L. Jackson and Dwayne Johnson while the other guys include losers like Allen and Terry. I cant reveal the nature of the sensational gag that features Messrs. Jackson and Johnson but I can tell you that it would make Alfred Hitchcock proud. ENLARGE Will Ferrell Steve Coogan and Mark Wahlberg in The Other Guys. Macall Polay In the past several years Mr. Ferrells feature career has careered like a Prius with unintended acceleration in reverse he starred in ""Land of the Lost"" which was execrable; in ""Step Brothers"" ditto; and in ""Blades of Glory"" which was better than bad but icicle-brittle and perilously thin. How nice then to see him back in form with a role that gives him a chance to display the gentleness--indeed the rueful gentleness--that distinguished his performance as the lovesick actor in Woody Allens ""Melinda and Melinda."" Mr. Ferrells Allen is a genuinely sweet guy as well as a crazed one As evidence his time-out for a surreal folk ballad along with his mad reminiscence about being a pimp in college. (Jon Brion did the music which includes the lullaby ""Pimps Dont Cry."") Mr. Wahlberg provides counterpoint to his co-stars nuances by declaiming his lines at the top of his voice here again the results can be hilarious when they arent silly. Michael Keaton is a police captain who moonlights at Bed Bath amp; Beyond. Steve Coogan a reliably funny actor isnt funny as a bad guy scheming to defraud the city. He seems to think hes in a drama. Watch a clip from the new film ""Flipped."" Video courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures. Flipped I cant say anything nice about ""Flipped"" a painfully clumsy adaptation of a tween novel by Wendelin Van Draanen. But I cant say nothing at all since the film was directed by Rob Reiner who has done enough good work in the past to make us care about what hes up to now. (In the increasingly distant past ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and ""Stand By Me"" came out a quarter-century ago.) The screenplay written by Mr. Reiner and Andrew Scheinman uses extensive voice-over passages to reproduce the structure of the book and presents parallel accounts of a love that grows however erratically between a boy named Bryce and a girl named Juli in a sanitized American suburb during the middle of the last century. That use and abuse of voice-over--relentlessly monotonous and pitilessly repetitive line readings monitored by a director with a tin ear--is the first disastrous choice but not the only one. Minutes seem like hours as the narratives dawdles and stalls how much can a moviegoer care about a science project or the dark side of a ""Leave It to Beaver"" family that doesnt have a bright side worth a second glance? For the record Juli calls her science project ""A Chicken Is Born."" The film could be called ""An Egg Is Laid.""

"Flipped and charmed - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Rob ReinerFlipped and charmedRob Reiner gives us yet another winning coming-of-age tale this time following the growing attraction between a girl and a boy in the 60s that audiences of any age can enjoy.August 06 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic As he proved so winningly in ""Stand by Me"" Rob Reiner is a filmmaker who has a way of telling stories about kids suffusing them with ambivalence and insecurity about their still-evolving selves that feels both heartfelt and authentic. So it is once again many years later with ""Flipped"" a tale of very young love and loss also set in the 60s. And though our two lovebirds Juli and Bryce live in white middle-class suburbia the experience feels universal and the oft-trod coming-of-age terrain feels newly turned. It begins in typical grade school fashion. Juli is all dreamy and swoony over the blue-eyed Bryce. He can barely talk because yuck shes a girl. She is undeterred. Hes convinced his life is over. Weve seen it before a what more can you expect? Thankfully a lot starting with the freshness of the fine blueprint from Wendelin Van Draanens popular contemporary young teen romance. Though Reiner opted to set it back in time by a few decades he and co-screenwriter Andrew Scheinman have remained true to the spirit style and a lot of the dialogue she created. But then from ""Stand by Me"" that 1986 classic ode to boyhood based on the Stephen King novel Reiner has become something of a savant when it comes to turning books into movies with ""The Princess Bride"" and ""Misery"" among his standouts and ""Flipped"" about to join them. When Juli and Bryce meet (played by Madeline Carroll and Callan McAuliffe for most of the film) its because his family has just moved to her tree-lined street a place where kids ride bikes play pickup football in the frontyard and go trick-or-treating without fear. Director of photography Thomas Del Ruth has given it all a Norman Rockwell glow that echoes his collaboration with the filmmaker on ""Stand by Me."" We are drawn into their world from two distinct points of view a his and hers. That ""he said she said"" push and pull is one of the cleverest conceits of the book and the film. We see a moment through Julis eyes then rewind and see it through Bryces with Reiner capturing all the fun irony and heartbreak possible out of those different points of view. With that as the starting point we follow the kids through the ups and downs of grade school family life and their growing (or not) attraction. Both young actors find that ideal balance of charm and intelligence without veering into too precocious and too pretty (which Ashley Taylor takes care of for everyone else but as Julis popular perky pony-tailed nemesis shes supposed to). A lot of the film is concerned with the idea of growing things other than Bryce and Juli. The fate of a giant sycamore becomes a crucial testing ground for not just their relationship but also for figuring out what is important in life. The school bus and the grade school cafeteria become microcosms of ever-shifting social divides. So many small details are perfectly wrought a the cruel way the kids in school call her name underscoring her bookish outsider unacceptable-ness. Back on the block there is the ""chicken and the egg"" controversy that grows out of Julis blue-ribbon science fair project on the evolution of chicks causing a rift between the kids and their families that they might not be able to overcome. In fact the way in which family frames a life becomes as essential to the film as it does to Bryce and Julis developing worldviews. Bryce is very much a product of an upwardly mobile environment with Anthony Edwards as Steven his tightly wound dad who is ever vigilant to ensure nothing tarnishes his hold on success including Julis working-class family. How does he know they arent up to snuff? They dont even take care of their frontyard a weed-filled blight on the neighborhood. It turns out Stevens conformity issues are not so different from his sons. Fortunately for the film he and the rest of the adults a a winning ensemble that includes Rebecca De Mornay Penelope Ann Miller Aidan Quinn and John Mahoney a arent through growing up either. Mahoney a little less irascible than he was in ""Frasier"" but just as insightful is Bryces grandfather and the stick that will prod Bryce into thinking for himself and Steven into rethinking things whether he wants to or not. Meanwhile Julis family is headed by Aidan Quinns Richard a guy whos got his priorities straight even though it means his bank account is slight. But then as he tries to teach Juli doing the right thing isnt ever easy never more poignantly than when it comes to his mentally disabled brother. In lesser hands this could all become overly sentimental and sugary sweet but instead we are treated to the artful nuance that comes from Reiners light touch. Helping to set the tone for the hard lessons here is the kind of great classic rock that a 60s era film makes possible. In this the filmmakers have sampled widely a including Carole King and Smokey Robinson a creating a soundtrack so rich youll be tempted to close your eyes and just listen. But dont. Because ""Flipped"" is the kind of small special movie that wraps you up in so much warmth humor and humanity that it will leave you wishing that stories like this werent so rare. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Spectacular Now and other films coming of (a new) ageJuly 20 2013Rob Reiners Flipped is getting careful handling from...August 5 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTRob ReinerGrade SchoolCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-flipped-20100806,0,1403934.story",200,flipped15,flipped,latimes

Andrei Filipov (Aleksei Guskov) pushes a broom at the Bolshoi where he lost his status as star conductor 30 years ago under Brezhnev for refusing to fire his Jewish musicians. Intercepting a fax from the Theatre du Chatelet inviting the legendary orchestra to perform in Paris Andrei rounds up his former colleagues in a scheme to pass themselves off as the real Bolshoi. To right an injustice from three decades ago -- and to occasion more interminable flashbacks -- the fallen maestro insists that violinist Anne-Marie Jacquet (Laurent) be the soloist during the performance of Tchaikovskys Violin Concerto. The emotional climax Smeary mascara runs down the cheeks of Miou-Miou playing Anne-Maries manager and a Link to Her Past. Witless director Radu Mihaileanu continuing the theme of false identity from his previous Live and Become (2005) holds the following truths to be self-evident Nothing is funnier than a Russian speaking syntactically absurd French (except maybe a half-empty Communist meeting hall). And nothing salves historical and ego wounds quite like 12 minutes of bombastic strings. (Melissa Anderson) (Monica Playhouse Sunset 5) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ALICE CREED In suspense films about confinement characters may be kidnapped or tortured but the real captive is the viewer. Were stuck in our seats powerless against manipulated time and repeated turnabouts eager or at least morbidly curious participants. For all of its stylistic ambitions and cool triangulations J Blakesons debut does little to modify or interrogate the genre eagerly trading on the spectacle of a young pretty girl tied up. Rhythmically and visually Blakeson takes an economical methodical approach documenting the grim preparations of two kidnappers Vic and Danny (Eddie Marsan and Martin Compston) from a place of chilly reserve. Their plan and process which gradually inevitably come asunder is the engine of suspense recalling Hitchcocks Rope -- until a second-act reveal outdoes even the masters own psychosexual hysteria. Marsan scowls and spittles Compston bares gleaming teeth for all occasions and Gemma Arterton completes the trio by getting stripped splayed and degraded early and often. Blakesons feature-length calling card has storyboarded austerity and sadomasochistic promise but in the end lets the game play out in a familiar flurry of double-crossings two-timings and false deaths content to only fetishize itself. (Eric Hynes) (Monica Playhouse Sunset 5)GO  ENEMIES OF THE PEOPLE Taking in Enemies of the People is a little like watching a Cambodian Shoah but as if we had access to the directors methods and motivations instead of just the astonishing results. Chronicling his ongoing project to track down and document those responsible for the Khmer Rouges late-70s reign of terror co-director Thet Sambath whose father (directly) and mother (indirectly) were murdered by the regime draws on decade-long relationships he forged with both Cambodias former second-in-command Nuon Chea and average peasants who were enlisted in the killing fields (often like Claude Lanzmann he wins their confidence under questionable pretenses). He has crafted an extraordinary historical testimonial While he and co-director Rob Lemkin dont operate with the cool ruthlessness of the Shoah director -- and occasionally draw on the archival footage verboten to the earlier project -- the results are often as violently direct. They may black out one subjects face at her request -- a retreat from the cruelty of Lanzmanns hidden cameras -- but when theyre framing a tight close-up of an otherwise sympathetic farmer talking about how he killed in cold blood or taking in the pained expression on Cheas face when Sambath at last reveals his own family history the pairs probing filmmaking feels like anything but a compromise. (Andrew Schenker) (Music Hall)FLIPPED Youll be forgiven for groaning through the first 20 minutes of Rob Reiners Flipped which kicks off in a key of aggressively picturesque whiteness -- I mean wholesomeness. Adapted by Reiner and Andrew Scheinman from Wendelin Van Draanens novel and set in a late-50s America rooted more in that eras sitcoms than reality the films coming-of-age love story follows its hero and heroine from second grade to junior high. Juli (Madeline Caroll excellent) loves Bryce (Callan McAuliffe also excellent) from the moment his family moves in across the street. Bryce terrified of Julis forthrightness masks his terror behind asshole behavior that worsens with puberty -- until those pangs of true love hit him. Narrated by both young characters Flipped alternates p.o.v. to show how each interprets the same situations. The film settles into its hard-sell charm when it and Bryce segue from being dishearteningly dismissive of Juli as a stalker-turned-crazed-eco-activist (foreshadowing 60s political upheaval) to celebrating her intrinsically principled decency. Bryce meanwhile struggles to shed an ideal of middle-class macho defined by his jerk father and reinforced by his best friend. Reiner in very broad strokes works in issues of poverty thwarted dreams and family obligation and almost pulls it off thanks to Anthony Edwards Aidan Quinn Rebecca De Mornay Penelope Ann Miller and John Mahoney who impart humor and humanity to thinly sketched characters.

Bromberg persuaded her to give him access to a particular holy grail the surviving 15 hours of rushes and test footage from French director Clouzots abandoned would-be masterpiece Inferno. Starring Serge Reggiani and Romy Schneider Inferno was meant to portray jealousy as a form of mental illness but the real head case was its director. Clouzot was unable to finish the movie; as both the survivors interviewed and the surviving footage makes clear the attempt drove him half-mad. Inferno was an ambitious production. Clouzot prepared elaborately color-coded charts tracking his heros paranoid state. There were three separate camera crews. Columbia Pictures provided an ""unlimited budget"" much of which was spent on visual experiments involving superimpositions dappled light patterns fun-house mirror distortions and color inversion meant to convey a deranged consciousness. But rather than communicating his protagonists madness Clouzot appears to be documenting his own. Who knows how these fantastic shots of Schneider lying naked in the path of an onrushing locomotive or covered with glitter and smoking a cigarette in reverse would have played in the finished film? Who cares? For all the irrationality that fueled Clouzots project its reasonable to assume that the finished Inferno would never have been any better than this arrangement of its shards. (J. Hoberman) (Sunset 5)THE OTHER GUYS After obligatory helicopter views of New Yorks skyline open Adam McKays The Other Guys were introduced to Danson and Highsmith (Dwayne Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson) a duo of unflappable supercops who keep the city exciting if not safe with law enforcement by the Michael Bay book. The Other Guys arent them. This is the fourth feature collaboration between McKay and Will Ferrell who make baggy improvisational comedies about utter boobs (Anchormans Ron Burgundy Talladega Nights Ricky Bobby) like detectives Allen Gamble (Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg). Gamble is an emasculated Prius owner transferred from forensic accounting. Loose cannon Hoitz seems to have been partnered with Gamble as punishment -- hes been the departmental black sheep since a humiliating incident that earned him the nickname ""Yankee Clipper."" Laying out its premise The Other Guys is loose and funny. But as it progresses the leads are given little to do but trade off one-liners while treading the waters of an increasingly choppy plot. Gamble and Hoitz catch the scent of something big during a routine pickup of a Wall Street hustler (Steve Coogan) and following the clues The Other Guys turns more hectic than antic. Somebody didnt pack enough comedy for this long trip and if there were a computer program that automatically generated generic action scenes after you punch in participating actors names -- and there may well be -- the product would look like The Other Guys shoot-em-ups. (Nick Pinkerton) (Citywide)PATRIK AGE 1.5 Their new suburban house is lovely the neighbors friendly the nursery ready -- and now all that Goran (Gustaf Skarsgard) and his husband Sven (Torkel Petersson) need to make their familial dreams come true is an actual child. A letter from Swedish Social Services promises that a baby is on the way but what arrives at the door instead is Patrik (Thomas Ljungman) a 15-year-old orphan with a criminal record and little tolerance for ""homos."" The couple doesnt handle the surprise very well particularly Sven who gets more loutish by the hour. Writer-director Ella Lemhagens adaptation of Michael Drukers play begins rather self-consciously as a broad comedy but the tone darkens quickly as Goran and Svens relationship unravels under the pressure leaving Goran to handle the boy who turns out not to be such a holy terror after all. There arent many surprises to what follows but one is never bored thanks to the innate charms of Skarsgard and young Ljungman both of whom have such sweetly hopeful smiles that its hard not to wish them eternal happiness even as we wait in vain for Lemhagen to throw their characters a few real-world challenges -- they do an awful lot of gardening. (Chuck Wilson) (Nuart)STEP-UP 3D The dance battles that structure the Step Up films are all about the Move -- the one unexpected mind-blowing totally impossible move that ends a competition and raises the game. The franchise itself has attempted such a maneuver with its third installment Step Up 3D which you might have guessed was filmed in 3-D. Meant to take the scrappy and often ingeniously choreographed dance sequences to the next level the result is stalled between floors Some sick moves get even sicker; some become distorted and freakishly distracting. Those who watch these films for the dancing (i.e. everyone not trying to learn English) will find themselves in a purist bind Arent these dancers their own special effects? Some previous cast members return including Moose (Adam Sevani) and Camille (Alyson Stoner) NYU freshmen whose friendship is tested when Moose is recruited to help a local dance crew win a really important thingy. Also recruited is Natalie (Sharni Vinson) the mysterious designated hottie who is not all that she seems Director Jon Chu (Step Up 2 The Streets) lets his dancers define the space. For all of the technical dazzle his actual technique -- full-body shots and essential cutting showcased in a spectacular single-take duet through New Yorks streets -- is blissfully old-school. (Michelle Orange) (Citywide) TWELVE ""Maybe you know how it is. Maybe you dont"" gravely intones Kiefer Sutherland the narrator of Joel Schumachers silly tone-deaf adaptation of Nick McDonells 2002 book about entitled Upper East Side teenage twerps. Famously published when its author was only 18 Twelve the book briskly moves along with the Didionesque disdain of an insider -- material that first-time screenwriter Jordan Melamed transforms into a hand-wringing cautionary tale with a tacked-on moral lesson and visions of a dead beatific mother. Gossip Girls Chace Crawford stars as White Mike a Camus-quoting prep-school dropout who refrains from using any of the substances he sells to his former classmates narcissists who are hurting deeply because their parents go on vacation without them reachable only by satellite phone. Though Crawfords bangs and facial hair are the most art-directed aspect of the movie hes costumed to look like a member of the Trenchcoat Mafia (Madison Avenue branch). But White Mike is not the psychopath of the story -- that would be Claude (Billy Magnussen) who has left rehab and does something very bad at a party after Mom prefers talking with his younger brother Chris (Rory Culkin). Filthy-rich parents remember Your adolescent children really want to Skype with you when youre in St. Barts. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide)THE WILDEST DREAM CONQUEST OF EVEREST Everest looks suitably majestic in this IMAX documentary though five different expeditions on the peak are awkwardly cobbled into one dubious narrative. At issue is whether in 1924 George Mallory and his rope mate reached the summit 50 years before credited first-timer Edmund Hillary. Mallorys body was discovered in 1999 by American climber Conrad Anker which prompted much media speculation and several new books on the subject. In 2007 Anker went back to test the hypothesis -- i.e. sell more books and make this movie with director Anthony Geffen -- that Mallory mightve been able to free-climb the ""Second Step"" on Everests north side (a section today scaled using an aluminum ladder). In addition to the many stills old newsreels and passages read from Mallorys loving correspondence with his wife Anker and his English rope-mate briefly don (re-created) 20s climbing attire to ponder if Mallory couldve survived in the Death Zone without plastic boots and down parkas. But this becomes a somewhat ridiculous costume show with two trudging figures in tweed filmed in sepia tones set to the epistolary drama. ""Theres no dream that mustnt be dared"" says Mallory through the voice of Ralph Fiennes. Liam Neeson narrates and in an unintentionally morbid mournful touch Neesons late wife Natasha Richardson reads the letters from Ruth Mallory. The photography is stunning of course but the historical conjecture and CSI Everest vibe are less impressive.

Nostalgia ultimately gets the best of director Rob Reiner in ""Flipped"" a well-intentioned family pic about first love thats overly concerned with period details and life lessons rather than the genuinely sweet characters at its center. Though thankfully skirting the more saccharine manipulations of Reiners ""The Bucket List"" ""Flipped"" is nonetheless a somewhat leaden piece of work its considerable charms nearly smothered by strange pacing and awkward staging. Opening in limited release before spreading wide this looks to be a profitably modest theatrical draw followed by more generous homevid activity. Adapted from Wendelin Van Draanens well-loved 2001 young-adult novel ""Flipped"" delves into the intricacies of a slowly budding junior-high romance ""Rashomon""-style with key incidents told and retold by each side of the gender divide. Representing that divide are across-the-street neighbors Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll) an idealistic oddball with a knack for climbing trees and raising chickens and Bryce Loski (Callan McAuliffe) an oft-confused all-American type. As Juli has harbored a crush on him since second-grade Bryce has mastered ducking her attentions through ""a half-decade of strategic avoidance"" he tells us in voiceover. As they enter middle school Bryce begins to feel guilty for so frequently joining the crowd as they mock her idiosyncrasies which ever-so-incrementally leads him toward more serious feelings for her while Juli starts to wonder what she ever saw in this rather unimaginative pretty-boy. Set in rural Michigan in the early 1960s (the novel took place in the present day) the film charts the relationships episodic progress while also limning the class divide between the two families contrasting Julis loving blue-collar clan with Bryces judgmental upper-middle-class one. The film never tries to clutter its suburban milieu with excessive drama yet so many scenes are played twice to accommodate the opposing perspectives that things start to drag. Pic also gains little from being transposed to the postwar era of Reiners childhood (and of his far superior ""Stand by Me""). In fact the vintage details ultimately become a distraction; the period seems to encourage an almost Thomas Kinkade-worthy idealization in the director -- every scene appears to take place during the magic hour when even McAuliffes peach fuzz glows in the warm amber light -- with all of the most obvious cultural signifiers and music popping up at every turn. (There will be Everly Brothers.) Reiner maintains an even tone through most of the film though he notably loses control whenever the focus leaves the two protagonists. Anthony Edwards (as Bryces choleric father) never seems to know whether hes supposed to provide outright villainy or goofy comic relief and a late scene in which he gets drunk and slaps Bryces older sister comes from out of nowhere. Likewise Julis visit to her institutionalized uncle (Kevin Weisman) comes across as uncomfortably manipulative. The two young leads do an admirable job carrying the film however and one wishes they were granted more time to simply be their characters rather than running the kiddie romantic-comedy gantlet. Carroll is both adorable and believably self-possessed; unlike so many actors tasked with playing precocious children shes still recognizably a kid despite her maturity. Aussie first-timer McAuliffe is a bit more stilted in his line readings though hes still a game performer and gets his American accent just about right. Adult supporting players are largely competent with Aidan Quinn particularly likable as Julis father and John Mahoney making the best of his ""teller of homespun truths"" part as Bryces grandfather. Technical contributions are pro although the tendency toward high-gloss seemingly CG-sweetened sunsets gets a bit cloying.

Daily Edition Login to download Flipped -- Film Review 958 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Empty TWITTER Empty With only one hit film since the mid-90s -- and that one being a cloying and artificial cancer comedy ""The Bucket List"" -- Rob Reiner looks to get his mojo back with ""Flipped"" a return to the sometimes painful and sometimes poignant coming-of-age film he pulled off so splendidly in his 1986 film ""Stand By Me."" But what seemingly came easily more than two decades ago is now a struggle. Reiner again demonstrates compassion and insight into young peoples battles to acquire self-knowledge but in his new film too many clearly fictional characters and contrived situations bog down his story.The period film also feels out of sorts with the kind of tweener film that succeeds at todays boxoffice. Indeed ""Flipped"" so wallows in nostalgia with a soft-rock soundtrack from the late 50s/early 60s and a "" Mad Men Goes to Main Street"" look to cars clothes and decor that the films main appeal probably will be to Baby Boomers -- not the kind of demographic Warner Bros. normally caters to. This probably explains the early August release date for the Castle Rock production.There even is a hint of Reiners 1989 comedy hit ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" in the six-year journey of a ""relationship"" between two neighborhood youngsters. Those quote marks indicate the one-way nature of this troubled friendship. On the day Bryce (Australias Callan McAuliffe) moves into a vaguely rural suburb of an unnamed town Juli (Madeline Carroll) flips over him. However the second-grade boy wants nothing to do with her.So Juli who lives across the street stalks Bryce for six years until junior high. This amounts to as Bryces voice-over narration puts it ""half a decade of strategic avoidance and social discomfort.""Juli also gets her own voice-over narration as well as events seen from her vantage point. But this film written by Reiner and longtime collaborator Andrew Scheinman from a novel by Wendelin Van Draanen is very much told from the boys point of view. Unfortunately Juli is the more interesting character.Juli is tenacious and a fighter. When workers show up to cut down an ancient sycamore tree she loves she climbs the tree and refuses to leave until fire and police arrive. When made aware of the forlorn state of her familys unkempt rental property because of a snide remark by Bryce she spends weeks transforming the front yard into a thing worthy of House Beautiful.Bryce? Well beside snide remarks and strategic avoidance he shirks responsibility plays a little basketball and is generally dull and uncool. Admittedly the script does him no favors. If he does say something hell later regret you can bet Juli will overhear him.The youngsters parents are designed to be even more schematic. Bryces mom and dad (Rebecca De Mornay and Anthony Edwards) stand for superficial values and misleading appearances. His dad is bitter and snide -- runs in the family apparently -- having traded his one-time artistic bent for bread-winner duties and middle-class social virtues. All that redeems Bryces family is his grandfather (John Mahoney) who helps Juli tame her front yard and ill disguises his disdain for his son-in-laws pretensions.Julis family is artistic and goodhearted. Dad (Aidan Quinn) paints landscapes and Mom (Penelope Ann Miller) works part-time jobs so the family can funnel much of their money into maintaining Dads mentally disabled brother (Kevin Weisman) in a private-care facility.The films few boy-girl scenes -- surprisingly few given that this is the core of the story -- work reasonably well. Unlike their mostly fictional elders the young people talk and behave realistically. Perhaps not as much so as the boys in ""Stand By Me"" but youd still like to know more about them and less about their families. Mostly you would like to know what Juli sees in Bryce other than those ""dazzling eyes."" Theres a hint of a more dangerous kind of romantic movie here where a girl slowly realizes her dreamboat is a dry-docked dinghy. But no Reiner isnt going deviate from his ""When Harry Met Sally ..."" formula. All those mixed messages eventually will get through and all should be well at least until the next thoughtless remark by Bryce.Reiners young actors acquit themselves well with honest and unabashed performances. The adults do as best as they can in thinly written roles. All goes smoothly behind the scenes though you do wish every sequence wasnt determined to hit you over the head with period details.Opens Friday Aug. 6 (Warner Bros.)Production Castle Rock Entertainment presents a Rob Reiner/Alan Greisman productionCast Madeline Carroll Callan McAuliffe Rebecca De Mornay Anthony Edwards John Mahoney Penelope Ann Miller Aidan Quinn Kevin WeismanDirector Rob ReinerScreenwriters-producers Rob Reiner Andrew ScheinmanBased on the novel by Wendelin Van DraanenExecutive producers Martin Shafer Liz Glotzer David SiegelDirector of photography Thomas Del Ruth Production designer Bill BrzeskiMusic Marc ShaimanCostume designer Durinda WoodEditor Robert LeightonRated PG 89 minutes FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Kirk Honeycutt THRnewsthr.com thr AP THRnewsthr.com thr Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter (c) 2016 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.
