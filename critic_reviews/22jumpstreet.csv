The joke which stretches from the first scene to the last is that both the filmmakers and the characters onscreen acknowledge the conceit. This smug self-awareness is funny for a while but eventually wears thin--at least it did for me (if not for the audience at the screening I attended).  When a film is long and only intermittently funny I lose patience with self-referential material. Instead of infiltrating a high school Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go to college this time but on an identical mission to find the source of a powerful new drug being passed around campus. As in the first picture these misfits get more engaged in being accepted by their classmates than in following the case. Hill is attracted to beautiful student Amber Stevens while Tatum has a bromance with football star Wyatt Russell (Kurts and Goldie Hawns son). The stars are likable doing what weve seen them do before; for most summer audiences that may be good enough. I was more enthusiastic about the supporting cast especially fast-talking twins Keith and Kenny Lucas and deadpan Jillian Bell as Stevens hostile roommate. They steal every scene theyre in--though in a film this haphazard that may be a minor compliment. A hip attitude seems to carry some comedies a long way and if this is a hit then the three writers who fashioned this screenplay (Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman) from Bacall and Jonah Hills story may have the right idea after all. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller bring the right energy to the proceedings. But in a world where sequels mean big business I dread the thought of more slipshod copycat-style movies winking at us while laughing all the way to the bank.

Theres enough flat jokes coupled with dropping the F bomb puts it the gutter. Despite the popularity of its starsif you like the ""back to school"" issue Rodney delivers better laugha. Also having Hill with the beauty is beyond belief. The Bond type ending was well done but again that was the end. Reply Bobby May 14 2016 116 am The movie sets out to please its fans and brings the laughs at a non-stop pace. The jokes are delivered perfectly. Sure its not the most original movie of the year but with that said is succeeds at pleasing the fans. Our packed theater laughed non-stop. If you are going to stick to a formula it should be done the way these writers did it as opposed to how the sequels to The Hangover were written.

Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller make good on their background in animation (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs The Lego Movie); the action sequences unlike those of the first movie have a sustained kinetic energy and the throwaway gags are delivered at such breakneck speed that this occasionally evokes old Looney Tunes cartoons. Too often though the satire of action-movie bombast is indistinguishable from the bombast itself (large-scale destruction over-loud sound effects actors yelling all their dialogue). With Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Ice Cube and lots of stand-up comedians in supporting roles. By Ben Sachs Official Site jumpstmovies.tumblr.comDirector Phil Lord and Christopher MillerProducer Neal H.

By David Denby Liam Neeson heads an ensemble cast in Paul Haggiss film.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios In Paul Haggiss new movie ""Third Person"" Anna (Olivia Wilde) a go-getting New York journalist is having an affair with Michael (Liam Neeson) a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist in a funk. In a darkened room in a posh Paris hotel he tries with diminishing confidence to finish writing a book. He flies Anna over and they taunt each other make love play complicated erotic games. Theyve been carrying on this way for two years--fighting keeps the affair alive. Neeson now sixty-two is recognizably stalwart--tough-tender and imposing--and its a pleasure to see him acting with a woman after so many fantasy characters and man-alone genre movies. The revelation is Wilde. A slender beauty with high cheekbones she makes Anna a full-fledged neurotic candid and demanding and changeable shifting abruptly from snuggling happiness to angry defiance. At one point after Michael locks a naked Anna out of his hotel room she races down the hallway to her own room and falls into bed laughing. Wildes Anna seems to have no center but thats the point. Shes harboring guilty secrets as is Michael and Haggiss insight in this movie is that guilt doesnt make people sodden or reclusive. On the contrary it makes them frantically alive seeking to grab something theyve missed. There are six main characters in ""Third Person"" all of whom are just as surprising as Anna and just as messed up. Haggis tells three stories set in Paris Rome and New York about different kinds of love and his unifying theme is that a ""third person""--a child an old lover--lingers in the background of every serious relationship. He intercuts the stories as he did in ""Crash"" (2004) but this time the characters dont impinge on one another--at least not until the end when he changes our relation to everything weve seen. As we discover four of the six have failed as parents sometimes with disastrous results but ""Third Person"" is hardly an accusation. Haggis shapes the stories as complicated adventures undertaken by damaged people whose unhappiness compels them to take risks. Much of the dialogue is prickly and intimate--so intimate that at times one has the impression that Haggis is unloading personal obsessions into his narratives as Bergman and Fellini did. Adrien Brody whom I have found languid and uninteresting in the past provides a second revelation. He uses his hollow bemusement and hangdog recessiveness to create an effective portrait of a man in a rut Scott a self-disgusted businessman who steals designs from Italian fashion houses in order to make cheap knockoffs in sweatshops. Scott wanders into an American bar in Rome and in a lengthy scene which Haggis builds slowly becomes enthralled by a beautiful and comically hot-tempered woman from Romania Monika (Moran Atias) who seems to have escaped from a Rome Opera production of ""Carmen."" She is carrying five thousand euros in cash to redeem her daughter from smugglers who are holding the girl in a boat. The story doesnt quite make sense especially as Monika rushes out of the bar leaving the money behind. But Scott is roused from his self-absorption by the womans crazy vivacity and he tries to help her out. Is he being conned? He doesnt much care Monika is funny and street-smart in ways that he could never be. Brody energized now enters into Scotts passion with the mixed fascination and fear of a man who may be throwing his life away but is happy to be doing something decisive at last. The tale dominated by Mila Kunis as Julia a rattled New Yorker lacks the exuberant spirit of the other two. Julia is one of those infuriating people who cant pull themselves together no matter how high the stakes. Broke disorganized always late she has lost custody of her little boy whom she longs for; a year earlier she may have hurt the child. Her ex-husband a famous artist (James Franco uncharacteristically fierce) has had her cut off financially and her visitation rights blocked. Kunis scrambling through the city gives the ultimate in desperate bottom-dog performances--those saucer eyes never stop pleading. Haggis treats this screwup with great sympathy recounting her cascading dilemmas in sorrowful detail. Life in the world Haggis creates is marked by bizarre coincidences missed opportunities and terrible luck. Living it isnt easy for anyone. All three tales are terse and volatile; as Haggis pushes toward the climax he makes the sequences shorter and more urgent with overlapping thematic and visual motifs until commonplace reality gives way altogether and the stories melt into one another. Haggis may be playing games but the director of ""Crash"" and ""In the Valley of Elah"" doesnt have it in him to be facetious. ""Third Person"" is serious or it is nothing. Literal-minded critics angered by a few improbable plot turns and a metafictional twist at the end will no doubt choose the latter. But ""Third Person"" is the kind of eccentric and emotionally exhausting movie whose ardent sincerity remains in memory after smoother more conventional works have passed into oblivion. Channing Tatum as Jenko the lunkhead cop in the buddy movie ""22 Jump Street""--the inevitable sequel to ""21 Jump Street""--has a guileless open face innocent of thought. As an actor Tatum seems without vanity. A former college athlete he has the physical prowess to settle into tough-guy roles or to play devastating Lotharios easing women into bed with his green eyes and his sweet smile. He appears to have decided however that playing ""the Sexiest Man Alive"" (People 2012) is not the best way to build a career. In the ""Jump Street"" movies he has developed his own comic style. Shy a little tentative his Jenko is an amiable dope who confuses ""Cate Blanchett"" with ""carte blanche"" and struggles to say a few words in Spanish. Hes so friendly that he makes stupidity attractive. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) his partner in dubious police work is his opposite. With his narrow-set eyes and small suspicious mouth Hill plays a man who is intelligent but self-conscious and easily frazzled. Schmidt gets into grotesque verbal tangles and has to take back half of what he says; every social encounter teeters on the edge of humiliation. Hills gift is for miffed feelings solemn dismay and huffy outrage but in ""22 Jump Street"" he uses his short rubbery body with greater abandon than he has in the past. The odd-couple formula--beauty and brains each man desperately needing the other--works as well as it does because Tatum and Hill arent forced to do everything in tandem. The bromance genre requires stand-alone skills if its not to collapse into bathos. In ""21"" the directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller seized every opportunity to remind us that they were creating a silly comedy based on an old TV show. (Johnny Depp the star of that show made a growling appearance.) In the same spirit of mocking self-acknowledgment they lose no opportunity in ""22"" to remind us that this is a sequel. At the beginning theres a quick flashback summary of ""21"" which is unnecessary since the plot is virtually identical again Jenko and Schmidt are told by the sulfurous Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) that they have to infiltrate a school to stop the spread of a new synthetic drug this one called WHYPHY. ""Seems you bitches are going to college"" Dickson says. On campus Jenko hangs out with the frat-boy-football-player crowd takes beer-bottle tops off with his eye socket at a party and is perfectly happy. ""Im the first person in my family to pretend to go to college"" Tatum says with a dreamy glow. Schmidt falling into sophomore-seducer mode struggles to impress a girl (Amber Stevens) with his savoir-faire and is so pleased when he scores that he wants a medal for it. But he resents Jenkos campus popularity and retreats into a world of hurt. The male bond is broken at least for a while. For long stretches Lord and Miller shove the drug-detection plot aside in favor of knockabout physical comedy some of it funny all of it obvious. (Tatum gracefully climbs and vaults; Hill barrels and flops.) Working with the screenwriter Michael Bacall they do the usual college satire a creepy too amorous professor; a pretentious poetry slam at ""Kaffe Haus"" with students nodding sagely at gibberish. In the best bit Jillian Bell from ""Workaholic"" and other comedy series plays a basilisk-eyed student who spots Schmidt as a ringer and burns his shaky self-esteem. ""22 Jump Street"" is hardly fresh but the picture has enough energy to get by. At the end positively bursting with glee over the newly created franchise Lord and Miller plaster the screen with posters for potential sequels Jenko and Schmidt in medical school in the space program at a dance academy. Id like to think theyre just kidding.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

"22 Jump Street - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire 22 Jump Street Posted by Christy Lemire on June 14 2014 6 Comments Columbia Pictures Rated R for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some language. Running time 112 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four. ""22 Jump Street"" is pretty much the exact same movie as ""21 Jump Street."" It knows it you know it and it knows that you know it. And that is why its brilliant. Youve got to hand it to directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller. ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" notwithstanding theyve made a career out of directing movies that are wholly aware of the conventions of their genres -- aware of the cliches and formulas and the laziness that results from playing it safe -- and they embrace them in a way that makes them seem not only strangely new but exhilarating. Their surprise 2012 hit ""21 Jump Street"" made fun of the trend of taking decades-old television programs and turning them into movies that nobody ever really needed to see anyway. Starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as mismatched buddy cops who go undercover at a high school ""21 Jump Street"" parodied the nostalgic tug these movies are supposed to provide only to slowly but surely morph into a legitimate action picture with genuine thrills. Lord and Miller get to laugh at their cake and eat it too. Earlier this year the hilarious and high-energy ""The Lego Movie"" very knowingly toyed with the way we regard toys and the way toys regard each other in movies only to wrap up with a massive twist that made all that playtime seem so much more poignant. The perky anthem ""Everything Is Awesome"" is indeed awesome but its also a pointed statement on the oppressive blandness that permeates pop culture. Again Lord and Miller always find a way to have it both ways. All we can do is watch in awe as their films function on multiple levels simultaneously. Now we have ""22 Jump Street"" which -- like ""The Lego Movie"" -- will require a second viewing to catch all the clever rapid-fire lines details and bits you missed while you were busy laughing your ass off. It is a sequel that tools on how unoriginal sequels tend to be. The script from Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman takes absolutely no chances but still ends up feeling daring -- or at least entertaining as hell. This time Tatum and Hill reteam as Metro City cops Jenko and Schmidt. Their office is now in the Vietnamese church across the street from where they used to work where the address is -- you guessed it -- 22 Jump Street. Their boss Capt. Dickson (a perpetually pissed and profane Ice Cube) sends them to college on what is essentially the same assignment they had when he sent them to high school uncover a drug ring. Dickson knows its the same assignment Jenko and Schmidt know it and we know it. He even goes so far as to tell them to do the exact same thing they did last time. Some variation on that phrasing crops up repeatedly in ""22 Jump Street"" but even the repetition ends up being absurdly funny. There are also several references to ""the budget"" in a sly wink at the production process itself. Whereas high school was the nerdy Schmidts place to shine college is tailor-made for the beefy Jenko. In no time hes become the football teams star receiver and gotten in tight with the jock frat on campus. Ostensibly all this socializing is for the sake of the investigation but it takes him away from his partner and pal Schmidt who never quite fits in when it comes time to do traditional manly-man things like open beer bottles with your eyelids. The way ""22 Jump Street"" explores the rift that develops between them -- as well as the blossoming friendship Jenko enjoys with quarterback and fraternity president Zook (Wyatt Russell) -- isnt just astute its surprisingly touching. For several sequences these characters play it totally straight for lack of a better word while in the extremes of heterosexual male friendship. Jenko is torn between two lovers if you will even going so far as to attend couples therapy with Schmidt to allow the two to work through their resentments and jealousies. But ""22 Jump Street"" remains kind to its characters throughout and to the emotions that emerge from these bromances which are real and complex. Still Jenko and Schmidt have a job to do seek out the dealer whose popular synthetic drug known as Why-Phy (say it out loud) resulted in the death of a promising female student. As is always the case in mismatched buddy-cop movies they approach this task in very different ways. Schmidt is the brain Jenko is the brawn but invariably they stumble toward their discoveries together. Sometimes that means literal stumbling as ""22 Jump Street"" features chases that rival Looney Tunes in their cartoonishness. Through it all Hill and Tatum retain a loose comfortable chemistry and an energy as they bounce off each other thats infectious. Hill is the master of the deadpan self-deprecating one-liner while Tatum goes big in his buffoonery. Theyre both so completely endearing that you long to see them in other kinds of movies. (Along those lines PLEASE stay for the closing credits which might be the best part of the entire film.) Hill also has some lovely moments with Amber Stevens as the art major who provides both intel and romance. Meanwhile Russell as Jenkos new BFF is afforded more decency than you usually see from such a BMOC type. Among the packed supporting cast -- which includes Nick Offerman Dave Franco Rob Riggle and Peter Stormare -- Jillian Bell is a standout as Stevens snarky roommate whos onto the fact that hes a narc from day one. She knows it he knows it we all know it. Whoever said ""Change is good"" should stop thinking so hard.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jun 13 2014 Culture Viewers who caught the unexpectedly clever 21 Jump Street adaptation two years ago will recall the impressive devotion (and still more impressive degree of irony) with which the movie clung to formula the undercover cops in high school the scourge of a new drug on campus the headquarters in a deconsecrated chapel. By contrast the movies sequel 22 Jump Street opens with something new partners Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) as adults staging--or rather trying to stage--a relatively conventional drug bust. The sequence I think its fair to say is at best a moderate disappointment culminating in a Hill-entangled-with-an-octopus gag that is a pale shadow of his trials with a telephone cord in last years The Wolf of Wall Street.Related Story So It Turns Out That Channing Tatum Is a Pretty Good Actor But just when we fear that this may be shaping up to be one of many many ill-conceived comedy sequels 22 Jump Street shows that the joke is on us. That initial mission having proven a flop (by law-enforcement and comedic standards alike) Schmidt and Jenko are called into the office of Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) who informs them--in a magnificently meta twist on his already-meta speech in the first movie--that the new formula isnt working. He wants them to go back to doing ""the same thing again."" Schmidt and Jenko protest (with a nice White House Down joke thrown in for good measure) but Hardy is adamant. The trappings may be different this time--college rather than high school a different synthetic drug to be tracked down a new church HQ across the road from the old one at yes 22 Jump Street--but he wants the duo back on script ""Same identities. Same assignment. Infiltrate the dealer. Find the supplier."" Having thus rebooted itself as a reboot of the original reboot 22 Jump Street never looks back--or more accurately the movie scarcely stops looking back long enough to do anything else.Self-referential irony is hardly a new gimmick having served as the underlying premise for such franchises as Scream and Austin Powers but rarely has it been indulged with such fervor. There are riffs on the last movies suspect chart on the popular/unpopular inversion that took place between the partners and on Jenko taking a bullet for Schmidt. There are ongoing jokes about the larger budget of this outing (""as if that could double the profits"" sighs Hardy) and whether Schmidt and Jenko should take a break from their relationship to ""investigate different people."" Past cast members return for expanded roles (Ice Cube) and brief appearances (Rob Riggle Dave Franco) alike. Theres even a cameo by--well Ill let you guess but its not Johnny Depp.Just when we fear that this may be shaping up to be one of many many ill-conceived comedy sequels ""22 Jump Street"" shows that the joke is on us. Fresh gags are rolled out as well on subjects from Dora the Explorer to Destinys Child to Cate Blanchett to Harvey Milk. Theres a wonderfully oblique reference to Annie Hall (one word lobsters) and arguably the most memorable inter-gender melee since Patricia Arquette corkscrewed James Gandolfini in True Romance.Like its predecessor 22 Jump Street is directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs The Lego Movie) from a script by Michael Bacall (with Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman) who again co-wrote the original treatment with Hill. The result is a sequel that while lewder and looser than the original retains its comfortable comic rhythms. Hill and Tatum again display an easy chemistry and newcomer Jillian Bell is flat-out terrific as the ill-tempered roommate of Schmidts love interest (Amber Stevens).22 Jump Street sags in places and a few minutes could have been comfortably shaved from its 112-minute running time perhaps by cutting back on the familiar bromantic complications between the leads. But just as the movie winds down into its preordained conclusion it offers up one more concentrated dose of hilarity with a credit sequence that is among the best bits in the film--and one that hopefully will lay to rest any question of another sequel. ""Nobody gave a shit about the Jump Street reboot"" Deputy Chief Hardy reminded his charges in his precinct-room pep talk ""but you got lucky."" Remarkably 22 Jump Street appears wicked and winking enough to extend that lucky streak.But lets not push it.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things.

John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides.

"22 Jump Street | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 22-jump-street ) 22 Jump Street (United States 2014) June 13 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli There are times when 22 Jump Street is borderline brilliant. Unfortunately those instances are outnumbered by segments that dont work for one reason or another. On balance the film has just enough to earn it a recommendation but with a little trimming to a too-fat running time and less focus on the action elements of the ""comedy/action"" label 22 Jump Street might have earned a place as one of 2014s most memorable comedies. As it is it will be remembered as co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Millers second-best film of the year (behind The Lego Movie). One of the strengths of 22 Jump Street is the way in which it plays with conventions and cinematic rules. It acknowledges that sequels are typically inferior retreads mocks the concept of a ""meet cute"" and takes the ""bromance"" idea deep into homoerotic territory. The screenplay also gets a lot of mileage from the notion of a 31-year old and a 34-year old playing just-graduated high school students. The humor as is often the case with big budget comedies of the hit-and-miss variety. There are instances however when its equal parts laugh-aloud funny and bizarre. Consider for example a fight between Jonah Hill and Jillian Bell that plays up an element of sexual tension. Then theres Ice Cube who has never been used more perfectly than here. 22 Jump Streets best scene features his reaction shot and its priceless. The movie picks up where its predecessor 21 Jump Street (a spoof-adaptation of the TV series of the same name) left off. Undercover mismatched buddy cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are sent to the new headquarters of Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) at 22 Jump Street. Their mission should they choose to accept it is to head off to college and bust the drug dealers responsible for a young womans death. While on campus they begin to lose focus on their goal when Schmidt hooks up with an attractive co-ed (Amber Stevens) and Jenko finds fulfillment playing football alongside his new best friend Zook (Wyatt Russell). 22 Jump Street suffers from a little too much reliance on a narrative that isnt all that interesting. At nearly two hours the film feels overlong with parts of the final half-hour in particular seeming protracted. The movies action sequences while often choreographed with tongue in cheek add to the padding. Early in the proceedings theres a scene in which Schmidt and Jenko navigate the top of a moving truck. Although intended as a parody of Fast and Furious-style stunts this scene (and a couple of others) isnt clever enough to work on that level. Beneath all its satirical self-aware trappings 22 Jump Street is first and foremost a buddy film just as its predecessor was. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum slide back into their roles like no time has passed. Their chemistry is smoother here than in 21 Jump Street perhaps as a result of the actors becoming more comfortable with each other over the passage of time. Ice Cube deliciously overplaying the ""angry black captain"" role steals every scene in which he appears; Lord and Miller cannily provide him with just the right amount of screen time. The newcomers - Amber Stevens Wyatt Russell and Peter Stormare (as - what else? - the big bad guy) - dont leave much of an impression but thats not surprising in a movie of this sort. The end credits sequence is worth staying for. In addition to featuring obvious digs at cross-marketing and merchandising it pokes fun at just about everything that Hollywood does wrong when it comes to sequels. As envisioned here 23 Jump Street is only the beginning of where the franchise goes next. 22 Jump Street is of a kind with its predecessor. Both movies have similar tones like strengths and comparable weaknesses. Lord and Miller seem to be working from the premise that ""if it aint broke dont fix it."" 21 Jump Street was a modest box office success so it might have been imprudent to change things at this time. Consequently for those who saw the 2012 production its an easy call whether to return to theaters for this one. 22 Jump Street doesnt do anything sufficiently different for it to earn or lose fans. 22 Jump Street (United States 2014) Director Phil Lord Christopher Miller Cast Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Ice Cube Peter Stormare Wyatt Russell Amber Stevens Jillian Bell Screenplay Michael Bacall and Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman based on a story by Michael Bacall amp; Jonah Hill Cinematography Barry Peterson Music Mark Mothersbaugh U.S. Distributor Columbia Pictures Run Time 152 U.S. Release Date 2014-06-13 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Profanity Sexual Content Violence) Genre ACTION/COMEDY Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre True Lies (1994) Kick-Ass (2010) Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) worse movies of this genre Whole Ten Yards The (2004) Man of the House (2005) Central Intelligence (2016) Three...better movies of Jonah Hill Wolf of Wall Street The (2013) Knocked Up (2007) Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) worse movies of Jonah Hill Watch The (2012) Sitter The (2011) Funny People (2009) Three...better movies of Channing Tatum Hateful Eight The (2015) Guide to Recognizing Your Saints A (2006) Haywire (2012) worse movies of Channing Tatum Vow The (2012) G.I.

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum age out of high school in a Jump Street sequel that doesnt mess with its successful formula. Sony Pictures In a summer of sequels -- 16 in all -- this weekend is the sequelliest offering blockbuster deja-vu (How To Train Your Dragon 2 AND 22 Jump Street) as well as a few object lessons in how to train your audience. One film goes all meta with its concept the other goes back to basics and for a change both approaches work. Metas the mantra for Phil Lord and Christopher Miller whore managing three franchises these days -- Lego Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Jump Street -- and whore going to have to get off the sequel train pretty soon. For the moment though theyre riding it in style. 21 Jump Street was already a been-there-done-that TV cop show parody a fact they reference by beginning the new film with a ""Previously on Jump Street ..."" recap followed by a meeting with Nick Offermans Deputy Police Chief who directly addresses the original low-budget stakes as the movie studio saw them ""Nobody cared about the Jump Street reboot"" he tells stars Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill ""but you got lucky so now this department has invested a lot of money to make sure Jump Street keeps going."" A lot of money that you can see on screen in a first-reel FX-enhanced chase sequence atop an 18-wheeler that has cars bursting into flame with production values justified by the first films 200 million grosses. ""Its the same case"" he keeps telling them. ""Do the same thing."" All to establish that officers Schmidt and Jenko arent very good at action heroics giving their captain (Ice Cube) an excuse to send them back undercover as verrrry over-age students. ""Same identities same assignment"" he tells them except this time in college not high school. In the first movie the joke was that beefy Tatum and nerdy Hill had to work together because high school had changed so much since theyd attended that they no longer knew how to negotiate it on their own. Tatums macho jock-ness didnt play well with todays socially-aware kids; Hills dweeb had no idea how to be in with the in-crowd. This film reverses that dynamic -- Tatum makes the college football team Hills back in nerd hell (though with unaccountable luck with the ladies) which isnt as naturally funny so the screenplay makes bro-mance jokes instead detailing a dysfuntional partnership that a college shrink perhaps understandably misjudges as a couples-counseling problem. Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who are themselves impressive partners at this point) know enough not to mess with a successful formula. They keep the self-referential stuff coming from opening to closing credits (with the latter taking sequelitis to its logical conclusion) with cameos movies jokes (an Annie Hall riff has a nice payoff) and even by pairing a cop-dissing young Ice Cube on the soundtrack with the middle-aged cop-supervising Ice Cube on screen. ""Its the same case"" he keeps telling them. ""Do the same thing."" A sequel rule to live by. i Jay Baruchel voices a grown-up Hiccup Horrendous Haddock in How to Train Your Dragon 2 which chooses to advance its story organically expanding the world and its conflicts. DreamWorks Animation hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Animation Jay Baruchel voices a grown-up Hiccup Horrendous Haddock in How to Train Your Dragon 2 which chooses to advance its story organically expanding the world and its conflicts. DreamWorks Animation The alternative though is to advance the story in an organic way and the How to Train Your Dragon folks take that route for their Part Two picking up five years after we last saw Hiccup who was then a teen Viking-Chief-in-training and whos now an angular considerably more sure-of-himself 20-year-old. Hiccup (voiced by a still squeaky Jay Baruchel) lost a leg in the first movie but hes adapted as has his rambunctious half-panther/half-lizard dragon pal Toothless who has that prosthetic tailfin. No big deal is made of this -- a fact that will likely thrill parents of physically challenged kids -- because whats happening this time is that our heroes are figuring out the world around them. In the first film Hiccup had what was essentially a childs task overcoming his own (and then his tribes) fear of monsters. With the fire-breathing beasties now tamed both hero and filmmakers can move on to more mature pursuits -- figuring out how to deal with an aggressor who cant be reasoned with for instance and appreciating the balance to be found in an environment thats admittedly fanciful but is gorgeously substantial as realized on screen. Hiccup will discover that with power comes responsibility and that the ones you love can make terrible even deadly mistakes. Heady stuff for a kid-flick though there are certainly precedents. Director Dean DeBlois has been saying this installment is the middle movie in a How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. Its clear that he took inspiration from the first Star Wars trilogy -- not a bad model for breathing new life and yes a bit of fire into one of Hollywoods more nuanced animated franchises.

"Too Fast Too Fun Too ... Two? << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Catching Up With the Cup  Next How Soccer Explains the Sports Page Facebook Twitter Print Movies Too Fast Too Fun Too ... Two? Sequelitis and 22 Jump Street by Wesley Morris on June 13 2014 Not far into 22 Jump Street -- like by the second sequence -- its clear the movie has a case of the sequels. Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) sits across from idiot narcs Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) and with maximal exasperation explains their ridiculous new case in terms that explicitly mirror the ridiculous demand for a movie sequel. The whole movie is just like that -- giddy with self-loathing -- and goes exactly where youd expect (college). The hub of the undercover operation has been moved across the street from the previous address -- a Korean church -- and Schmidt and Jenko return to the had-it-to-here command of Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). This being an acutely self-conscious comedy one of the guys gets a load of Dicksons blue-lit square of an office and exclaims that it looks like a giant ice cube. Really though it looks like somewhere Ice Cube would film one of his atrocious Coors Light ads. There is amusing expository talk of how no expense has been spared for this second operation and how the spoils of prior success abound. And its a little bit funny but youre nervous because it already feels as if the only way the movies going to survive itself is in quotation marks. Eventually Dickson explains that there has been a new death (a sweet young girl) by a new drug (WHYPHY) at a new school (MC State a.k.a. ""McState""). But before things get under way Schmidt goes on a wink-wink tangent about how the good theyre doing is even better as white protagonists because the victim was black introducing a new layer of self-awareness. On campus that layer thickens when he and Jenko playing twins (in the Schwarzenegger-DeVito mold) discover that they live across the hall from actual twins -- half-black half-Chinese all stoner -- called the Yangs played by the lackadaisical comedians Keith and Kenny Lucas. The movies preoccupation with twoness proliferates. The search for the drug dealer means Jenko gets to fall in semi-platonic love with a quarterback and fellow himbo named Zook (Wyatt Russell) while Schmidt falls for the dead girls stunning friend Maya (Amber Stevens). In the spirit of all things sequel Wyatt is the son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn; Stevens the daughter of the heavenly voiced radio host Shadoe Stevens. The movies at its best when it stops making fun of itself and like the first film gets at the peculiar real-world rituals and humiliations of the plots host setting. Now its Schmidt whos jealous of Jenkos thing with Zook (in high school it was Jenko who envied Schmidts popularity). It makes you wonder whether hes seen Maya. Of course she wants things to proceed casually which sends Hill home the morning after their first time in a well-done walk of shame Hes the only male in a courtyard gradually filled with chagrined-looking shoe-toting women. The school librarys deserted stacks house an anti-homophobic action sequence. And Maya for instance now lives with the dead girls shaming former roommate Mercedes (Jillian Bell) who goes on about what a thrill it is not-sleeping across from wild never-ending sex. Weve all been Mercedes. Generally the movies self-consciousness becomes mutual. You laugh because you laughed two years ago and two years ago you laughed in part because it was a shock to find yourself in the hands of this kind of gonzo physical and verbal wit. 21 Jump Street changed the properties of its source material An earnestly message-mongering TV cop drama had been carnivalized like The Sound of Music becoming Sister Act 2. The writers (Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman) and directors (a pre-Lego Movie Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) played up the shows kitsch and tweaked both its moral decency and eyebrow-raising premise -- Johnny Depp Holly Robinson Peter DeLuise and Dustin Nguyen looked a decade older than the students they were hidden among. Not once did anyone turn to DeLuise and say ""Jesus. Shouldnt you be working at this school?"" But the show made the narcs sexy and cool. Its the kids who were addled and troubled and weird. The movie reversed the dynamic and vacuumed out any preexisting social value and got it on the bromance bandwagon. But even the physical difference between schlubby Jonah Hill and hunk Channing Tatum was ripe for farce. Comedywise 21 Jump Street was on-trend. It wanted to mock the show but really it wanted to extract the gay undercurrents in the buddy movie and in 2012 the ground for that was fertile. Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg had a good time with their 2007 action satire Hot Fuzz. It was a seamless conflation of intelligent mockery and admiring embrace. The first Jump Street was perfectly calibrated in the opposite direction. It was canny about just how stupid to be. You laughed because it was aiming for lunacy and went well beyond it. The drug Schmidt and Jenko were trying to stop was called HFS -- for Holy Fucking Shit -- a poetically literal name whose visual and verbal explanation compounded the hilarity. At some point the narcs wind up on HFS. They experience one of the funniest highs Ive ever seen. Its the Rapture for anyone dreaming for say Darren Aronofsky to do Cheech and Chong. In the last year Ive seen passengers watching 21 Jump Street on planes -- or rather Ive heard them -- and have leaned over and gotten hooked all over again this time with no sound. As pleasing as all of this more-more-more might be its also less less wit less imagination much less time with Caroline Aaron as Schmidts unconditionally overbearing mom -- and lesser surprises although Jillian Bell really is a comic discovery threatening to hijack the movie with her deadpan vulgar schoolmarm act. All of Aarons scenes appear to have gone to Ice Cube who does nothing but bark his characters lines just inside a bigger doghouse one that pretty much resembles the premise of Ride Along. But Hill and Tatum are as committed to the nonsense as they previously were. Hills simmering demoralization and Tatums elastic stupidity remain perfectly matched. After the revelation of the tangential plot twist theres a moment in which Tatum runs all over headquarters laughing while Hill remains seated being laughed at. Its an over-the-top expression of their humiliation-humiliated dynamic that almost trumps the outstanding production design and editing used for their split-screen trip on WHYPHY. Still theyve outgrown these parts. Even in two years their careers have changed as have Lords and Millers. Mercedes gets a lot of laughs when she lays into Schmidt for looking like such a 30-year-old. In that sense the sequel surpasses the show They look too old to be playing guys who look too old for college. 22 Jump Street has the same writers and directors as the first film. But its not smart this time as much as it is clever and that cleverness tips into spottiness and cynical self-congratulation We have no more use for this series so why not just blow it up High school is a much more comedically fertile universe for adult relocation. There are more social norms to transgress more minds to blow. 22 feels as jaded as some college kids. Lord and Miller walk a fine line between shrewdness and smugness. Their smash Lego Movie from the spring erred on the side of the latter. It felt like an agnostic using corporate products to pay lip service to the joys of the individual imagination. These two are better at a kind of zippy contempt. The last summer comedy sequel I can remember mocking itself with comparable brio was Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me which is 15 years old. But Lord and Miller have a different ambition. They want to take out the superfluousness of the entire Hollywood sequel industry. Theyre not biting the hand that feeds them. Theyre laughing at the factory that makes the hands. 22 ends with a hint of 23 Jump Street and then doesnt stop. As the hypothetical ideas keep coming a kind of satirical morbidity sets in. Youre not watching elevator pitches. Youre watching the series finale of Six Feet Under a sequel death pageant. Its brilliant on the one hand and tiresome on the other. In order to commit this act of movie-biz terrorism Lord and Miller pretty much detonate their own film as collateral damage. They spent blockbuster money to stage a sketch-comedy prank.

Actors Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return to Metropolitan City to reprise their roles as officers Schmidt and Jenko respectively for a second go. This time around the budding undercover cops have graduated from their prior high school assignment and are moving to college to make a drug bust. Their mission Infiltrate the dealers find the supplier (and maybe some maturity along the way). So yes -- with few exceptions -- its exactly like last time. But thats one of the most notable quirks about Phil Lord and Christopher Millers ""22 Jump Street"" -- its self-reflexive nature shamelessly riffs on the notion that the flick is nothing more than a recycled formulaic follow-up with identical plot lines character types frames and jokes. The film errs on the side of being gimmicky but strong plotting editing and directing help make old or overused jokes feel fresher. Also new to this installment is a deeper look at the anti-bromance behind Schmidt and Jenkos partnership which cleverly matches the mapping of most romantic comedies. Its no ""Annie Hall"" but it lobs similar questions if you can believe it. The movie continues in the same vein as its self-aware predecessor -- the eccentric reboot of the 80s TV series ""21 Jump Street"" -- functioning more as a hybridized send-up than a serious endeavor. Just like the switch from high school to college one of the big differences here is expense -- another tongue-in-cheek joke the film touts nodding unabashedly from time to time at its souped-up production value star-studded stable of actors and (sometimes) frivolous authorial gags. From a generic standpoint the movie is successful. Audiences will revel in Hill and Tatums hilarious onscreen chemistry for this is a movie in which anticlimaxes deadpan pop culture references slapstick situational irony and blue humor reign supreme. From cheesy superspy scenes to action-packed football plays many of the films largest laughs come from its leading actors physical humor which is choreographed and staged to a T. As social commentary Hill and Tatum don their best college stereotypes to poke fun at frat life spring break and hooking up in the Millennial generation. Otherwise the movies biggest flaw lies in its glut of pop culture references -- specifically music -- that could alienate some fans this summer and especially so down the line if this franchise wishes to have more shelf life than the average generational cult hit. Though Hill and Tatum own the spotlight for much of the film a cadre of high-level celebs such as Diplo Ice Cube Queen Latifah Nick Offerman Patton Oswalt Seth Rogen and Bill Hader among others make appearances. Familiar but newer faces Jillian Bell The Lucas Brothers Jimmy Tatro and Wyatt Russell round out other chuckle-inducing spots. ""Jump Street"" knows you know about the predictability and cheapness of sequels and rip-offs -- and in this case to avoid the downfalls of other summer comedy sagas embracing that problem might have been the best move for this absurd unique franchise.

"22 Jump Street (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review 22 Jump Street (R) This sequel to the 2012 hit lives up to the original. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/12/2014 Editor rating 3 ""Do the same thing as the last time and everyone will be happy"" Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) tells officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) at the start of 22 Jump Street. Hardy is referring to their new assignment -- pose as college students track down drug traffickers and bust their supplier just like they did at a high school in the smash hit 21 Jump Street. But Hardy is also referring to the nature of sequels comedies in particular which often try to repeat the success of the preceding hit by trotting out the same jokes. ""Its always worse the second time around"" Hardy says the first of the movies countless meta-moments. One of the great things about 22 Jump Street which does for sequels what the previous film did for big-screen TV adaptations is that it incorporates all its fourth-wall jokes and references into an actual plot. Returning co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller may pack a joke into every scene (some of them inexplicable such as the anonymous stoner smoking from a bong glimpsed in the background of a hotel room fight; whats that guy doing there?). But they dont take the shotgun approach of Airplane and The Naked Gun pictures. They give you a real movie with an actual plot not just a framework to hang jokes from If the films opening 20 minutes feel a bit sluggish thats because the filmmakers are setting up an endless array of bits that will pay off later. Here is a crazy goofy comedy that builds in laughs and excitement as it goes along. Lord and Miller (who also co-directed The Lego Movie and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) arent just getting better at comedy Theyre getting better at pure action too. 22 Jump Street delivers on both counts and the effect is exhilarating (even the end credits are hilarious). The movie wouldnt work of course without the chemistry between Hill and Tatum an unlikely duo who share a tremendous charisma. 22 Jump Street pushes the buddy-cop/bromance angle as far as it can possibly go without edging into Brokeback Mountain territory -- the movie is on one level a platonic love story between these guys -- but the humor works because the characters are so likable. Hill who has earned Oscar nominations for his dramatic work but is primarily still known as a comedian is the semi-straight man to Tatums goonish clown and hes confident and generous enough to allow Tatum to steal the picture from him (although Hill gets the films funniest scene which involves the duos captain played by Ice Cube and a luncheon at the college). Tatum is noticeably looser and nuttier this time perhaps buoyed by a confidence brought on by the success of the first film. He also pulls off some impressive stunts (Jenko has apparenly learned parkour since the first movie). There are moments in 22 Jump Street when the filmmakers just let the cameras roll on Tatum to see what he does. The actor does not disappoint coming up with physical bits of humor that hint at an untapped flair for comedy (Tatum also gets the movies best verbal gag something having to do with Cate Blanchett which takes a few seconds to sink in). If 22 Jump Street doesnt come off quite as you-gotta-see-this hilarious as the previous film thats because weve been here before so the novelty is gone. The miraculous thing is that this follow-up works so well even though as promised the movie is practically identical to its predecessor (right down to a hilarious drug trip). Theres a running joke that never gets old about how the heroes have a bigger budget because sequels to profitable movies always get bigger budgets and the film makes great use of the extra cash. Instead of a prom the big finale takes place at an outdoor spring break bash in Puerto Mexico where theres a bar called ""Gringos Pendejos."" The camera doesnt focus on it but the name is there for those who are paying attention. Theres something going on at the edges of the frame in practically every scene of 22 Jump Street a testament to the care and attention to detail Lord and Miller bring to this potentially silly material and Hill and Tatum take care of holding the center. The chances seem slim but heres hoping we get a 23. Cast Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Ice Cube Amber Stevens Wyatt Russell Nick Offerman Peter Stormare. Directors Phil Lord Chris Miller.

The directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are fresh off this years The Lego Movie and theyre no longer just filmmakers -- theyre meta-filmmakers. They create almost nothing from scratch; their talent is for juggling tropes. They hit the same jokes over and over but theyre smart enough to know which ones will play the fifth fifteenth and fiftieth time. Here the overarching comic idea -- the Alpha Gag -- is that men of action are like seriously into each other. Youre meant to cry out ""Thats so gay"" -- but with delight instead of derision. The homo jokes are happily progressive. Undercover detectives Jonah Hill (Schmidt) and Channing Tatum (Jenko) are two years older which means theyre unlikely college kids instead of unlikely high schoolers. Last time they set out to trace the origin of a designer drug that was wacking kids out. This time they set out to trace the origin of a designer drug thats wacking kids out. But 22 Jump Street is the type of movie in which before you can say ""Its a repeat of last time"" Hill says ""Its a repeat of last time"" and both Nick Offerman (as ""Deputy Chief Hardy"") and Ice Cube (as the prodigiously surly ""Captain Dickson"") give nudge-nudge-wink-wink speeches on the subject of the task forces bigger budget. The directors and screenwriters (three credited Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman with Bacall and Jonah Hill getting a nod for the ""story"" such as it is) presume the audience reads box-office reports and is schooled in the idea of the almighty Hollywood ""franchise."" They get to poke fun at sequels and simultaneously make sequel money which is a great frigging gig if you ask me. The first half of 22 Jump Street had my preview audience in stitches but I laughed more at The Fault in Our Stars; the movie was like a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby picture if Hope werent funny and Bing didnt sing. An opening chase is a mistimed shambles -- the relentless quips slow it down. And it doesnt help that the film sets a record for poorly timed jokes. Early on someone does a Tracy Morgan impression. Then Schmidt professes an enthusiasm for poetry and his (improbably gorgeous) new girlfriend (Amber Stevens) starts calling him ""Maya Angelou."" The worst moment is when Tatums Jenko righteously explains that ""faggot"" is an unacceptable slur on gays. Its as if Marty McFly came back from the future and sabotaged the script. But either the movie got better or I got worn down. Maybe both. Jillian Bell -- best known for the series WorkaholicsA -- materializes as the contemptuous roommate of Schmidts girlfriend and delivers a great rapid-fire series of deadpan putdowns. An agreeably low-key actor named Wyatt Russell plays the golden-locked football jock Zook who takes an instant shine to Tatums Jenko. They give each other moist stares and marvel at how in sync they are. They sit by the goalpost at night and call each other ""bro"" and ""dude."" (I thought they were going to sing a duet.) Ice Cube throws a show-stopping tantrum. Theres a fun shot of the campus at dawn when rumpled obviously hung-over young men and women pass one another on the common holding their shoes heading wearily for their own dorm rooms. At its best 22 Jump Street is less an action comedy than a loosely plotted revue and though its not as witty as either Joe Dantes Gremlins 2 The New Batch or Edgar Wrights Hot Fuzz (in which the directors evinced genuine love for their chosen genres) its sure as hell better than a straight buddy-cop sequel. And the ultrameta epilogue (no spoilers) is irresistible -- it sends you home on a cloud. Tatum is a likably modest hunk and a deft comedian but Im on the fence about Hill. He so transparently wants to be regarded as a great actor rather than a great clown that he weighs the movie down. His brooding paranoid persona worked in This Is the End because he seemed to be poking fun at himself. Here he just seems ... brooding and paranoid. The chip on his shoulder thats visible off-camera is starting to show up on the screen and he should be careful before it grows into a Quasimodo hump of unpleasantness.

COURTNEY SHEA Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 13 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 13 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller Written by Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman Starring Channing Tatum Jonah Hill Classification 14A Year 2014 Country USA Language English Movies that mine movie conventions for laughs are nothing new The Oceans 11 series played playful homage to the old rat pack capers the numerous Scary Movies skewered all of the standard horror tropes Austin Powers was 007 with a twist. Even the specific concept of making fun of sequels while being a sequel has been done before in Scream 2 and that probably wasnt the first movie to make fun of coming second. The whole cinematic meta gimmick is so well established at this point that the next comedy frontier probably lies in figuring out how to be meta about being meta. Its enough to make your brain hurt which rest assured 22 Jump Street will not. ""Do the same thing - everyones happy"" says Nick Offerman (back like most of the supporting cast as the mustachioed deputy police chief). And if you do the same thing and make it even funnier well then right on bro [Fist pump chest bump totally superfluous and expensive explosion sequence].Plot is even less essential the second time around. Our dynamic odd couple - Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) - are still partners in policing. Once again they get a mission to infiltrate a drug ring only this time theyre going undercover as college freshmen. (Because you know the idea of two men in their 30s posing as high school students is ridiculous.) A bunch of the movies best jokes skewer the industrys habit of casting grown-ups as adolescents. Last time most of the ""you-so-old"" jabs landed on Tatum who really could be 45. This time Hill is the target. ""Tell us about the war - any of them"" says Mercedes (a scene-stealing Jillian Bell) the wisecracking roommate of Hills love interest Maya (Amber Stevens). (Side note one movie convention that goes unmocked is the tendency of pasty pudgy male writer/actors to cast absurdly good looking women as their love interests. Ding ding ding Jonah Hill.)College life on the other hand is milked for all its worth. In one scene Jenko and Schmidt take a roll call of the must-have items for dorm life including a beanbag chair disco light and ""a hilarious T-shirt that signifies we drink alcohol."" In another the guys endure a night of initiation humiliation. Jenko fits in naturally with the beer-guzzling jocks while Schmidt falls in with the pretentious art-student crowd. ""We like to drink good wine and talk about important issues"" says one wannabe-Sartre type. (If you didnt meet that guy at university you probably were him).In-jokes aside the awesomeness of the movie is the chemistry between its leads who go together like frat boys and dick jokes (22 Jump Street features plenty of both). Yes the writing is clever but much of the dialogue and physical comedy bits come down to delivery chemistry and Hill and Tatums ability to turn even the more juvenile gags (see dick jokes) into hilariousness. Particularly in the comedy realm showbiz goes through cool kid cycles - there was Wes Anderson collective the Will Ferrell posse Judd Apatows gang of which Hill is a member. That Stoner No. 3 from Knocked Up and the tank top from Step Up have become Hollywoods freshest comedy duo is impressive. That theyre keeping it fresh in a sequel is as close to a cinematic miracle as a guy in a ""Suns out/Guns out"" top to deserves to get.

Very soon into ""22 Jump Street"" the police chief lays out the latest mission for his undercover cops - pretend to be students and bust the pushers selling the latest designer drugs on campus. Just like last time they ask. Just like last time he says. And thats mildly amusing -- along with a few other nudge-nudge gags about how now theyve got so much money in the budget theyre wasting it on things you cant even see or that everything is always worse the second time around. Except at what point is sarcasm just a cheap substitute for wit? Exactly when does joking about how all sequels are just lame repetitive cash-grabs start to suggest that maybe yours is. too? Actually in this case about 40 minutes in. Still the stars have a nice rapport and a few good running gags. And it all concludes with a hilarious if literally last-minute montage of all the sequels to come (including one in which a star is replaced due to ""contract negotiations""). The sort-of-new adventure brings back smart but schlubby Jonah Hill and buff but bovine Channing Tatum as a couple of narcs this time assigned to college. Can they find the drug dealer whos killing kids? (Sure they can. Just like last time.) But directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller -- who did the last ""Jump Street"" movie as well as the sublimely superior ""The Lego Movie"" -- keep it moving and occasionally weird (with a giddy drug trip and a split-screen idea that seems like a nod to of all things ""Pillow Talk""). Which isnt that odd after all because the script -- by Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman -- has at least one wicked new idea which is to tease out the gay subtext barely buried in Hollywoods new bromantic comedies. So Hill and Tatum are partners in every sense but sexually squabbling like a cranky married couple over whos clingy or whos insensitive. And when Tatum befriends a fellow jock at college their conversations are ripe with innocently carnal innuendo. Theyre just you know not gay. Not that theres anything wrong with that. After all as the sweetly dim Tatum insists hes no homophone. All of this is funny (and proof again of the quiet career intelligence of Tatum who knows when its smart to play dumb and is canny enough to acknowledge some cross-gender appeal.) But there are a couple of missteps some accidental (who could have known this was not a good time to premiere a movie with a Maya Angelou joke?) and some just typical Hollywood -- like having a gorgeous college student fall for Hill for no good reason at all. And although Groundlings vet Jillian Bell turns out to be a very welcome surprise as the suitemate-from-hell theres an awful lot of comedy shtick that feels warmed over -- silly car chases comic fights and Ice Cube cursing unimaginatively as their cranky captain. Tatum continues to charm as an actor (showing here if nothing else that hes a hell of a good sport) and Hill gets in some nice half-muttered weirdness as his insecure partner. And that final-credits montage is terrific (I really want to see the one where theyre in dance school). But I just wish they occasionally taken their comedy a little more seriously instead of rushing to make fun of it before we did. Sarcasm is fine in small doses. But when you really start pumping irony sometimes the meta just gets well -- meh. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse and sexual references. 22 Jump Street (R) Sony (112 min.) Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. With Channing Tatum Jonah Hill.

"Review 22 Jump Street pokes its R-rated finger at everything -- hilariously - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review 22 Jump Street pokes its R-rated finger at everything -- hilariously A scene from 22 Jump Street Glen Wilson / Sony Pictures Jonah Hill left Ice Cube and Channing Tatum in ""22 Jump Street."" Jonah Hill left Ice Cube and Channing Tatum in ""22 Jump Street."" (Glen Wilson / Sony Pictures) Via latimes College freshmen Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go sophomoric in 22 Jump Street ""22 Jump Street"" is a monument to mocking a master class in dissing a parody of pastiche poking its R-rated finger at social conventions sequels stereotypes football frats friends drugs sex -- even its stars.In fact it is impossible to exaggerate how magnanimous its comic malfeasance is. This sequels spoof of its predecessors riff on the original 1980s-era buddy-cop TV show coalesces into a raucous raunchy irreverent imperfect riot. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as officers Jenko and Schmidt respectively are back for yet another capricious crime caper. Their chemistry crackles around strains in their bromance (look for an ""Annie Hall"" reference) and the fallout at the precinct from bungling any case they get.After a pretty hilarious opening that involves the partners trying to pass as Latino gangstas and a chase sequence that puts the films action style somewhere between ""Mission Impossible"" and ""The Three Stooges"" Schmidt and Jenko are soon shipped off to college. Their assignment per Nick Offermans Deputy Chief Hardy is to do exactly the same thing they did going undercover in a local high school in ""21."" Exactly. Just rewind repeat. Absolutely no thinking outside the box. Thats one of several jabs at the proclivities of Hollywood sequels. Thinking outside the box however is exactly what allows ""22 Jump Street"" to make a brash creative leap that somehow lands on its feet -- mostly. A scene from 22 Jump Street Glen Wilson / Sony Pictures Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum in another scene from ""22 Jump Street."" Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum in another scene from ""22 Jump Street."" (Glen Wilson / Sony Pictures) Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller -- the guys behind 2012s ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movies"" wry animation this year -- understand exactly what theyve got this time a solidly implausible story sight gags galore endless jokes for the two new freshmen to go sophomoric all unfolding at breakneck speed.Screenwriters Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman do not pull any punches or bypass any punch lines. More of the jokes work than fail. The script is not shy about being rude crude and politically incorrect with its comedy but that edge is somewhat softened by the sweet handling of relationships particularly Schmidt and Jenkos. Despite its general inappropriateness and occasional misfires ""22"" is not lazy in its scheming the crime of so many second acts. Related At 22 Jump Street premiere Tatum Hill fans cant stop dancing Amy Kaufman This weekend ""22 Jump Street"" is poised to have an impressive debut at the box office.

This weekend ""22 Jump Street"" is poised to have an impressive debut at the box office. According to those who have seen pre-release audience surveys the R-rated sequel could debut with anywhere between 55 million and 65 million -- more than 20 million more than the first film opened to two... (Amy Kaufman) As ""22s"" story goes the success of ""21s"" high school drug bust brought an infusion of cash into the undercover operation. The secret specialty division moved from the vacated church on 21 Jump Street with its giant Korean Jesus crucifix and its screaming Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) across the street to another vacated church with an even bigger Jesus this time Vietnamese. Dicksons still in charge his bite as bad as his bark. But the digs have gone from low tech to high tech the captains icy steel and chrome office looking as so much else in the film like a punch line waiting to happen. Indeed most scenes have something that looks like a set-up for a joke the crew is clearly in on. Cinematographer Barry Peterson another returning player has gotten increasingly comfortable with the mayhem. Production designer Steve Saklad more often found on Jason Reitman films brings his expertise at creating a sense of place which helps ground the film. Costume designer Leesa Evans has a lot of fun the ""22"" clothes have their own zany appeal. Mark Mothersbaughs music provides a peripatetic beat to match the pace and the plot; editor David Rennie helps stitch it all together.At college Jenko and Schmidt masquerade as students and siblings neither role remotely plausible. They share a dorm room as they work the case go to class rush a fraternity meet girls play football. Theyre after the dealer of a particularly toxic hallucinogen thats already killed one student.Their main target is known as the Ghost (Peter Stormare) because well no one knows what he looks like. But really the movies through line is how the best buds relationship is changing.The complicating factors are endless. There are unexpected issues with Maya (Amber Stevens) the smart girl Schmidt falls for. There are even more issues with Zook (Wyatt Russell) the college quarterback and frat boy who becomes Jenkos new best friend. Hes a suspect but their tight connection on the football field and off soon threatens the case and more. Meanwhile Mercedes (Jillian Bell) Mayas caustic new roommate turns up at the most inopportune times to deliver her verbal assaults. Bell is a scene-stealing crazy woman you wont soon forget.A great deal of insanity ensues none of which would work if Tatum and Hill werent so disarming in their roles. Their level of comfort with the characters and each other helps ""22"" click. That ease is on excellent display in one particular therapeutic scene.You might think the laughs are over when the credits start to roll. They arent. Hang around for a final bit of fun. From first frame to last ""22 Jump Streets"" low-brow is definitely and defiantly arched.Twitter BetsySharkey--------------------------------22 Jump StreetMPAA rating R for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some violenceRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Animation (Movie Genre) Jonah Hill Channing Tatum 22 Jump Street trailer Ice Cubes hot Hollywood career Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-22-jump-street-review-20140613-column.html,200,22jumpstreet17,22jumpstreet,latimes

"22 Jump Street laughs at itself again review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies22 Jump Street laughs at itself again reviewIf it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldnt possibly exceed their over-the-top buddy cop antics of 21 Jump Street the considerably zanier and even more self-referential sequel 22 Jump Street proves otherwise. Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum go undercover as college kids in 22 Jump Street.  (SONY PICTURES)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 12 201422 Jump StreetStarring Channing Tatum Jonah Hill and Ice Cube. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. At GTA theatres. 112 minutes. 14AIf it seemed Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill couldnt possibly exceed their over-the-top buddy cop antics of 21 Jump Street you lost that bet.They did it by doing the same thing only bigger in the considerably zanier and even more self-referential sequel 22 Jump Street.Article Continued BelowTheres nothing these guys wont do (or redo) for a laugh the bigger the better and as stupidly as possible.While everything is writ larger including the action sequences and the anger of the police captain (Ice Cube) its also mirthfully familiar. Hills Schmidt is still the bumbling dork to Tatums handsome jock Jenko. Theyre still going undercover as students to college this time instead of high school and trying once again to discover the source of a lethal new street drug. ""Im the first person in my family to pretend to go to college"" Jenko deadpans.This pair may be as dim as a small appliance bulb but they pass comedy chemistry class with straight As. Theyre also once again under the anarchic guidance of co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller the pair behind the lovable The LEGO Movie earlier this year.22 Jump Street may sound like an easy cash grab in yet another sequel franchise but Lord and Miller mercilessly riff on that very idea. This is serious meta mayhem always referring back to the fact that theyve already made this movie -- just as 21 Jump Street winked at how the film was recycling ideas from a defunct 1980s TV series.22 Jump Street is bookended by references to how sequels always get out of control and usually suck. Paradoxically these in-jokes are the funniest part of the movie as Tatum and Hill pose for one fake movie poster after another including a sci-fi sequel called 2121 Jump Street.Less hilarious is the humour that skates near the edge of bad taste and arguably goes over it the relentless jokes with a homophobic subtext and the scene where a woman gets repeatedly punched in the head by a man. (Sure she literally asks for it but its the lowest form of humour.)22 Jump Street gets a hall pass for including everybody in the extreme absurd humour including a supporting cast of famous faces (cameos abound) and not-so-famous ones.A big hello to Afro-Asian twins Keith and Kenny Lucas as mentally conjoined stoners Wyatt Russell as a jock who threatens the Schmidt/Jenko bromance and Jillian Bell as a caustic roommate who takes no prisoners.Bell soon to be seen in Paul Thomas Andersons Inherent Vice is the films most noteworthy addition. Her character Mercedes sees right through Schmidts fake student guise and wont stop needling him about being ""old"" -- even though at age 30 Hill is actually not that far off college age and a lot closer to it than he was to being a high schooler in 21 Jump Street.But the movie is ultimately owned by Hill and Tatum whose willingness to go for broke is infectious. Perhaps not since Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels in Dumb amp; Dumber have there been two actors so eager to compete with each other for a chance to look foolish.All joking aside about those fake Jump Street sequels though you have to wonder where on Earth these undercover cops can next cause mayhem since theyve pretty much exhausted academic options.I see a space station in their future and a 2121 Jump Street poster ...

Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill return in the absolutely expected sequel 22 Jump Street. Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures If theres any doubt that 22 Jump Street is a cartoon dressed in live-action clothing it should disappear completely when Channing Tatums lovably lunkheaded Detective Jenko is puzzling over an obvious set of connected clues when - DING - the answer suddenly comes to him. That ""Ding"" is literal - the sound is just an office noise from somewhere in the formerly abandoned Vietnamese church where his investigative unit is based. But it might as well be accompanied by a light bulb flickering to life above his head before he begins running excitedly around the office like Yosemite Sam with the seat of his pants on fire excited beyond measure that for once a thought has survived the leap between synapses. ""Cartoonish"" isnt a criticism here any more than it would be in reference to a classic Looney Tunes short. It just means that directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller feel no need to maintain any tether to reality or plausibility in service of a good gag. And these two are never at a loss for good self-aware gags - like the red herring tattoo emblazoned on a character who is exactly that. What worked last time in Miller and Lords unexpectedly successful 2012 adaptation of the 80s cop drama 21 Jump Street also works here. Thats part of the joke. Just as that movie made fun of its own existence by calling attention to the ridiculousness of rebooting an already kind of ridiculous TV show about adult cops posing as high school students 22 Jump Street recognizes its perceived status as a cash grabbing action sequel. Then it mercilessly mocks the tradition its becoming part of. Acknowledging the fact that theyre essentially ripping themselves off allows Miller and Lord the freedom of not having to try to hide it. The setup isnt just similar its identical demonstrate that Jenko and his partner Schmidt (Jonah Hill) are screw-ups send them to the angry Chiefs (Nick Offerman) office for a dressing-down and then on to their captain (Ice Cube) who continues berating them before sending them undercover to infiltrate a drug ring selling a new designer drug to students. The only difference is that the students that the pair have to pose as this time are in college instead of high school this time around. Miller and Lord have become so successful because theyre able to make dumb ideas into brilliant comedy simply by acknowledging that audiences arent as dumb as the industry often seems to think they are. In any other hands their Lego Movie could have just been a two-hour toy commercial big business exploiting childrens creative love of Lego for their own ends. Miller and Lord flipped it into a hilarious critique of exactly that idea. 22 Jump Street plays on expectations - specifically lowered ones -- of sequels just as effectively. That Vietnamese church is right across the street from the Korean church at 21 Jump Street that was the site of the investigations headquarters in the previous movie. Next to that site at 23 Jump Street there are construction crews already at work on a new building. With the recent announcement that Marvel already has their movie sequels mapped out until 2028 the implication couldnt be more timely. Inside the new HQ everything is glass and computers and ostentatious spending - Iron Man gets name-checked along with another sequel-heavy franchise James Bond. The Captain isnt any more subtle about calling attention to the units (and the sequels) newly increased budget than he is about telling Jenko and Schmidt that the assignment is exactly the same. The plot becomes incidental to the jokes only existing in service of them. Again thats not a bad thing; how many substantively different plots did Looney Tunes or Tom amp; Jerry ever really have? The ""breakup"" of Jenko and Schmidts formerly solid dude-bond is the central conflict here as they migrate to different cliques in their new college setting. But thats really only an opportunity for Miller and Lord to take pot shots at bromance as a genre trend as well as making the subtext of buddy cop movies into text with overt romantic comedy parallels. If its not quite as funny as its predecessor thats only because its not quite as unexpected. The directors know familiarity breeds tedium but try to alleviate that by just being honest about it. We know what sequels do and why. They know that we know. What separates 22 Jump Street from sequel mediocrity is that everyones in on the joke.

AP AP AP AP AP AP AP 22 Jump Street     Directors Phil Lord Christopher Miller Cast Channing Tatum Jonah Hill Ice Cube Rated R (strong language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity some violence) Running time 112 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 406pm on Thursday Jun. 12 2014 Thursday Jun. 12 2014 Thursday Jun. 12 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Remember that sinking feeling when you realized The Hangover II was just a pure money grab that left for dead the audiences love of the original simply so someone in Hollywood could buy another Tesla?Well thats not going to happen with 22 Jump Street a sequel that has as many laughs as a Texas spring has tornadoes.The whole thing -- from the mock TV-episode opening (""previously on 21 Jump Street"") to the wickedly inspired closing credits imagining future sequels -- is a beautiful surprise. Kinda like finding out someone has just deposited a thousand bucks in your bank account.It helps that the original directors (Phil Lord Christopher Miller) main writer (Michael Bacall) and the core of the cast (Channing Tatum Jonah Hill and Ice Cube) are back. It also helps that theyve returned with their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks. This silly movie is a whip-smart commentary on sequels in a summer season full of them. More than that though its just plain funny.Once again Tatum and Hill are Jenko and Schmidt undercover cops who -- after the death of a student linked to a new synthetic drug -- are infiltrating a campus to find out whos dealing. Except this time they are going back to college not high school. If that sounds suspiciously like the plot from the first film well thats the point.Jenko becomes a football star and finds a new BFF in teammate Zook (Wyatt Russell) who also happens to be one of the main suspects. Schmidt falls in wide-eyed love with Maya (Amber Stevens) who happens to live across the hall from where the deceased lived and has even taken in her former neighbors roommate Mercedes (a hilarious Jillian Bell Workaholics).All the while Jenko and Schmidts humorless boss (N.W.A.-mean Ice Cube not Are We There Yet? Ice Cube) is on their tails for results. Cube almost steals the movie with a brief but brilliant scene in a restaurant buffet line.But the Cube has a lot of competition for most memorable moment Hills version of slam poetry for instance. And the comedic chemistry between Tatum and Hill -- whether its in their wordplay or physical humor -- really makes Jump Street explode. While its easy to knock Tatum in other roles hes pitch-perfect here as the jock sidekick.It all ends -- as every summer sequel worth its stuntmen budget should -- with a big chase and shootout and that aforementioned promise of at least a decades worth of sequels. (Be sure to stay through the credits and keep an eye out for cameos.)Maybe it shouldnt be shocking that 22 Jump Street is as good as it is. After all Lord and Miller are responsible for the well-regarded Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and The Lego Movie. They have pop-culture smarts and a sense of visual energy and they seem to be on a roll.But they probably shouldnt push their luck with those ""Jump Street"" sequels. Anyone who sat through The Hangover Part III would agree. Cary Darling 817-390-7571 Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Cops take a crash course in college life. Directors Phil Lord Christopher Miller (152). R Sexuality language violence. Area theaters. Like any savvy sophomore this comedy sequel knows theres a trick to getting a passing grade. The biggest trick is the chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Their easy camaraderie gave ""21 Jump Street"" (2012) inspired by the 80s TV show a reason for existing. Their doofus duet is now more precise. Like Astaire and Rogers they complement each other. Tatum makes Hill an action star. Hill makes Tatum funny. After a brief scene in which Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) infiltrate a gang of Mexican drug dealers using cartoonish accents (it shouldnt earn laughs but it does) theyre assigned back to the Jump Street division -- at its new address across the street 22 Jump St. Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum in 22 Jump Street (Glen Wilson) This time Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are at college not high school. (Glen Wilson) Ice Cube left is back as the tough cop who must manage Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. (Glen Wilson) The guys are out in force as well as farce with the 22 Jump Street sequel. (Glen Wilson) Their tough sergeant (Ice Cube) has them keep the aliases they used when they went undercover in high school for a new assignment going undercover at college. Since nether has a higher education theyre psyched. ""Im the first in my family to fake-go to college"" Jenko says. Once there they have to find whoever is pushing a deadly new drug. Jenko thinks its his new frat-house bud Zook (Wyatt Russell) while Schmidt is sure its cooked up in the coed dorms where he hooks up with sexy Maya (Amber Stevens). Their hunt winds up in a wild spring break town filled with bouncing babes upchucking dudes and male bonding. Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum do spring break in 22 Jump Street. (Glen Wilson) That last point as much as the jokes is the crux of the movie. Schmidt and Jenko recommit to their partnership after spending part of the case ""investigating other people."" Its clear one of the things fueling Hills real-life apology last week for making an anti-gay slur against a paparazzo was the fact that ""22 Jump Street"" succeeds most as one big bro hug. The affection Schmidt and Jenko have for each other makes them as even Zook notes a perfect pair. When theyre apart they miss each other. But the laughs are what keep the film together even when the conceit feels been-there-done-that. Among the supporting cast Ice Cube has a barking blast. Especially with one riotously funny display of anger while at a buffet (it turns out Maya whos been dating Schmidt is his daughter). If theres a lack of freshness the movie takes aim at itself for that as characters make wisecracks about sequels never being as good as the original. Like its stars ""Jump Street"" gets extra credit for getting by on charm while sticking to the rules.

Entertainment ""22 Jump Street"" Is One Of The Most Self-Aware Sequels Ever Made With winks toward its sequel status its epic bromance and its cops-undercover-as-kids premise 22 Jump Street is the summers most self-mocking movie. And its even funnier than the first installment. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in 22 Jump Street Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures ID 3099529 Filmmaking team Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have now made a movie based on a 32-page picture book (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) another one based on a line of toys (The LEGO Movie) a big screen adaptation of a very 80s TV series (21 Jump Street) and a sequel to the same (22 Jump Street). These are the kind of projects that when theyre announced are viewed as signs of how creatively desperate Hollywood has become. Look what theyre trying to making a movie out of now But all four of the aforementioned films have been improbably and rousingly good proof that talented writers and directors can use any material as a launching pad for something entertaining and cinematic. Lord and Miller also have been getting more and more self-referential about making supposedly mindless studio movies from 21 Jump Streets constant winking at its cops-go-undercover-in-high-school premise (""You look really old. Were you held back?"") to The LEGO Movies have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too subversion of its giant exercise in product placement. But 22 Jump Street which hits theaters this Friday is Lord and Millers most meta effort yet. Its a movie that doesnt just continue to poke fun at its own setup but digs into the conventions of buddy cop movies and franchises spinning and spinning until it catches its own tail. It doesnt have the pleasant surprise factor of the first film but its actually even better. ID 3098805 ""Ladies nobody gave a shit about the Jump Street reboot but you got lucky."" View this image > Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures ID 3099781 22 Jump Street is first and foremost a sequel about sequels. Reprising his role as Deputy Chief Hardy at the beginning of the film Nick Offerman delivers the equivalent of studio notes to Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) after their attempt at a slightly more standard drug bust goes wrong ""Do the same thing as last time"" Its a refrain that continues throughout the movie as the dynamic-ish duo goes undercover again this time as college students. Schmidt and Jenko are using their old sibling aliases and are still living together this time in a dorm rather than with Schmidts parents. Theyre still looking to bust a designer drug ring with the new product in question being WHYPHY a combination of Adderall and ecstasy. And one of them gets a little too caught up in the life hes faking only this time its Jenko who tearfully notes ""Im the first person in my family to pretend to go to college."" How much of an obligation a sequel has toward being more of the same only bigger is an ongoing concern of 22 Jump Street. The movie even includes a hilariously unlikely in-universe explanation for its title and at one point suggests a characters probably the villain solely based on his being the rough equivalent of the villain in the first movie. (Hes not and 22 Jump Street actually manages to quite deftly balance being a sequel with being a movie in its own right.) Its a self-mocking tendency that reaches brilliance during the closing credits which I wont spoil other than to note that if 22 Jump Street willed itself into existence with the throwaway punchline of the first film then the jokes that make up the end of the second suggest Schmidt and Jenko are destined to be around for a long time. ID 3103877 ""Its just drinking games and bonding. Why is that so painful for you?"" View this image > Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures ID 3100398 21 Jump Street offered up the twist that seven years after graduating themselves popular doofus Jenko and nerdy outcast Schmidt discovered their social valuations had switched in a post-Glee teenage world in which the rules for whats cool were very different. Jenkos bullying and affected blase attitude no longer marked him as the top of the high school food chain while Schmidts nice guy quirk won him a spot with the cool kids and got him the girl (Brie Larson who sadly doesnt show up in this new installment). But college in 22 Jump Street is the place in which Jenko comes into his own as the ultimate bro. A sweet-natured meathead whos comfortable with the alpha male crew he finds frat life fits him like a glove quickly endearing himself to fellow muscled numskull Zook (Wyatt Russell) -- finally someone who appreciates his choice of accessories a puka shell choker barely able to wrap around his massive bull-like neck. Meanwhile Schmidt finds himself being too clingy for college hookup culture when it comes to Maya (Amber Stevens) the art major hes crushing on. The reversal happens because well it was Jenkos turn. (""If its like the last time youre going to have an awesome time"" he observes miserably as they settle into the dorms.) Women may pass through the pairs lives but the Jump Street films are all about the epic self-aware bromance between its two mismatched heroes how they actually complement each others strengths and weaknesses (the new movie throws around jokily obvious yin-yang symbolism) and how time and social pressure always threaten to part them. Theyre basically love stories just platonic ones. ID 3103879 ""Maybe we should just investigate other people."" View this image > Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures ID 3100587 The unspoken joke of the average buddy action movie is that it involves two macho guys bickering or getting starry-eyed over one another like a married couple a gag thats often had a sour edge -- see theyre not actually homosexual -- even as recent films have brought this dynamic to more and more exaggerated places. 21 Jump Street did its part playing into this trend albeit while making the subtext pretty close to the text. For all the yelling of ""suck my dick"" when Jenko and Schmidt squabble over whod be the hypothetical blower and blowee when they hide in a car from baddies by pretending to have oral sex Schmidt does accept Jenkos argument as to why hed be the receiving party. But 22 Jump Street finally closes the loop on the R-rated comedys increasingly uneasy relationship with gay panic jokes by having Jenko take a human sexuality class. After all whats college without a political awakening? Its a side storyline that leads to a pivotal moment in the plot in which theres open discussion of a slur being casually thrown around by one of the villains. (This sequence has gained an ironic edge thanks to Hills recent outburst and subsequent apology.) 22 Jump Street may still find the idea of putting its leads in compromising positions priceless but this bit manages to feel deeply gratifying an acknowledgment and refutation of the undercurrents in a lot of this sort of humor. In that scene and in a later one involving the idea of fight-that-leads-to-sex sex 22 Jump Street doesnt just confront tendencies of its genre it feels like it plants a flag for dude-centric comedies going forward. Thats not just self-referential -- thats some honest-to-god growing up. Not bad for a movie that still loves its dick jokes.

(Sony Pictures) By Ann Hornaday June 12 2014 Follow AnnHornaday In the annals of movies in which character pronounce ""annals"" as ""anals"" just to get a cheap laugh ""22 Jump Street"" approaches heights of sublime shamelessness. The hyper-self-aware follow-up to the equally hyper-self-aware ""21 Jump Street"" this is a sequel that wears its well-worn formula mocking inside jokes and gleeful taste for overkill proudly flying the high-lowbrow flag for audiences that like their comedy just smart enough to be not-too-dumb. As he did in the first installment Nick Offerman sets up the action in ""22 Jump Street"" with a barely discernible wink. As Metro City Deputy Police Chief Hardy he informs star undercover officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) of their new case having to do with a campus drug ring much like the one they busted in the first movie. Huffing and puffing about the idea of reboots he warns them ""Its always worse the second time around."" Not necessarily. ""22 Jump Street"" steers blessedly clear of common sequel traps even while brazenly committing so many of the forms sins. The plot here is remarkably similar to the first one with the guys infiltrating a college campus to bust the kingpin responsible for a new drug called Why-Phy (Work Hard Yes Play Hard Yes) which creates intense focus for the first two hours then a blissful hallucinatory trip. Once Schmidt and Jenko get to MC State though their roles are somewhat reversed from last time Jenko -- ""the first person in my family to pretend to go to college"" -- accesses his inner jock and becomes the hit of rush week striking up an instant friendship with a blond Adonis named Zook (Wyatt Russell). Hurt rejected and jealous Schmidt takes up with the schools bohemian crowd drinking red wine in the art building and romancing a pretty student named Maya (Amber Stevens). [Related 2014 Summer movie guide] As in the first movie -- which sounded so bad on paper but turned out to be a delightful surprise -- ""22 Jump Street"" features a hilarious drug trip some delish cameos and a steady stream of double-entendres meant to send up the homoerotic subtexts of so many buddy-cop movies. Granted Hill -- who wrote the script with Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman -- drives that last joke into the ground with Jenko and Schmidt at one point breaking up (er agreeing to ""investigate other people"") only to reunite for a climactic sequence of slapstick carnage set during spring break in Mexico. ""We dont have to put a label on it"" Jenko says earnestly when Schmidt questions getting back together. 1 of 40 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Summer movie guide 2014 View Photos Critic Stephanie Merry suggests 40 options perfect for whiling away a summer day or night.

The movie based on a bestselling young adult novel by John Green follows a teenager stricken with cancer (Shailene Woodley) who falls for a free-spirited boy (Ansel Elgort) set on teaching her how to live while she still can. James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. But the truth is the old-married-couple dynamic between the two men is still funny especially in the deft hands of Hill and Tatum who have built a comic chemistry worthy of Hope and Crosby -- or at least Lucy and Ethel. As before Tatum effectively steals the show with his note-perfect rendition of the naive muscle-bound meatstick. Informed that they have an unlimited budget with which to run amok he thinks they have ""Cate Blanchett."" After taking a human sexuality class he realizes how many gay slurs hes used in the past and confesses to Schmidt that hes sorry for being a ""homophone."" Its all in the delivery. And that goes for the movie as a whole again directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""The Lego Movie"") with sprightly energy and a keen eye for supporting talent. In addition to Russell who nails a hilarious scene with Tatum in which they flirtatiously bro out on a moonlit goalpost the filmmakers had the good taste to cast the comedy duo the Lucas Brothers as Jenko and Schmidts spaced-out dorm neighbors and Jillian Bell as Mercedes a deadpan debutante-type with a lethally funny mean streak. As problematic as it is lately to accept gunplay as a zany joke the action and violence in ""22 Jump Street"" always give realism hyperbolically wide berth. Lest anyone mistake the movies antic intentions the boys actually pass the Benjamin Hill Center for Film Studies on their way to decimating the colleges sculpture garden and robotics lab all the while delivering a running commentary on how much money theyre wasting for no discernible reason. (And yes ""22 Jump Street"" pokes fun of other movies including Tatums gratuitously destructive ""White House Down."") Much of the humor in ""22 Jump Street"" is in-jokey and broad including a funny end-credits sequence suggesting the myriad ways the still-fresh franchise can cannibalize its own concept and destroy audience goodwill. But the most enjoyable pleasures of this paean to summer silliness are the small ones like the little ""ping"" that sounds when big dim Jenko twigs to a crucial change in the relationship between Schmidt and irascible Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). Touches like that keep ""22 Jump Street"" enjoyably light on its feet even when its self-consciously treading old ground. With luck things arent always worse the third time around.    R.

Starring Channing Tatum Jonah Hill Nick Offerman Amber Stevens and Ice Cube. (Photo/Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 12 2014 239 p.m. ET 2 COMMENTS Sequelitis which can be a wasting disease if not a mortal one has struck twice this week. In the case of ""22 Jump Street"" the prognosis is also bright if you measure outcomes by box-office performance. (Laughs count too and the movie has plenty of them.) But the people who made this sequel to ""21 Jump Street"" including the co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have taken a different road to commercial success. Instead of improving on the original--not the television series but the 2012 feature which was raunchy and hilarious--theyve made basically the same movie with the same plot and the same jokes. Whos to say theyre wrong? The repetitions are meant as a sort of metajoke and it works well enough more often than not though heightened levels of raunch and chaos seem not so much meta as frantic. More Film Reviews How to Train Your Dragon 2 The Rover The Signal As before Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill star as Jenko and Schmidt screw-up cops and reluctant buddies who struggle with the intricacies of the undercover work theyve been assigned by Ice Cubes nasty Capt. Dickson. Instead of searching for illegal drugs in a high school where they were obviously over-age theyre searching for drugs in a college where they are obviously under-smart. Jenko has a good line--""Im the first person in my family to pretend to go to college""--and Mr. Tatum turns much of Jenkos material into droll comic moments; he has a gift for sweet-spirited naivete thats all the more pleasing in the handsome hunks he plays. Amber Stevens is appealing as Maya Dicksons daughter. Jillian Bell is funny at first then less and less so as a gimlet-eyed student named Mercedes whos got Schmidts number. An orange Lamborghini figures in the proceedings. So does an octopus and once again lobsters. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE ""Side Effects"" (2013) Channing Tatum Rooney Mara and Jude Law star in Steven Soderberghs sly thriller which deals with our fondness for mood-altering drugs. You should know that this film may provoke symptoms of elation along with some anxiety agitation confusion and low-grade skepticism. You should also know that the madness of Big Pharma peddling psychoactive meds on a staggering scale is only the starting point of a plot that pushes the principle of nothing being what it seems. In another sense though everything is exactly what it seems expertly crafted and cleverly compounded for high-dose entertainment.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 262915841 Might as well jump into 22 Jump Street REVIEW The ""Jump Street"" duo goes undercover on campus with a major in hilarity.  | 22 JUMP STREET 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune June 12 2014 -- 155pm Glen Wilson  Sony Pictures Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum go on a rollicking ride as undercover cops in ""22 Jump Street."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Bigger in budget grander in scope and proud of its own pointlessness ""22 Jump Street"" is a self-reflexive joke at the expense of overblown movie franchises. Its the sequel to end all sequels. The only problem Its so irresistibly funny itll probably spawn a trilogy. Once again thirtysomething cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are tapped to go undercover as students to bust a drug ring this time at a university. As Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) reminds them two years ago nobody cared ""about the Jump Street reboot but you got lucky. So now this department has invested a lot of money to make sure Jump Street keeps going."" Jenko whines about trying something original like ""joining the Secret Service and protecting the White House."" This reference to the plot of Tatums 2013 flop ""White House Down"" earns him a blistering glare. Just keep doing the same thing as before Hardy growls even though the partners can be sure that ""its always worse the second time."" The script takes gleefully satirical stabs at Hollywood. It ridicules the idea of ""doubling the budget as if that would double the profit"" while reveling in expensive car chases enormous spring-break crowd scenes and extravagant sets. The Jump Street divisions irritable Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) fumes at full boil about the waste he sees all around. He declares indignantly that their overblown new headquarters looks like something from an ""Iron Man"" movie. Still hes thinking of adding a shark tank. Rather than running from the deja vu premise returning screenwriter Michael Bacall and co-writers Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman embrace it. Amazingly they even make it meaningful. The cornerstone of both movies is the yin-yang partnership between clever insecure Schmidt and delightfully obtuse Jenko. Here like any couple in a mature committed relationship -- or sequel co-stars -- theyre stuck in a template doing the same thing over and over again. Their new assignment introduces troubling turbulence. Jenko joining the football team acquires a new trophy bro a young fit blond quarterback/frat king named Zook (Wyatt Russell who inherited great comedy genes from his parents Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn). Older frumpy Schmidt feels hurt which leads to a delirious session of couples counseling from the school psychologist. 22 JUMP STREET 1/2 out of 4 stars  Rating R for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some violence. Hill and Tatum play the bro-dependent humor straight-faced; the possibility that their longtime friendship could be lost really matters. Like the best comedy its funny because its somehow true. As the cop team starts to fall apart you genuinely feel for them. Tatum has a pure almost childlike delight in big silly jokes and X-treme stunts that defy the laws of physics while Hill shines at sly comic characterization. They complete each other. ""21 Jump Street"" alums Rob Riggle and Dave Franco make the leap to the sequel now prison cellmates locked in their own partners-for-life sentence. Promising newcomers include Amber Stevens as a student who introduces Schmidt to hookup culture and Jillian Bell as her acerbic roommate who hammers away at how wrinkly and liver-spotted the new freshman looks prodding him to ""tell us about the war -- any of them."" Several cameo pop-ins are inspired on a par with Johnny Depps appearance in the original movie. The directors of the first film Christopher Miller and Phil Lord deliver the same rambunctious energy and atomic-clock timing here. Gags fly by so fast theyre almost subliminal from a Benny Hill shout-out amid a car chase to an inspired end credits sequence that ridicules every possible Jump Street spinoff and toy tie-in. Stick around through the very end. The film saves its last laugh until the moment when the theater crew arrives to sweep up. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Except for Channing Tatum it is. Grade C- ""22 Jump Street"" may be the most arbitrary sequel since ""Bad Boys II."" If its not the worst thats strictly because of Channing Tatum. As half of a comic cop team who routinely go undercover in farcical academic settings Tatum kicks portions of the film to life with his big-lug innocence and impeccable delayed reactions. Hes superb at showing that his would-be super-cops better instincts click a half-minute to a half-hour too late. His embodiment of earnestness is so complete that he can make you laugh fondly at measly wordplay like saying ""Cate Blanchett"" when he means ""carte blanche."" Unfortunately Jonah Hill as his supposed smarter half gives into lazy hapless smarm and the movie as a whole is the apotheosis of self-reflexive adolescent junk. Whenever the cops discuss their redundant expensive undercover work were meant to know - wink wink or rather WINK WINK - that theyre really talking about this sequel. Its supposed to be hilarious whenever the heroes and their bosses acknowledge that theyre appearing in a derivative overbudgeted movie whose only point is to make money. Once again Capt. Dixon (Ice Cube) tasks Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) with finding the evil exploiter of a hot new drug this time at college instead of in high school. One more time Schmidt will enjoy surprising success with a campus beauty (Amber Stevens) - here he wins her over with a gutsy slam rather than a song from ""Peter Pan"" - as he and Jenko find their friendship tested this time by Jenkos bromance with a football golden boy (Wyatt Russell). As the boys and their bosses keep saying in their stupefying repetitive mock confessions the movie is over-the-top. But its not pleasurably excessive - its wretchedly excessive. By the time Jenko and Schmidt hang onto a helicopter flown by a bad guy named the Ghost (played by Peter Stormare who was also a baddie in ""Bad Boys II"") while thousands of spring breakers gyrate on the Mexican beach below the film has become a bad trip. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have supersized everything including the co-stars buddy-buddy shtick which now has two sets of air quotes around it. The mission the filmmakers have set themselves is seeing how many pouts in-jokes and intimacies their leads can share without anyone mistaking them for a gay couple except for the college shrink who naturally assumes they are (though theyre enrolled as brothers). Making a movie this ""meta"" carries some dangers. It becomes impossible to hear the newly sensitized Jenko lecture Schmidt about gay slurs without thinking about Hills recent use of the f-word. This movie constantly reminds you of its real-world existence as a just-for-profit product of todays decadent Dream Factory. But any time gritty reality intrudes it deflates the comedy even in a jocular reference to Tracy Morgan. ""22 Jump Street"" keeps exploiting wanton gunplay and juicing jocks and high-proof frat-boy hazing for schoolboy yocks. The script insists that this movie is expensive but nearly every laugh is cheap.

Clearly though hes also describing this disappointing sequel. ""As if spending twice the money guaranteed twice the profits"" he scoffs. A send-up of the hokey television show about cops and youth culture ""21 Jump Street"" proved a hit driven partly by fond mockery of the 1980s (series star Johnny Depp made a cameo) and by the unexpected chemistry between the doughy Hill and the chiseled Tatum. Directed with loosey-goosey energy by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""The Lego Movie"") who return here ""21 Jump Street"" struck a balance between pop satire and character-based comedy.

They replace the first films high-school backdrop with college then force Schmidt to note that its ""literally the exact same case."" There are a few inspired moments (Jillian Bell of HBOs ""Eastbound amp; Down"" plays a mercilessly sarcastic co-ed and Ice Cube gets to wig out as Captain Dickinson) but the movie is crammed with jokes about how bad sequels are. And guess what? Exactly. Theres another way ""22 Jump Street"" tries to have its cake and eat it. Hill recently hurled a gay epithet at a paparazzo and then publicly apologized which is basically what movies like this have been doing for years. As a bromance ""22 Jump Street"" is essentially one long gay joke in which straight males play their mutual affection for laughs then nod glancingly to political correctness. Here the jockish Jenko newly sensitized by a Human Sexuality class objects loudly to a villains gay slur. The best apology for that joke and for this sequel would have been not to make it in the first place.

Point proven. ----- MoviesSummers must-see movies TV COP SHOWS THAT BECAME MOVIES Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff ""21 Jump Street"" is one of the few TV cop shows that not only was turned into an arresting movie but it spawned a sequel. These other police series made into films however didnt land on anyones most wanted list. DRAGNET (1987) -- Just the facts This pairing of Dan Aykroyd (in Jack Webbs TV role as stone-faced by-the-book police Sgt. Joe Friday) and Tom Hanks as his laid-back partner was a criminal waste of both actors talents. CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU? (1994) -- The hilarious 60s vehicle that starred Joe E. Ross and Fred Gwynne as inept Bronx cops Toody and Muldoon was turned into this 90s junk heap with David Johansen and John C. McGinley. Dont ask what Toodys cries of ""Ooo Ooo"" now meant. STARSKY amp; HUTCH (2004) -- ""The Hangover"" director Todd Phillips helmed this big-screen parody of the 70s cop show with Ben Stiller as Starsky and Owen Wilson as Hutch. It nailed the decades bad hair and clothes and yet the TV series still seemed funnier. 209 Movies22 Jump Street trailer MIAMI VICE (2006) -- Michael Mann played it straight with this version of the 80s cop show with Colin Farrell as Sonny Crockett and Jamie Foxx as Ricardo Tubbs.

Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum in Columbia Pictures ""22 Jump Street."" Photo Glen Wilson Sony Pictures 22 Jump Street review A comedy classic 1 / 5 Back to Gallery 22 Jump Street Action comedy. Starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. (R. 112 minutes.) With movies sometimes the most important movements are the hardest to notice because they seem only natural just part of the cultural air. It took outsiders - French film critics - to take note of film noir and to recognize Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock as great directors. If something big is going on right now that were taking for granted its comedy. We get a good one every few weeks and the latest ""22 Jump Street"" is better than most. ""22 Jump Street"" is exactly what comedy is today. Its coarse free-flowing and playful. People talk the way they talk in real life. It has no sentiment of any kind and no phony uplift. No one becomes a better person for having watched it. Its made with an awareness of the past so you get subtle riffs on genre cliches from earlier comedies. And its really funny not ""heh-heh"" funny but laugh-out-loud funny virtually scene by scene. Its funnier than an earlier generations buddy-cop comedies such as ""48 Hrs."" though its not funnier than the memory of those movies - just as Seth MacFarlanes ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" cant compete with the memory of ""Blazing Saddles"" though its funnier. Eventually these new movies will become respectable right around the time audiences stop laughing at them. More in Movies How to Train Your Dragon 2 review Its Hiccup vs. tyrant Obvious Child Stand-up portrayal of abortion Supermensch Behind the Hollywood scene with Shep Gordon The sequel to ""21 Jump Street"" which was based on the old TV series starring Johnny Depp once again finds Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill as a pair of undercover drug agents. The last time they infiltrated a high school. This time they go undercover at a college. Otherwise the case is ""exactly the same"" as last time a point that the movie emphasizes over and over as an in-joke about the nature of sequels. The first clue that the new installment is on solid ground comes in the opening minutes in which Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) are chasing a group of smugglers. The stars are in perfect comic sympathy and a scene of the two of them riding on top of an 18-wheel truck resolves in a memorable sight gag - imaginatively conceived and beautifully executed. There are few throwaway scenes there just to move the plot machinery from point A to point B. Instead almost every encounter has its own comic twist as though the script were conceived as a series of skits. So when Jenko goes to his political science class comedian Patton Oswalt plays the professor reveling in that tenure allows him to say and do anything. And when our heroes need help on the case they get advice from the man they put in jail last movie - played by Rob Riggle in a demented and very funny cameo. Throughout ""22 Jump Street"" their fellow students keep recognizing the undercover cops as 30-year-olds reminding us of the absurdity of the entire premise. Along that line theres a particularly good running gag in which Schmidt (Hill) keeps getting castigated by his girlfriends nasty roommate (Jillian Bell) for looking like Methuselah. Ice Cube is back as the guys perpetually exasperated superior officer but as with everything in ""22 Jump Street"" the filmmakers take a cop-movie cliche and blow it up so that Cubes exasperation is of epic dimension. He has a terrific set piece in which he flies into a rage at a buffet. The movies one flaw a common one is that about 25 minutes before the finish it slows down. It loses velocity and starts going through the motions for a patch of 10 or 12 minutes but then it revives. The end credits sequence in which they preview future sequels (such as ""30 Jump Street"") is worth a look. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Glen Wilson This image released by Sony Pictures shows Jonah Hill from left Ice Cube and Channing Tatum in Columbia Pictures ""22 Jump Street."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Glen Wilson) Glen Wilson This image released by Sony Pictures shows Jonah Hill left and Channing Tatum in Columbia Pictures ""22 Jump Street."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures Glen Wilson) Comedy sequels are funny. Not funny ha-ha but tricky. Even Dr. Evil with a flux capacitor and a slime blower couldnt brainwash me into forgetting the horror of ""The Hangover Part 2.""Some of the most successful comedy sequels are animated such as the recent ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2."" That toon was spearheaded by the team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who are also making a sequel to ""The Lego Movie."" The writer/directors cheeky attitude toward commercialism gooses the live-action sequel ""22 Jump Street"" but the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is its driving force.The movie starts with the words ""Previously on 21 Jump Street..."" followed by a montage of scenes from the first episode. Were reminded that brainy Schmidt (Hill) and brawny Jenko (Tatum) were teamed to go undercover and bust a drug ring at a high school. Now their unit has literally moved across the street where gruff Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them a similar case at a local college. ""Similar"" as in ""exactly the same."" Although references to reboots and sequels are a recurring theme here the movie doesnt double down on deja vu. After Schmidt and Jenko move into the college dorm (as the dissimilar McQuaid brothers) ""22"" works on its own terms. To find the source of the drug ""why/phy"" (""work hard yes; play hard yes"") the 30-ish freshmen reluctantly agree to ""investigate other people"" with Jenko joining the football team and Schmidt infiltrating the slam-poetry scene. (Tabloid-TV viewers will note that Schmidts tirade against homophobic language has real-world reverberations as do references to Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan.) Schmidts investigation leads him to the bed of art student Maya (Amber Stevens) while tight end Jenko goes deep for quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell son of Kurt). Of course in college all roads lead south to a spring-break bacchanal. The Mexican mash-up of ""Neighbors"" and ""Spring Breakers"" is the cherry on this pina colada with Schmidt complaining that the action-hero antics are busting the budget.A self-aware sequel has to hop over hurdles to keep from swallowing its own tail but the sharp writing and tag-team antics lift ""22 Jump Street"" to a high level.

How so? Because 22 Jump Street explodes the whole concept of franchise filmmaking and then studies the shards to figure out why audiences are always panting to see the same damn thing over and over. More News 21 Jump Street Channing Tatum is Surprisingly Funny in 21 Jump Street Summer Film Preview 2014 The Season of Fierce All Stories >> Sorry. Im not trying to make a term paper out of a throwaway summer farce. 22 Jump Street is damn funny sometimes outrageously so. It laughs at its own dumb logic and invites us in on the fun. Look at the title 22 Jump Street refers to the new address where undercover cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) still take orders barked by Capt. Dickson (a priceless Ice Cube). But headquarters has moved across the street. 21 Jump was fronted by a Korean Jesus. The new hightech HQ at 22 Jump features a Vietnamese Jesus outside. The captain angry and clueless as ever no longer thinks the thirtyish Schmidt and Jenko can pass for high schoolers. So wait for it he sends them to college to nail a drug syndicate. That they dont fit in is a given. That were basically watching the same movie we did the last time is a fact of sequel life. That we dont mind so much is due to several factors starting with Hill and Tatum a comic team capable of breathing life into atrophied buddymovie cliches that were already old when Johnny Depp starred in the cheesy 1980s TV series. As stars and co-producers of the movie Hill and Tatum (Hill co-wrote the story) are in on the joke and happily willing to mock their respective images. Hill a two-time Oscar nominee (Moneyball The Wolf of Wall Street) kids his thespian side by having Schmidt hang with the arts crowd and hook up with poetry-loving Maya (Amber Stevens) whose roomie Mercedes (a scene-stealing Jillian Bell) mercilessly rides him as a geriatric loser. Tatum ever the jock busts loose when Jenko joins the football team and gets all man-crushy with blondie quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell the talented son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn). The real bromance of course is Schmidt and Jenkos echoing the college friendship of returning directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The Lego Movie). These lords of mischief know their brutal sequel-baiting wouldnt be worth much without characters to root for and the right actors to give them humor and heart. But darn its great to see Hollywoods addiction to recycling get royally skewered. From the opening stunt on an 18-wheeler to a spring-break rager everything is bloated to the max. And a scarily hilarious coda that rolls out ideas for endless Jump Street follow-ups is alone worth the ticket price. They say you always hurt the thing you love. Thanks to this team of merry pranksters 22 Jump Street hurts so good. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

"22 Jump Street movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review 22 Jump Street  Video Phillips on 22 Jump Street The sequels fun too CHicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews 22 Jump Street. CHicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews 22 Jump Street. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The peculiar sweetness of ""21 Jump Street"" has taken a hiatus in ""22 Jump Street"" a brazen sequel thats both slightly disappointing and a reliable often riotous ""laffer"" in the old Variety trade-magazine parlance. No question about it I laffed more at the little things -- Channing Tatum trying to cut glass with a laser pointer for example -- than the brawls.And now its crow-eating time. For a long time I misjudged Channing Tatums abilities; not too many films ago I assumed hed always be luckier than he is talented. But the former dancer was and is smart enough to work with filmmakers -- Steven Soderbergh on ""Haywire"" and ""Magic Mike"" or Bennett Miller on the forthcoming ""Foxcatcher"" -- who have helped him figure out how to communicate on camera effectively. Two summers ago ""21 Jump Street"" didnt hurt Tatum either. His fortuitous pairing with Jonah Hill on that clever satiric reboot of the undercover-cops TV series made him an even hotter commodity. Now we have the sequel directed once again by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller working from a script by Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman. In a hit-and-run movie like this the throwaway jokes are the ones youre glad they kept. Why is there an ""Annie Hall"" reference? What good does a six-second Benny Hill tribute possibly do ""22 Jump Street""? Theres no reason a sequel containing this many gags about how lame sequels usually are should work at all. But Lord and Miller turn their comic approach into a religion the Church of Self-Referentialism.In the first movie Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) infiltrated a high school to root out a designer drug dealer. ""22 Jump Street"" tests the bond of this police partnership when the boy-men are assigned to work undercover again as brothers this time at a college where a new designer drug has claimed at least one life. The best idea in the first movie was its simplest. Watching the insecure bully Jenko cope with the newly tolerant high school ecosystem of the present day meant the character had someplace to go. Schmidt by contrast the perpetual misfit suddenly found himself in with the in-crowd of dorks and nerds and liberal arts misfits newly ascendant in the social firmament.In ""22 Jump Street"" theyre back in their familiar grooves for better or worse. An instant star on the college football field Jenko falls into a fast friendship with a fraternity god and potential suspect played by Wyatt Russell (son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn). Meanwhile Schmidt lands in clover with art student Maya (Amber Stevens) whom he meets at a campus open-mike event where he dazzles/confuses her with his improvised slam poetry rhyming ""Jesus cried"" with ""Runaway Bride."" Ice Cube returns angrier than ever (for a shrewdly plotted reason) as the boys superior officer.The best of the movie which tacks on a spring-break climax filmed in Puerto Rico works incrementally and off-the-plot paying its biggest dividends the closer it sticks to the college dorm. Across the hall from Jenko and Schmidt theres another brother act this one with real brothers the hilarious identical twins and comedians Kenny and Keith Lucas who treat the movie to a ""jinx you owe me a Coke"" routine that is truly wonderful. (I couldve watched these two all night.) A frat-house break-in becomes a string of lovely stupid bits contrasting Jenkos reckless stupidity with Schmidts safety-first ethos. Be sure to hang around for the closing credits which imagine all sorts of ""Jump Street"" sequels to come all of which look funnier than ""A Million Ways to Die in the West.""mjphillipstribune.com ""22 Jump Street"" - 3 starsMPAA rating R (for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some violence)Running time 151Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Channing Tatum Reviews 21 Jump Street (movie) Jonah Hill Goldie Hawn Magic Mike Latest movie reviews Review How to Train Your Dragon 2  1/2 Review Supermensch The Legend of Shep Gordon  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-22-jump-street-review-20140612,0,7660915.column",200,22jumpstreet32,22jumpstreet,chicagotribune

Or in the immortal word of Texas Governor Rick Perry ""Oops."" A lot of movie comedies have parlayed the cover-up into an aesthetic. They anticipate and deflect complaints about their lack of originality by acknowledging it. They make fresh jokes about a stale idea and youre meant to think not ""How lame is that?"" but ""How cool is that"" Long ago critics described this tendency as self-referential -- and sometimes if the film took its tone too seriously self-reverential. Now though its ""meta"" a much savvier-sounding tag. And until now the king of meta comedy was the 2012 big-screen version of the 1980s TV show 21 Jump Street which mastered the trick of both living inside the cliche and mocking it. (READ Richard Corlisss review of 21 Jump Street the movie) Recognizing the absurdity of the premise -- rookie cops infiltrating a high school by passing as 17-year-olds -- screenwriter Michael Bacall and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller turned it into a buddy comedy with Channing Tatum as Jenko the dim-witted jock thrilled to return to his days of glory and Jonah Hill as Schmidt the nerd forced to relive his adolescent years of shame. Lord and Miller (who also directed this years meta-meta The Lego Movie) supervised a clever blending of two old genres -- one that was at pains to set itself above the TV shows churning solemnity. Hill tipped viewers to the strategy/scam by saying early in the film ""All they do is recycle shit from the past ... and expect us not to notice."" Audiences noticed laughed approved and helped 21 Jump achieve a 200 million worldwide gross on a 40 million budget. (READ James Poniewozik on 21 Jump Street the TV show and the movie) The inevitable follow-up 22 Jump Street really goes meta on your ass its best gags are about its being a sequel. The movie begins with a stentorian voice announcing ""Previously on 21 Jump Street ..."" And since the first films title was the address of a police station the sequel obliges the cops to move across the street to new headquarters. (Next to the old station we briefly spot condominiums under construction at ""23 Jump Street."") Sending Jenko and Schmidt to college where the tuition is much higher annoys their captain (Ice Cube) who warns against the conventional wisdom that ""doubling the budget guarantees twice the profit."" Like with a more expensive movie sequel. But you already got that. So far so smart -- you and the movie. Things get divinely crazier during the closing credits which shows clips from more than a dozen Jump Street sequels from 23 into the 30s. (Stay until the very end.) In between Tatum gets to allude to his role in White House Down Jenko wants to become a Secret Service agent and guard the President. And Hill gets involved in some tortuous emotions that seem pretty effeminate. Its chronologically impossible but if these scenes were intended to soften the angry response to Hills recent homophobic slur that would be meta to the max. (READ Nick Gillespie says Dont Accept Jonah Hills Apology) The problem is that nearly two hours of rationalizing repetition even by winking at it can get wearying. We get the same drug-investigation plot as the first films just with different suspects (including the jock ingratiatingly played by Wyatt Russell son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell). For long stretches as Jenko takes part in fraternity and football shenanigans 22 Jump Street wanders over to Zac Efrons frat house in Neighbors and moves in. Toward the end it channels Spring Breakers though in Mexico not Tampa and without the Harmony Korine movies clinical comedic insanity or James Francos hallucinogenic work as a zonked-out drug pimp. (READ Richard Corlisss review of Spring Breakers) The best comic turns are by the Afro-Asian twins Keith and Kenny Lucas whose timing is eerie and superb and by Jillian Bell as Mercedes the grouchy roommate of Schmidts new girlfriend (Amber Stevens). Mercedes is instantly onto Schmidts geriatric status saying he ""looks like a 30-year-old eighth-grader."" Hill has a few fine moments trying to fit in with the younger undergraduates -- ""Im just exhausted from inventing Facebook"" he claims ""or whatever kids our age are using"" -- and Tatum flashes a modest comic ingenuity that has been praised a little too fulsomely. One thinks of Samuel Johnsons comment on female preachers. Its a surprise that Hollywoods favorite hunk does comedy but he doesnt do it all that well. Neither this time do Lord and Miller. It is their peculiar triumph that they not only beat a dead horse but got it on its legs and entered it in the Belmont Stakes. Our minority observation the favorite got flogged too many times and finished out of the money. Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Phil Lord and Chris Millers 21 Jump Street adapted an 80s nostalgia property into a comedy about adaptations of nostalgia properties. Fittingly its sequel 22 Jump Street is a comedy about sequels. Like its predecessor the movie continually teeters on the edge of breaking through the fourth wall. Told to ""do the exact same thing as last time"" to ensure that ""everyone is happy"" undercover cops Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are moved into new headquarters directly across from 21 Jump Street at a Vietnamese church called Resurrection Of The Holy Spectacle. From the opening title (""Previously on 21 Jump Street"") to the closing credits (which showcase imaginary future entries in the ""franchise"") the movie mines blockbuster sequels tendency to recycle formula while being ""way more expensive for no reason"" for comedy. Again Schmidt and Jenko must pretend to be teenagers to find the source of a synthetic drug. Again they get over-involved in student life. The slightness of the tweaks--theyre in college now and Schmidt is the social outcast--becomes a running gag. Whenever Schmidt and Jenko attempt to deviate from formula theyre told by their superiors Dickson (Ice Cube) and Hardy (Nick Offerman) to just stick to what they did last time--a tactic that consistently leads them to focus on the wrong clues and the wrong suspects.  The budget is constantly invoked; at one point Schmidt and Jenko are told that ""the department""--22 Jump Streets stand-in for the studio--spent most of their funding on the opening sequence and the new headquarters set meaning that they have to conduct the rest of ""the investigation"" as cheaply as possible which leads to a car chase where our heroes are dismayed to find the villains crashing through increasingly more expensive set pieces.The movie occasionally resembles a modern answer to the deconstructed musical comedies of Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson the zoot suit-clad musicians-turned-comedians whose stage shows were adapted into a handful of schizoid movies--including the cult classic Hellzapoppin--and the weirdest show of TVs early years Fireball Fun-For-All. And true to Olsen and Johnsons shtick 22 Jump Street is kind of a mess. Like Lord and Millers The Lego Movie its peppered with throwaway gags a sped-up chase in front of the Benjamin Hill Center For Film Studies; a plot twist involving a sports team called the Plainview Red Herrings; a Mexican tourist-trap bar called Gringo Pendejos. Replicating the elasticity of animation in a live-action film takes considerable formal chops. Without them reality-bending jokes can often feel shambolic.Ironically 22 Jump Street is kept together by the formula it ceaselessly mocks. Hill and Tatums well-developed comic personalities and overtly emotional relationship give shape to the jokes and the latters sweet-natured doofus persona accounts for many of the movies best laughs from his inability to remember the word ""library"" (""book ...place"") to his severely delayed reaction to a plot twist.

This time its college. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 5 p.m. MST June 11 2014Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great chemistry in this sequel which is hilariously self-referential making jokes about the lameness of sequels even while producing lots of laughs.Channing Tatum (right) and Jonah Hill in ""22 Jump Street.""(Photo Sony Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsHill and Tatum share a great chemistry.The joke in the movie is that the plot is identical to the first film.Hill is always funny but Tatum has grown into a terrific comic actor.Near the beginning of ""Muppets Most Wanted"" the furry critters sing a song called ""Were Doing a Sequel"" about how the second film is never as good as the first.Might as well acknowledge the obvious right?Qamp;A Tatum Hill on their sequel satireIn ""22 Jump Street"" directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller take that concept about 100 steps further never letting the audience forget that this is indeed a sequel to ""21 Jump Street"" the 2012 hit that was in turn based on the old Fox show that helped make Johnny Depp famous. The movie is relentlessly self-referential with endless jokes about how things are always worse the second time around.David Letterman used to talk about how if you had a bit that was funny you keep riding it until it either dies completely or becomes hilarious.Happily for all involved the latter proves true in this film. The running joke is that police officers Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) are simply copying what happened in the last film when they went undercover at a high school to bust a drug ring. And they are.2014 Summer movie guideWell there are a couple of differences. For one this time they go to college. Theyre trying to find the dealer of a new synthetic drug. But what theyre really trying to do and they succeed wildly is continue one of the better modern-day bromances in film.And this time Jenko gets to be the cool kid reversing the role reversal from the first movie. Schmidt doesnt make the grade with the cool crowd but he does manage to date a nice woman (Amber Stevens) who definitely comes with strings attached.Ice Cube is back as Jenko and Schmidts ill-tempered boss Dickson. (He gets an upgraded office which the guys observe looks like a cube with ice in it. If you dont think thats funny this movie is going to be tough sledding.)5 ESSENTIAL FILMS Channing TatumJenko and Schmidt have their friendship tested when the former becomes fast friends with Zook (Wyatt Russell) -- they have everything in common. Except that he might be their suspect. So our heroes must grow apart then be thrown back together again winking and nodding all the while.Miller and Lord who also directed ""The Lego Movie"" from earlier this year specialize in a type of meta-moviemaking where part of the joke is the act of making a joke and making sure everyone notices. That sort of thing abounds in ""22 Jump Street"" but there is plenty of room for good ol raunchy humor and slapstick.What makes it all work is the chemistry between Hill and Tatum which in turn of course is a rich source of the films humor. Theres an underlying sweetness to their relationship. Hill who lets not forget has two Oscar nominations has been funny since ""Superbad"" but Tatum has become a terrific comic actor. In one scene he makes a discovery -- no telling what -- and runs around screaming about it and its hilarious.Theres a clever bit at the end imagining further sequels with a cameo that if not quite as inspired as the one in the first film is certainly close.""22 Jump Street"" is ultimately a celebration of the silly and the sweet a combination thats welcome again and again.Review 22 Jump Street 4 starsDirectors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.Cast Channing Tatum Jonah Hill Ice Cube.Rating R for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some violence.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"22 Jump Street starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up 22 Jump Street Can the Bromance Survive Without Bromophobia? 22 Jump Street Can the Bromance Survive Without Bromophobia? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 11 2014 757 PM 22 Jump Street Can the bromance survive without bromophobia? By Dana Stevens Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in 22 Jump Street. Photo by Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. 22 Jump Street directors Chris Miller and Phil Lords follow-up to their hit 2011 buddy-cop comedy 21 Jump Street (itself inspired by an 80s TV series) critic-proofs itself from the first scenes by foregrounding and mocking its own status as a crassly opportunistic sequel. As our heroes incompetent junior officers Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) are assigned by their perennially angry supervisor Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) to a case that resembles their last mission Dickson grumbles ""Weve doubled the budget as if that would double the profit."" Later a police higher-up played by Nick Offerman warns the boys not to expect the surprise success they enjoyed on their last big bust ""Its never as good the second time."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Disarming potential criticism by proudly brandishing ones own laziness Its a well-worn class-clown move and 22 Jump Street (scripted by Michael Bacall Rodney Rothman and Oren Uziel) is a genial class clown of a movie. It doesnt put in quite as much effort as its (already underachieving) predecessor and it coasts some on its charm but its fun enough company that youre willing to forgive it a lot--even the mild strain of homophobia that underlies its (and maybe every?) bromance premise. But well get to 22 Jump Streets subterranean sexual anxieties in a minute. Above ground its a goofy pseudo-thriller that transposes the last films high school drug-ring story onto a college campus leaving virtually every other detail the same. This time the fictional synthetic superdrug is called Whyphy (pronounced ""Wi-Fi"" a fact the marginally literate Jenko struggles to grasp). Jenko and Schmidt must reassume their previous fake identities--un-lookalike brothers Doug and Joey McQuaid--to pose as students infiltrate the university and find whoever is behind the manufacture and distribution of this insidious substance. (At one point our cops are unknowingly dosed with the drug resulting in a clever split-screen psychedelic scene during which the neurotic Schmidt forcibly drags the laid-back Jenko from the good-trip to the bad-trip side.) Advertisement As their fake freshman year of college wears on Jenko and Schmidts friendship forged over the course of the last movie begins to grow strained. The jockish Jenko finds a soul mate in frat bro Zook (Wyatt Russell son of Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn whos inherited his parents leonine beauty as well as their comic flair). Zook asks for nothing from life but a spot on the varsity football team long hours lifting in the gym with his bros and a steady stream of weekend ragers. Its a philosophy with which Jenko vibes so deeply that he neglects to pursue leads that may link Zook to the drug ring. Worse still (at least by the lights of this movie which privileges the friendship plot over the crime-fighting story) Jenko starts to blow off his lonely partners text invitations to hang out. The socially awkward Schmidt is clearly wounded by his pals abandonment but he distracts himself by courting slinky art student Maya (Amber Stevens) at one point delivering a memorably terrible slam poetry performance to impress her. As the two friends drift in different directions their tense encounters begin to resemble breakup conversations ""Maybe we should investigate other people"" suggests Jenko in one charged moment. Theres even a couples-therapy scene that plays on the double meaning of the word partner with the therapist assuming that the two mens estrangement is romantic in nature as they quarrel like an old married couple. Though 22 Jump Street goes out of its way to disavow overt homophobia--when a frat bro uses an anti-gay epithet similar to the one Hill himself recently had to apologize for throwing at a paparazzo hes summarily chewed out by our right-thinking heroes--several scenes got me thinking about the future of the straight male buddy comedy which has long depended on Friends-style ""hey were not gay"" jokes--the kind that poke fun at male heterosexual insecurity while also cordoning off same-sex love as an impossibility so remote as to be comical. As same-sex marriage becomes more common and anti-gay slurs (hopefully) more socially stigmatized what will become of this brand of lighthearted bromophobia? The superfluity of that therapy scene--and a few others centering around the same played-out joke--made me wonder if it may be time for the bromance to evolve or die. But Tatum and Hill have developed a comic chemistry that plays to both their strengths. Tatum in particular makes the most of his characters lunkheaded innocence and while Im not yet convinced of Jonah Hills range (with Moneyball being a welcome exception) hes firmly in his comfort zone as the hypersensitive and needy Schmidt. Other funny performances occur around the movies margins. Jillian Bell plays Mayas ever-present and ever-judgmental roommate who cant stop commenting in a nasal monotone on the McQuaid brothers evident post-collegiate age and probable status as narcs. And twins Keith and Kenny Lucas looking so alike I thought at first they were a split-screen effect play the cops chirpy half-black half-Asian suitemates who are so attuned to each other they not only finish each others sentences but conduct whole conversations in perfect unison--a simple gag that works only because of the Lucas precise comic timing. Phil Lord and Chris Miller--who in addition to 21 Jump Street have also made two triumphant animated films Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and The Lego Movie--stuff every scene with an excess of verbal and visual gags that pay homage to a wide range of comic influences. In one ingeniously staged car chase a football-helmet-shaped mini-vehicle pursues a full-size car past a campus building emblazoned with the words ""Benjamin Hill Film Studies Center"" as a Benny Hill-esque theme tootles in the background. The closing credits turn the joke-density dial even higher envisioning the posters and promotional campaigns for an endless succession of progressively numbered Jump Street sequels in which our heroes go undercover to solve crimes at a culinary school a ninja school a beauty school and eventually a retirement home.

Actually one could argue that that back-and-forth dynamic of masculine possibility defines the entire movie Were gay Were macho Were gay-macho But I digress. Anyway a skinhead villain comes upon them in the library stacks and reassures his drug-lord boss (Peter Stormare) that its no problem ""Boss its just a couple of faggots.""Tatums character the cheerful but dim undercover cop called Jenko explodes in anger ""What did you just call me?"" So is he going to beat the guys ass for questioning his sexuality? No. Hes going to educate him about hate speech. ""You cant say that You can say gay thats OK. Or maybe homosexual."" If you know the person well enough and they have a sense of humor he continues you might even get away with ""queer."" That scene - funny surprising and more than a little preposterous -- sums up the appeal and the limitations of this ultra-self-aware franchise which has taken the latent homoeroticism of every buddy-cop drama pulled it to the surface and allowed it to bloom into a thousand flowers.Here we are in the summer of 2014 pausing an action scene in a goofball Hollywood comedy to tell the audience not to call people ""faggots"" just as Jonah Hill recipient of the imaginary blow job has to go on TV and apologize for doing exactly that. Its either the high point of pop-culture sexual tolerance since the early career of David Bowie or its something else possibly a moment of widespread bewilderment and hypocrisy. Either way ""22 Jump Street"" is the good-natured sloppily rendered pile of balderdash for that moment a movie thats immune to all criticism and not worth bothering to dislike.If you enjoyed writing-directing tandem Phil Lord and Christopher Millers peculiar 2012 reboot of ""21 Jump Street"" which turned a forgotten and non-lamented 1980s TV series into an extended sketch comedy routine for Tatum and Hill then youll enjoy this sequel. (Theyre the same duo behind ""The Lego Movie"" the irresistible if exhausting animated hit.) Because its exactly the same movie with the gags feebly updated for a collegiate setting a new array of angry glares from Ice Cube several ridiculous chase scenes an obligatory drug freakout and a thoroughly unlikely romantic interest for Schmidt Hills character. Once again the duo are tasked to go undercover and sniff out a drug ring thats destroying the youth of America and once again the so-called plot is not even remotely the point.What is the point you ask? One might as well inquire what the point was of ""Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy"" although I dont kid myself that anyone in this movies target audience has seen that or will get the reference. Hill and Tatum make a classic and highly successful comedy team balancing a series of amiable running gags and the most familiar kind of slapstick. Jenko is the athletic and perfectly proportioned hunk whos none too swift; Schmidt is the cowardly out-of-shape couch potato whos way too confident. We are meant to understand of course that both actors are in on the joke We know or believe that Tatum is smart enough to know hes playing to stereotype and that Hill is by all accounts a great guy rather than a vain and supercilious jerk. Furthermore its not as if winking at the audience and acting slightly above the material is some new invention in comedy; I dont know whether Tatum and Hill have seen the Marx Brothers or Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis but Lord and Miller definitely have. You Might Also Like In fact theres nothing new in this paper-thin collegiate farce - we get scenes of frat life the football team boring and pervy professors slam poetry and spring break all of it distinctly third-rate - except perhaps for the homoerotic subtext-turned-text. Jenko and Schmidt are either too dense to notice that they relate to each other as lovers or they simply dont care and either way its supposed to be simultaneously a sign of progress and completely hilarious. Mind you Im not even sure Im offering a critique here It actually is funny when Jenko and Schmidt wind up holding hands and talking about their commitment issues in a psychologists office after he misunderstands their use of the word ""partner.""There isnt a smidgen of conscious or intentional homophobia in ""22 Jump Street"" which is certainly an improvement on the stream of angst-ridden gay-themed humor that runs through many Apatow-style comedies. (The infamous debate between Jason Bateman and Jason Sudeikis in ""Horrible Bosses"" on the subject of which of them is more likely to be raped in prison is a classic example but hardly an isolated one.) I was going to say that theres still a slight undercurrent of the idea that homosexuality is inherently funny in this movie but even that is not entirely fair. Hill has a hilarious erotic near miss with ""Eastbound amp; Down"" co-star Jillian Bell (who nearly steals the entire movie in a thoroughly hostile supporting role) that supports the thesis that heterosexuality is pretty funny too. It would also be pretty stupid to observe that ""22 Jump Street"" is not a serious enough movie to offer any real perspective on contemporary sexual mores. First of all thats obvious The point of the film lies in Tatums elaborate drawn-out double takes or the way that Hill can nurse self-pity and a misguided sense of intellectual superiority right to the edge of being intolerable. (And also in watching Ice Cube destroy an entire luncheon buffet.) Or actually no The real point of ""22 Jump Street"" the meta-point arrives at the very end when scenes from the dozens of sequels Lord and Miller will presumably never make play over the closing credits the one in culinary school the one in ballet school the one in outer space and the one that involves mariachi costumes. Definitely stay for those They might be funnier than the movie that precedes them.Secondly its not even true that dopey Hollywood comedies dont offer a gauge of whats going on in society. They often do so more transparently and with less pretension than dutiful dramas about ""serious issues."" So heres where we are as a nation in the era of Michael Sam and Jason Collins The football stud may or may not be giving his chunky friend a blow job in the library - and the idea that such a thing could happen may or may not be funny in itself. (Later in the film the life-saving deus ex machina also involves Jenko making intimate contact with Schmidts crotch.) Theyre gay or theyre clueless or its all a big funny misunderstanding. We dont know how we feel about any of that but we feel sheepish about the bad things we used to say and we sort of kind of halfway promise not to do it anymore. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

(AP Photo/Sony Pictures Glen Wilson) Share PhotoThings are always worse the second time around the deputy police chief warns the buddy-cop team of Jenko and Schmidt in ""22 Jump Street.""Hes talking about their next assignment but of course its an inside joke -- with the audience. ""22 Jump Street"" starring the inspired comic duo of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is a sequel and movie sequels are indeed often worse (especially when as the chief also points out the budgets bigger the second time around.)Self-referential jokes aside things arent worse the second time around for Hill Tatum and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Its fine to make fun of sequels -- and this movie does all the way to a fabulous ending-credits bit that steals the film -- when you know youve made a pretty darned good one yourself.Not that this film is perfect -- some jokes go too far or too long or both and one running gag involving prison sex is gratuitous ill-advised unfunny and well wed say more but three adjectives are enough. Many more jokes though -- spoken and visual -- succeed beautifully.And the cast? Its a pretty heavenly group anchored of course by Hill and Tatum who have a Laurel-and-Hardy-like implausible chemistry that keeps you laughing pretty much no matter what theyre doing.If you never saw ""21 Jump Street"" no worries -- the filmmakers bring you up to speed fast. The last film saw Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) go undercover to high school. This time its college theyre ordered to infiltrate to thwart a nasty drug ring. (""Im the first person in my family to pretend to go to college"" Jenko says proudly.)Its part of the joke that the pasty pudgy Schmidt especially hardly looks college-age and doesnt really try despite his need to blend in. ""Tell us about the war -- ANY of them"" one student Mercedes (a terrific Jillian Bell) says to him mockingly. Even less plausible than Schmidt being an undergrad that the exquisitely gorgeous art major Maya Mercedes roommate (Amber Stevens) would somehow hook up with him when hes nothing but bumbling in her presence. But as they say in college whatever. Maybe shes blown away by his (terrible and very funny) attempt at slam poetry.The college setting provides its usual comic fodder starting with a cute montage involving things you need to live in college dorms Popup laundry hampers bean-bag chairs lava lamps shower poofs a bacon machine (dont ask.) Theres also the obligatory frat house which sets up the amusing BFF relationship between studly Jenko and studly frat leader Zook (Wyatt Russell who brings to mind a younger Owen Wilson.)Jenko bonds easily with Zook who lures him onto the football team where Jenko succeeds dramatically. The two bond so well that Jenko and Schmidt have a sort of buddy-cop breakup. ""Maybe we should you know investigate other people"" Jenko tells a wounded Schmidt.But the guys need to crack the drug case -- moneys running out according to their supervising captain Dickson played by Ice Cube in a humorous performance that seethes all kinds of rage -- professional personal you name it. And so tracking down the villains we eventually arrive in -- of course Mexico for spring break There watch for a weirdly hilarious fistfight between Schmidt and one of the characters weve mentioned earlier.Its one of the films best scenes but no scene in the film proper rivals the closing credits -- a sendup of sequels which includes its own notable celebrity cameo and is alone worth the price of admission.Will there be a ""23 Jump Street""? If things are always worse the second time wouldnt they be even worse the third? With Lord and Millers track record thats hardly a given.""22 Jump Street"" a Columbia Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some violence.""

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW 22 Jump Street Running time 107 minutes. Rated R (crude humor profanity sexual content drug material brief nudity). Opens 7 p.m. Thursday at the E-Walk the Union Square the Lincoln Square others. Whats the difference between ""21 Jump Street"" and ""22 Jump Street""? Same as the difference between getting a 21 and a 22 at blackjack. The sequel to one of the funniest films of the last five years is so repetitious so manic so forced and so convinced its clever to be lame as long as you keep telling the audience youre being lame and that its title seems like a bewildering typo. Surely the franchise wasnt due to run this short of ideas until about ""28"" or ""29 Jump Street""? After a senseless slapstick opening scene that seems like something cut out of a 1988 Sylvester Stallone cop flick Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) go undercover on a college campus for an imagination-free rehash of the first films plot to bust a drug ring. Schmidt for no discernible reason short of science fiction hooks up with the colleges hottest girl (Amber Stevens) while Jenko learns in class that its not cool to use homophobic slurs (you know of the kind Hill was caught using last week). Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill head to college in ""22 Jump Street.""Photo Columbia Pictures Except for occasional bright moments -- I liked Jillian Bell as Schmidts girlfriends crazy-eyed roommate who keeps making old-age jokes about him -- the movie keeps taking already-tired gags and beating them to death. In half a dozen different scenes Jenko vaults athletically up and down stairways and the exteriors of buildings while Schmidt keeps having to take the long way around. By the time the guys take turns in a frat-initiation ritual you can write the gags yourself. The first movies gibes at 80s cop buddy movies were dead-on but despite having the same directors (Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) ""22"" has little wit. Instead it just throws in senseless chases and shootouts -- in a particularly inept library scene the villains miss our boys with pistols from a distance of maybe 6 feet and then the detectives escape in a golf cart dressed up like a football helmet for no reason except it looks goofy. (Then out of nowhere a Benny Hill joke.) Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum go for a ride in the ""helmet-mobile"" in ""22 Jump Street.""Photo Columbia Pictures When the script isnt telling us how pathetic and meretricious sequels are (too true) its going overboard with retro gay-panic humor. One scene depends on Jenko being grossed out by pretending to be in a gay couple (and even eww holding hands with Schmidt) in a therapists office. Many other scenes have the same premise. Were going backwards here fellas. These characters were interesting in the first film. After the third or fourth exhausting brainless chase youd think the movie would be wrapping up but no -- theres still 25 crashingly dull minutes to go so a few million can be blown on a spring break trip (but its cool because the characters joke about the budget too). More dumb shootouts and fights ensue. To cap it one of the stupidest jokes in this (or any other) movie comes in at the very end Ordered by Schmidt to say something cool before lobbing a grenade Jenko shouts ""Something cool"" Lord and Miller are so convinced this ones a winner that they repeat it two or three more times. Being intentionally boring isnt the same as being interesting and being intentionally trite isnt the same thing as being original. Guys just because your characters keep saying theyre too old for this s - - t doesnt mean it isnt true.

(Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures) <<1>>Related StoriesJun 1122 Jump Street 5 summer comedies that shocked usRare is the comedy sequel that graduates with honors.A handful from the Hollywood factory have done so including ""Toy Story 2"" ""Addams Family Values"" and ""National Lampoons Christmas Vacation.""More often however studios return to a cash cow with no new ideas and then give us sour milk. The lazy ""Hangover"" sequels spring to mind.Given such failures youd think studio bigwigs would avoid the silly move of simply remaking the same movie and calling it a sequel. But the defiant ""22 Jump Street"" with its odd-couple pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum mostly does just that. And it pulls it off with hilarious irreverence that invites the audience to share in the circus act of winks nods and in-jokes.The second cinematic outing with the bromantically inclined Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) books the inept undercover cops on virtually the same mission -- impersonating students to collar a ringleader who is dealing killer drugs on campus. The only difference Theyre heading to college not high school and now have a bigger budget to play with given the unexpected success of their first operation (wink wink).As you can tell ""22 Jump Street"" lampoons its own existence and the jovial screenplay from Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman hits more than misses that target. In fact the randomly plotted film which seems highly improvised pokes fun at itself so often that it practically breaks all its ribs by the time its ingenious end credits roll and take the self-deprecation to even greater heights.Advertisement At times all of this joshing gets a little much with jokes about Schmidt and Jenko looking too old to be students becoming feeble and exhausted late in the game. Still ""22 Jump Street"" works and earns a spot on the summer-movie honor roll.The best laugh besides a man-woman fist fight near the finale come when Ice Cubes short-fused Captain Dickinson goes on a rant at a college lunch and his frenzied fury collapses you into near ""Bridesmaids"" hysterics. Overall though its the union of Hill and Tatum that makes the film such a smash.The mismatched cop partners genre is overrun with good and not so-good pairings. The Hill-Tatum partnership which looked terrible on paper is bromantic fantastic. The strapping Tatum has a real gift for comedy and his characters puppy-dog earnestness pingpongs off Hills everyman inferiority complex perfectly. In a reversal from the first film its Tatums rather dense Jenko who becomes instantly popular landing on the football team and triggering a new bromance with the teams quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell). That relationship drives a wedge between the cop buddies but Schmidt keeps busy romancing art student Maya (Amber Stevens) which fuels a fistful of insults from her roommate Mercedes (scene-grabber Jillian Bell). Co-directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""The Lego Movie"" and ""21 Jump Street"") have a spirited and light touch and give the secondary actors enough elbow room to move around. But they grasp that it is the chemistry between Hill and Tatum that makes this franchise based loosely on the late-1980s/early-90s TV series work. None of what goes down on-screen makes one lick of sense nor should it. ""22 Jump Street"" realizes its main goal is to be ridiculously fun and that to do so it must be utterly ridiculous as well as in on the joke. If only more sequels could be so cheeky and self-aware.22 Jump Street    Rating R (for language throughout sexual content drug material brief nudity and some violence)Cast Channing Tatum Jonah Hill Ice Cube Wyatt RussellDirectors Chris Miller and Phil LordRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

And thats part of the joke.(Photo Glen Wilson Sony Pictures) 101 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMOREThe guys in 22 Jump Street spend much of their time caught in a bad bromance.Which is not to imply that the sequel to 21 Jump Street is unsatisfying. In fact its often hilariously funny (   out of four; rated R; opening Thursday in some theaters and Friday nationwide). Their bond however goes sour for at least half the movie which takes them through nasty bickering couples counseling and an eventual rift. An undeniably zany re-boot the surprising freshness of its predecessor is lacking however as is often the way of sequels.The self-referential movie is exceedingly aware of its inherent lack of originality and that knowledge makes for some of the movies best jokes. If this all sounds strangely circular thats because this is the ultimate meta movie. The repetition is exactly the point.22 is a smart and appealing comedy powered by the winning chemistry of Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill and cleverly directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller the duo behind 21 Jump Street and The Lego Movie.STORY Hollywoods best sidekicks have your backMORE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesDeft physical comedians with spot-on timing Hill and Tatum reprise their odd-couple roles from the 2012 original. The inevitability of sequels after a box office success is essentially the joke here. While the plot is not as taut as the first movies the audiences familiarity with the concept will smooth over the rough spots. Basically its just fun to watch these guys spar bumble and endure what amounts to an awkward break-up.And as in most movie break-ups we know theyll reunite their commitment re-upped. In this way it mocks the conventions of romantic comedies as well as action films.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The 21 Jump Street team relocates to 22 Jump Street and goes back to school. This time its college. VPCIn a minimalist redundant plot undercover cops Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) again play brothers this time posing as college students to bust up another shady drug ring. Where the first film offered a clever commentary on PC high school values subverting expectations this one merely satirizes college cliches. Jenko bonds with football star/frat bigwig Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Schmidt connects with art student Maya (Amber Stevens).The car chases are unremarkable but the stunts -- which comically juxtapose Tatums athletic grace and Hills stocky clumsiness -- are a hoot. The focus is trained more tightly on the lead characters than in the first film which featured a broader ensemble. Here outside characters are merely foils for Jenko and Schmidt with the possible exception of a very funny Jillian Bell as a college student who continually and dryly mocks Schmidts middle-aged appearance. (In 21 it was Jenkos mature look that served as the recurring joke.)The through line is the inherently lame nature of sequels. That notion comes to a raucous climax as the credits roll featuring a mocking litany of future installments. The franchise possibilities are seemingly endless put forth in fast and furious fashion. The montage includes 23 Jump Street Medical School through Culinary School Traffic School Beauty School and on to Jump 4 Ever The Animated TV series and finally Jump Street Retirement Home. It makes for the funniest closing credit sequence since 2008s Tropic Thunder.The homoerotic aspects of their partnership are mined to greater comic effect this time around. And really who of any persuasion could resist the endearing puppy-dog quality of Tatums Jenko?Even more than absurdist genre parody 22 Jump Street is all about clownish male bonding and Hill and Tatums pairing is as ludicrously inspired as they come. So bring on the parade of sequels. 101 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1hJvrKQ",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/11/22-jump-street-review/9649089/,200,22jumpstreet41,22jumpstreet,usatoday

Since the first film was such a fast and fizzy buddy-cop bromance thats not the worst news in the world. But it is a bit of a disappointment. Reprising their Mutt-and-Jeff routine Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play undercover narcs Schmidt and Jenko who are assigned to go back to school and pose as students to sniff out a drug ring. Sound familiar? Only this time instead of high school theyre dumped on a college campus and the drug is a deadly synthetic mix of Ecstasy and Adderall called WHYPHY. ""Do the same thing as last time and everyone will be happy"" their pencil-pushing supervisor (Nick Offerman) tells the fellas at the outset. And thats precisely what they do beat for beat for the next two hours. To cover up the scripts lack of originality screenwriters Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman pummel us with a string of self-aware meta-commentary jokes that poke fun at bloated sequels. Its as if theyre trying to beat viewers to the realization that were being peddled sloppy seconds. But just because the writers repeatedly elbow the audience in the ribs about how cynical sequels are doesnt make their approach any less cynical. Its a good thing then that Hill and Tatum continue to have such great chemistry. Hills neurotic-motormouth act and Tatums lovable-lunkhead shtick still shoot giddy sparks. After kicking off with a ridiculously over-the-top action-flick sequence the guys show up at their swanky new HQ in an old Vietnamese church across the street from their previous digs (hence the new address in the title). Their barking captain played with hard-ass menace by Ice Cube informs them that hes enrolling them at MC State where theyll pretend to be the most genetically mismatched siblings since Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in Twins. Adding some supporting-cast spice are comedians Kenny and Keith Lucas as a pair of narcoleptically chill identical twins who live across the hall and Jillian Bell as a sarcastic grump who spews acid insults about how old Schmidt and Jenko look. One of the unexpected treats of the first film was the positioning of the Abercrombie-sculpted Tatum as the unpopular loser and the brainy sack of mashed potatoes Hill as the BMOC. Here the roles are reversed Tatum bros down with some football-stud frat boys while Hill is shunned and forced to hang with an emo crowd that includes a beautiful coed (Amber Stevens) he meets when he does a bonkers poetry-slam number that earns him the (untimely) nickname Maya Angelou (see sidebar). The spoken-word bit culminates in one of the films best moments a walk-of-shame gag in which Hill exchanges embarrassed glances with female classmates making the morning-after walk across the quad. The movie couldve used more cracked scenes like that one. Instead 22 Jump Street lazily milks the undercover brothers codependency for gay-panic punchlines (enough already). They bicker. They break up. They go their separate ways. (Cue John Waites ""Missing You."") Tatum then finds a new target for his homoerotic double entendres in the alpha-male quarterback Zook played by Wyatt (son of Kurt) Russell. As the tired investigation spins its wheels to a spring-break climax in Mexico the movie nearly morphs into a slack installment in the Bad Boys franchise complete with shootouts chases and even a fiery helicopter explosion. On the plus side it also gives us more of Bells delirious deadpan misanthropy. I dont want to give the impression that I didnt laugh at times. I did -- especially during the films inspired end-credits tease of future Jump Street installments. But Ive come to expect more from directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who have been on a roll with the cult TV series Clone High the first Jump Street and most recently The LEGO Movie. The merry-prankster duo have a real knack for cheeky pop culture mischief and placing clever new spins on shopworn properties. I get that with sequels moviegoers are to some extent asking to see more of the same. But does the same have to feel quite so samey?

So were reminded repeatedly by nearly every cast member in ""22 Jump Street"" the sequel to ""21 Jump Street"" itself a reworking of a musty ol IP that surprised everyone with its sharp wit and spiffy performances. This second chapter wastes no time in hoisting its banner this will be the most ""meta"" movie ever made short of the work of Zucker-Abrams-Zucker or Mel Brooks. ""Oh thats so needlessly expensive"" is a frequent comment a jape at the studios decision to throw money at a known property rather than to invest in a new idea. Yes this movie has a story but it is such a blatant retread of the first one that the film will practically mock you if you pay too much attention to the plot. But thats whats up top. The real story - and it is shocking how well it works - is seeing the bromance between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum get tested as the pair bring their undercover routine from high school to college. They go through the motions of a police investigation but ""22 Jump Street"" is really about exploring male friendship. Well that and jokes. There are plenty of jokes. From remarking that their captains new digs look like ""a cube of ice"" (he is played by Ice Cube) to cars zipping in an under-cranked chase in front of the ""Benjamin Hill Film Studies Building"" this movie is a zing-a-minute bombardment from Hill Tatum and a slew of supporting players. New faces of note include Jillian Bell as a deadpan schoolmate who is relentless in her verbal abuse (a recurring gag - Hill and Tatum really really dont look 19 years old) and the Lucas Brothers a pair of perma-stoned twins who finish one anothers sentences. These new characters plus the continual reminder not to spend any energy whatsoever on trying to decipher the plot make for an extremely breezy agreeable moviegoing experience. This deftness however does make for something of a light experience. Also there is a surprising lack of visual pop to the movie - which is a letdown considering directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord (""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs"" ""The LEGO Movie"") have such a visual flair. Indeed their gift for high fructose montage only comes into play during the films soon-to-be-world-famous end credits sequence - which is essentially the worlds most awesome YouTube supercut. (Im not spoiling the specifics in this review - youll find out soon enough.) Still ""22 Jump Street"" is a success as there is a little good ol fashioned ""heart"" beneath its post-modern veneer. While heavy on the homo-eroticism yuks Hill and Tatums BFF routine as described through a yin-yang motif is disarmingly sweet. When one has to root around the others scrotal area for a stashed grenade and it becomes a giggle-tickle fest (whilst hanging from a helicopter) one cant help but feel a sense of giddy joy. This is the least essential of Miller amp; Lords work (and yes their antic high/low humor is in a class by itself right now) but it is certainly worth catching.

Sometimes you need a little flapdoodle and the fun of watching Tatum and Hill ribbing each other for 90-odd minutes was more than enough to make up for the movies bumpy bagful-of-gags shape. As undercover cops who pose as teenagers to root out drug dealers at the local high school Tatum and Hill made an unlikely but weirdly charming team Tatums Jenko was the sleepy-eyed jock with no qualms about slipping back into high-school society clearly happy to re-create the best years of his life. Hills Schmidt was the awkward but bright loser whod probably had more than a lifetimes worth of being slammed into lockers. Their Mutt-and-Jeff bickering eventually mellowed into a friendship as comfy as a rumpled T-shirt and watching them jab elbows along the way was a ridiculous delight. They wore the scars of their bruiser bromance like late-night drunken tattoos. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Now theres a sequel named with brilliant illogic 22 Jump Street but the magic has dimmed a bit. This time Jenko and Schmidt have been assigned to a local college -- their boss once again is played by a splendidly surly Ice Cube -- where its their duty to find and arrest the dealer whos spreading a powerful drug around campus. Its called WHYPHY (pronounced ""Wi-Fi"" in case you couldnt guess) and its a miracle substance that makes you really focused for an hour or so and then totally messes up your head in the good way. Unfortunately the person responsible just may be Jenkos new best friend a puka-shell-wearing football player and frat guy named Zook (Wyatt Russell son of Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and bearing the comic-timing DNA of both).Schmidts feelings are deeply hurt by Jenkos preoccupation with his new buddy though he tries not to show it. He keeps himself busy by scrambling onstage at a poetry slam (sample lyric ""Jesus cried. Runaway bride"") in order to impress a possible love interest (played by Amber Stevens an actress with Nefertiti eyes). Meanwhile Jenko and Zook get along like fraternity brothers They spot each other during grunt-heavy weight-lifting sessions and Zook is duly impressed by Jenkos ability to remove beer-bottle caps with his eye sockets. Jenko and Schmidt drift apart; the movie makes numerous homoerotic references to this fading friendship but only in a ""Totally yankin your chain bro"" way.Film Details 22 Jump Street RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time112 More Info Trailer Its there that 22 Jump Street wobbles off the rails. The directing team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the masterminds of not just 21 Jump Street but also The Lego Movie and the much-loved Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) along with writers Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman pack the movie with lots of loosey-goosey dynamite jokes that revel in their own puerility accompanied by a knowing wink. But Lord and Miller go overboard on the nudge-nudge gay jokes as when Jenko and Schmidt find themselves in a counseling session with a shrink who assumes theyre a couple. ""I feel like hes just not trying anymore"" Schmidt wails. Jenko retorts that he could just use a little more space. Its not that this gag or any of the others in 22 Jump Street is blatantly homophobic. (And Hills recent real-life outburst in which he flung an unacceptable word at a paparazzo who was harassing him shouldnt be held against the movie. Even in a world rife with teary celebrity retractions Hills subsequent Tonight Show apology suggested genuine regret.) It may just be that Lord and Miller are misfiring in their attempts to explore the complexities of friendships between men. But whatever theyre trying to say remains indistinct and noncommittal even as they seem a little too obsessed with it; the recurring ""gay not-gay"" jokes are neither particularly funny nor insightful and they push the movie slightly out of whack.But then suddenly theres Tatums Jenko trying to cut a pane of glass with a laser pointer and its easy to forgive. 22 Jump Street isnt uncharitable or mean-spirited; at worst its just confused. Tatum is predictably adorable. His Jenko is a pumped-up naif bumbling through life with a crooked smile and Hill again makes a great sparring partner. Hill knows how to milk Schmidts hurt feelings for laughs instead of fake pathos -- its a testament to his gifts that he doesnt overplay the sad-sack routine.But the biggest surprise of 22 Jump Street is another duo the identical-twin comedy team the Lucas Brothers (stars of the marvelous Comedy Central bonbon The Super Late Morning Show as well as the creators of the Fox animated series Lucas Bros. Moving Co.). As Jenko and Schmidts super-laid-back dorm neighbors Keith and Kenny Yang -- their African-American-Chinese heritage is part of the joke -- they not only finish each others sentences but also reel off complete thoughts simultaneously in perfect synchronicity. Whats wonderful is the surprised delight they show every time this happens which is often They turn to each other facing off in their identical horn-rimmed glasses and upturned caps and bask in the zany wonder of their from-the-womb mind-meld. The Lucas Brothers whose names really are Kenny and Keith dont get much screen time in 22 Jump Street but the movie takes a leap whenever they show up. Theyre its biggest WHYPHY high.1 Glen Wilson/Columbia Pictures Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Some friendships dont survive college. That tiny but unavoidable tragedy lends ""22 Jump Street"" just the right twinge of longing this otherwise lightweight buddy bromance needs. After surviving the police academy and a second stint in high school (in ""21 Jump Street"") still-rookie cops Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) mismatched as a fuzzy slipper and a well-worn gym sock head to the university dorms to find another drug dealer distributing a new pill around campus. ""Do the same thing as last time [then] everyones happy"" theyre told. See video 22 Jump Street Trailer Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill Are Going Back to School (Video) Fresh off Februarys ""The Lego Movie"" the directing and franchise-(re)inventing team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who also directed ""21"" deliver yet another boundlessly clever and playful comedy. A few of the self-referential gags get recycled one too many times but an exuberant buoyancy -- and the belly-laugh-a-minute pacing of the jokes -- makes ""22 Jump Street"" a hilarious highpoint of an already quite funny summer season. After a Marvel-esque opening that recaps ""21"" -- and its definitely worthwhile to rewatch the marvelous original before heading to the multiplex since the sequel refers to its events early and often -- ""22"" sends Schmidt and Jenko off to the local state school to stamp out a popular new drug called ""WHYPHY."" Lord and Miller find the perfect balance between giving us more of what made ""21"" such a success and providing enough new material so that ""22"" doesnt feel like a complete retread. Among the latter is a reversal of fortunes for the buddy cops; this time its Jenko who finds his groove on campus (among some inoffensive lunkheads) while Schmidt discovers his emo side when abandoned first by his partner then by the effortlessly cool girl (Amber Stevens) whos not so sure about him in the cold light of day. ""22"" also offers pitch-perfect satires of campus staples like the creepily earnest professor the walk of shame the lack of privacy between roommates and slam poetry. Lord and Millers precise observations are matched by flawless casting (with help from casting directors Nicole Abellera and Jeanne McCarthy). The prominent inclusions of Jillian Bell as a hysterically nasty and later awkwardly sexual mean girl and identical twins Kenny and Keith Lucas as a goofy stoner duo make this project feel like an incubator for future comedy stars. But ""22"" belongs indubitably to Tatum who plays off Hills neurotic mole like a cross between an acrobatic superhero and a happy monkey. The crowd-pleasing actor has never been better and this hulked-out version of Jenko exploits all of Tatums considerable strengths as a performer his physical grace his ready humility and joy his impressive pelvic thrusts and his particular brand of stupid genius. See photo Channing Tatum Opens Up About Alcoholism; Jonah Hill Kissing His Junk for GQ (Photo) Michael Bacall Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothmans spry witty script give Tatum one sidesplitting malaproprism after another. When Schmidt calls Jenkos Lamborghini poster ""a touch childish"" the meathead replies that he doesnt know what Lambos have to do with ""touching children."" Later when their investigation is on the verge of being shut down due to lack of progress Jenko tells their cross boss (Ice Cube) ""I thought we had Cate Blanchett with the budget."" He meant ""carte blanche."" Though drugs are very bad and blah blah blah ""22 Jump Street"" is less about the investigation than the complicated cocktail of guilt co-dependency and shared history that makes Schmidt and Jenkos friendship both volatile and effervescent. Its Jenko who pulls away first. He falls into a dopey but sweet platonic courtship complete with sandwich-based ""meet cute"" with a fratty football player (Wyatt Russell) who quickly becomes the jealous Schmidts prime suspect in the case. In the end though Lord and Millers efforts to go bigger backfire on them. The special effects budget is duly wasted on some vast but empty explosions and the running time is padded by too many repetitions of the same joke. Meta-commentary about how terrible sequels always are and about how Schmidt and Jenkos partnership resembles a gay relationship pad the running time with bloat as does a seemingly obligatory half-hour epilogue that squeezes in a few more car chases. Also read Jonah Hill Channing Tatum Fire Golden Guns on 22 Jump Street Poster But I hardly minded because the fact of the matter is that I laughed aloud for two hours straight and ""22 Jump Street"" has cemented the Lord and Miller Experience which is to chortle and guffaw while being distinctly impressed by their ingenuity and wit both visual and verbal. If ""22"" isnt as trim and tight as its predecessor its certainly smarter and more heartfelt. Whether this sequel is better than the original is up for debate but the franchise has definitely grown up. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

TWITTER Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill go back undercover this time in college. Dont dare accuse Phil Lord and Christopher Millers 22 Jump Street of being a paint-by-numbers sequel a piece of Hollywood hackwork that aims to be exactly like the first only bigger and more expensive -- the men and their screenwriters will make that case for you and when they do it youll laugh. ""Nobody gave a shit about the Jump Street reboot"" says Ice Cubes hardass Captain Dickson -- the first of many times when a character speaks of the fictional crime-fighting operation in ways that clearly refer to the movie itself -- but having succeeded Dickson says it will continue. He goes on ""Weve doubled the budget as if that would double the profit."" True to its promise this one practically Xeroxes the first films plot having bumbling cops Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum pose as students to bust a campus drug ring whose dangerous new pharmaceutical just claimed its first life. This time Tatums Jenko is the one who bonds with the cool kids hes supposed to be investigating abandoning his unhip partner Schmidt (Hill) -- the betrayal is even captured on surveillance equipment as it was last time. Fortunately 22 is just like 21 in at least one more way Its laugh-packed self-aware in a manner that lets everyone in on the joke and goofily satisfying in the action department. Though doubling the profit of the 202-million grossing original is as silly a goal as Capt. Dickson suggests this outing should have no trouble connecting at the box office. STORY Brad Pitt Says of Red-Carpet Prankster Vitalii Sediuk Hes Going to Get Stomped The partners enter the film in the kind of blockbuster-grade chase 21 couldnt have attempted Having caught a crime lord called Ghost (Peter Stormare) with an 18-wheeler full of illegal exotic animals they wind up riding atop it as it careens down the highway dangling from its sides and menacing its drivers Terminator-style until ... they flop. Soon Dickson and the police brass (Nick Offerman) decide the men should stick with what theyve already succeeded at. Do it just like last time Offerman insists in his patented voice of authority. Happily (since the men arent getting any younger) this new drug craze is surging at a college instead of at a high school. And at a fraternity-friendly campus Jenko is finally on territory he understands He finds his soulmate in Zook (Wyatt Russell) a quarterback who gets Jenko on the football team and in with the Zetas. Dimwitted Jenko who never got past high school (""Im the first person in my family to pretend to go to college"" he tells Schmidt proudly) is finally getting to live the touchdowns-and-raging-keggers dream. One of the most winning things about 21 Jump Street was watching Tatum whose genes should make him king of any known high school work through mystification anger and sadness when confronted with teens who didnt value his brand of dumb-macho cool. Making Schmidt the outcast this time is less successful The plump clumsy socially awkward dude is the one whos supposed to be unhappy right? So the screenwriters dive deep into bromance focusing on awkward encounters in which Jenko tries to expand his world without hurting Schmidts feelings. ""Maybe we should just investigate other people"" he says. Soon the ""open investigation"" becomes an explicit breakup and an Annie Hall gag dropped slyly into the opening scenes bears unexpected fruit. REVIEW Maleficent Its not all bad news for Schmidt who starts a sexually gratifying but potentially disastrous relationship with a lovely art student named Maya (Amber Stevens). That womans perpetually grumpy roommate (Jillian Bell) gets more mileage than anyone out of the films many jokes about the stars age but Maya seems blind to Schmidts schlubbiness. The most reliable humor here comes from the films 30 Rock-like way of drawing attention to the showbiz cliches its indulging in but Ice Cube wasnt joking about the production value In addition to meta gags we do get big stunty chases and the like especially when the action moves south for spring break. The finale is totally ridiculous but fun finally allowing these two mismatched buddies to form one perfect unit of cop-flick cool.

Instead of a cheapo cash-in here was a charming smartly self-mocking romp fronted by the most likeable and unlikely comedy double act in recent memory - Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. This follow-up scores cynical laughs from the idea that it could never match up to the gleeful surprise factor of the original. And it doesnt - but thats kind of okay. I want you to do exactly what you did last time barks the Chief of Police to undercover goons Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) - and its a maxim the movie takes to heart. So the boys head off to college to bust yet another shady drugs ring meet some more surprisingly available ladies get into a few more shoot-em-up car chases and crack many more obvious but amusing gags about the blurred lines between male bonding and homoeroticism. There are moments where this all feels a bit tired. The plot is less than tight the action scenes dont pop like they did the first time and the relationship between schlubby Schmidt and stunning Maya (Amber Stevens) feels like geek wish-fulfilment. But 22 Jump Street knows how to play to its strengths Tatums performance here is even more puppy-dog lovable than last time and his scenes with Hill possess a goofy low-key warmth too often lacking in big-budget comedy. Add to that a smattering of top-notch slapstick - one early gag borders on Buster Keaton-ish genius - and perhaps the funniest closing credits sequence ever and theres enough goodwill left over to balance out the clunky bits.

Need we say more? Those masters of having their genre-parody cake and eating it too directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have followed up their sly self-referential franchise reboot ""21 Jump Street"" with an inevitable sequel that is at least in part a sly self-referencing commentary on the inevitability of sequels. Reuniting producer-stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum for a second round of poorly camouflaged undercover antics ""22 Jump Street"" swaps high school for college and prom for spring break but otherwise sticks snugly to the prior films winning formula mining the resultant doublings and repetitions for maximum absurdist hilarity. (Think Samuel Becketts ""Animal House."") Given both Hill and Tatums ever-increasing zeitgeist value the pic should have little trouble besting its predecessors 200 million worldwide haul giving ""Lego Movie"" helmers Lord and Miller their second B.O. smash of 2014. Much as ""21 Jump Street"" managed to simultaneously tip its hat and thumb its nose at its 1980s fourth-network source material so ""22 Jump Street"" wears its sequel-ness on its sleeve from an opening ""previously on"" recap (including a wry ""Annie Hall"" homage not seen in the original film) to its inspired closing montage of concepts for future ""Jump Street"" sequels (culinary school ninja school). In between returning screenwriter Michael Bacall and co-writers Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman pick up exactly where ""21"" left off with officers Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) heading off to college on a new assignment for their beleaguered deputy chief (Nick Offerman) who winkingly cautions that things ""are always worse the second time."" As it happens its an online university to which the partners have been dispatched charged with ferreting out coded messages in the classroom lectures of a bloviating philosophy professor. But after letting a wanted kingpin (Peter Stormare) slip through their hands -- a hilarious episode that builds to a great Harold Lloyd-worthy bit of death-defying slapstick -- Jenko and Schmidt find themselves back on Jump Street back under the thumb of the dyspeptic Capt. Dickson (Ice Cube) and once again donning their alter egos of brothers Brad and Doug McQuaid to infiltrate a suspected drug-trafficking ring at a local university. Whereas high school redux proved an unexpected season in hell for Jenko (whose macho bullying ways were hopelessly out of step with the PC times) and a boon for the nerdy Schmidt (who suddenly found himself in with the ""in"" crowd) college life turns out to be very much the inverse. Proud to be the first person in his family ""to pretend to go to college"" Jenko quickly emerges as a prime catch for the MC State football team as well as for an elite fraternity house whose alpha-male president Zook (Wyatt Russell) may just be the dealer Dickson is trying to bust. But Jenko isnt nearly so sure and as he and Zook become fast BFFs Schmidt finds himself all out of love and hopelessly lost without his erstwhile wingman -- until that is he falls for beautiful art major Maya (Amber Stevens) who for reasons not immediately apparent should come labeled ""Look But Dont Touch."" The college scenes are like a lot of what Lord and Miller do hit-and-miss with a loosely stitched-together improv-comedy feel (in keeping with its self-reflexive spirit the film even includes an onscreen conversation about the relative merits of scripted and unscripted comedy). But ""22 Jump Street"" hits far more often than it misses and even when it misses by a mile the effort is so delightfully zany that its hard not to give Lord and Miller an ""A"" for effort. Almost worth the price of admission alone Schmidts impromptu participation in a slam poetry contest a cheerfully Dada piece of performance art that can stand shoulder to shoulder with Ron Burgundys jazz-flute solo from the first ""Anchorman"" movie. The writers have also fleshed out the sequel with a smattering of new characters that give several bright young comic performers a chance to shine especially twin brothers Keith and Kenny Lucas as a set of half-black half-Chinese twins who suggest stoner-doofus versions of the jive-talking passengers from ""Airplane"" and ""Workaholics"" alum Jillian Bell who brings a demented kewpie-doll intensity to the role of Mayas unstable roommate. A movie this self-aware might easily drown in its own ironic detachment but as they did so deftly in both ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movie"" Lord and Miller balance their smartypants meta-humor with go-for-broke pratfalls and a certain fundamental sincerity that keeps the characters relatable without ever veering into straight-faced emotionalism. (When it seems that the movie might along comes a good old-fashioned crotch-grabbing gag to lighten the air.) Perhaps owing to their background in animation (where they did ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"") Lord and Miller also know how to sell a joke visually better than most contemporary comedy directors and ""22 Jump Street"" is rife with delightful throwaway visual gags from De Palma-esque split screens to a car chase (between Hummer and helmet-shaped golf cart) that might have been designed by 60s-era Richard Lester. Eventually all roads lead to spring break in ""Puerto Mexico"" -- a conspicuously less decadent gathering than the one envisaged by Harmony Korine though it hardly matters because whenever Hill and Tatum are onscreen together the movie enters a blissful realm that nothing can violate. Both actors are marvelous physical comedians and much of ""22 Jump Street"" turns on Laurel-and Hardy-like juxtapositions of Hills short stocky inertia against Tatums chiseled gravity-defying grace. Tatum has been too good too many times now to still be deemed a revelation but he seems especially boisterous and joyful here like a mischievous first grader trapped in a linebackers body or perhaps a very deft comic actor who only belatedly came into a full sense of just how funny he can be. Whatever becomes of the ""Jump Street"" franchise from here let no man put this acting partnership asunder. A raft of unbilled special guest stars add to the generally merry vibe (be sure to stay all the way through the end credits). Consistent with the previous pic craft contributions are uniformly solid particularly d.p. Barry Petersons widescreen lensing which emulates the look of the very high-end action spectacles pic lovingly mocks. Film Review 22 Jump StreetReviewed at AMC Empire New York June 2 2014.
