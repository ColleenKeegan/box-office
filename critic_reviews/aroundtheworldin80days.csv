As Steve Coogans gung-ho eccentric inventor Fogg battles to oust the villainous head of the Royal Academy of Science (a mugging Jim Broadbent) by traversing the known world in an unheard-of time the screenplay gives equal import to happy-scrappy Chan posing as a half-French valet with the hidden agenda of saving his native Chinese village from an evil warlord. Euro starlet Cecile de France joins the team in Paris to add spurious PG-certificate romance interest and from then on the picture settles down into a rhythm of mild chop-socky star cameos ranging from pointless (Macy Gray??) to plain bizarre (yes the Governor of California as a frizzy-haired Turkish potentate) Heath Robinson-esque gadgetry giving Coogan a look-in and naff CGI interludes making out the route.True it doesnt pretend to be anything else except old-fashioned family entertainment but you keep waiting for anything resembling laughter or excitement. Director Coraci showed his leaden way with physical comedy in the Adam Sandler flick The Waterboy and the high-jinks land with a thud here too Chans characteristic energy levels notwithstanding. The materials far too broad for Coogans sly skills rendering his showing eager but bland the globe-trotting would-be spectacle unpersuasively setbound the overall appeal hard to fathom. Except perhaps to sadistic little boys who might relish trailing police inspector Ewen Bremners frequent painful slapstick humiliation.

And because the 1956 production still sets the bar for number of cameo appearances jammed into a supersized romp this amiably dorky redo directed by ""The Waterboy""s Frank Coraci doesnt try to match guest-star abundance but includes a drive-by hello from among others that shrewd high flyer Arnold Schwarzenegger in his last pre-gubernatorial acting gig. Whats new and nutty though is the physical comedy of Jackie Chan as Foggs manservant Passepartout a tailor-made tweak that results in a martial-arts subplot nestled with surprising charm in Vernes fantasy of futurism and eccentricity.

"80 Days Up Up -- and a Waste washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids 80 Days Up Up -- and a Waste Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 18 2004 MAYBE THIS will be a Trivial Pursuit question one day What movie featured Jackie Chan Steve Coogan and a certain Californian governor? The answer is ""Around the World in 80 Days"" an all-star remake of the David Niven film of the 1950s which is energetic if nothing else. And yes it is definitely nothing else. Theres no use lamenting for the ninth or 10th time Chans complete blandification into almost embarrassing childishness for Hollywood. As Lau Xing a Chinese villager caught up in a globe-traveling stunt you dont even need to guess at his persona. It has become the same picture in picture out. Once Asias most exciting stunt-performer hes now ""delightful"" ""goofy"" and ""never far from a smile."" This much can be lamented for the first time. Coogan one of Englands funniest comedians seems to have immediately sold himself to the lowest bidder. As Phileas Fogg an inventor who bets the imperious Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent) head of the Royal Academy of Science that he can traverse the globe in 80 days hes about as funny as wet bread. Lau has come to London to retrieve a jade Buddha stolen from his home village. He wrests it from the evil Gen. Fang (Karen Mok doing her best to keep the world well supplied in Asian cliches) and to avoid the London bobbies chasing him runs into Phileas. To cut some dreary exposition short Phileas mistakenly names him Passepartout and enlists him to accompany him on the world-traveling venture which includes trains and balloons. This is good for ""Passepartout"" who could use a ride home on that balloon. Joining up with wacky Frenchwoman Monique (Cecile De France whose only purpose in the movie is to attract French audiences when this movie is dumped on the European recycle market) and chased by Fangs Black Scorpions they try to make it back to London in time. During the journey they do indeed bump into Arnold Schwarzenegger who plays Prince Hapi a royal Turkish womanizer. Of course this lusty role is just going to play into some lingering rumors about Arnold. So let me be the first to say Arnold is definitely not Turkish. The gags are physical but rarely funny. This will ensure delight among the very young but precious few others I would wager. And Chan continues to strain himself to the point of bursting major blood vessels to be rubbery and obsequious. Theres nothing more to say except list a few cameos. If Chans in a movie you can almost be sure that Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson (playing the Wright brothers) aint far behind. And let us not fail to mention the highly significant role that Rob Schneider enjoys as a San Francisco homeless person who teaches the temporarily destitute Phileas how to make money on the street. And just to round off the list of cameos gone to mush theres John Cleese playing a London bobby just for a moment. Now for something completely different this aint.

"Around the World in 80 Days A Verrry Slow Boat to China washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Around the World in 80 Days A Verrry Slow Boat to China Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 16 2004 The new Disney film ""Around the World in 80 Days"" might generally be described as ""Around Epcot Center in 120 Minutes."" It has that cheesy chintzy mid-Florida feel that we all know and love despite its 110 million budget. How could they spend so much money and end up with something that looks so Orlando? Its sort of for a little while in the middle a Jackie Chan film and thats when its at its best. But its more often a Steve Coogan film. And who is Steve Coogan? Well he looks like the great Scots race car driver Jackie Stewart and he sounds like the great British actor Alan Rickman and thats all I know. Howd he get a major Disney film crafted around his small package of gifts? Hmmm. Beats the heck out of me. Possibly it has to do with the rumor that the movie was set up for Hugh Grant and Hugh couldnt make it so the production company had to scramble for a body. Wasnt Ben Affleck available? Any resemblance to the original ""Around the World"" a huge 1956 icon that arrived in the miracle of Todd-AO with David Niven in command is utterly coincidental. That movie if memory serves ventured into the real world. For the most part this one doesnt and the transparent phoniness of the sets -- it was shot mostly in a German studio -- is a continual annoyance. In fact I think that San Francisco London Paris Ankara and Delhi are on the same block of Berlin back lot with the signs and the crowds changed. Only when the film ventures to China (Thailand stars as China) does it pick up. The director Frank Coraci a former Adam Sandler intimate (""The Wedding Singer"") and writer David N. Titcher see Phileas Fogg -- the obscure Coogan -- not as a suave adventurer A  la Niven but as a somewhat more hackneyed character the wacky inventor. Thus much of the movie set in 1872 is taken up with fantastic inventions of the ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" sort which routinely chew spindle and mutilate their users for comic effect. In the first few minutes Chan is induced to ride what appears to be a steam-powered Tilt-a-Whirl in an attempt to break the 60-mile-per-hour barrier. In the last few minutes hes obliged to pedal a birdlike flying machine into downtown London to beat the deadline. You know what? Gizmos are overrated as movie amusements. Is there a soul on Earth over the age of 3 who still finds them funny? As the screenplay has it Fogg generally denounced as a fool by the posh bigwigs of the Royal Academy of Science makes a hasty bet with that outfits bigwig Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent in a performance broadly bent) that he can yes make it around the world in the titular time frame. It never occurs to the filmmakers that theres not really any connection between inventing and traveling so the whole premise feels like a non sequitur. Fogg has just hired a new valet Passepartout (as Jules Verne named him in the original novel) who is basically the facilitator of the trip. This is of course the great Chan one of the worlds most amusing movie clowns and jocks. The wrinkle is that hes a martial arts ace sent by his village to steal a stolen jade Buddha from the Bank of England where it has been deposited by a nefarious warlord. Having accomplished that Chan signs up with Fogg as the best way of getting back to China but doesnt tell the English fool about the detectives and warlord kung-fu experts on his trail. As did Mike Todd Coraci uses cameos to liven up the proceedings but to less positive effect The proceedings are deadened down significantly by unremarkable appearances by unremarkable people such as Kathy Bates Richard Branson (oh theres a howler) and Owen and Luke Wilson. But the worst of these deserves its own paragraph. Did Arnold Schwarzenegger actually become an actor? I thought so. But in this what is certainly his last appearance he is absolutely horrendous. Its not even a performance. He is so unhinged by the responsibility of playing a lecherous Ottoman despot in what looks to be a wig that Cher wore in the 70s and a gown designed by Givenchy in the 50s that he overacts with the hammy zeal of a pigs knuckle trying to disguise itself as a sauerbraten. Gott im himmel he ist awful It should not be permitted. Ja this is how it begins Perhaps hes having difficulty finding motivation. One cannot blame him. The script makes him delirious over the presence of person No. 3 on the trek and this is either Cecile De France as Monique La Roche or quite possibly Monique La Roche as Cecile De France I am not sure which. She is a tall more or less attractive (do you like that gaptoothed thing?) young woman of almost no apparent talent. She pretty much just stands there and squeaks. The film spurts briefly to life when it leaves back lot Berlin. A long sequence completes the story arc of the return of the jade Buddha and for just a few minutes the movie takes on the long-ago fairy-tale feel of classic 70s chopsocky. For once the annoying Europeans are shunted aside and Jackie Chan alone must defend his village against the warlords ninjas. He still knows how to choreograph a fight sequence and working one presumes with his core of tested stunt and martial arts professionals he throws together a nifty sequence of comic-toned hand-fist-foot-speed work. Its done lightly in an exaggerated diction bloodless comic acrobatic and ultimately it brings him nine masked allies including his old friend the great Sammo Hung Kam-Bo. Its a lovely few minutes of movie -- you can feel Chan pepping up growing in stature and engagement pulling the movie however briefly to a new level -- and it made me ache to see the dragon-fist school take on the swans-beak school for 70 delirious minutes in a Times Square grindhouse surrounded by sleeping bums. Man those were the days. Man these are not the days. That plot is forgotten and the movie falls from grace to clunkiness and continues its herky-jerky way-unfunny trek around the amusement park. Who needs it? Around the World in 80 Days (125 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for action violence and some crude humor.

Refitted as a starring vehicle for action icon Jackie Chan pic should do solid summer biz with Chan fans and general family audiences looking for old-fashioned entertainment. An unlikely property for a contemporary redo comes off in amiable fashion in ""Around the World in 80 Days."" Refitted as a starring vehicle for action icon Jackie Chan this second bigscreen version of Jules Vernes 1873 novel takes plenty of liberties with the material and never generates much genuine excitement but provides an agreeable ride without overloading it with contemporary filmmaking mannerisms. This isnt blockbuster stuff in the manner of the three-hour 1956 Academy Award winner but pic should do solid summer biz with Chan fans and general family audiences looking for old-fashioned entertainment. For all its fame as a big B.O. hit and personal triumph for producer Michael Todd the first version is a stodgy affair that proves a very tough sit today. Certainly one of the least deserving recipients of the best picture Oscar the original (just released on DVD) gets by to the extent that it does at all on the charm of leads David Niven and Cantinflas the scenic qualities and Victor Youngs score. So only viewers with the Foggiest of memories of that 48-year-old pic will mind the changes wrought by screenwriters David Titcher David Benullo and David Goldstein. They have turned Phileas Fogg (British comic Steve Coogan) into an inventor obsessed with creating the worlds first flying machine and Passepartout (Chan) into a Chinese adventurer pressed by circumstance into serving as Foggs valet. As set up here Fogg a wealthy and egocentric British gentleman in 1890 London is given a personal motive for accepting the bet that provokes his rushed circumnavigation of the globe Disrespected as a dilettante by the Royal Academy of Science Fogg will assume the organizations leadership held by the disdainful Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent) if he can get around the world and back to London in 80 days. If not hell be banned from inventing ever again. Passepartout aka Lau Xing has been sneaking around London avoiding the authorities after robbing the Bank of England of a much-sought-after jade Buddha that he merely wants to return to its proper home in his native Chinese village. Unbeknownst to all Lord Kelvin is desperate for the Buddha as well as hes in cahoots with the leader of a nasty band of Chinese assassins known as the Black Scorpions who turn up at the voyagers first destination Paris to attack Passepartout in a big street brawl. Stopping in at an exhibition featuring Vincent Van Gogh paintings attended by the artist himself the duo becomes a threesome when perky would-be painter Monique (Cecile de France) joins them for a simple reason ""I need a world journey to inspire me."" The purposeful Fogg spends much of the remaining trip trying to shed the capable young lady but he never quite manages to and of course ever so slowly opens his eyes to her charms. Director Frank Coraci heretofore known for his unsubtle comedic strokes with Adam Sandler on ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""The Waterboy"" works in a similarly broad vein here but in a genial way. Given the tendencies of modern comedy pic easily could have been vulgar and crass a CGI-fest loaded with anachronisms gross humor and a condescending attitude toward the quaint conventions of yesteryear. While this ""80 Days"" is hardly an impeccable compendium of late-Victorian-era manners and indulges contempo tastes in martial arts action and the occasional verbal usage (this is yet another period film in which characters exult ""Yes Yes Yes"" when things go their way) its liberties are taken in a breezy inoffensive manner that makes for easy acceptance and the tone is light rather than labored. So as the travelers make their way from Paris (seen off in a hot-air balloon by cameoing Richard Branson) to Munich and then to Istanbul where they are hosted by a horny Prince Hapi played enthusiastically in a frizzy black fright wig by none other than Governator Schwarzenegger the film settles in as a good-natured lark -- nothing special exactly but engaging enough and more colorful than most. After an interlude in India narrative settles in for its longest stay in China where Passepartout/Lau Xing receives a raucous welcome from relatives as he returns home with the jade Buddha. Biggest set piece consists of a diverting acrobatic battle between the marauding Black Scorpions and Chans 10-member ""Tigers"" clan but visit to the idyllic village ends with Fogg feeling betrayed by his friends deception heading off across the Pacific (by unshown means) alone. In San Francisco however Fogg needs rescuing by his pals who turn up at an opportune moment to whisk their leader off to complete the journey. Out West they encounter two vagabond bicycle entrepreneurs Orville and Wilbur Wright (Luke and Owen Wilson) who provide Fogg with some crucial inspiration. But in New York where the boat that will barely get them to London in time is about to leave theres a final showdown with the Scorpions leader General Fang (Karen Joy Morris in dragon-lady mode) in a warehouse amusingly filled with bits and pieces of the Statue of Liberty. Fanciful climax sees Fogg fulfilling his dream of flight while retaining Vernes original twist that decides the outcome of the bet. Chan does his patented comedic action thing with flair and good humor. Theres perhaps less spectacular risk-taking than before and the martial arts are of the more grounded variety but the star has extra fun with the multiple levels of ethnic baggage his character is carting around the world. Coogan long a TV favorite in the U.K. but known in the U.S. only to specialized auds for ""24 Hour Party People"" is a fine choice for Fogg Tall and imposing-looking from a distance thesp has qualities that invest the character with daft impertinent and impulsive streaks all of which give Fogg added edge and color. De France known to arthouse viewers for ""Lauberge Espagnole"" comes off winningly while Broadbent and Ewen Bremner the latter as a hapless inspector sent by Lord Kelvin to disrupt Foggs trip play to the rafters. Aside from Schwarzeneggers lively turn which is highlighted by a group Jacuzzi scene and was filmed before his election as governor of California other cameo of note comes from Kathy Bates as a conspicuously vivacious Queen Victoria. Despite its many settings production was lensed principally in Berlin with about a month in Thailand and second-unit work covering location identification shots elsewhere. Production values are handsome without being spectacular and Trevor Jones score keeps things moving without becoming bombastic.

(Related video See the movie trailer) Thats gotta hurt Jackie Chan lays into some unfortunate soul in the remake of Around the World in 80 Days. Buena Vista Pictures Todds onetime international phenomenon just out in one of the years most tantalizing DVD packages is often drubbed as being borderline clunky lacking directorial personality and one of the weaker movies to have won the best-picture Oscar. Fair enough but it also has charm and conceptual originality missing from this tepid global go-round. In a more apt comparison this version badly pales next to Chans Shanghai adventure-romps as well. Deviating even more from Verne than Todd did (would you believe there was no air balloon in the book?) this two-hour five-minute slog has Chans Passepartout hiring on as manservant/sidekick to co-star Steve Coogans Phileas Fogg. Passepartout has just robbed the Bank of England of a jade Buddha purloined from his Chinese homeland. The trip is motivated by a wager in this version too. And so much time is spent in China when the journey finally gets there that the rest of the movie feels rushed (though thats a gift). The San Francisco-New York hop is more like a jet from Minneapolis to St. Paul. Along the way in a movie with its own cameos the two meet Orville and Wilbur Wright (Luke Wilson with brother Owen whose familiar stoned cadences briefly engender a grain of zest). And before that a ridiculously coiffed Arnold Schwarzenegger shows up as Prince Hapi sharing his 19th-century hot tub with Chan. Arnie has never looked goofier but the sight depresses more than it amuses. As guvs go its hard to imagine Nelson Rockefeller or Averell Harriman slumming here when I was a kid. Cecile De France (LAuberge Espagnole) is an acceptably gap-toothed sweetie as the impressionist painter who accompanies the duo but Coogans renowned dialect skills cant make the movie any more interesting than Todds would have been had star David Niven not gotten so much support from the cameo appearances. Just going through the motions here (and mild ones at that) both Chan and the movie should have stayed at home. Savvier ticket buyers will do the same. (Opens today nationwide.

By my decidedly unscientific calculations -- and not including TV versions -- its happened just four times 1931s ""Cimarron"" (remade in 1961); 1935s ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" (1962 and 1984); 1948s ""Hamlet"" (numerous); and now 1956s ""Around the World in 80 Days"" which has been transformed into a Jackie Chan/Walt Disney family picture. In some ways its not a bad choice. The original Oscar winner is something of a bore more travelogue than drama so a remake could enliven the story. On the other hand the idea of a rich Englishman with a minority servant is a bit problematic today. The new ""80 Days"" handles any embarrassment this might cause by making Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan) less stiff-lipped time-keeping Brit than hapless inventor in need of a hug while his valet Passepartout (Jackie Chan) is well Jackie Chan the star of the picture who plays a man with his own agenda. Both films begin with bank robberies but this time the culprit is actually Passepartout who steals a jade Buddha that was originally stolen from his village in China. He takes the valet job as a cover and suggests the trip around the world -- which comes off not as a gentlemans wager but as a schoolyard taunting between Fogg and the evil Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent) -- in order to make it back to China. The 1956 version had numerous star cameos (Marlene Dietrich Frank Sinatra) and the new film continues this tradition Luke and Owen Wilson as Orville and Wilbur Wright; Sammo Hung as Chinese legend Wong Fei Hung. But the oddest cameo has to belong to gubenator Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Turkish prince who sporting a frizzy dark Prince Valiant wig attempts to make off with Foggs love interest Monique La Roche (Cecil de France). The 80 days go by fast light and sloppy. Director Frank Coraci (""The Wedding Singer"") crams it all in and drives the film forward but loses the sense -- which the original had -- of what a big place the world used to be. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Around the World in 80 Days"" with Jackie Chan Steve Coogan Jim Broadbent Cecil de France. Directed by Frank Coraci from a screenplay by David Titcher David Benullo and David Goldstein based on the novel by Jules Verne. 125 minutes. Rated PG for action violence some crude humor and mild language. Several theaters. The kids wont mind though -- its properly silly and slapsticky -- while there are belly-laughs for the adults. Coogan a star in Britain and rising here is hilarious as Fogg. Unfortunately de France is miscast. Her edges are just too sharp for such a soft comedy. As for Jackie Chan? At 50 bless him he can still move like a slippery bar of soap. Theres a great fight scene in his village in which he picks up a small wooden bench to defend himself. For those who know his early films this is like Fred Astaire picking up a top hat and cane. You know the guy with the sword has no chance.

Globe-trotting adventure goes extra mile for laughs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Around the World in 80 Days Comedy adventure. Starring Jackie Chan Steve Coogan and Cecile de France. Directed by Frank Coraci. PG. 105 minutes. At Bay Areatheaters.) ""Around the World in 80 Days"" is a delightful surprise. What could have been a slapdash remake is a complete re-imagining of the story that uses the Jules Verne novel and the 1956 Academy Award-winning film of the same name as a jumping-off point for an energetic and enormously good-natured family movie. It sounds like 1940s advertising copy to say it but this picture has a little of everything -- action romance adventure comedy -- all held together by a warm spirit and a smart directors commitment to keep things moving. If dissected the movie can be looked at as a mix of Verne and boilerplate Jackie Chan but each element invigorates the other. Once again as in ""The Medallion"" and ""Shanghai Knights"" Chan must retrieve and return an ancient artifact to its rightful location. Hes Lau Xing -- going under the name Passepartout -- who joins up with Professor Phileas Fogg as a way of gaining passage back to his rural Chinese village. British comedian Steve Coogan who plays Fogg is an equal partner with Chan in the films success. As played by Coogan Fogg is not a smooth dandy or a man of the world like David Niven in the 1956 film. Rather hes a hyper- sensitive easily ruffled and hopelessly clumsy scientist circa 1899 -- a fellow good-looking enough to be a leading man but far too scattered ever to figure that out. When he meets Lau Xing he hires him on the spot to test his latest device a horseless carriage presumably one of the worlds first. He has the car on a track but when he gets the speed past 50 mph the car gets loose and flies through the London streets. Related Stories A light touch keeps Around aloft / Globe-trotting remake steers clear of cliche In another film particularly another Disney film this mishap might have been an occasion for unfocused zaniness a big commotion presented without invention. Not here. Here the bit is worked out meticulously and extensively (as in a Jackie Chan movie). Its funny. It delivers in a slapstick way and its the first clue that this picture will not be a phoned-in entertainment. Foggs around-the-world voyage is undertaken as the result of a bet he makes with the president of the royal science institute Lord Kelvin a supercilious mediocrity played with villainous gusto by Jim Broadbent. The unsavory nature of the institutes hierarchy is emphasized in the casting which finds some of the most pasty-faced unhealthy looking actors to play Kelvins underlings. Throughout the subsequent journey Fogg and Lau Xing have to keep fighting off Kelvins thugs and also the martial arts henchmen of an evil female war lord (Karen Joy Morris). Fortunately these fights are never tiresome and the movie doesnt ever quite repeat itself. One sequence is a little marvel. Fogg and a young woman are hovering some 30 or 40 feet above ground in a hot air balloon while Lau Xing hangs from a rope fighting off the warlords men and struggling to climb back into the basket. The movie finds lively and enjoyable ways to keep the sequence going. At one point Chan hanging from the rope looks into a womans apartment and sees a fire starting. He jumps in through a window puts out the fire then goes out another window leaping for and catching the rope as the balloon glides by. Cantinflas never had it this difficult. Monique an impetuous young artist who meets Fogg and insists that she be allowed to accompany him is played by Cecile de France a charming Belgian actress who made a strong impression as the lesbian roommate in the French hit ""LAuberge Espagnole."" She is an important part of the ""Around the World"" chemistry providing a touch of romance and an unexpected dash of shrewd insolence. The movie doesnt need injections of energy but it gets them anyway from surprise cameos and theyre welcome all the same. In one of the better ones Gov. Schwarzenegger makes a very funny appearance as Prince Hapi a lecherous narcissistic Turkish sultan. Comedy has always been a strong suit for Schwarzenegger but the sight of him here in a long curly black wig is one for the books. He made the film before running for office. Before making this film director Frank Coracis best-known credits were for ""The Waterboy"" and ""The Wedding Singer"" two of the better Adam Sandler vehicles. Still its one thing for a director to make passable movies with a dead weight and quite another for him to be let loose to work with genuinely talented people. Coraci has given us a film that is not only amusing but well-acted and not only well-acted but gorgeous. Micha Kleins animated transitions alone which are used to signal each change in location are wondrous and lovely to behold. -- Advisory This film contains some mild sex humor.

Around the World in 80 Days Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/around-the-world-in-80-days-2004,200,aroundtheworldin80days16,aroundtheworldin80days,rogerebert
"In 80 Days the kicks are strictly for kids - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In 80 Days the kicks are strictly for kids By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  June 16 2004 By my count the total number of countries visited in ""Around the World in 80 Days"" comes to six which is something less than your average Carnival Cruise. To be fair ""Around the World in 80 Days"" doesnt have Kathie Lee Gifford. But only because the producers probably couldnt afford her.For a planet-spanning action/adventure epic ""80 Days"" is a pretty good Jackie Chan movie -- although it helps if you can blank out the scenes in which Arnold Schwarzenegger in a fright wig plays a lusty Turkish prince. Executive-produced by the ageless kung fu/comedy dynamo and directed by Frank Coraci (""The Wedding Singer"") its a peppy fast-moving wafer-thin amusement thats fine for kids if you dont mind a lot of Three Stooges-style martial arts. For grown-ups its the equivalent of a 59-cent tin globe.The last time Jules Vernes 1872 fantasy novel was turned into a movie it won the 1956 best picture Oscar even if that film is remembered now as a case of quantity winning out over quality. Showman-producer Mike Todd spared no expense and stuffed the cast with winking star cameos Frank Sinatra as a saloon pianist Buster Keaton as a train conductor Peter Lorre as a Japanese waiter and so on.The new version . . . spares expense. As the British inventor Phileas Fogg (Steve Coogan of ""24 Hour Party People"") and his crafty valet Passepartout (Chan) dash around the world on a bet they run into such luminaries as Virgin Airlines CEO Richard Branson John Cleese as a British bobby Singer Macy Gray as a sleeping woman Director Coraci cant even rely on his status as Friend of Adam Sandler to prevail on the ""Waterboy"" star to show up -- the best we get is Rob Schneider as a smelly bum.On the upside when Fogg and Passepartout encounter Wilbur and Orville Wright were treated to Owen and Luke Wilson dithering as only brothers can. Never mind that the scene takes place in the American desert when to my knowledge the Wrights never made it across the Rockies. Chans the man after all who gave us a ""Rumble in the Bronx"" with snowcapped mountains somewhere off in Westchester.The plot gets going when Lau Xing (Chan) steals a valuable jade Buddha from the British Museum with the hopes of returning it to his home village. Meanwhile scatterbrained Fogg has made a bet with the harrumphing Lord Kelvin (Jim Broadbent) of the Royal Academy of Science that he cant circumnavigate the globe in under 80 days. Lau Xing needs a lift home and so passes himself off as Passepartout butler extraordinaire.In Paris the two pick up Monique (Cecile de France) a perky would-be Impressionist painter and love interest for Fogg. But just when youre thinking shes an improvement over Shirley MacLaines Arab princess in the 1956 version here comes the sitting Governor of California in his last and surely least role before getting elected. This ""80 Days"" sidesteps the smirking racism of the original except for those 10 minutes when Schwarzenegger is onscreen as a royal Muslim muscleman; its a painfully clueless bit of brownface that would set back Hollywood-Arab relations if there were any.Coogan normally a brisk and witty actor breezes through on pleasant autopilot and ""80 Days"" feels most at home when it settles down in the Chinese village and lets Chan do his comedy-action thing against the legions of dragon-lady General Fang (Karen Joy Morris known to Asian audiences as Karen Mok). The star has done it before and better but even the old kung fu ladder gag still gets a laugh. ""Around the World in 80 Days"" goes by train ship hot air balloon and flying machine but it becomes airborne only when Chan does. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.
