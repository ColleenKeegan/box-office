Starring Donnie Yen Louis Koo and Collin Chou. Directed by Wilson Yip. (R. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) Donnie Yen executes two beat-downs before the opening credits of ""Flash Point"" the latest Hong Kong action picture from the martial arts master. It works out to about a punch every four seconds. At 44 years old Yen quite cant keep up that pace. But his latest movie has a solid story which keeps things interesting during the quiet moments when nobody is getting kicked in the head. And even though Yen is arguably 10 or more years past his high-flying prime hes exploring new martial arts disciplines giving his action scenes in this movie a fresh look. The subtitled ""Flash Point"" takes place more than a decade ago which is fitting because so much of it is filmed like a 1990s American action movie. Specifically director Wilson Yip seems to be going for a ""Lethal Weapon"" vibe with heavy elements of camaraderie and light banter villains who are unrealistically menacing and even background music that seems suspiciously similar to the Eric Clapton guitar work from that series. Yen is Jun Ma a detective who gets results but is still on the edge of suspension because too many of his suspects end up badly beaten or dead. If youre bothered that hes a cliche that dates back to ""Dirty Harry"" then this may not be the movie for you. Because theres also a rising gang member who doesnt play by the rules some kindly colleagues who arent long for this world and a partner (Louis Koo) who is always getting himself into trouble. While his movie character cant fight very well Koo is arguably the lead actor getting more lines and screen time than Yen who is basically an attack dog - staying mostly in the background until the action starts. Its a nice arrangement for the audience allowing the more dashing Koo (so good in the ""Triad Election"" movies) to drive the narrative forward while Yen takes over for the fight scenes. And those scenes supervised closely by action director Yen are mostly great. Yen has developed a recent passion for mixed martial arts and his more traditional punches and flying kicks are supplemented by some close-quarters Muay Thai kicks and even some jujitsu submission holds. Ultimate Fighting Championship fans will be happy. Yen also likes to discover new talent and isnt afraid to showcase existing talent that might overshadow his own skills. Collin Chou is appropriately mean as a gangster. And relative newcomer Yu Xing despite his penchant for dressing like Sylvester Stallone in ""Rocky II"" brings a menacing energy to a henchman role. -- Advisory This film contains strong language violence and a cranky partner who is too old for this %. - Peter Hartlaub Never Back Down Youth drama. Starring Sean Faris Amber Heard Djimon Hounsou and Cam Gigandet. Directed by Jeff Wadlow (PG-13. 113 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""Never Back Down"" is a junior version of ""Fight Club"" only with no movie stars and different moves. The killer sport practiced by a group of Orlando teens is called mixed martial arts - or MMA as insiders say. Its a combination of wrestling karate judo sambo and other exotic disciplines. The boys compete like Roman gladiators in front of a noisy crowd that eggs them on. There will be blood and copious amounts of it. Closing your eyes to avoid excess gore - one fighter practically has the skin ripped off his face for example - only helps so much. The amplified sound of bodies being slammed together or scraped along the floor or of kicks administered full force to limbs creates a picture in your mind even if youre not looking. Around these competitions the filmmakers have fashioned a formulaic story of a troubled teenager Jake (Sean Faris) who moves from Iowa to Orlando after his father is killed in a car crash for which Jake blames himself. A star football player in Iowa Jake achieves legendary status by beating up a competitor who calls his dad a drunk. His new classmates have seen the fight on YouTube and are anxious to initiate him in MMA. YouTube plays a major role in ""Never Back Down."" Theres a sense that everything these youngsters do is fodder for videotape. To the extent this is true private moments hardly exist. The class bully Ryan (Cam Gigandet) goads Jake into a fight before hes ready using the sexy Baja (Amber Heard) as bait. Jake who lives with his mother and brother in a small condo is in awe when he arrives at Ryans mansion for a party. It could be the Playboy mansion with two girls kissing in a bubble bath and a bunch more hanging out at the pool in bikinis. Looking around Jake realizes the only way hell ever best Ryan and get Bajas attention is in a competition. Jeff Wadlow who won a contest paying 1 million to make his first film ""Cry Wolf"" directs ""Never Back Down"" at a frenzied pace as if building up anticipation for Jake and Ryans first rumble. Jakes flashbacks to his fathers death appear in fast motion. After losing the first fight Jake studies mixed martial arts under a master (Djimon Hounsou). You might wonder what a two-time Oscar nominee is doing in a movie for teens. Far from acting like hes slumming he brings great dignity to the role not to mention muscles. The fights are parceled out at intervals during the last half all leading to a climactic battle. But its hard to build suspense when you know it is coming and you know who will win. Faris is movie-star handsome but rather stiff in scenes calling for him to be emotional. You dont buy his attachment to Baja. Heard is more energetic during the romantic parts but the costume department isnt doing her any favors by dressing her so scantily. Most of the men in the audience will have their attention diverted from whatever she has to say. Gigandet the best known of the trio from his starring role on ""The OC"" shamelessly overacts flaring his nostrils to show Ryans contempt for Jake. ""Never Back Down"" pretty much goes by the book for this kind of movie. But one scene sticks out. In a classic literature course the teacher asks about the significance of Achilles shield. From the students interest you wonder if theyre thinking it could come in handy at the next MMA meet. -- Advisory Gore fight scenes and provocative clothing. - Ruthe Stein Lagerfeld Confidential Documentary. Directed by Rodolphe Marconi with Karl Lagerfeld and Nicole Kidman. (Not Rated. 87 minutes. At the Roxie. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) Like a shark Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld is in constant motion seems never to sleep and never looks back. ""The good old days?"" he says. ""Who cares?"" A new documentary written filmed and directed by French filmmaker and interviewer Rodolphe Marconi takes the viewer to Lagerfelds Paris apartment to a photo shoot (with Nicole Kidman) on planes limos backstage and to his atelier. After all of this the film provides only a tantalizing glimpse into what makes this peripatetic veteran influential fashion designer tick. It is Lagerfeld not Marconi who is in control. In 1982 Lagerfeld revitalized Coco Chanels fashion house and has since become as much a celebrity as its founder. Known equally for his own costume (white ponytail high-starched collars and multiple rings) as the ones he creates for the runway Lagerfeld admits hes only the messenger. He sketches; everyone else does all the work. The camera hangs back and lets us see what the filmmaker sees. We see Lagerfeld at his messy desk where he sketches elaborate detailed outfits with astonishing speed. We listen to his views on marriage (so ""bourgeois"") fashion (""fashion is ephemeral dangerous and unfair"") and friendships (far and few between). His 30-year romantic relationship with aristocrat Jacques de Bascher who is never named and who died of AIDS is barely alluded to. But Lagerfeld has no problem talking about his homosexuality which he accepted and acted upon very early in life. The German-born Lagerfeld a spoiled ""unbearable"" child whose mother was both severe and adoring grew up to be an arrogant acerbic eccentric adult who in this film resists or dodges many of his interviewers questions. Hes a private man despite allowing the cameras so close. Solitude is his sustenance. ""I hate people who cant be alone"" he says. Lagerfeld is known in the fashion world for his obsession with books art and music but Marconi doesnt ask how the arts inspire the designer or inform his work. Lagerfeld says only that sometimes entire runway collections including the set design come to him ""in a dream."" Marconi seems less concerned with exploring the creative process of design or the inner workings of the fashion industry than getting Lagerfeld to spill some secrets. In the end Marconis point of view makes for an ultimately frustrating if still fascinating 87 minutes of cinema. - Sylvia Rubin Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who Animation. With the voices of Jim Carrey Steve Carell and Carol Burnett (G. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) Horton may hear a Who but the rest of us may hear a lot of hoopla and its not all the charming sort you expect from a benign Seussian world. ""Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" succeeds to a point in putting the Hollywood spin on Theodor S. Geisels beloved childrens book about an elephant defending a microscopic civilization. Very young children will find plenty to giggle over in the manic slapstick of this latest computer-animated adventure from Blue Sky Studios the outfit behind the ""Ice Age"" flicks. And Blue Skys creations are a solid transmutation of Seuss odd storybook world into digital images. Seuss rhymes generally give way to loud pratfall nonsense though as the filmmakers stretch a thin thin story to fit a feature-length movie. The result is more amiable than the live-action ""Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" starring Jim Carrey who returns to Who-Ville this time as the voice of Horton the elephant. And ""Horton"" is a huge leap beyond the atrocious live-action ""The Cat in the Hat"" with Mike Myers. All three Seuss renderings share a common problem The padding needed to take them to the big screen diminish the story leaving more to gawk at but less to savor. Computer-animation veterans Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino both making their directing debuts quickly establish the colorful carefree life in the jungle of Nool where the happy Horton co-exists with a menagerie of strange critters. His buddies include the gabby mouse Morton (Seth Rogen) while the creatures of Nool live under the thumb of the self-righteous Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) the snooty equivalent of a small-minded PTA mom. Horton incurs the wrath and ridicule of Kangaroo as he insists hes made an astonishing discovery - an endangered land called Who-Ville that exists in a tiny speck resting on a clover. Kangaroo maintains that if you cant see something it cant exist forcing Horton to sneak about in communicating with the mayor of Who-Ville (Steve Carell) as the elephant seeks a haven for the tiny town safe from predators and other dangers. While Carrey and Carell do a lot of jabbering the voice cast - which also includes Jaime Pressly Jonah Hill and husband and wife Will Arnett and Amy Poehler - sounds fairly plain and anonymous. The exception is Charles Osgood who brings his folksiest manner as narrator offering up soothing snippets of Seuss rhymes. Screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio whose credits include ""The Santa Clause 2"" and ""College Road Trip"" fill in the gaps around Osgoods homey narration mostly with frantic forgettable patter. There was barely material enough for the 1970 half-hour TV version of ""Horton Hears a Who"" so imagine the stretching and stuffing that went into this. Everything Horton does drags on rather tediously. Still the animation itself is vibrant occasionally dazzling loaded with detail that helps bring the whimsy of Seuss world to life. And theres Seuss moral - that a ""persons a person no matter how small."" - David Germain Associated Press Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

"Never Back Down | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; never-back-down ) Never Back Down (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Strictly speaking Never Back Down is not a remake but it might as well be. The premise is familiar underdog achieves self respect through training with a master then puts it all together for the big fight. Like a pop song suffering from overplay Never Back Down hits all the expected notes but feels tired and stirs no emotion. When one considers where Million Dollar Baby took this concept it becomes all the more depressing how little creativity exists in Never Back Downs DNA. Theres no reason to see this film - everyone in the audience knows not only what the starting and finishing points are but the trajectory that will propel events from one to the other. Those with a craving for the story would be better off re-watching The Karate Kid than enduring this lackluster re-telling. Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) is a mild-mannered guy with a quick-trigger temper. Mention his fathers death in a drunk driving accident and hell go ballistic. His reputation precedes him to his new high school in Orlando. The school hotshot/bully Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet) wants to teach the newcomer a lesson by giving him a beating. He accomplishes this by using his attractive girlfriend Baja (Amber Heard) to lure Jake to a party where Ryan is waiting. Initially Jake refuses to fight but after Ryan speaks the magic words about Jakes father the game is on. With cell phone cameras capturing every moment of the action Jake gets the crap beaten out of him. The next day accompanied by his new geeky friend Max (Evan Peters) Jake visits a gym for a little training. There a big black version of Mr. Miyagi named Jean Roqua (Djimon Honsou) takes Jake under his wing and prepares him for the inevitable re-match. Ho-hum. I guess one could argue that the fight scenes have some energy although in comparison to the recent Step Up 2 the Streets an equally formulaic dance movie the action lacks flair. Its hard to imagine die-hard mixed martial arts fans getting excited by what Never Back Down has to offer - it presents their sport as gladiatorial street fighting and the figures who engage in it as thugs and sadists. Not exactly a positive picture. And in evaluating the battles that bookend the main narrative its necessary to note that when events are pre-determined it takes away a lot of the fun. We know Jake is going to lose the first fight and win the last one. These things are not in doubt. So what is there to hold the viewers interest? A lackluster teen romance lifted directly out of The O.C.? Training sequences in which Jake gradually learns how to give up his anger and channel his energy in the right way? Never Back Down is paint-by-numbers filmmaking that doesnt deviate the slightest bit from the pattern. All thats missing from those training montages is ""Gonna Fly Now."" Does Djimon Honsou channel the late Pat Morita? Not really even though both actors play variations of the same character separated by two decades. Honsou is fine as the mentor who influences by dispersing tough love and tougher advice. The sad thing is that the twice Oscar-nominated Honsou is capable of much more and to see him reduced to playing this role is almost as painful as watching Cuba Gooding Jr. in Daddy Day Care. Meanwhile the resemblance between Sean Faris and Tom Cruise circa Risky Business is uncanny. However while Faris may have Cruises looks he doesnt have the mega-stars unforced charisma. Despite his limitations he has no difficulty out-acting his pretty but uninspired love interest Amber Heard and the movies ever-smirking villain Cam Gigandet (who unsurprisingly is a veteran of The O.C.). If the purpose of a movie like this is to recycle a stock plot and present it unchanged with different actors going through the motions and mouthing lame dialogue then Never Back Down does what its intended to do and director Jeff Wadlow hits the mark. If however a movie like this is supposed to energize an audience into caring about the main character and investing something in his success it doesnt happen. Never Back Down is too vanilla too lifeless for even the most open-minded viewer to connect with such one-dimensional screen personalities. This movie isnt bad just because it follows a formula slavishly but because it does so without verve or passion.

Sean Faris who looks like Eric Bana Jr. plays a teenage Iowa football player who transfers to a new school in Florida where he immediately forgets about football. Instead a local bully (Cam Gigandet) goads him into an X-treme form of hand-to-hand combat ""mixed martial arts"" and humiliates him at a party in front of the whole school. Its the kind of fight where you can do pretty much everything to your opponent except call in an artillery strike. After 20 minutes its clear that were going to spend the rest of the movie simply waiting for the new guy to beat the bully and get the girl. But he does the latter halfway through the movie leaving us with an hour of padding. So get ready for a bunch of training montages - one of them is a training montage about the trainer (Djimon Hounsou) - plus several scenes in tight succession in which the good guy the villain and the Hounsou figure all whine about their daddy issues. Also we keep cutting away to watch the heros little brother play tennis. By the time we get back to the ass-kicking X-treme boredom has set in. Running time 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence profanity sexual situations all involving teens). At the Empire the 84th Street the Kips Bay others.

(128) Unrated. Sexually suggestive during one memorable song. At the IFC Center. Its not easy being Meat Loaf. The man born Marvin Lee Aday had a childhood that as recounted briefly here was marred by his obesity. But his early struggles with his weight yielded a memorable stage name and in 1977 that name and its equally oversized persona exploded onto the pop-music scene with ""Bat Out of Hell"" a still-terrifically listenable album that became one of the all-time bestsellers and remains a seminal music achievement of the late 1970s. Flash-forward 30 years and director Bruce David Klein finds a 59-year-old performer whos still big-boned still in love with histrionics and who still gives his all on stage (resulting in some alarming post-show deflatings that involve writhing about on the floor). But if Meat Loafs voice doesnt have the operatic intensity it did when he was a long-haired unlikely sex symbol growling about ""Paradise by the Dashboard Light"" and bloody-thorned all-consuming love the man himself is still larger-than-life. A genial figure in person and a yet-to-be-appreciated movie heavy (hes given good turns in ""Leap of Faith"" ""Crazy in Alabama"" and especially ""Fight Club"" and was of course the ill-fated deliveryboy in 1975s ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"") Meat - as everyone calls him - is now a sort-of father figure to his band and Klein catches him in a few revealing moments. An unexpectedly touching scene comes when in order to fend off criticism of lechery as he and his sexy backup singer Aspen Miller enact onstage the teenage love-tussle sung about in ""Dashboard Light"" he has his band dress up in late 70s garb to capture the songs original moment of conception. As he tries on a long-haired wig that echoes his youthful self he smiles shyly and says that when he futzed with the hair in the mirror ""It felt exactly right exactly right."" Every man even Meat Loaf is shocked when he realizes hes old. Its a shame Klein couldnt capture more moments like that; instead theres a lot of bland onstage rehearsals sound checks and affirmations from friends and collaborators that Meat is a dedicated family man and artist. (Notably missing is Jim Steinman whose stage-ready songs made ""Bat"" soar and who teamed again with the big guy on 1993s ""Bat Out of Hell II Back Into Hell"" but wisely avoided 2006s ""Bat Out of Hell III The Monster Is Loose."") As a result what emerges isnt a peek into musical psychodrama on a par with the revelatory 2004 Metallica documentary ""Some Kind of Monster."" Instead ""Meat Loaf In Search of Paradise"" feels like a VH1 slice-of-life with all the toppings. Yet it benefits from the fact that even a slice of its title subject is a full meal. - Joe Neumaier WETLANDS PRESERVED3 starsChronicle of a now-shuttered Tribeca nightclub/social activist center. At the Cinema Village (136). NR drug and alcohol references.With its carefully-chosen soundtrack funky animation and enthusiastic interviews Dean Budnicks affectionate documentary pays apt tribute to Wetlands a local landmark that closed in 2001. Built ""for Deadheads by Deadheads"" the club was - as the Grateful Deads Bob Weir notes - a major factor in the nascent jam band scene of the early Nineties. Still while Blues Traveler was the unofficial house band owner Larry Bloch encouraged a broad mix that also blended hip-hop hardcore and er Hanson. But as artists like John Popper Dave Matthews and Mike Gordon observe Wetlands was about more than music. Bloch was committed to making the world a better place and turned his Hudson Street club into a hub of political activism. One interviewee who notes the venues Sixties-inspired identity complains that theres no such thing as ""good"" nostalgia. Those who see this movie are bound to disagree. - Elizabeth WeitzmanSPUTNIK MANIA 3 starsDocumentary on the 1950s space race and beginning of the Cold War. At the IFC Center (127). Not rated Bomb explosions. The flip side of ""Mad Mens"" lush 1950s life was the rising temperature of the Cold War an appetite-killing TV dinner that Americans sat down to nightly after Russias 1957 launch of the worlds first satellite. As it circled the globe Sputnik left paranoia in its wake. Within a year H-bomb testing increased and fear in the U.S. went sky-high. The archival footage here is great and the cosmos-conquering craziness will satisfy space-race nuts. But the small budget is obvious so director David Hoffman couldnt go from the Earth to the moon on every detail. - Joe Neumaier NEVER BACK DOWN2 starsA teenager grapples with his anger and fights a local bully by joining an underground street-fighting club. At area theaters (153). R Violence sexuality profanity. Teenage Jake and his kid brother Charlie (Sean Faris and Wyatt Smith looking like two ages of Tom Cruise) move from Iowa to Florida; Jakes anger issues get him noticed by a junior-edition fight club as well as by Baja (Amber Heard). But by the time ever-noble ever-watchable Djimon Hounsou shows up to teach earnest young Jake honor and roundhouse kicks the power-rock and smashmouth idiocy become like a fever dream sweaty and hard to shake off. - Joe Neumaier TOWARDS DARKNESS 2 starsThriller about a kidnapping in Colombia. At the Quad (132). R Violence language. In English and Spanish with subtitles. The Colombian tourist board wont be too happy about Antonio Negrets intermittently compelling thriller which presents his native country as a cesspool of corruption and violence. Abductions in his own family inspired this story of Jose (Roberto Urbina) a kidnapped photographer whose desperate father (Tony Plana) enlists the help of American agents. As the ransom is raised we get glimpses of the life Jose hopes to see again. The sentimental flashbacks (with America Ferrera as Joses ex) feel rushed and empty though. Negret is clearly less interested in imagining a fictional romance than in conveying his vision of a land that has lost its way. - Elizabeth Weitzman Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Never Back Down (PG-13) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Never Back Down (PG-13) 1/2 No surprise knockout from this by-the-numbers martial arts drama. Sean Faris left and Djimon Hounsou go a few rounds in Never Back Down. Share Print Save to your profile By Donald Munro A mostly predictable martial-arts flick Never Back Down threads some standard themes -- alienated young man moves to new school and has to fight for his honor -- with the contemporary mindset of the digital age. The Internet isnt just alluded to in this story; it drives it. In a world in which the performances of everyday life are easily saved for posterity what you do on one side of campus (or the country) can make the rounds faster than old-fashioned word of mouth. Thats the case with the brooding Jake (a solid Sean Faris) whose reputation for fighting precedes him when he moves to a new school in Orlando the land of tourist attractions and -- apparently -- a thriving underground fighting industry. At his old school a bystander with a video camera caught him in a savage fight on the football field. In earlier times a new kid entering a new school might have a chance at starting afresh. Not Jake. Thanks to YouTube hes already pegged as a willing warrior. Thats how Jake finds himself pitted against the blustery Ryan (Cam Gigandet) the ultra-bad guy on campus. (It just so happens that Ryan has a cute but vaguely dissatisfied girlfriend played by Amber Heard and you can see where thats going from a couple of theme parks away.) In need of further martial-arts training Jake turns to a hardened mentor Jean Roqua (an expectedly tough Djimon Hounsou) who runs a local gym specializing in mixed-martial arts. Director Jeff Wadlow finds a sort of nobility in the subject matter than you might not expect for a film that consists in large part of bloodthirsty mobs clamoring for violence. Rather than impose a simple-minded moralistic message Wadlow manages to revel in the martial-arts action while exploring societys conflicted messages about honor pacifism and glorifying violence. The most interesting part of the film however isnt the actual fight scenes -- which are handled with the bone-crunching athleticism youd expect complete with special effects of X-rayed limbs cracking before our eyes -- but the way that the spectators drive the action. In his first confrontation with the menacing Ryan bystanders dont offer to help the overwhelmed Jake whose jiggly mouthful of blood has splattered in slow-mo glory across the screen. They take pictures instead.

"Never Back Down Realism takes a sucker punch | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNever Back Down Realism takes a sucker punch Romance along with the martial arts wisdom is a sideline in a movie devoted primarily to rousing visceral excitement. By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. March 14 2008Starring Sean Faris Amber Heard Cam Gigandet and Djimon Hounsou. Directed by Jeff Wadlow. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14ASome things in Hollywood never change. In the heyday of the western cowboys would absorb enough punishment in a barroom fight to render an ox comatose. But these combatants would just pick themselves off the floor and brush themselves off.The same is true today - a physical battering that would land an ordinary person in the hospital for a month is nothing to the heroes of our thrillers and cop movies. In one scene from Never Back Down the young Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) gets punched kicked kneed choked cut torn slammed around and when he finally gets up from the blood-spattered parking lot he looks like hes been through nothing more than a sweaty dance at the prom.But why complain on grounds of realism? Tyler does not live on planet Earth but planet Hollywood formula where the storm clouds of Fight Club hang over the once charming but now seedy landscape of The Karate Kid.Article Continued BelowTyler a student in an Orlando high school where mixed martial arts is extremely popular trains with a mixed martial arts expert Jean Roqua (Djimon Hounsou). Hounsou who has been nominated for two Oscars for supporting actor in Blood Diamond and In America lends gravitas to his formulaic role which involves uttering pithy words of advice with a faintly metaphysical tinge. ""You beat yourself if you dont control your breathing"" he insists.Is your opponent kneeling on top of your chest and pounding your face into mush? ""You can always change your position"" the wise trainer says. ""You just have to find a way.""Tyler learns well enough to acquire a girlfriend Baja Miller (Amber Heard) according to the age-old principle that the brave deserve the fair but this romance along with the martial arts wisdom is a sideline in a movie devoted primarily to rousing visceral excitement. To this end director Jeff Wadlow a relative newcomer relies on tried and true mechanical devices - a pounding rock score a hyperactive camera an unrelenting series of close-ups. There is one long shot in the movie where the camera pulls back to reveal a regiment of partying teenagers cavorting around swimming pools while a character remarks ""You cant get much better than this.""

"In Never Back Down teens fight for attention - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In Never Back Down teens fight for attention Sean Faris plays Jake the new kid at an Orlando high school. (GENE PAGE) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / March 14 2008 Call ""Never Back Down"" ""The Karate Kid"" for MySpace cadets. Call it ""Teen Fight Club."" Call it ""So You Think You Can Brawl."" While youre noticing how this roughhouse drama is just like a bunch of other movies and reality shows its worth singling out for courageously showing us what boys really want - sure theyre into cars and action and stuff. Some of them even like girls. But what they crave more than anything is to be popular. So thank you ""Never Back Down"" for confirming what CW has been suggesting for over a year High school boys are the new high school girls.Jake (Sean Faris) is the new guy at some Orlando public school (hes a lapsed quarterback from Iowa). Since his dad died in a car accident hes been moody petulant and arrest-prone. Video of his famous ""Friday Night Lights""-style gridiron brawl has been virally spread all over his new school where the kids now check him out in the halls.It used to be a nice face and good dental work made you a star. Here its the public awareness that you can knock out a dudes teeth. When Baja (Amber Heard) the school blonde flirts with Jake over his knowledge of ""The Iliad"" gives him her number and invites him to a party he breaks into a Sunny-D smile.The party is at somebodys tacky Grecian mansion. Its so Orlando and its all good (girls make out in hot tubs; that sort of thing). But then Ryan (Cam Gigandet) introduces himself. He runs the school combat club and rather than hit Jake with some lame come-on line he gets right to the point ""I saw the clip and you can bang."" Off comes Ryans shirt. Jake looks over at Baja and she looks away. Suddenly Baja is Mexican for ""Dude I pimped her out to get you here. Now lets fight."" But Jake demurs until Ryan talks trash about his dad. Its not much of a fight. Ryan appears to know Muay Thai and Krav Maga; hes got a ground game. His opponent just wants to box.The next hour and a half is spent getting Jake in shape for the Beatdown the movies climactic fight that doubles as a guerilla social event. His Mr. Miyagi is none other than Djimon Hounsou playing a Senegalese mixed-martial-arts expert named Jean Roqua. Roqua has had tragedy in his life too. But for reasons that make no sense he more or less elects Jake as star pupil. The kid insults the instructor. He breaks all his rules forcing Roqua to go all Djimon Hounsou on him (the hoarse screaming the glassy eyes). Then they heal. Hes actually less Pat Morita and more Barbra Streisand in ""The Prince of Tides.""Jake has the occasional run-in with Ryan. But Ryan is an exhibitionist. Why fight in a bathroom where no one else can see? Save it for the finale. ""Never Back Down"" has all these television drama properties - the nonstop pop-rock soundtrack the family angst the commercial-break story pauses. Plus wasnt Gigandet that cocky surfer Kevin on the ""O.C.""? Here hes baby Brad Pitt in ""Fight Club"" - fatless kind of dangerous but needy attention is photosynthetic for him. Faris looks like Tom Cruise and the guy who played the most recent Superman.The movie is interesting for what it implies about Jake and Ryan and their friends. When you take a show like ""The Ultimate Fighter"" and give it a plot and some acting the violence is no longer just a sport. Its sex. And when one character is lured into somebodys mansion and beaten almost to death its rape. So maybe something really has changed in American high schools. Or maybe this is just the filmmakers way of making us think something has. Either way the movie is just a cheesy preposterous semi-eroticized way of yelling ""Fight Fight"" when two people go at it in the school cafeteria. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

Though it telegraphs its punches too obviously the pugilism-and-perspiration epic ""Never Back Down"" has all the ingredients to be a knockout at the B.O. and in the DVD market. Popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship will undoubtedly help as will the mellers glorification of violence and rationalization of revenge. Best part though is the cast Everyones a model everyone beats each other half to death and no one looks as if theyve ever suffered so much as a coldsore. Sean Faris who more than resembles a young Tom Cruise (and no doubt has stable of people promoting that very idea) is Jake Tyler an angry young man from Iowa who winds up in Orlando Fla. with his mom (Leslie Hope) and younger brother (Wyatt Smith). He immediately gets drafted into the local fight-club scene via a vicious beating from local bully Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet). As anyone who has ever seen a boxing movie any kind of sports movie or even a Western can tell you the entire narrative will be focused on how when and why Jake beats the living daylights out of Ryan. This isnt giving anything away any more than itd be giving away the plot of summer to say that birds fly south for the winter. The tantalizing question is how the pic will explain all the violence away. ""Never Back Down"" tries but not very hard. Helmer Jeff Wadlow showed promise with ""Cry Wolf"" (2005) but sometimes seems to think hes directing a commercial for beer cars and/or feminine hygiene products. So much narrative detail takes place during musical montages that theres barely time to get the requisite mean-spirited violence into the picture. But Wadlow manages. Faris is fine but pic has a far more charismatic star in Gigandet who is gleefully hatefully sadistic and evil as Jakes more skilled antagonist. Djimon Hounsou never seen enough is terrific doing the Pat Morita thing as Jean Roqua who runs the gym where Jake will learn not just mixed-martial-arts techniques but life-lessons too natch. Amber Heard on the other hand has to be seen to be believed. If there were an award for best coyly sexual biting of lower lip by an actress in a leading role she would win it hands down. Heard plays Baja (yes) the other side of the Jake-Ryan triangle and isnt done any favors by all the preposterous slow-mo entrances and babe-alicious posturing. Theres more than enough random flesh parading through ""Never Back Down"" that an actual performance by Heard (soon to be seen and far more appreciated in ""All the Boys Love Mandy Lane"") would have been welcome.""Never Back Down"" exists in a world of beautiful people beautiful homes and much unoccupied money where the rules of physics and physiology are on a serious vacation -- the human body cant do or withstand the things this movie claims it can and one can only hope that pics probable success doesnt trigger a dramatic rise in schoolyard body-slams arm locks and chokeholds.

The film is set in an Orlando high school where the main extracurricular activity is ""the Beatdown"" an underground mixed martial arts ring decorated with flirtatious girls in bikinis. Troubled Iowa transplant Jake Tyler (Sean Faris) suffers a lot of smirking from the no-good rich kids. They mock his homespun flannel shirts calling him ""Kurt Cobain"" -- evil rich kids can be so cruel -- and pick away at his father issues until his anger management issues result in brawling issues. Jake learns that the sort of two-fisted acting out he is prone to (because he blames himself for his dads drunken-driving death) is no match for the muay thai/krav maga/jiu jitsu stylings of Ryan (Cam Gigandet of ""The O.C."") the smirkiest rotten rich kid of all. Determined to win a rematch Jake studies with Jean Roquoa (Djimon Hounsou) whose cannonball biceps and cobblestone abs belie his soulful nature. Jean agrees to train Jake on the condition that he promise never to fight outside the gym a pledge the hothead finds difficult to keep. If that qualifies as a spoiler my apologies. You have had soup deeper than this film and a referee should have been on hand to call foul on the acting. But director Jeff Wadlow films the endless fight sequences with crisp authority. He shoots the rumbles with an eye for detail an understanding of the physics of tumbling bodies and an appreciation for the visual possibilities of rippling male musculature. He could have a grand future in gladiator movies.

"This Film Has No Punch washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On This Film Has No Punch Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday March 14 2008 ""Never Back Down"" is teensploitation at its most obvious -- a boneheaded cliche-rama built around six-pack-ab standoffs between preening studs. A movie that wants to copy the box-office success and appeal of ""Save the Last Dance"" and ""Fight Club"" it stars Tom Cruise-clone Sean Faris as Jake Tyler the cliched Edgy Outsider with the usual family issues at home who moves to a new school and has to break into a social circle with his fists. The competitive sport du jour is mixed martial arts in which kicking feet are part of the oh-so-choreographed backstreet duke-outs. After picking up pointers in this new contact sport Jake sets himself up for a tourney finale with ultimate bad boy Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet) which leads all but directly to winning the heart of the bodacious Baja (Amber Heard). Sitting through this is groan-inducing enough but its spiritually depressing to watch Djimon Hounsou who deserves better as Jakes ripped pugilist guru counseling the lad with fortune cookie wisdom. This is also the kind of ""plugged in"" movie in which the characters become instantly famous when their battles are broadcast over the Internet and are summoned to fights at the last minute by text messages.
