On the blokes side weve got Jon (Gordon-Levitt) nicknamed after the famous Spanish libertine. A fabled local lothario in New Jersey framed in every shot as the star of his own world he gets more sexual kicks from the lissom lovelies of hardcore pornography than he does his flesh and blood conquests. His counterpart is Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). Her romantic ideal is also founded on illusion but where Jons eyes glaze over when lost in a world of laptop-based humping and pumping her pupils dilate under the influence of an unreal cocktail of cliches derived from fluffy romcoms. Jon and Barbara suffer from the same disease with different symptoms. As a director Gordon-Levitt demonstrates considerable technical flair through stylistic flourishes and coaxes great performances out of his co-stars while he remains centre stage throughout. Be prepared for at least two shifts of gear in the story which mark the films clearly outlined three acts - but perhaps this is less a flaw in the film than in our expectations of where a movie like this might be heading. Redemption might not be on the cards for everybody.

Very much a story told through a mans eyes and a contrast to the romcom pulp usually served up. As an ex-catholic I particularly liked the confessional scenes and how they developed throughout the film and the benchmark of Hail Mary and Lords Prayers awarded it really was like that for me too As a night out I give it 4 not an oscar film but competently doneFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 21 2013MikeTFeaturedAs I said in my review of ""Gravity"" Time Out was great when it was paid for - it had no need to suck up to advertisers - reviews were fairly reliable. TOs review of Don Jon is way too generous - 4 star reviews should put a movie in the league of Oscar nominated films and this isnt going to receive award nominations. Joseph Gordon Levitts a great actor - I particularly liked ""50/50"". But though this is a good starting point in a joint writing/acting career its not worthy of 4 stars. The choices of co-stars is good - Julianne Moore is absolutely excellent as the older woman. Though I find Scarlett Johansson a very convincing actress somehow she didnt come across as well in this as she did in films like Vicky Christina Barcelona. The Don Jon storyline is quite good but there are definitely overtones of Travoltas character in Saturday Night Fever and the story was just too predictable for my liking - I found I couldnt care less for any of the characters. I hope JGL will continue to write/act/direct. But this movies definitely only worthy of 5/10 or 2.5 stars.

It has elements of Saturday Night Fever with JGL strutting his way to Confession. Thought the film was too black and white in parts and could have explored other concepts such as the fact that some couples watch porn together as a stimulant during s ex? I did like the films themes of self control addiction anger v mellow and controlling relationshipsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 16 2013ElaineFeaturedThis film provided a fresh funny look at the pressures of modern society on men women and relationships and it does entertain however too much time was given to the relationship with Scarlett Johansson. She plays the role really well but it seemed like they covered her and JGLs relationship for too long purely for the sake of having her on screen. Could have done with a bit more time spent on the relationship with Julianne Moore which was subtle touching and interesting. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 16 2013AsmaFeaturedCertainly worth a view - JGL has his finger on the pulse of what life and romance has become for us late twenty-somethings.

Its the third Scarlett Johansson movie Ive seen in 6 weeks (two in theatres one on my laptop) and I must say shes really maturing as an actress. The pacing was great the supporting cast brilliant and the storyline contemporary and novel. However I felt the ending a bit to facile and chopped.

On one hand you have a great cast with good pacing and fun comedic elements on the other hand a script which ignores the 3 act structure choosing to end the film hastily during the end of the 2nd act.

Its a fairly slim and rather one-dimensional premise to sustain across a full-length feature - that someone who spends their life immersed in internet porn naturally becomes disengaged from what is meaningful and real in life - with the inevitable redemption at the (very) last minute. Gordon-Levitts character is fairly unlikable throughout which is all part of the set-up I guess but did everything in the film - plotting character gags - all have to be so one-dimensional too? Theres no emotional complexity and so little nuance. This is no doubt deliberate but WE GET IT... hes just not a very nice guy - in fact we all got this after about the first five minutes and as a result we just dont care about him that much until he starts to grow up - about five minutes from the end of the film. There are some decent cameos - Scarlett Johansson enjoys herself royally as a New Joisey princess with a figure to die for and dreams of domesticating her man while Tony Danza as Jons vest-wearing sports-loving dinner-table patriarch comes close to stealing the show more than once. Worth a watch I suppose and entertaining in fits and starts but this is not the kooky funny and ultimately rewarding anti-romcom that say Silver Linings Playbook so effortlessly was and that I sneakingly suspect Gordon-Levett was trying to emulate. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 15 2013paula mellonFeaturedA very funny - and true film tackling the links between porn-life and real-life which I think they handled really well. Both sides of the coin were showed. Dont be put off by the porno theme it isnt that type of film.

"Don Jon - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Don Jon Posted by Christy Lemire on October 3 2013 Leave a Comment Relativity Media Rated R for strong graphic sexual material and dialogue throughout nudity language and some drug use. Running time 90 minutes. Three stars out of four. Joseph Gordon-Levitt turns the gym-tan-laundry routine into an art form with ""Don Jon"" his vibrant and viciously profane directorial debut. Gordon-Levitt who also wrote the script stars as the title character a Lothario who learns how to love. But for real you know what Im saying? His ""Don"" Jon Martello clearly was inspired by and could be friends with The Situation and the rest of the boys from ""Jersey Shore"" with the pecs and the abs the gold chain and the wife-beater tank top the muscle car and the Sunday Mass and -- most importantly of all -- the super-smooth way with women. But not just any women; as dictated by the highly scientific (and crass) methodology he and his club-hopping pals employ they must be at least an 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. Ideally theyre what Jon calls ""a dime."" He sounds like a horrible human being obsessed as he is with looks and cleanliness and perfection. analyzing everything numerically in hopes of maintaining a sense of control. And he might have been insufferably self-centered in the hands of any other actor -- but Gordon-Levitts innate charm cant help but shine through. Hes just so damned likable no matter what. Aside from ""Hesher"" in which he starred as a tatted long-haired squatter who leads a lonely kid down a road of debauchery hes never played a truly bad guy. And because there are some nuggets of his decency and vulnerability scattered throughout the script hes not a complete caricature and his characters ultimate redemption doesnt seem like such a longshot. But first Internet porn. Lots and lots of Internet porn. Despite the fact that Jon can bring home a gorgeous woman any night of the week he finds his true sexual fulfillment through brief snippets from the privacy of his own laptop. The overflow of objectification is numbing as it is meant to be. The sequencing in these segments is beautifully fluid with a rhythm that Gordon-Levitt repeats throughout the film. Sometimes he even sneaks off in the middle of the night while his latest conquest is snoozing in his bed just to rub one out to images of naughty schoolgirls in the darkness of his living room. Then one night at the club he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) whos a dime and change if ever there was one. But Barbara is also a good girl. Not only will she not give it up on the first night she wants to go on actual dates -- the romantic comedies she forces him to endure are a scream -- and meet each others friends and family. This brings us to Jons blue-collar childhood home in suburban New Jersey where the DNA is powerfully on display. Jons dad (an awesomely foul-mouthed Tony Danza) yells at football games on the TV which is just as much of an obsession as porn is to his son. (They also clearly share the same taste in clothes amusingly.) Mom (Glenne Headly as the stereotypically doting Italian mama) is preoccupied with finding Jon a nice girl to settle down with and start a family. And younger sister Monica (Brie Larson) remains mute regardless of the situation glued as she is to her smartphone. (The hugely versatile Larson ever-present these days does a lot with just the slightest facial expression.) Barbara seems perfect to Jon making him the envy of all his friends. But to the audience its obvious that shes demanding high-maintenance and materialistic. She might mean well in the ways she tries to shape him and her fairy-tale notions of romance surely seem pure in her own eyes -- but we know theyre doomed. In theory the character might have been a one-dimensional shrew with the French manicure and the pink lip gloss and the husky New York accent but Johansson finds some shadings of sweetness and humanity to her. One of the changes Barbara insists upon is that Jon return to night school to finish his degree rather than just tending bar. There he meets the other woman who will influence him an older fellow student named Esther (Julianne Moore) whos in a constant state of despondency. The relationship they forge seems unlikely on paper but each sees what he or she needs in the other in that exact moment. Totally unsurprisingly Moore brings a natural radiance and mature groundedness to the picture. Plus its clever little moment when the star of ""Boogie Nights"" hands Jon a DVD of Danish porn from the 70s. ""Don Jon"" is about the ways were preoccupied with image -- our own and everyone elses -- but its also about instant gratification. When Jon wants to get off quickly he turns on his laptop rather than turning on an actual human being. When hes late for Mass (and hes late every week) this good Catholic boy spews a stream of road-rage-fueled profanity from behind the wheel. Its only when he learns to slow down the routine hes perfected that he begins to enjoy the pleasure of patience.

Sabasaid on Saturday March 08 2014 40541 PMI usually agree with you Richard on most movies but you must have been really bored and desperate for a movie the week you saw this one. B+? Really? There was not a single thing interesting or original in this film. This is from someone who doesnt mind juvenile humor but this film was terrible; no real plot no interesting characters. You must really love Jersey Shore because this was just that 30 minute show turned into 120 minutes. Ill keep watching your reviews though because youre allowed a miss here and there.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 27 2013 Save for later Saved Don Jon stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (l.) and Scarlett Johansson (r.). Daniel McFadden/Relativity Media/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in and makes his feature directing debut in ""Don Jon"" a movie about a Don Juan with a porn addiction. Its a promising subject - a comedy about a lothario for the self-obsessed Internet era - and for a while both as actor and director Gordon-Levitt provides a racy jaunty tone. For all his wolfishness his Jon Martello Jr. is basically an affable lug. He meets his match with Scarlett Johanssons Barbara Sugarman a Jersey girl who wouldnt have been out of place on ""Jersey Shore.""It doesnt take long for her to get his number at which point the movie becomes increasingly soft-edged and sappy. True love beckons in the guise of a dingbat played by Julianne Moore and all is right with the world. As Jons father a man whose lifeblood is yelling Tony Danza is very funny. He makes you understand what his son is escaping from. Grade C+ (Rated R for strong graphic sexual material and dialogue throughout nudity language and some drug use.)

Grade C Joseph Gordon-Levitts debut as a writer-director-actor resembles a porn addicts ""Groundhog Day"" and not in a good way. Jon - his friends call him ""Don Jon"" - is such a one-track character and follows such an unvarying routine that he appears to be reliving the same 24 hours every day. A single bartender in New Jersey Jon cares about eight things his body pad ride family and church; his boys (buddies) girls (bedmates) and most of all porn. As the films star Gordon-Levitt performs with a calculated single-mindedness thats the opposite of the fluid intuitive acting he did as the cancer patient in ""50/50"" or the wild punk in ""Killshot."" For most of ""Don Jon"" Gordon-Levitt plays a wound-up character with predictable vehemence ticking off all the elements of his obsessive-compulsive disorder like clockwork from leaving a mirror squeaky-clean to maintaining his rep as the most successful pickup artist on the dance floor. Even when he skillfully calculates effects - like the concentrated come-hither glance Jon trains on potential sex partners - theyre just flashy and external. And when he lets up on the intensity he relaxes into stereotype. So it goes with his filmmaking. He devises scenes that are ridiculously easy-to-read emotionally and he repeats them in punchy montages as if familiarity will breed comedy. Jon and his two best friends rank pulchritude on a scale from one to ten. Jon attracts an 8 (his minimum) with his X-ray eyes then grinds with her on the dance floor and whisks her off to bed. Jon goes ballistic behind the wheel whenever a car slows in front of him. Jon dutifully confesses sins then uses his Hail Marys and Lord Prayers as workout chants. (If youre very impressionable you might take this as a profound comment on religion.) After sating himself with porn he flicks a tissue into his waste-backet. Little of this gets funnier the second or third time around. You might wish Jon cared more about his job Some tricky cocktail-mixer maneuvers a la ""Coyote Ugly"" or ""Cocktail"" might have relieved the monotony. Even if youre not a believer in the shopworn canard that a dramatist must ""show not tell"" (and Im not) theres something off-putting and emphatic about the way Gordon-Levitt shows and tells. Jon is explicit about why he prefers porn to sex with real women. Although hes vaguely street-smart he doesnt realize that the compliant females wholl do anything for a man in Internet porn are fantasy figures and mere aids to masturbation. He decides that if he ever meets the perfect 10 the sex will live up to his dreams. Thats when he spots Barbara at his favorite club. Played by Scarlett Johansson as a bodacious Jersey-girl cartoon she turns out to be every bit the escapist that he is except her fantasies are the Prince Charming variety. Shes so alluring and so controlling that he doesnt know what hits him when he starts acquiescing to her demands like taking a night course so he can rise in the world. When she objects to Jon cleaning his own apartment because she thinks its a turnoff even this narcissistic lug can sense theres something off about her. Besides the sex he has with Barbara still cant compete wit the rush he gets from porn. At its most likable ""Don Jon"" aims to parody prurient male fantasies prissy female fantasies and wholesome family fantasies. Tony Danza overacts exuberantly as Jons macho father who loves Barbaras voluptuous looks; Brie Larson understates deftly as his nearly silent sister glued to her smartphone (its a gag role with a great payoff). And Glenne Headley almost creates a life-worn character as his mother who says ""I look like a grandmother but do I have any grandchildren?"" To protect Jon from his parents and Barbaras conventionality and to wean him off porn Gordon-Levitt revives another stereotype - a quirky older woman with infinite sympathy humor understanding and sensuality. Julianne Moore with her characteristic resourcefulness plays this paragon as a one-woman counterculture. After she sees him sneaking a look at some porn on his phone she brings him superior artsy Danish porn from the 1970s. Soon she gives him a crash course in the meaning of love. This movie wants to hark back to the freewheeling American cinema of the 70s with Moore as the sexy magical ""kook."" But its just two parts smutty sitcom to one part daydream of redemption. Its as flimsy and disposable as Jons Kleenex.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Don Jon Love Lust and Loneliness Joseph Gordon-Levitts debut as writer-director is glib and fun--and even better when Julianne Moore is onscreen By Mary Pols MaryPolsSept. 26 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Daniel McFadden / Relativity Media Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture There tends to be some eye rolling--at least within the movie industrys insiders-and-hangers-on brigade (of which we film critics are a grumbly constituency)--when theres word of an actor who nurses dreams of being a director. Thats mainly because the assumption is that he or she will want to be terribly serious taking a sort of retaliatory jab at whatever crap roles theyve been roped into playing in the past. For instance if you are Angelina Jolie how better to excise the memory of playing a platinum-haired news bunny in Life or Something Like It than writing and directing the solemn Bosnian war film In the Land of Blood and Honey? But no one could accuse Joseph Gordon-Levitts debut as writer-director in the comedy Don Jon as being self-aggrandizing. At least 80% of it is snappy droll fluff while the other 20% is what you get when you persuade Julianne Moore to be in your movie in a word better. Gordon-Levitt plays Jon an iron-pumping churchgoing New Jersey boy with an unabashed love of pornography. He likes real girls too but sex with them is never quite as fulfilling as watching sex on his laptop while pleasuring himself. Ideally he gets in and gets out with the real girls and then gets online with his true loves. I will not detail all the reasons why this is the case for Jon but it has something to do with three-dimensional women wanting to look into his eyes--missionary is the worst--and their irritating habit of interrupting the act to speak of things that are not compliments related to size or speed. Also he is an excessively tidy fellow and tissues go more easily into the wastebasket than dates. He needs real women though if only to impress his ""boys"" Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke). Then one night at a club he meets what he calls a ""dime"" Barbara (Scarlett Johansson spot-on in her Jersey everything). Shes stunning sassy and a bit standoffish which turns Jon into a puddle glistening with hair oil. (MORE Qamp;A with Joseph Gordon-Levitt) To Jon Barbara oozes sex and what looks like serious class--Johansson makes Jersey Shore-tacky look like couture--but she doesnt put out. Which drives Jon crazy. It even seduces him into pursuing something that could very nearly be called a relationship. He cant have her unless he betters himself which includes signing up for night school. Johansson is first-rate at treading the line between needy kitten and demanding shrew. Ive never seen her have quite this much fun on a movie screen. Maybe she was just in the mood for a comedy or maybe Gordon-Levitt drew something out of her--who knows? And whatever Gordon-Levitts directorial instructions were to Tony Danza who plays Jons boorish father they were right on. Danza plays a cartoon but hes never been less of a cartoon and you see the origins of Jon the Don in the way his dad eyes Barbara at a family dinner and regards his boy with new respect as if hed just sold his startup for 100 million. I was never angered by the movies title character--hes just too ignorant to dislike and Gordon-Levitt even in lout mode has a sly cuteness that cant be squashed especially when hes revealing to us how young and unformed Jon really is--but I didnt particularly care about him. Thats why despite all the glib and amusing dialogue and flashy funny cuts of Jon going about his various bits of business the movie needs an intervention. It gets one in the form of Moores character Esther a fellow night-school student who mortifies him in class by asking if hes watching porn on his phone. Her characterization of the forthright but also damaged Esther is subtle but the payoff is vivid. In their subsequent if cautious friendship is a hint of Harold and Maude. Its implausible and seems to come out of left field--a movie in another genre entirely--but the sentiment involved is lovely. Whether the pastiche is deliberate or a young storytellers desperate grasp at a narrative arc of redemption it gives Don Jon an entirely welcome and unexpectedly heartfelt ending. MORE Qamp;A with Julianne Moore Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

So does Jon. So you would think theirs would be a match made in heaven or at least in Hollywood. Except that Barbaras favorite films are big studio romances. And Jon watches hardcore internet porn. Uh-oh. Their bumpy relationship is at the smart center of ""Don Jon"" an impressive first feature from the wry Joseph Gordon-Levitt who directed wrote and stars as a Jersey lothario. A believer in the trinity of gym/tan/laundry (""Jersey Shore"" was clearly a guilty inspiration) the hair-gelled Jon is still very much a regular old-fashioned how-YOU-doin guy who were this the 70s would be in a white suit tearing up the local discos. Unlike Tony of ""Saturday Night Fever"" Jon doesnt still live at home. But he sits next to his family at church comes back for Sunday dinner and stays true to the neighborhood (although in this case its a mix of real-life Hackensack and well-disguised L.A.). Yet although Jon hits the clubs with his crew - and never goes home alone - theres a problem. None of the women he meets not even the ""10s"" -- or ""dimes"" in his buddies parlance -- can compare with the pornography waiting for him on his laptop. Until he meets Barbara. It helps of course that shes played by Scarlett Johansson who does her best Jersey Girl impression right down to the tight jeans and heels (the hair could be bigger though). You can see why Jon would try to give up his porn addiction for this woman -- and you can see just how ruthless a grip it has on him when he cant. But ""Don Jon"" is a comedy not a 12-step drama. And its a pretty intelligent one too. Because Gordon-Levitts script gets its pained smiles not just from Jon but from Barbara too. His fantasy life may be sleazier and easier to make fun of. But her daydreams are twisted as well and have made her just as reluctant to accept Jon as who he is when with just a little pushing he could be ya know like so much better. Gordon-Levitts direction is both assured and fun using repetition (the same angles as Jon hits the clubs the same reaction shots of him later watching porn the same dialog as he makes his weekly confession to the priest) to underline his habits. And he gets great performances from his actors including a surprising Tony Danza as Jons dad. The only time the film falters seriously is when it introduces a new character in the person of Julianne Moore a free spirit whom Jon meets at a night-school class and who ends up offering a much more mature view of relationships than he was used to. Moore is terrific (and to its credit the film doesnt make a huge deal about the age difference). But she and the character are so good you want to see more of her. Theres suddenly a sense that the movie is hurrying to wrap up everything within some magic hour-and-a-half and as a result Moores role is shortchanged and the ending feels abrupt. Really ""Don Jon"" could have -- should have -- gone on another 20 minutes. Then again when was the last time you felt that about a romantic comedy? Or any movie? That ""Don Jon"" even disappoints a little at the end is a sign of how much it promises from the beginning. And how much potential its filmmaker clearly has. Ratings note The film contains graphic sexual situations nudity strong language and drug use. Don Jon (R) Relativity (90 min.) Directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt.

"Don Jon (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Don Jon (R) Joseph Gordon-Levitts directorial debut is an edgy comedy about a porn addict trying to get clean. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/26/2013 Editor rating 3 There are only a few things in life the New Jersey gym rat/bartender Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) truly cares about His body his ride his pad his family his friends and his porn. Man does he love his porn. Even though the handsome Jon never goes home alone after a night of clubhopping and even though he never settles for a woman that doesnt rank at least an 8 on his tough scale the act of sex doesnt fulfill him. Every time his latest random hook-up has passed out in his bed he sneaks away to his laptop for a nightcap. ""Nothing else does it for me in the same way"" Jon tells us. Visual stimulation is more satisfying than the real thing. And he cant get enough. Then he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) a perfect 10 with the sass and attitude to match. Except Barbara doesnt sleep around. She forces Jon to play the long game -- court her date her take her to see romantic comedies starring Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway. Barbara has a giant poster of Titanic hanging in her apartment. Her take on relationships is just as warped as Jons except hers is shaped by happily-ever-after fairy tales and the belief that a man should do everything for his woman. She also doesnt think sex is something to be treated lightly. ""Dont you think its always better when it means something?"" she asks the flummoxed Jon. Don Jon was written and directed by Gordon-Levitt who subverts traditional rom-com formulas with humor and an uncommonly frank depiction of a mans skewed psyche. The movie argues that contemporary media -- be it magazines movies TV ads or the Internet -- have made us all more isolated and self-centered than ever. When Jon starts going to night school at a community college and befriends an emotionally troubled but blunt woman (Julianne Moore) he is repelled by her honesty He recoils from her looking at her as if she were crazy because she doesnt hide under a facade pretending to be something shes not. Jon feels much more comfortable at home where his raucous Italian family (Tony Danza and Glenne Headley play his parents and Brie Larson is his texting-obsessed sister) talk and argue at the dinner table but no one is really paying attention to anyone else. Although the characters could have easily become guido stereotypes -- Danza is particularly good as Jons meathead dad -- Gordon-Levitt makes sure we can always see the human beings inside. Carefully written and edited so every one of its 90 minutes counts Don Jon is peppered with small seemingly throwaway scenes that pack an unexpected wallop. When Jon tells Barbara he needs to buy some Swiffers because hes run out she chastises him for cleaning his own apartment and tells him he should hire someone -- a woman -- to do that for him. She emasculates and humiliates him without even realizing it. The movie has a keen understanding of how easily we can hurt other people by not considering them. Despite its subject matter Don Jon has surprisingly little nudity (Jon and Barbara are fully clothed the first time they have sex). The movie only shows us snippets of the online videos and images that have consumed Jons life and have made him keep track of the number of times he can erupt in one day (his personal best is 10). Don Jon is nominally a love triangle between a woman a man and his laptop but the movie is much more thoughtful and substantial than that and it takes a compassionate and humane approach to all of its characters even when theyre at their most despicable. Don Jon implores us to look past the surfaces of our increasingly fetishized artificial social media-driven culture. Like Jon gradually learns real people are always more interesting messy flaws and all.

"Review Joseph Gordon-Levitts Don Jon is a smart R-rated comedy - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Joseph Gordon-Levitts Don Jon is a smart R-rated comedy By Christy Khoshaba (By Christy Khoshaba) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Who would have thought one of the most amusing and oddly insightful romantic comedies would be built around the power and the potent pull of porn?Playing it straight out of New Jersey that sweet-faced Joseph Gordon-Levitt the hopeless romantic of ""(500) Days of Summer"" has pulled off the subversive seductive fun of ""Don Jon"" in fine fashion -- complete with guinea tee -- starring in writing and directing his first feature film. ""The Don"" or ""Don Jon"" is one Jon Martello Jr. a proudly single guy of Italian heritage whose ability to one-night-stand the most attractive female in the bar on any given night has made him a living legend. Bada-boom.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie club Scarlett Johansson plays his perfect opposite number. Barbara Sugarmans a gum-smacking beauty determined to ""sophisticate"" her life turn that blue collar white on any potential mate. Julianne Moore is the films X-factor -- what she brings you wont see coming. Tony Danzas ranting dad Jon Sr. is such a meatball -- both consuming them and that ever-present plate of spaghetti with remarkable gusto and embodying that very specific male type -- that Im really hoping Hollywood is reminded of what a swell tough Danza can be.Much of ""Don Jons"" likability is because of its unapologetic frankness. Case in point The film opens with Jon pointing out all the things he loves in his life -- and Jon really loves his porn. He practices daily and religiously. Be forewarned on this front ""Don Jon"" represents. The imagery is bodacious bountiful and graphic.So how did a movie about porn turn into a clever romantic comedy and gulp manage to be so meaningful?PHOTOS Hollywood backlot moments Certainly a great deal of credit goes to Gordon-Levitt for his shrewd take on the topic. But it feels as if something larger is afoot. With films like ""Don Jon"" and earlier this summer the caustic apocalyptic pop of ""This Is the End"" perhaps R-rated comedy is moving past its mindless ""Hangover"" phase.""Don Jon"" is definitely smarter than your average R. Its as if the 32-year-old actor has taken everything hes learned -- working with directors as diverse as big-vision Christopher Nolan and artful-indie Jonathan Levine and roles as distinct as the time-traveling hitman in ""Looper"" and his love-struck cancer patient in ""50/50"" -- and rolled the collective wisdom into ""Don Jon.""As a result Jon is no one-dimensional dude. Sure he may be addicted to porn but hes seriously devoted to his boys Bobby (Rob Brown) and Danny (Jeremy Luke) and his family silent-texting sister Monica (Brie Larson milking the dialogue shes given) dad and a slightly hysterical mom (Glenne Headly).There is his body too gym-toned to perfection; his wheels a vintage Chevy Chevelle SS; and his church Catholic to which he is faithful. Every Sunday hes there with the family followed by confession -- his primary sins masturbation and sex out of wedlock. A few Hail Marys a clean slate and Jon is set for the week ahead.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesUntil the night Barbara shows up at the bar. She might be ""the one"" and the nagging sense that Jon may actually want something more than sex sets up the major axis on which the film turns.On the surface much of the humor is derived from baser instincts. The way Jon describes his dedication to porn is remarkably scientific and with a precision Masters and Johnson could only dream about. You do begin to understand what watching does for him and why he finds it more satisfying than the real thing though lord knows he has plenty of that too.But in using porn as Jons touchstone and the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet ""Titanic"" affair as Barbaras Gordon-Levitt has zeroed in on the central friction of media-enhanced romantic expectations. Johansson is excellent in taking Barbara from tease to torturer wielding her sexuality like a club. The couples clashing ideals come into sharp focus during a heated argument over the merits of Swiffer. Yes a mop makes a major mess. The humor tempered by hurt is classic.SNEAKS Movie trailers full coverage      The movie never forgets that relationships are messy too. Moore turns up as Ester an unconventional complication. Jon first spots the sobbing woman at his night class and steers clear. When she wanders over to apologize and catches him watching porn on his cell Jons world view shifts again.Gordon-Levitt peels back yet another layer of gender politics in their relationship. There is the age difference and there is the sex. But it is in bridging the intellectual divide between them that the film gets interesting. The acting is fine all around but Gordon-Levitt is the anchor wearing that Jersey accent like he was born with it. The crew from camera to set design does its work to keep that vibe going. It suits one of the films smart secondary themes particularly well that of the working class. Watching Jon behind the wheel of his souped-up Chevy shouting F-bombs at the idiots on the road then seeing Jon Sr. hurling the same epithets at the idiots on TV you see the traditions that bind father and son.And if the plotting and the romancing in ""Don Jon"" goes slightly soft at the end cant we forgive a guy a little sentimentality?

Credit Daniel McFadden In theaters Friday Sept. 27. 3 1/2 stars (out of 4) Weve all met him. Hes that smooth-talking bicep-displaying oiled-up dude at the club who targets beauties with a laser-beam focus -- then promptly dumps them. In this edgy and smart comedy his name is Jon (Joseph Gordon-Levitt also the writer and director) and hes so disposable with women that his buddies nickname him after the infamous lothario. PHOTOS Oscars All the Hottest Afterparties But ""Don Jon"" has an addiction you see. Hes obsessed with porn. He watches it on his laptop up to 11 times a day and its as ritualistic to him as brushing his teeth and vacuuming his immaculate apartment. To Jon the perfect girls in his racy videos provide an instant gateway to happiness. Then he meets well-manicured Jersey girl Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson). Shes a ""dime"" (thats guido-speak for 10) and believes in old-fashioned movie romance. After she agrees to go out with him -- on the one condition that he must never lie to her -- Jon tries to curb his objectifying behavior and XXX-rated habits. Tries to anyway. PHOTOS Oscars 2013 Best Picture Nominees GTL comparisons aside Jons sublime journey extends well past the shenanigans along Jersey Shores old boardwalk. Gordon-Levitt gives Jon an empathetic warmth and charm whether hes belting out Marky Marks ""Good Vibrations"" in his car on the way to church or yakking it up at dinner with his close-knit Italian family. (The casting of Tony Danza as Jons dad is a nice touch. Its as if Samantha Micelli herself could be sitting at the dinner table with this boisterous bunch). The ever-voluptuous Johansson also gets a rare chance to show off her gum-snapping comedic side. PHOTOS 2013 Tony Awards What the Stars Wore In his directing debut Gordon-Levitt hones the film with a self-assured hand. For Jon and Barbaras bumpy romance the scenes are snappy instead of soapy. (The tenderness comes later when Jon finally learns what it takes to woo a member of the opposite sex). And the porn? It flashes on screen in quick-cut montages illustrating Jons insatiable need to see it -- and its damaging effect on his psyche.

AP Daniel McFadden AP Relativity Media AP AP AP Don Jon Director Joseph Gordon-Levitt Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Scarlett Johansson Julianne Moore Rated R (strong graphic sexual material and dialogue throughout nudity strong language drug use) Running time 90 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1115pm on Thursday Sep. 26 2013 Thursday Sep. 26 2013 Thursday Sep. 26 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Don Jons a dog.He only cares about his car his pad his boys his family his gym his church (Sundays only) girls and porn -- lots and lots of porn. That is until he meets Ms. Right -- actually two Ms. Rights -- and his bro-licious world is turned upside down when he learns that women are people too.Thats the simple premise for Don Jon the feature directorial/writing debut for actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt but its handled with such a deft sense of humor and pathos that it transcends any rom-com handcuffs anyone might try to slap on it. Like 50/50 the 2011 film in which Gordon-Levitt starred as a young guy who discovers he has cancer but still needs to live his life Don Jon takes what in other hands could have been awkward or mawkish and makes it relatable. Gordon-Levitt plays Jon a working-class Jersey guy cruising through life. That is until Barbara Sugarman (an entertaining Scarlett Johansson doing her best future Real Housewives of New Jersey imitation) high-heels her way into his heart. Hes totally smitten but the one thing that stands between them and relationship bliss is his porn addiction.It takes a bit of schooling from an older woman he meets at night school (Julianne Moore) whos dealing with lots of issues of her own to get him to try to face his problems of treating women like objects.Sure its an obvious point and one thats not new. Several recent films have dealt with the delicate subject of porn addiction and the dehumanization that stems from it. The powerful Shame did it in a much grimmer darker fashion two years ago while the breezy lightweight Thanks for Sharing in theaters now treads some of the same territory.But Gordon-Levitt enlivens Don Jon with such a sense of swagger as a director writer and actor that the film feels fresh. He gets strong performances from his actors including Tony Danza as his no-nonsense dad and especially Moore as the complicated conflicted Esther. The suddenly omnipresent Brie Larson ( Short Term 12 The Spectacular Now) has a small but funny part as Jons sister.To top it off theres no way anyones leaving the theater without Marky Marks 1991 hit Good Vibrations dancing in their head. Everybody wins. Cary Darling 817 390-7571; Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Relativity Media hide caption toggle caption Relativity Media Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- in his writing and directing debut -- plays Jon a porn addict with no interest in relationships until Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) changes things. Relativity Media Don Jon Director Joseph Gordon-Levitt Genre Romantic Comedy Running Time 90 minutes Rated R for strong graphic sexual material and dialogue throughout nudity language and some drug use With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Scarlett Johansson Julianne Moore Tony Danza Once a child actor on TV then an indie sensation then an honest-to-God movie star going head-to-head with the likes of Bruce Willis in Looper and Leo DiCaprio in Inception Joseph Gordon-Levitt hardly needs to burnish his LinkedIn resume at this point. But thats not kept him from adding a couple of skills -- writing and directing -- with his latest picture. In the romantic comedy Don Jon about a modern-day Lothario at large in New Jersey -- he plays Jon Martello a guy whod be the first to tell you he has life all figured out. Which should probably tell you something else Hes not a deep thinker. In voice-over at the top of the movie Jon lists the things he really cares about his body his apartment his Camaro his family his church his pals his gals and his porn. That last lets note is not an admission that strikes Jon as particularly odd. His New Jersey buddies have nicknamed him Don Jon because hes a real Don Juan with the ladies -- a fresh conquest every night lots to confess at confession. But after sex hes kinda done with the encounter while his conquests generally want to cuddle. And though he pays lip service to the notion that he might want that too should the right girl ever come along all that pornography offers sex without cuddling. Which truth be told he prefers. Then the right girl does in fact come along Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) whos blond stacked altogether babealicious -- a perfect 10 in the eyes of his buddies and to Jons consternation as adept at playing the seduction game as he is. i Wonder where he gets that Gordon-Levitts Jon looking a lot like a chip off the old block (Tony Danza). Relativity Media hide caption toggle caption Relativity Media Wonder where he gets that Gordon-Levitts Jon looking a lot like a chip off the old block (Tony Danza). Relativity Media Barbara wont go to bed with him after one date or even after one month. She insists on meeting his parents (Tony Danza and Glenne Headley both hilarious) and gets him to take night classes so he can better his bartending job. And to his horror she wants him to do couples stuff like going to romantic movies (Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway riotously coupled in a quick chick-flick parody). But Jon of course likes a different sort of movie and once hes finally sealed the deal and he and Barbara are more or less living together he returns to old habits -- whereupon she catches him surfing the Web for porn. These two are playing at adult relationships but theyre not terribly grown-up and that it turns out is central to what Gordon-Levitt the filmmaker wants to explore here. And hes clearly been paying attention to more than his own lines as hes transitioned from TV to indie dramas to big-studio blockbusters. Don Jon qualifies as an authoritative writing and directing debut -- smooth funny and with a terrific cast -- not just Johansson vamping in that thick New Jersey accent but Headley and Danza Brie Larson as a little sister who barely looks up from her cellphone but somehow takes in everything and Julianne Moore fragile and slyly funny as the one thoughtful adult among all these cartoonish types. Gordon-Levitt keeps things riotous for the films first hour and if he eases into an ending thats a little Hollywood-standard after having so much fun tweaking form and content Im guessing audiences will cut him some slack. Just as Don Jon is learning the ropes after all so is the guy who dreamed him up.

Nor should the fact that its written and directed by its star Joseph Gordon-Levitt the most adorable leading man of his generation. The movies not exactly ""(500) Days of Foreplay"" but neither is it an earnest lecture like the recent ""Thanks for Sharing."" (Nor is it a horizontal ""Saturday Night Fever"" despite the often-forced ""Jersey Shore"" cliches.) What ""Don Jon"" is surprisingly is honest.

Fox Searchlight By Joe Morgenstern Updated Sept. 26 2013 305 p.m. ET I cant say enough about the way ""Enough Said"" keeps its scintillating sense of humor as it grows deeper and more affecting. Nicole Holofceners romantic comedy in national release beginning this weekend stars Julia Louis-Dreyfus and James Gandolfini as Eva and Albert middle-age divorcees with kids who chance to meet when theyre both facing the prospect of empty nests and emptier lives. At first the storys tone suggests cheerful sitcom; these two ostensible adults conduct their courtship with all the suave sophistication of middle-schoolers. Yet the undertones have undertones in this beautiful movie which drills into layers of loneliness neediness and self-doubt. The setup is beguilingly simple. Eva a masseuse is falling in love with the charmingly eccentric Albert who runs a small television-history archive. At the same time shes hearing horror stories from a pop-poet client about the clients ex-husband. (The poet Marianne is played to narcissistic perfection by Catherine Keener.) Eventually Eva realizes what we may already have guessed or know from the trailer--that the man Marianne abhors is the same one Eva adores. Who then is this Albert person? Is he Mister Right-Despite-Some-Quirks or Mister Couldnt-Be-Wronger? Marianne is too prejudiced to be a credible reporter but Eva is too insecure to credit the evidence of her heart. Watch a clip from the film ""Enough Said."" A divorced woman who decides to pursue the man shes interested in learns hes her new friends ex-husband. Starring James Gandolfini Toni Collette and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. (Photo/Video Fox Searchlight) ""Enough Said"" stakes a claim on our hearts before the first frame lights up the screen; its the next-to-last film Mr. Gandolfini made before he died. To make matters simultaneously worse (for our sense of loss) and better (for the film) his performance is marvelous--centered relaxed and so grounded in genial humanity that we quickly switch from watching a beloved actor who has left us to rooting for a character who deserves the best life can give him. Ms. Louis-Dreyfus is equally endearing and this is ultimately Evas film since shes the one stuck in a sort of amatory ""Rashomon""; its painfully funny to watch her figure out which version of Albert is closer to the truth. Pain is a significant part of ""Enough Said"" while funny is the films mode at almost any given moment. Just as Ms. Holofcener did three years ago in ""Please Give"" she has packed a small world of intriguing people into a short running time--this one is three minutes longer than the previous one which clocked in at 90 minutes on the button--and shes given every one of them lovely lines to toss off as grace notes. (After conducting an anxious search of Alberts bathroom for clues to his personality Eva asks him why he has so many toothbrushes. ""I dont know"" he replies amused and slightly defensive ""theyre my friends."") The excellent cast includes Tracey Fairaway as Evas daughter Ellen; Tavi Gevenson as Ellens friend Chloe; and Toni Collette and Ben Falcone as Sarah and Will a couple struggling with two relationships at the same time--their own and the one with their fractious housekeeper. WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern cant say enough about the way ""Enough Said"" keeps its sense of humor as it grows deeper and more affecting. He joins Lunch Break with a review of the film which is the next-to-last film James Gandolfini made before he died. (Photo Fox Searchlight Pictures) But oh the pain of it all for Eva and Albert. Some of it is situational and more or less general--the yearning for intimacy; the perplexity of sex; the mystery of personality at any age but especially in middle-age when new relationships may seem as impossible as they are desirable. Much of it though is specific to the conflicts and doubts that hold the heroine in thrall. If love is blind conflicted love is deaf and dumb. Eva is so needy that she projects her neediness on the blithely manipulative Marianne who will never lack for company. She keeps listening to Mariannes stories about Albert even though theyre poisoning her relationship with the man she thinks she loves. Yet the most potent poison of the piece is fear--Evas fear of growing old (she jokes about knitting but continues to knit); of being alone of not knowing enough or feeling clearly enough to trust herself with her own precious fate. She cant find the words to express the depths of her fear; thats understandable. Yet the movie expresses it for her and entirely in the language of romantic comedy. Thats remarkable. Inequality for All Watch a clip from film ""Inequality for All"" a documentary that follows former U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich as he looks to raise awareness of the countrys widening economic gap. (Photo/Video RADiUS-TWC) Jacob Kornbluths lively documentary is both a polemic and a teaching tool. Its based on ""Aftershock"" a book first published in 2010 by Robert B. Reich. Mr. Reich was most notably labor secretary under Bill Clinton and is currently a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley. As the films instructor-host talking straight to the camera or in a lecture-hall setting hes consistently engaging and occasionally passionate about the widening gap between Americas rich and poor. (The template here clearly derives from Al Gores ""An Inconvenient Truth."") As the films star hes extremely personable as well as winningly self-ironic and not only about his short stature which he addresses with a sprinkling of polished jokes. Looking back on those Clinton years he asserts that ""we didnt do enough we didnt really alter the underlying trend"" of income inequality and faults himself for growing predictable on the subject ""I became a true pain in the ass. People would roll their eyes."" ENLARGE Robert Reich RADiUS-TWC For those conversant with his views predictable may seem an understatement. Mr. Reich uses his platform to argue as he has been doing over years and decades for tighter regulation of the financial sector and with Warren Buffett showing up in support for higher taxes on the rich. ""We need to replace trickle-down economics with middle-out economics"" he contends. ""The most pro-business thing you can do is help middle-class people thrive."" For wider audiences though Mr. Kornbluths documentary argues eloquently for such unassailable goals as investment in education and infrastructure and complements Mr. Reichs exposition with compelling interviews of middle-class Americans who dont understand whats happening to them. ""How can we not have money?"" asks one young woman who with her family lives hand-to-mouth even though shes got a regular job. And with less of a political charge than its hosts presence might suggest the film puts whats been happening--the housing bubble the 2008 crash soaring health costs stagnant salaries the parallel emergence of the Tea Party and Occupy movements (""Youve got a lot of people who feel the game is stacked against them"")--in the context of a globalized economy and a host of technological revolutions that offer hope along with frightening dislocation. ""Im still a cockeyed optimist"" Mr. Reich says. ""Thats why I teach."" Don Jon Watch a clip from the film ""Don Jon."" A New Jersey guy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) develops unrealistic expectations from watching porn and works to find happiness with his potential true love (Scarlett Johansson). (Photo/Video Relativity Media) ""You like movies?"" an alluring Scarlett Johansson asks in a startlingly effective TV spot for Joseph Gordon-Levitts debut as writer-director-star. (She asks it in the movie too.) Put me down as a definite yes. I not only like movies and Ms. Johansson but I like Mr. Gordon-Levitt a lot as an actor and I wish him only the best in his future work as a filmmaker. There is however the matter of this particular movie an overheated disquisition on the pleasures and limitations of masturbation. ENLARGE Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansson Relativity Media The script is shrewd enough in its attitude toward porn (addictive but empty calories) and its heros devotion to porn. (Unlike the original Don Juan Mr. Gordon-Levitts Jon a New Jersey guy dubbed Don Jon by his buddies would rather go it alone.) But the ethnic tropes and accents are almost as cringeworthy as Jons repetitive liaisons with his laptop computer. (Ms. Johanssons speech patterns are the delightful exception; who knew she could do Jersey with the casual aplomb of Streisand doing Brooklyn?) Enough gets to be enough long before the movie sets Jon on a journey that leads to Ms. Johanssons flesh-and-blood beauty Barbara and after some twists and turns to him finding mutuality in sex and love. Rewind Friends With Money (2006) ENLARGE Friends With Money Of the four women in Nicole Holofceners third feature film only Frances McDormands Jane is flamingly angry; shes the most vivid character in the group. Not that the others dont have interesting problems or that they arent played with panache Jennifer Aniston Catherine Keener and Joan Cusack could bring panache to a reading of the stock tables. The movie set on the affluent West Side of Los Angeles is a series of acute observations in search of drama while Jane a precariously married woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown is her own drama queen. Manufactured Landscapes (2006) ENLARGE Manufactured Landscapes Inspired by the work of the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky Jennifer Baichwals landmark documentary depicts some aspects of the human enterprise described by the term globalization. The film starts with an eight-minute tracking shot down one aisle of a Chinese factory the size of a small town. Then it follows Mr. Burtynsky on a tour of industrial Asia in order to show the scale of mans activities including Chinas Three Gorges Dam and the impact theyre having on our planet. I thought I had some sense of that impact until I saw this astonishing film. Looper (2012) ENLARGE Looper Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a young time-traveling assassin named Joe in Rian Johnsons remarkably elegant sci-fi adventure. The actor doesnt quite look like himself thanks to prosthetic adjustments of his familiar features though the explanation for that is soon apparent. And the character confronting himself in a mirror checks to see if his hairline is receding; its a nice little joke with the same explanation in the intricate story which is set mainly in 2044 and also features Bruce Willis. Dont worry about the plots logic just see the film next time you can.
