"The Prince of Egypt (PG) Related Item Go to Video Finder Prince of Egypt Tale of a Hero By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 18 1998 Moses leads the Hebrews out of Egypt in ""The Prince of Egypt."" (DreamWorks) Director Brenda Chapman; Steve Hickner Cast Sandra Bullock; Ralph Fiennes; Danny Glover; Jeff Goldblum; Val Kilmer; Steve Martin; Helen Mirren; Michelle Pfeiffer; Martin Short; Patrick Stewart Running Time 1 hour 39 minutes Contains powerful suggestions of the death of children as both state policy and the work of God Oscar Original Song (""When You Believe"") Is ""The Prince of Egypt"" a good movie or the most expensive Sunday school filmstrip ever made? My enthusiasm for Western man is so primal that I lean toward the former. Really so much of it begins with Moses the concept of freedom the sense of the worth of the individual the idea of God as an abstract ideal of morality instead of a batch of dog-faced bullies commandments one through ten even that inconvenient one about the neighbors wife and the coolness of beards. Oh and also Judaism and Christianity democracy and baseball to say nothing of Shakespeare Bogart and Faulkner. The new animated feature from Dreamworks SKG gets that. If nothing else its a wonderful essay on the meaning of freedom and the courage it takes to wrestle it from despots. In that sense it feels more political and cultural than religious. You dont see faith systems in opposition so much as idea systems. Primarily concerned with the first part of the Book of Exodus - you know the part with all the special effects - it leaves out that dreary 40 years in the wilderness and being aimed at families equally omits the shimmy-shim-sham danced about the feet of the Golden Calf. We begin by watching Baby Moses basket-surf the Nile to be rescued by an Egyptian princess. He is raised to privilege in the court as brother to the Pharaoh to be. Upon discovering his true Hebrew identity he suffers a crisis flees and returns with the best slogan ever written Let My People Go. When Pharaoh wont listen God sends bugs and frogs. The people are ultimately let go but then Pharaoh goes after them. Theres no revisionist carping about Red/Reed Sea translation confusion This is the big wet one baby and Moses parts it neatly as Elvis parted his first hairdo for Ed Sullivan. When Pharaoh and his boys clamber in their chariots across the same passageway only Charlie Tuna is around to listen to their complaints. The movies proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable more humanly knowable. This is not the time and the place to bedevil Charlton Heston who after all cant really help being Charlton Heston. But his famous 1956 movie Moses was a reflection of a time that invested most of its authority in the severe white male an unbending paragon of morality strength and wisdom. Watch the news for 7 or possibly as long as 11 seconds and see how far that one has fallen But this Moses voiced by the less than imperial Val Kilmer is less iconographic and more human. This Moses doesnt seem to be posing for Mount Rushmore and you could never ski down his cheekbones. Wiry and Semitic hes a man beset with doubts who feels himself completely unworthy. When he discovers his secret heritage he reacts more like Woody Allen than an NRA president He gets mopey depressed and self-loathing. He wants to be hugged. Without going too far into this matter it seems clear that this Moses reflects the personality of his creator Dreamworks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg. Possibly he represents a little of Katzenbergs more famous partner Steven Spielberg as well. Hestons Big Mo was a vision of the annoyingly Caesarean Cecil B. De Mille a bald tyrant who stomped around movie sets in jodhpurs and cavalry boots like some sort of Crimean War general about to order the light brigade to charge. He believed in the principle of absolute authority - his own - and he directed with the subtlety of a man carving an angel out of a lump of coal with a chisel. The second virtue to ""Prince of Egypt"" is a superb performance. Its amazing how a great actor can dominate a project without even showing his face. I refer not to Kilmer who is appropriately unassertive in the role nor to the absurd Valley Girl stylings of Michelle Pfeiffer as Tzipporah Moses wife. Hard to believe Moses wife went to Redondo Beach High School No the reigning vocal genius of ""Prince of Egypt"" is Ralph Fiennes as Rameses the non-blood brother of Moses upbringing inheritor of the throne. It is to the productions credit that hes given a motive - his fear of being the ""weak link"" in pharaonic succession of failing the empire of his fathers and his sons. But this Pharaoh like the Moses of his opposition is a man not a symbol and in Fienness reading we hear the tragedy of a king born out of time shackled to a set of beliefs that are crumbling daily still in tragic love with a brother who has outgrown him. In the fight of his life hes overmatched and he doesnt even know it Hes not going against Moses hes up against the Big Guy Himself. How do you fight plagues? How do you fight frogs in the billions? What about locusts - DDT is still 4000 years in the future. And that of course gets to the third triumph of this surprisingly short intense film. It really rides the possibilities of animation out to the limits. The design seems drawn from some of Gustave Dores scarier prints and the sense of both the monumental and the inspirational is well evoked. When God sends flames to light up the Egyptian night they glow with the incandescence of Hell on Earth. When the Red Sea parts it ascends to Heaven a great backlit wall of undulating light-diffusing water. Likewise the Egyptian architecture has been cleverly created to carry a message. Its geometric mass and density almost beyond human measure aptly invoke a world with many followers and but one leader who in his own mind thought he was beyond human and nearly a god himself. Its the architecture of human delusion grandly evil in its assumption of the rulers right to command the totality of social obedience. Raise a man in monstrous buildings and he becomes a monster. So it is with Pharaoh. By contrast Moses shorn of the grandeur of architecture that assails Heaven glimpses man on the horizon and something above. He becomes more human humbled doubting pathetic and given his persistence in the face of those doubts truly heroic. Thats what ""The Prince of Egypt"" finally is a heros biography.

Comments The Prince of Egypt Fewer grandiloquent songs describing the characters dilemmas in rhyme and a more ambivalent hero might have improved this 1998 animated musical which credits as its source the Book of Exodus. But the blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent. For a cartoon epic designed for broad appeal this contains surprisingly few simpering or wide-eyed characters and its representation of the politics of slavery is unusually complex.

With the voices of Val Kilmer Ralph Fiennes Sandra Bullock Danny Glover Jeff Goldblum Steve Martin Helen Mirren Michelle Pfeiffer Martin Short Patrick Stewart. Songs by Stephen Schwartz. Directed by Brenda Chapman Steve Hickner and Simon Wells. (PG. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With only a few apologies to Exodus and Deuteronomy ""The Prince of Egypt"" is an inspiring translation of biblical grandeur turning the story of one of historys greatest heroes into an entertaining visually dazzling cartoon. The new animated film from DreamWorks featuring the voices of Val Kilmer Ralph Fiennes Sandra Bullock Danny Glover Jeff Goldblum Steve Martin Helen Mirren Michelle Pfeiffer Martin Short and Patrick Stewart opens today in Bay Area theaters. ""The Prince of Egypt"" takes real chances with a character study issues of slavery and ideas of faith that put the animated film on a high plane. But the movie is also a skillful interweaving of comedy and a handful of pop-style songs with hummable spirit-inspired refrains. The animators clearly took some cues from Cecil B. DeMilles stunning and corny 1956 epic ""The Ten Commandments"" that recounts the story of Moses leading the Jews exodus from Egypt. At first glance Moses and his ancient scene seem sure-fire Hollywood fodder. But if you think about the man many consider the Bibles greatest hero youll realize that fervent faith lies at the core of his story. And it had to be daunting to try to capture the sizzle of that faith in a cartoon. Yet ""The Prince of Egypt"" takes a mighty stab at it. And the result is a satisfying ultimately moving study of an ordinary man whose obedience to God was to echo through history. The key here is that Moses (Val Kilmer) is portrayed as a mere mortal a man whose extraordinary resolve is born of his sudden realization of injustice. This is no sanctimonious picture of Moses who wrestles with moral awakening and battles self-doubt. The tale begins with the baby Moses set adrift on the Nile by his Jewish mother Yocheved (Israeli singer Ofra Haza) to spare him from slavery or death. Hes nearly drowned by waves and fishing craft but is rescued by the Pharaohs Queen (Mirren) who adopts him as a son. Raised with a rambunctious adopted brother Rameses (Fiennes) Moses lives a happy-go-lucky royal life. As teens the boys are full of vinegar charging at breakneck speeds in their chariots while all around them the Hebrew slaves do endless toil under the ruthless Pharaoh Seti (Stewart). It isnt long before Moses sees the dark side to this paradise. Rameses is appointed regent and honors Moses with a Jewish slave as a concubine. But the hero lets the feisty young woman Tzipporah (Pfeiffer) -- later to become his wife -- escape. He follows her to a Hebrew neighborhood and encounters his blood sister Miriam (Bullock) and his future father-in-law Jethro (Glover). But he has no idea that he is one of their tribe. It isnt until his famed intercession in the flogging of an elderly slave that Moses begins to understand his arduous destiny. ""The Prince of Egypt"" takes up the story in extraordinary shadings for an animated film (in several sequences new animation techniques give it a 3-D look). In some of the most stunning moments grand- scale montages advance the story. Among the most striking is a plague sequence in which God unleashes his wrath upon the Egyptians. Its dark tumultuous breathtaking. The depiction of the parting of the Red Sea is outstanding as well showing the Jews miraculous escape shaded by near-doom. Some viewers may see the film as unusually dark or overwrought with action (a swirling magical sequence in which Rameses conjurers try to outdo Moses magical staff is pretty intense). But a PG rating seems appropriate -- the Bible aint exactly a barrel of laughs. Yet the film is also surprisingly fun owing mostly to a handful of songs by Stephen Schwartz (""Pocahontas"") tuneful pieces that give the saga a Broadway-show mood. Songs include a Hebrew freedom cry titled ""Deliver Us""; a touching Moses solo ""All I Ever Wanted""; a philosophical croon by Jethro ""Through Heavens Eyes""; and a high-energy comic production number that seems all-Hollywood -- ""Playing With the Big Boys"" sung by Rameses court magicians Hotep (Martin) and Huy (Short).

Far more than a cartoon rendering of a much-beloved Bible story DreamWorks four-years-in-the-making ""The Prince of Egypt"" proves an outstanding artistic achievement that along with the studios ""Antz"" further ups the ante in high-stakes feature animation. At once rich in historic and character detail and full of eye-popping tableaux this new spin on the Moses saga sometimes out-DeMilles DeMilles 1956 live-action epic ""The Ten Commandments."" Alas the PG-rated pics appropriately dour tone and admirable refusal to play down to little ones with farcical time-outs -- no talking camels or Sphinx-like Siamese if you please -- will hobble it at the box office. Discerning adults who dont do animation solo would appear to be target audience for a film that will be more admired than enjoyed. B.O. promised land will be deferred until cable and TV playdates when the storys timeless appeal will translate into perennial holiday bookings as well as video. An oft-described labor of love for DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg who at Disney helped marshal ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"" this loose adaptation of the Moses saga in the Book of Exodus plays like an abbreviated considerably less vulgar version of the story DeMille filmed twice. To head off criticism from scholars for license taken (baby Moses is now rescued by Pharaohs wife not daughter; Moses back from exile now resembles a goateed rocker rather than an ancient prophet) ""Prince"" opens with disclaimer that all to follow is true to the ""essence and values"" of the Bible story. Clearly changes were made by scenarist Philip LaZebnik and helmers Brenda Chapman Steve Hickner and Simon Wells to make the tale more palatable to teens. With Rameses (voiced by Ralph Fiennes) and Moses (Val Kilmer who doubles for a Dolby-surround deity) rewritten as hellion stepbrothers pic shrewdly milks filial love-gone-sour aspects found in the Joseph and Cain-and-Abel parables. A seamless combination of traditional animation and state-of-the-art CGI with Semitic-flavored score by Hans Zimmer (""The Lion King"") and original songs by Stephen Schwartz (""Pocahontas"") pic opens masterfully with an audacious eight-minute musical prologue establishing both the majesty and ruthlessness of ancient Egypt. Moses per every retelling is saved from Pharaohs forces by his mother who launches him down the Nile. New version relies on conventional cliffhanger moments with Moses the newborn narrowly surviving river hippos and crocs and the teenage Moses and Rameses drag-racing chariots and lobbing ancient versions of water balloons. The chariot race up a monuments switchback scaffolding is as silly as it is ambitious. Central conflicts emerge as Pharaoh (Patrick Stewart) reminds Rameses of his duties as divine successor and Moses after a chance meeting with his slave sister Miriam (Sandra Bullock) begins to question his own lineage. The truth about his past -and Pharaohs genocidal campaign against the Israelites -- emerges via a brilliantly conceived dream sequence in which hieroglyphic wall paintings come to life in a mix of 2-D and 3-D animation. The burning bush encounter and parting of the Red Sea -- showstoppers in DeMilles roadshow -- dont disappoint here either. Visually both moments are at once reminiscent of the live-action versions matte paintings and thanks to 3-D imaging a marked improvement. Even more impressive is the plague-and-pestilence sequence which unfolds eerily in monochromatic grays as a ghoulish coil snuffs the life from Egypts first born. Grim and all-too-believable the sequence can take its place beside ""Fantasias"" ""Night on Bald Mountain"" as one of the scariest moments to find its way into family animation. In the best tradition of biblical epics this one boasts a ""cast of thousands"" here digitally drawn and rendered in close-up as well as overhead during the grand-scale exodus. Dramatically the filmmakers sidestep focus problems by concentrating on only a handful of principals. Of the voice talents employed Fiennes as the confused and embittered Rameses Jeff Goldblum as Moses older brother Aaron and Danny Glover as the high priest of Midian bring the most dimension to their characters. Kilmer makes a rather lackluster Moses but manages just the right mix of impatience and pique as The Voice. Steve Martin and Martin Short leave little impression comic or otherwise as the Pharaohs constantly upstaged magicians while Michelle Pfeiffer as a strong-willed shepherdess who eventually marries Moses suffers from the storys ambivalent take on biblical sex. Of the nine new songs -- seven interwoven into the plot two over end credits -- only the opening ""Deliver Us"" (performed by Ofra Haza and Eden Riegel) the contrapuntal ""The Plagues"" (Fiennes and Moses singing voice Amick Byram) and the inspirational ""I Will Get There"" (Boyz II Men) have lasting appeal. Martin and Shorts ""Playing With the Big Boys"" would be right at home on a Vegas stage. The gushy heavily hyped Whitney Houston-Mariah Carey duet ""When You Believe"" sounds like something recycled from ""Pocahontas."" At 97 minutes pic is longer than most animated features but darn-near brisk next to DeMilles nearly four-hour extravaganza. Appropriately story ends with Moses delivering commandments just short of DeMilles golden-calf orgy. Overall material is treated with reverence and restraint leaving one to question the PG rating especially when Universals much darker ""Babe 2 Pig in the City"" carries a G.

"The Prince of Egypt (PG) Related Item ""The Prince of Egypt"" showtimes High Fidelity From Prince By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 18 1998 Moses leads the Hebrews out of Egypt in ""The Prince of Egypt."" (DreamWorks) Director Brenda Chapman; Steve Hickner Cast Sandra Bullock; Ralph Fiennes; Danny Glover; Jeff Goldblum; Val Kilmer; Steve Martin; Helen Mirren; Michelle Pfeiffer; Martin Short; Patrick Stewart Running Time 1 hour 39 minutes Contains intense but generally bloodless biblical scenes including a pillar of fire plagues pestilence slavery whipping murder infanticide and the corpse of a young boy Oscar Original Song (""When You Believe"") ""The Prince of Egypt"" opens with dramatic clouds and portentous chords. As gaunt Hebrew slaves bend to the task of toting several-ton construction stones up the steps of the pyramids the lash of their Egyptian overlords stings the flesh on their backs. Lyrics to the charming work-song they intone go something like this ""Whip on my shoulder sweat on my brow."" (""Heigh-ho heigh-ho its off to work we go"" this aint.) True to the Exodus-inspired origins of this tale of Moses DreamWorks Pictures ""The Prince of Egypt"" is no walk in the park. The disturbingly grown-up animated film version of the biblical story of bondage and release is dark more than a bit morbid and boasts a God with a rumbling basso-profundo voice like Darth Vaders. God may be Love in the New Testament but this Old Testament divinity you dont want to mess with lest he smite ye with the full force of his wrath. All of which begs the question Whom is this picture intended for? Its one thing to hear Bible stories in Sunday school quite another to see a river of crimson blood and a ghostly death-cloud that picks off kids like cockroaches illustrated in lavish color. The story is a great one - after all as an on-screen title points out its the basis of faith for millions of people around the world. But the idea of making a cartoon out of such a heavy drama is frankly strange. As the epic begins we see a cute-as-a-button Cabbage-Patch Moses hidden in a basket and placed in the river by his Hebrew mother Yocheved (the voice of Ofra Haza) in order to save his life from murderous Egyptian soldiers. Next thing you know the baby is floating down a white-water rapid narrowly escaping the snapping jaws of crocodiles. Finally he comes to rest by the palace of the Pharaoh Seti (Patrick Stewart) where he is raised to adulthood along with the Pharaohs son Rameses (Ralph Fiennes). Although he is treated like a prince the now beef-cakey Moses (Val Kilmer) comes to suspect that he doesnt belong with the royals after a chance street encounter with his long-lost brother and sister Aaron and Miriam (Jeff Goldblum and Sandra Bullock). Following a vision - wherein bas-relief stone carvings stunningly come to life and animate the history of his oppressed people - he resolves to renounce his life of privilege for the privations of the desert. While in self-imposed exile Moses falls in love with the sexy Midianite shepherdess Tzipporah (Michelle Pfeiffer) and marries her. The infamous burning bush soon materializes to tell him to go back and free his people. Aided in his argument by a barrage of very persuasive plagues including slimy frogs destructive locusts and rather gruesome open sores Moses struggles to convince the new Pharaoh Rameses of his very simple demand ""Let my people go."" Of course some artistic license has been taken with the source material but overall ""The Prince of Egypt"" is remarkably faithful to the Bible so much so that that fidelity is both to its credit and its detriment. Having taken pains to treat the biblical account of Moses with gravity DreamWorks is to be commended for avoiding frivolity. Still the yarn is a complicated one - not to mention scary - and many younger children will undoubtedly be confused by its plot intricacies and frightened by its numerous scenes of pain and suffering. Grown up folks and kids with stronger stomachs on the other hand should enjoy the high drama and rich suspense although those expecting a little comic relief from Steve Martin and Martin Short as temple magicians Hotep and Huy will be disappointed. Their show-stopping musical number ""Playing With the Big Boys"" in which the Egyptian gods show off their miracles is the best of the songs by Stephen Schwartz but its not exactly what you would call funny. At other times the bombastic but less memorable score can overwhelm both dialogue and lyrics. As a rule the drawn and computer-animated imagery is top notch and seamlessly integrated but the central characters tawny complexions and the often chiaroscuro lighting sometimes obscure all but the whites of their eyes and their pearl-perfect teeth. Clocking in at a little over an hour and a half ""The Prince of Egypt"" is not for the fidgety either although the films length is less of a problem than the fact that it postpones catharsis until virtually its final minutes. From an aesthetic standpoint that wait for the films emotional payoff can seem overly protracted but then again Rome and the pyramids werent built in a day - and neither was the emancipation of the Hebrew people.

"Prince of Egypt The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; prince-of-egypt-the ) Prince of Egypt The (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli For many centuries those producing mass entertainment have recognized the inherent drama and majesty in the story of the Hebrew exodus from Egypt. The tale has inspired countless plays a renowned oratorio (Handels ""Israel in Egypt"") and one of the most beloved epic motion pictures of all time (Cecil B. De Milles The Ten Commandments). Now the Exodus has been used as a basis for The Prince of Egypt which marks Dreamworks SKGs entrance into the field of glossy big budget animation. Like Fox (with Anastasia) and Warner Brothers (with the disappointing The Quest for Camelot) Dreamworks intends to challenge Disneys reign as the King of Animation. The Prince of Egypt is a worthy starting point. It ranks alongside the Magic Kingdoms Mulan at the top of the years traditional-style animated pile. Of course telling a Biblical story has forced Dreamworks to do a great deal of creative tap-dancing to avoid offending potential viewers. The last thing the studio wanted was an organized protest outside theaters on opening day. Muslim Christian and Jewish religious leaders were consulted about the script. Every effort was made to follow the source material faithfully although a disclaimer appears before the opening sequence reminding viewers that while the movie uses ""artistic and historical license"" every effort was made to remain ""true to the essence"" of the tale as related in the first 14 chapters of the Book of Exodus (Moses birth exile then return to lead his people out of Egypt). As in Mulan the subject matter is fairly sophisticated for animated fare (witness the PG rating). In keeping with Exodus the mistreatment of the Hebrew slaves is depicted (albeit not graphically) as is the mass slaughter of Egyptian firstborns that leads to the Pharaohs freeing of the slaves. And as if the story wasnt grim enough to begin with the screenwriters invented a friendship between Ramses and Moses to elevate certain aspects of The Prince of Egypt to the level of a Shakepearean tragedy. At times Moses is depicted as a brooding Hamlet-like hero. Like Antz (another Dreamworks production) The Prince of Egypt seems aimed at an older crowd although the core audience of children will still find plenty to enjoy. The Prince of Egypt neither skims over nor dwells upon the least happy elements of the story. Overall its a story of triumph and adventure - of oppression ended and freedom begun. The comedy elements that have become an integral part of animated features are downplayed. The Pharaohs two chief priests are sly and fatuous and some of their antics are amusing but they offer little more than occasional momentary comic relief. For the most part The Prince of Egypt plays it straight. As for the other ""necessary"" aspect of the successful animated feature - the musical numbers - The Prince of Egypt features about a half-dozen (from Hans Zimmer and Stephen Schwartz who wrote the lyrics for Pocahontas and The Hunchback of Notre Dame). And while none are as memorable as those from the early entries into Disneys recent wave they fold nicely into the story. The animation in The Prince of Egypt is truly top-notch and is easily a match for anything Disney has turned out in the last decade. The artists effectively mix hand-drawn and computer-generated images to good effect the colors are rich and vibrant and the characters lip movements are in synch with the soundtrack. The final product is polished with a number of standout sequences (the chariot race the plagues and the parting of the Red Sea). While last years Anastasia managed to come close to Disneys visual elegance The Prince of Egypt matches it. This impressive achievement uncovers yet another chink in Disneys once-impregnable animation armor. As far as vocal talents are concerned the film makers have gathered an impressive cast with even the minor characters being voiced by recognizable names. The plum roles of Moses and Ramses the leader of the captive Hebrews and the King of Egypt belong to Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes respectively. Michelle Pfeiffer supplies the voice of Moses wife Zipporah; Sandra Bullock is his sister the prophetess Miriam; Jeff Goldblum is his brother Aaron; and Danny Glover is his father-in-law Jethro. Other voices include Patrick Stewart and Helen Mirren as Ramses parents and the team of Martin Short and Steve Martin as the foolish Egyptian priests. Jeffrey Katzenberg (the former Disney honcho who is the ""K"" in ""Dreamworks SKG"") has gone out of his way to emphasize that The Prince of Egypt is not a religious movie despite the nature of the source material. This is not intended to be a big budget Bible Story cartoon but a rousing animated adventure. However even without resistance from religious groups The Prince of Egypt still faces a significant obstacle the large number of family-oriented features clogging the theaters this holiday season. Nevertheless even in a field that includes A Bugs Life Babe Pig in the City The Rugrats Movie and Mighty Joe Young this movie is worth a trip to the local multiplex by viewers of all ages races and religious persuasions.

The first animated musical from DreamWorks it has been drawn in a variation on the Disney photo-realist style only here the Egyptian setting with its towering pyramids and intricately chiseled sphinx its poker-faced hieroglyphics (which at one point come to life in spectacular pantomime) gives the animators a chance to create a mood of sunbaked sandstone vastness. The Prince of Egypt is no more a vulgarization of the Old Testament than The Ten Commandments was. It may turn the stormy figure of Moses into a slender mild-spirited young man (whose wispy beard makes him look like a draft dodger) but it takes him on a moral journey thats swift sure and compelling. Moses as a baby is sent floating down the Nile by his Hebrew slave parents and is adopted by the dour Pharaoh Seti. As Moses and his older brother the jockish self-doubting Ramses come of age they have a high time tearing around the urban-primitive maze racing chariots dropping water balloons treating the edifice of civilization as a private playground. Before long however Moses begins to notice whos building the playground. All around him are broken-backed Hebrews laboring on the construction of Egypts stately wonders. Respectfully DreamWorked The Prince of Egypt is now the story of a young man who redeems himself by freeing his people. The voice of Val Kilmer goes a long way toward lending Moses gee-whiz ingenuousness some virility and heft and Ralph Fiennes plays Ramses with a delicate quaver of vulnerability. Patrick Stewart makes the Pharaoh an imposing fascist. That said theres a nagging disharmony between the grandeur of the tale and the lazily anachronistic dialogue which spoon-feeds the audience. When Moses rears up at Ramses and says ""Let my people go"" I realized that the famousness of the line was all that prevented the screenwriters from turning it into something like ""Hey cant you give us Hebrews a break?"" The songs by Stephen Schwartz are mostly ""operatic"" show-tune pap (though I did enjoy the Carl Orffian opening number) and their lack of splendor ties in to whats missing from the movie. What The Prince of Egypt doesnt get at -- its nothing less than a biblical cornerstone -- is that Moses wasnt simply saving the Hebrews from captivity. He was elevating mankind to a place closer to God. Im afraid though that the Big Guys presence is rather muted here. He does come through with a few miracles but even they seem like mere special effects within the magical world of animation where visual wonders tend never to cease. In The Prince of Egypt the Red Sea parts and the feeling it gives you isnt awe; its closer to deep impact.
