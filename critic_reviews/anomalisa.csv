Released in select theaters Dec. 30 2015 ""Anomalisa"" will release widely in January. (Credit Paramount Pictures) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A troubled author falls for a naive fan.CAST David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh Tom NoonanRATED R (sexuality language)LENGTH 130BOTTOM LINE Charlie Kaufmans animated feature is one of his best films yet a haunting fable about the illusion of love. ""Anomalisa"" is the story of Michael Stone a British-born author living in the states. He isnt a glamorous figure He writes about customer service and his current book tour includes a stop in Cincinnati Ohio. Michael smokes and drinks too much but he has a bigger problem. In his mind everyone looks and sounds the same from his cabbie at the airport to his wife at home. At his hotel however Michael discovers an anomaly -- Lisa Hesselman an eager-to-please fan whose face and voice stand out from the crowd. Thats exactly the kind of morose surreal premise youd expect in a film written by Charlie Kaufman whose credits include ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"" and the relatively upbeat ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Kaufmans protagonists tend to be self-involved oversensitive types who start out unhappy and get worse. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""Anomalisa"" however is different. It isnt upbeat but it isnt thoroughly depressing either. Its a cautionary tale and a useful one about what we rightly or wrongly perceive as love. ""Anomalisa"" also is made entirely with stop-motion animation -- rare if not unprecedented for an R-rated drama. If the idea of animated figurines having awkward sex sounds kind of amusing well it is but no more so than if real people were going through the motions. The animation by Starburns Industries (whose junior partner Duke Johnson codirected with Kaufman) is astoundingly detailed and expressive. Thanks also to Joe Passarellis hazy cinematography ""Anomalisa"" perfectly captures the weird ennui of time spent inside a midmarket hotel. Making this film even odder and more haunting is the three-person voice cast. David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh (both excellent) play Michael and Lisa while Tom Noonan (best known for 1986s ""Manhunter"") is credited as Everyone Else. Noonan literally plays every other man woman and child in the movie -- a performance surely unprecedented in cinema. Its Noonan who drives home the creepy depressing sameness of Michaels world in which only Lisas voice can be truly heard. MoviesThe movies you have to see in 2016 With its spooky atmosphere and wrenching ending ""Anomalisa"" wont be to everyones taste. Its an anomaly in itself unlike any other movie youve seen.

For Kaufman Cincinnati is the perfect nondescript middle-tier Midwestern city to set his woeful tale.Stone has sad eyes and a dejected face and everyone he sees has the same expressionless glance and monotone voice (all voices other than the leads are done by Tom Noonan). He arrives at his hotel and meets Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh) who cuts through his fog of misery. They share a connection and the resulting sex scene captures the awkwardness of human copulation more accurately than most movie love scenes.But the honeymoon period doesnt last long not for Stone and not for Kaufman. The writer-director (he shares directing credit with Duke Johnson) loses focus in his third act and his points could have been handled more assuredly in an eight-minute short rather than a full-length motion picture.Kaufmans script stings with uncomfortable truths but doesnt do much else. Kaufmans medium has changed but his message is still the same.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaAnomalisaGRADE C+Rated R for strong sexual content graphic nudity and language all involving puppetsRunning time 90 minutes 7 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1Rt6ggi MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/01/16/movie-review-anomalisa-puppet-show-miserable/78916910/,200,anomalisa1,anomalisa,detroitnews

By Anthony Lane Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson direct a desolate stop-motion animated film.   Credit Illustration by Jillian Tamaki The new Charlie Kaufman film ""Anomalisa"" is set in five places an airplane a taxi a hotel a sex shop and a family home. In other words this is the story of a business trip. The businessman is Michael Stone the author of ""How May I Help You Help Them?"" which for those in the customer-service industry has the status of holy writ. We catch up with Michael en route as he flies from Los Angeles into Cincinnati; the guy sitting beside him a nervous passenger unwittingly grabs hold of his hand. This is the first of many human connections--missed ones lost ones wrong ones and desperately awkward ones--that fizzle and spark throughout the next hour and a half. The world is badly wired. We start to realize as Michael takes a cab to the hotel checks in pours a drink and calls home that something is askew about the folks with whom he interacts. They are all pretty much the same. ""Anomalisa"" co-directed by Kaufman and Duke Johnson is an animated project shot in stop-motion and the figures are molded from a common template. They have big heads short stubby limbs skin like fuzz and faces that despite minor discrepancies seem to be interchangeable and clipped into place. You can spot the line of a join under the chin and one running from ear to ear and across the bridge of the nose like a spectacle frame. (In the bathroom mirror Michaels face twitches and buzzes and once in the midst of a dream sequence it drops off.) At one point a TV is switched on and the movie thats showing--""My Man Godfrey"" the great screwball comedy about poverty and wealth from 1936--is now staffed by the same creatures who populate the rest of ""Anomalisa."" If you think thats creepy get this everybody sounds alike too. David Thewlis as dour as a wet weekend provides the tones of Michael but with a single exception the rest of the cast--the driver the front-desk clerk the bellhop Michaels wife and son back in L.A. and so forth--is voiced by Tom Noonan whose lines are sometimes layered into a one-man cacophony. Even when Michael mustering his courage phones an old girlfriend who lives in Cincinnati and invites her to meet him in the hotel bar she turns up speaking like Noonan. The over-all effect is peculiar in the extreme as though ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" had been remade with Wallace and Gromit. And yet as I say we have an exception. Her name is Lisa a guest at the hotel; she and her friend Emily work for a baked-goods company and they have come to hear Michael speak at a conference. By a happy chance their room is a few doors away from his and so it is that Michael half-drunk listens to Lisa talking in a voice he has never heard before. (It belongs to Jennifer Jason Leigh.) To him it is sweeter than a heavenly choir signalling the presence of a unique soul other than himself. They wind up going to bed together with Michael politely stipulating that Lisa make as much noise as she likes. If youve been waiting a dozen years since the release of ""Team America World Police"" for a bout of no-strings sex between consenting puppets relief is at hand. Not that it lasts long. The Lisa-powered high that raises Michaels spirits and his romantic hopes is doomed by definition to subside for this is a Kaufman film. ""Anomalisa"" may not be as smotheringly sad as his previous effort ""Synecdoche New York"" but what is? These are the only features he has directed and the doleful fog that drifts through them is devoid of the pep that other directors brought to Kaufmans screenplays like ""Adaptation"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich."" That movie with its roomful of identical Malkoviches all intoning the word ""Malkovich"" was a clear predecessor of ""Anomalisa"" but the conceit was lightly worn whereas the new film feels freighted by its own despair. Michael asked about his hotel replies ""Its boring. Everythings boring."" From where or from whom does ""Anomalisa"" spring? Partly I think from Kafka. Lisa has a disfigurement on the side of her face and when Michael asks to kiss it thus cherishing the mark that makes her different he follows the lead of K. in ""The Trial"" who tenderly puts his lips to the webbed fingers of a young woman named Leni. More broadly what drives the film is a scowling suspicion that modern man is a mechanized being created as if on an assembly line and stripped bare of individuality--a product like any other merchandise. That idea may be hoary by now and its easily mistaken for an adolescent gripe yet it slots Kaufman into an honorable tradition that reaches back to ""Metropolis"" and ""Modern Times"" and it inspires his basic disgruntled joke Why do the people in this film resemble robotic dolls? Because thats exactly what we have allowed ourselves to become. Hence the Hell of ""Anomalisa."" It is a very particular Hell--the inferno of stuff that we buy egged on by Michael and his kind. We hear it in the cheery voice that reads back his room-service order; in the catalogue of tidbits proudly recited by Lisa and her pal (""Brownie Balls dont forget""); and in the pleading of Michaels son asking what gift his dad will bring home. To Kaufman we are carved out and beaten down by a consumer society; how he might apply his wits to a developing nation say whose citizens strive to ease rather than stultify their lives with goods and services I cannot imagine. Still there are moments--the best in the film--when that chagrin is balanced by a hint of grace. Whether or not you thrill to ""Anomalisa"" and to the gentle judder of its animation you cant help relishing the scene in which Lisa closing her eyes wins Michael over with song--softly chanting Cyndi Laupers ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" first in English and then by way of an encore in Italian. You expect the reek of cheesiness only to be moved as Michael is by the heartsore fragility of her voice easy listening in the depths of a difficult film. Seldom it is fair to say does Kaufman just want to have fun but as he lifts the spell of his gloom a surprising beauty breaks through. The year has barely woken up but the prize for the Most Sardonic Film Title of 2016 has already been won. ""A Perfect Day"" is set in a war zone--or rather in a zone where war has recently raged and where despite reports of a peace accord nobody seems to have told the locals. The director Fernando Leon de Aranoa is Spanish; his stars hail from Puerto Rico Ukraine America and France; and his story takes place ""somewhere in the Balkans"" in 1995. As events unfold none of them momentous the feeling grows that they could happen anywhere. Mambru (Benicio Del Toro) and a fellow known as B (Tim Robbins) work for a charitable organization called Aid Across Borders. Any grand illusions that they once bore have been unshouldered and dumped on the wayside. What remains is the droll and sighing commitment of the stoic--a willingness to perform minor acts of assistance and relief but nothing more than that. The plot relies not on the pursuit of ideals but on a scattering of objects so stubbornly plain that they belong in a childs picture book a rope a ball a cow. The rope is attached to a fat corpse at the bottom of a well and Mambrus job is to tug the body out. We watch from below as it dangles and revolves against the sky a human reduced to an abstract shape like a cutout. With Mambru is Sophie (Melanie Thierry) a sanitation expert who knows how long it takes for dead flesh to poison water. As for the ball it is taken from a young boy by a bunch of other kids. When he protests one of them pulls a pistol at which point Mambru steps in. And the cow? Well if youre a mischief-maker you kill it drag it into the road plant mines next to it and dare any oncoming drivers like B to guess which side is safe to pass on. So acclimatized are we to action flicks and to onscreen conflicts teeming with soldiers that its refreshing to find a film that concentrates on hanging back and reversing out of harms way. We see a thug selling buckets of water at ludicrous prices; could he have thrown the corpse into the well in a bid to corner the market? Whatever the truth Mambru just shrugs and leaves whereas Sophie is outraged although her innocence it must be said comes off as whiny and meek. There isnt much zip or flavor to her role nor to that of Katya (Olga Kurylenko) a former squeeze of Mambrus. If only Aranoa had shorn his hangdog movie down to Robbins and Del Toro alone--a pair of patient no-hopers bulky and bearded ruing the wreckage of Eastern Europe like gunless cowboys eying the old West. Katya has come to ""check if the mission still makes sense"" but the guys savoring their wry humor as if it were bourbon know that the time for sense is long gone.  An earlier version of this article misstated how Lisa and Emily arrived at the conference. Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Big ScreenMovie Reviews Kaufmans Cincinnati Crisis 1 0 Grace is never cheap By Matthew Lickona Jan. 13 2016 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it Writer and co-director Charlie Kaufmans stop-motion animated film Anomalisa is a very fine portrait of the despair at the heart of a comfortable middle-aged white man in America circa right about now. British-born Michael Stone (voiced with great sympathy by David Thewlis) has by most standards made it. He lives in Los Angeles. Hes married and has a child. He is the author of the successful business book How May I Help You Help Them? -- successful enough to get him invited to speak at a Cincinnati convention of customer service professionals. But the person who needs help here is Michael Stone. Lord knows hes miserable and Lord knows he cant help himself. Hell he cant even get outside himself. Video Anomalisa Official Trailer Which is not to say he doesnt try. He indulges a cab drivers awful banter about local attractions. (""Try the chili"") He drinks. He tries to buy a toy for his son with darkly funny results. And he rings up an old flame someone from the days when change still seemed possible. (A portrait however fine is not the same as a story. However much is going on in a portrait it remains static.) All futile. And then quite by chance -- deliverance? Escape from the great sucking vacuum of the self? The discovery of the salvific other? Without spoiling anything it seems enough to say that grace is never cheap. Anomalisa  Whenever a filmmaker decides to use animation on a manifestly adult project its worth asking why. At first I thought it might be a way of making the mundane interesting -- which is kind of what Stone wishes he could do. Checking in ordering room service hanging out in a hotel bar blindingly ordinary stuff but fascinating to see it so lovingly rendered. (And as Team America World Police taught us puppet sex is memorable sex. There it was comic; here its paradoxically human.) But as the parade of voices and faces continues to pass before Stone (and us) the real reason -- sad and quietly frightening -- becomes clear.

Movie review Anomalisa Article Tweet Anomalisa Anomalisa      (out of five) Directors Charlie Kaufman Duke Johnson Stars David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh Tom Noonan Rated R (strong sexual content graphic nudity language) Run time 90 min. By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday Jan. 14 2016 Thursday Jan. 14 2016 Friday Jan. 15 2016 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram Michael Stone is in the business of helping others but as Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnsons surreal striking Anomalisa begins it is he who most needs help.The latest transmission from Kaufman one of the most unique minds ever to find its way to Hollywood Anomalisa is at first glance a paradox -- the film concerns the most mundane settings (an airplane an airport a taxi and a hotel in Cincinnati) rendered in an extraordinary way (handmade puppets rich with vivid miniature detail).As the deceptively simple story written by Kaufman unfolds it becomes clear that Anomalisa like so many compact fables before it offers those who undertake the journey something as profound as it is poignant.As Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) descends -- literally and figuratively -- into Cincinnati for a customer service conference his life is one of numbing homogeneity. In a ingenious stroke every other character Stone encounters -- male or female cab driver or room service waiter -- is voiced by the same actor (Tom Noonan) painting Stones world in boring beige strokes of blandness. Stone cant connect with anyone or anything until a chance meeting one night in a hotel corridor where the sound of Lisa Hesselmans voice (given life by Jennifer Jason Leigh) cuts through everything and gives Stone hope for the first time in what feels like forever. What makes Anomalisa more than a straightforward character study is Kaufman and Johnsons deft use of stop-motion animation which gives the hotel-bound film a surreal patina and further heightens the reality of an already borderline-absurd narrative. Thewlis Leigh and Noonan all give spectacular nuanced performances -- Thewlis in particular is remarkable as a man whose very life (and occasionally his body) is coming apart at the seams -- and convey an intimacy that serves to give considerable emotional weight to the story.Whether Michael Stone has really turned a corner in his life or merely enjoyed a brief distraction from all that troubles him is left unresolved at Anomalisas conclusion but this much is certain The audience wont soon forget what it has experienced.Exclusive Angelika Dallas Preston Jones 817-390-7713 prestonjones Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

With a single exception everyone that the main character -- a sad-sack motivational speaker named Michael Stone -- encounters sounds exactly like everyone else. Movie Review 1/2   Anomalisa featuring the voices of David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh Tom Noonan. Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson from a screenplay by Kaufman. 90 minutes.

Kaufman the mind behind ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" possesses an artistic sensibility unlike any other filmmaker working today. That sensibility informs every word and frame of ""Anomalisa"" which received an Oscar nomination for best animated feature. INTERVIEW Filmmakers Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson on Anomalisa Michael an ordinary guy who feels stifled by the humdrum reality of his daily existence is voiced by British actor David Thewlis. Everyone else is voiced by Tom Noonan. Well almost everyone else. The exception is a woman named Lisa. She speaks with the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh and therefore stands apart from the barely differentiated mass of humanity that engulfs Michael. That makes her a beacon of hope to him. In the midst of sameness there is difference. In the midst of loneliness -- and the essence of Michaels character is the profundity of his loneliness -- there is the possibility of a soul mate. ""I think youre extraordinary"" he confides to her. When she asks why he responds ""I dont know yet. Its just obvious to me that you are."" And gradually the picture casts a spell draws you in immerses you in a world of muted sorrow and tentative hope. Whats going on in ""Anomalisa""? Michael has his suspicions. ""I think I might have psychological problems"" he confides at one point. The clue as to what might be ailing Michael is in the name of the place where the picture is set the Fregoli Hotel. The name comes from the Fregoli delusion which according to the WebMD website is defined as a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that many different people are actually one person who changes shape or uses disguises. The hotel is rendered with amazing fidelity from the flat lighting in its long featureless corridors to the smallest details such as the toilet-paper roll with the first sheet folded to a point. Weve all stayed in such places clean sterile impersonal the metaphorical equivalent of Michaels life. Thewlis voices Michael with weariness and despair until the character encounters Lisa. Leigh mixes eagerness -- Lisa a sales representative from Akron is a big fan of Michaels best-selling book on motivational speaking -- and an abashed vocal quality that emphasizes her characters vulnerability. Lisa is rather plain and is very self-conscious about a facial scar. Ordinary yet oddly unique. The bond between them evolves into a startlingly erotic (especially for stop-motion puppets) sexual encounter. Its strange -- theyre puppets -- but oddly affecting. And symbolic of the essence of ""Anomalisa."" Soren Andersen 206-464-2358 or sandersenseattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

The film opens in U.S. theaters in Jan. 2016. (Paramount Pictures via AP) Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) has achieved success as a motivational speaker which is ironic considering his air of ennui. Stones lack of enthusiasm may be attributed at least in part to the fact that no matter who hes listening to he hears the same voice.That is until he meets Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a bakery-sales rep who regards him as a celebrity. Shy and unassuming Lisa is a bit taken aback when Stone invites her to join him in his hotel room. She doesnt think of herself as particularly attractive.What she doesnt realize is that her impact on Stone is seismic. Of all the people in his world shes the only one who doesnt sound the same as everyone else. Her unique voice has risen from the enervating din and taken hold of his heart. Stone should be happy. Lisa seems to love him unconditionally and hes open to the possibility of reciprocating that love. But hes not the kind of guy who trusts happiness and he cant be sure that the life to which hes become accustomed -- one of nightmarish monotony -- is really over.""Anomalisa"" is a stop-motion animated film that takes the art form in new unexpected and intriguing directions. Co-directed by Charlie Kaufman and St. Louis native Duke Johnson from a script by Kaufman its also one of the strangest films ever made -- and definitely not for children. Kaufman is best known as the screenwriter of such envelope-pushing works as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" (for which he won an Oscar) ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation."" His sensibility is at once quirky and cerebral and one comes away from his films thinking not so much about what happened as about what it all meant. ""Anomalisa"" is no exception. With spot-on vocal performances from Thewlis Leigh and Tom Noonan the film is nothing less than mesmerizing -- and must viewing for serious cinephiles.What ""Anomalisa""  31/2 stars out of four  Run time 130  Rating R  Content Sexual content nudity and language Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Charlie Kaufman teams up with St. Louis native Duke Johnson for Anomalisa Film about a man whose life is oddly out of sync uses stop-motion animation involving puppets Tags Anomalisa Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

"Anomalisa (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Anomalisa (R) A portrait of longing and alienation shot in stop-motion animation. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/14/2016 Editor rating 3 Only in a Charlie Kaufman movie can a character ask existential questions such as ""What is it to ache? What is it to be alive?"" and not come off as a freshman-year philosophy major writing his first term paper. In the movies he has written (Adaptation Being John Malkovich Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and directed (Synecdoche New York) Kaufman has used surreal premises as a launching point for wise eloquent explorations about the human need to love and create. Anomalisa which Kaufman co-directed with stop-motion animation artist Duke Johnson takes a different approach. The situation this time is drab and ordinary Michael (voiced by David Thewlis) a customer-service specialist has come to Cincinnati for a speaking engagement. Michael is married with kids and has a successful career. He should be happy. But hes in the throes of an emotional funk the nagging restless discontent that often afflicts Kaufmans protagonists. Except theres no specific reason for Michaels depression. As he takes a cab from the airport to his hotel checks in and orders room service everyone sounds the same (all of the other characters in the film save one are voiced by Tom Noonan) and they almost look the same too. And nothing Michael does -- call up an old flame to see if shes interested in a one-night stand or go out to a toy store to buy a present for his son -- works out well. Fate is conspiring to keep Michael mired in silent misery and the movie gently implies that he deserves his sadness. Then he meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the eponymous anomaly -- a lively spirited woman who is a fan of Michaels motivational how-to books and has come to Cincinnati to attend his presentation. Lisa isnt particularly bright or attractive but something about her spirit draws Michael out of his gloom. When she sings the worlds saddest rendition of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun hes smitten. ""Everyone is one person except you and me"" he tells her which is as close to an expression of love as hes capable. The prevailing mood in Anomalisa is a surreal otherness the result of the intricate stop-motion animation which is beautiful but not so polished to pass for Pixar. Banal everyday things such as Michael making a phone call become fascinating to watch A surprisingly explicit sex scene is handled so simply you forget to snicker (this is not a movie for children). The films visual artistry works as an ideal counterbalance for Kaufmans heady brand of middle-aged despair. Anomalisa was originally written as a radio show to be performed live on the stage. Now with only a few tweaks it has been turned into an equally effective movie proof that the pain of longing and discontent doesnt abate no matter the medium.

"Anomalisa | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; anomalisa ) Anomalisa (United States 2015) January 13 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Anomalisa offers evidence that animated films are not necessarily the sole province of children. In fact this one isnt even designed for all adults. Charlie Kaufman has always been something of an acquired taste. Anomalisa highlights Kaufman at his best and worst. About 30 minutes of this movie is brilliant - a near perfect illustration of what it means to fall in (and out of) love. Unfortunately the films other two-thirds is less impressive - at times unremarkable at times weird and at times tedious. At worst it can be said that Kaufman has made a discussion-worthy animated feature. The film begins with a seemingly commonplace set of circumstances presented almost in real time. The only unconventional aspect of this 30-minute sequence is that its presented using stop-motion animation rather than live actors. Motivational speaker Michael Stone (David Thewlis) has arrived in Cincinnati for an engagement. After landing at the airport he hails a taxi takes the short ride to his luxury hotel (no smoking - the cab driver is asthmatic) checks in goes to his room tips the bellboy orders room service and makes a couple of phone calls - one to his wife and one to an old flame who lives in the city. The ordinariness of these activities although grounding the story makes Anomalisa difficult to get into. For most of the first half-hour I was more interested in the craft of the film than the narrative. A few things immediately become apparent. Other than Michael the men and women populating Cincinnati look similar. Also regardless of sex they all sound remarkably like Tom Noonan. Anomalisa is closing in on the halfway point before it strikes pay dirt. Thats when Michael encounters Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a woman who despite having no obvious outstanding characteristics is different in every way from everyone else. She doesnt sound like Tom Noonan. Her features arent those of a clone. She jolts Michael out of his funk and he immediately becomes obsessed with her. He contrives to get her alone in his room and they have a heart-to-heart discussion followed by a sexual encounter thats more real than anything one usually encounters in live action dramas. But as often isnt the case in motion pictures theres a morning after... At its heart Anomalisa explores the mystery of attraction and the bane of overfamiliarity. Michael is addicted to the ""honeymoon"" phase of a relationship - when everything is new and exciting. He falls for Lisa because theres something about her thats different. The movie depicts it literally - by giving her a unique form and voice - but its more about psychology and chemistry. The night they spend together is magical. But by morning the newness has faded. Again this is depicted literally. Lisa begins to sound like Tom Noonan. Her features alter ever-so-slightly. The decision to make Anomalisa as an animated film is an artistic choice. Given advances in special effects it wouldnt have taken much effort to do this live action. (The production certainly would have been less time-consuming.) But the lack of real actors lends an odd Twilight Zone quality to the production that enables us to note little details that might otherwise escape notice. Its almost unnerving to watch so many ordinary mundane moments captured in perfect detail by the animators. The first half hour drags but it ultimately serves the purpose of immersing us in this reality. The animation by co-director Duke Johnson (best known for his involvement in the subversive Adult Swim series Mary Shelleys Frankenhole) uses stop-motion techniques with marionettes.  The puppets have been designed to look semi-realistic without crossing a line that invites criticisms of creepiness. Production required more than a year of painstaking effort; Johnson is quoted as saying that it took six months to animate the sex scene to avoid making it seem comedic. Speaking of the sex scene this may be the most controversial element of Anomalisa. Graphic enough to be called pornographic by some viewers the sequence is an honest representation of how a sexual encounter might transpire in these circumstances. It seeks to be true-to-life both physically and emotionally. Had exactly the same scene been presented using live actors theres no question the movie would have been saddled with an NC-17 rating. Anomalisa began life as a radio play; Kaufman wrote it in 2005 (it remains set in that era). Initial film plans were to make a 40-minute short. In retrospect that might have been a better approach. Significant chunks of Anomalisa feel like filler - not only the protracted beginning but a weird dream sequence and an on-stage breakdown. The films core is strong and compelling - Kaufman at his most artistically vibrant. But the commercially influenced decision to stretch out the film to feature length does Anomalisa no favors.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Jan 8 2016 Culture The first act of Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnsons animated film Anomalisa plays out as an unassuming slice-of-life drama It follows an Englishman named Michael Stone (David Thewlis) as he flies to Cincinnati takes a cab to his hotel and checks into his room brusquely interacting with chatty strangers the whole time. But the film--made with stop-motion animation and eerily realistic 3D-printed puppets--is slowly pervaded by a sense of horror. As Michael chats with his cab driver about Cincinnati chili or a hotel clerk about the kind of room he wants it becomes clear that every other character whether male or female is speaking with the same voice (Tom Noonans to be precise). Its a remarkably effective depiction of the worlds sameness seen through the eyes of a character whos long forgotten how to connect with people.Related Story All Stories Are the Same Into this nightmare walks--what else--a special woman. Anomalisa like so much of Kaufmans work is about someone who sees himself as existing outside of society and whos both emboldened and depressed by that fact. If that sounds like a tough person to spend 90 minutes with well it is. Hes a man who sleepwalks through life whos fallen for and walked away from multiple women for reasons he cant explain who literally sees everyone else as a drone. That is until he hears Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) another hotel guest whose voice stands out of the crowd for him. As Anomalisa explores their meet-cute watching the movie evolves into a frustrating internal struggle Should viewers feel happy for the pair? Or terrified for Lisa?As voiced by Leigh Lisa is the standout character of the film--which of course shes meant to be. A shy but warm-hearted and appreciably goofy soul she brightens up a film thats often near-impossible to watch when its focused on the somnambulant Michael. Through the theatrical device of having her voice stand out in the crowd and the pinpoint casting of Leigh (whos always excelled at playing alluring weirdos) Kaufman and Johnson find a wonderful new angle on depicting what its like to fall hard for someone. The hard part is watching it happen to a man as thoroughly awful as Michael.To be fair Anomalisa has genuine sympathy for its protagonist and his flaws; its main challenge is getting viewers to feel the same way. Very early on viewers learn about Michaels history of unhappy short-lived relationships. The minute Lisa draws his attention the films existential horror shifts from the world around Michael to the passion he suddenly feels for Lisa which he fears will slip away at any moment.Anomalisa has genuine sympathy for Michael and his flaws. Its challenge is getting viewers to feel the same way.After 40 minutes of aggressive intentional dullness Anomalisa becomes far more compelling to watch. Though puppet sex is notoriously difficult to pull off a scene between Michael and Lisa is astonishing in its awkward intimacy. Though the content itself is pretty gentle its unsettling to watch simply because it feels so realistic and ordinary--one of those romantic sequences where Kaufman and Johnsons direction really shines. Given the incredible human likeness of the puppets the uncanny valley should pose a problem but it doesnt which feels like a feat on its own.Despite its focus on romance on the whole Anomalisa left me cold perhaps because of its narrow focus and predictable ending. Yes Michael is a lonely perhaps clinically depressed soul whose issues with intimacy could fill a psychiatrists pad. But he makes for a surprisingly dead-end protagonist after so many Kaufman scripts that explored identity and life on a much grander scale from Synecdoche New York to Being John Malkovich. The impact of Anomalisas early drudgery lingers even after the arrival of Leighs character. But Kaufmans writing works best when its about people genuinely contending with what it means to be human. If Anomalisa fails its because Michael cant quite bring himself to relate to anyone else on earth.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings."" Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

(Paramount Pictures) David Thewlis provides the voice for Michael Stone in the stop-motion animated film Anomalisa.(Paramount Pictures) Anomalisa Gimmicky stop-motion puppetry masks predictable tale Add to ... Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 08 2016 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 08 2016 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson Written by Charlie Kaufman Starring David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan Classification 18A Genre comedy Year 2015 Country USA Language English After Anomalisa premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival this past September you could practically hear the sighs of relief echoing throughout the theatre. Finally it seemed there was a TIFF movie worthy of adulation after a festival otherwise stuffed with feel-good Hollywood fare (The Martian) middling art-house offerings (Freeheld) and outright disappointments (I Saw the Light). Critics could go home satisfied that the fall movie season was saved and festival organizers could feel relieved they produced a worthy Oscar contender and future classic. Cue the happy ending. But for all the praise tossed Anomalisas way - ""a movie with wit to burn"" The Guardian raved; ""a minor miracle"" Variety cried - I couldnt help but walk away underwhelmed. Or at least puzzled by its cinema-saviour status.Its not as if I wanted to be the outlier. After all the film comes from the mad mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman whose Adaptation Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind remain among my most cherished movies. (I even adored his directorial debut the oft-pretentious but still wild Synecdoche New York.) And in a seemingly progressive bit of cinematic trickery the very serious and very adult Anomalisa stars not a cast of humans but stop-motion puppets in the style of cutesy kids flick The Nightmare Before Christmas and that old Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer TV special. Its as if the film was designed to appeal to both my inner child and my inner snob. Both were left feeling disappointed.Anomalisa adapted from Kaufmans own stage play is mostly a two-hander It chronicles the quick and messy relationship between Michael a bestselling author of self-help business books (voiced by David Thewlis) and Lisa a cubicle drone with a serious self-esteem problem (Jennifer Jason Leigh). (Theres also a third voice too but revealing the specifics of Tom Noonans role would spoil the films one sharp turn.)The unhappily married Michael is in the midst of a midlife crisis if not a full-blown breakdown while the single and shy Lisa is simply seeking validation from the outside world. A flirtation begins and develops into something deeper - or something that Kaufman assumes is deep. Really the pairs banter and interactions are paint-by-numbers simple depression and neuroticism as sketched out by a child perhaps the same sort of child whod prefer stop-motion puppetry to flesh-and-blood performers. And thats where the films biggest irony and weakness lies.Kaufman wants to use an inherently immature style of movie making to give heft to his serious (but in reality quite weak) subject matter. Puppets who have real feelings and awkward sex? A story of lifes desperate corners told through the lens of whats essentially a cartoon? Its a backward trick that mistakes the bizarre for the brilliant.Without its stop-motion conceit would anyone be talking about Anomalisa? Would critics and audiences be so enamoured with its stunted characters and predictable narrative? That may come across as an easy dismissal of the technological and artistic prowess on display here but by applying a gloss of childish kitsch to an otherwise mediocre tale Kaufman is forcing the question to the fore. Yes the filmmaker and co-director Duke Johnson laboured for years over this project and their set design is often astonishing. But that doesnt mean the film is a masterpiece or even half a masterpiece.Anomalisa will be described by many as bold and revelatory and even a new step in cinema. But there are strings attached - you can see over and over again where it all falls down.

The film opens in U.S. theaters in Jan. 2016. (Paramount Pictures) Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Anomalisa 4.5 stars Starring David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh Tom Noonan (voices) Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson Duration 90 minutes Animating films for kids is a given. Animating films for adults needs a reason. And the wonderfully polished stop-motion puppetry of Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnsons Anomalisa serves as a brilliant plot device - a launchpad for the feverish imagination of Kaufman (Being John Malkovich Adaptation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and his touchingly-written playlet about existential alienation. Anomalisa is the tale of an outwardly-successful man who sees everyone else in the world as essentially the same person (voiced by the same person Tom Noonan - whether as man woman or child). It seems almost sociopathic narcissism to see only yourself as real. The irony is that Michael Stone (David Thewlis) has made his name with a bestselling business-oriented self-help book called How May I Help You Help Them? On a lonely booze-sodden business trip to Cincinnati to address a customer service conference he looks up an old love with quick and angry results. He calls home for a few perfunctory words with his wife and son (all voiced by Noonan). And then he meets two of the conference delegates - young women out for a good time one of whom Lisa is the only other person we meet with her own voice (supplied by Jennifer Jason Leigh). The meek untraveled unschooled Lisa is an anomaly in Michaels world - hence Anomalisa. Its a metaphor for connection. A smitten Michael wants nothing more than to bring Lisa back to his room and hear her voice over and over. (Yes there is puppet sex and nudity - the first in a theatrically released feature I can remember since Team America World Police). There are esoteric elements to the stop motion puppetry reminiscent of other art-house animated works. When faceplates and other plastic pieces fall off people it reminded me of Ryan the Oscar-winning Canadian animated short in which characters were missing chunks of themselves - internal trauma made external. These nods to the fact that we are watching objects fragile ones at that underscores our own fragility and essential difficulty getting past each others surfaces. For all that Anomalisa is a far more human story than most films Ive seen with actual humans in them. If youre one of those people who needs a likeable protagonist to like a movie this is not for you. Michaels deeply-rooted problems bounce us from being appalled by his insensitivity to pitying his hauntedness (there are some terrific fantasy scenes that give us glimpses of his otherwise unknowable mind). But he is never a hero in any sense. Lisas vulnerability and essential goodness make us feel for her. But whatever else it is this is not a love story. Which is not to say that the moments Michael and Lisa share in Michaels hotel room arent touching in the extreme. The two characters bare their souls before baring anything else. Add a script with just enough comic relief (a cleverly-written awkward conversation with a chatty cabby is our first hint of Michaels misanthropy) and youve got one of the smartest current films in any medium.

You might have a co-star in the form of your significant other and supporting players a.k.a. your co-workers and your boss and your friends and theres an endless supply of extras i.e. all those people contributing background noise and visual stimuli as you navigate every minute of your life. The disturbingly brilliant ""Anomalisa"" which springs from the mind of Charlie Kaufman (""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"") is a movie about that Im-in-my-own-movie feeling (among many other things). And even though it is a highly stylized stop-motion animation film featuring puppet-like human characters it is a pinpoint-accurate encapsulation of some of the most banal AND some of the most exhilarating moments virtually all of us have experienced at some point in our lives. David Thewlis voices Michael Stone 40ish seemingly clinically depressed self-obsessed. Michael is on an overnight trip to Cincinnati to deliver a speech about his mega-selling book How May I Help You Help Them which has become the Bible of customer service workers across the land and has made him a celebrity within said customer service community. The sound in ""Anomalisa"" is a thing of wonder. When were on the plane with Michael or following him through the airport or in a hotel bar we pick up snippets of conversation and background clutter noise -- and its as if were right there with Michael. Michaels cab ride from the airport to the hotel is a thing of deadpan beauty. Michael clearly isnt interesting in mindless chit chat but the cab driver picks up that Michael is British and says he loves how English people say things like ""the States"" and ""shrimp on the barbie."" Even after Michael repeatedly tells the cabbie hes here just for one day on business the cabbie insists Michael visit the Cincinnati Zoo and sample Cincinnatis chili which is nothing like the chilis Michael has had elsewhere. When Michael checks into the luxurious Fregoli Hotel he encounters the unnecessarily long check-in and settle-in ritual weve all experienced. The front desk clerk hunches over the keyboard typing and typing and TYPING before confirming the reservation. The bellhop goes into ridiculous detail explaining things (""This is your bathroom""). When Michael finally figures out which button on the phone is for Room Service the voice on the other end goes into excruciating detail about each item he orders and then repeats the order before telling him dinner will arrive in exactly 35 minutes. We begin to realize something. Everyone Michael talks to sounds the same. Exactly the same. In fact the wonderful veteran character actor and filmmaker Tom Noonan gives voice to everyone Michael Stone meets in this movie with one notable exception. Even when Michael looks up an old flame and they have a contentious encounter in the hotel bar she sounds like everyone else in Michaels world. Bursting through Michaels narcissistic wallowing is one Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) an awkward unsophisticated sweet and enthusiastic young woman who is slightly overweight and has a scar on her face and is absolutely bowled over when she meets THE Michael Stone at the hotel. Lisa and her girlfriend work in customer service and theyve made the four-hour drive to Cincinnati and theyve even splurged on a room at the Fregoli just so they can absorb the wisdom of Michael Stone. (A word about the name of that hotel. The Fregoli Delusion is a rare condition in which an individual is convinced many people in his life are actually the same individual in disguise. In ""Anomalisa"" even Michaels wife and son have that same voice that same Tom Noonan voice. Only Lisa breaks through his haze and actually sounds like another person.) Lisa is naive and sad and painfully honest about her life. She hasnt been with anyone in eight years. Shes never stayed in a nice hotel before. She loves to sing karaoke with ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" her go-to song. (Her a capella version of ""Girls"" is one of the saddest and most beautiful musical interludes in any film in recent years.) Michael falls hard for Lisa. Hes almost euphoric Hell leave his wife and son and start a new life with Lisa. Finally he can shake off the feeling of being alone. Lets leave things there. If you took the script of ""Anomalisa"" and assigned the same fine actors to the movie only this time setting it in the real Cincinnati and putting those actors in front of the camera would it work as an indie slice of loneliness and alienation? Probably so. Yet somehow these sad-faced relatively simplistic odd little puppets seem like the perfect vehicles for this journey. You know when critics say ""Youve never seen anything quite like this"" and its almost always blurb-y hyperbole? Im telling you Youve never seen anything quite like this. [s3r star=4/4] Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson and written by Kaufman. Running time 90 minutes.

Comments Anomalisa Recommended Video Rated R  90 minutes  2016 Originally a pseudonymous play by eccentric screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) this uncanny and moving stop-motion animation tells a story of loneliness selfishness and fragile connection. A customer-service guru (given voice by David Thewlis) arrives in Cincinnati to lecture at a business conference and tries to reconnect with an old flame then settles for drinks and possibly more with a pair of single women in his hotel who are gaga to meet him. Kaufmans comedy of personal discomfort is much in evidence though in this case the awkward moments are acted out by puppets created with a 3-D printer; the movie plays like a Rankin-Bass TV special penned by Tom Stoppard. Kaufman made his directing debut with the ambitious and unwieldy Synecdoche New York (2008) which involved the construction of a miniature city; by contrast this second theatrical feature is tightly focused its only windows those that open onto the mind. Duke Johnson codirected; with Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan. By J.R.

"Anomalisa delights the eye but shrivels the spirit review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAnomalisa delights the eye but shrivels the spirit review Stop-motion animated drama Anomalisa summons viewers to marvel at the films craft while lamenting the sad humanity on display. David Thewlis voices Michael Stone while Jennifer Jason Leigh voices Lisa Hesselman in Anomalisa.  (Paramount Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 7 2016AnomalisaAnimated drama featuring the voices of David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh and Tom Noonan. Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. Opens Friday at the Varsity. 90 minutes. 18AIs it possible to be enthralled and depressed at the same time?Anomalisa summons both feelings marvelling at the films craft while lamenting the sad humanity on display. The eye delights the spirit shrivels. Article Continued BelowAn animated drama co-directed by acerbic absurdist Charlie Kaufman (Synecdoche New York) and stop-motion ace Duke Johnson the film epitomizes what David Bowie calls ""the poignancy of the everyday.""It focuses on the narrow concerns and confines of Michael Stone (David Thewlis) a morose Englishman residing in L.A. who has made a good living but not much of a life. He peddles inspiration as the author of How May I Help You Help Them? a successful how-to book for customer service pros. Yet hes unable to find much uplift for his own unhappy existence which includes a wife and young son with whom hes clearly not fully engaged.The distancing is in part due to constant travel which on this day brings him to Cincinnati home of a world-class zoo and to-die-for chili. Michael is to give yet another speech about his book to eager customer service types.His mood isnt helped by the drab sameness of his hotel room -- is there one design for all of North America? -- and the dreariness of Cincinnati the zoo and chili notwithstanding. The plaintive score by Carter Burwell a frequent Kaufman collaborator makes the ennui seem almost tragic.Why does everybody look and sound alike a parade of dull faces? (Hint Google the name of Michaels hotel The Fregoli.)But Michael has issues much deeper than boredom. Alcohol is a crutch to help him cope with what he thinks might be ""psychological problems"" but which others would call callous behaviour. On a previous Cincinnati stint he broke the heart of Bella an ex-girlfriend who still lives in the city. Michael meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a naive customer services rep for a baked-goods firm who has the room down the hall. She and her friend Emily drove all the way down from Akron just to hear his speech never dreaming he might be interested in them personally.The scenario is all too predictable but Anomalisa -- which wordplays on ""anonymous"" ""anomaly"" and ""Lisa"" -- brings astounding exactitude to the most mundane of activities not least of which is a sex scene that rivals Team America for puppet lust.The technical flair is amazing -- those unnerving mask lines are deliberate by the way -- and the screenplay has the droll whimsy and intelligent angst that signifies Kaufman who previously wrote Being John Malkovich Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.Anomalisa is a triumph if also a dispiriting one.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Try Anomalisa as haunting and hypnotic an R-rated  love story for grownups as youll see anywhere. Leave it to Charlie Kaufman the virtuoso screenwriter of Being John Malkovich Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind to follow up his intellectually  audacious 2008 directorial debut with Synecdoche New York with another groundbreaker. Anomalisa partly funded through Kickstarter digs deep into the mysteries of human nature by using stop-motion puppets with faces that look like masks. Kaufman enlisting co-director Duke Johnson (an Emmy winner for a stop-motion Christmas episode of Community) works wonders and not just because the puppets get naked and get it on. Whats miraculously inventive here is the way these rubbery barely sketched-in figures come to remind us of ourselves. More News Toronto 2015 Why Anomalisa Is the Fests Must-See Movie 25 Reasons We Loved the Movies in 2015 10 Best Movies of 2015 All Stories >> Related Charlie Kaufman on His Puppet-Love Masterpiece Anomalisa What happens? A motivational speaker named Michael Stone (superbly voiced by David Thewlis) spends the night at a Ohio hotel where he will give a speech to customer-service reps attracted by  his bestseller  ""How May I Help You Help Them."" In his room Michael visibly sags. His marriage is shit as we hear from a phone call home to his wife and son. His room  is impersonal deadening in its luxe anonymity. Out of desperation he arranges to have a drink in the hotel bar with Bella the local woman he dumped a decade ago. Bellas voice is filled with resentment and recrimination. To Michael every voice sounds the same. Maybe because it literally is the same since the invaluable Tom Noonan speaks for every character -- male and female -- that  Michael encounters from taxi driver to concierge. That is until he meets Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) an exuberant sales rep who worships at the altar of Michael. When he invites this perky stranger back to his room she cant believe her luck. Lisa has her share of hard-luck stories of loves lost and opportunities missed. Michael relates to her loneliness but admires her resilience something he lacks. The sex is perfunctory -- Lisa has some body issues -- but their connection is real. And Leighs voice performance is truly a work of art. She can go from sweet to sorrowful without missing the lifetime of beats in between. And when she sings for Michael -- a slowed-down seriously heartbreaking take on Cyndi Laupers ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" -- hes a goner. You will be too about the time you forget youre watching puppets and not the real thing. The bracing humor and aching tenderness Leigh brings to the role deserves the highest praise. Just dont go hoping for lasting love though Michael briefly believes the anomaly in his life that is Lisa will be his salvation. (Not in Kaufman country it wont.) And yet Anomalisa which originated on stage as a sound experiment from composer Carter Burwell gets under your skin in ways you cant imagine.  This unique and unforgettable movie seems to be made up of scraps -- a few puppets three voice actors the barest of budgets. And yet filtered through Kaufmans searching mind and soulful brilliance the result is a masterpiece.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Is it right to call a movies visual details sumptuous when they reflect the blase designs of bona fide daily life? If they precisely copy the bland pastel fabrics omnipresent in an ordinary hotel and the wishy-washy gray that hot shower steam leaves on a bathroom mirror? What if they are handcrafted near-perfect miniatures designed to draw us toward a protagonist exhausted by his pallid life and personality? Thats the quality of attention that ""Anomalisa"" focuses on its story. Its the latest from Charlie Kaufman who has given us remarkable worldviews in ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" With the help of co-director Duke Johnson it creates an amazing work with crossover appeal as adult drama melancholy csomedy and unexpected stop-motion animation. At its center is Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) a fifty-something consumer service guru visiting a Cincinnati convention to deliver a speech. He is depressed and socially awkward despite his intelligence. He keeps people at arms length whether its the fellow passenger who gives his hand a nervous squeeze as their plane roughly lands or the talkative cabdriver who takes him downtown endlessly recommending the citys perfectly sized zoo and perfectly prepared chili. The population of this monotonous Midwestern purgatory sounds uniform to him because that is how he perceives everyone. Whether its a singer delivering an aria on his iPod a phone call to his wife and son or dull small talk with every Tom Dick and Sally they sound precisely the same through the admirably shaded vocal performance of Tom Noonan. Whatever their height or shape they all have look-alike faces. Michael passes between them like a man afraid of smothering from ennui protecting himself by communicating hardly at all. Then his pessimism is overturned by Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh in a tender turn rivaling her bloody fireworks show in ""The Hateful Eight""). She doesnt sound or look like the rest. She isnt sophisticated. She doesnt understand parts of Michaels book even with a dictionary. But she doesnt communicate in the insincere upbeat monotone of everyone else. Shes different. Following a few drinks at the hotel bar he invites her to his room where she sings ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" in a cappella English and Italian. Suddenly drunken Michael falls in love leading to a clumsy but honest and moving bedroom scene with the lifelike puppets anatomically correct genitals in full view. The film rated R might be NC-17 if it was in live action but it is not pandering for a moment. ANOMALISA 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong sexual content graphic nudity and language. In English and Italian. Theater Uptown. The intimate scene hints that Michael might be moving out of his midlife breakdown. Then again a weird phone call summoning Michael to the hotel managers office and an attack of sexual panic that follows it could negate everything before as a meaningless extramarital fling. In the fresh light of the next morning he seems to modify French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre silently implying that hell is other people at breakfast. When the confused Michael delivers his productivity-boosting address to hundreds of fans he veers helplessly off course. ""What is it to be human?"" he asks. ""What is it to ache? What is it to be alive?"" Though he has written a popular book on the idea of commitment to the service of others it seems like a concept foreign to him. ""Anomalisa"" not only renders its warts-and-all human portraits in a remarkable craft that is almost photorealist it shows personalities with extraordinary precision too. In its morose sort of genius it is the well-off self-absorbed middle-aged mans ""Inside Out."" ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

If Kaufman who adapted his radio play for the film imagines it he can bring it about. We get the idea with directors like Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Birdman"" ""The Revenant"") that what we see on screen is close to what he saw in his head when he conceived each shot. With Quentin Tarantino its a safe bet were hearing what he heard when he wrote the dialogue.AZCENTRALHow Anomalisa director Charlie Kaufman got funding support for puppet filmBut foremost among contemporary screenwriters and directors Kaufmans complete vision is unique and sometimes hard to decipher. For instance ""Synecdoche New York"" Kaufmans last directorial effort in which a playwright creates an existential work about his own life was exceedingly challenging and all the better for it; it remains one of the greatest movies of the 21st century.Puppets notwithstanding ""Anomalisa"" is more straightforward or so it seems at first. Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson begin the story on a plane to Cincinnati where Michael Stone (voice of David Thewlis who like the few other people who provide voices is brilliant) is traveling from his home in Los Angeles to give a speech. Hes a motivational speaker who has written a bestseller about customer service and has a featured gig at a conference. Its all mundane stuff -- the inane banter about the citys chili from the cabby taking him to his hotel the polite-but-phony service from the desk clerk and the bellhop and whatever other small details make up such a trip.Until you notice that everyone but Michael -- man woman or child -- sounds the same (courtesy of the voice of Tom Noonan). For Michael this is what his boring world has come to. Even when he makes an appointment to see his former lover whom he dumped years earlier in the hotel bar her voice is identical to everyone elses (though it must be said quite a bit angrier).And then by accident he meets a couple of convention attendees two women hitting the big city for fun. Theyre star-struck by running into the main speaker but thats not all Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) sounds like no one else. She sounds like ... Lisa. Finally in this desert of sameness someone different. She is an oasis. Michael is smitten in part because of her clear admiration (maybe adoration) of him in part because of her wounded vulnerability and in large part because of her voice.AZCENTRALTop 10 movie puppets E.T. Star WarsAn intense affair ensues (and fairly graphic particularly for you know puppets); both Michael and Lisa seem satisfied.But this is Charlie Kaufman. Nothing is ever that simple even in a movie about the banalities of life because even the banalities of life arent simple. If there is a quirk a problem the hint of a sideways occurrence Kaufman will not only pick up on it but bore in. Things are resolved but to whose satisfaction? Well Kaufmans maybe and in that respect ours.Why puppets? One might think they would give the film a more impersonal feel but the effect here is the opposite. There is something about the stop-motion animation -- the weird lines across the faces the familiar-but-different settings for the various scenes -- that makes it seem so real it is painful at times. Perhaps we think we can reach out and control Michael when he does something idiotic (his present from his trip to his son is one hilarious example). And yet no. We cant. Kaufman and King somehow give felt puppets an independence they might otherwise have lacked. How?The magic of movies I guess. Or more likely the magic of Kaufmans mind. Thats on full display here and thats always reason to sit up and take notice. ""Anomalisa"" is no exception.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday January 7 Follow AnnHornaday Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) connects with Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) in ""Anomalisa."" (Paramount Pictures) Theres a special place in movie heaven for Charlie Kaufman. The writer of such beguiling mind trips as ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" -- who made his directorial debut with the confoundingly gnarly ""Synecdoche New York"" -- Kaufman represents something rare in filmmaking genuine originality. Cerebral sensitive sometimes excruciatingly erudite hes a philosopher king among denominator-lowering commoners. Hes high-minded which would be obnoxiously off-putting were it not for the note of tender melancholy that graces his work like a pale just-bloomed bruise. With ""Anomalisa"" Kaufman engages in yet another feat of sad and satirical fantasy about people trying to get out of their own heads. As the film opens a customer-experience expert named Michael Stone is flying to Cincinnati to attend a professional convention and flog his new book ""How Can I Help You Help Them?"" On the plane in the taxi from the airport at his upscale hotel Michael submits to the usual small talk. Judging from the way people look at him in the hotel lobby hes something of a minor celebrity. He makes his way to his room fiddles around with the phone orders room service and looks out the window into the featureless night. So far so banal. Except that Michael (voice of the British actor David Thewlis) is portrayed by a stiff but eerily lifelike puppet as is every other character in ""Anomalisa."" Whats more the supporting players all have the same face and share a flat similarly affectless voice that resembles Jimmy Fallon at his most soft-spoken. These opening moments of the film -- which Kaufman directed with Duke Johnson -- are weird mesmerizing and very funny recalling ""Lost in Translation"" in their precise evocation of the rituals creeping annoyances and numbing dislocation of travel. Like that earlier film ""Anomalisa"" pivots around a chance meeting that Michael has with another traveler a woman named Lisa who -- unlike the great wash of anonymous faces and voices around him -- manages to connect with Michael on another movingly specific level. As voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh -- currently on display being brutalized bloodied and abused in ""The Hateful Eight"" -- Lisa is a vivid poignant character a woman whose insecurity and awkward sense of humor elicit almost immediate protective sympathy. Her a cappella version of ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" followed by perhaps the most disarmingly honest sex scene in the history of puppetry brims with equal parts strangeness and sincerity. Both Thewlis and Leigh play it absolutely straight as ""Anomalisa"" unfolds and viewers are invited to speculate on what it all means. At first the filmmakers seem to be wittily illustrating Michaels own narcissism with everyone whos not him taking on the same generic blandness. But an encounter soon after his arrival in Cincinnati suggests that the conceit may have more to do with obsession guilt and unresolved remorse. ""Anomalisa"" possesses a few running gags that only add to its sense of the surreal mostly having to do with Cincinnati boosters touting the citys famous chili and zoo. And Kaufman includes a dream sequence that takes Michaels already bizarre journey into the realms of nightmarish horror. Its at this point that ""Anomalisa"" takes a pessimistic unreadable finally equivocal turn becoming either a meditation on desire and romantic disillusionment a plea for individual identity and connection or a hopeless portrait of existential loneliness. Or maybe ""Anomalisa"" is none of the above. Whether or not Kaufmans meticulously accumulated details add up to a grand unified conclusion theres no doubt hes getting at something painfully familiar beneath his movies self-conscious artifice the unsettling question of just what it is thats pulling our strings and who can possibly love us despite our obvious cracks.

David Thewlis voices Michael Stone and Tom Noonan voices Bella Amorosi -- as well as almost every other character. Photo Paramount Pictures Associated Press Anomalisa Puppet animation for adults 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""Anomalisa"" one of the great films of 2015 is an R-rated animated feature about adults made for adults. It represents a breakthrough not in terms of technology though its technically expert but in its use of the animated form. Merely animating an adult subject might be interesting but thats nothing to be excited about. Instead ""Anomalisa"" finds an adult story that could have been effectively achieved only through animation and then realizes it with precision sensitivity and shocking humor. Adapted by Charlie Kaufman from his own radio play ""Anomalisa"" takes place over two days and tells the story of a successful author who has a peculiar and dispiriting mental condition. He sees everyone as the same person. He can recognize differences in peoples hair and clothing and size but their faces are the same and so are their voices. Even when he listens to music -- such as Delibes ""Flower Duet"" -- its the same voice that he hears again and again. This voice coming out of everyone is played by Tom Noonan in one of the most extraordinary vocal performances in all of animated film. Noonans challenge was to find ways to suggest differences in the speakers age sex and disposition without changing the basic quality of his voice. He couldnt do what a professional book reader might do adopt different voices for different characters. Instead he had to convey the external reality of each speaker through the filter of his own natural voice and this he accomplishes time after time with much wit and subtlety. ""Anomalisa"" tells its story through the use of puppets and stop-motion animation kind of like the old ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" Christmas special but two generations down the line in terms of sophistication. These puppets are manipulated to portray nuanced gradations of emotion in which they react with minute changes in expression as another character speaks. The ultimate effect is that very little is lost by having puppets and not people do the performing while other things are gained -- an eeriness and a fascination. We cant forget that its not real so that even a simple sight like watching two characters walk down a corridor seems a little miraculous. And when its not miraculous its funny -- as when Michael (David Thewlis) the author takes a shower in his hotel and has to keep hopping into and out of the water because its either scalding or freezing cold. In a live action film it might very well be amusing to see this familiar aspect of travel cited in a movie but the fact that its a puppet experiencing it makes it a little more comical. We meet Michael in a miserable place in his life. Everything is drab and the same -- ""its boring"" Thewlis says in a tired English way that hides a world of depression behind the mask of understatement. Through clues dropped throughout we realize that Michael has suffered from this strange isolation for at least 10 years. Now in Cincinnati on a business trip he reaches out to a former girlfriend in the hope that seeing her might jar his spirit back to life. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the voice of the title character a perfectly average person named Lisa who becomes the anomaly in Michaels recent experience. For some reason he can see her and he can hear her actual voice not Tom Noonans. Within a compressed time period of just a couple of days ""Anomalisa"" becomes an urgently felt love story between a lonely woman and what has to be the loneliest man on Earth. The situation has the force of metaphor and Kaufman who co-directed the film with Duke Johnson keeps things vague enough to serve a number of meanings and functions. We know what afflicts Michael but we never precisely know why. Is his a problem of perception? Very subtly Kaufman hints that Michaels torment may be the result of his own moral failing but even if it is he cant address it because he cant see it. By the end it becomes astonishing how much emotion ""Anomalisa"" persuades us to invest in these puppet people -- just as its incredible (until you see it) that a love scene between two puppets can have more power than 90 percent of the live-action love scenes of the past year. ""Anomalisa"" may simply be a brilliant one-off but its pointing a new direction for animation if anyone cares to follow it. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

(Paramount Pictures via AP) Review Charlie Kaufmans Anomalisa will break your heart Wednesday December 30 2015 0502 PM By LINDSEY BAHR AP Film Writer In ""Anomalisa"" everyone looks and sounds the same. They have the same face (Caucasian bland non-descript). They have the same voice (Tom Noonans). They bore our protagonist Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) to death. And this feeling that hes the only individual on the planet among all these clones might be the cause of his unravelling. In this very R-rated stop-motion animated feature scripted by Charlie Kaufman (writer of ""Adaptation."" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") and co-directed by Kaufman and Duke Johnson we spend one day with this sad sack narcissist on an overnight trip to Cincinnati. Hes there to give a lecture about his book ""How May I Help You Help Them"" a top selling manifesto on the art of customer service. Its successful enough that people in the hotel recognize him immediately. But hes still sad. He has a stilted conversation with his wife and son who stayed behind in Los Angeles. He calls an ex-girlfriend to see if shell meet him for a drink. Their breakup was fraught and so is this encounter. Back in his room Michael sinks into himself bereft of an easy hookup. Its just him and his Belvedere martinis with a twist until he hears an alarming sound from the hotel hallway -- a voice thats not Tom Noonans. Its Jennifer Jason Leighs. Michael bursts out of his room like the owner of this voice is his last chance for survival frantically knocking on random hotel room doors to find her. The woman has travelled from Akron Ohio (over 200 miles) to hear him speak. Shes a big fan as is her co-worker. And this woman is different in voice and face. Her name is Lisa. Shes an anomaly. Shes his Anoma-Lisa he tells her later when things get intimate. Leighs nuanced vocals bring what could have been a slip of a character to life. Its a stunning emotionally truthful performance that makes you wish more awards would recognize voice acting. Lisa has the confidence of a middle school girl (read none). Her levels might even be in the negative numbers. She is sweet and excitable and good-natured but cripplingly self-conscious. She second-guesses everything she says. She ends sentences with ""shut up Lisa"" She thinks shes ugly dumb and unsophisticated. Actually Lisa is basically a girl in an adult womans body. She is gawky and awkward. She stumbles over her own feet and really likes to press the buttons in the elevator. But she still goes back to Michaels room when he asks her to after a few drinks knowing full well what that means. The story doesnt willfully hide details from the viewer but it does evolve in surprising ways. Even after two viewings I cant settle on a single thesis. Thats probably what makes it valuable. You can feel for Michael and empathize with his existential solitude or you can roll your eyes at him. I did. Hes fairly insufferable and it takes a while to realize that perhaps the problem isnt everyone else -- its him. Hes unable to see outside himself and condescends to others with abandon while profiting off of a customer service ideology that he clearly doesnt believe -- that everyone deserves to be loved that everyone is an individual that a smile costs nothing and can make a persons day.There is little entertainment in watching a narcissists worldview realized. Its more like heartbreaking dread. The fact that Kaufman (his follow up to ""Synecdoche New York"") and Johnson (his first feature) accomplished all of this with puppets is all the more astounding.""Anomalisa"" is an anomaly.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 30 2015 Save for later Saved Anomalisa includes voice work by David Thewlis and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Paramount Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Anomalisa"" is another fantasia from the perfervid imagination of Charlie Kaufman the screenwriter of ""Being John Malkovich"" ""Adaptation"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" Kaufman demonstrated a fondness for puppets in ""Malkovich"" and now with ""Anomalisa"" a stop-motion project co-directed by Duke Johnson he has made a movie inhabited entirely by figures made of felt. The wonder the astonishment is that these puppets are invested with a full range of human emotion. The film is about Michael Stone (beautifully voiced by David Thewlis) a motivational speaker in the service industry with a new book out called ""How May I Help You to Help Them?"" A transplanted Englishman living in Los Angeles with his wife and young son Michael is first seen flying into Cincinnati where he is due to give a lecture the next day before flying back.He seems deadened by the thick gabble of small talk on the plane and the anonymous bustle in the airport. He wearily engages with a talky cabbie on the ride to the hotel an upscale establishment named Al Fregoli. That monicker is Kaufmans little in-joke except the joke is all-encompassing Fregoli is a delusional condition in which paranoiacs believe they are being tormented by a single person hiding behind multiple disguises. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Michael isnt necessarily paranoid but the movie registers his psychic unravelment by rendering all but one of the people in the film with essentially the same face and voice. (The flat affectless intonations are all by Tom Noonan.) The one exception is Lisa (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh at her best) whose sprightly speech which Michael first hears outside his door lures him like a sirens call into the hotel hallway. She is the anomaly in his world - his ""anomalisa."" The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide But before he encounters Lisa one of the first things he does after he checks into his room is call up out of the blue the old flame still living in Cincinnati that he walked out on 10 years earlier. Bella when she finally agrees to meet Michael for a drink in the hotel bar is a seething bundle of resentments and the reunion is a disaster. Doubling up on his martinis Michael whose marriage is clearly on the rocks acknowledges to her that ""there is something wrong with me."" This motivational speaker blurry with midlife depression is looking for a reason to motivate his life.He finds it with Lisa who with her friend Emily also a customer service rep for an Ohio baked goods company is staying at the same hotel to hear Michaels lecture. (Few other movies besides ""Lost in Translation"" perhaps have been this good at depicting the steady-state vacuity of the generic hotel experience.) Mousy insecure smitten by her idol Michaels attentions Lisa cant quite believe he is interested in her. She is wary enough to regard with some suspicion his offer to mix her a drink in his room but what follows is one of the stranger sequences in the annals of animated film a nuanced awkward seduction graphically rendered yet immensely touching between two lost souls. Their physical nakedness is matched by their emotional nakedness. Thewliss line readings are resonant beseeching and so are Leighs. Lisa has a poetic fragility in this sequence never more so than when she slowly sings almost in a hush Cyndi Laupers ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun."" She turns it into a soulful anthem. ""Anomalisa"" began as a 2005 play written by Kaufman under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli and staged only twice with live orchestration by Carter Burwell for his ""Theater of the New Ear"" sound-play project. A Kickstarter campaign financed the film and if you sit through the end credits youll find 1070 names listed for ""special thanks."" The stage material is immeasurably enhanced in its stop-motion incarnation.The puppets ambulate with a thick grace as if they were pressing through tide pools and their faces are sectioned as interchangeable masks with the joints between the upper and lower halves visible. The effect is a creepy plasticity that points up the characters mutated states of mind especially in a dream sequence in which Michaels anxieties become truly Fregoli-infested.That dream sequence worried me for a while because it looked as if the film was morphing into the sort of loopy phantasmagoria for which Kaufman has an unfortunate weakness. His 2008 directorial debut ""Synecdoche New York"" was borderline unwatchable but even his standout successes like his script for ""Being John Malkovich"" had a few too many metaphysical zigzags. ""Anomalisa"" ironically is perhaps his most human achievement. Perhaps because of the arduousness of the animation process required to bring them to life using puppets rather than actors (except of course in voice-over) frees Kaufman to focus on what really matters in the characters lives without a lot of curlicues.Kaufman once told Charlie Rose on his TV show that ""I have this very adverse reaction to Hollywood romances. Theyve been very damaging to me growing up."" ""Anomalisa"" is a kind of corrective to what Kaufman perceives as the damages of happy-faced Hollywood and yet it shares some of that same movieland sunniness - at least as an unattainable ideal. We know that Michaels instant infatuation with Lisa for whom he vows to leave his wife is not built to last. We know his almost manic high will be followed by a deep despondency. But these disappointments dont falsify Michaels ache for transcendence. His downfall is that he knows too well what his limitations are. The professional helper is resigned to helplessness.

"Charlie Kaufmans Anomalisa reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up A Beautiful Tricky Heartbreaking Puppet Show From Charlie Kaufman A Beautiful Tricky Heartbreaking Puppet Show From Charlie Kaufman Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 31 2015 1010 AM Anomalisa A beautiful tricky heartbreaking puppet show from Charlie Kaufman. By Dana Stevens Charlie Kaufmans Anomalisa. (c) 2015 Paramount Pictures Charlie Kaufman and stop-motion animation belong together as has been clear since long before their meeting in the wondrous new movie Anomalisa co-directed by Kaufman and animator Duke Johnson. In the past Kaufmans scripts--in which psychological states often have unsettlingly literal effects in the physical world--have led Spike Jonze (Adaptation Being John Malkovich) and Michel Gondry (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) to find their inner puppeteers. (Not for nothing was that the profession of John Cusacks character in Malkovich.) Kaufmans first film as both writer and director Synecdoche New York ostensibly takes place in a live-action world of flesh-and-blood people. But the philosophical questions Synecdoche raises seem to cry out for animated treatment. In the latter half of that movie Philip Seymour Hoffmans theater-director protagonist having spent years laboring over an impossibly vast project that would somehow represent every aspect of his lived experience as art eventually casts another man (played by the great actor and director Tom Noonan) as his own double. Soon that initially benign double starts--as doubles will do--to cast doubt on the Hoffman characters own identity. From there its a simple leap into the world of Anomalisa a movie made up of plastic simulacra including in a sly bit of voice casting Noonan once again. Michael Stone (voice of David Thewlis) the depressed writer of a successful customer-service self-help book called How May I Help You Help Them? is on a plane en route to Cincinnati where he will check into a posh yet dreary hotel meet up with an old flame for a drink take phone calls from his coldly furious wife and eventually  have an unexpected encounter with a woman (voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh) he meets by chance. Beginning with the chorus of mumbled voices that opens the film--layers of overheard in-flight conversations each more banal than the last some of them repeating each other phrase for phrase--it becomes clear that were hearing what the world must sound like to Michael dull empty a vague scrim of undifferentiated noise. Everyone he meets has the exact same pleasant impenetrable affect whether flight attendant taxi driver or hotel desk clerk. Advertisement Almost exactly halfway into this 90-minute movie a truly different person suddenly appears an anomaly. Lisa. Anomalisa. (To really get Charlie Kaufman you have to be OK with portmanteau-pun titles.) Voiced by Leigh with great humor and fearless vulnerability shes a bubbly but insecure Midwestern sales rep treating herself to a weekend away with a female workmate. The women get a little tight on apple mojitos and Lisa winds up having a nightcap in Michaels hotel room (beautifully imagined as is the whole production in drab melancholy hues that recall the interiors of the cartoonist Chris Ware). The encounter between Michael and Lisa--a long slowly unwinding love scene thats this sometimes savagely unromantic movies beating heart--is so unexpectedly intimate and ultimately so heart-rending that Ill leave off the plot description there and instead try to describe the curious visual and aural experience of seeing Anomalisa. The camera (Joe Passarelli was the cinematographer) takes its time following these stiff not-quite-natural figures as they move through say a bleak Muzak-filled hotel lobby. But theres something about the upfront artificiality of these figures--all of which have visible seams across their faces where the 3-D-printed plates making up their heads come together--that keeps them well clear of that fabled uncanny valley into which computer-animated human beings can still sometimes fall and soon the movies deliberate pace comes to seem like a natural fit for its somber (but never humorless)mood. The movie reveals its surprises with equal deliberation and part of the pleasure later is in thinking back to recall just when it was you figured out the odd perceptual tricks Kaufman and Johnson are getting up to in the movies design and execution. Whatever combination of practical effects and digital wizardry went into the technique that gave rise to Anomalisas otherworldly yet very human narrative universe I hope it will be used to tell more stories perhaps by this same storyteller. The word Fregoli recurs in Anomalisa Its the name of the hotel where Michael and Lisa have their fraught encounter. Kaufman originally wrote the script under the pseudonym Francis Fregoli to be performed in a roundtable reading by three actors. (Its only after 10 years of trying and a Kickstarter campaign that Kaufman managed to get the project made in animated form a treatment he initially resisted.) The reference is to the Fregoli delusion a mental disorder that makes the sufferer see the rest of the world as populated by multiple versions of a single malevolent individual bent on his or her destruction.  That psychological condition is never mentioned by name or otherwise invoked in the film--if what ails Michael needs a medical label Id go with plain old unglamorous clinical depression. (At one low point he does wonder aloud whether his dissociated state might be a side effect of Zoloft.) By placing us inside the jointed plastic head of a man whos shut out the world for too many years the ingeniously imagined flawlessly performed Anomalisa suggests we may all be walking around with some version of the Fregoli delusion at least until those rare moments when we come across a voice or a face that somehow feels different enough to remind us that another person--maybe someone right there in the room with us--is equally alive.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Most Charlie Kaufman movies are tricky to write about because theyre too certifiably insane to summarize--just trying to explain what happens in Being John Malkovich Adaptation or Synecdoche New York can exhaust a hefty word count. Anomalisa by contrast is relatively simple at least in concept. But that concept which originated in a play Kaufman wrote for composer Carter Burwells Theater Of The New Ear some years ago is best experienced tabula rasa allowing its disorienting strangeness to sneak up on you. The films marketing campaign has been kept deliberately even studiously vague and violating its air of mundane mystery would arguably be doing potential viewers a disservice. If youre a Kaufman fan you definitely want to see Anomalisa and are hereby advised to put off reading anything more about it (including the paragraphs that follow) until you do. Only the certifiably damaged--meaning Kaufman agnostics and/or people who habitually read the last chapter of a book first--should forge ahead now.In truth there is no big twist in this movie... but theres also a reason why such a small-scale intimate story set almost entirely in a Cincinnati hotel was shot using stop-motion animation rather than actors. (Kaufman co-directed the film with Duke Johnson who previously animated the stop-motion episode of Community.) At first ones attention is drawn to gorgeous visual details like the rain-spattered windows of the taxi hailed at the airport by protagonist Michael Stone (voice of David Thewlis) whos just arrived in Cincinnati to give a business lecture about superior customer service. But as Michael interacts with the cabbie the hotel desk clerk the bellhop and eventually an ex-girlfriend with whom he ineptly tries to reconnect while hes in town the light gradually dawns Every character who isnt Michael shares the same eyes and they all male and female speak with the same flat voice (Tom Noonan). Which is why Michael is instantly overpoweringly drawn to a fellow hotel guest named Lisa whose puppet has her own distinct facial features and who speaks in the gloriously non-Noonan voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh.Like Synecdoche which was partially inspired by the Cotard delusion (hence the name of Philip Seymour Hoffmans character Caden Cotard) Anomalisa derives its central metaphor from a real-life incredibly bizarre neurological syndrome. Here the hotel where Michael and Lisa stay is called the Fregoli--Kaufmans winking reference to the Fregoli delusion in which the afflicted party becomes convinced that numerous people in his/her life are secretly the same individual in disguise. Anomalisa makes literal this paranoid idea in order to explore the intense ""you and me against the world"" feeling that someone whos stuck in a rut can experience upon making a random connection with another human being. Lisa who works in customer service and drove four hours with her friend Emily (Noonan) to see Michael speak is shy and slightly disfigured and utterly lacking in self-esteem yet Michael is prepared to leave his wife (Noonan) and abandon his young son (Noonan) after knowing her for only a few hours. Is there any basis in reality for his conviction that he and Lisa share something special and unique? Is she in fact anomalous?By Kaufmans high standards the answer to those questions is unusually predictable; many will guess the resolution of Michael and Lisas affair well in advance. That scarcely matters though given how beautifully distinctive Anomalisa is from moment to moment. Kaufman and Johnson have designed the puppets with numerous imperfections both human (bodies tend to be flabby and are lets say anatomically correct) and mechanical (no effort has been made to erase the seams where separate face plates connect) which makes the movie almost unbearably poignant at some times and downright nightmarish at others. And Kaufmans gift for absurdist comedy finds numerous outlets in the minor annoyances and indignities Michael suffers a garrulous cabbie (Noonan) extolling the wonders of Cincinnatis chili and zoo; indecipherable icons on his hotel rooms phone; a visit to a 24-hour ""toy store"" thats not exactly geared toward children. Most of all Anomalisa in common with virtually every film Kaufman has written struggles to make peace with the knowledge that we are all fundamentally alone. Thats the biggest spoiler of them all.

Courtesy of Paramount Pictures A guy who thinks everyones the same meets a gal whos different. That could be the TV listing for Charlie Kaufmans extraordinary new film and latest weirdness Anomalisa. But that thumbnail description doesnt get at the weird and the weird in this film is prodigious. Start with the fact that in a world that looks otherwise real and natural the leading man -- motivational speaker Michael Stone -- and all the folks around him are puppets which are animated in stop-motion. And except for Michael they not only look the same -- think crash-test dummies with different clothes and hairstyles -- but they sound the same too. His seatmate on the plane the cabbie who picks him up at the airport Michaels wife on the phone his 5-year-old son every staffer at his hotel the characters in a movie on TV an ex-girlfriend he gets in touch with -- everyone. Kaufmans Being John Malkovich spent an hour or so building up to a scene full of Malkoviches all with that actors face and cadences. This film co-directed by Kaufman and Duke Johnson starts there and builds from a cacophony of voices (that are all Tom Noonans voice) to a series of vignettes featuring Noonan-voiced characters so that by the time Michael is ensconced at the Fregoli Hotel youre pretty fully in his world. Calling the hotel the Fregoli by the way is an obscure but very cool joke. The Fregoli delusion is the name of a psychiatric condition in which sufferers believe all the people around them are really incarnations of just one person who is tormenting them. i Lisa voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh is an anomaly in a world of same. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Lisa voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh is an anomaly in a world of same. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Michael doesnt actually believe that but he does see people as interchangeably unremarkable and the film lets you see them that way too even as its making the unremarkable things theyre doing visually arresting -- because after all they are puppets. Michael for instance engages in puppet showering puppet profanity puppet nudity and puppet hallucinations (where his jaw starts clacking and his face comes off in pieces as he looks in the mirror). Its in the middle of that hallucination that he hears something in the hallway that takes him utterly by surprise a womans voice but more than that a different voice. Lisa voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh. In a world of same shes an anomaly -- Anomalisa. Michael excitedly runs down the hallway knocking on doors to no avail until behind one he hears her voice again and invites her (and her roommate as an afterthought) to join him for a drink. Michael is smitten and Lisa is too. And that will lead to puppet sex and puppet smoking after sex and all manner of other things that would make Anomalisa intriguing to watch even if novelty were all it had going for it. But whats fascinating is how the things that make the film different are the very things that make it emotionally engaging. David Thewlis lonely stammer as Michael Jennifer Jason Leighs heartbreaking insecurity as Lisa have a kind of universality when wedded to expressions on plastic figures you quite forget are plastic. And that lets filmmaker Kaufman tap into an existential loneliness most films can only hint at. In Anomalisa hes doing precisely what his characters are -- reaching out searching for a connection. And for 90 minutes in the theater he finds it.

New because they begin at the oddest points. Like a secret passage into John Malkovichs brain. Or a memory-erasing machine that can leave you with a spotless mind. Old because in the end their story is almost always the same story. I met someone once who I knew I could never live without. And then one day I found out Id have to. ""Anomalisa"" which Kaufman wrote and co-directed with Duke Johnson has once again an odd title and a fresh approach. In this case the film is done with stop-motion animation -- small fully-jointed puppets going to business conferences having panic attacks having sex. Dont tell Wallace and Gromit. Theres another twist in the tale too (and a mild spoiler alert) Everyone sounds the same. The film begins in darkness with a babble of voices until we hear one -- the Northern English tones of David Thewlis as Michael. But then an oddity becomes clear Everyone Michael meets on his trip to Cincinnati -- young old male or female -- sounds alike. (In fact theyre all voiced by character actor Tom Noonan.) Then Michael meets Lisa who sounds like -- Lisa. (Actually she sounds like Jennifer Jason Leigh.) And thats how Michael knows and more importantly we know that she is different special in some way perfect for him. (And how we also know if we know Kaufman that none of what follows will be easy.) To be frank the lack of other character voices is initially disorienting and also unclear -- could the production not afford a full cast? Is Kaufman making some sort of point about sexual orientation? -- which is why I risk giving away the gimmick. Because once you realize it the story becomes much more satisfying. There are moments of humor here and real observation (Ive never seen a mid-price chain-hotel room recreated so perfectly) but mostly this story is very sad. Michael is a middle-aged author of business-success texts geared towards telemarketers. He has a wife and a son. He doesnt like either of them much. They return the lukewarm feelings. And all he can think about it the woman he used to love and left for no good reason 10 years ago. And then he meets Lisa the young woman down the hotel hall whos a bit smitten by his celebrity -- and how pathetic is that? -- and shy and vulnerable in a way he finds erotic. Theres a whole other movie in that -- the way damaged people can feel better about themselves by trying to save even-more-damaged people -- that this film doesnt explore. And even at this brief length the film feels a bit padded at times (theres a surreal dream sequence for example that adds nothing). And yet like all of Kaufmans stories it has the wonderfully weird pull of feeling like something weve never seen before -- while telling us a story we know all too painfully well. Ratings note The film contains puppet-on-puppet sex strong language and alcohol abuse. Anomalisa (R) Paramount (90 min.) Directed by Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnson. With the voices of David Thewlis Tom Noonan Jennifer Jason Leigh. Now playing in New York.    1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty.

"Anomalisa review An exceptional romance from Charlie Kaufman - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Anomalisa review An exceptional tale from Charlie Kaufman Trailer Anomalisa Official trailer for ""Anomalisa."" (YouTube) Official trailer for ""Anomalisa."" (YouTube) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Sad beautiful the wittiest film of the year ""Anomalisa"" takes place largely in a hotel room in Cincinnati where a customer service expert (his well-regarded book ""How May I Help You Help Them?"") has traveled from Los Angeles. Hes delivering the keynote address at a regional customer service conference. Honestly could the premise for a feature-length story of middle-aged malaise and inchoate yearning be any drabber?Hardly. And yet directors Duke Johnson and Charlie Kaufman working from a script Kaufman originally wrote and staged a decade ago transform the comedy of quiet desperation into an occasion for serious pleasure. If you have a problem with stop-motion animation ""Anomalisa"" isnt your movie. Johnson Kaufman and puppet supervisor Caroline Kastelic created 1/6th scale models of all the characters and settings on 18 separate warehouse mini-soundstages. We are there spying on the action in various parts of the Al Fregoli hotel with Michael and his acquaintances. But ""there"" looks just strange enough to make ""Anomalisa"" a bracing expedition into parts unknown.In disarmingly warm light supported by composer Carter Burwells inspired empathetic string-based score (eight musicians gorgeous results) we first see Michael on the plane into the city famous for its chili. Michaels a British transplant somewhat at odds with LA and the parameters of his life his wife his son himself. The character based visually on co-director Johnsons ex-brother-in-law according to Johnson is given the precisely right vocal inflections by David Thewlis. We learn soon enough in a tetchy phone call home that Michael has trouble connecting. Who will help the man who helps the people who help the customers? After checking in (the front desk clerk never breaks eye contact even when hes typing) Michael calls up a bitter old flame whose last letter to him (""Dear Michael f--- you"") haunts him 11 years later just as his unexplained bailing-out of the relationship haunts her. They meet in the lobby bar. The reunion goes ... like it goes. Then Michael meets a couple of locals in for the convention plainly impressed and a little smitten with the guest speaker. One of the women is Lisa voiced with a truly heartbreaking combination of sweetness and crippling insecurity by Jennifer Jason Leigh. What happens between Michael and Lisa two contrasting and intersecting studies in insecurity and need takes ""Anomalisa"" where it needs to go. ANOMALISA Paramount Pictures David Thewlis voices Michael Stone and Jennifer Jason Leigh voices Lisa in the film ANOMALISA by Paramount Pictures. cr Paramount Pictures - Original Credit Paramount Pictures David Thewlis voices Michael Stone and Jennifer Jason Leigh voices Lisa in the film ANOMALISA by Paramount Pictures. cr Paramount Pictures - Original Credit Paramount Pictures (Paramount Pictures) Kaufmans scripts for ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Adaptation"" and others put him on a level most other writers never will reach. You can teach craft but you cant teach ideas or how to express moods and feelings in surprising honest ways. The hotel name ""Fregoli"" contains a clue to Michaels psychic state. I Googled it The Fregoli delusion refers to a paranoid belief that various people are actually the same person. Every puppet person in ""Anomalisa"" looks like a member of the same vaguely anonymous extended family. Tom Noonan provides the voice for each and every supporting player from hotel desk clerk to cabbie to preteen female child. Hes great; so is Carters plaintive score the best of the film year 2015.Another few minutes wouldnt have hurt this remarkable achievement especially near the end when wed like to dig a little deeper into Michaels circumstances post-Cincinnati. Kaufmans work as always finds its stealth energy in the sheer anxious business of moving through the world and figuring out your hearts destination. Just when you think he might be going easy on his protagonist theres a morning-after breakfast scene that marks Michael who smokes and drinks steadily through the 90 minutes of ""Anomalisa"" as a man with a short fuse and a long list of petty grievances no matter whos in his orbit.Theres a sex scene here that is nothing like the puppet sex scene in ""Team America World Police"" for the record. Does Michael learn anything from Lisa the woman who just wants to learn how to have fun and in fact at one point sings ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" in the most forlorn possible voice? He does yes though the life lessons are messy contradictory and bittersweet. Kaufmans perspective and the perspective of the animation design is that of a world where virtually everyone is like everyone else. Now and then however you meet someone who in the parlance of customer service surveys exceeds expectations. ""Anomalisa"" certainly does. Its Chekhovian screwball a perfect little tale of love (or thereabouts) in bloom among the weeds of an ordinary life. It feels like a classic already.

Photo Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Anomalisa Running time 90 minutes. Rated R (profanity puppet sex and nudity). Theres something strange and dreamlike and delicate and beautiful about ""Anomalisa"" an animated film for grown-ups that takes a long while to make its point but does so with a dark brilliance. Its stop-motion animation written by ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" scribe Charlie Kaufman and co-directed by Kaufman and Duke Johnson in which the puppet characters seem achingly human. David Thewlis voices the central character a marketing guru who lives in Los Angeles but is spending a single night in Cincinnati to deliver a motivational speech before hundreds of worshipful fans. Michael StonePhoto Paramount Pictures Something is eating away at him and he has regrettable encounters with his wife on the phone and with an ex-girlfriend in the hotel bar. The ungainly title of the picture seems to be a reference to his anomie -- his inability to feel comfortable in any group -- and perhaps it is on one level. But the direct meaning of the word ""Anomalisa"" becomes perfectly clear when the film stops being a rueful low-key comedy of awkwardness and takes a sudden completely unexpected turn into deeper waters. I dont want to describe what happens but its endearingly original bittersweet and a little funny. Essentially the movie is an elongated short story about a love affair making ingenious use of one simple central metaphor. (A clue is in the name of the hotel where the main character is staying Its the Al Fregoli which refers to a specific disorder. Look it up.) Puppets get naked and have sex in the movie and yet the scene far from being ridiculous is in a quiet way transcendent universal. The making of stop-motion ""Anomalisa""Photo Paramount Pictures Kaufman who has a tendency to ramble off in too many directions at once (as in ""Being John Malkovich"" for instance) has never before managed so elegantly to contain and structure the products of his fertile imagination. He has created a powerful approach to the question of what makes people fall for each other and how they could just as easily lose interest. Theres a devastating scene set over a breakfast table thats comparable to the famous one in ""Citizen Kane."" Occasionally you hear people grumble about the originality/quality of the movies these days but these same people ignore the offerings that dont have huge marketing budgets big-name stars or plots that can be described in 30 seconds. ""Anomalisa"" partly funded via Kickstarter is something marvelously different and it would simply have been dismissed as too offbeat for any audience as recently as 15 years ago. Its not just imaginative its a wonder.

(Paramount Pictures/AP) BY Allen Salkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday December 28 2015 400 AM Title Anomalisa Film Info With David Thewlis Jennifer Jason Leigh Tom Noonan. A unique psychological drama made using stop-motion animation. Directors Duke Johnson Charlie Kaufman (130). Rated R for strong sexual content graphic nudity and language. Landmark Sunshine. How to describe ""Anomalisa""? Um. It is the ""Gone with the Wind"" of Existentialist puppet movies. It is what would happen if Gumby and Woody Allen co-directed. It is as if a French New Wave director from the 1950s cast his film with The Muppets -- assuming Miss Piggy is willing to perform topless and Kermit is fully functional. What if Gumby and Woody Allen co-directed? Thats Anomalisa. Whatever it is Charlie Kaufmans latest mind-twister is a unique examination of narcissism from the same guy who has been exploring the brain in such films as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Being John Malkovich."" In its most basic form ""Anomalisa"" is the story of Michael Stone the author of an inspirational customer service book ""How May I Help You Help Them?"" During a tour Stone has an encounter with one of his fans in a hotel room. It doesnt sound like much but a lot happens as Stone considers his semi-miserable existence before and after he enters that room. This may not sound like much fun but its all so fascinating that you wont be able to move your eyes away. Kaufman has said that he never intended for the script which started as a rudimentary stage play to become a film let alone a puppet film. He was talked into it by the stop-motion whiz Duke Johnson. Thank you Mr. Johnson. Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) and a fan Lisa Hesselman (Jennifer Jason Leigh) explore the Existential hell of Stones life in the animated ""Anomalisa."" (Paramount Pictures/AP) To evoke a mood of human connection found and lost animators created puppets that are weirdly life-like in their movements and mannerisms and yet with their seams showing are clearly unreal too. Audiences are treated to the sight of anatomically correct puppets engaged in graphic sex. No external wars are fought during the encounter between Michael and the fan Lisa no cities burned no one ever says outright that frankly they dont give a damn. But the films thoughtful script and astounding craft portray a tragic inner psychological battle that one senses as Stone travels home may never end. Its like Punch and Judy without sticks.

But once you start reckoning with Anomalisas obsession with self-absorption the novelty of this one-man pity party begins to wear off. As R.E.M. once sang everybody hurts. In Charlie Kaufman and Duke Johnsons Anomalisa that goes for puppets too. The characters in this obsessive drama about human suffering and isolation are stop-motion-animated figures something like the ones in Wes Andersons Fantastic Mr. Fox only a lot less cute and a lot more depressed. Michael (voiced by David Thewlis) is a successful motivational speaker--his specialty is customer service--who has come to Cincinnati from Los Angeles for an engagement. After checking into his anonymous faux-fancy hotel he calls an old flame hed walked out on without explanation years before. Hed been thinking about a final letter shed sent him and had become wistful about her. We hear someone read the letter in voiceover but the voice attached to these feminine hurt feelings belongs to Tom Noonan--in fact as Michael goes about his all-too-human hamster-wheeling every voice he hears male and female is voiced by Noonan a smart idea that amplifies Michaels distance from his own feelings as if he were moving about in a stage production being playacted by the wrong people. Michael it turns out is cracking up. He meets with the old flame but it doesnt go well. In desperation he runs through the corridors of his hotel knocking on doors claiming hes ""looking for a friend."" Its hardly a lie. And thats how he meets Lisa a young fan (voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh whose awkwardly cheerful presence gives the movie some soul). When Michael hears her voice-- hallelujah its not Noonans--his previously dead eyes light up with wonder. At last he has found someone genuinely human. Lisa--shy slightly overweight and with a minor facial disfigurement--is amazed and flattered by Michaels attention. They sleep together in a scene that particularly for puppet sex is staged with remarkable tenderness but its clear this bliss cant last. How many love or nonlove stories have begun this way? Kaufman (making his first film since his 2008 directorial debut Synecdoche NY) and Johnson (whose credits include Adult Swims Moral Orel) work hard to make us feel something for this man whos capable of feeling so little for others and the idea of using puppets to tell a story about intensely human experiences is inspired to a point. But then we have to actually look at them Their skin has a powdery latexy semi-translucent glow--theyre more like embryos than actual grown-ups which is perhaps part of the point. Michael is a shell of a person struggling to be a person. But hes also a megalomaniac a reality the film doesnt quite cop to He doesnt recognize that every other human being is alone in his or her skin too. And once you start reckoning with Anomalisas obsession with self-absorption the novelty of this one-man pity party begins to wear off. A little puppet pain goes a long way.

But despite his wildly ambitious premises and death-defying narrative techniques theres always been more to his films than just formal trickery. Hes a stuntman who understands that the stunt works only if it burrows its way into your heart as well as your head. Thats why Kaufman movies such as 2002s Adaptation and 2004s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind have withstood the test of time. Theyre strange yes. But strangely touching too. Actually Id probably call the relationship between Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine the most powerful and honest expression of the mysteries of love Ive seen in the past 15 years. I wouldnt have thought it possible but in his latest head trip Anomalisa (which he wrote and codirected with Duke Johnson) Kaufman has nudged his penchant for wiggy experimentation a step further. Hes not just bending the notion of romance into another Mobius-strip confection; hes also playing with form telling his tale through a groovy version of stop-motion animation that makes it feel like Franz Kafkas remake of Team America World Police...but you know with sympathy and soul. British actor David Thewlis provides the voice of Michael Stone a lonely middle-aged motivational speaker who flies to Cincinnati to rally a crowd of customer-service drones at a conference. The opening moments of the film allow the audience to gradually acclimate to its visual strangeness by focusing on the drudgeries of Michaels trip. He suffers through a chatty taxicab ride from the airport to his hotel he checks in to his drab room he orders room service and calls home to let his wife and son know hes arrived safely. He even makes a half-baked plan to meet an ex in the hotel bar that goes disastrously awry. As routine as all of this sounds its clear that theres something odd going on here. Everyone Michael meets whether male or female speaks with the same affectless tone of voice (all provided by hangdog character actor Tom Noonan with dry perfection). Then he bumps into a female fan whos...different. Her name is Lisa (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and even though shes the first to admit that shes nothing special in either the personality or looks department the fact that she sounds like no one else enchants him in a way he cant explain. Which actually is as perfect a metaphor for finding your soul mate--the single person who speaks to us and us alone uniquely--as Ive ever heard. In bed after a round of surreal puppet sex that rivals the Kama Sutra stylings of Trey Parker and Matt Stone he gives this one-of-a-kind woman hes determined to spend the rest of his life with the nickname Anomalisa. Its obvious that Kaufman has always seen the world differently from the rest of us. And even if it takes a little time to settle into Anomalisas disorienting herky-jerky groove Kaufman ends up bewitching us with his fresh take on the oldest and most hackneyed of cinematic themes boy meets girl...and anxiety ensues. Anomalisa is a staggeringly inventive Trojan horse of a film. It dazzles our senses with a shock of the new. And while were trying to process what were witnessing hes slyly and subversively getting us to grapple with lifes bigger and thornier questions--questions about love and happiness selfishness and commitment and most of all whether were content to walk numbly through our daily lives or instead be alive to its infinitely strange and beautiful possibilities.

(Philadelphia Film Festival)By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 23 2015Anomalisa the singular and stunning opening-night number of this years Philadelphia Film Festival begins with a pitch-dark screen and a mounting cacophony of voices - aural detritus everyday yak. Then a sun-burnished cloudscape appears a jet slices through the cumulus were inside the plane and the passengers are all . . . puppets.In one row with the eyes of a sad unsatisfied man sits Michael Stone (the voice of David Thewlis) en route from Los Angeles to a conference in Cincinnati where he is to be the guest speaker. He is the author of a customer-service book How May I Help You Help Them? We spend the rest of this stop-motion animated tale (yes the same painstaking process used for Gumby Wallace and Gromit Fantastic Mr. Fox) in his self-loathing company.And for a time in the company of Lisa (the voice of well well get to that) an eager-beaver customer-service worker who has driven from Akron to hear Stones talk. Martinis (him) and mojitos (her) are downed an elevator takes them from the hotel bar to his room and the rest isnt left to anyones imagination.Written and codirected by Charlie Kaufman the angsty maestro behind Being John Malkovich Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Adaptation - movies that poke around the brainpan to disturbing often comic effect - Anomalisa offers a portrait of a man in a midlife morass of regret and mundanity. Hes in existential crisis (hey who isnt?) pulling on cigarettes and pulling up his pants over an unflattering girth.Part of the creepy genius of Anomalisa - codirected by animator Duke Johnson adapted from a Kaufman play (under the nom de plume Francis Fregoli) and funded in no small measure by 5770 Kickstarter fans - is that its not-quite-lifelike humans both mirror our reality and suggest the tenuous hold we have on it. Things could unhinge.Anomalisas title conjoins the word anomaly with the name of Martins newfound friend. ""Your voice is like magic"" he tells her and indeed as spoken (and sung) by Jennifer Jason Leigh Lisas words open up a window that lets Martin look at the world - and hear it - in a different better way. But odds are that its a fleeting thing odds are that all the babble (every other characters voice is that of actor Tom Noonan) will descend on Martin again.After all its a Charlie Kaufman world.

You can picture him hunched over parchment accurately inking each dark river and off to the side cautioning that there be dragons. What makes Kaufman cinemas best psychoanalyst is a contradiction. He sees people for who we are--hurtful hopeful lovely lonely and dull--and yet believes that The Self is a delusion. His characters are complex and true but theyre never in control. Theyre costumes (Being John Malkovich) brain-wiped customers (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and actors in someone elses play (Synecdoche New York). He sees the world like an anxious party guest watching himself from above and groaning ""Why did I do that?"" The shame matters more than any solution.With each script Kaufman has exaggerated his characters impotence. In his newest Anomalisa he goes to the extreme by literally making them puppets. Anomalisas stop-motion figurines look real. Their bellies sag their testicles droop. Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson animate their brows and mouths so their speech is smooth not that clap-clap-clatter of marionettes. But the faces are purposefully false. A crack runs across the bridge of the puppets noses and circles their features so it looks like a mask. And when our protagonist a depressive salesman pulls his skin-plates apart in the mirror exposing the mechanics he shares with everyone else he screams. I felt panicked before Anomalisa even began. Synecdoche New York the first of his scripts Kaufman directed is tied for my favorite film of all time. (The 1981 Steve Martin musical Pennies From Heaven shares the top spot and theyre more alike than they sound.) It took Kaufman seven years to direct a second and Id half-hoped he never would. Synecdoche was an ambitious decades-spanning tragicomedy about the entirety of human experience. How do you top that? Related Stories10 Movies You Shouldnt Miss at AFI FestKaufman ever conscious about his own limits doesnt try. Anomalisa deliberately deflates expectations. The plot is small banal anonymous a businessman meets a woman in an Ohio hotel. It could be happening right now. In fact if you scan the bar of the Hyatt Regency Cincinnati it probably is. But even in just one night so ordinary in its small indignities -- wonky keycards awkward bellhops drawn-out room service orders claustrophobia-inducing carpets -- Kaufman builds an emotional world were nervous to enter one were already living in.The man Michael Stone is on a lecture tour for his book about customer service. At first nothing much happens. He endures a skittish airplane seat-mate and chatty cabbie checks into his hotel and apathetically calls his family. The stop motion minutiae is exact to the point that it teeters on the surreal a perfectly hand-carved wall-mounted hairdryer followed by a pictographic phone where hes stumped as to which button orders food. The hamburger? The roast chicken? The drumstick?Of course Kaufmans added a twist. Michael (David Thewlis) speaks with a British growl. But everyone else in his world--his wife his son his concierge his ex-girlfriend--is voiced by the actor Tom Noonan. Noonan adjusts the volume of his speech but otherwise sounds the same no matter who hes playing. This is how Michael a commonplace narcissist sees humanity. Theres him and then the mush of everyone else. If were honest we all have our Michael moments. Kaufman diagnoses humanity but doesnt judge. Michael is cold (the last name Stone is no accident) but also scared of his own coldness. ""Theres something wrong with me"" Michael confesses to his estranged ex Bella. ""Its boring. Everythings boring."" Kaufman agrees that Michaels life is boring. No other director of an animated feature would tick away minutes on the lead character ordering dinner. Yet what Kaufmans really driving at is perception. Michael sees mankind as monotonous. We see Michael as sad privy to the intimacy of this gray-haired man fumbling into his pants. But the other people in Anomalisa must hear their own voices differently--they dont share his ego they have their own. And when Michael panicked by his false face blunders into the hotel room of two saleswomen from Akron Kaufman flips our perception again. The women gasp in delight. Michaels best-selling guide raised their profits 90 percent. To us hes pathetic but to them hes a hero. Then one of the women Lisa speaks and her unique voice (by Jennifer Jason Leigh) sings through the hum. This rare creature can rescue him. Perhaps he hasnt given up on being a romantic hero after all. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Kaufman is pulling on a dozen strings and how they move Michael and Lisa audiences deserve to discover for themselves in the theater. Track his ideas to the top however and hes triggering the same questions he asked in Synecdoche Why do we love some people more than others? Can we truly love anyone if we dont love ourselves? At one point Michael stumbles drunk into an adult toy store to find his boy a gift. He buys a wind-up Japanese sex doll. He gazes at this mechanical geisha which we realize with a shudder has experienced human lust. In this universe its another existential thought experiment How different is Michael the puppet from his purchase? How different are we from him? Kaufman is taking our brains apart and showing us the gears. We still dont know how they work. But reassembling ourselves after the credits roll we might sense both our own fragility and when someones empathy engine fritzes a shared absolution.""Always remember the customer is an individual just like you"" reads Michael to a convention hall of Ohio businessmen. Most filmmakers would make the moment ironic. A few would say its a sermon. Only Kaufman would recognize that this flawed man must keep repeating it to remind himself--just as introverted Kaufman is also doing with his entire movie. Hed never sit us down for a lecture. As Michael sighs ""Sometimes theres no lesson. Thats a lesson in itself."" Instead Kaufman has spent his career trying to explore human behavior giving us his films as our map.

Co-directed by Charlie Kaufman and animation director Duke Johnson the movie boils down Kaufmans penchant for peculiar soul-searching mind trips into their natural state A strange audiovisual journey through a troubled mind thats at once divorced from reality and attuned to its haunting secrets. Unlike many Kaufman screenplays ""Anomalisa"" hits a discombobulating note from the start when it introduces the brightly colored stop-motion universe of motivational speaker Michael Stone (tenderly voiced by David Thewlis). Michael and everyone in his world are dolls whose motion is relatively fluid but their faces show the seams of their construction. Even before it careens into an enigmatic series of twists then ""Anomalisa"" hints at the possibility that Michaels entire existence could collapse at any moment. Adding to that perception the movie utilizes a clever gimmick in its voice cast which features only three actors. The premise comes together fairly quickly On an airplane from Los Angeles to Cincinatti for a speaking gig Michael hears the voice of an old lover named Bella who seems to be a woman but speaks like a man. It doesnt take long to complicate that equation as seemingly everyone Michael encounters speaks with the same monotonous voice (Tom Noonan) from an annoying cab driver to the staff at his hotel -- not to mention his wife and young child whom he calls from his room to check in. Michaels entire world has apparently blended into one boring person. Eager to change things up he calls an old lover and meets her for coffee only to destroy the prospects of reconnecting with an unreasonable proposal. Its around then careening around his hallways of his hotel in a desperate bid for companionship that he finds something different Lisa a fan of Michaels work staying at the hotel in anticipation of his lecture who sounds different from everyone else (shes voiced by Jennifer Jason Leigh). After a few drinks with Lisa and her roommate Michael takes Lisa back to his room -- and thats when his problems give way to the inevitable moment in every Kaufman screenplay when a strange set of circumstances get a whole lot stranger. A disorienting puzzle of a movie with many exhilarating pieces ""Anomalisa"" nevertheless maintains a straightforward trajectory involving Michaels internal strife. As he fights to find a happier direction pursuing an impossible romance while battling surreal nightmares ""Anomalisa"" continues to build its compelling themes. Despite any number of enigmatic ingredients and outrageous twists it undeniably marks the warmest project in Kaufmans oeuvre since ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" another movie about a romantically conflicted man struggling with his own fragile psyche. ""Anomalisa"" also eloquently addresses the sense of being trapped by larger forces beyond any individuals control both in terms of the aging process and society itself. Originally staged as a ""sound play"" for the Theater of a New Ear project in 2005 the movie maintains that setting resulting in a subtle period piece about Bush II-era anxieties. Hints of that time from a first generation iPod to pictures of the sitting president on the wall reach an apex when Michael delivers his sad hilarious speech to baffled spectators near the storys end. As Michael veers through a series of Kafkaesque misadventures at his hotel the value of Kaufmans co-director comes into play Johnson perhaps best-known for a ""Community"" episode made entirely with stop motion helps bring a hyperreal dimension to many scenes. The animation has a tangible quality as if Kaufman were actually playing around with his psychologically troubled dolls and its well-suited to imitate the characters uneasy relationship to his surroundings. Kaufmans script maintains a similarly liquid feel as it veers from deeply weird moments to intimate exchanges. The delectably odd title a nickname Michael creates for Lisa in the midst of seduction epitomizes the way ""Anomalisa"" combines familiar ingredients into a totally fresh blend. Every moment threatens to shift from one tone to another most prominently during a sex scene that could devolve into slapstick at any moment -- but instead reveals something much more touching. Still ""Anomalisa"" is a frequently hilarious inquiry into solipsistic challenges. The author of the amusingly-titled customer service tome ""How May I Help You Help Them?"" Michael seems to have lost track of how to help himself a long time ago. ""Look at what is special about each individual"" he proclaims in his final speech but that registers more like a plea to himself. Yet once ""Anomalisa"" arrives at a point of profound frustration it tags on a sunnier epilogue. If Michael remains trapped in a lonely place its not entirely devoid of hope. Grade A- ""Anomalisa"" premiered this week at the Telluride Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Like all of Kaufmans films which tend to play like Woody Allen movies on hallucinogens it gives us a man in crisis and invites us to enjoy or recoil from his fantasies - or both. Here the stop-motion puppetry adds new wonder soft fluid realistic with just a hint of strangeness meaning that you can see the joins in characters faces like theyre wearing masks. Michael Stone (the voice of David Thewlis) arrives in Cincinnati Ohio to give a speech at a conference of customer-service workers. Kaufman indulges banalities catching a taxi checking in ordering room service a fractured call home to the wife and kid. But as in all Kaufmans films somewhere we leave behind reality and enter the world of Michaels mind. Or at least we experience a mix of the two thats impossible or even unnecessary to unpick. Once unpacked Michael has a nightmare drink at the bar with his troubled ex Bella who he telephones out of the blue. He drinks. He wonders if hes cracking up. He wanders into a sex shop. Back at the hotel he strikes up an out-of-character rapport with a pair of women in town for his talk and spends the night with shy adoring Lisa (the voice of Jennifer Jason Leigh; every other voice in the film is performed by one actor Tom Noonan). Its a blissful island in a sea of troubles. It leads to an astonishingly truthful sex scene - so truthful that maybe only puppets could perform it? Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson quietly probe the biggies happiness disappointment love living with other people mentally hanging on to everyday life by its threads. Its what you imagine might have happened if Kaufman had got his hands on Up in the Air or Lost in Translation. (Perhaps a creepy mechanical Japanese sex doll is a nod to the latter; certainly Kaufman kicks the self-satisfied stuffing out of the former.) Its both soaringly romantic and truly sad. Considering the labyrinthine plotting of Kaufmans Synecdoche New York his only other film as a writer-director this is also strikingly simple. But its no less majestic imaginative or moving.

Kaufman delivers the dark side of a selfish cruel paranoid and confused man who suffers from the Fregoli delusion without sentimentality or apology. it is very stark without being mean spirited. there are a lot of pop culture references - especially with Cyndi Laupers girls Just Wanna Have Fun which refers to Lisas view of life and how she is able to keep enjoying her life and being despite the fact that it is usually her friend who gets the attention.It exposes us to the groupie culture and the desire for self improvement by referring to Lisas story of how they splashed out to stay in the hotel and to make the trip to attend Michaels talk.For Michael it was almost as if he was stuck in the loop of recurring events/reincarnation. a Nietzsche reference perhaps in which he sees the same things keep happening and he needed to escape and there is not one other but the entire universe forming as a oneness against him.I was really looking forward to this film and there were so many moments in the film that left me smiling and laughing remembering the same clumsiness and awkwardness in similar events...People keep referring to it as a puppet film and it is. But it is more real and more human than a lot of the human films that I have seen. It also makes you question which one is real and which one is make believe? Which oen is natural? Lisa having an english-japanese dictionary? Or the fact that Michael was so out of place as a father he bought his child a sex toy as a souvenir?

Tuesday is cheap day So with our membership and 2/1 meerkat it was PS5 for the both us - resultMy partner described Anomalisa as the most depressing film he had ever seen - about the emptiness of human life. I found it less bleak. Artistically its amazing and Id love to know much more about its development - was it always intended to be an animation - if so why why the particular form etc etc.I think the film is worth seeing just because of the amazing visual feat it is. The story and comment on individual self worth and human relationships will probably hit different people in different ways. It definitely wont be everyones thing - and it is quite ambiguous. Overall I would say it is very thought provoking and its unusual form makes it very memorable.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 16 2016Tom HFeaturedWhat a cynical mean-spirited film this is. Charlie Kaufman adopts a sneering attitude to his characters and the audience is invited to do the same laughing as they bumble around have meaningless sex and misunderstand each other. The animation is decent but nothing special and the films perfunctory flight of fantasy goes nowhere interesting. The key message seems to be that Kaufman is smarter and wiser and more insightful than you.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 6 2016MillieMollyMooTastemakerFeaturedThis brilliant tale of normalcy is a great watch. I was lucky enough go to a special screening this week with an introduction by the directors and the producer at The Curzon in Soho. I had no clue about this film as this was the doing of my boyfriend gaining an invite due to his donation to the project on Kickstarter. This is a quirky tale of a man in mid life crisis in his own self loathing and all trapped in his ego and self deprecation. One night he encounters and pursues Lisathe answer to his dreams...surely? The tale tackles a very human moment and told in the most beautiful and odd of ways. In stop motion with dollsbits of 3D printingis born a brilliant and compelling film. Its not here to give you an exciting story or will it give the satisfaction of a happy ending but it makes you think and objectify whilst enjoying the sheer joy of the piece.For fan of Kaufmanyou will not be disappointed with echos of Eternal Sunshine and Malkovitchbut also something entirely unique and a worthy addition to his catalog of films.

Daily Edition Login to download Anomalisa Venice Review 1155 AM PDT 9/5/2015 by David Rooney FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An authentic handmade original. TWITTER Charlie Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson deliver a unique reflection on love pain and loneliness in this animated account of one mans long dark night of the soul pierced by light. Whether in his screenplays for Being John Malkovich Adaptation and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind or his directing debut Synecdoche New York Charlie Kaufmans surreal cerebral chronicles of despair obsession and failure are like nothing else out there. So it was a given that his first animated feature Anomalisa co-directed with stop-motion specialist Duke Johnson was going to be another idiosyncratic entry in a small but wildly distinctive body of work. However that doesnt nearly do justice to the beguiling poignancy and emotional nuance of this funny-sad haunting meditation on depression disguised as a melancholy love story. Funded via Kickstarter and in production for more than two years the material began life as an original ""radio play"" performed in New York and L.A. as part of composer Carter Burwells ""Theater of a New Ear"" project involving Joel and Ethan Coen as well as Kaufman. The one-act works were performed by seated actors reading from scripts with live musical accompaniment by Burwell and sound effects created on the spot by a foley artist. Anomalisa was written by Kaufman under the pseudonym Franco Fregoli. Read more The Danish Girl Venice Review A glance at the Wikipedia page for ""Fregoli delusion"" provides hints as to what Kaufman might be getting at -- in less cryptic fashion than some of his prior works -- with its description of a paranoid disorder in which the sufferer believes that different people are instead one single person out to persecute them who assumes various appearances. Translating a nonvisual performance piece to film might have been challenging but no less than his collaborations with Spike Jonze or Michel Gondry Kaufmans work with Johnson has yielded something quite unique graced by gorgeously plaintive music from Burwell. The naive-style puppet animation has similarities to the Adult Swim series Moral Orel and Mary Shelleys Frankenhole on which Johnson worked as well as his stop-motion animated episode of Community (series creator Dan Harmon is an executive producer here). But theres something more disquieting about these puppets. Their faces look like vintage marionette dolls split into two plates with seams cutting across the eyes and around the hair- and jawlines. And the saggy puffy imperfections of their bodies when we see the two key characters naked are heartbreakingly real. The film opens with a steadily amplified din of overlapping conversation as Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) flies into Cincinnati for a speaking engagement. A Brit living in Los Angeles with his wife and son hes the author of a motivational book on customer service titled How May I Help You Help Them? and a minor celebrity in his field. His darkly funny early interactions with various people -- a seatmate on his flight a chatty cab driver the Fregoli Hotel desk clerk and bellboy -- all suggest his barely contained impatience with their invasive behavior and ingratiating small talk. Kaufman and Johnson create a vivid dismally relatable world here both droll and dreary but fascinating precisely because of its numbing banality. Even the upscale bland modernity of the suite that Michael checks into is observed with sly humor; its an instantly recognizable environment rendered absurd by the directors clarity of vision. And Michaels tired routines -- phone home dial room service practice his speech go down the hall for ice watch a snippet of My Man Godfrey (also animated) on TV -- begin to take on a strange profundity in their bleak ordinariness. Read more Room Telluride Review But antidepressants havent entirely dulled Michaels desire to grasp at a moment of happiness. He tries to reconnect with a local woman Bella Amarossi on whom he walked out 11 years earlier. She has remained single and disappointed and the pathos of her still-bruised feelings is unexpectedly raw. It doesnt end well. All the other characters irrespective of gender age or relationship to Michael are voiced with scarcely modulated delivery by Tom Noonan. The one exception -- or anomaly if you will -- is Jennifer Jason Leigh as Lisa whose voice cuts through hotel walls and brain static to summon Michael out of his martini-dulled torpor and bring him momentarily back to life. Shes a customer service rep for an Ohio baked goods company a dumpy unsophisticated woman with low self-esteem a facial burn scar and a shabby romantic history. ""I play the Jews harp a little"" she offers in one typically awkward getting-to-know-you moment. ""I dont like to say Jews harp because its offensive to Jews."" But during the night they spend together drinking talking singing Cyndi Lauper and getting down to some graphic puppet sex she acquires almost magical qualities causing Michael to believe shes the only other real person in a world where everyone else is just one nightmarish person who wants a piece of him. That fear is illustrated in a priceless dream sequence. Read more Equals Venice Review Clearly anyone familiar with Kaufmans work will know that the idyll with Lisa was never going to last and the spectacular public meltdown that seals its conclusion is weirdly shattering. But as a single-night romantic interlude enriched by infinitely detailed context its a superb set-piece. And like Scarlett Johanssons remarkable voice work in Her Anomalisa provides Thewlis and Leigh with two of the very best roles of their careers. It wouldnt be Kaufman if all the pieces made perfect sense and an antique Japanese mechanized doll that Michael purchases for his son at an erotica emporium (he was directed to a ""toy store"") is an amusing head-scratcher. But this is a wonderfully odd consideration of those questions about love pain solitude and human connection we all ask; its emotional power creeps out from under the subtle humor and leaves a subcutaneous imprint that lingers long after the movie is over. It needs an adventurous distributor to help it extend the Kaufman cult and find the adoring audience it richly deserves.

In ""Anomalisa"" an inspirational speaker in crisis checks into Cincinnatis (fictional) Al Fregoli hotel named for a delusional condition in which paranoiacs believe that those around them are not who they appear to be but a single tormentor hiding behind multiple disguises. Thats a helpful bit of trivia to consider before entering into Charlie Kaufmans latest brainteaser this one originally mounted (just twice) for composer Carter Burwells ""Theater of the New Ear"" sound-play experiment and rescued from obscurity by a team of imaginative producers who thought it might make an interesting stop-motion project -- which it does exceptional even although its unclear just who they imagined might be the audience for such a cerebral cult offering. ""Anomalisas"" existence is a minor miracle on multiple levels from the Kickstarter campaign that funded it (the credits give ""special thanks"" to 1070 names) to the oh-so-delicate way the film creeps up on you transitioning from a low-key dark night of the soul into something warm human and surprisingly tender. This despite the fact that its told entirely through puppets -- which proved to be plenty expressive in ""Being John Malkovich"" the film that put Kaufman on the cinematic map. Now its been seven long years since his directorial debut ""Synecdoche New York"" and Kaufman owes his return at least in part to co-director Duke Johnson (the ""Moral Orel"" helmer who oversaw ""Communitys"" all-stop-motion Christmas episode). Here working on a modest budget with limited sets (an airplane the Al Fregoli and a couple other locations) and just three voice actors Kaufman recovers creative control of an eccentric little project that ultimately manages to move us as deeply as his more ambitious format-melting fare. The connection starts with road warrior Michael Stone (voiced by David Thewlis) touching down in Cincinnati where hes scheduled to give one of his ""How May I Help You to Help Them?"" pep talks before hopping on a plane home the following day. Michael knows his speech inside-out but for some reason the words ring hollow tonight. Hes been thinking about leaving his wife; hes been thinking about Bella the woman he walked out on 11 years earlier. Bella lives in Cincinnati. After settling into his hotel room (have you ever seen a stop-motion puppet use the loo? or gaze out the window to find a man masturbating in the office park across the way?) he gives Bella a call and invites her over. Remember the aforementioned Fregoli syndrome -- that peculiar ailment whose sufferers believe everybodys the same person out to get them? (Fregoli also happens to be the pen name Kaufman used when he first unveiled the play in 2005.) Theres a reason why every time Bella opens her mouth we hear the flat vaguely monotonous sound of Tom Noonans voice. The same thing happens when anybody in ""Anomalisa"" speaks Michaels wife his son the taxi driver or hotel concierge -- all Noonan. Anybody except Lisa that is. Her voice (Jennifer Jason Leighs) cuts through the din and forces Michael out of his room to find its source. Where the film had seemed almost listless in its opening act something clicks when Lisa enters the picture. Theres a liveliness to Leighs voice and its reflected in both her body language and her facial expressions so much as either can be conveyed by these limited-range stop-motion puppets. Michael invites Lisa for a drink dragging her friend Emily (Noonan again) along to the hotel bar. He wants to bring her back to his room where he makes an indecent proposal and she nearly walks out. And then the ice melts and they connect -- over a Cyndi Lauper song of all things. Watching them expect to feel an indescribable mix of affinity and loneliness as only Kaufman can achieve that same ache that accompanied ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" or burned alongside Samantha Mortons smoldering house in ""Synecdoche New York."" What follows is both beautiful and heartbreaking and ultimately unforgettable. Kaufman has done it again writing a deeply flawed male protagonist and a woman who seems so incredibly ideal despite (or perhaps due to) her imperfections and hes engineered it so that we fall in love Michaels gray and overcast Lisa just wants to walk in the sun and for as long as he can make the moment last shes the one. The anomaly. The Anomalisa. Of course that feeling which you never want to end cant go on forever. The movie itself is only 90 minutes and however Joycean may be Kaufmans postmodern spirit he doesnt share ol Sunny Jims belief in epiphanies. Michael experiences such a breakthrough or thinks he does only to have it implode and crumble back into itself in a scene that is so wonderfully Kaufman-esque a chorus of Noonans offering themselves at Michaels feet the death of love the implied womp womp of a sad-trombone ending (not literally of course). In terms of actual music its surprising how little of Burwells music features into ""Anomalisa"" considering that the play was first staged in concert with a live orchestration. Surely this must be one of the typically melancholy composers gentlest scores tinkling away ever so lightly in the background subtly lifting the spirit of an otherwise heavy piece -- much as Leigh does with her voice. So much of the experience relies on listening depending as much on the actors intonations as the words themselves. Naturally the animated format directs our attention to the visual but its best to think of this as a bonus -- and frankly not to be too particular about the technique. Kaufman and Johnson use a form of face-replacement stop-motion not unlike that featured (to far more polished effect) by Laika Studios where the characters faces are split into upper and lower halves and switched out for every frame. The expressions themselves -- brows and jowls -- are generated via color 3D printers which yield a grainy vaguely flesh-toned series of interchangeable masks. For some reason (likely budget though it could also be justified by the films self-conscious nature) the directors opted not to erase the joints in post leaving a conspicuous seam running across the puppets faces at all times. By design Michaels noggin features more color and detail than all the others and beneath those baggy doll clothes they have real rubber bodies which come in handy for what the MPAA has deemed ""graphic nudity"" (this being the org that nearly slapped an NC-17 on ""Team America"" for ""graphic crude and sexual humor violent images and strong language -- all involving puppets""). Working on a fraction of the budget of last years po-mo ""The Lego Movie"" ""Anomalisa"" likewise embraces the limitations of its ""cast"" -- although there are other glitches still to be ironed out including a weird rippling effect that appears across the faces in most scenes. Perhaps the inks werent consistent or maybe slight differences in position between one faceplate and the next bounced the light differently. Whatever the cause the resulting flicker distracts from what we should be looking at -- which is how wonderfully expressive these otherwise rudimentary foot-tall puppets manage to be. As when Wes Anderson dabbled in stop-motion for ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" its a strange medium in which to find a perfectionist. But thats life which ironically Kaufman and company seem to have done a fine job of conjuring in this most artificial of formats.

It makes all movies pale in relation. Gospel. Reply simonandfinn says February 8 2016 at 1044 am My previous comment was worded a bit strongly and I wasnt able to go back and edit it accordingly - I apologize for that. The review was beautifully written but I did want to flag that there are some really interesting interpretations to the film out there. Reply simonandfinn says February 8 2016 at 1038 am I was surprised at the superficiality of this review - there was so much more to this movie much of which can be gleaned from a simple perusal of IMDB comment threads or even watching it carefully and thinking it over. Reply Donald Kaufman says January 2 2016 at 1243 am SPOILER ALERT - I thought it was pretty obvious that Lisa was just in his imagination and he was having a sex fantasy with the Japanese sex toy the whole time (hence the semen at the end) Reply Andy Collen says December 2 2015 at 917 am I was asked by a friend what I thought about Animolisa... Will it go to small indie theaters or big chain? Once you see the movie you will begin to understand my answer and in that you will understand the complications. Indie movie house Yes it is a soul searching film that manages to capture our mundane lives and presents it as a puppet ... through a puppet. Mainstream Theater ( BIG CHAIN) Yes this film grabs the essence of reality and presents us with humor in much the atmosphere of a Jack Black... minus the high octane.
