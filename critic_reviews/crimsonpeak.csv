Entertainment Jessica Chastain Is The Best Part Of ""Crimson Peak"" Guillermo del Toros latest isnt centered on Lady Lucille Sharp but it feels like it should be. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston in Crimson Peak. Universal Pictures ID 7140442 As some disgruntled horror fiends discovered this past weekend Crimson Peak is a movie more interested in channeling a dead genre than in devoting its attention to the menacing specters of the dead that were featured heavily in its marketing campaign. Yes Guillermo del Toros latest does have its ghosts skeletal haunts cloaked in wisps of black or red or white like theyre just keeping their ectoplasmic forms from dispersing in the air. Theyre creepy-pretty the wraiths but theyre around to emerge like triggered video game cutscenes and offer information the movies trembling heroine is too frightened to pick up on.Theyre accessories to the main story of Crimson Peak not the focus because Crimson Peak isnt a horror movie -- its a Gothic romance as Del Toro explained in a ""foreword"" handed out before the movie screened for critics. Though journalists are given press packets all the time theres something about preparing a handout to explain your directorial intentions that feels tantamount to admitting defeat before your film opens. And Crimson Peak -- which is about Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) a girl who can see spirits and Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) the impoverished possibly sinister British aristocrat she falls in love with -- turned out to be a tough sell at the box office. Of course -- its a film geek exercise trying to pass itself off as something more mainstream.The type of movie Del Toro wanted to make isnt extinct -- in fact Wasikowska has become its pallid princess between Cary Fukunagas Jane Eyre and Park Chan-wooks Stoker -- but Del Toro wanted to make a lavish version an ""old-fashioned grand Hollywood production."" His words hint at the self-consciousness that leaves the movie while visually sumptuous detached rather than driven by the swooning emotion for which it aspires. Crimson Peak sometimes feels like the film equivalent of that couple living in an approximation of the Victorian era -- a reenactment rather than something that stands on its own all painstaking details with none of the animation needed to provide a reason for the re-creation.Except when it comes to Jessica Chastain. Halloween costume inspiration ladylucillesharpe CrimsonPeak -- Jessica Chastain (jes_chastain) ID 7140061 Chastain knows full well that she has the most iconic part in Crimson Peak one you could vamp the hell out of at a Halloween shindig -- hair up or in the crown of braids in which she spends most of the movie. Wasikowska in her giant puffed sleeves and Hiddleston with his Byronic hair may be palely picture-perfect together (and even pastier as living characters than they were as members of the undead in Only Lovers Left Alive) but its Chastain as Lucille Sharpe Thomass forbidding older sister who has all of the fun. Its really only when Chastain is onscreen that Crimson Peak snaps into focus and achieves the a functional balance between homage and drama in its own right.Lucille doesnt seem like the kind of gal whos ever laughed in her life but Chastains funny in the part so severe you cant help but snicker. Lucille looks likely to snap in two were she to attempt something like bending at the waist -- buttoned and starched and pulled taut and seething beneath the yards of corsetry. Shes a better embodiment of the dark secrets and repressed emotions with which the story is rife than Edith who by design is a naif and than Thomas who by design is aloof and elusive. She brushes dying butterflies on her face and plays the piano by herself beneath the glowering portrait of the siblings awful mother.Lucille is the madwoman in the attic meets Mrs. Danvers the disturbed housekeeper played best by Judith Anderson in 1940s Rebecca. Chastains performance and the way that shes able to steamroll Wasikowska and Hiddleston two very likable actors leaning hard into their antiquated parts highlights the trouble with what Del Toro has valiantly attempted. Crimson Peak is an effort to make a throwback movie with modern effects and modern sex scenes but it cant contend with the modern gaze with which were looking at it. View this image > Chastain in Crimson Peak. Universal Pictures ID 7147087 Crimson Peak is not revisionist but it feels like it should be because its protagonist is constructed to be so artless and accepting. (Seriously if your new home seeps blood-red mud and has a hole in the roof through which snow is falling run far away.) Edith is the kind of character the story happens to rather than follows. In that it resembles another devotedly old-fashioned movie from earlier this year -- Cinderella.Lucille may be off her rocker but shes also more interesting and she at least has taken charge of her own terrible destiny -- a shadowy reflection of the bright ingenue. In a movie so in love with darkness the fact that shes not more central is a sign that the characters are just as much props as the beautiful set design and the ghosts wandering through it.

The action is set around 1900; it starts in Buffalo New York where a cloistered young writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is swept off her feet by Thomas Spence (Tom Hiddleston) a suave English nobleman whos there on business. Her father disapproves but after his suspiciously sudden death Edith marries Thomas and follows him to his lonely and crumbling castle in Cumberland England where the couple lives with Thomass domineering sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Soon the mysteries of the estate and the familys dark past turn Ediths idyll into a living nightmare; she suspects that her life is in danger. Del Toro builds a tight plot but never develops it; his frames are overdecorated with macabre clutter and smothered in shadow but the atmosphere of dread never reaches ecstatic excesses. The director faces the material with a studious earnestness lavishing more attention on the effects than on the images or the performances. The movie only comes to life at the very end with the inevitable suspense of the sanguinary showdown.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Comments (1) click to enlarge Crimson Peak Recommended Video Rated R  119 minutes  2015 After two fanboy feasts (Hellboy II and Pacific Rim) Guillermo del Toro returns to the arty gothic vibe of his beloved Pans Labyrinth (2006) and while this isnt as haunting its definitely more haunted. A throwback to the woman-in-peril genre it stars Mia Wasikowska as a young heiress in Buffalo New York at the turn of the 20th century whose father is mysteriously and brutally murdered; Charlie Hunnam is a handsome doctor and amateur sleuth looking for answers Tom Hiddleston is the dashing entrepreneur who swoops in to marry the heroine and Jessica Chastain is his creepy lip-curling sister. The father returns as a bloody beast with his skull caved in and the heroines mother keeps bursting into the room as a charcoal-blackened wraith but the real wonder is the sumptuous production design by Thomas E. Sanders whose darkly colorful sets were inspired by Stanley Kubricks The Shining. By J.R.

There are lots of excellent movies in theaters right now and more on the way so it helps simplify matters to have a movie out there you can feel really great about missing. In fact do it tonight Take off your shoes sit back in a cushy chair and concentrate on the fact that at that very moment other people are watching ""Crimson Peak"" and youre not. Youll feel warm all over. As for the poor souls who cant take warning they will be suffering through a long strangely uninteresting combination of latter-day Jane Austen and just plain disgusting. Director Guillermo del Toro has a penchant for the physically repulsive -- hes like David Cronenberg but lacking the one element that guides and redeems Cronenbergs vision genuine neurosis. Del Toro just goes for effect and the effect he seems to be going for here is something like ""Ew Guillermo thats really gross."" When we first meet our heroine Edith (Mia Wasikowska) she has a gash in her cheek and her hands and face are splashed with blood. ""Ghosts are real"" she announces in voice-over. A minute later we meet our first ghost a black skeleton in an elaborate black dress and with long leathery tapered black fingers. Shes attacking a little girl in her bed. This notion of ghosts having decomposing flesh marks Guillermo as unclear on the concept of ghosts. Then again as no one has ever thrown up at the sight of Casper (the friendly ghost) some innovation was necessary. Ghost incidents continue to haunt Ediths young life. Indeed every time shes alone and relaxed theres a weird grinding or groaning sound and before she knows it a red naked thing half covered in flesh and with big holes in its skull is coming up through the floorboards and charging at her. But heres whats funny or unintentionally funny No matter how many times this occurs she never thinks to say to someone ""Hey guess what happened to me today"" Shes remarkably capable of putting these incidents out of her mind. In one notable example less than an hour after a ghost attack she shows up at a dress ball with a young baronet and by the time the partys over you get the feeling she considers it as an on-balance good night. Sure a supernatural entity of blood-curdling ugliness materialized but she did some dancing had a few laughs. ... Life is good. ""Crimson Peak"" is set around the turn of the last century. Edith is an upper-class American girl and her father (Jim Beaver) is one of the important men of the town. Father takes an instant dislike to the handsome English lord (Tom Hiddleston) who is courting his daughter and he doesnt much like the lords weird sister Lady Lucille played with big-eyed unblinking intensity by Jessica Chastain. Needless to say Edith is soon married to the lord and living in a mansion in England that is so run-down that it snows in the house. Theres a 10-foot gash in the roof. But no one sees this as a deal breaker or particularly unusual including possibly the filmmakers. ""Crimson Peak"" drags along for most of its running time assuming an audience engagement that it cant inspire. Something is building some plan is afoot but its difficult to care what it might it be. The only real question of interest is what Chastain is doing here and why she chose a second-banana part. This question is answered at about midway. Shes the only one in the cast who gets to have any fun. Watching Chastain channel her inner Joan Crawford is no reason to see ""Crimson Peak"" but the spectacle of a generous and abandoned actress going for broke makes the last half almost bearable.

Jason Gorber Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 16 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 16 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Guillermo del Toro Written by Guillermo del Toro Matthew Robbins Starring Mia Wasikowska Jessica Chastain Tom Hiddleston Classification 14A Country USA Language English Guillermo del Toros latest dive into the darkness is a sumptuous beautifully constructed tale that feels both archaic and inviting.Shot with a sanguine palette the film unfolds like the contraption in del Toros 1993 film Chronos with intricate mechanical devices or looming archways framing and constraining the characters. Performances by Tom Hiddleston Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain are perfectly in keeping with the tone of the piece providing a sombre aloofness that may grate on some.For those willing to delve into this strange world though theres lots to gain from small moments shared between the characters be it the brushing of candle-lit hands during a waltz or glances of conspiracy between siblings. Its also refreshing to see the gender dynamic of the Victorian era upended in engaging ways.Production design is often the hallmark of a del Toro film and the world of 19th-century Buffalo as well as the throbbing red muck surrounding the films central edifice are beautifully realized.It may take some suspension of disbelief to get into the mood but for audiences open to its charms Crimson Peak is enthralling.

He paints them dreams them shapes them into private fantasies. His 2007 fantasy Pans Labyrinth won the Mexican director a slew of awards. And his visionary style is again readily apparent in Crimson Peak a ghost story in which superior camerawork costumes and production design work together to put the audience in a trance. Its tough on actors not to get swallowed up in the scenery.

Luckily del Toro has brought on a competitive bunch. Tom Hiddleston -- yes Loki himself -- stars as British baronet Thomas Sharpe a smooth operator who is heiress hunting in Buffalo New York at the turn of the 20th century. He hits paydirt with the virginial Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska). Prep for chills as he whisks her off to Crimson Peak his haunted family castle in England ruled by Thomas twisted sister Lucille (a deliciously demented Jessica Chastain). This brother and sister are clearly not to be trusted which sometimes leads the movie in material more appropriate for a campy spoof. As for the crumbling mansion its a doozy built on clay the color of blood and filled with portents culled from every scary movie del Toro and the rest of us have made the stuff of our nightmares. Too much? Of course. But watching del Toro explode this Gothic romance with beauty and terror is part of the fun.

I was close to hating it as I walked out of the theater but images and moments from it have stayed with me. 380 Shares Share 346 Tweet 29 Share 5 Share Email Print Share Photo Universal Pictures ""Ghosts are real"" are the first words uttered in Guillermo del Toros pseudo-Gothic pseudo-horror pseudo-romance fever dreamA Crimson Peak. Not long after that we see our heroine aspiring author Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) explain a short story shes written to a prospective publisher. ""Its not a ghost story"" she assures him. ""More a story with ghosts in it. Ghosts are a metaphor for the past."" One doesnt need to read too much into the movie to understand that del Toro intends that as his own statement of artistic principle as well. But thats both the problem and the wonder ofA Crimson Peak It features lots of ghosts but isnt really a ghost story. It speaks a lot about romance but isnt really a romance. It gives us the structure of a mystery yet has very little mystery in it. It isnt even all that haunted by the past despite that whole line about ghosts as metaphors. It doesnt always seem to know what it wants to be. But its still full of marvels. When we first meet her Edith (her last name likely a nod to the great Peter Cushing star of many classic Hammer horror films -- a key Crimson influence) is an outspoken independent young woman living in Buffalo New York frustrated by the fact that whenever she tries to get her work published her gender gets in the way of her being taken seriously. One day however into her workplace walks Baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who immediately takes an interest in one of her stories. (His glance at her first page is so quick however that it seems clear he couldnt possibly have read anything.) An engineer with a mind for elaborate inventions hes dreamy and sensitive and haunted. He also has a sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) whos bolder and tougher than he is who has very little time for social niceties. The English Sharpes are the toast of Buffalo society but Ediths banker father (Jim Beaver) sees through them -- to their outdated dusty clothes to their nervousness. He can tell these purported nobles are at the end of their rope and he takes the Sharpes to be irresponsible moochers. Unfortunately Dads opinion becomes a nonissue soon enough and Edith follows her heart heading with Thomas to Allerdale Hall the rambling decaying Cumberland mansion beside which the Sharpes mine for the bloodred clay that seeps through their basement like an insistent heartbeat. And well lets just say things go downhill from there. As a narrative Crimson Peak feels both saggy and impoverished -- which must be some sort of accomplishment since stories tend to sag under the weight of too much incident or too many loose ends not their own emptiness. And for better or worse del Toro doesnt seem interested in telling a story here He doesnt complicate his setup or give us any turns to keep us interested along the way. Its not that the story is predictable its that the story cant even bother to be predictable. Del Toro may be harkening back to Gothic romances Hammer horror and Roger Cormans Poe films but those stories found ways to surprise us even as they indulged in genre conventions. Here it all feels woefully predetermined. (One big revelation at the end is so obvious that its probably not even fair to call it a revelation.) Theres an imbalance in the performances too. Wasikowska gives Edith a plucky forthright charm at first but as her character becomes more and more a vessel for us to explore the world of the Sharpes and Allerdale Hall she shrinks as a presence -- in part because she spends so much of the movie horrified or sick or outraged. Beautiful soulful Hiddleston does what he can with the wan Thomas but the fact that del Toro cant seem to write men gets in the way; I was constantly reminded of the experience of watching Pacific Rim and realizing that the film should have centered on Rinko Kikuchis story all along. Speaking of Pacific Rim Charlie Hunnam is here too playing an adoring friend of Ediths who makes way for Thomas and he seems about as lost here as he did in the earlier film. Chastain on the other hand acts literal and figurative circles around everyone else -- ruthless yet passionate her Lucille is an animalistic physical force. She owns the films final act and her energy lifts the movie up -- but it also makes everyone else seem paler and smaller. Crimson Peak is a fascinating conundrum of a movie. I was close to hating it as I walked out of the theater but images and moments from it have stayed with me. I keep thinking about the designs of the ghosts Edith keeps seeing with little ribbons of skin floating off them into the ether. I keep thinking about the characters billowing robes as they sprint through the crumbling mansions halls. I keep thinking about that gushing gory blood-soaked finale - not so much in what happens in it so much as the gushing-gory-blood-soaked-ness of it all. Maybe del Toro doesnt give us depth. But what he does give us is atmosphere color texture and whirlwind camera moves. You can lose yourself in the films spaces in the characters costumes; hell you can lose yourself in their hair. The film is so rich visually that you kind of forget about its revoltingly underbaked story after a while. Crimson Peak is not so much Gothic as it is Baroque; its artistry lies in its excessive ornamentation. That wont be enough for some. And for others it will be everything.

"Crimson Peak | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; crimson-peak ) Crimson Peak (United States 2015) October 16 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Crimson Peak works as an homage to 19th century gothic literature. Beyond that mission statement however it has trouble gaining traction. Although the film may hold a certain appeal for those who have spent long hours thumbing through the pages of The Picture of Dorian Gray Northanger Abbey Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights its deficiencies make it at best an atmospheric triumph with a weak narrative. Director Guillermo del Toros unique visual style is on display but the story is predictable the characters are flat and the supernatural elements are red herrings. To paraphrase a character this isnt so much a ghost story as it is a ""story with ghosts."" And they serve little purpose beyond making this appropriate for Halloween viewing. Crimson Peak boasts a strong cast with Mia Wasikowska as the virginal innocent Edith Cushing; Thors Loki Tom Hiddleston as Thomas Sharpe Ediths Rochester; and Jessica Chastain as the somewhat unhinged Lucille Sharpe. The cracks in the narrative foundation have little to do with the actors or their performances but with the characters they portray. Theres not much psychological complexity to these people; their actions feel scripted and they never attain three dimensionality. Were never fully invested in the story because we know where its going. Del Toro throws in a couple of minor twists and turns but little that happens during the course of Crimson Peak is going to surprise anyone with even a cursory familiarity with the gothic genre. Crimson Peak opens in 19th century Buffalo where Edith lives in an old house with her protective widowed father Carter (Jim Beaver). Edith is a writer of gothic stories with little affinity for romance or sentimentality. She believes in ghosts having encountered the haggard spirit of her mother. (This scene presented in flashback offers one of the films most unsettling images.) Ediths world-view changes with the arrival of Thomas an English baronet with whom she falls madly in love. Thomas an affable gentleman seeking financing for an invention can rarely be found without his emotionally frosty sister Lucille. Carter is immediately suspicious of Thomas and once he learns of a secret in the mans past he issues an ultimatum that the baronet leave Buffalo immediately. Carters murder however puts an end to his efforts to stem the romance between Edith and Thomas; they are married and move to his sprawling crumbling mansion in the north of England where spirits haunt the darkened hallways and the presence of a red mineral in the soil turns the snow scarlet. Visually Crimson Peak is a special film with an aesthetic matched by few (if any) modern horror movies. Perhaps only Tim Burton could lay claim as distinctive a style. From the vast foyer of the mansion with its wrecked ceiling and arching staircase to the way the ghosts scuttle through the halls before merging with the shadows Crimson Peak is a treat for the eyes. The title hue suffuses the screen occasionally making it seem as if the proceedings are drowning in blood. Theres an element of creepiness in Del Toros approach but little thats truly frightening. To his credit the director doesnt rely on jump scares preferring instead to allow dread to build. Alas the ghosts have little tangible purpose. They are an unnecessary appendage to a story that could unfold unaltered without them. The narrative is regurgitated gothic melodrama. Crimson Peak captures and holds the attention because of how it looks not because its telling a compelling tale. The overall arc is so familiar that its almost tempting to view this as a parody although the tone would argue against that interpretation. Admittedly part of the productions charm is that it hews closely to the conventions of the gothic genre but opportunities to be more creative are bypassed in favor of crafting a straightforward homage. There are things to like about Crimson Peak but although the level of technical accomplishment matches that of Del Toros Pans Labyrinth this is neither as imaginative nor as satisfying a journey into the realms of the strange and supernatural as some of the directors more memorable outings.

Every moment is infused with as much drama as possible; as Lucille spoons sugar into the tea she scrapes it along the rim towards Edith with what can only be described as murderous intent. Thats the kind of movie Crimson Peak is Del Toro wont let a scene pass without smashing the audience in the face with it but you cant help but admire his audacity.Related Story The Enduring Creepiness of Haunted-House Films The director has shied away from describing Crimson Peak as a horror film though it contains many ghosts a few jump scares and as many suspenseful creaks and groans as can fit in its two-hour running time. Instead hes billed it as a ""Gothic romance"" in the vein of Alfred Hitchcocks Rebecca or George Cukors Gaslight. In terms of dialogue and acting the film certainly has that 1940s Old Hollywood style The dialogue is either nakedly emotional or thuddingly symbolic and the eventual plot twists are easy to get. Though Crimson Peaks tone is arch enough that it wont be for everyone theres definitely a gory beating heart at its core.The characters are straight out of a romance novel. Edith is the plucky heroine an aspiring novelist patronized at every turn by 19th-century misogyny; her only defender is her industrialist father (Jim Beaver) who meets a nasty and suspicious end when he objects to her new suitor the penniless English lord Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). Thomas whisks Edith off to his family home a crumbling manse nicknamed Crimson Peak that is without hyperbole the most-haunted house in the history of the world.It has a good half-dozen ghosts rendered in sinewy CGI with much dripping blood and exposed muscle creeping and shrieking around at night for Edith to fret over. Its built over a scarlet clay mine so it looks like blood is literally seeping from the walls and floorboards. Theres a creepy basement filled with locked suitcases a shuddering elevator a secret attic and Thomass brooding sister Lucille whose idea of hospitality is bursting into the room with a tea tray any time Edith gets too close to her newlywed husband.The houses many secrets are easy to lay bare and Edith quickly sets about revealing them. Edith is being gaslit certainly as Thomas and Lucille try to convince her that shes going mad and simply imagining all the ghosts who clank around night after night. But in a twist on the Gothic formula shes got the fortitude to see past their assurances and stick up for herself. She also has a nice-guy suitor from back home in Buffalo a doctor named Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) who shows up trying to rescue her and mostly does a terrible job of it. In an older movie Alan would be the strapping hero; here hes a bit of a doof though a well-meaning one.Thomas and Lucille for all the secrets theyre carrying are also more tragic antiheroes than full-on villains although Chastain plays Lucilles jealous intensity to the hilt. Her accent is wobbly but her death stare is not; shes matched in ferocity by the costume and production design from the house itself (built in its entirety by the art director Thomas E. Sanders and stuffed with detail) to the many many gowns. Del Toro whos made some great gore-fests in the past also includes some shocking violence just to keep nerves extra frayed.Crimson Peak will not be for everyone. Its a gratuitous film and proudly so from the performances on down If your reaction to a haunted house with non-stop bleeding walls is ""that sounds like a bit much"" then everything else may end up feeling similarly on the nose. But its swooning emotion is consistent if nothing else and builds to a marvelous crescendo with the final showdown both in terms of thrills and pathos. To say more would be to spoil but Del Toro certainly knows not to let any of his characters bid adieu without an on-the-nose monologue and extreme jab of violence. Now thats a talent to die for.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Kerry Hayes/Courtesy of Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Kerry Hayes/Courtesy of Universal Pictures Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) seduces Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) in Crimson Peak. Kerry Hayes/Courtesy of Universal Pictures The title of Guillermo Del Toros luxuriant gothic romance Crimson Peak refers to the viscous red clay that burbles to the surface at an isolated British estate -- which in the wintertime looks like the landscape itself is bleeding out. That Del Toro the genre maestro behind The Devils Backbone Pans Labyrinth and Pacific Rim essentially chose to name his movie after a bold stylistic conceit says a lot about his willingness to allow its surface pleasures to become a dominant force. And while he and his co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins perfume the air with a fittingly ornate tale of forbidden love and family secrets Crimson Peak wants nothing more (or less) than to immerse the audience in the splendors of Victorian horror. For comparisons sake the only semi-recent major studio film to attempt anything like Crimson Peak is Francis Ford Coppolas Bram Stokers Dracula which committed the bulk of its creative energy to the gothic effects of matte paintings old-fashioned camera techniques and a thundering soundtrack. The deficiencies of Coppolas film -- the variable performances the awkward (if devoted) commitment to Stoker -- are not as pronounced in Del Toros but its an equally confident feat of direction with style becoming the substance more than merely overwhelming it. This is a world of satin dresses and ruffled lace of candelabra and skeleton keys of secret passageways and wellsprings of blood. Merely occupying it for two hours is its own best justification. The referential games begin with the last name of its heroine Edith Cushing (hat tip to Peter) first seen as a little girl getting a visitation from the ghost of her late mother who warns her to ""beware of the Crimson Peak."" Fourteen years later in turn-of-the-century Buffalo Edith (Mia Wasikowska) seeks to convert this supernatural encounter into a career in fiction but shes caught up in a love triangle between Alan (Charlie Hunnam) an earnest local and Thomas (Tom Hiddleston) a mysterious and alluring British engineer. A dashing romantic nursing an impossible dream Thomas has come to Buffalo to persuade Ediths father to invest in his clay-digging machine but when that deal goes south and her father dies under suspicious circumstances Edith follows Thomas back to his majestic but crumbling family estate. Once there she gets roped into a peculiar relationship between Thomas and his considerably less welcoming sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) and soon she uncovers some unsavory truths about the siblings and their creepy mansion. Del Toro and Robbins dont work hard enough to obscure the not-so-shocking revelations that follow -- and Del Toros continued casting of Hunnam dead weight here as in Pacific Rim is perplexing -- but its only necessary that the plotting be as purposefully decorous as the production design. Crimson Peak follows some of the tropes of elegant haunted house movies like The Innocents but the vibrant colors recall everything from the Italian horror of Mario Bava to the run of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations that Roger Corman directed in the early 60s. Past Del Toro fantasies like Pans Labyrinth and The Devils Backbone served a larger allegorical purpose such as channeling the terrors of childhood or war but Crimson Peak is more fully ensconced in the universe it conjures. In other words its purely a feat of direction though having Chastain around to wield a teaspoon like an ax against the grindstone certainly gives the film a boost. Though Crimson Peak sends a few expertly timed chill waves up and down the spine its more a dark gothic romance than an out-and-out scare machine. Del Toro isnt working within any familiar modern horror conventions -- Bram Stokers Dracula was released over 20 years ago -- but doing the hard work of bringing the past into the present. The gargantuan CGI effects of Pacific Rim have been replaced here by a more sinewy and elegant form of digital brushwork like unstable apparitions that break up into black curls and vapors or the lava flows of red clay that slide down the walls. For genre mavens the experience is like witnessing the revival of a lost art form.

Oh yeah. But if you like this kind of thing too much is never enough. Yet like most buffets Guillermo del Toros film tries to make up for what it lacks in nutritional value with extra sauce and side dishes. Its a horror film a Gothic romance and most of all a sumptuous feast of lurid sumptuous images. You dont watch this movie you feel it as youre drawn into its blood red colors and atmospheric delights. You dont worry about whether its good for you until long after youve left the table.The film begins in 1901 in Buffalo N.Y. a damp and dismal place that is home to self-made industrial titan Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) and his daughter Edith (Mia Wasikowska). She wants to be a writer yet her insistence on writing about ghosts at the expense of romance makes her a tough sell at least as long as potential publishers know her gender. Its an interest she comes by honestly; she received a ghastly visit from her recently deceased mother as a child and as we learn from her in a framing voiceover ""Ghosts are real. This much I know.""AZCENTRALGuillermo del Toro goes Gothic in Crimson PeakEdith is at her fathers office one day working on one of the new typewriting machines (del Toros fascination with mechanical objects shouldnt be overlooked) when British baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) arrives hoping to secure her father as an investor in his mining machine. Edith has so far rebuffed the advances of childhood-friend-become-doctor Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) but Thomas intrigues her. She also doesnt care much for the social scene of the time but she reluctantly attends a party and in one of the films best scenes dances a waltz with Thomas without extinguishing the candle held between them -- all while Thomas cold remote sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) glowers even while providing accompaniment on piano.Its all heading where we think Thomas wants to marry Edith but Cushing is no more open to this idea than he is the mining machine. A private detective turns up dirt on the Sharpes but before we learn what it is tragedy strikes and the next thing you know newlyweds Edith and Thomas arrive in England at the isolated crumbling pile his family has called home for centuries -- family that to Ediths dismay includes the less-than-welcoming Lucille.AZCENTRALPhoenix Arizona Movie Theaters Showtimes ReviewsThe mansion sits atop red clay that seeps through its walls making it look as if it is bleeding. The locals call it Crimson Peak because the clay seeps up through the snow in winter making it run blood red. Charming place in other words particularly with Lucille skulking about offering Edith a constant pot of tea. Its a throwback to the Hammer studio films of the 1950s and 60s (""Horror of Dracula"" ""The Curse of Frankenstein"") and a good one.Its also filled with ghosts which seem to be warning Edith of ... what? Imminent danger certainly but del Toro who co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins plays close to the vest with details. Thats a good thing because the build-up is far more effective than the payoff. Once the movie is over its clear the story isnt really that scary especially with so many ghosts hanging around and a little thin. But if the film is ultimately an exercise in atmosphere it is without question a triumph on that front. The rich textures and almost tactile visuals are astonishing. Hiddleston is right at home playing a charming man with a darker edge (Loki in evening dress) and Wasikowska makes a convincing sort of proto-feminist. Chastain probably has the most fun chewing more scenery as the movie progresses. By that time like at any buffet worth its salt youre stuffed.And still want to go back for seconds.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebookfacebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Guillermo del Toros overblown spookfest combines an outstanding cast intricate production design and sumptuous costuming worthy of a museum exhibit into a creepy trifle. This gothic horror opus is melodrama most foul and I mean that in terms of concept and execution as well. The film combines the gloomy aesthetics of ""Wuthering Heights"" the apparitions family secrets and betrayals of ""The Woman in Black"" with the murderous straight razor chills of ""Sweeney Todd."" The remix of period pieces transports us back to an era when hotblooded passion and violence exist in societies where absolute coldblooded decorum rules. This is the kind of overly ambitious story that could be imagined by Mia Wasikowskas character Edith Cushing a wealthy New York heiress and aspiring author of the late 19th century. Chilled by seeing her late mothers doleful spirit as a child she tells us in the opening voiceover ""Ghosts are real. This I know."" She matures as the most beautiful wallflower in the upstate gentry. Edith prefers to read and write tales in the manner of Mary Shelley and Arthur Conan Doyle rather than engage in romantic pursuits. Ediths interest is awakened by the arrival of Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) an insolvent English nobleman seeking an American investor in his dwindling mine operation. Her highly moral father (played by character actor Jim Beaver with all the believable endearing zest of golden age Gene Hackman) calls the new arrival ""little Lord Fauntleroy"" yet Edith finds the handsome aristocrat all but irresistible. At a formal gala he invites her to learn the waltz as his partner. Its a gorgeously executed scene. A throng of splendidly attired extras are thrilled to watch the pas de deux whirl. Viewers can join in as the partners are clearly connecting over every exquisite step. There are some bloodcurdling reversals but he soon transports his new bride to his ancestral home. Like a vision from a Wes Anderson bad drug trip Allerdale Hall is a remote frigid wreck the sort of thing you flee on sight. The same could be said of Sir Thomas older sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Her steady scowl and thin-lipped smile suggest that after serving tea she will move on to ritualistic slaughter. Del Toro uses unconventional candelabra-lighted interiors and heightened operatic acting to build tension drip by drip. Chastains performance delivers the goods all right. She is so mad-dog no-holds-barred hog-wild intense you could think shes going to have a heart attack in every scene. As images of wraiths and lost infants invade Ediths room and mind she nears cardiac arrest too. Universal Mia Wasikowska is an author/heiress haunted by ghosts in ""Crimson Peak."" Del Toro advances the eerie love story at a Victorian pace. While early scenes prepare us to expect supernatural gloom and doom he deliberately moves his visually imaginative saga ahead at a creeping pace. He piles on voyeuristic treats including an unapologetically wicked bedroom scene exposing Hiddleston at impressive length. Mostly we wait to stop waiting. The looming kinetic jolts dont arrive until late in the fifth act at which point the movie is so vast and unwieldy that you half-expect the gargantuan sets to just topple over at any second. While Del Toro and his cast clearly enjoy dabbling in historical hellfire the film stumbles across unbelievable twists like a Mardi Gras drunk. Would a person being slowly murdered record the lethal plot to be replayed on an Edison cylinder phonograph? Would the evildoers allow that evidence to sit for years in an unlocked closet? Can ghosts be imprisoned in jailhouse-style cells? Can one run away from a killer for great distance despite having a broken leg? How much blood-red liquid can fill the basement of a mansion seep up through the floors and drip down across the walls before a family decides to abandon its home and move elsewhere? And most important are you vigilant about straight razors butcher knives and meat cleavers when you marry into a family named Sharpe? So is ""Crimson Peak"" a heinous atrocity or an epic catastrophe? Trick question. Its both. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Crimson Peak reviewed Guillermo Del Toros haunted-house horror film is gothic in every sense of the word.

By Dana Stevens Mia Wasikowska as Edith Cushing in Crimson Peak. Photo by Kerry Hayes. Image courtesy of Universal Pictures. The word gothic has a long and conceptually twisty history in English. The Goths were one of many Germanic peoples who invaded the Roman empire around the third century and for centuries afterward their name was a synonym for barbaric warlike or crude behavior. (Shakespeare plays on these two meanings in the first scene of Titus Andronicus when a character who is an actual Goth looks back with longing at a time ""when Goths were Goths."") In the 17th century the word gothic became associated with Teutonic culture more generally eventually providing the name for a style of medieval architecture that originated in northern Europe. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. By the late 18th century gothic had also come to stand for an emerging genre of popular fiction with medieval romantic or supernatural themes One element common to such novels was the central presence of an ancient dilapidated and often haunted house. And finally sometime in the mid-1980s the word took on its most recent sense A goth became a disaffected young person in black eyeliner who listened to the Cure and dressed in fashions that evoked the languid heroes and heroines of those long-ago novels--Victorian lace-up boots tattered velvet jackets jewelry suggestive of the occult. I may appear to be browsing the shelves at the local Hot Topic this style says for its wearer but really Im gazing off the parapet of a ruined castle awaiting the return of my one impossible love. Advertisement Guillermo del Toros Crimson Peak brings together all those meanings of gothic. The human characters engage in plenty of crude barbaric and warlike behavior planting hatchets in each others skulls and bashing one anothers faces against ... ugh never mind. Much of the film takes place in an enormous and impressively dilapidated mansion--complete with pointy medieval turrets--thats inhabited by a growing population of unquiet souls. The protagonist Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is a classic gothic heroine A prim fiction-scribbling spinster shes seduced away from her desk by a suspiciously ardent English aristocrat named Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). And the lavish production and costume design--especially as regards Thomas sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) a spectral brooder who appears to be modeling Hot Topics new line of haute couture--are as goth as it gets. For the two hours it lasted I wasnt asking any questions only giggling squirming screaming and swooning. Is Crimson Peak nothing but a play of richly colored and textured surfaces so fixated on establishing mood and atmosphere that the script (by del Toro and Matthew Robbins) neglects to develop minor elements like character story and theme? That I suspect is the question that will divide this movies viewers into camps. Personally Im pitching my tent on the ""pro"" side (while conceding that the haters across the way have some valid points). A fellow critic who professed to ""adore"" the movie tweeted that watching it felt like ""sinking stoned into a beanbag chair on a long night out with the best-looking lit-class kids ever."" Though my admiration for it stopped short of adoration Crimson Peaks effect on me was similarly drug-like. For the two hours it lasted I wasnt asking any questions only giggling squirming screaming and swooning. The giggle-scream is a particularly pleasurable confluence of movie-theater emotions. Sam Raimi is a master at eliciting it as are Bong Joon-Ho and the early (pre-Tolkien) Peter Jackson. Theyre not above sending up horror conventions--self-turning doorknobs false-alarm jump scares sudden bursts of over-the-top gore--even as they freely avail themselves of those conventions reliable effect on the audience. Del Toros teasing attitude toward viewer expectations draws on this tradition but he also plays some deeper cuts from the history of horror cinema. The sets of Allerdale Hall the comically decrepit mansion where the Sharpe siblings set out to mess with Ediths head (or is she just going crazy?) could have come straight from the cobweb-draped soundstages of Britains Hammer studio. Even Ediths last name is an apparent salute to Peter Cushing Hammers longtime Van Helsing. Also coursing through Crimson Peaks veins is genetic material from Orson Welles Alfred Hitchcock Edgar Allan Poe and the Bronte sisters (both Charlotte and Emily). Del Toro and his cinematographer Dan Laustsen take evident delight in weaving together references to their cultural progenitors often using old-school camera transitions like irises or wipes. But for all its playfulness Crimson Peak isnt just a well-crafted pastiche of earlier works. It also feels in small but important ways like something new. One place this novelty shows up is in the importance given to the conflict between female characters. Without giving too much of the story away I can say that Crimson Peak becomes as much about the rivalry between a woman and her spooky sister-in-law as it is about the romance between that woman and her slippery new husband. It doesnt hurt that the womens climactic showdown unfolds on a vast expanse of snow soaked through with a viscous bright-red liquid--not blood but the mineral-rich red clay that gives this fictional landscape and the movie its name. That thick scarlet goo is the unsung star of Crimson Peak flowing with unsettling slowness down walls and bubbling eerily in underground vats. (The glorious production design is by Thomas E. Sanders.) But Jessica Chastain gives the scene-stealing ooze a run for its money. Shes had to play a supportive trouper in too many consecutive roles helping Matt Damon get home from Mars or helping Matthew McConaughey get home from Gargantua (where hes escaping ... Matt Damon). Its with relish that Chastain transforms into the morbid and delusional Lucille treading the creaky floorboards of Allerdale Hall with a cameo brooch at her throat and a forbiddingly large ring of house keys at her waist. Chastains performance all masterfully controlled facial tics and smoldering rage approaches camp without losing sight of her characters humanity. Lucille Sharpe may be a deeply damaged woman but she has the courage of her (twisted) convictions. The frail yet indomitable Wasikowska is just right in the Joan Fontaine role of a naive young bride slowly discovering shes been had. And Tom Hiddleston tall pale and hollow-cheeked is the man of every would-be ghosts dreams. If he invited you to live in his decaying ancestral home youd go even if the house was located atop a reservoir of seething bright-red liquid that seemed unnervingly symbolic of ... something. One sizable complaint about Crimson Peak For a film made by one of cinemas great creature-imaginers its ghosts are not all that scary. With their flayed skin and long pointy fingers theyre not what youd ideally want to see on the other side of a slowly opening door but they lack the nightmarish specificity of earlier del Toro creations like the horrific Pale Man of Pans Labyrinth. Part of the problem may be simply that these ghosts are digitally rendered; eerie as they may look they never have the distinctive individuality of a character played by a human actor (like del Toro favorite Doug Jones who lent his graceful shape to both Pale Man and the fish-man Abe Sapien of the Hellboy films). Nor do Crimson Peaks ghosts really serve to embody the characters inner states in the manner of say the title character of last years breakout horror film The Babadook. ""The ghosts are just metaphors"" Edith assures a prospective publisher of her horror manuscript early in the film. But the ones she encounters later on are even less substantial than that. Theyre decorative elements supernatural throw pillows scattered around the gargantuan fixer-upper that is Allerdale Hall. Once youve fallen under Crimson Peaks spell though--if you do fall--the relative insignificance of the ghost-story subplot hardly matters. Its the raw struggle for power and love among the human characters and the swoonily phantasmagoric atmosphere in which that conflict unfolds that takes you back to a time--or a few different times--when Goths were Goths. Correction Oct. 15 2015 This article originally misidentified Peter Cushing as Hammers longtime Dracula. He was Hammers longtime Van Helsing. (Return.)

Though it terrified me as an eight-year-old when I first went on it as an adult its a wonderful mix of silliness and the macabre. It doesnt take itself seriously but its also got a genuinely creepy edge hiding beneath the goofy ghosts and cheesy effects. Crimson Peak in theatres Friday is a gothic romance set in a haunted mansion. But even though its from master director (and current Toronto resident) Guillermo del Toro who invented the wonderful worlds of Pans Labyrinth Hellboy and Pacific Rim its not particularly creepy nor all that emotional nor even (deliberately) silly. Like a theme park attraction its a giant intricate contraption thats utterly amazing to look at. But ultimately its rather a dull ride. When charming but mysterious English baron Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) arrives in early 20th-century New York hes ostensibly seeking funding for a contraption that will help him mine the rich red clay beneath his family estate in England. Instead he leaves with the heart of the whip-smart and wilful Edith (Alice in Wonderlands Mia Wasikowska) who follows him back to the misty moors of Cumberland and her new husbands ancestral home with its leaking ceilings crumbling floors and walls that ooze red goo. But an uneasy triangle develops between Thomas Edith and Thomass unsmiling unblinking sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) who clearly has plans for her brothers sweet young bride. And the estate itself - nicknamed Crimson Peak for the way the clay in the ground stains the winter snow a bloody red - is chockablock with restless spirits. Crimson Peak is an homage to the classic Hammer horrors of the 50s and 60s - heck Ediths last name is Cushing a not-so-subtle nod to Hammer Film legend (and later Star Wars villain) Peter Cushing - and as such its meant to be rather broad and arch. But its tough to say if modern audiences will understand what del Toro is riffing on here or even whether he does it successfully. And the Hammer films were reinventing horror in their heyday not recycling it. While Crimson Peak showcases del Toros incredible visual toolset - the man knows colour better than just about any other living director - it wedges itself into a curious gap between outright camp and genuine scares committing to neither. Hiddleston Chastain and Wasikowska are all amazing talents but theyre never allowed to cut loose and chew scenery nor are their characters relatable enough to make us root for them. Crimson Peak lurches to some semblance of life in its final half hour as sinister secrets are revealed more gruesome ghosts show up and one character suffers a brutal mortal wound which seemed to literally wake up the audience at the screening I attended. But it takes so damn long to get to this point that filmgoers may have given up caring. And while the computer-generated skeletal ghosts are very cool to look at 2013s del Toro-produced Mama also starring Chastain is a far scarier film. I love del Toro as a director and as a human being - the guy has his hands in all aspects of genre entertainment from films to TV to comic books to video games - and he knows how to build beautifully realized worlds. But for a place so full of blood its odd that Crimson Peak has no heart.

Photo Credit AP / Kerry Hayes advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An American girl marries a European gentleman with a shadowy past. Rated R (gore violence sexuality). BOTTOM LINE An extravagantly entertaining ghost story. Hiddleston could be our next Vincent Price. CAST Mia Wasikowska Tom Hiddleston Jessica Chastain LENGTH 159 The castle creaks the spirits shriek and blood is everywhere in ""Crimson Peak"" a gruesomely gorgeous ghost story from writer-director Guillermo del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth""). What it lacks in the element of surprise it more than makes up for with opulent visuals rich details and a pervasive atmosphere of dread. Part Emily Bronte part Edgar Allan Poe ""Crimson Peak"" seeps into your bones like the mist on an English moor. It begins as a romance in early 20th century Buffalo New York where well-born Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) eschews all suitors as she struggles to be taken seriously as a novelist. Only a handsome British newcomer Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) strikes the right note praising her talent as well as her beauty -- or perhaps hes just trying to convince her wealthy father Carter (an excellent Jim Beaver) to invest in a weird mining scheme. Either way Thomas marries young Edith and whisks her overseas to Allerdale Hall. advertisement | advertise on newsday All of this is so beautifully done -- from the elegant dialogue (co-written by Matthew Robbins) to the candlelight cinematography by Dan Laustsen -- that the movie would have been fairly satisfying if it ended here. Of course its just beginning. Allerdale proves to be a haunted mansion to end them all with pipes that cough red water and a ceiling so rotted that snow piles up on the floor. And whos that playing creepy music on the piano? Why its Thomas sister Lucille played by a shiveringly good Jessica Chastain. Del Toro lays all this on so thick that you can practically hear him cackling with glee. What makes it work -- in addition to the splendid sets and costumes -- is the stellar cast particularly Hiddleston. The only actor in the ""Thor"" films who didnt provoke snickering Hiddleston is marvelous as Sharpe an enervated aristocrat haunted by dark secrets. Its a role that could have gone to Vincent Price in a past era. (The films old-fashioned feel is slightly undercut by the CGI ghosts.) Youll find yourself consistently a step ahead of the plot but you may not care. ""Crimson Peak"" is thoroughly entertaining from start to ghastly finish. 230 MoviesCrimson Peak trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Monstrous romance Crimson Peak review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMonstrous romance Crimson Peak reviewOnly a director as skilled as Guillermo del Toro could prevent a haunted house flick as outlandish as Crimson Peak from turning into a gothic horror parody.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 15 2015Crimson PeakStarring Mia Wasikowska Tom Hiddleston Jessica Chastain Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver. Directed by Guillermo del Toro. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 119 minutes. 14AOnly a director as skilled as Guillermo del Toro could prevent a haunted house flick as outlandish as Crimson Peak from turning into a gothic horror parody.Ghosts dont just haunt the title manse they rock the joint. They crowd into this bug-infested heap in a windy corner of Blighty of 1901 sitting atop a pit of blood-red clay that oozes everywhere. It makes the Addams Family abode seem an Architectural Digest candidate in comparison.Article Continued BelowTheres never a doubt that aspiring American writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) is making a mistake to cross the Pond and cross the threshold even if she does fancy herself a teller of melodramatic fright tales. Her ghastly ghost mom told her so in a nightmare and isnt there a nice young doctor (Charlie Hunnam) right there in hometown Buffalo N.Y. who could make her happy?Mia Wasikowska is Edith Cushing the American who marries into a British aristocractic family with one heck of a creepy house in Crimson Peak.  (LEGENDARY PICTURES / UNIVERSAL PICTURES)  Ediths widowed dad Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) has his own misgivings. A shrewd businessman he feels theres something ""not quite right"" about bony British toff Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) and his frosty older sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) who have come seeking his funding for a newfangled clay-digging machine.Events transpire as they must to transport Edith to England having swooned to Sir Thoms suaveness. Shes less impressed by his handyman skills which dont include fixing a gaping roof a collapsing basement and spectral invaders plentiful enough to make this Grand Spook Central.But you dont go to a del Toro movie for the story (he co-wrote this one with Matthew Robins) or even the characters. You go for his all-encompassing imagery assisted by production designer Thomas Sanders costume designer Kate Hawley and cinematographer Dan Laustsen which conjures frightful worlds beyond human comprehension.In many respects Crimson Peak recalls The Devils Backbone an early work by the Mexican director set in a haunted orphanage in Spain during the Spanish Civil War. That film considerably more suspenseful than this one had an unexploded bomb in the courtyard waiting to go off.Crimson Peak has what you might call the Love That Dare Not Shriek Its Name equally explosive and no less obvious.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it In ""Crimson Peak"" Guillermo del Toro has Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain telegraph it in. (Kerry Hayes/Universal Pictures) By Michael OSullivan October 15 2015 Like the blood-red clay that lends the eponymous setting of ""Crimson Peak"" its name the movie is a visually striking but sticky thing. Set in 19th-century England in a decrepit but picturesque manor home and starring Mia Wasikowska Tom Hiddleston and Jessica Chastain the film by the stylish fantasist Guillermo del Toro looks marvelous but has a vein of narrative muck at its core. After a prologue set in Buffalo where the dashing English baronet Sir Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston) has wooed and wed a wealthy young American Edith (Wasikowska) the story quickly relocates -- along with Thomas Edith and Thomass creepy sister Lucille (Chastain) -- to the ancestral Cumberland home of the Sharpe family. Officially called Allerdale Hall the rotting family mansion boasts a gaping hole in the ceiling no heat water that runs red from the tap winds that howl through the halls with a hellish roar and an infestation of black moths. Oh yes it is also slowly sinking into the ooze that stains the snow-capped hills scarlet leading locals to bestow its nickname. In the age of the telegraph ""Crimson Peak"" broadcasts its sinisterness early and often. If you havent figured out whats going on well before Edith does its no fault of del Toros. And what is going on? Its no secret that Thomas is after Ediths money. The violent death of her father early in the film coupled with Thomass desperate need to finance his clay-harvesting operation removes any doubt about his ulterior motives. As for Lucille whats eating her is more mysterious but only slightly. Her dark secret should become apparent round about the time the film turns into a slasher flick. Youd be forgiven if you thought this was going to become a ghost story especially if youve seen the trailer. And to be sure wispy smoke-like apparitions do regularly rise through the floor and float through the halls terrorizing Edith. (As a child she was visited by the spirit of her dead mother warning her to ""beware Crimson Peak."" In her defense Edith doesnt discover the name until she gets there.) But who these spectres are and what they want remains unclear at least for a little while. Though del Toro is a master of macabre visuals his screenplay (written with his ""Mimic"" collaborator Matthew Robbins) is filled with cliches and frequently sets aside the supernatural story line -- along with any attendant suspense -- to focus on blunt tropes more familiar to fans of the violent-psychopath genre. In the aftermath of a family tragedy an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider. (Universal) On the plus side the prestige cast is a good one and mostly fun to watch even if Chastain could stand to dial down her Lady Macbeth-like performance say from 11 to a more reasonable 7 or 8. And the art direction (by Brandt Gordon) is impressive. But ""Crimson Peak"" feels less like a Gothic romance or supernatural mystery as its being touted by its marketers than a costume version of ""Scream"" dressed up in crinoline and top hats. Maybe somewhere in the creative process the plan was to make a period ghost story. Its not a bad idea in an age in which restraint and subtlety are routinely left out of scary movies. But the old-fashioned good intentions of ""Crimson Peak"" like the house at the center of the film quickly get swallowed up by puddles of bright red goo. R. At area theaters.

"Crimson Peak review Haunting but hollow - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Crimson Peak review Haunting but hollow Crimson Peak Legendary Pictures and Universal Mia Wasikowska stars as Edith Cushing in ""Crimson Peak"" directed by Guillermo del Toro. Mia Wasikowska stars as Edith Cushing in ""Crimson Peak"" directed by Guillermo del Toro. (Legendary Pictures and Universal) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Production design 14; story satisfaction 7. You may come out of the 1901-set Gothic chiller ""Crimson Peak"" humming the production design (by Thomas Sanders) or singing arias about the clothes (Kate Hawley costume designer) or composing symphonies of praise for the mellow honeyed menace of the cinematography (Dan Laustsen). If looks made the movie and they can in the right circumstances this movie would be made.""Crimson Peak"" represents not-quite-right circumstances. Its the latest from co-writer and director Guillermo del Toro. The fantasist is best known for ""Pans Labyrinth"" and he works very close to his subconscious when his cinematic and storytelling instincts are serving him well. But ""Crimson Peak"" is frustrating from nearly every angle. It lets the audience race ahead of the reveals while struggling to put all that tantalizingly rich atmosphere to effective narrative use. The title suggests a particularly gory mountain-climbing movie but thats another story. It begins in Buffalo N.Y. re-created here with lovely digital effects and good old-fashioned art direction featuring lots and lots of bowler hats and bustles. Aspiring short story writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) named cheekily after the Hammer horror stalwart Peter Cushing can see dead people her late mother especially whos given to sudden vapory appearances and cryptic warnings regarding a crimson peak of some sort.Edith has one respectable suitor a nice doctor (Charlie Hunnam who gave up the ""Fifty Shades"" franchise for this?) who smells a rat when his romantic rival hits town. The interloper Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston simultaneously hammy and restrained -- how do the Brits manage that so easily?) seeks backers for his clay-mining operation back home in England. The clay in question is crimson and the plainly haunted family estate Allerdale Hall creaks and groans atop a hill which is very nearly a ... peak. Aha Sharpes sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain having as little fun as is actorly possible) harbors a not-so-secret secret and looks like shell be killing any minute in every scene. The complicated motivations behind what del Toro intends as a perverse love story serve to clutter rather than energize the present-tense action.Once the action moves to England and Edith consents to marry her dashing untrustworthy Thomas the heroine becomes a standard-issue damsel in various sorts of distress. Not even the films occasional bursts of ultra-violence or the endlessly oozing red clay or Hiddleston crying a red tear or Chastain swanning around in one flaming crimson ball gown after another can infuse this gorgeous bore with anything like red-blooded suspense.

Its not just the movie that Guillermo del Toro the flawed doomed Mexican genius of horror and fantasy has wanted to make for years. Its all of them at once. While the Bronte sisters were dying of fever in their dismal swamp ""Crimson Peak"" might have been the uber-Gothic yarn that flickered through their overheated brains - if theyd also had sexual congress with Satan and consumed a bunch of shrooms. Its part Mary Shelley and part Arthur Conan Doyle (both authors are specifically mentioned) but its also ""Jane Eyre"" and H.P. Lovecraft and Hitchcocks ""Rebecca"" and Sam Raimis ""Evil Dead"" and a little 19th-century American realism by way of Edith Wharton or William Dean Howells.Indeed the films title refers to a crumbling ancestral manse more dreadful than the Thornfield Hall of ""Jane Eyre"" and perhaps even more toxic than Haworth Parsonage where the Bronte daughters nurtured their literary genius and then died. (One gruesome hypothesis is that Haworths water supply was contaminated by the rotting human remains in the adjacent cemetery.) When the handsome but mysterious Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) the consummate English gentleman with a secret brings his virginal literary-minded American bride Edith (Mia Wasikowska) home to his estate in the remote hills of Cumbria the only big surprise is that she doesnt flee immediately. Edith has read a lot of books back in Buffalo but apparently not the right ones.Sharpes garish and rambling manor house resembles the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland more than an actual English domicile of any vintage. It has an enormous hole in the roof so rain and snow and birds and insects enter at will and huge cracks in the floor where the house is subsiding into the oozy red clay of the underlying hillside. Thats right Bats upstairs blood-colored goo coming through the foundation and an old-fashioned cage elevator you can ride all the way down to the sub-basement. Clank clank clank; glub glub glub. Theres no need for ghosties and goblins to come in through either aperture because theyre already here. Edith encounters several among them a hideous corpse figure in the upstairs bathtub whos an obvious nod to ""The Shining"" (one of perhaps three dozen literary or film references one could pick out).But the most frightening specter in Sir Thomas household is clearly his not-quite-undead sister Lucille played by Jessica Chastain in a series of forbidding gowns and wigs that split the difference between spinsterly severity and ""hot damn."" I suppose the problem with Lucille is the same as the problem with ""Crimson Peak"" overall which is that shes a magnificent creation but were never quite sure whether to view her as campy and hilarious or genuinely terrifying. Many of the influences that del Toro and co-writer Matthew Robbins have channeled into this passion project - which has been gestating ever since the release of ""Pans Labyrinth"" in 2006 - partake of both elements to be sure The Hammer horror films of the 60s (geek alert Ediths last name is Cushing) or Lovecrafts ludicrous tales of gelatinous entities from beyond time.Dont get me wrong I will happily watch Chastain in anything and this movie is almost everything. So we see her here feeding butterflies to ants and seducing American provincials at the piano and bringing obviously poisonous tea to her new sister-in-law and prowling the corridors of her lugubrious home with a silky serpentine demeanor that sets the rats to flight. It pains me to report that when we finally find out what Lucille is up to it is A) not a surprise at all and B) not a sufficient explanation for all her ritualistic quasi-vampirical behavior which really calls for worship of the Old Gods or fulfillment of some pre-Christian family ritual or cannibalism on a commercial scale. You Might Also Like If Hiddlestons Sir Thomas is something of a ditherer and dreamer who cant quite decide whether his loyalties lie with his blushing bride or his sinister sister he belongs to the long tradition of Gothic semi-heroes who are weaker than the women around them. (Ive only seen Hiddleston play upper-crust Englishmen Shakespearean monarchs or the duplicitous Norse god Loki in the Marvel universe so Im eager to find out what he can do as Hank Williams in the upcoming ""I Saw the Light."") In ""Crimson Peak"" Hiddlestons best work comes before we even get to the Gothic manse of shrieking corpses and bubbling crimson glop during the extended prefatory tale weve already had an entirely different story about Gilded Age social mores and venture capitalism set in turn-of-the-century Buffalo.Thats where Sir Thomas shows up supposedly to find Yankee funding for a steam-powered engine that will extract the gore-tastic gunk from beneath Crimson Peak and render it into bricks for the American building boom. But does he really want to join the Industrial Age or do he and Lucille have eyes only for the bookish wide-eyed girl who stands to inherit a fortune if something should befall her self-made millionaire father (played by veteran TV actor Jim Beaver)? Dad smells a rat right away and so does the lunk-like young doctor played by Charlie Hunnam whos too smitten by Edith to make a move. But all this drawing-room intrigue points back to the fact that ""Crimson Peak"" is effectively an imitation of 25 different kinds of things in this case a certain variety of 1930s or 40s film that requires a long genial windup in ""normal"" surroundings before it gets to the actual plot. If youre not the exact kind of culture-vulture weirdo for whom del Toro has made this movie - a demographic that definitely includes me and is not necessarily tiny - Im not sure that ""Crimson Peak"" will make any damn sense at all. As the director has himself observed its a female-centric film in a genre typically aimed at teenage boys and young men. Its heavy on visuals to the level of morning-after-Halloween candy hangover but it also calls upon innumerable cultural references that are not massively popular. Its mannered and stylized and layered to deliberate but almost suffocating excess - if production designer Thomas E. Sanders and costume designer Kate Hawley dont get Oscar nods then there truly is no God of movies.Its unduly harsh no doubt to suggest that the master visual fantasist of our age has pursued his dream project or at least one of them into yet another creative and commercial dead end. (Del Toro got fired from the ""Hobbit"" trilogy or fired himself. He has been unable to fund his proposed adaptations of ""Frankenstein"" or Lovecrafts ""At the Mountains of Madness."" Even though ""Pacific Rim"" his expensive attempt to reanimate the kaiju genre ultimately turned a profit Hollywood scuttlebutt suggests that the planned sequels probably wont happen.) ""Crimson Peak"" will find a loyal following - maybe not in movie theaters in the fall of 2015 but eventually. Still I cant help feeling that Guillermo del Toros career is like Sir Thomas haunted mansion a magnificent and impossible concoction from another time open to the sky and with a basement full of evil gunk.

EntertainmentMovies Butterflies and blood in the delightful screamer Crimson Peak Originally published October 15 2015 at 1205 am Updated October 15 2015 at 1026 am Movie review of ""Crimson Peak"" Guillermo del Toros latest fantasia is a crimson-stained voyage into a house where the walls bleed dresses seem to sprout fungus and butterflies flit throughout the film. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Early on in Guillermo del Toros ""Crimson Peak"" the ghosts seem to be made of equal parts smoke and black lace. Its a beautiful old-school screech of a movie both delicate and wildly over-the-top -- as if a classic Gothic horror film exploded leaving blood on the floor. Recalling both del Toros ""Pans Labyrinth"" and 1940s Old Hollywood (particularly ""Rebecca"" and ""Jane Eyre"") ""Crimson Peak"" begins in upstate New York at the turn of the last century with young Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) at its center -- a virginal writer whose wide quiet eyes seem to be seeking love. In swans the titled handsome Brit Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) whose vampire-pale sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) hovers nearby like a looming shadow. Edith who clearly cant hear the movies ominous score is soon on her way to the Sharpes family pile Allerdale Hall -- and soon discovers more than a few Mysterious Documents Menacing Weather Patterns Things That Go Bump in The Night (and Day) and Dark Secrets. Those capital letters seem appropriate as everything here is heightened -- the performances (particularly Chastain whose eyebrows are perpetually headed to the rooftops) the music the glorious sets and costumes. Del Toro isnt dealing in reality here -- those seeking subtlety should look elsewhere though youll find a bit in the chemistry between Wasikowska and Hiddleston -- but in a world underlined in red and punctuated with fountain-penned exclamation points. I suspect theres no geological explanation for why the clay-heavy dirt surrounding Allerdale Hall causes the snow to be stained blood-crimson (if there is do tell me so I can avoid that region) or why the house seems to be bleeding from within -- but it serves the story splendidly. Movie Review 1/2   Crimson Peak with Mia Wasikowska Tom Hiddleston Jessica Chastain Charlie Hunnam Jim Beaver. Directed by Guillermo del Toro from a screenplay by del Toro and Matthew Robbins. 119 minutes. Rated R for bloody violence some sexual content and brief strong language. Several theaters. ""Crimson Peak"" is more creepy than scary (despite a couple of gruesomely violent deaths) but del Toros imagination blooms in every frame. Note the butterfly theme flittering through the movie (even the resident little dog is a papillon); the way that Lucilles blue-velvet dress seems to have sprouted fungus; the birdcage-like elevator; the bone-scraping sound of a spoon stirring tea in a wispy china cup; the withered leaves floating into a house that seems to have death in its walls.

But for most of its running time ""Crimson Peak"" lets us get lost happily in a filmmakers beautiful darkness. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Directed by Guillermo del Toro the Mexican maestro of moody mayhem the film runs on atmosphere and suggestion rather than terror. Which is a not-insignificant problem for a ghost story. Mia Wasikowska who seems to have a monopoly lately on Victorian-era heroines stars as a porcelain-skinned young woman named Edith Cushing (a nod to Hammer horror legend Peter Cushing and just one of del Toros many references to his influences). Set at the dawn of the 20th century (1901 Buffalo to be exact) the movie opens as Edith is struggling to be taken seriously as a writer. She wants to be Mary Shelley. Living with her self-made engineer father in an old dark house thats haunted by her dead mother Edith receives spectral nightly visits from a wraith warning her to ""Beware of Crimson Peak."" More serious and bookish than interested in the fripperies and frivolities of high society Edith is torn between two suitors - Charlie Hunnams Dr. Alan McMichael and a dashingly mysterious new arrival from England Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston). The doc who Edith has known since childhood is solid dependable and earnest. He doesnt stand a chance next to Hiddlestons seductive rake even though he tends to dress like a natty undertaker and is constantly accompanied by his clingy sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain dialing the fiendish knob to 11). After her disapproving father is brutally murdered Edith wastes no time falling into Hiddlestons consoling arms and he whisks her off to his familys desolate run-down estate across the Atlantic. The house with its moaning drafts creaking doors haunted history and dilapidated roof is the best character in the movie. Built on top (on the peak of you might say) subterranean deposits of red clay (a shade not unlike crimson) the mansion is slowly sinking into the earth as if Satan himself was trying to repossess it. There Ediths apparitions from beyond return with a new urgency and there are other undisclosed forces of evil at work too. Del Toro and cinematographer Dan Laustsen (who worked together on 1997s Mimic) are clearly having a blast painting every corner of their creepy crimson canvas. But as sumptuous as Crimson Peak looks and as sinister as Hiddleston and Chastain are you never get transported to the bone-chilling places that a great ghost story should take you. What its missing is the suggestively Freudian menace of Vincent Price or a Christopher Lee. Which begs the question why would you settle for a less-than-frightening facsimile when you could always go back and watch the better versions from the 60s?

Courtesy of Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Mia Wasikowska is proof of reincarnation. The Australian actress must be possessed by the spirit of Lillian Gish. At 22 -- the same age at which Gish starred in Birth of a Nation -- Wasikowska became a bankable name playing the lead in Tim Burtons garish Alice in Wonderland. In the four years since shes used her clout to squeeze into corsets. Cannily Wasikowska has capitalized on her strengths her intelligent stare her introverted smile and her raw handsomeness which looks as freshly scrubbed as a shucked pearl. Even when pressed to play a modern woman Wasikowska insists on a twist In Only Lovers Left Alive she was a rock amp; roll immortal; in David Cronenbergs Maps to the Stars she hid her arms in long black gloves like a grungy grande dame. Like the best vintage heroines she radiates both pluck and frailty. Her characters can almost certainly save themselves but they make us want to jump heroically into the screen just in case.Naturally Wasikowska is perfectly cast in Guillermo del Toros gothic romance Crimson Peak as short-story writer Edith Cushing who sacrifices her happy spinsterhood to marry a mysterious British baron (Tom Hiddleston) who comes with a haunted mansion and an all-too-real wicked sister (Jessica Chastain). Edith starts the film as a practical woman who just wants to live with her doting father (Jim Beaver) and publish ghost stories. When her first tale is rejected by a condescending prat who merely compliments her handwriting she squares her shoulders and submits it again -- this time typed.Film DetailsCritics Pick Crimson Peak RatingR GenreHorror Running Time119 min. More Info Trailer But after Hiddlestons charming Sir Tom whisks her from Buffalo to England Wasikowska allows her sturdy girl to simper. Shes so deadpan-perfect for the part her casting could almost be part of the joke along with Ediths wilting pansy-covered coats avalanche of blond curls and velvet dresses with mutton sleeves that grow bigger with every scene.Ediths costumes get puffier and ever more fragile -- her tragic heroine is so overinflated she could pop. So too could the film which is so bombastic so emotional so beautiful that one misstep could burst del Toros ambitions so that the whole thing collapses into a sputtering lampoon. It might have if del Toro had stuck with his original actress Emma Stone a charmer who probably couldnt resist playing Edith with a wink -- shes too clever to play innocent. But Wasikowska and del Toro are in sync. Theyre committed to telling this high-toned spook story straight even though it might take audiences a couple of reels to get their groove. And like Edith waltzing with her husband-to-be once we take Crimson Peaks hand were likely hooked. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm This is an unnatural film twice over. First its astonishing del Toros 57 million Hammer Horror was funded -- though compared with his three-times-costlier Pacific Rim this time keeping the director happy is comparatively cheap. Secondly each frame is deliriously artificial. Del Toro indulges in dramatic thunderclaps and over-the-moon production design. The crumbling mansion where Sir Tom transplants his bride is a gorgeous nightmare Dead flies cover the tables the red clay soil bleeds into the house ghouls writhe in the halls and the roof has a hole so big it must have been punched through by God. Leaves rain through that opening though there are no trees around. In the winter the ceiling snows. And if youre wondering why Sir Tom doesnt just hire a repairman watch a more realistic movie. Asked how many rooms this family seat has he shrugs ""I dont know?""As Ediths sister-in-law Lady Lucille Chastain is a fabulous monster. The first time we see her shes disrupting a cocktail party in a red silk dress with a spiny back and scales. Later she feeds a butterfly to ants -- del Toro zooms in on the nest devouring its eye -- and later still manages to scare us while squeezing a fistful of scrambled eggs. By the time Chastain scrapes a spoon against a bowl of porridge with the scrrrrawwwwp of nails on a chalkboard she has us in nervous fearful giggles. Its the first fun role Chastain has had in years. Keep them coming.Like Quentin Tarantinos Death Proof Crimson Peak is del Toros faithful homage to a foolish genre. The risk is that audiences who dont share that love wont appreciate the work like the worlds best cover band nailing obscure nu-metal hits. Eyes may roll at Crimson Peaks quirks the loud gasp when Sir Tom asks Edith to dance the repeated use of an old-timey iris wipe the unabashed symphonic score.As the baron says of Ediths book ""Its absurdly sentimental."" So what? All great melodramas must be. The melo- in ""melodrama"" is from the Greek for ""song."" Though this movie waltzes to its own strange rhythm del Toro hits every note.CRIMSON PEAK | Directed by Guillermo del Toro | Written by del Toro and Matthew Robbins | Universal Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

"Review A bloody disappointing Crimson Peak from Guillermo del Toro - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview A bloody disappointing Crimson Peak from Guillermo del ToroBy Karen DSouzakdsouzamercurynews.comPosted 10/14/2015 113557 AM PDTUpdated 10/16/2015 022428 PM PDT Hiding a knife in her billowing Victorian petticoat a damsel in distress endlessly battles the undead in the bloody disappointing ""Crimson Peak.""Alas Guillermo del Toros opulently designed Gothic horror movie tries so hard to turn the genres gender rules on their head that it collapses under the gloomy weight of its highbrow intentions.Wide-eyed ingenue Edith Cushing whose name harkens back to the Hammer Films canon may look like a dainty porcelain doll bedecked in pearls and lace but shes actually a badass in a bustle. Unfortunately the director abandons all sense of subtlety in favor of eerie eye candy ultimately letting the movie unravel into strange ""Flowers in the Attic"" style camp. Mia Wasikowska as Edith Cushing in Crimson Peak. (Legendary Pictures) ( Legendary Pictures ) Mia Wasikowska (""Jane Eyre"") has her moments as the feisty Edith who overcomes Victorian notions of propriety first to write a novel and then to fight for her life. But this ""Wuthering Heights"" is spiked with so many gruesome decomposing corpses and gratuitous jump-scares that the film soon squanders its atmospheric riches.In its best moments its a visually sumptuous fantasy reminiscent of the directors jewel ""Pans Labyrinth."" The opening scenes are macabre indeed with American heiress Edith confronting the creeping wraithlike ghost of her dead mother with its grasping tendrils of doom. Edith is an author who writes about the supernatural because she has actually seen creatures which should make her something other than a standard issue heroine-waif.Advertisement Unfortunately Edith all too quickly succumbs to stereotype. She falls for the sinister charms of Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston from ""Thor"") a baronet of the bizarre and follows him to the dark thrall of Crimson Peak a grim manor shrouded in mist and despair. She gets her mojo back only to engage in a frightfully predictable game of cat and mouse with Sharpes twisted sister Lady Lucille (a steely Jessica Chastain) even as the house seems to drown in a pool of its own blood. You are pulling for Edith for about half the film but once she enters the charnel house of Allendale Hall the film descends into a mishmash homage of classic horror tropes excessive CGI ghouls and downright cheesy lines of dialogue that utterly undercut the tone of an elegant chiller. The gorgeously rotting mansion with its moaning green walls cobweb-ridden hallways and gaping holes in the roof may be the most believable character in the movie. Even the dog seems wasted as the bone-shattering violence piles up and the ghosts multiply but the dread disappears because the characters are as shallow as the teacups full of the creepy ""tea"" Lucille keeps pushing on Edith. Perhaps a little less money thrown at the sumptuous production values and more time spent on the workings of psychology would have given ""Crimson"" some of the intensity of the low-budget but far superior ""It Follows"" whose existential menace lasts for days. Certainly Hiddleston usually has more presence than this and his scenes with Wasikowska lack the sexual chemistry to give the love story any zing. Chastain tries to imbue the monstress Lucille with intelligence but in the end shes saddled with too many cliches to be truly unsettling. From the opening shot the audience feels miles ahead of the characters and smugness soon turns into impatience.Del Toros gift has always been his mastery of the unexpected the surprising political resonance of ""Pans Labyrinth"" the wry wit of ""Hellboy."" Here however he forgets that less is more when it comes to fear. This haunted house flick has all the discipline and restraint of a Spirit Halloween store. Once the suspense is gone all thats left is the blood spatter.From the first bludgeoning to the last dagger ""Crimson Peak"" is so awash in buckets tubs and vats of blood that it becomes a bit of a bore. The final tableau with its long lingering shots of yet another ghost with a message reminds you of an amusement-park ride you cant wait to get off. Contact Karen DSouza at 408-271-3772.

So it went with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguezs ""Grindhouse"" omnibus which fueled so many conversations about the gritty exploitation movies that obscured the actual project. Now comes Guillermo del Toros exceptionally fun ""Crimson Peak"" a vibrant refashioning of gothic romance and blood-soaked horror that injects fresh energy into old-fashioned tropes -- even if del Toro insists otherwise. In an introductory statement circulated to the press before screenings of ""Crimson Peak"" del Toro deems his first feature in two years ""my attempt to harken back to a classic old-fashioned grand Hollywood production in the gothic romance genre"" citing productions such as the forties-era adaptations of ""Great Expectations"" and ""Jane Eyre."" Del Toro however operates more in tune with B-movie producer Val Lewton who used ""Jane Eyre"" to develop a darkly ambiguous take on the relationship between emotional duress and supernatural events in ""I Walked With a Zombie"" a title forced on him by studio executives ahead of the 1943 production. Lewton ostensibly smuggled a sophisticated riff on literary conceits and psychological processes into a discardable assignment. Del Toro operates along similar lines ""Crimson Peak"" may borrow from familiar traditions but it fuses them in an original way. Theres a distinct self-awareness percolating throughout ""Crimson Peak"" starting early on when Victorian-era aspiring writer Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) expresses her desire to become the next Mary Shelley. Developing a short story inspired by the loss of her mother in her childhood she asserts ""the ghost is a metaphor for the past."" And so it is throughout ""Crimson Peak"" as Edith -- whose very last name nods to Hammer Horror regular Peter Cushing -- develops an alternately eerie and entertaining portrait of personal baggage manifested in literal terms. Beyond saluting the stories and storytellers who inspire him del Toro tosses around their ingredients and inspects their appeal. In the process he constructs his own Frankensteins monster of stitched-together pastiche to reintroduce a certain inspired elegance to the studio-mandated storytelling and while it doesnt always hold together ""Crimson Peak"" offers a welcome mashup alternative to conventional scares. Ultimately ""Crimson Peak"" turns into a gothic riff on ""The Honeymoon Killers"" with Edith being seduced by the charming Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who takes her under wing after shes abruptly orphaned. Brought to a remote mansion in snowy northern England Edith finds herself holed up with Thomas and his steely-eyed sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain in a delightfully nefarious turn) along with any number of ghastly bloodied specters that crop up in the hallways to freak her out. Naturally these visions of the dead point to a dreadful history involving the Sharpes that Edith must slowly uncover by herself. With a series of simplistic jumpscares and a few too many ghostly effects tweeted by CGI ""Crimson Peak"" occasionally undercuts the stronger horrific elements that stem from everything we dont see. But it hits on a satisfactory balance of shock and intrigue with abrupt flashes of violence that intensify the ominous tone. Plenty of contemporary filmmakers turn to gore as a prop to excite and repulse viewers in equal measure; del Toro injects it with an eye for revitalizing certain classical tropes. The flow of blood in one key sequence erupts into an otherwise clean white palette that syncs up nicely with the painterly contrasts found throughout ""Crimson Peak."" Aided by cinematographer Dan Lausten with whom del Toro last collaborated to construct the subterranean horrors of ""Mimic"" the filmmaker develops a prolonged finale at the decrepit mansion with a blend of minimalism and grand visionary conceits. The ramshackle building where snow falls through the rafters and a metallic elevator creaks through each floor sets the stage for a narrative based solely around the mounting tensions between three people. Though some of the dialogue in ""Crimson Peak"" sounds false or stilted -- just wait until the moment where Thomas tries to get Edith excited about a trip to the post office -- the bald-faced artifice is part of the movies appeal. Theres a continual sense of deconstruction to each step of this fairly predictable plot right down to the payoff of the crimson-soaked finale. Above all with Chastains icy stare pitted against Wasikowskas developing confidence del Toro has made a feminist inversion of the usual gothic formula in which male desires wind up animating the behavior of the female characters. In another noticeable challenge to Hollywood conventions ""Crimson Peak"" lets the ladies run the show and their final showdown doesnt disappoint. Its hard to glean these appealing variables by simply considering the genre that inspired ""Crimson Peak"" (or for that matter from the confounding neon posters). Instead one must look to del Toros own filmography which has consistently transformed recognizable components into uniquely enjoyable visions. From the Goya-inspired nightmares of ""Pans Labyrinth"" to the Kaiju monsters of ""Pacific Rim"" del Toro never fails to shake up expectations. Beyond its surface pleasures ""Crimson Peak"" also confronts the demons of modern entertainment. The movie frightens and surprises us in familiar ways but at the same time issues a plea for restraint. Grade B+ ""Crimson Peak"" opens nationwide on Friday.

Thanks Reply PHIL May 12 2016 538 pm Couldnt agree more. In fact I worry that Crimson may suffer the same fate as Grindhouse in terms of box office (maybe not as bad). Both are great films but are very different from what the U.S. box office usually offers up. Fingers crossed. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Crimson Peak Running time 119 minutes. Rated R (violence sex disturbing images). Never let it be said that Guillermo del Toros ""Crimson Peak"" is not a lush Gothic ghost story. On the contrary it just about Gothics itself to death. Like one of del Toros Victorian apparitions the plot is a wisp tricked out in fabulous threads -- and the pallid trio of Mia Wasikowska Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston an afterthought to the sumptuous costumes sound design and sets. Heroine Edith Cushing (Wasikowska) is an aspiring American author with an eye for the supernatural. When compared to spinster Jane Austen she coolly replies shed rather be ""Frankenstein"" author Mary Shelley ""who died a widow."" Her close friend modern-minded Dr. Alan McMichael is played by Charlie Hunnam (""Sons of Anarchy"") who appears so infrequently you have to doubt his story about the role requiring him to bail on ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" Tom HiddlestonPhoto Universal Pictures Blind to the doctors affections Edith falls for charming if slightly frayed British baronet Thomas Sharpe (Hiddleston) just as her widowed father (Jim Beaver) is mysteriously murdered. With nothing keeping her in Buffalo NY she accompanies her groom to his English countryside mansion Allerdale Hall with his sister Lucille (Chastain) in tow. That there is something strange between the morose Sharpe siblings is immediately obvious and almost comically reinforced as Lucille glowers at Edith in nearly every shot. Their tragic crumbling manor -- nicknamed Crimson Peak for the scarlet clay it sits on -- is the real star here all faded splendor creaking corridors and clanking pipes. Outside Thomas steampunk clay-extraction invention churns away like a beating heart (hi Edgar Allan Poe). The setting is spectacular but its ghosts underwhelm. Kudos to del Toro for bucking the minimalist trend in spooky movies but his Grand Guignol spirits are so visible they begin to resemble fun-house monsters. Anyway the real menace here is not the supernatural kind -- its Lucilles ""Flowers in the Attic"" vibe. Chastain and Wasikowska take center stage while Hiddleston flutters around like one of Allerdales huge black moths. Watching the women square off within del Toros eye-popping painterly palette is a feast for the eyes if not particularly substantial fare for the mind.

So its a surprise - and a shame - to report that his new film Crimson Peak while often entertaining feels like a mish-mash of overfamiliar elements falling way short in the wild weird what-the-fuck-was-that department. Mia Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing (yes we see what you did there Guillermo) an independent young writer in turn-of-the-century New England who allows herself to be wooed and won by Tom Hiddlestons dashing but down-at-heel English aristocrat Thomas Sharpe. Returning with him to his crumbling Lakeland mansion Edith must face not only Sharpes grasping possibly incestuous sister (Jessica Chastain) but also a lurking supernatural presence. The elements are in place for an old-school gothic shocker in the finest Hammer tradition - but Crimson Peak feels more like something Tim Burton might cook up and not in a good way. Del Toro wraps his intricate sets in a super-saturated CGI sheen what shouldve been grimy and solid feels slippery and not-quite-there. It doesnt help that the Canadian locations feel absolutely nothing like Cumbria - the local post office looks like a Wild West staging post. All three actors work hard - Hiddleston and Chastains sibling relationship is deliciously grotesque - and when the melodrama hits fever pitch Crimson Peak lurches into life. But overall this lacks weight and intensity a Bronte-esque bauble smeared in twenty-first-century slickness.

It is quite similar to The Devils Backbone in many aspects of the plot which leads to a fair amount of it being rather predictable.While the plot may be a little on the disappointing side the visuals are stunning. There is fantastic use of strong colours to influence the mood of the scene as del Toro has done before with films like Pans Labyrinth making colour an integral part of how it all comes across and making it well worth seeing on a big screen as opposed to a smaller one.Over all it is not up to the standard of some of his other films which I think have caused many people to have very high expectations for it but it is a good film when judged by itself.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 8 2015Julie RTastemakerFeaturedFrom reading the synopsis of this film I didnt really fancy going to this film but my husband wanted to see it.

The problem with the film is that the name of Guillermo Del Tora promises so much and in this case doesnt deliver. The main problems are the film is too long winded and rather lacking in any surprises or originality. Not terrible - but very disappointing.

Run ((UNIVERSAL)) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 13 2015 at 1000 PM updated October 14 2015 at 1022 AM comments When I was 12 years old I would watch triple-features of Gothic melodramas like ""Jane Eyre"" ""Dragonwyck"" and ""Rebecca"" -- and then run outside with my Super 8 camera and a pint of Karo-syrup-and-red-dye blood and make horror movies in the snow. Guillermo del Toros ""Crimson Peak"" is what they would have looked like if Id had about 50 million dollars real actors and a lot more talent. I loved it and if youre still in touch with your inner-12-year-old - and that kid was a horror fan - you will too. A rich proudly retro shocker it capably moves down the genre checklist. Orphan with an inheritance? Got it. Darkly evil sister-in-law serving sinister cups of tea? Mmm-hmm. Crumbling old mansion where ghostly things go bump in the night? No problem. A little Poe a bit of Bronte and a smattering of Sheridan Le Fanu -- Del Toro has it covered. The movie takes a bit of easing into - the period is a little shaky (it seems to be about 1900) and the characters arent always clearly introduced. But soon it takes hold as Sir Thomas Sharpe - played by Tom Hiddleston with just the slightest epicene menace - comes to America looking for a business loan. And leaves it with wealthy heiress Mia Wasikowska. Thats good news for him as Hiddleston lives in a dark wet corner of England that makes Lears blasted heath look like Miami Beach. The family mansion is falling apart and the family business seems to be built on - well mining red mud. Not surprisingly theres not a huge call for that and so the house and the Sharpe fortunes are both sinking quickly - literally in the case of the house a deliciously decaying manse that would send even Roderick Usher to the nearest Motel 6. How convenient that Sir Roderick now has a rich new American bride. How sad that it seems very unlikely shell celebrate their first anniversary. The cast is first rate. Hiddleston manages to be Byronic without being ironic and Jessica Chastain is marvelously evil as his sister. Mia Wasikowska - whose wide eyes and flowing blonde hair sometimes recalls young Mia Farrow - is perfection as the innocent Yank in peril. Charlie Hunnam playing the man who truly cares for her is less interesting but then in Roger Corman terms this is the Mark Damon part - dull but necessary. And del Toro knows his Corman - and his Hammer and his Daphne du Maurier and every other familiar favorite he draws from here. Its no mistake that in one shot Sharpe seems to have taken fashion tips from Vincent Price in ""The Tomb of Ligeia""; no mere coincidence that the heiresss family name is Cushing. And del Toro who has often seemed hampered in America cuts loose in ways he never has outside of his Spanish-language films. He fills the screen with small marvelous touches (a charming iris-out that ends some scenes like an old silent) and huge breathtaking ones (the Sharpe mansion as a multi-leveled marvel of crumbling banisters rich wallpapers and crimson mud seeping through the floorboards like blood.) Of course sometimes his style loses all grasp on reality. Who builds their house on top of a working mine? Or leaves a hole in the roof so huge that the first floor fills with dead leaves and snow? At its worst and best ""Crimson Peak"" exists in a weird parallel world where very separate rules of logic apply. Its a true waking nightmare. Or the kind of dream another 12-year-old horror fan may have had once in Mexico - and nearly 40 years later finally gets to make real.

Daily Edition Login to download Crimson Peak Film Review 700 PM PDT 10/13/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The second-best horror film of 1946. TWITTER Jessica Chastain stars in Guillermo del Toros lavish Gothic horror romance playing an Englishwoman who torments her brothers new bride. Guillermo del Toro tries his elegant best to shake the cobwebs from a musty old genre but still ends up telling a very traditional and predictable haunted house yarn in Crimson Peak. The gifted fantasy/sci-fi/horror specialist has made a film thats very bloody and bloody stylish at that one thats certainly unequaled in its field for the beauty of its camerawork sets costumes and effects. But its also conventionally plotted and not surprising or scary at all as it resurrects hoary horror tropes from decades ago to utilize them in conventional rather than fresh or subversive ways. Its a thousand times more elaborate and sumptuous than the most recent demented domicile tale of note The Babadook but not an ounce as frightening or disturbing. Still on the basis of anticipated scares and del Toros following Universal should get some potent pre-Halloween business out of this beautifully bedecked Gothic-style melodrama. If the devil were indeed entirely in the details del Toro would have a genre classic on his hands. This is clearly a filmmaker who relishes research and enriching his work with deep-dish references; the storys first half set in Buffalo New York in 1901 practically groans with the sense of a society about to assert itself broadly on the world stage of the expansiveness of the incipient Teddy Roosevelt era rooted in bold initiative and industriousness. At the same time the screenplay by the director and veteran scribe Matthew Robbins is deeply informed by the tradition of both literary and cinematic Gothic melodrama which in context is used to convey the inbred diseased and inevitably doomed society of royalty and Old World privilege here represented by a crumbling manse in rural England the location of the dramas second half. Read more Jessica Chastain is a Gothic Punk Princess for W Mag But no matter how richly and skillfully this physically seductive venture transports the viewer into its spheres of interest one is still left with a film dedicated to a sincere and utterly unironic use of such chestnuts as an evil sister-in-law poisoning her unsuspecting victim via the tea she continually serves her a spooky house conveniently being situated miles from the nearest neighbor strict instructions never to descend beneath the houses main floor and a frightened heroine (played by an actress who four years ago was the lead in a fine Jane Eyre) continually sweeping through dark rooms carrying a candelabra. All this in a film featuring a leading lady whose first and last words of voiceover are the same ""Ghosts are real. This much I know."" The one hour of set-up is firmly situated in the real world and is all the better for it. The damsel soon to be distressed is young Edith Cushing (Mia Wasikowska) herself an aspiring writer of Gothic melodrama who fancies herself the new Mary Shelley and lives in one of turn-of-the-century Buffalos most distinguished homes as the only child of widowed industrialist Carter Cushing (Jim Beaver) who worked his way up the hard way. Although beautiful and highly eligible Edith remains by temperament more the bookish recluse and still resists the perennial ardent attentions of childhood friend-turned-handsome young doctor Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam). Weakening her defenses however is newly arrived Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) an Englishman who has come accompanied by his less congenial older sister Lady Lucille Sharpe (Jessica Chastain) seeking American backing for a ""clay harvester"" a mining machine that will efficiently do the work it takes many men to accomplish. Seeing right through the effete Thomas obsequiousness shrewd old Cushing (theres no doubt where del Toro took that name from) takes to calling the fancy man Little Lord Fauntleroy and noting Lucilles more pronounced oddness announces that ""Theres something not quite right about them."" Hes absolutely right and yet doesnt know the half of it. Read more A To-Do List for Film Buffs in Los Angeles Right Now When a detective delivers Cushing plenty of dirt on the English couple the old man pays the ultimate price for his skepticism in a horribly violent murder scene thats made to look like an accident. Her fathers death and the money leaves Edith free to follow her heart if not her mind to England as Thomas virgin bride. Unfortunately Lady Lucille is part of the package -- an increasingly big part in fact that could be more objectively described as self-anointed jailer and nurse. This sort of malevolent gatekeeper-of-the-family-secrets character has populated many a fusty melodrama over the decades and the sexual jealousy and hostility Lady Lucille feels for Edith is nothing new either. Now a prisoner in a cold dilapidated mansion Edith must endure encounters with a crawling grasping black ghost as she sneaks about the house (often with candelabra in hand) discovering secrets and trying to gain any advantage she can over the desperate Lucille who feels her brothers affection slipping away from her. The fine actors on hand all play it straight with absolute conviction in what theyre doing but the one who best captures the spirit of the times -- and plays the one character who sees through the visitors ruse -- is Beaver a veteran character actor still not widely enough seen on the big screen. Its entirely likely that no previous rendition of this sort of sexually twisted psychologically degenerative and spectrally haunted fright story has ever been served up with so much stylistic sauce as del Toro has poured onto Crimson Peak so named for the the red clay that the Sharpes family pile Allerdale Hall is built upon and which colorfully and symbolically contaminates all it touches. The immersive attention to detail in regard to the fanciful props glorious fabrics layers of clothing color coordination home furnishings bathroom ceramics detailed hand craftsmanship paintings on the walls the latest inventions and manifestations of turn-of-the-century upper-class life feel compulsive but not fetishistic; to be sure del Toro insisted upon and coordinated all of this but special mention must be made of the exceptional contributions of production designer Tom Sanders costume designer Kate Hawley cinematographer Dan Laustsen and their staffs. For anyone interested in all-in full-freight period re-creation the film is worth seeing for this alone. Dramatically and even morally however Crimson Peak feels like a 1946 film made seven decades later; the conventions are all carried over intact from an earlier time so that only the technical aspects and gore level identify it as a product of its own era. This is not necessarily a bad thing at all except that the conventions the film trades in seem so dusty and time-worn that they cry out for revision and/or reconsideration. Del Toro plays it all very straight so that the only surprise is the lack of same.

Even the pristine white snow bleeds bright scarlet in ""Crimson Peak"" the malformed love child between a richly atmospheric gothic romance and an overripe Italian giallo -- delivered into this world by the mad doctor himself horror maestro Guillermo del Toro operating at his most stylistically unhinged. Aflame with color and awash in symbolism this undeniably ravishing yet ultimately disappointing haunted-house meller is all surface and no substance sinking under the weight of its own self-importance into the sanguine muck below. Named after the estate to which Mia Wasikowskas newly orphaned and even newlier-wed heroine unwisely relocates with a plainly duplicitous brother-sister pair ""Crimson Peak"" proves too frou-frou for genre fans too gory for the Harlequin crowd and all-around too obvious for anyone pressed to guess what the siblings dark secret could possibly be and will likely wind up an in-the-red setback to Universals most profitable year. Its a testament to del Toros stature in Hollywood that the studio greenlit this costly R-rated indulgence far closer in tone to such Spanish-language chillers as ""The Devils Backbone"" and ""Cronos"" than any of the comicbook and action spectaculars that have since made him a household name in the States. After butting heads with Warners over ""Pacific Rims"" PG-13 rating (which may explain the delays to that pics sequel) he dramatically switches gears on a twisted costume opera designed to let his bloodier tendencies loose. Bursting with references both literary and cinematic this is del Toros ""The Age of Innocence"" by way of Jack Claytons ""The Innocents"" as brazenly over-the-top as those films were subtle manifesting a ghost story in which Wasikowskas Edith Cushing has far more to fear from the living than from the dead and the female of the species is deadlier than the male. An anomaly among the husband-hunting bachelorettes of turn-of-the-century Buffalo N.Y. Edith would rather write fiction -- specifically tales of the supernatural -- than attend fancy high-society balls. Though a skeptic toward romance she believes in ghosts having received a mortifying visit from her late mother (played by ""Pans Labyrinth"" creep Doug Jones) while still a young girl. At the time she doesnt put much stock in the wraiths warning -- ""Beware of Crimson Peak"" hisses the incongruously computer-generated apparition -- and she remains far more open-minded toward the undead than any of her altar-bound peers would be. Thatll come in handy more than an hour later when she finally gets to Crimson Peak a crumbling British mansion perched atop a heap of blood-red clay. But first she has to fall in love which poses a unique challenge for del Toro. As with the heroine that he and co-writer Matthew Robbins have created his literary role model is more Mary Shelley than Jane Austen. The helmer seems far more comfortable noodling around in the audiences collective subconscious where fears lurk and desire festers than dealing with something as straightforward as pure romantic attraction and though hes attempted to create a triangle between Edith and two differently alluring men hardy local doc Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) and obsequious British baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) it seems pretty clear that shed be better off sticking to her principles and avoiding such entanglements altogether. And yet del Toro takes his time with Sharpes seduction as if the director who can make people faint from fright were trying to prove to himself that he can get them to swoon as well. Just waitll you get to the sex scenes. Neither love nor lust comes easily to del Toro despite a charming enough ballroom setpiece in which Edith and Sharpe test whether they can waltz in circles without extinguishing a lit candle while the baronets raven-haired sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain alarmingly miscast) smolders in sync from behind the piano. Somethings not quite right between these two siblings and cinemas should comp the tickets of all who divine what the trouble is before Sharpe marries Edith against the objections of her aristocracy-phobic father (""Deadwoods"" Jim Beaver) and whisks his new bride off to the very place her dead mother so directly warned her not to visit. (Following his revoltingly brutal murder ghost-dad should probably pay Edith a visit as well if only to tell her who it was that smashed his skull in.) Sharpe may or may not love Edith but he definitely likes her money which he needs to finance a noisy contraption that digs that gross clay out from Crimson Peak. While America land of Thomas Edison was lit all in gold and bronze tones back home in Sharpes native Britain things look infinitely more somber the gloom pierced by almost fluorescent stabs of light -- a look d.p. Dan Lausten clearly borrowed from the Dario Argento playbook (one the film itself dubs ""gothic a la Italiana""). Ornate in the extreme with entire rooms dedicated just to moths and a forbidden basement full of burbling blood-red clay vats the Sharpes mausoleum-like home appears to be an LSD-spiked Technicolor-nightmare version of Manderley as featured in Hitchcocks ""Rebecca."" Cued by Fernando Velazquezs wonderfully eerie score one can practically feel the specter of past wives hanging about the place -- theyre plainly visible to Edith as they lurk behind closed doors and waft up through floorboards like projections from Disneys Haunted Mansion ride. Love may have hobbled her intellect but Edith remains a reasonably smart young woman All it takes is a reminder visit from her dead mom and a nasty fit of coughing up blood to realize that something is amiss. And her intuition is better than del Toros who never should have chosen Chastain While the actress expanded her strong wholesome image by crossing over to the dark side in last years ""A Most Violent Year"" the role of Lucille requires a streak of vicious insecurity and black-widow ruthlessness that Chastain flounders to convey. ""Crimson Peak"" demands a witchier -- or at least bitchier -- actress to go all Mrs. Danvers on Edith. (Parker Posey comes to mind though Hiddlestons ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" co-star Tilda Swinton would have made a delicious alternative.) Deprived of her own crimson locks Chastain cant even manage the British accent and the characters psychotic break ultimately ruptures the pics last shred of credibility. By contrast with her pale porcelain-doll face and long blonde tresses the appropriately cast Wasikowska practically glows in the dark as she takes candelabra in hand and goes looking for the haunted houses secrets. Still less setup and a lot more exploring would have done wonders as the mansion is by far the films main attraction -- the brainchild of del Toro and production designer Tom Sanders whose work on ""Bram Stokers Dracula"" was an ideal warm-up for the gig. As it happens del Toro (together with co-writer Robbins) already has a far more effective haunted-house picture under his belt the Troy Nixey-directed ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" (a movie that while scripted for a PG-13 landed an R from the MPAA for sheer intensity). Though the director takes clear delight in being free to operate in adults-only mode here the tonal mismatch between visual beauty and Grand Guignol gore -- an oculus rift if ever there was -- yields revulsion rather than fright. He errs by opening the film with a flash-forward that assures us Edith will survive and delivers the films only real scare in the very next scene when her mom first visits. It hardly matters that ""Crimson Peak"" blossoms into del Toros most sumptuous film as theres no recovering from the fact the suspense crimson-peaks too early.

Trent says January 4 2016 at 1029 pm ""Crimson Peak"" has haunted my imagination - its a truly gorgeous almost operatic film. Loved the performances from Mia Wasikowska Tom Hiddelston and Jessica Chastain. The story and characters are archetypal think dream-logic - ala fairy tales Symbolist movement etc. - or dont think at all just luxuriate in the images music and emotion allow yourself to be swept along. This reviewer was on some other wavelength completely but thats not surprising (Ive read some of his other reviews). You really should see the film for yourself - its very special. For those who appreciate gothic romance and visual storytelling this is perhaps the ultimate statement. Reply carterfrancis says March 14 2016 at 1123 pm Needed a better screenplay. Reply Chinyere says December 4 2015 at 904 am I LOVED every minute of Crimson Peak. In the past I used to device a formula (big mistake) by which I would read critics reviews before viewing a film - a method to shield me and my time from a lot of mediocrity and blatant nonsense being fed viewers these days. Then The Chronicles of Riddick happened. The critics were cruel and had a field day with that effort but I viewed it anyway and would have greatly regretted it if I hadnt. The Chronicles of Riddick continues to pull a cult gathering even as I write this piece. I guess one mans trash is another mans treasure. Some critics have also trashed Crimson Peak - a treasure of a film. The Directors brilliance shines through this gorgeous piece of artistry. Its a great film. Reply Wayne says October 21 2015 at 219 pm Good God... Couldnt you have just said that you didnt like it instead of putting us through the endless minutes of your own self-absorption? Reply Mr.Doc says October 19 2015 at 921 pm As a review this is more a synopsis. An extremely unfair thing to do to movie lovers who want to but as yet have not seen the movie. Reply Liv Toride says October 19 2015 at 653 pm Crimson Peak was an excellent movie and I just pre-ordered the DVD already People please dont listen to negativity..... just go see it and form your own opinion. Reply sian says October 19 2015 at 631 am I think the problem with Crimson Peak is a lot of people expected a visceral horror film but despite some gory moments its far more subtle than that Its beautifully shot gorgeous to look at and the performances are faultless especially Hiddleston who manages to say a lot without uttering a word. The real scares are psychological and I suspect too many people overlooked that and instead wanted simply a lurid gore trip. And of course in order to attract audiences at the weekend everything must be family friendly. I personally loved it its a shame that an undoubtedly enjoyable but probably empty kid flick like Goosebumps will be the bigger hit. Reply Kathy Kudzma says October 17 2015 at 1121 am Did the reviewer and I watch the same movie? I loved how creepy it was and the Gothic romance. The actors and actresses have great performances. I loved the sister -- wanted her gone halfway through the movie. Loved Hiddleston -- his sad smile implying that even though he has a plan with his sister that he might not want to go through with it... At the end even though Thomas was a villain I was still hoping he would be with Edith... Really good engaging fantastic sets and costumes. Good movie -- for what it is. Would watch again. Reply Linda says October 16 2015 at 705 pm I had been waiting to see this now I wish I had waited a bit longer to read the reviews. I started to get worried because usually when they announce it a lot on tv it is never a good thing. I went to see it and was so disappointed people were actually laughing and the story line was so obvious that I knew what was going to happen and as for scary ha not in the least. Reply Daniela says October 16 2015 at 304 pm ""Following his revoltingly brutal murder..."" spoilers much? Will not read a Variety review again. Reply Martin Wagner says October 16 2015 at 1131 am This review 100% NAILS everything wrong with this movie especially noting the one crippling plot flaw that demolishes its internal logic everybodys ghosting all over the place and yet for some reason Ediths father never appears to her to tell her who his killer was. And Edith who is introduced as an intelligent independent self-assured proto-feminist woman with no patience for societys norms immediately turns off her brain and becomes a swooning helpless damsel the instant Hiddles walks into the room totally oblivious to his obvious scheming and eager to sign away the family fortune. This movie was a big beautiful package with nothing inside. Crimsons Weak. Reply Gumby says January 5 2016 at 839 pm Crimson Weak indeed a 100% hokey dumb film Reply Chris says October 15 2015 at 1040 pm Youre completely off your rocker about Jessica Chastain. She was an excellent choice. Hated her damn character but that was the point. Im so glad I only pay mind to idiotic reviews after Ive gone and seen the movie myself. One persons crappy opinion shouldnt stop others from forming their own. Reply Liv Toride says October 19 2015 at 640 pm I couldnt agree with you more Reply Joey says October 15 2015 at 750 pm I feel like people give movies a bad review JUST so they can label their article with the cockiest smart ass title they can possibly think up. That and its very obvious outta all the reviews Ive read who actually understands what a Gothic romance is supposed to be like. Reply Sean Brodrick says October 15 2015 at 741 pm I feel like we didnt see the same film. Crimson Peak is wonderful. I hope people ignore your awful review and go see the movie then decide for themselves. Reply kiki says October 15 2015 at 236 pm are you sure that mortifying is the right word? Unless there was something really embarrassing about her moms ghost visiting... Reply Leo says October 18 2015 at 533 am This movie was absolutely ridiculous I paid 32 to see this drivel on IMAX I was expecting a real ghost story a la Devils Backbone instead we got a gothic Gone with the Wind saga Booooring Reply Edgar Alberto Anolin says October 16 2015 at 926 am you know morbid and horrifying. mortifying. LOL Reply James says October 14 2015 at 906 pm Odd. After ragging on Jessica Chastain (who other reviewers have said was fantastic in the role) you mention nothing about the other performances. Was Hiddleston believable? Hunnam? Mia W.? You say she glows and glides but nothing about the acting of anyone. Way to much complaining about the sets/atmosphere and not enough substance about the other elements that make up the film. Its a gothic romance with supernatural overtones not a horror movie. You sound like you made up your mind before you even saw the film. If youve been doing this job for too long take a vacation or give someone else a chance. This kind of review isnt helpful. Reply The Colonel says October 14 2015 at 846 pm Jesus Peter. That review is nearly incomprehensible. Seriously I had to look to see who wrote it because I could not believe that one of the Hollywood reporter regulars turned this out. Did anybody look at this before you posted it? Its seriously below par. Reply Persephone says October 14 2015 at 231 pm I feel like the writer of this review has watched far too many terrible mid 2000s jump scare horror films and has now declared that as horror. Id politely suggest watching some actual horror films and to stop using a thesaurus to write your reviews as it doesnt come across as the reviewer knowing what hes discussing in the slightest despite apparently being the chief film critic for Variety. If all youre looking for is a lack of suspense and cheap thrills like in an action film an actual film with thought will disappoint you. You should be watching the sort of explosion laden gun toting violence flick that seems to permeate modern movie theatres. Many other reviewers are calling this film Hitchcockian and a beautifully dark horror -- and a masterpiece of modern cinema. Instead of making terrible ending attempts at puns in an article Id maybe consider gaining a deeper scope of horror and suspense before simply discussing Edith as a character throughout the piece and dismissing the rest of the film entirely because he just doesnt understand the difference between horror and actual horror. Reply Sean McMahon (seanmcm) says October 14 2015 at 228 pm bit strange to complain that a Guillermo del Toro picture is a... Guillermo del Toro picture. Reply laarviso says October 14 2015 at 209 pm The only thing wallowing in self importance is this verbal diarrhoea thats passing itself as a review. Its just a bitchy rant. Reply Bobbi says October 14 2015 at 755 am I read your review twice and have absolutely NO IDEA what you said. Would you mind explaining this to us again in 10 words or less and disregard the thesaurus? Thanks abunch....

Guillermo del Toro said this is not a horror story. Sorry but you suck as a critic. Reply Ari Drew (TheAriDrew) says October 13 2015 at 250 pm off the mark Reply Ari Drew (TheAriDrew) says October 13 2015 at 249 pm Fantastic film and couldnt disagree more. I think the expectation from this reviewer was very of the mark. The film does what it sets out to do quite beautifully. Its not shit-your-pants scary because it never sets out to be. It is definitely gorgeous and very haunting though. Reply Thetoxicavenger says October 13 2015 at 213 pm The trailer made it look like it was not scary at all. That ""oh youre brainwashed to only like jump scares"" argument is getting old. There were jump scares in the shining. Didnt make it any less atmospheric. Reply Marie says October 14 2015 at 523 pm The film is suppose to be creepy not scary. Reply Ravendark says October 13 2015 at 153 pm Every time a truly gothic movie comes along its always the same bullshit from critics. Some people dont want jump scares in their horror movies. Rich atmospheric stories that are more haunting than scary are in short supply- its exactly why I have been waiting for this film for over a year now. The fact that its closer to Devils Backbone is the highest endorsement anyone could make. While I adore Pans Labyrinth as an exception Del Toro has really lost his way in recent projects. Reply Ken says October 13 2015 at 152 pm This review seems to confirm what Id been feeling after watching all the not-especially-gripping trailers all pricey surface gloss with hoary old (and minimal) scares. Ill wait for this on VOD. In the meantime think Ill run THE INNOCENTS again. Reply LOL says October 13 2015 at 122 pm May as well have remade Jan de Bonts The Haunting because it looks to be mining the same territory. Reply wiles11 says October 13 2015 at 916 pm I can only hope you realize that de Bonts ""The Hunting"" is itself a remake of a VASTLY superior film? Reply Dan says October 13 2015 at 121 pm Ya know Crimson Peak isnt actually a horror movie its a gothic romance and there is a difference. Reply Martin Wagner says October 16 2015 at 1134 am Its still badly written with no suspense or logic. Reply Lara says October 13 2015 at 1112 am From the clips I`ve seen and as a Brit I can tell you that Chastain`s English accent was pretty much spot on. Reply Fish Walls says October 13 2015 at 1049 am A little bit racist isnt it Debruge? Reply lilibetp says October 13 2015 at 455 pm How was it racist Fish Walls? Reply Gerrixx Ovvarc says October 13 2015 at 1048 am I agree Cece lt;3 Another bad review... hopefully people will ignore it and go have the amazing time this movie is. Reply Cece Ovvarc says October 13 2015 at 1047 am Annoying review on account we having already seen it. Very disappointed because the movie was one of those you want to see a few times over and the buzz from others who have seen it is very good. Reply Fish Walls says October 13 2015 at 1149 am That review has racist themes spun in the review. I wouldnt take it seriously. Reply Brian Lewis says October 13 2015 at 1044 am Already got my tickets... I cant wait to see it. Reply Gerrixx Ovvarc says October 13 2015 at 1043 am This was an amazing film Ill be seeing it a few times more. If you enjoyed Pans Labyrinth and The Devils backbone definitely go see it.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Crimson Peak may end up being brought down by its own marketing but to be fair its a difficult movie to sell. Billed as a haunted-house horror movie its actually a violent R-rated romance geared toward the sensibilities of ""14-year-old bookish girls"" as director Guillermo Del Toro described it in a recent preview screening. As in Del Toros chilling The Devils Backbone the apparitions represent the sins of the past writ here on a familial instead of a national scale. As such theyre more tragic than terrifying which on the one hand perfectly fits the swooning Gothic atmosphere. On the other this means the scariest scenes of the movie appear early on with diminishing thrills after that. Mia Wasikowska stars as American heiress Edith Cushing an aspiring author who in a particularly on-the-nose bit of dialogue is described as ""our very own Jane Austen"" to which she replies ""Id prefer to be Mary Shelley."" While typing up one of her stories at her wealthy industrialist fathers office Edith meets Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston looking appropriately anemic) an English baronet who retains his ancestral title if not the family fortune. Although shes more fond of reading than dancing Edith falls quickly for the romantic penniless aristocrat and he and his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) wriggle their way into the Cushings social circle. Soon Thomas proposes to Edith and whisks her away to his ancestral home Allerdale Hall where she must contend with nightly visits from mournful ghosts as well as Lucilles thin-lipped hatred.Chastains performance--icy-cold unblinking and perpetually teetering on the edge of deranged--is a highlight. (A scene where she feeds porridge to a helpless Wasikowska painfully scraping a metal spoon against a ceramic bowl as she calmly describes her abusive fathers violent outbursts is particularly masterful.) The other leads cant match Chastains intensity however even though Del Toro and co-writer Matthew Robbins give Wasikowska plenty to do by inverting the damsel-in-distress trope. (Hiddleston who tellingly flashes the films only nudity mostly serves as a plot device.) Like many of the themes this inversion is conveyed so deliberately it comes across as overwritten and the script is laden with heavy-handed foreshadowing and a psychosexual twist many viewers will see coming long before it happens.Unsurprisingly for a Del Toro film the production design is the real star of Crimson Peak; the director says his budget was 50 million but it looks like it cost more. The attention to detail is consistently impressive with period-accurate Victorian sets and jewel-toned lighting creating an aesthetic best described as ""Disneys Haunted Mansion ride as designed by Mario Bava."" The costumes in particular ought to attract awards-season attention outfitting Wasikowska in white nightgowns that play up her porcelain-doll looks and Chastain in sumptuous silk and velvet. The design of the house itself and its ghostly inhabitants is equally thoughtful Allerdale Hall is built atop a deposit of valuable red clay for example producing blood-red footprints in the snow and the wispy plumes of smoke emanating from the restless spirits perfectly mimic the leaves that gently fall through a hole in the dilapidated manors ceiling. Against such a beautifully realized backdrop perhaps any story would appear inadequate.

The insanely lush Gothic romance and ghost story plays like a hitherto unrecorded collaboration between Edgar Allan Poe Edith Wharton the designers of Disneylands Haunted Mansion and whoever directed all those Bonnie Tyler music videos in the 1980s. And while the film boasts a talented ensemble lets give credit to the films real star costume designer Kate Hawley (""Edge of Tomorrow"") who drapes the innocent Edith (Mia Wasikowska) and the duplicitous Lucille (Jessica Chastain) in dresses and nightgowns that perfectly match del Toros directorial style here insanely overdone yet perfectly appropriate. See Video Guillermo del Toros Crimson Peak Trailer Features Lots of Creeps Haunting Mia Wasikowska Del Toro who also co-wrote with frequent collaborator Matthew Robbins pays homage to the British horror movies made by Hammer Films in the 1950s and 60s and ""Crimson Peak"" offer fitting tribute down to the long sequences where people wander up and down creepy hallways in between scare moments. Defenders of the recent ""Godzilla"" reboot justified that films delayed gratification as an homage-based decision but del Toro and Robbins at least give audiences something to look at and think about while were waiting for the next money shot. Wasikowskas Edith Cushing -- named for Hammer star and eventual ""Star Wars"" supporting cast member Peter Cushing -- is an odd duck amid high-society girls in 1901 Buffalo N.Y.; shes a writer even though her haunted tales are rejected by publishers who think women should write only romances. Edith has cause to be interested in the supernatural however since she was visited as a child by the ghost of her late mother who warned her to beware of something called Crimson Peak. While her father Carter (Jim Beaver) would like to see Edith pair off with her childhood friend optometrist Alan McMichael (Charlie Hunnam) her head is turned by visiting British baronet Thomas Sharpe (Tom Hiddleston) who sweeps the sheltered young girl off her feet under the watchful eye of his sister Lucille. Carter doesnt get the chance to share with Edith what he has learned about the Sharpes before she is whisked off to their estate in England built atop a mine producing clay so red that the floors bleed crimson. Production designer Tom Sanders and his team have created the mother of all haunted houses complete with a dramatic staircase rickety elevator rusty pipes a hole in the ceiling through which leaves (and later snow) fall to the floor of the foyer and both an attic and a basement Edith is warned to avoid. (Lucille skulks around like Mrs. Danvers in ""Rebecca"" wielding a massive set of keys to all the rooms.) The more Edith learns about who she married and why shes really there and what spirits still possess this terrifying home the more she wants to escape. But when winter comes bringing snow that absorbs the color of the clay beneath she discovers that Crimson Peak more than merits her late mothers dire warnings. Also Read Charlie Hunnam Still Regrets Pulling Out of Fifty Shades of Grey I Was Having Panic Attacks The sight of Wasikowska -- looking like a Botticelli goddess in a puffy-sleeved brocaded nightgown hair streaming down on both sides clutching a candelabra -- clearly pushes del Toros Gothic-horror buttons and he shares that delight with audiences; when she eventually throws open the doors to the house only to face a great whoomp of snow and wind its hard not to shriek with delight and its at that operatically unrestrained level that ""Crimson Peak"" works best. These actors have been called upon to play archetypes and they do so brilliantly. The Buffalo sequence plays like ""The Age of Innocence"" with Alan and Thomas battling for Ediths attention at dances and dinners. Once in England Thomas and Lucille share any number of foreboding stares while Edith pieces together their true intentions. (Beaver the principal casts one American actor playing an American character imbues the father with enough genuine spirit and paternal affection to keep him from being merely a plot device.) See Video Tom Hiddlestons Robert De Niro Impression Gets Round of Applause From Robert De Niro Fans expecting wall-to-wall gut-bucket phantasmagoria may be surprised to see how much time del Toro gives to the love triangle and to the slow accumulation of the films creepy atmosphere. While the digital effects are undeniably contemporary ""Crimson Peak"" is otherwise a period homage that mostly plays like a period film rarely giving in to contemporary notions of pacing and payoff. When the scares do arrive however theyre effectively unsettling. Only once or twice does the film indulge in cheesy jump effects where the audience flinches because of a sudden LOUD noise. Instead you can feel the director savoring the anticipation and then resolving it skillfully and grandly. The result is del Toros best film since ""Pans Labyrinth"" one that should rightly become a staple for many Halloweens to come. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
