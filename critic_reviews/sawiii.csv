Despite the twisted imagination he and his protege Amanda (Shawnee Smith) lavish upon their ingenious engines of pain there are no scares or suspense to speak of and the screams are starting to sound thin. Although the perverse master/pupil dynamic is explored to some effect the complicated flashback structure is more confusing than enlightening the hyper-kinetic images more agitating than exciting. Debilitated by a brain tumour Jigsaw abducts depressed brain surgeon Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) and forces her to Black and Decker his skull while wearing an explosive collar linked to his heart monitor. Fully conscious throughout Jigsaw amuses himself by monitoring the tests he has devised for Jeff (MacFadyen) an alcoholic consumed by fantasies of vengeance since his son was killed in a car accident. As the overwrought puzzle plot is strained to breaking point the sole point of interest is the teasing (probably disingenuous) hint that this attenuated instalment might be the last of the series.

In Saw III a man consumed with vengeance over his dead child is asked to play a stomach-turningly vile game. The judge who let the killer off easy lies chained at the bottom of a pit. The vengeful man (Angus Macfayden) has the ability to let him go but until then a series of giant rotting pig carcasses -- they have veins like blue cheese -- begins to wheel around on an assembly line of horror. Fed into whirring blades the carcasses spill over the judge drowning him in a putrid river of liquefied hog guts. Until that is he is saved -- a victory for compassion over vengeance Admit it Its not every horror film that can make you feel preached at and slimed at the same time. Saw III is constructed as a game within a game. Tobin Bell who plays the psycho behind the papier-mache harlequin puppet Jigsaw has now been elevated to tragic-leading-man status. Dying from a brain tumor Bell lies in bed in what looks like a smeary hospital for Nazi experiments assisted by Amanda (Shawnee Smith) his victim/accomplice from Saw II who helps him create the ultimate sick challenge. It involves putting a physician (Bahar Soomekh) in a suicide-bomb collar and having her perform brain surgery on him as he lies awake. How any of this connects to that other game pig guts and all made for some avid postfilm head-scratching on the multiplex escalator. Thats what happens when you try to pass off a blood feast as a morality play. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Photo credit Steve Wilkie Photo Steve Wilkie Bedridden Jigsaws minion carries on killing in Saw III 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Saw III Drama. Starring Tobin Bell Shawnee Smith  Dina Meyer and Angus Macfadyen. Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman . (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) The success of the ""Saw"" franchise shouldnt be a huge surprise to anybody. Its the perfect movie for people who spent their childhood pulling the wings off flies and incinerating ants with a magnifying glass -- but never got around to becoming serial killers themselves. But as the creators of ""The X-Files"" learned and the people behind ""Lost"" are going to find out soon you can only jerk around an audience -- even a demented and loyal one -- for so long before they start screaming in frustration and move on to something else. ""Saw III"" will surely make a gazillion dollars but this could be that breaking point for a lot of horror fans. While ""Saw"" and ""Saw II"" were pretty good splatter films hampered by spectacularly unbelievable endings ""Saw III"" is annoying for almost the duration of the movie. And worse yet the writers have set up a ""Saw IV"" even though the Jigsaw Killer and his crazy accomplice appear to have hacked through the casts of these movies until theres no one left to kill. For those who have missed out on the phenomenon -- and maybe youre better off for it -- the ""Saw"" trilogy doesnt take a lot of explaining. A cancer-ravaged serial killer (Tobin Bell) puts people he doesnt like in complicated traps where the only escape is by self-mutilation (hacksawing off a leg digging in an eye socket for a key etc.). When they fail theyre executed usually by some sort of giant bear trap or explosion that spreads their entrails across the room. In ""Saw II"" the bedridden Jigsaw Killer picked up an apprentice (Shawnee Smith) who carries out his plans. Thats where ""Saw III"" begins and it doesnt go much of anywhere until the infuriating last 10 minutes when everything is sort of tied together while still producing more unanswered questions. The movie seems at times to be told in random order often with flashbacks and the closest thing to a plot is a weak story about the father who keeps confronting the people responsible for his sons drunken-driving death. With one brutal torture killing after the other and almost no context the first half of the movie plays like the horror version of a Pink Floyd greatest hits album. This is a film for people who miss the ""Faces of Death"" video series and like their scary movies to come as close to an NC-17 as the ratings board will allow. But the violent content isnt the problem in ""Saw III."" This time around screenwriter Leigh Whannell seems to be almost taunting the audience with the lack of realism in the script. For example one incredibly large and intricate torture device in this movie couldnt have been made without four or five subcontractors but were supposed to believe a mentally unbalanced ex-junkie who weighs 100 pounds put it together in at most a few months. Whannell bless his heart does wrap up a few loose ends from the previous films. But its a mistake to let the Jigsaw Killer take on a sympathetic Hannibal Lecter vibe in ""Saw III"" -- which doesnt really work when he continues to dunk people in vats of acid for almost no reason. Nothing ruins a cinematic bloodbath quicker than a serial killer who develops a conscience. -- Advisory This film contains full frontal nudity but youll barely notice with all the decapitations eviscerations and exploding body cavities (sometimes in the same scene). Take your preteen child to this movie at your own risk -- I have Child Protective Services on speed dial.

This strategy hardly seems the best course to sustain a horror franchise but with nearly everybody dead at the end pics 3150-screen Halloween weekend may prove to be a whopping farewell to a stunning moneymaker for Lionsgate. Unlike the disturbingly mysterious original ""Saw III"" is a neatly wrapped-up package that explains everything -- including Jigsaws evil contraptions and the background of his crazed female assistant. This strategy hardly seems the best course to sustain a horror franchise but with nearly everybody dead at the end -- despite the hint of another sequel -- pics 3150-screen Halloween weekend may prove to be a whopping farewell to a stunning moneymaker for Lionsgate. With moralistic mastermind of torture Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) set free in dubious health in ""Saw II"" the new edition returns to Donnie Wahlbergs ill-fated cop Eric having to chop off his foot to free himself from chains and irons. This marks just one of several flashbacks that eventually hinder the movie ratcheting down its tension and pace. Another even more dogged cop Kerry (Dina Meyer) is back but not for too long as shes captured and killed in a diabolical contraption that rips her torso to shreds. Whats missing this time however is a gaming aspect that called for Jigsaw to torture only the victims he deemed worthy of punishment. Key ""Saw III"" victim is ER surgeon Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) who is stressed over her failing marriage. Snatched from her hospitals locker room Lynn revives in Jigsaws lab of horrors where Jigsaw lies close to death with an inoperable brain tumor. Jigsaws high-strung assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) locks the usual ""Saw""-esque device on Lynn this one a neck brace triggered to detonate if Jigsaws heart rate flatlines. So if Lynn wants to live she must keep Jigsaw alive. Unlike either first pics dominant white-tiled set imprisoning two victims or the follow-ups less effective use of a house of horrors ""Saw III"" jumps from Lynns predicament to that of Jeff (Angus MacFadyen). Jeff is targeted by Jigsaw rather unfairly for wanting revenge on the driver who accidentally killed his 8-year-old son. Still-grieving dad finds himself trapped in a crate. He escapes only to find hes in a warehouse with one of Jigsaws torture ""games"" behind every door. Pics most blood-curdling scene is when Lynn drills into Jigsaws skull which suggests that the franchises exploitative use of torture to make an aud squirmy has lost its effect. A bigger problem lies with Leigh Whannells script which utilizes so many flashbacks and explanatory inserts that the tension a defining feature of the first ""Saw"" is lost. By the time Amanda realizes that she is the real subject of Jigsaws current game another rapid flashback sequence a la ""Saw II"" is needed to put all the pieces together. This wrapping up of all the loose ends unfortunately leaves little that could be used to construct another sequel. With the superb gravelly-voiced Bell now mostly confined to a bed more of the load is on Smith who is not as effective in the nasty department. MacFadyen delivers a strong almost silent performance that conveys a pained fathers dark night of the soul while Soomekh (the distressed Iranian daughter in ""Crash"") is reasonably convincing as the surgeon. Dark ghoulish look of ""III"" is identical to ""II"" thanks to production designer David Hackl (who also handled latter) and lenser David A. Armstrong (who has been with ""Saw"" since the beginning). Whats been sacrificed is the originals distinctive use of bright lights and white sets which ran so counter to conventional expectations in a horror pic.

"Predictable gross Saw III is the unkindest cut so far - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Predictable gross Saw III is the unkindest cut so far By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 28 2006 The Daytime Emmys arent until next spring but for the voters consideration Id like to submit the stars of ""Saw III."" Yes I know the Emmys are for television but whom are we kidding? Television is a state of mind. And the makers of ""Saw III"" have delivered the most despicable episode of ""One Life to Live"" ever. Amid the nasty dilemmas (Hmmm? To dive into a vat of pig guts to save the drowning judge who sentenced the driver who killed my son or not?) are shouting matches and cry-athons at the deathbed of an extremely talkative person.The Chatty Cathy is none other than John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer the most moralizing serial killer in the history of horror. Hes still dying of a brain tumor and hes still not thrilled about it. But as in the first two movies hes using his impending demise to make miserable people wish they had stopped and smelled the roses.For the occasion hes devised a new plot. A depressed surgeon (Bahar Soomekh) and a depressed dad (Angus Macfayden) the very one considering that dip in pig guts are brought to Jigsaws slaughterhouse. The doctor has to keep Jigsaw alive or her head will explode. Of course if the dad gets his revenge on his sons killer (whos also been snared by Jigsaw) shes free to go.The guy who wrote the first two installments and the one who directed ""Saw II"" are responsible for ""Saw III."" And whats remarkable about these movies is how much the craftsmanship degrades with each episode. This is a long scrambled indifferently made affair. Theres no rhythm to the sequencing.Naturally the movie is gross enough for Joe Rogan to be its host. But its melodramatic and predictable enough to be mistaken for an Agnes Nixon production. That poor surgeon finds herself locked in a jealous triangle with Jigsaw and his nutty assistant Amanda whom Shawnee Smith plays like she can smell that Emmy (the tears the rage the exposition). And Tobin Bell reprises his career-making role as Jigsaw. He bring a glint of wisdom to a part that here requires him to lie on his side while a co-star removes a chunk of his skull. Dont worry hes got a local anesthetic. You youll have to bring your own. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.
