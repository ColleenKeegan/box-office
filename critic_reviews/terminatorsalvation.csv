Isnt it romantic sending a future soldier back in time to protect the mother of the resistance (and also to fall in love with her)? Could there possibly be a better role for an Austrian bodybuilder than a cyborg? And who was this resourceful chick basically saving humanitys ass? The new Terminator Salvation brought to dour noisy life by Charlies Angels director McG prompts a different set of questions. When did Christian Bale playing the grown-up freedom fighter John Connor become such a humorless pill? Where exactly do survivors of the ""nuclear fire"" grow carrots? And wouldnt being punched in the face by a steel fist hurt a little? Its 2018 and the world lies in ruins--Hollywood too. But judging from Salvation certain elements of franchise resuscitation have survived the most boring ones. Giant robots cut down humans or go kaboom in nonthreatening digitized heaps. Connor a barker of orders and dull radio broadcasts still has to locate teenage Kyle Reese (Yelchin a winning Chekhov in Star Trek) and--yawn--infiltrate Skynet HQ. And theres another scruffy-bearded hunk Marcus (Worthington) who probably shouldnt be trusted seeing that he cant string an entire sentence together. Sadly people still listen to Guns N Roses cassettes in the wasteland; also a certain real-life California governor has been computerized and revived complete with his 1984 hair part. But missing is Camerons signature action modification best exploited in Aliens the strapping female heroine. McGs testosterone-juiced world feels a little doomed without her.--Joshua Rothkopf Opens Fri.

At the beginning it gives hints to the direction of Skynet and actually cracks the door to future movies about Skynet and how it gets off ground. The casting is really good as well having Christian Bale Anton Yelchin Sam Worthington Common etc. all paint a masterpiece in bringing this conceptual idea to a realistic possibility. There was one unnecessary point in the film where revealing Marcus the 1st skin covered robot could have been developed better. Such as when the Marcus had to rescue the pretty woman of the resistance Blair Williams from an eventual rape. Still it wasnt detrimental to the story. The apocalyptic setting of a future ravaged and controlled by near indestructible machines was awesome and believable. The war nearing its end due to the machines relentless efforts to annihilate the humans invite the viewers into the emotions of the hopeless resistance of going out fighting. The movie paves a road that leads towards the development of Kyle Reese in the eventual sequel. For Terminator fans this movie is really a breath of fresh air.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/terminator-salvation,200,terminatorsalvation0,terminatorsalvation,timeout

Christian Bales talents are wasted the plot is full of stilted dialogue and cringe-worthy sequences and the whole thing feels much more like a marketing experiment than a full-fledged feature film. Im not sure where the ideas got lost or how one could begin picking up the pieces but sadly were left with a film that looks great while being largely less filling. Its all kind of a bummer actually. The film starts with McGs longish opening credits heavily stylized and completely devoid of action. So were off to a rough start. Were then introduced to Marcus (Sam Worthington) a guy Im gonna go ahead and give some credit to for being somewhat redemptive. He doesnt make any obvious missteps as a ""back-from-the-dead"" executed murderer. Hes an interesting guy to watch and he does the most with his time on-screen. Helena Bonham Carter has a small role too and shes suitably creepy as she was asked to be. The problems start with Christian Bales John Connor. Clearly Bale is one of our tremendous talents but giving him this script was akin to only driving your Ferrari in school zones laden with speed bumps. Hes simply helpless to transcend the illogical and plodding material hes given. The film does look quite good gritty though crisp and the action sequences flow well. However McG goes to the well far too often on a technique I can only call ""fire and rain."" Its when its raining hard (so you know things are BAD) while random fires are also blazing (so you know things are DANGEROUS). I counted four separate sequences of fire-rain -- see if you can do any better. Its a really heavy-handed method that shouldnt have been needed. The throttle should have been kept firmly on the action pedal; instead were treated to huge helpings of melodrama and roided up grimaces. A decent non-spoiler example I can give you is Moon Bloodgoods entrance into the film; she takes off her fighter pilots helmet to reveal ... three solid feet of flowing black hair. It looks nice but its completely sugarcoated and silly. Are we to imagine gals look like ""ready to rock"" supermodels in the post-judgment day future? And why do we need the slow motion? Its as if McG purposefully attempted to appeal to the part of our cortex lacking any and all complex reasoning. It doesnt fit in a film that should be about termination. And terminating. But the biggest problem with Terminator Salvation is the fact that nothing happens. Yes there are a few great scenes of peril where the robots and the humans are squared off in consequential fury but thats only about 15 minutes of a film that runs over two hours. The rest of the time is spent on various idiotic subplots. Will the troops listen to John Connor? Who is this Marcus character? How is the timeline going to work given the participation of Kyle Reese? Arrgh it goes on and on and none of it is remotely interesting. The sound is great the explosions are great the look and feel could have been turned into something special. Its the words and plot that are huge negatives here. So no I cant recommend this to my dear Internet friends. I understand if you want to see it anyway -- its a summer action movie and thus almost a prerequisite of your participation in the film community. Sadly youre probably going to end up where I did. Wishing it was as good as Star Trek and thanking your lucky stars that Wolverine wasnt nearly as funny.

A breathlessly paced pulse-pounding desert escape it lasts about five minutes and single-handedly earns the movie an extra star as sleek robotic motorcycles pursue our heroes who are fleeing in an armour-plated pickup.But stretching interminably on either side of this set piece is an ideas wasteland more barren than any of the blasted post-apocalyptic landscapes in the movie. Terminator Salvation isnt the gritty futuristic blitzkrieg for which fans of the first two films have been salivating. It isnt even the slick entertaining Hollywood blockbuster most were realistically expecting. It is a shambolic deafening intelligence-insulting mess a crushing failure on almost all counts.Its the year 2018. Christian Bale (whose on-set ballistics seem even more laughable in context) plays John Connor self-prophesied leader of the human resistance against Skynet the machine which rules the planet following a nuclear apocalypse. Sam Worthington plays Marcus Wright a former Death Row inmate who harbours a dark secret.The plot comes straight from the hey wouldnt it be cool if... school of screenwriting scenes and incidents slam into one another with no logical context or motivation. The characters are neutral Bale growls and frowns Worthington frowns and pouts while other grime-spattered actors wander on screen look perplexed and are quickly forgotten. For kids under 14 or extremely undemanding adults Terminator Salvation might just pass muster as a temporary forgettable Friday night distraction. But for fans of the first two movies this is a disappointment of Phantom Menace proportions.

The action sequences arent fun its devoid of humor theres a serious lack of terminators and the story is absolutely terrible especially the end. It might as well have been a Mad Max film.I managed to sit through it and didnt feel like Id completely wasted my time so I sort of enjoyed myself and for that Ill give it two stars although as a terminator film it really deserves one.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 27 2010GARFOOLSFeaturedWhat is done now is that a screenplay is made that satisfies execs enough. A director is sourced and vfx crew is sourced...blahblah actors/ other crews. Whatever. What is wrong? They take good and bad apples and set them on a rotten tree. No one cares enough to sort out their mistakes. What mistakes? Any new ideas hung on an old tired event line(standard plotline) fail completely. They seem added on while the crud train rolls on. Thats whats wrong with the story/plot. Nextinteractions(ie dialogues/combats) dialogues should stem from the plot because the plot is poor the dialogue is too. Combat giant terminator cant kill its target why? The crap plot is bad and too rigid plus the director uses it to create tension it does in respect of logic being strained.Combatbike chase same thing applies. CombatT800 takes out Tmarcus with one heart punch heart punches john conner 20 metres connor ok.

Robots from the future are hunting down people who will bother them later. I kept waiting for the film to realize that... sadly it never did. Well okay Kyle Reese was on the hit list. Which means that the Skynet of the present (in the future) knows that Reese will cause trouble (in the past) by going back in time and fathering John Connor who in this movie seems to be a low level staffer but who is Im told going to save humankind (further in the future... or maybe in the past). So why doesnt Skynet just send a Terminator back to kill Reeses grandfather in WW2 or something (maybe they did or will do when they get around to it)? And if Skynet does have time travel capability why fight the resistance with the old clunk-a-naters? Why not send their best-o-naters (that they make in the future) back in time to stomp out the resistance (which will be lead by that genius John Connor at some point)? And if TIME TRAVEL is the key why isnt JC (thats John Connor) more interested in looking for the time machine? I kept waiting to see THAT in this film. I mean so what if Skynet kills Reese... Its only a problem if time travel works like it does in Back to the Future then JC will disappear as the past is changed and he ceases to have ever existed. But if were not dealing with BTTF time travel effects he can find the time machine and go back in time and stop Reese from being killed. But if Terminator time travel works like it does in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure then JC can just promise to invent a mega-powerful killer robot later send it back in time to just that moment and... poof it suddenly appears. Using that system the he could have a stud farm of killer robot babes all to himself. And why not really? But really the dirty little secret to the Terminator franchise is this John Connor will ultimately realize that if he DOES succeed in stopping Skynet from unleashing Judgement Day then that will prevent him from ever being born. So its in his own best interests to help Skynet along to that point even if it means everyone dies. Finally I think this movie should have ended with John Connor being turned into a cyborg.

But as an occasional action flick fan this movie wasnt all that bad. McGee was able to cover up the lack of a decent story with extremely well done CGI including new robots that we had only heard of and an extremely well done chase in the middle of the desert with Kyle Reese and Marcus Wright. At the very least I suggest you could see the movie for Sam Worthington. The void left my Arnie was  in my opinion filled by the performance of Sam. Christian Bale fans may be a bit dissapointed (as I was) but he does a good job considering the (Very) less number of lines that he had in the movie. Simply put the movie kind of clears the the bad taste that T3 left in my mouth but it come nowhere close to the ones by Cameron.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 25 2009Andy SFeaturedReally dont know what the negativity is about.

As a huge fan of the originsal 2 movies and thinking that the third was average I expected more from this latest installment. What a fool I was This film not only insults our intelligence as an audience by literally throwing together a pile of so called wouldnt it be cool if this happened in a Terminator film... scenarios but it fails miserable where the other films succeed in that one does not care what happens to any of the characters. Wheres the humour? Wheres the constant impending doom? Wheres the story? The only bright light in this entire film is Sam Worthingtons performance as Marcus however the script dictates that unlike the other Terminator films you dont really care if he ends up on the metal scrap yard at the end. Save your money by not buying an over priced cinema ticket and go rent out the originals.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 19 2009OliverFeaturedThe film was ok/pretty good somewhere in between the two. Very different kind of film to the first 2 (im going to ignore no. 3) The story is ok the characters are ok but lacking in the depth department a little some good scenes that terminator fans will like a would have prefered a little less cgi on the terminators i think.

Its full of action and awesome special effects but more than that it is a drama of humanity and hope. I would have liked to give this film four stars but on reflection I do feel that the ""twist"" relies on rather stretched explanations of the earlier events of the film (e.g. why wasnt the secret mission accomplished earlier in a more direct manner? why did it have to entail such huge risk?). It would also have been nice to have more of a build-up to the opening scenes. Im not sure if this is fair as these thoughts didnt occur to me while I was watching the film last night- earlier this morning I was planning on giving the film four stars. But three stars it shall have because there are elements of the film which are not watertight in terms of believability on careful reflection. I should add that Ive never bought into the whole time-travel thing which gets a reference in the film and that may make my judgement of this film unfairly critical. I cant understand how the official reviewers could give this film a mere 2 stars and even then attributing one of them to a chase scene and then give 3 stars to the abysmal Drag Me To Hell. It really makes me wonder whether I can get any worthwhile guidance from the official reviews at all. Comparing this film to Phantom Menace is a travesty. Semi-Spoiler alert- this is an uplifting story of hope and humanity and explores the premise of logic versus instinct. Ultimately it is the story of the [moral] salvation of one man rather than the salvation of humanity as a whole. Also theres something inherently hilarious about seeing the current governor of California in the buff in a contemporary film even if he doesnt say much.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJun 15 2009PeterFeaturedI yawned I laughed I cried I changed some pop corn into wind I drank some soda - nice soda I must say.

The movie trailer sums up the first hour or so of the film. Stand out lines from the first two films were repeated and made to sound cheesy. Cast was poor possibly too many to be interested in. Effects were McG Charlies Angels styled and failed to impress - wasted budget. Where the film does start to pick up it fails to sustain any interest. Too many strong elements from first 2 films only to be weakend and made laughable in this one.

Its not like Terminator 3 which is basically a re-hash of 2 its future setting gives it a fresh and diferent feel. Infact this movie wipes the floor with the terrible T3 and any fan of the series will enjoy seeing Kyle Reese and the future he described to Sarah in the first movie presented stylishly before their eyes.

By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents Christian Bale as John Connor leads the resistance in the latest Terminator movie. Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka If you arrived late for ""Terminator Salvation"" and missed the name of the director at what moment would you realize that you were not watching a Mike Leigh film? I would nominate the scene in which a rusty tow truck armed with a wrecking ball is pursued by a riderless robot motorbike armed with automatic machine guns. A wrecked car falls into the bikes path at which point we are given privileged access to the display screen inside the robots brain. We get a blood-red projection of the obstacle ahead and with it for a second or two the words ""Analyzing alternatives."" Slide under the wreck crash through it or skirt around the side? I felt sorry for this anxious bike which may have been having trouble at home and it certainly delivers a more measured performance than some of the leading actors. Nonetheless that brief digital readout gives the game away. The business of the film is not to tell a cogent story or earn the devotion of our sympathies but to analyze alternatives and when in doubt pick whichever is louder. Take John Connor whose destiny is to lead the human resistance movement against the evil techno-empire of Skynet a defense system that ""became self-aware"" we are told and turned on its creators. In ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" Connor was played by Edward Furlong as wry resourceful and laid-back; in ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" he was played by Nick Stahl as a cocky wuss. And now in ""Terminator Salvation"" he is played by Christian Bale as a scar-nicked warrior consumed by a messianic belief that he can save the world by shouting. After the opening battle he answers his radio with yelps of ""Here"" and ""Connor"" as though introducing himself to a befuddled and very deaf grandmother. A notorious clip leaked to the Internet ahead of the films release showed Bale melting down on the set and bawling out a member of the crew but lets be fair; next to the finished product that lively address feels almost Edwardian in its courtesy. Connor is well matched in the decibel contest by the machines. We get snapping croconators metallic assailants that snake through rivers and try to eat a helicopter. As for those bikes (Bale has to mount one of them which he may have found rather demeaning after riding his nifty Bat-Pod in ""The Dark Knight"") they are launched from the shins of a giant Terminator which treads on a gas station as if trying to squash a roach. The films director McG who is clearly not content with the man-size killers of the previous movies has ordered the larger model; but it feels like a backward stomp already spoofed this season by the towering heavy of ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" and I fear about to be outcrunched by the vast villains of ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" the trailer for which is more exciting than McGs entire movie. At least Transformers have some color in their cheeks whereas this disheartening saga is tinted in duns umbers and unrelieved mouse-grays. There is a nice warm glow at the climax when a Terminator gets engulfed in molten metal but sadly the same thing happened to the T-1000 in ""T2"" and to be frank that liquid-orange look is so last century. All of which raises the question when and on what possible ground did someone decide that the Terminator franchise should be no fun to watch? Say what you like about Arnold Schwarzenegger but there was no mistaking the gleam in his eye--a searing scarlet gleam true but still a gleam. He like James Cameron knew precisely how much irony should be folded into the line readings and into the encounters between man and cyborg so as to leaven the sense of doom. That is now gone and ""Terminator Salvation"" is a confused humorless grind with nobody from the stars to the set designers prepared to prick its self-importance. The narrative device that propels characters across decades is still functioning at a pinch with Connor managing to be older than his own father (Anton Yelchin) which could prove awkward when they come to talk about sex and a condemned criminal named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) being reanimated after death and spirited to the year 2018 but its surely not a good sign when time travel gives you a sense of deja vu. In the words of one resister ""A person could go crazy thinking about all this."" By the end I felt as weary as the Terminator whom we meet in the bowels of Skynet and who for some reason wears a bandanna around his skull like Rafael Nadal. The poor wee thing. Is he hot? Would he like a glass of water? I know the machines are self-aware but this is ridiculous. If the owners of the Terminator brand ever wish to revisit the Teutonic route traversed in such crunching style by Schwarzenegger they should take a good look at Benno Furmann. His footsteps might not be as large as Arnies but he still cuts a forbidding figure with blue eyes that could easily double as lasers. In a new German film ""Jerichow"" he hardly ever starts a conversation preferring to speak only when spoken to--like a polite child or a prisoner in the dock. He doesnt move much either unless there are specific tasks to fulfill such as loading a truck or putting his hand in a womans mouth to stop her from crying out as they try to make silent love. (He bears a bite mark to prove it.) When he does shift a gear into violence it is over within seconds; watch him in a warehouse dodging a punch landing two hits of his own and tripping the other guy onto his back. At that point with equal neatness the writer-director Christian Petzold cuts away and we are left shaking and ringing as if we had just taken a blow ourselves. The early scenes of ""Jerichow"" are an object lesson in the slow release of dramatic information. Drop by drop this mans story accrues he is called Thomas he was with the German Army in Afghanistan his mother has just died he is living alone in her house and apart from that he has nothing. He seems to have arrived not at the end of his tether but simply at an end radiating dead calm where the rest of us might panic or collapse. I half-wanted this zero state to continue so that we could observe him explore its limits; instead the plot swings up as I guess it must to bar his way. He meets a local businessman a Turkish immigrant named Ali (Hilmi Sozer) who has a string of snack bars which he runs on a tight rein and a German wife Laura (Nina Hoss) who is no less under his command. Ali needs a driver--and you sense a friend--and Thomas fits the bill. You know what happens next. In particular if you know ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in either version or Luchino Viscontis ""Ossessione"" or the James M. Cain novel from which the three movies sprang the shape of the tale in which a drifter enters a dry marriage and starts a blaze might feel all too familiar. But those were hot numbers whereas Petzold the most cool-headed of the younger German directors has siphoned the steam out of the story. As in his previous film ""Yella"" with its stripped-back vision of the modern workplace the music and the editing are as sombre as the motions of the camera. Sex--curtailed despairing without a hint of raunch--is never the issue here. Laura and Thomas are not electing to be lovers but at a more basic level fighting to become living souls. At one point they hold hands in a dark wood like Hansel and Gretel. As for Ali Sozers careful performance deepens the role of the cuckold to a degree that none of the Cain movies could be bothered with. He is brutish and unhappy (brutish because unhappy) doing well from his adopted land yet lying low somehow as if he were an illegal refugee. No wonder he is given a diagnosis of a bad heart; it clearly belongs elsewhere. ""I live in a country that doesnt want me with a woman that I bought"" he says. That last detail refers to Lauras debts which he took on when he married her. Thomas too begins the movie among loan sharks and Petzold has remarked in a statement on the film that not until he viewed the finished work did he realize ""there is not a single scene in which money doesnt play a role."" In short ""Jerichow"" is the right movie at the right time--and with its dangerous stealth it unfolds in the right place too among the flat fields and the half-deserted roads of Jerichower Land in the former East Germany. Cash is tight (almost everyone Laura included tries to chisel Ali out of his profits) and employment is thin on the ground. Thomass first job before he joins Ali is to lie flat on a machine and pick cucumbers his face to the soil. Its as though Petzold had crushed ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" against ""The Grapes of Wrath"" film noir against the parched hopes of the Depression and transplanted what was left to an unregarded corner of northern Europe where the sunshine feels like a cruel joke. ""I love you Laura"" Thomas tells her. ""You cant love if you dont have money"" she says like someone rebuking the Beatles. So compact and controlled is this fine film with its bitter closing twist that against your instincts and despite your prayers you fear that she may be right.

Any character of consequence gets to unleash one and theres plenty to scream about. The Apocalypse aka Judgment Day has put an end to civilization. (The time is 2018 only nine years from now so go out and gather those rosebuds for goodness sake.) The few surviving members of a ragtag Resistance seem outmatched by Skynet a sentient network whose gigantic Terminator robots pluck people up without warning like claws grabbing little plush toys in arcade vending machines. Whats more the spectrum has been suppressed leaving only the grungiest hues for cinematographers to work with. Not a pretty picture and anything but an upper yet this fourth addition to the Terminator canon isnt entirely a downer either. Its a deafening sometimes boring occasionally startling and ultimately impressive war movie with a concern for what it is that makes us human. (Hint an organ but not the kind you would use to play Bach.) ENLARGE Christian Bale top plays John Connor in Terminator Salvation. Warner Bros. Things are so bad on our poor planet that the emerging leader of the Resistance John Connor laments ""This is not the future my mother warned me about"" Johns mom as you may recall from Linda Hamiltons previous agitations was not exactly Little Miss Sunshine. Ms. Hamilton makes a brief partially virtual reappearance while John previously portrayed by Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl is played this time by Christian Bale. Its a perfect choice since Mr. Bale is the primo sufferer of our time a performer with a subspecialty in emaciation (""Rescue Dawn"" ""The Machinist"") and a steady-state intensity compounded of pursed lips gimlet eyes and a doomy monotone that bespeaks an invisible chokehold. The revelation however is Sam Worthington. He plays Marcus a mysterious time-traveling stranger who may or may not be John Connors nemesis. Marcus suffers too frequently and loudly and the actor is no slouch as a primal screamer but Mr. Worthingtons specialty is taking command of the camera. (Later this year hell star in James Camerons ""Avatar."") Its fascinating to watch him dominate scene after scene with his coiled energy compelling voice and quick intelligence. To be thoroughly human on screen it helps to be a well-trained actor from Australia. Journal Community Discuss films and create topics in Joe Morgensterns movie group. Time travel along with alternate time branches is treated with a solemnity thats become obligatory in sci-fi plots even though as always its a logical absurdity. (My favorite phrase from the production notes deals with John Connors growing doubts ""that he may not live to initiate the events that will result in his own conception."") ""Im My Own Grandpa"" that deathless pop ditty from the 1940s made strict if quite simple sense. ""Terminator Salvation"" makes elaborate pseudo-sense but audiences will buy the film just as happily as they did the new ""Star Trek"" and why not; the Terminator mythology remains intact and the production delivers on its promise of an epic showdown between all-too-human flesh and much-too-precocious machinery. (The digital effects are mostly quite dazzling--not just the depictions of towering marauders and several visual references to the Holocaust but a memorably scary sequence in which a little serpentine robot thats been taken captive thrashes furiously to save its nonlife.) ""Terminator Salvation"" was directed by McG otherwise known as Joseph McGinty Nichol from a screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Martin Laing designed the production Shane Hurlbut photographed it and Danny Elfman composed the dreadful music. The cast includes Anton Yelchin as the teenage Kyle Reese (not his own grandpa but close) Bryce Dallas Howard and Helena Bonham Carter. Moon Bloodgood plays the beauteous Blair Williams the woman warrior Id most like to be with when civilization ends. Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian ENLARGE Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian above features Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria. Twentieth Century Fox Film ""Night at the Museum Battle of the Smithsonian"" is critic-proof; nothing I might say would have the slightest effect on its commercial fate. That leaves me free to marvel at the movies cheerful idiocy which seems definitive--even though the summer season has just begun--and at the efficiency with which the filmmakers have dumbed down a dumb premise of proven success. Theyve left nothing to chance by seeming to leave everything to chance. Compared to this chaotic sequel the 2006 ""Night at the Museum"" was as tightly structured as ""Law amp; Order."" When Amelia Earhart isnt flying the Wright brothers biplane--Amy Adams plays her as a pert variation on the theme of Katharine Hepburn--shes imploring Rodins newly rambunctious Thinker to sit down and think or chortling ""Great Gatsby"" as Abe Lincoln stands up shrugs the pigeons off his shoulders and ankles his marble monument. Ivan the Terrible insists he wasnt terrible which seems plausible in the context of a bloviating pharaoh with a Boris Karloff lisp three cherubs doing the love theme from ""Titanic"" General Custer riding a motorcycle a squirrel mistaking Steve Coogans tiny Octavius for a nut and Al Capone spending face time with a bunch of bobble-headed Einstein dolls. Repeat offenders include Robin Williams Owen Wilson Ricky Gervais and of course Ben Stiller whose Larry Daley has come up in the world since his gig as a museum guard. Have I made this sound enjoyable? Beware of idiocys charms. OHorten ENLARGE Bard Owe seated and Peder Lohne Hamer appear in OHorten. Sony Pictures Classic A single sequence in Bent Hamers ""OHorten"" tells us all we need to know about the power that the taciturn hero enjoys and will soon be forced to surrender. An engineer on the verge of retirement after 40 years Odd Horten sits serene at the controls of a sleek locomotive pulling a passenger train from Oslo to Bergen through a silent snowscape. In a literal sense this delightful film in Norwegian with English subtitles is about retirement and the prospect of loss. But Mr. Hamer a poet of the droll and askew sends the aptly named Odd--its also a common Norwegian name--on a cockeyed journey from regret through comic confusion to a lovely eagerness for new adventures. Odd whos played superbly by Bard Owe wears his age well as a young engineer tells him. And he wears the dapper leather jacket of his uniform long after his quietly hilarious retirement dinner where hes presented with a clunky trophy topped by a tiny silver locomotive. (Removing the epaulets from the jackets shoulders will be another milestone down the road.) What he conceals behind his placid facade is a gift for misadventure--at one point hes held hostage by a wily little boy at another hes held for questioning by incredulous cops--and a charming inclination to savor strangeness wherever he finds it. (John Christian Rosenlund did the beautiful rather formal cinematography and John Erik Kaada wrote and performed the evocative score.) If youre inclined to find fault with ""OHorten"" as I was not you may resist some of the signs of death and decay that Mr. Hamer plunks in Odds path; the most obvious are twin encounters at a tobacco shop. For the most part though the film comes at its subject from all sorts of peculiar angles and with intriguing apparitions--a kitchen awash in ice cubes the fleeting smile of a female ski jumper an elderly gentleman clinging to a briefcase as he slides down a frozen street. The strangest encounter involves a shaggy-dog story (and only incidentally a dog) but also a new friend who has renounced his identity. Odd Horten isnt up for such folly. He finally comes to embrace who he is as well he should. His greatest gift is for living. DVD Focus ENLARGE La Jetee Pauline Kael called this 28-minute short by the French poet novelist and filmmaker Chris Marker ""very possibly the greatest science-fiction movie yet made."" Surely its one of the most influential time-travel movies ever made; several generations of filmmakers have appropriated its substance though less often the singular tone of its tale about a Parisian astronaut who in the aftermath of the Apocalypse goes back in time to be with his lover. Criterions fine DVD couples ""La Jetee"" with Mr. Markers ""Sans Soleil"" a companion piece that is almost four times as long but no less beautiful or mysterious. ENLARGE The Thomas Crown Affair This remake stars Pierce Brosnan as a billionaire who stages an absurdly elaborate caper to relieve a Manhattan museum of a priceless Monet. Rene Russo is the picture of high maintenance as Catherine the insurance investigator who knows he did it and wants to nab him. She needs the thrill of the chase just as much as he does; then their cat-and-cat game gets complicated by love. The movie is pleasant enough but youd do well to check out the 1968 original with an electrifying performance by Steve McQueen as a Boston millionaire who steals 2 million in an intricately planned bank heist. ENLARGE Kitchen Stories Bent Hamers sly Norwegian-language comedy grows on you slowly surreptitiously. Its a deadpan story about sociological research that opens up if not out into absurdities worthy of Buster Keaton or Samuel Beckett. The story starts with a research scientist being sent to study the kitchen routines of single men. Then the film itself becomes a (pseudo) scientific study tightly focused on a single farmer named Isak and his earnest observer Folke who sits on a tall chair in Isaks kitchen like a displaced tennis referee. Some comedies make you laugh out loud. This one makes you smile inwardly but often. Find television listings at LocateTV.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> No laughs. No swinging-dick R rating (PG-13 really?). No road map for Terminator newbies to follow yet another time-travel plot. But even with a rusty script T4 still manages to blend action and feeling. Director McG filling the big shoes of James Cameron on the first two films (Jonathan Mostow had less luck on T3) turns Los Angeles circa 2018 into a post-Judgment Day wasteland right up Cormac McCarthys road. Better yet McG gets some wow effects without computer trickery just human faces in torment. McG pulls out all the stops. Maybe too many. Recycled lines (""Ill be back"") and a virtual Ah-nuld dont really help. But the actors do. As resistance leader John Connor Christian Bale rants as only he can against machines that would drain the world of its soul (hey thats Hollywoods job). Bale even cedes the juiciest part to Aussie newcomer Sam Worthington who is star material as a machine with a conscience. T4 is a mixed bag but its not fucking amateur.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 22 2009 Save for later Saved Actor Christian Bale in a scene from ""Terminator Salvation"" released by Warner Bros Pictures. Richard Foreman/Warner Bros Pictures/Reuters          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Terminator Salvation"" gives new meaning to the phrase heavy metal. The Terminators in this fourth film in the franchise are so big and clangy that during the fight scenes you may find yourself clutching your ears far more often than the armrests.Its 2018 and Judgment Day ""Terminator""-style has obliterated most of the planets humankind. But the Resistance - i.e. a few measly mortals - are still holding out for humanity. Topping the hero hit list is John Connor (Christian Bale) who is so intense his stare could melt plutonium. As we keep being told John is the ""prophetic leader"" of the Resistance.The current John is the grown-up version of the hero-in-waiting played as a whippersnapper by Edward Furlong (in ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"") and Nick Stahl (in ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines""). Through a time-travel scenario that only the Terminator geekocracy seems to fully understand Johns future father Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin who plays Chekov in the new ""Star Trek"") appears in ""Terminator Salvation"" as a teenager. Johns mission - one of them anyway - is to rescue Kyle from the clutches of the big bots. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? He has many other missions but this one is the biggest because if Kyle doesnt survive John Connor will never exist. Except he does. Whatever. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Terminator Salvation Even though John is the ostensible hero of ""Terminator Salvation"" the centerpiece stalwart is Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington who will be starring in James Camerons upcoming ""Avatar""). Marcus as we see from the opening scene was a murderer or something equally atrocious on death row who decided to donate his body to science. The really really bad intelligence network Skynet which is responsible for the nuclear annihilation 14 years before that turned the skies a perpetual shade of blah has coopted Marcuss corporeality and turned him into a state-of-the-art cyborg with - heres the catch - a human heart. Who thought the Tin Man from ""The Wizard of Oz"" would one day come back to us like this?That heart is what apparently makes Marcus human even though hes not. Hes certainly human enough for Blair Williams the Resistance warrior played by an actress with the altogether appropriate name Moon Bloodgood. Blair warms to Marcus when he helps her rout a band of scurvy marauders (human variety). Even when his electronic innards are exposed she refuses to back away from him. When asked by John why she comes to Marcuss aid even though he is suspected of being the enemy she replies ""I saw a man not a machine."" Who says love is blind?Marcus endures what passes for an existential quest in ""Terminator Salvation."" ""I need to find out who did this to me"" he intones and it is at this point that the Tin Man metaphorically morphs into an amalgam of Oedipus Odysseus and The Dark Knight (played elsewhere of course by Christian Bale - franchise movies are nothing if not incestuous). In these technopop extravaganzas its always the inhuman or half-human who ends up being the most human - e.g. Mr. Spock. Marcus is more intriguing to observe than John precisely because hes a (sort of) cyborg.McG a music video maven whose previous credits include the ""Charlies Angels"" movies directs the action passably well. (I suppose we should be thankful this film wasnt presented in 3-D or else wed all be ducking for cover for two hours.) I wish however he had inserted a bit of humor into the maelstrom. A couple of scenes directly reference the Iraq war and the Holocaust (where the humans are herded into cattle cars) and this is taking things much too seriously. This is a big blow-em-up franchise movie. It should not under any circumstances be confused with a Statement. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and language.)

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 20 2009 1048 PM Robot Parade Terminator Salvation is loud and dull. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Terminator Salvation click the arrow button on the player You can also click hereto download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Speaking as someone who enjoys being bludgeoned into submission by summer movies I cant complain about Terminator Salvation (Warner Bros.) on the grounds that its too loud too long and too full of airborne fireballs and 50-foot-tall cyborgs. My complaint is that the fourth installment in the Terminator series should have administered a more skillful drubbing to the senses. McG a former music video maker is an able director of action--when he films a fistfight or a battle sequence you can at least make out whos winning--but he lacks a sense of rhythm. A good summer movie isnt just an uninterrupted crescendo of cacophony. You need stuff in between the fireballs and the cyborgs. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The movie opens in 2003 as Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) a murderer on death row donates his body to science at the bequest of a terminally ill researcher (Helena Bonham Carter). Flash forward to 2018 when Marcus wakes up naked in a postapocalyptic landscape unsure of his existential status Is he alive or dead? Human or machine? (Worthingtons fluctuating accent suggests another question Australian or American?) Wandering through the ruins in pilfered clothes Marcus meets up with a teenage Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and learns what anyone familiar with the Terminator series already knows An evil robot empire called Skynet has taken control of the planet and seeks to eliminate all human life. Those humans who remain are organizing a resistance movement led by John Connor (Christian Bale). From cassette tapes left behind by his late mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton unfortunately present only in audio) John learns that he must find Kyle Reese and send him back in time so that Kyle can save Sarahs life and impregnate her thus allowing John Connor to exist and save the world. (Oh Lord just watch this timeline of compiled clips from the earlier movies.) Advertisement Mastering this tricky time-travel chronology is completely unnecessary in order to follow the movie. All you need to know is that giant robots want to kill us all. And McG has them trying to do so in myriad cool ways Some reach into moving vehicles to pluck characters out and lift them screaming Fay Wray-style into the sky while others slither through murky rivers in the form of metallic snakes. The old-school steel skeletons that slug it out with John and Marcus at the movies end are the most staid of the bunch although a digitally reanimated Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a brief and bracing appearance. The originality of the robots design is the best thing about Terminator Salvation. If only the humans on-screen embraced as wide a range of behavior as the machines do wed be in business. At some unfortunate story meeting someone decided that the fleeing rebels should drag a mute child (Jadagrace Berry) in their wake--shes essentially a piece of bait for the robots and for the audiences sympathy. Bryce Dallas Howard playing Johns wife Kate stands around looking beatific pregnant and vapid and the terrifically named Moon Bloodgood plays a slinky pilot who falls for the anguished Marcus. Between this film and The Dark Knight Christian Bale seems to be making a habit of playing stolid do-gooders upstaged by their own archrivals. Sam Worthington is no Heath Ledger by any stretch but even the hint of internal conflict gives his character an edge over the steel-jawed command-barking John Connor. Bales signature intensity is starting to collapse on itself; his definitive performance may turn out to be the tantrum he pitched at this films director of photography Shane Hurlbut during shooting. Bales paranoia that Hurlbut was getting in his way was well-founded. The monochromatic dystopia the cinematographer created is ultimately far more interesting than anyone in it.

Its not something you can program. You cant put it into a chip."" Apparently you cant put it into a movie either at least not if youre McG.""Terminator Salvation"" directed by McG and written by John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris mines the mythology of James Camerons original 1984 ""The Terminator"" by indifferently hacking away at it with a virtual remote-controlled backhoe. This is the fourth picture in the ""Terminator"" franchise -- the previous one the 2003 ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" was among the last pictures made by Arnold Schwarzenegger before he traded literal muscle for political clout -- and to work it would have to be compelling enough to make people give a damn. But ""Terminator Salvation"" is so programmed so impersonal that it practically dares you to warm to its characters. Why should we care about iconic resistance leader John Connor (Christian Bale) or his teenage dad Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) if not even McG can be bothered to give a fig? Even the action sequences feel canned Characters run toward helicopters yelling or grunt as they engage in jerky hand-to-hand combat. They may as well have been lifted from a lazily programmed computer game.But then this is summer entertainment brainless fun -- so maybe were supposed to look the other way as Bale gives what may be the most drab performance of his career. His John Connor is the man who wasnt supposed to be born ""Terminator Salvation"" is set in 2018 34 years after the action of the first ""Terminator."" The totalitarian creeps at Skynet are well on their way to exterminating humans using killing machines or Terminators to do the dirty work. In ""Terminator Salvation"" those machines dont yet look very Schwarzenegger-like (although thanks to the magic of computer imagery Schwarzenegger does make an appearance sort of); in this movies vision Terminators are gangly unstoppable gunmetal-colored behemoths with all-seeing red eyes.But a small hardy band of flesh-and-blood foot soldiers are fighting back John Connor is the bravest and most charismatic of all -- he gives rousing FDR-style radio addresses to his scattered followers which include Yelchins young Kyle Reese and the silent but sensitive little moppet Star (played by young actress Jadagrace) who tags along with him. Kyle Reese will of course become John Connors father -- or already is except he doesnt know it yet because its not yet 2029 the year hell go back in time to save John Connors mother Sarah. But lets not get ahead of ourselves. In ""Terminator Salvation"" John Connor (more a legend than a man hes never called just ""John"" or ""Connor"") also has to tangle with a sullen mysterious figure named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who may or may not be on the side of the freedom fighters. You Might Also Like Meanwhile a resistance babe named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood) strides through the movie on extremely long legs Shes about the only thing in ""Terminator Salvation"" that suggests McG or cinematographer Shane Hurlbut (the target of Bales infamous F-bomb tirade a few months back) have any aesthetic sense at all. Otherwise ""Terminator Salvation"" is downright ugly to look at rendered in dour sepia and gray tones that scream ""bleak future"" in capital letters. (Compare that with Emmanuel Lubezkis work in ""Children of Men"" which is set in an equally bleak future and still has a vital shuddering beauty.)McG clearly thinks hes giving us a visual spectacle When things explode in ""Terminator Salvation"" as they inevitably do they explode big. But that doesnt give the movie any more fire power or any more weight. McG and his screenwriters have taken the poetic ideas of the original story and fed them through a noisy meat grinder. The actors respond by doing little more than posing and posturing. Bale is so busy playing a quality -- thats Mr. Bravery to you bub -- that he doesnt bother to do the work of playing a character. His performance is the equivalent of watching a forehead vein throb for two hours -- although that might actually be more captivating. Worthington works harder and throws off a few more sparks than Bale does. But the movie doesnt give him much latitude for expressiveness even though his character is supposedly suffering some emotional pain. Worthington may be attempting a deeply internalized performance but the movie around him is too coldly mechanized to allow him the breathing space he needs. In fact everything about ""Terminator Salvation"" feels calculated and diagrammed. McG is a serviceable-enough filmmaker when he knows hes making dumb eye candy a la ""Charlies Angels."" But here he thinks hes dramatizing a heady man-vs.-technology showdown and he doesnt seem to realize that the outcome doesnt matter. ""Terminator Salvation"" has no brains and no soul; its just a mass of stiff creaking metal joints. Clearly the machines have won.

The machine wins. This isnt exactly a spoiler. Instead its a statement of what has gone wrong with the ""Terminator"" franchise. What was powerfully human in James Cameron and co-writer Gale Anne Hurds original film and 1991s stellar sequel has in ""Terminator Salvation"" been overwhelmed by the Dream Factorys assembly-line machinery. Its been 25 years since Arnold Schwarzeneggers cyborg was sent from the future to crush a human rebellion not yet born. Literally. He arrived famously naked and gunning for Sarah Connor future mother of future resistance leader John Connor. Christian Bale is Connor in this fourth installment directed by McG. Humankinds recoil against the steely efficiency of unchecked self-aware technology has become a sizzle reel for special effects. The FX are top-shelf. But coming so near ""Transformers"" some of the biggest bot showdowns seem familiar and beside the point. That point muted though it may be is that humans are scrappy dogged grief-stricken. No matter what the machines were gonna win. As one character says of the difference between mankind and the machines ""we bury our dead."" Of which there are plenty. The film opens in 2003 when a researcher (Helena Bonham Carter) pays a visit to murderer Marcus Wright on death row. The rest of the action unfurls in a post-apocalyptic 2018. Having caught wind that humans will pull the plug global artificial-intelligence concern Skynet goes pre-emptive. The look is rightly haunting. Cityscapes are towering empty ruins. Cars rust on dusty roadways. Cinematographer Shane Hurlbut casts this world in the washed-out hues of an ashen post-nuclear demise. Pockets of survivors remain. They fight. They hunger for John Connors transmissions. In a saga that toys with prequel-sequel notions one of the rebels is Connors father a teenager in L.A. Anton Yelchin (currently serving on the USS Enterprise as Chekov) has nice zip as Kyle Reese. Intent on killing Connor Reese or both Skynet revamped its Terminator line melding a beating heart with alloyed parts. Australian Sam Worthington is Marcus the kinder gentler more lethal model. Writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris (who tag-teamed ""T3"") know the fertile turf they tread. All the right tensions are here Has Skynets tinkering burdened the killing machine with human feeling? Has Connor become too hardened by his hatred of machines and his impossible mission? Will humans ditch compassion in the heat of being embattled? They just dont gel. As a kick-butt rebel who befriends Marcus Moon Bloodgood is saddled with corny lines intended to make these questions pop. There are glimmers of character amid piles of rubble and action sequences. Jane Alexander (nominated for an Oscar for 1983s post-nuclear elegy ""Testament"") plays a tough survivor with maternal instincts intact. Jadagrace Berry debuts as a wild-haired girl sure to stir memories of Newt the child Ripley bonds with in James Camerons ""Aliens."" McG hasnt Camerons gift for mining sentiment (and humor) in the midst of action. Even a final-act cameo meant to arouse a winking response barely registered with the preview audience. Run-ins with generals notwithstanding theres little in Bales depiction of Connor to explain his status among the worlds survivors. One could argue Connors grim demeanor is precisely what a global disaster demands. But Bales turn has a bass-note feel that is anti-charismatic. That said the actors infamous on-set tantrum -- an emotional moment that was seen by scores on the internet during filming -- has taken on a fresh meaning. After all the very serious actor targeted the cinematographer whose work upstages performers. Was Bale raging against the cookie-cutter machine battling the tyranny of style over substance? If so what an act -- however futile -- of heroism. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com.

Comments click to enlarge Terminator Salvation 2009 In the Terminator saga the world has been taken over by intelligent machines bent on eradicating humans; with the 25-year-old Terminator franchise the machine culture has won and the actors are just replaceable parts. Christian Bale takes over for Nick Stahl (who took over for Edward Furlong) as John Connor the rebel leader mythologized as humanitys only hope (except for those other two dudes I guess). As directed by McG (Charlies Angels) this fourth installment begins with lots of hardware and firepower and lets up only long enough to put across a tired time-travel plot in which Connor must rescue a teen wholl journey back to 1984 and father him. The movies only unmitigated pleasure is a too-brief fight scene between Connor and a naked combatant made up to look precisely like Arnold Schwarzenegger the relentless cyborg of the first three installments.

Bryce Dallas Howard left and Christian Bale are shown in a scene from ""Terminator Salvation."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Terminator Salvation"" unfolds in a world of rubble and asphalt and steel and dirt and blood. Actually unfolds is too weak a verb. The film explodes coming at you like shrapnel. It is an unbroken series of action sequences that aim to make you duck and cower in your seat. Its a brutal portrait of a barbaric world where a human resistance movement and homicidal robots battle for survival. Compared with James Camerons thought-provoking action classics ""Terminator"" and ""T2"" this is a powerfully dumb movie. The earlier films told sprawling stories that interwove disparate threads to create a coherent whole. This one strains our credibility with its epic unlikelihoods and tries to camouflage them with nonstop paroxysms. But it is undeniably exciting on a visceral level and for many that will be enough. The film is set in 2018 in nuke-blighted California a lifeless moonscape full of two-lane highways and derelict buildings. Its an environment ideal for relentless pursuit and anxious hide-and-seek. And that is pretty much the daily grind for John Connor (Christian Bale) and his beleaguered band of brothers (plus a few nubile sisters). They carry out risky assaults against SKYNET the self-aware military computer network committed to eradicating humanity. The rebels score a few successes in these battles but at awful cost. The odds of a human defeating a Terminator are about the same as a frog overpowering a lawn mower. The population of survivors dwindles with every turbulent scene. The film proceeds with video-game logic. The humans have a chance to strike at the heart of SKYNET by jamming the communications link to its army of high-tech killers. But that goal can be interrupted at any moment by an onslaught of unmanned fighter jets motorcycles or even mechanical eels patrolling the rivers. There are color-by-number characters here. Connor is a stoic hero and mankinds link with the future He shares many dewey-eyed looks with his fulsomely pregnant wife (Bryce Dallas Howard). Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) is the foolhardy teenager who matures in battle. Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) fights alongside both a tough convict with a mysterious background and motives. They spout hackneyed action movie dialogue occasionally recycling trademark lines from earlier ""Terminator"" films. But in this kind of film action speaks louder and in ""Terminator Salvation"" it practically shouts itself hoarse. TERMINATOR SALVATION  1/2 out of 4 stars  Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and language. Director McG (""Charlies Angels"") doesnt seem fully comfortable with the hypermasculine humorless tone of the story. His showcase scenes betray the strain of creating them -- theres a sheen of flop sweat over the whole enterprise. In one memorable continuous shot we stay right beside Connor as he battles Terminators jumps into a helicopter lifts off loses control crashes upside down stumbles from the wreckage and fights some more. Its an impressive technical achievement but its such a showy piece of work that it pulls you out of the drama. The Terminator franchise was built on thrills imagination narrative emotion believability character development and watchability. ""Terminator Salvation"" has plenty of thrills.

EntertainmentMovies New ""Terminator"" Despite explosions its no blast Originally published May 20 2009 at 1200 am Updated May 20 2009 at 204 pm Bryce Dallas Howard left and Christian Bale star in ""Terminator Salvation."" ""Terminator Salvation"" the fourth and least entertaining installment in the ""Terminator"" franchise stars Christian Bale as John Connor the prophesied savior of the human race. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times More video game than movie ""Terminator Salvation"" is the fourth and easily the least-entertaining installment in one of Hollywoods most successful science-fiction franchises. Absent almost entirely are interesting characters mind-bending time-travel puzzles and a story that matters. All of these were present in the 1984 low-budget sleeper hit ""The Terminator"" and its costly 1991 sequel. They made a star of Arnold Schwarzenegger and steered their director James Cameron toward ""Titanic."" The new ""Terminator"" is essentially a collection of disconnected chase sequences machine-gun battles and state-of-the-art CGI explosions including most impressively a towering atomic cloud that seems to rise above and engulf the star Christian Bale. Just why the cloud is there is not immediately apparent but it certainly looks scary. Like almost everything in ""Terminator Salvation"" it doesnt require a lot of thought. The dialogue is so inane that its easy to see why an actor of Bales stature would say flip out and become a YouTube phenomenon. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

The machines greatest misstep appears to have been to declare a pre-emptive war on humans in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. The new movies director McG (aka Joseph McGinty Nicol) does absolutely nothing to expand on this idea. He is best-known for creating the terminally fluffy ""Charlies Angels"" movies. The screenwriters John D. Brancato and Michael Ferris wrote Halle Berrys infamous ""Catwoman"" as well as the third ""Terminator"" movie which was released six years ago. Even the short-lived television series ""Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" (2008-2009) had a better sense of the franchises possibilities than their latest contribution. Bale should be in his element playing John Connor the prophesied savior of the human race previously played by Edward Furlong (in ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"") and Nick Stahl (in ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines""). But he spends so much screen time performing stunts and dodging bullets that theres little room to create a character. Sam Worthington the appealing star of Camerons new movie ""Avatar"" has a more complex role. He plays the semi-robot semi-human Marcus Wright whose motives are intriguingly murky. But the part ends up going nowhere. Similarly afflicted are supporting players Anton Yelchin Helena Bonham Carter Jane Alexander and Bryce Dallas Howard. Too bad Schwarzenegger is otherwise occupied these days. His face makes a crowd-pleasing cameo appearance in ""Terminator Salvation"" and so does his most famous line ""Ill be back.""

Terminator Salvation. (PG-13) Warner Bros (107 min.). Directed by McG. With Christian Bale Sam Worthington. Opens today in New Jersey. TWO STARS. In the near future an artificial-intelligence network called Skynet will effectively control the planet sending out shiny ruthless Terminator machines to erase all traces of humanity. A prototype is apparently already hard at work on the ""Terminator"" movie franchise. When it first appeared in 1984 the original ""The Terminator"" was a thrilling piece of science-fiction handmade and heartfelt. It may have been about robotics but it had a very human core. But then that has always been creator James Camerons secret. As big as his movies get -- and ""Titanic"" was literally that -- they always have a strong female lead and a romantic center. Yet while Camerons own follow-up ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" was a worthy enough second chapter it was like most sequels unnecessary -- and its dazzling effects only called attention to themselves. The non-Cameron ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" was even less engaging -- a business plan not a movie. And now -- joining various video games comics and a TV series -- comes ""Terminator Salvation"" a movie as mechanical as its villains. That doesnt mean it isnt effective; machines often are. The action sequences are exciting and the eye-candy impressive. Its guaranteed to satisfy 13-year-old fanboys of all ages (as well as studio executives who saw their series nearly wrecked by the lackluster ""T3""). But the inventiveness and emotion of those first two films are still gone. And theres plenty of blame to go around. Christian Bale -- occasionally lapsing into his ""Dark Knight"" rasp -- merely goes through the he-man motions as John Connor resistance leader. Sam Worthington -- occasionally slipping into his native Aussie inflections -- is unexceptional as the mysterious Marcus. The actresses significantly arent even worth mentioning. (Although one gets an unintentional laugh when having survived a nuclear holocaust and attempted gang rape she snuggles up to a handsome stranger with a woeful ""I dont meet a lot of good guys these days."") Put most of the blame though on the filmmakers. First of course there are the screenwriters -- responsible not only for the aforementioned line but ""Terminator 3."" And then theres director McG whose visual imagination is as crudely foreshortened as his name. From the pro-forma credits -- a dull prowl around the block letters of the title -- its clear theres a lack of vision here. And it only becomes clearer as the movie progresses shot in a bleached palette and reliant on all the excessive effects of a Michael Bay movie. The problem is that while that sort of over-the-top spectacle works in a Bay picture this is supposed to be a ""Terminator"" film not a ""Transformers"" sequel. We dont want to see mega-robots the size of skyscrapers. We do need to experience a story with some human-scale emotion. The film finally manages that in its last act as it strips down the action to man-vs-machine (and launches itself into a brutal climax that owes a lot to the first film -- including a special guest star). That sequence works beautifully. But the plotting throughout is schematic the characters mere blueprints and the texture -- once full of edgy motivation and logical puzzles -- all shiny mechanics like the Terminators own glittering skeleton. Skynet may not have ensured its own future yet. But their robots have clearly made serious inroads in our movies. Rating note The film contains strong violence and language.

"Review Terminator Salvation - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Review Terminator SalvationDirector McGs energetic movie plays with elements from earlier in the franchise. But some of its soul has been lost.May 20 2009|Betsy Sharkey FILM CRITIC ""Terminator Salvation"" is a boys-and-their-toys-gone-wild eardrum-shattering metal-shredding vision of a post-Judgment Day world at war that up to now weve mostly glimpsed in Sarah Connors fever dreams. (For anyone asking ""Sarah who?"" well get back to that momentarily.)This fourth edition of the franchise that forever shaped Arnold Schwarzeneggers film and political career (""Ill be back"" and ""Hasta la vista baby"" worked surprisingly well for both) comes at us with what can only be called McG-force. The director whose reputation was first made in 2000 on the restyled bounce and jiggle of ""Charlies Angels"" has found in ""Salvation"" a world that will almost almost contain his unrestrained energy and rabid optimism which makes for a movie mash-up of everything that manic imagination and money will buy.Christian Bale stars as John Connor now grown and finally living out his destiny to save the world from the blunt force of the killing machines that began in 1984 with Schwarzeneggers well-sculpted sunglasses-loving time-traveling single-minded cyborg killer. The Terminators failed mission to eliminate Sarah Connor then just a lonely waitress with a no-count future spawned not just son John and a successful franchise but a mega-career for writer-director James Cameron.Cameron discovered a million-dollar sweet spot between the virtually unstoppable mechanical killers hed created and a very human story of survival. T-800 T-1000 or any other models that rolled off the assembly line were fearsome in their relentlessness but also funny and surprisingly adaptable because they ""thought"" in their lethal but mutable way.In McGs new world order the machines now rule with enforcers of every shape imaginable roaming the land -- they fly swim search chase harvest transport jail crush and on and on but theres not a strategic thinker or a standout personality among them. In the countless battle scenes a sort of metallic madness takes hold but the tension of the chess match between hunted and hunter has been lost (for this screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris who also wrote ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" must share in the blame).Though weve been waiting for John Connor it is Marcus Wright who turns out to be the warrior the film needs and the salvation it seeks. Played by a scene-stealing -- make that movie-stealing -- Sam Worthington Marcus carries within him the question and possibly the answer at the heart of the series What is it that truly separates man from machine? So it is fitting that the story of ""Salvation"" begins and ends with him.Draped in a worn military-style overcoat gun in hand Marcus moves through a barren American West circa 2018 wearing his conflicted humanity like Clint Eastwood in his Sergio Leone days. Worthington overtakes every scene that he is in and you cant help but hope that along with his power ranger of a girlfriend Blair (an excellent Moon Bloodgood) he will find his way onto the drawing boards now shaping ""Terminator 5.""We first encounter Marcus on death row a killer who is persuaded in his final moments to donate his body to research. The last face he sees is that of a scientist (Helena Bonham Carter). Decades later Marcus gets a second chance unlike any he imagined. The good news Hes strong reconstituted and somehow alive. The bad Hes awaking to a post-apocalyptic rubble heap overrun by a massive metal army with nothing but death lurking behind their red unblinking laser eyes. More important Marcus finally wants to begin the hard work of understanding who and what he is.The journey for Marcus John and the rest of ""Salvations"" cast comes with a suitcase full of past time-traveling anomalies (a few footnotes provided). Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) turns up as a teenager years from saving Sarah Connor and fathering John (see T-1). He is the one to first rescue Marcus from the machines. Meanwhile back at resistance headquarters John is plotting the end of Skynet (see T-1 2 3). By now hes married to Kate (see T-3) played by Bryce Dallas Howard and theyre expecting a child. (Anytime you feel confused the answer will either be ""time travel"" or ""its complicated."")When John learns that Kyle has been captured and is headed to Skynet central for containment and probably extermination he knows from what his mother has told him (see T-2) that his very existence (see T-4) hangs on Kyles fate. Much of the action from that point on is built around Johns attempts to save his future father though Kyle must never be told who John is or how things will unfold (see T-1 2 3 and 4).1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTerminator Salvation; Better Off Ted; Night at the...November 29 2009SpongeBob Squarepants and the Terminator are modern heroesJuly 12 2009McG the machine behind Terminator SalvationMay 17 2009Bale tackles TerminatorDecember 11 2008Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-terminator20-2009may20,0,3567865.story",200,terminatorsalvation20,terminatorsalvation,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Looks like all the trouble the Connor family got into fighting terminators over the years was for naught. In the first three films and the recently canceled TV series they battled robotic intruders--and an increasingly paradoxical timeline--to prevent a machine-dominated apocalyptic future but Terminator Salvation takes place after that apocalypse has already happened. Thats the trouble with successful franchises They keep on going long after the reason for going is gone. Unless that is watching humans battle terrifying machines is reason enough. And for much of Terminator Salvation it almost is. McG launched his directing career with the Charlies Angels movies mercilessly edited pop-art headaches that played like reverse-engineered Mad magazine parodies. But he shows up here ready to play by the series rules. The first two-thirds of the film features an array of impressive setpieces that bring the trademark Terminator action sensibility--quivering flesh and fragile machinery versus the pitiless approach of unfeeling circuits--into a dusty post-nuclear hellscape on loan from The Road Warrior. Its a grim world and stepping in as once-and-future savior of humanity John Connor Christian Bale gives it an appropriately grim hero. Hes joined by Sam Worthington a man whose origins remain a mystery even to himself. First seen being executed for murder in 2003 he resurfaces in the post-terminator world via means he cant explain. Guilt-ridden and confused he sets about atoning for his sins one bullet-ridden machine at a time. As long as McG keeps the action moving the film remains on solid ground matching and often surpassing the thoroughly adequate 2003 entry Terminator 3 Rise Of The Machines. Hes clearly immersed himself in the work of Terminator mastermind James Cameron and Camerons relentless approach to action--juiced up by some state-of-2009 digital effects--serves him well. Eventually however the needs of story set in and it becomes apparent how little the film with its shallow characters and bellowed dialogue has going for it beneath the clank of metal on metal. And it doesnt help that the thrills leak out as McGs feature-length Cameron homage devolves into apery. Maybe humanity isnt fated to fall victim to machines but Terminator films seem fated to end in steamy factories filed with molten lead and steel staircases. The way-too-familiar climax feels less like a comment on destiny than like watching a finely crafted but soulless product roll off an assembly line.

Posted May 22 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT As titles of apocalyptic blockbusters go Terminator Salvation has just the right touch of post-traumatic (and post-grammatical) doomsday cachet. It certainly sounds classier than T4 Attack of the Robots which would have been more accurate. Were in the year 2018 just after the fabled Armageddon known as Judgment Day when the Earths machines rising up as one launched their assault on humankind. Red-eyed gleaming-silver-skulled Terminators now roam the wasteland mowing down the last humans who try to scurry away from their programmed firepower. Even ? a disembodied limb from one of these nasty droids can do damage. Thats how the centralized brain of Skynet has built them to come at you like Energizer Bunnies of death. There are other mechanized aggressors -- ?one resembles a flying saucer crossed with an electric shaver one is like a five-story looming gigantoid version of RoboCop only with a gun in place of its head. Watching Terminator Salvation there is never any doubt that the machines are alive. Maybe thats because the whole movie is a bit of a machine. The director McG is the wizard of whirligig whoop-ass who made the Charlies Angels movies and here he dresses up what is basically a blowout-in-the-junkyard battle film as if it were a holy conflagration. The color is bleached to granulated newsreel white black and beige for that dead-serious Full Metal Jacket effect and a transport car of human prisoners is shot to evoke the image of a death-camp train. McG also devises grimly novel ways to shoot action like depicting a chopper crash in a single shot from the POV of John Connor (Christian Bale) as he pilots it to a topsy-turvy landing. As a hero Connor is really no more distinctive than the gnarly unshaven outcast ringleader of every retro-future fantasy from Escape From New York on. Yet Terminator Salvation is invested in treating him like a grunge messiah. Bale brings the role his usual stylish seething edge. He seems ready to blow at any moment making his infamous on-set tantrum look less like a case of star egomania than like a Method actors refusal to break character gone amok. Connor leading a fringe of rebel fighters is out to protect Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) a teenager who has no idea how important he is If he lives he will grow up to be Connors father (the Michael Biehn character from the first Terminator) and will therefore sire the resistance movement. But all the loop-the-loop boy-is-father-to-the-man-who-must-protect-the-boy-or-the-man-wont-exist stuff is more fun to make sense of when youre leaving the theater. On screen its just a dimly revolving puzzle. Time-tripping flimflammery aside a good Terminator movie needs a hook thats kick-ass basic. The 1984 classic had the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a one-man demolition derby -- an image that was also a Hollywood joke since it turned Arnolds lousiness as an actor into the core of his appeal. T2 Judgment Day had its rock-em-sock-em face-off and all that mercury-robot shape-shifting. Following the noise and faux fury of Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Terminator Salvation has more ingenuity but still a lot of noise. Its basically a zombie movie with machines instead of the walking dead and with Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright a vicious criminal made over into...something else. Confronted with Worthingtons square-jawed stolidity audiences may be forgiven for wondering if hes meant to be a young version of Schwarzeneggers Terminator. It turns out though that hes not so easy to read -- nor nearly as entertaining. Hes a machine were supposed to feel for but every time the film asks you to do so you may taste metal. B?

Yes 2018 Thats only nine years from now I may actually live that long. And for what? As the elliptically named director McG tells us in the movies  production notes ""Were telling the story of the becoming of John Connor the becoming of Kyle Reese the strengthening of Skynet and where our humanity lies. This is the moment when humanity takes a stand against the machines."" I have quoted this passage only to inform my readers that it makes very little sense to me even after seeing Terminator Salvation. The problem may be the result of my never having become addicted to the Terminator series James Cameron initiated in 1984 with The Terminator which he eventually followed seven years later with Terminator 2 Judgment Day. All I retained from these first two Terminator films was the serio-comic image of Arnold Schwarzenegger with machine-made muscles. I didnt pick up on all the intricate time-travel subplots in which characters from the future send terminators back into the present to make sure that they are born and that they are enabled to mature into the future. Hence all the palaver in McGs synopsis about this character ""becoming"" and that character ""becoming."" As it happens I never did get to see Jonathan Mostows Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines in 2003. By this time Mr. Cameron had become a master of the universe with the global success of Titanic (1997) and had presumably outgrown the Terminator series. The point is that co-screenwriters Mr. Brancato and Mr. Ferris who wrote the screenplay for Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines which posited the nuclear apocalypse that John Connor and his mother Sarah had spent their lives trying to prevent have now written the story and screenplay for Terminator Salvation. In so doing they have created a new character named Marcus Wright and played by Sam Worthington. We first meet Marcus on death row calmly facing execution for an unspecified crime being visited by a strange woman Helena Bonham Carters Dr. Serena Kogan who thanks him for donating his body for some valuable and again unspecified experiment. The execution takes place with a set of lethal needles but the next thing we know Marcus is seemingly reborn and embarked on a mission he doesnt understand. Meanwhile a decisive battle is looming between the forces of the human survivors led at first by General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) and the machines led by a nebulous organization known as Skynet. I say nebulous because the only identifiable acting entity speaking for Skynet is Ms. Bonham Carters Dr. Kogan. McG has dedicated the film to the recently deceased Stan Winston (1946-2008) who designed the original Terminator robot and all its subsequent variations. He won Best Visual Effects Oscars for James Camerons Aliens (1986) and Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991). Indeed Winstons machines are something to behold though not entirely to believe even in this age of robotic devices to clear mines and drop bombs on the Taliban without causing American military casualties. The imagined fear that these mechanisms will turn on us is part of the sci-fi fantasy world created with films like Terminator Salvation. I suppose it is a way of escaping our more strongly based fears of a total financial collapse and an endless series of wars against an infinite variety of insurgencies. The character of John Connor humanitys projected savior was played previously in his various stages of maturity by Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl. For the current version set 14 years after the nuclear apocalypse Christian Bale was cast and he is very effective in the role as is Mr. Worthington in the role of Marcus whom John Connor is not sure whether to trust as humanitys ally or to suspect as a spy from Skynet sent to infiltrate the human survivors base of operations. Of course the varied intrigues cannot be resolved one way or another in view of the needed justification for still another sequel of robotophobia a sequel that I promise myself I will try to avoid. Nonetheless I cannot completely condemn a movie that has been very competently written directed and acted any more than I can blame Mr. Schwarzenegger for all the woes he has encountered while trying to govern California. asarrisobserver.com Comment Filed under At the Movies Christian Bale Helena Bonham Carter movie Sam Worthington Terminator Salvation Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2009/05/its-back-to-the-future-terminator-salvations-time-warp-left-me-dizzy/,200,terminatorsalvation23,terminatorsalvation,com/2009/05/its-back-to-the-future-terminator-salvations-time-warp-left-me-dizzy/

BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 May 21 2009 (...) Terminator SalvationPG-13 - 155 - Contains strong language and intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence After a quarter century even the mightiest machines can grow sluggish. ""Terminator Salvation"" is so steeped in the cheese of the 80s that it never rises.And its not the kind of cheese that the fans can feast on. With catch-phrasing favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger relegated to a digital cameo all thats left over from the salad days of the franchise are the stale notion of killer robots and the empty calories of sensory overload.Those who havent studied the previous ""Terminator"" properties will be especially puzzled. The year is 2018 and for no good reason a computer system called Skynet has unleashed battlebots to destroy the human population reducing it to pockets of resistance that seem confined to the bombed-out areas of the American West. The resistance is commanded by the baritone bulging-veined Gen. Ashdown (Michael Ironside) but according to prophecy its true leader is a courageous underling named John Connor. Through four movies and a television series the Connor character has been through so many casting changes that hes difficult to hang onto. Now the blowtorch has passed to Christian Bale.As in ""The Dark Knight"" the stoic Bale is overshadowed by a co-star. Sam Worthington plays Marcus a convicted murderer who has been genetically re-engineered as a hybrid human/robot. Awakened by a nuclear blast and unsure of his identity Marcus hikes across California to near-empty Los Angeles where he meets a teen holdout named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and his mute girl sidekick Star (Jadagrace). Reese hopes to rendezvous with the resistance unaware that Connor is his own son who will send him back in time to ... oh never mind.The director who calls himself McG who showed promise with the cheeky ""Charlies Angels"" movies has reduced the movie to a kabuki version of an action flick. Anyone who remembers the musclebound movies of the Reagan era will roll their eyes at cliches like a downed pilot who turns out to be babe with flowing hair an evil genius who explains a double cross in a posthumous video or a feral child who takes a misunderstood robot by the hand.""Terminator Salvation"" is a tale told idiotically full of sound and fury signifying nothing.

"Terminator Salvation Hes back and its bad | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTerminator Salvation Hes back and its badRegardless of how well the film has turned out - and frankly the best that can be said is that it blows up real good - the release alone is cause for celebration coming only 24 hours after the official cancellation of the franchises TV spinoff.John Connor (played by Christian Bale) confronts a Terminator in Terminator Salvation.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Rob SalemTelevision CriticWed. May 20 2009 (out of 4)Starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. Directed by McG. 114 minutes. At major theatres. 14A When we last left the future freedom fighter John Connor ...But heres the thing The concept of ""last"" is rather fluid when it comes to time-travel. As it is in any discussion of the character John Connor featured now in three Terminator movies (albeit in the first as a fetus) and now as of midnight tonight four with the release of Terminator Salvation starring Christian ""Batman"" Bale as the near- futures adult robot-rending saviour. Regardless of how well the film has turned out - and frankly the best that can be said is that it blows up real good - the release alone is cause for celebration coming only 24 hours after the official cancellation of the franchises TV spinoff Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles which chronicled more than anything else a teenaged John Connor still struggling under the wing of his over-protective violence-prone mom.Article Continued BelowSalvations John Connor is (will be) all grown up now (then) and smack in the middle of the civilization-saving battle that several generations of murderous man- machines have been sent back into the past to prevent.Had they only been successful.Terminator Salvation is less a sequel Terminator film than it is a kind of Post-Apocalypse Now and an amalgam of about a half dozen genre films that preceded it primarily Mad Max Aliens TransformersThe Matrix and if you count Bale re-affecting his scary gravel voice the last two Batman movies.And it isnt that there is no story left to tell - indeed this new Terminator promised to add a final chapter to the ongoing saga coming full circle to see our hero win the ""War Against the Machines"" and send his own father back in time ...If this makes no sense to you - and unless youre a fan there is no reason why it should - chances are you wont be lining up for this one any time soon. Or ever if you want my advice. And I am a fan.How could such a great idea go so horribly horribly wrong?There was reason for optimism going in or at least some sense of continuity provided by writers who were actually involved with the last few sequels and the short-lived TV show.The problem is theyre not alone. If the legions of anonymous scribes who worked at various times on this script (among them master script doctor Paul Haggis) actually got screen credit the movie would have been about a half hour longer than its already too long 117 minutes. Not only do too many cooks spoil the broth you end up with more bad broth than anyone could possibly swallow.Worse still they spend the last five minutes setting up the inevitable next sequel - unless of course this thing tanks as badly as it should.Bale has no need to worry He still has his rebooted Batman. His teenaged future father Anton Yelchin is already integral to the seasons most successful franchise flick the similarly rebooted Star Trek. And Sam Worthington the actor saddled with the most objectionable character arc has wisely gone all the way back to source to shoot Avatar with Terminator creator James Cameron. Thus proving the often-invoked Terminator mantra ""No fate but what we make.""

Pictures Straight shooter Christian Bale continues the saga of John Connor the human Resistance leader in a post-apocalyptic world in franchises fourth installment. WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Whats left of the human race continues to rage against the machines in Terminator Salvation (  out of four). But without Arnold front and center the heavy-metal fracas is just not much fun. Christian Bale stars in this lackluster fourth installment in the Terminator series but his Batman-Terminator crossover doesnt work. Things do explode well and loudly. The machines are bigger shinier and meaner than ever and the world they inhabit is even more grim and bleak. But the dramatic elements flat-line; any kind of humanity is in short supply. INTERVIEW A very private Christian Bale opens up about movies TIMELINE A guide to the Terminator saga CALENDAR See what other movies are coming this summer Bale is surprisingly one-dimensional as John Connor the leader of the human Resistance movement whose destiny is linked to the future of mankind in this doomsday action franchise. He seems to be simply recycling his gravelly Dark Knight growl. Newcomers to the series Sam Worthington and Anton Yelchin come off better than Bale in this post-apocalyptic adventure. Worthington plays Marcus Wright whose last memory was his impending execution in 2003. He appears in the war-torn landscape of 2018 unaware how he got there. Just before dying he agreed to donate his body to science urged on by Dr. Kogen (Helena Bonham Carter). Her research gets usurped by the evil artificial-intelligence conglomerate Skynet. As the Resistance leader Connor must decide whether to trust Marcus. Meanwhile Skynet has captured Kyle Reese (Yelchin) a Resistance fighter key to the entire saga and Reeses young cohort Star (Jadagrace Berry). Yelchin (Star Treks Chekhov) seems to be the go-to guy for summer blockbusters. He has some of the best lines such as his directive after encountering Marcus ""Come with me if you want to live."" Worthington has a quiet intensity marred only by yelling ""Nooooo"" three times in about 10 minutes. Director McG (both Charlies Angels movies) is all about visuals and creating an ominous sense of disorientation but hes not as deft with storytelling or eliciting performances. Few characters ever say more than a couple of sentences at a time and when they do its often to assert the obvious. The predictable story feels as if it were written by a computer program labeled ""sequel."" (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and language. Running time 1 hour 55 minutes. Opens Wednesday night in some markets nationwide on Thursday.)

It touches on philosophy (What makes us human?) technology (Does an automated system leave itself vulnerable to creativity?) and even politics. It features a cameo by a sitting US governor whose character is as adept with weaponry as Sarah Palin as unbreakable as Jon Corzine and as unpopular as David Paterson. PHOTOS 19 Coolest Movie Robots The direction this movie chooses is killer robots. ""Terminator"" the fourth which is either a solid B-movie or a disappointing A-movie is worth seeing for the lusty blare of its pumped-up shootouts and for the mucky clanking post-apocalypse whipped up by director McG (""Charlies Angels""). At times the action makes ""The Road Warrior"" look like a poetry seminar. ""Terminator Salvation"" comes as close as any movie to reproducing the feeling of being a crusty-faced boy making trucks crash in a sodden back yard. Some of these boy endeavors were thin on story and character. No one much cared. Its 2018 after Judgment Day -- when Skynets machines went first berserk and then nuclear. The resistance fighter John Connor (Christian Bale) has learned from tapes left behind by his mother Sarah that he must locate the teen Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) so he can send him back to 1984 (and the first movie) to protect Sarah and become Johns father. Connor is also trying to hack the terminators software and shut them down via what the movie calls (excuse me for using the technical term) ""an off switch."" I couldnt help thinking of the psychotic Krusty the Clown doll on ""The Simpsons"" that could be fixed by toggling from evil to good. Meanwhile Reese a teen who leads a band of resistance fighters has joined forces with Marcus Wright a condemned killer who in the opening scene is shown donating his body to science before his execution. This bravo is played by an obscure Aussie named Sam Worthington who has signed on to play the lead in so many features including James Camerons ""Avatar"" that film critics are programming function keys to type his name at a stroke. He gets as much screen time as Bale a proven screen dynamo. Does he deserve it? Not really. The story has a couple of weaknesses it covers up with much roaring of metal. Connor has a magic box problem (everywhere he goes he uses his handheld override gizmo to short-circuit the machines which means the box is really the hero). The terminators have a storm trooper problem. Why are these super-sophisticated killing machines built with such obvious flaws? Those ""Star Wars"" storm troopers were so easily felled that their armor penetrable by toothpick-size arrows fired by teddy bears could not have been constructed of any substance stronger than Chinet. As for these terminators why do they proceed in slow determined marches unarmed while being blasted with machine guns? They throw somebody against the wall. The humans reply by upending vats of molten metal on them. ""Terminator Salvation"" is largely an anti-""Star Trek"" whose culturally diverse warriors are dirty-faced desperate and screamy eating three-day-old dead coyote because its better than two-day-old dead coyote. Retro skills like fixing a broken radio or hot-wiring a car become as important as the warp drive is on the Enterprise. Muscle matters; negotiation is futile. The special effects are used to suggest not futuristic wonders but industrial rot. Its like putting a space shuttle engine inside a Dodge Charger. Like ""Star Trek"" though the movie finally discards rationality and the ""cold calculating decisions by the machines"" suggesting that heart is what matters. Yet what makes this movie is the digital effects. Its got all the heart of a demolition derby. kyle.smithnypost.com TERMINATOR SALVATION Rockem sockem robots. Running time 107 minutes.

Liam Lacey Globe and Mail update Published Wednesday May 20 2009 1211PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Terminator Salvation Directed by McG Written by John Brancato and Michael Ferris Starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington The first thought in walking out of Terminator Salvation  the fourth movie in the series begun with James Cameron in 1984 is that it would be interesting to see the colourized version. Using a palette that emphasizes shades of grey and black except for the occasional orange burst of flame or gunfire the movie has all the visual delight of an army blanket under a fluorescent bulb. In compensation for the colour deprivation Salvation is so loud it suggests a two-hour-long heavy-metal drum solo as various kinds of robots airplanes cars motorcycles and artillery clang rattle and smash across the screen. You can imagine the different conversations that went on with different parts of the crew with the set designers asking ""Shall we add a little more grey to that rubble?"" while the sound editors wonder ""Can we make the flare hiss like a cobra?"" Though competent in its B-movie way Terminator Salvation lacks the humour heart-tugging moments and visual pleasure that made the first two movies of the series modern pop masterpieces. Director McG (aka Joseph McGinty Nichol) who previously made the Charlies Angels films and the feeble football movie We Are Marshall  seems determined to put his fluffy movie past behind him. This is his big war movie depicting the long-awaited showdown between the humans and the machines. That means the audience is in for a relentless sequence of disorienting action sequences and massive conflagrations and terse do-or-die conversations spit out between the characters. As a mood-setter the movie starts with a prologue scene with a man in prison Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who is visited by a waxen-looking bald doctor (Helena Bonham Carter) who is dying of cancer. Thats well before the artificial-intelligence computer system Skynet has unleashed nuclear weapons to destroy most of humanity. The current movie properly starts 14 years after that apocalyptic event when Marcus the executed prisoner unexpectedly wakes up and finds himself alive again. Or possibly in Hell. Against the dusky skies and desert landscape various kinds of black metallic robots and cyborgs (primitive skeletal versions of the specimen played by Arnold Schwarzenegger in the previous movies) are scouring the earth picking off the last remnants of the human race. Some of them are being put in transport ships to be subjected to experiments at their headquarters. Is there any relief from so much horror? Well for the theatre audience at least some of the robots are kind of cool-looking. Especially the spidery one called a Harvester which is about as tall as a hydro tower and plucks people up with its many tentacles. For the humanity in the film the only solace is a prophesized new leader of the anti-machine Resistance a man with the same initials as Jesus Christ. Hes John Connor (played by Christian Bale in a role handled previously by Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl). In the current movie Connors mission isnt just to save the human race in general but to rescue a particular teenager Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin who plays Chekov in the new Star Trek film). If Kyle gets to grow up hell travel back in time to save Sarah Connor from the original Terminator (Schwarzenegger). Then Kyle can impregnate Sarah so she can gave birth to John who will grow up to save Kyle Reese and it will go around again. As Sarah says in a cassette tape message from the past to her son ""It can drive you crazy."" What McGs not so good at is forging a compelling or even coherent story from his combustible action sequences or getting good performances from his actors. Bale employing his Dark Knight growl without even a Bruce Wayne change of pace is a one-dimensional. Australian actor. Worthington who plays Marcus is more blunt and brawny than Bale but not different enough to provide a lively contrast. The two men growling and shoving their stubbly chins at each other does not add up to dramatic tension. Powerful maternal women were part of the Eighties sci-fi ethos that director James Cameron created with Linda Hamilton in Terminator and Sigourney Weaver in Aliens . Here weve reverted back to hair-flipping and cleavage with Moon Bloodgood as a downed pilot who has to be rescued by Marcus from being raped by some random yahoos. Bryce Dallas Howards role is so weakly defined it was an hour and a half into the film before I realized she was supposed to be John Connors wife not his pregnant second-in-command. Her characters main purpose seems to be to set-up Christian Bale to say a familiar line from an earlier film. The trouble is every reference to one of the previous Terminator films including an archival cameo is a reminder of when the Terminator movies were a less visually and emotionally single-minded and a hell of a lot more fun.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Both warning and advertisement the Terminator films are technophobic teases selling tickets by promising this decades model of killing machine the classic V8 1984 Schwarzenegger; the bullet-streamlined liquid-metal 91 Robert Patrick of T2 Judgment Day; Kristanna Lokens 2003 T-X (with burgundy pleather upholstery).Terminator Salvation a departure in many ways is the first Terminator with no upgrade. The hardware is clanky and runs on diesel. Schwarzenegger is present only as a CGI mask. The franchises creation myth--the toppling of humanity by Skynet computers--has finally come to pass. Its 2018--time enough apparently for survivors to start dressing like drum circle squatters. Christian Bales John Connor is a maverick officer in the human Resistance. Sam Worthingtons Marcus Wright last he remembers donated his body to Cyberdyne before a lethal injection. He wakes to a blasted world carrying a plot twist familiar to anyone who knows their Philip K. Dick.To hear director McG tell it this is nothing less than Terminator Salvage a mission to ""re-establish credibility"" (a/k/a consumer confidence). The obvious models are Chris Nolans po-faced Batmans. McG who started off directing videos for frosted-tip bro bands is stripping down getting ""dark."" Hes stricken color from the screen and book-clubbed his cast with copies of The Road. The visuals cite a checklist of 20th-century catastrophes Worthington in a Soviet-issue greatcoat walks a Dresdened L.A.; oilfield fires a la Kuwait darken the horizon; human tissue is harvested in Holocaustic cattle-car roundups. Theres even one of those simple nudges at contemporary commentary--""We are not machines and if we behave like them then whats the point in winning?""--that industrial-filmmaking liberals honestly believe alchemize entertainment into Art like lead into gold.Change was inevitable--the established Terminator formula has been squeezed dry in FOXs prime-time The Sarah Connor Chronicles. But among the many things junked in McGs chop-shop is the notion of pleasure The director describes cutting that ""gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture"" (God forbid) to get a franchise-first PG-13. He does however begin his film with the hook of Worthington clammily kissing a vampire-complexioned bald-pated Helena Bonham Carter. T3 director Jonathan Mostow trained on submarine and trucking thrillers knew he was covering a greasy headbanger classic not writing scripture. I went to his movie effed up and had a hoot; anyone planning the same for T4 will drop before the credits.Salvation rolls along with Marcus on the road his journey toward Resistance radio transmissions honoring the series paranoid momentum (The Terminator actually had more in common with the unstoppable slasher pic than sci-fi mythos). The action set pieces cut with overdone hectic percussion are engaging enough. Its when Marcus and Connor intersect--trekking to strike at Skynets Silicon Valley nerve center which looks to be somewhere between Mordor and the Port of Houston--that the movie slackens with McG tugging at emotional connections he never stuck in place. Theres a bit with Worthington smashing a monitor that I realized--with embarrassment as it went into slow-motion--was actually supposed to be cathartic.The Terminators have always respected female durability from commando-mom Linda Hamilton to T3s intimation of masculine obsolescence with effeminized Arnold modeling a pair of Elton John sunglasses. Salvation is comparatively anti-girl. Moon Bloodgoods pilot is introduced shaking a luxuriant mane loose from her flight helmet making a Jennifer Beals-in-Flashdance shocka out of something the preceding movies took for granted. Shell later face an arbitrarily staged menace; her would-be rapists are the only yee-hawing rednecks in the movie though any American Resistance would realistically be half Scotch-Irish gun nuts. Bryce Dallas Howard as Connors wife is here just to set up the all-time most convoluted ""Ill be back.""But the essential problem here isnt the ladies--or the lack thereof. Its the no-frissons Bale-Worthington pairing. Bale doing the ""Grrr"" voice is a lesson in how clenched effort does not equal effect. Whats remarkable about his leaked freakout--mostly embarrassing in revealing a director who cant Alpha up on his set--is that its over a performance in McGs ""Terminator Salvation."" Did the dude sweat this much over Reign of Fire? Worthington half-burying his Aussie accent under gruff bluff is of the blunt Jason Statham-Daniel Craig genus with a bit of Ricky Hatton thrown in (with Hattons level of resourcefulness). These Commonwealthers are dull trudgers all--can we get a tariff?Judgment Day alloyed pathos and explosions by matching Arnolds impassivity with Eddie Furlongs silent film-dolorous reaction shots--for those of a certain age its impossible to remember the sentimental gambit of that final thumbs-up without getting misty. Salvation terminally gray all macho bark doesnt do contrasts. This means monotony--as predictable as when the movie tanks McG telling an interviewer it was ""too dark"" for the multiplex.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Terminator Salvation Action. Starring Christian Bale and Sam Worthington. Directed by McG. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) McG is a director with an above-average eye and an original instinct for camera placement. To his credit hes not one of those lazy types who think they can generate excitement in an action sequence by shaking the camera or kicking it. But he has a major weakness as a filmmaker and that weakness is all over ""Terminator Salvation"" His grand elaborate visual sense is completely detached from his brain. So what we end up with is a filmmaker who gets it right in all the small ways meticulously crafting bits of action - showing what it might be like for example to be inside a crashing helicopter. But in all the big ways hes so lost that the movie becomes comical. He piles action blowout on top of blowout. When in doubt he increases the scale. Explosions get larger fireballs bigger. The machines become increasingly resilient as the soundtrack goes right up to your ears and keeps pounding. Yet nothing he does can distract us from the fact that he barely has a story to tell. The only question is was he covering for the absence of story or did he actually not notice the lack of one? Photo Warner Bros.

Movie review Terminator Salvation Resist 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Whoever thought in 2003 that wed look back on ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" as the good old days? Yet the previous ""Terminator"" film thought to be the absolute nadir had two things going for it. It had Arnold (if you think a ""Terminator"" movie can be bad with Arnold try one without him). And it had a villain. There is no villain in ""Terminator Salvation"" no locus of wickedness just some nebulous evil entity known as Skynet a company that builds killer robots and has already depopulated most of the earth through a nuclear holocaust. But is Skynet satisfied? No it wants to keep trying to kill John Connor who is now in his 30s and the leader of the human anti-Skynet resistance. When Christian Bale allowed himself to play Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins"" he was slumming - and to good effect. But with ""Terminator Salvation"" this ostensibly serious actor takes up residence in the action ghetto and its not a good fit. As John Connor he goes through the film gritting his teeth and talking in a growling whisper as though he still had the Bat ears on. Bale will get away with it this time for the simple reason that no one is going to be looking at this as a performance - its more like posing as things blow up. But soon this actor will have to decide if he wants to be more like Sean Penn or Nicolas Cage. Much is made in ""Terminator Salvation"" of the strength and sophistication of the new killing machines. One is about the size of a five-story building and has a machine gun for a head. Most are human-size and look like animated metal skeletons. However at one point in the film Skynet comes up with a new creation that has human skin and can speak and the company calls it the ultimate infiltration machine. But wait. All three previous ""Terminator"" villains looked human and were capable of speech. They could infiltrate human society too. So how is this new model an advance? And if Skynet really wanted to infiltrate the human population why would it keep manufacturing those monstrous-looking steel-skeleton robots? Question the story of ""Terminator Salvation"" in even a cursory way and the edifice crumbles. Sam Worthington as a mysterious ex-con who becomes a key player in the resistance is the one element to salvage from the mess. Largely unknown until well this morning this Australian actor has the appealing masculine authority thats becoming his countrys trademark. He also carries himself well in a couple of emotional scenes despite awkward dialogue and one grimly dramatic unintentionally hysterical moment that will have audiences howling. Still why complain about botched dramatic scenes in a movie thats all about the action? So lets end with a word about the action itself It isnt really action. Its commotion. It cant be action if nothing happens and nothing can happen because the commotion doesnt advance the story. The commotion the explosions the fireballs function here only to delay action to keep the status quo in place so as to stretch what otherwise would be a 20-minute short into an almost two-hour feature. ""Terminator Salvation"" looks busy but its static. The thing doesnt budge. Its an epic waste of time. -- Advisory Scenes of peril and robot cruelty. More reviews in the Movie section Friday.

"Terminator Salvation | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; terminator-salvation ) Terminator Salvation (United States 2009) May 19 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note This review contains ""casting-related spoilers."" Terminator Salvation does not seem like a Terminator movie at least when compared to what we have experienced from filmmakers James Cameron (The Terminator Terminator 2 Judgment Day) and Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines). This fourth Terminator is a different breed with a divergent feel almost as if director McG (nA(c)e Joseph McGinty Nichol) had decided to fuse Cormac McCarthys The Road with Transformers. Gone (at least mostly) are the time travel paradoxes and the concept of a single indestructible villain. In their place is a futuristic war movie. With its idea of an insurgency striking against an implacable evil empire theres more than a little Star Wars in Terminator Savlation although not even at its Empire Strikes Back bleakest was Lucas series this dark. For the first occasion in four movies Terminator Salvation does not move back and forth in time. Excepting a prologue in 2003 it stays rooted in 2018. This is a period not explored in previous installments of the cinematic series. Of course after all of the muddying of the past that transpired in the second and third Terminator films its no longer clear how much of the ""established"" future remains valid. As in Star Trek were dealing with an alternate universe so all bets are off. Will John Connor really become the legendary leader of a human resistance that overcomes the machines (as indicated in The Terminator)? Will he be killed by a T-800 that is subsequently re-programmed by his wife (as established in T3)? One of the problems with introducing time travel is that standard rules no longer apply. Filmmakers can do anything they want. The screenplay for Terminator Salvation went through a significant number of re-writes. It is credited to John Brancato amp; Michael Ferris but was polished by the likes of Jonathan Nolan (who buffed it after Christian Bale came on board) and Paul Haggis. The result shows the effects of many fingerprints (too many subplots with too few payoffs) but it is more ambitious than the storyline for T3 which followed the basic ""Cameron formula"" established in the first two entries. Unfortunately despite several rousing action sequences (involving cars trucks motorcycles giant Transformers-like robots and flying hunter-killers) the first two-thirds of Terminator Salvation are rambling and disjointed. The final 30 minutes (or so) compensate for the deficiencies of what comes before. The climax is great - non-stop kick-ass action and a surprise or two. In 2018 John Connor (Christian Bale) is not yet the worldwide head of the human resistance. He is however one of many local leaders and the voice of the resistance on the radio. His superiors led by the uncompromising General Ashdown (Michael Ironside) believe they have created a weapon that can shut down the machines if its brought to bear at a close enough range. Connor volunteers to test it. While doing this he has a secondary objective locate a younger version of his father Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) who has been targeted by the machines for termination. Reese is skulking around the ruins of Los Angeles when he joins forces with a mysterious stranger named Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) who is headed for San Francisco the heart of the machine empire. Reeses partnership with Marcus doesnt last long - the machines capture the teenager leaving Marcus with the job of finding John Connor to mount a rescue operation. The weakness of the film results from the lack of a central villain. Random T-600 Terminators pop up from time-to-time only to be dispatched rather quickly (although not necessarily easily - they are tough to destroy). There is conflict between Connor and Marcus but neither is a bad guy; in fact their goals align. Action movies need strong antagonists. The engine that drove the three previous Terminator movies was the threat represented by the time-traveling killers. With that missing Terminator Salvation has trouble locking onto a target. When does it snap into focus? When the T-800 makes its first dramatic appearance. Suddenly theres a recognizable villain and a clear goal. All is right with the world. McG knowing his audience and being a fan tosses out Easter Eggs. Composer Danny Elfman employs Brad Fiedels signature score at several key points. The first words uttered by Kyle Reese are ""Come with me if you want to live."" Later Connor deadpans ""Ill be back."" Linda Hamilton provides vocal work for when her son listens to the taped journals she recorded for him back in the 1980s. And Arnold Schwarzenegger is back after a fashion in the role that catapulted him to the action megastar stratosphere. When his character who exists here as the result of digital mapping and effective editing stepped onto the screen the audience erupted. Theres no doubt this is the high point of Terminator Salvation. It argues that if Schwarzenegger wants to return to the franchise after he leaves political office the fans will welcome him back. In fact one could argue that the actors absence is a hole McG cant plug. The action sequences are pulse-pounding the special effects are top-notch and the post-apocalyptic atmosphere is palpable but were kept waiting until the end for the real Terminator to show up. Bale is suitably intense as Connor. This is a solid portrait of obsession and Bale dominates the screen. Hes more of a force here than in his Batman movies but thats to be expected since theres no cowl and cape involved. Sam Worthington a relatively new face to North American audiences is an effective foil for Bale although his American accent could use a little work. Perhaps the biggest surprise is Anton Yelchin. Although I wasnt impressed by Yelchins version of Chekov in Star Trek he nails Kyle Reese. Its as if someone de-aged Michael Biehn 35 years and put him to work. Bryce Dallas Howard takes over for Claire Danes as Connors love interest although she has little more to do than stand in the background holding her pregnant belly. Moon Bloodgood as one of Connors underlings has the ""action female"" role although shes no Linda Hamilton when it comes to physicality. By radically destaturating color sometimes to the point where scenes are almost black-and-white McG develops a strong post-apocalyptic aesthetic. Its a lot like the (recent) TV series Battlestar Galactica where everything was dark and grimy and bright colors rarely made appearances. One could argue that McG overdoes it a little but hes clearly not averse to traveling down potentially unappealing roads. The faux note of hope injected at the films end does little to dispel the fact that if the humans win the war the price is going to be astronomical. Perhaps the ultimate problem with making more Terminator movies is that the entire story was told by Cameron in the first two movies and the subsequent sequels including this one have been struggling to explore corners where the time travel contrivance allows for flexibility and interpretation. Terminator Salvation like its immediate predecessor is enjoyable and contains some top-notch action sequences but it seems extraneous. This is everything a good summer movie should be and while it does not dishonor the Cameron chapters of the saga neither does it prove to be an indispensable adjunct to them.

Written by Michael Ferris amp; John Brancato Paul Haggis Jonathan Nolan Shaun Ryan and Anthony Zuiker. Directed by McG. Warner Bros. Pictures. May 21 (Richard Foreman / Warner Bros. Pictures) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Terminator Salvation is one of the most visually impressive films in the series. The action is non-stop and the look borders on dazzling.Fittingly for a movie about machines director McG (Charlies Angels) and writers John Brancato and Michael Ferris have cobbled this together from bits of earlier models -- effects and action beats from recent Dark Knight movies settings from earlier Terminators. But ironically for a series thats supposed to be about an embattled humanity struggling against those who lack it there isnt an emotional moment in this. A murderer (Sam Worthington) is executed in 2003 but not before a cancer-stricken researcher ( Helena Bonham Carter) talks him into donating his body to science. Darned if 15 years later killer Marcus doesnt wake up after a rebel raid on a Skynet facility to find himself in the middle of the war between ever-upgrading machines and the humans who once controlled them. Christian Bale is the messianic voice of the resistance broadcasting by shortwave rallying commandos for strikes against the strongholds of the robots. The cities are a wasteland but Connor has hope. His mom ( Linda Hamilton on cassette tapes) prepped him for the future the one that visited her in the past and impregnated her. Connor needs to find and protect Kyle Reese played by Anton Yelchin as the well-armed teen who will grow up to be his father ( Michael Biehn in 1984s The Terminator). Memorable lines are recycled ""Come with me if you want to live."" ""Ill be back.""But as fierce as the firefights are as stoically heroic as Bale is in this lead role (nobody lights a flare with as much flair as Christian Bale) the movie lacks a villain we can focus on or a character we really root for. That makes this a Transformers movie without the wit a Terminator without the pathos.Its far from awful but Salvation is close to joyless something easily predicted when this redundant film was first announced. After three earlier films and a TV series youd think that a new installment in the People vs. Skynet saga would be unnecessary. Sadly for McG and his fellow recyclers thats the one prophecy here that proves to be true.

Terminator Salvation Director McG. Cast Christian Bale Sam Worthington Anton Yelchin. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Spotlight Christian Bale Action stars with accents Terminator tech Sci-fi favorites Franchises will be back Is Terminator director McGs name worth a chuckle? McG finds Salvation in Terminator sequel Does another Terminator overstep the limits? Sam Worthington Terminator feels like Oz All action noise and grit even the presence of a Terminator with not a heart of gold but even better the heart of a human cannot provide it with much warmth. Director McG proves perfectly adept at blowing things up in interesting ways but theres not so much acting here as there is yelling at different volumes. Then again youd have to yell when everything is exploding around you. Fine as far as it goes in small loud doses but stretched out over the course of a film it begins to wear thin. The exception to this is Sam Worthington whos quite good as Marcus Wright. He provides the most humanity in the movie and hes clearly the best thing in it. The film opens in 2003 with Wright a convicted killer an hour away from being executed by lethal injection. For the price of a kiss he agrees to donate his organs to Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) herself dying of cancer. Next thing we know its 2018 and Judgment Day has taken place thanks to the self-aware artificial intelligence Skynet killing most of the people in the world (Los Angeles population two). Skynets Terminators continue to hunt down whatever pockets of survivors are left. There is a resistance and one of its leaders is John Connor (Christian Bale) the prophesied savior of the human race as hes called here and as fans of the franchise already know. Among the resistances other members Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) half of the LA population and the eventual father of Connor once Connor sends him back to save and impregnate his mother. Remember this was radical stuff in 1984 when Arnold Schwarzenegger was menacing Linda Hamilton and we first started wrapping our head around all of it. Now the films have to figure out ways to remain consistent with the mythology yet create something new. Reese is kidnapped by the machines and taken to Skynet. Theres a plan in place by ruthless resistance leader Gen. Ashdown (a barking Michael Ironside) to destroy a Skynet base but Connor knows this will kill Reese and result in his never being born. Wright meanwhile shows up in 2018 naked and wandering the scorched earth of a recent battle trying to figure out what it is hes wandered into - and when. (Arriving on the scene naked is one of many nods to the original film). Soon enough he is trying to convince Connor to trust him to help infiltrate Skynet and save Reese - a trust that Connor has good reason to be wary of. Its a bleak world McG portrays with none of the welcome humor of the other installments. When Schwarzenegger said in his distinctive accent ""Ill be back"" in the original it was sort of funny sort of scary and so catchy it became iconic. Theres an explicit nod to that here but it falls flat and is quickly forgotten. (McG should study J.J. Abrams in this regard; his tips of the cap to the mythology in ""Star Trek"" are pitch perfect.) Bale is intense and single-minded of purpose - and evidently of mood. Does he ever so much as smile in the film? Yelchin does a nice job with Reese a plucky kid who doesnt know how important he is only that its important to stay alive. But its Worthington whos best as doggedly determined as the rest but somehow more alive. He has his reasons for wanting to get at Skynet reasons that have to do with his own identity. ""Terminator Salvation"" could have used more of that kind of thing. Subtlety is something it lacks. Instead it marches forward so relentlessly it would make any Terminator proud if not every moviegoer satisfied. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(Warner Bros.) Joe Neumaier Tuesday May 19 2009 1124 AM Title Terminator Salvation He said hell be back - but who knew the best of 80s action flicks would come with him?""He"" is Arnold Schwarzenegger whose CGI-created face turns up on a new body in a crucial battle in ""Terminator Salvation"" a fast-moving rock em-sock em movie that continues the man-vs.-machines series begun 25 years ago. Between this and ""Star Trek"" popcorn-movie reboots have hit high gear. The last entry 2003s ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" was the Governators final starring role and it ended with reluctant messiah John Connor and his girlfriend Kate in a fallout shelter as the sentient computer Skynet launched nuclear attacks. Fifteen years after ""T3"" was set Connor (Christian Bale) commands a network of resistance fighters battling robots that rule a post-apocalyptic world and corral people to make cyborg parts. Connor has another goal To ensure his own birth by saving teenage renegade Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin also in ""Trek"") whos fated to go back in time save Connors mother and then father the future leader as seen in James Camerons 1984 original. Meanwhile theres another chase to get Reese involving a prototype Terminator Marcus (Sam Worthington). Early on we see Marcus on Death Row signing away his body for postmortem experimentation. His story - a narrative graft from ""Frankenstein"" - has him seeking the scientist (Helena Bonham Carter) whose research blended his heart mind and skin with an android skeleton. The indestructible Marcus believes hes a man and his evolutionary journey is more interesting than Connors which requires him to be inhumane to save humanity. Part of the strength of the storyline is due to Worthingtons subtle empathetic performance. Bales rumbling ""Dark Knight"" voice is great for shouting which works for the barking militarism and may have scared crew members but doesnt allow for the pop heroism of 1991s ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day."" (When Connor says ""Ill be back"" its surprising as it seems hes forgotten the good-guy Arnie of ""T2."") Yelchin for his part apparently got the right DVD rentals to prepare for his ""Red Dawn""-like cub commando. Which clicks since at its heart ""Salvation"" is a return to Reagan-era sci-fi. Director McG even keeps the gripping ""Road Warrior""-lite action scenes linear and kind of retro avoiding todays nervous chop-shop editing style. When you add the mushroom clouds and Bale Yelchin and even Schwarzeneggers brief turn it all fits to a T. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Terminator Salvation (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Terminator Salvation (PG-13)  Save us from this dour bum-out new Terminator. Bryce Dallas Howard as Kate Connor and Christian Bale as John Connor. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald Every summer movie season must have its share of clanging heavy metal and fitting the bill this year is the awkwardly titled Terminator Salvation which has enough exploding robots aircraft and artillery to tide us over until Transformers 2 arrives. Neither bland enough to ignore nor noteworthy enough to remember the movie occupies that crowded middle ground of serviceable sequels that send you home feeling if not exactly burned then certainly unsatisfied. This is the most dour and humorless of the four Terminator pictures -- I dont think theres a single moment of comic relief in the whole two hours -- and the serious tone weighs down the film. Sure those Terminator motorcycles are way cool and the Godzilla-sized Terminator is even cooler. (The noises it makes are pure movie-geek heaven -- the neatest movie sound effect since the bombs that went ke-raaang during the asteroid-belt sequence in Attack of the Clones.) But director McG (aka Joseph McGinty Nichol) in a bid to be taken seriously as an action filmmaker after those two Charlies Angels baubles practically admonishes you for having any fun. The tone of Terminator Salvation is bleak bleak bleak The movie is a bum-out disguised as a popcorn muncher. When McG sneaks in the occasional visual homage to The Great Escape or a couple of crowd-pleasing odes to previous Terminators they almost feel like accidents. Wipe that smile off your face This is a war movie dammit The intensity is just superficial though In terms of story Terminator Salvation is also the most timid in the series. Theres no invention in it no sense of discovery. Only the impressively orchestrated action sequences feel fresh. Screenwriters John Brancato and Michael Ferris who previously collaborated on the vastly superior Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines finally get the chance to depict the war between man and machine that has been the lynchpin of the franchise. But that war turns out to be cookie-cutter Post-Apocalyptic Warfare 101 stuff (think The Matrix sequels). An hour into Terminator Salvation theres a neat twist you wont see coming that briefly enlivens the scenario but the script takes it in the least interesting of all possible directions and the story flatlines. The plot thickens then it curdles. Cinematographer Shane Hurlbuts sepia palette which renders everything in the hues of desert sand and gray skies is initially striking. But after a while the color scheme grows visually dull. You start craving more color than Terminator Salvation is equipped to provide. The same goes for the performances. As the long-beleaguered John Connor (previously played by Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl) Christian Bale exudes gruff intensity and stoicism and creates a black hole of charisma on the screen. Rarely has a big-budget spectacle been graced with a hero this blank. But Bale isnt really the films star anyway. Terminator Salvation belongs to Australian actor Sam Worthington who gets more screen time -- and more stuff to do -- as Marcus Wright a Death Row inmate from our era who awakens in 2018 and must protect the teenaged Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) who will grow up to be Michael Biehn and travel back in time to sire John Connor who will eventually save mankind from the machines. Got that? No worries Youll have plenty of opportunities during Terminator Salvation to tune out contemplate the vagaries of time travel and wonder if you should have stayed home and done the laundry. The answer is a qualified No. Those motorbikes really are cool. Cast Christian Bale Sam Worthington Anton Yelchin Moon Bloodgood Jadagrace Helena Bonham Carter. Director McG.

John Connor is a rising force in the resistance against Skynet the artificial intelligence network that started thinking for itself and eradicating humanity. He has seen destruction and listened to the recordings left by his mother that foretell his future but he has yet to send anyone back in time in hopes of stopping it including the man who will become his father.(You definitely need to have seen the first three movies to have a clue as to whats going on here. This is no time to play catch-up. Being a fan also helps.)McG director of the ""Charlies Angels"" movies and ""We Are Marshall"" drops into this well-established lore and presents a post-apocalyptic world that is repetitively bleak and relentlessly loud. Yes the machines have taken over so of course theres going to be a healthy amount of clanging crunching metal and automatic weapon fire -- but even things that shouldnt be noisy like the lighting of a flare sound like a rocket launch.And Christian Bale steps into the role of John Connor played previously by Edward Furlong and Nick Stahl and he ... well he does the same voice he uses when he dons the black suit for the ""Batman"" movies a monotone guttural growl regardless of the dialogue. Connors function as Christ figure is clearer than ever in the script from John Brancato and Michael Ferris who also wrote 2003s ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines""; nearly everyone who managed to stay alive describes this ""JC"" as a messiah and a prophet but not everyone believes it. The metaphor adds yet another layer of portentousness -- but the writers also threw in a couple of classic ""Terminator"" lines ostensibly to lighten the suffocating mood. Instead theyre real groaners.John must find and protect his future father teenager Kyle Reese (the plucky Anton Yelchin) while also trying to determine whether to trust the mysterious stranger Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to help him with this quest. Worthington has the masculine good looks and formidable screen presence to stand strong opposite Bale -- but naturally he also has to scream a lot. This installation sorely needs more of the kind of liveliness Arnold Schwarzenegger brought to the franchise.""Terminator Salvation"" does feature some inventive camerawork though -- McG is a commercial and music video veteran after all -- and the intricate special effects weve come to expect from the series (the work of the late Stan Winston who died before the film was finished). Several of the new villainous devices are extremely cool including the Hydrobots four-foot-long killer eels that attack under water.But theres not much here in the way of way of humanity even with the strong feminine presence of actresses including Bryce Dallas Howard Moon Bloodgood and Jane Alexander. It seems the machines have already won.""Terminator Salvation"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and language.

Too bad the dramatic elements just as robotic. The latest chapter in the successful cyborg series following 2003s ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" -- and the first sans Schwarzenegger -- ""Terminator Salvation"" doesnt skimp on all that crunching heavy metal. But while incoming director McG (the ""Charlies Angels"" movies) certainly gets a rise out of the machinery in the post-apocalyptic thriller theres little sign of life where the flatly executed human component is concerned. The terminally sullen results are unlikely to hurt the pictures opening holiday weekend given the presence of last summers boxoffice king Christian Bale but its total domestic take will fall a lot closer in line with ""Terminator 3s"" 150.3 million than those gargantuan ""Dark Knight"" numbers reaped by Warner Bros. Columbia is handling the film in most international territories. Taking place in 2018 or 14 years after the dreaded Judgment Day has occurred ""Salvation"" finds armies of Skynet Terminators patrolling the bombed-out remains of the country searching for the odd pockets of human survivors who managed to survive the blasts. Among the living of course is John Connor (Bale) who despite his uncertainties seems well on his way to becoming the official leader of the Resistance. Hes far less certain about the intentions of Marcus Wright (Australian Sam Worthington) a former death-row inmate-turned-organ donor who appears willing to help him track down a teenager named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) who of course is supposed to grow up to become Johns father. Nevertheless the two form an uneasy alliance. Although director McG manages to keep the machinery humming 18 years after James Camerons ""Judgment Day"" and its liquid metal raised the F/X stakes considerably anchoring it in any sort of satisfying dramatic context is another story. And the one provided by ""Rise of the Machine"" scripters John Brancato amp; Michael Ferris (curiously theres no mention of original character creators Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd) fails to give Bale and Worthington much opportunity to stand out from all the monochromatic rubble. In Arnolds absence an important ingredient of the ""Terminator"" iconography -- namely the fun factor -- is in short supply. Apparently sensing the deficiency the filmmakers have found a couple of ways to pay homage both in terms of line callbacks and through the magic of special effects. But at the end of the day despite the still-potent landscape provided by cinematographer Shane Hurlbut production designer Martin Laing and visual effects supervisor Charles Gibson -- the film is dedicated to the late Stan Winston who designed the first T-800 -- and that rumbling propulsive Danny Elfman score an inescapable truth remains Its just not the same without the Governator. Terminator Salvation -- Film Review By Michael Rechtshaffen May 17 2009 0600 ET Bottom Line The machines rise to the occasion. Too bad the dramatic elements just as robotic. The latest chapter in the successful cyborg series following 2003s ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" -- and the first sans Schwarzenegger -- ""Terminator Salvation"" doesnt skimp on all that crunching heavy metal.But while incoming director McG (the ""Charlies Angels"" movies) certainly gets a rise out of the machinery in the post-apocalyptic thriller theres little sign of life where the flatly executed human component is concerned.The terminally sullen results are unlikely to hurt the pictures opening holiday weekend given the presence of last summers boxoffice king Christian Bale but its total domestic take will fall a lot closer in line with ""Terminator 3s"" 150.3 million than those gargantuan ""Dark Knight"" numbers reaped by Warner Bros.Columbia is handling the film in most international territories.Taking place in 2018 or 14 years after the dreaded Judgment Day has occurred ""Salvation"" finds armies of Skynet Terminators patrolling the bombed-out remains of the country searching for the odd pockets of human survivors who managed to survive the blasts.Among the living of course is John Connor (Bale) who despite his uncertainties seems well on his way to becoming the official leader of the Resistance.Hes far less certain about the intentions of Marcus Wright (Australian Sam Worthington) a former death-row inmate-turned-organ donor who appears willing to help him track down a teenager named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) who of course is supposed to grow up to become Johns father.Nevertheless the two form an uneasy alliance.Although director McG manages to keep the machinery humming 18 years after James Camerons ""Judgment Day"" and its liquid metal raised the F/X stakes considerably anchoring it in any sort of satisfying dramatic context is another story.And the one provided by ""Rise of the Machine"" scripters John Brancato amp; Michael Ferris (curiously theres no mention of original character creators Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd) fails to give Bale and Worthington much opportunity to stand out from all the monochromatic rubble. In Arnolds absence an important ingredient of the ""Terminator"" iconography -- namely the fun factor -- is in short supply. Apparently sensing the deficiency the filmmakers have found a couple of ways to pay homage both in terms of line callbacks and through the magic of special effects.But at the end of the day despite the still-potent landscape provided by cinematographer Shane Hurlbut production designer Martin Laing and visual effects supervisor Charles Gibson -- the film is dedicated to the late Stan Winston who designed the first T-800 -- and that rumbling propulsive Danny Elfman score an inescapable truth remains Its just not the same without the Governator.

Wheres Arnie when you need him? By David Edelstein Published May 17 2009 ShareThis (Photo Richard Foreman/Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) In Terminator Salvation machines have exterminated most of humankind and run the planet; I think they made the movie too. This isnt storytelling its programminginorganic matter passing for life. James Camerons 1984 original and its showy sequel were also mechanical but their killer bots had charm Arnold Schwarzeneggers metallic readings and lumpy-jawed bodybuilder arrogance meshed riotously well with the part of a cyborg assassin and Robert Patricks T-1000 was a witty preternatural blankwith adorably incongruous teacup-handle ears. The fourth time out the bad machines are steel-skeleton FX the humans less compelling. Its not wholly the fault of the director McG who decently storyboards the clashes and explosions. As I said its the machinesor more precisely the Hollywood Machine that sifts through books and old movies in search of the holy franchise and at strategic intervals generates nonessential sequels. The Terminator began with a villain and a hero traveling back in time and the fourth installment isnt so much an advance of the story as a footnote This is how we got to where weve already beenfor 25 years. John Connor (Christian Bale) prophet of the resistance must defeat the machines and send Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) to 1984 to save his mom and deliver a payload of sperm that will grow up to be John Connor. Of course every time trip has its perilsjust ask the Vulcans in the new Star Trek. Maybe in this time loop the machines will kill John before he can kill them. Maybe Kyle will stand too close to an X-ray machine and become infertile. As Sarah Connor exclaims to her son (via cassette tape) God a person can go crazy thinking about thisa line that must have given everyone on set a good laugh. Onscreen alas nothing lightens the mood. With McGs migraine-inducing jerky-cam and monochromatic palette (livened only by splotches of rust) Terminator Salvation puts the numb in numskull. Minus a fun new terminator the movie offers a second protagonist Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) whos executed by lethal injection in a nineties prologue after signing away his body to whey-faced scientist Helena Bonham Carterand then mysteriously bounds naked from some wreckage in a post-nuclear-holocaust 2018 looking remarkably buff. No spoilers here I wont deprive you of the pleasure of figuring out his secret for yourself about an hour and a half before the Big Reveal. Worthington an Aussie has a brief but vivid role as a studly hooligan in Greg Mcleans delectable killer-croc picture Rogue and he manages to suggest a soul in torment with a minimum of inflection. Its not that hes all that winningits that the competition never gets out of the gate. Millions have viewed via YouTube Bales abusive tantrum on the set of this film and hes virtually the same on-camera Chewing out an insensitive cinematographer or snarling at a fellow fighter hes equally unpleasant. Bale is a Method guy who tries to become his roles and in principle thats fine. Im in the minority in liking his Batman His humorlessness resonates with Bruce Wayne. But as the hero of an outlandish sci-fi thriller he lacks imagination and dash. Johns mission is the apogee of nuttiness to find his dad a teenager and keep him alive to impregnate mom and save the world from an army of titanium-girded Austrian musclemen. But Bale is such a dour prig you wonder why he just doesnt abort himself in spite. Steven Soderberghs failures are in a different class than other American directors. My guess is that he doesnt like to know going into a shoot what hes going to come out with which is one reason he acts as his own cinematographer and often his own camera operator He wants to participate in the process to live with his actors in the moment. I imagine him in the editing room playing with the overall structure rearranging scenes and roughening the syntax approaching his raw footage like a Cubist jigsaw puzzle Lets try the nose under the mouth shorten the leg allow content to dictate form. Yet theres something oddly inflexible about him. Soderbergh gets a big idea and sticks with it even when its not working. Maybe he doesnt know its not working. More likely he doesnt want to know. Hes a paradox a control freak who overcompensates by being loosethen cant let anything interfere with that looseness. Hes rigidly freewheeling. Soderbergh has set himself multiple challenges in The Girlfriend Experience all of them formidableif not suicidal. The first is to build a film around a nonactress the hardcore-porn star Sasha Grey an almond-eyed beauty with a disarming self-containment. She plays Chelsea a high-end Manhattan call girl and Soderbergh intends to scrutinize that protective layer. He engages assorted nonactors and gives them room to come at Sasha from varying angles. A nameless journalist played by New Yorks own Mark Jacobson interviews her and the scene is cut into multiple parts and inserted at key junctures. Jacobsonwarm shaggy manipulative as hellasks questions to ease Chelsea into letting down her guard arduous work for scant returns. The voluble blogger-critic Glenn Kenny plays a blogger-criticof call girls In the movies most vivid scene Kenny is degenerate appetite incarnate negotiating with Chelsea the price of a good review while paving the way for a career as the Sydney Greenstreet of underground cinema. The central more scripted relationship is between Chelsea and her live-in boyfriend Chris (Chris Santos) a personal trainer who accepts what she does but is blindsided when a client stirs something deep in her. At least she says its deep. We have to take her word for it As an actress Grey doesnt put out. As an actor Santos seems like a great personal trainer. The Girlfriend Experience captures a moment in our history The 2008 election hasnt happened but the economy is in a dive a government bailout is coming and theres little in the way of a real president. Its a desperate limboeveryone is selling few are buying. But most of the dialogue is listless and no matter how much Soderbergh snips and stitches the movie is a corpse with twitching limbs. Its rare to watch actors who appear to be improvising (badly) and yet manage so often to step on one anothers lines. The suspense is minuscule Will Chelsea find love with a client she barely knows or be dashed against the rocks? (Three guesses.) Behind the camera Soderbergh hyperventilates. In some scenes the leads in the foreground are blurred while the extras behind them are in focus. Its as if his unconscious is sending a message. Terminator Salvation Directed by McG.

Darker grimmer and more stylistically single-minded than its two relatively giddy predecessors ""Terminator Salvation"" boasts the kind of singular vision that distinguished the James Cameron original the full-throttle kinetics of ""Speed"" and an old-fashioned regard for human (and humanoid) heroics. Only pics relentlessly doomsday tone -- accessorized by helmer McGs grimy gun-metal palette -- might keep auds from flocking like lemmings to the apocalypse. The fourth in the celebrated sci-fi series ""Salvation"" opens and closes with humanity at war with the machines. In other words this thing isnt going to end soon. Nor should it if it keeps on like this. McG whose segue from music vids to movies resulted in two ""Charlies Angels"" extravaganzas and the woeful ""We Are Marshall"" exhibits an unexpected flair for the dreadful abrupt and awesome. What we get here -- which was perhaps missing on the relatively sunny mental landscapes of ""Terminator 2 Judgment Day"" and ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" -- is a sense of real horror When humans are snatched up like Cheez-Doodles by skyscraper-sized Go-bots theres no slo-mo relief or stalling. Stuff happens as it might were the world actually overtaken by demonic appliances. Christian Bale playing the ""prophesized leader of the Resistance"" John Connor may have traded in the Batman body armor for ""Road Warrior""-style outerwear but one thing hasnt changed He is once again a movie star playing second fiddle. Heath Ledger stole ""The Dark Knight"" away from him and Sam Worthington (who will appear in Camerons ""Avatar"" this Christmas) heists ""Terminator Salvation"" from Bale for the most ironical of reasons In a movie that poses man against machine Worthingtons cyborg is the far more human character. As a steel-beaded logo of Warner Bros. fades away Marcus (Worthington) on death row for an unexplained crime gets an 11th-hour visit from Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) who wears the headscarf and pallor of a terminal cancer patient. She wants Marcus body -- literally. She wants to turn him into a cyborg. Wracked with guilt resigned to his execution Marcus agrees to sign the release in exchange for a kiss. ""So thats what death tastes like"" he says as she leaves him to his lethal injection. This is not your governators ""Terminator."" Bale meanwhile playing the adult version of the hero-to-be portrayed by Edward Furlong (""Terminator 2) and Nick Stahl (""Terminator 3"") is as purposeful and furious as anyone played by Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. One suspects hes been studying Linda Hamilton in ""Terminator 2"" although -- lets face it -- this is serious business. Its 2018. Skynet -- the ""aware"" machine -- has all but accomplished its self-appointed mission of destroying the threat of people. But pockets of rebellion continue to operate even if as in the case of a charred and rubble-strewn Los Angeles the local contingent consists of just two kids Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and the mute/cute Star (Jadagrace). Kyle -- given a slightly geeky and perfectly plausible portrayal by Yelchin (""Star Trek"") -- will grow up to father John Connor after being sent into the past to meet Sarah Connor (if you havent followed the ""Terminator"" time line this is no time to be catching up). Thus he has to be preserved. So does John given that its been predicted since 1984 that hell be the one to save the world. Theres a lot at stake. McGs direction is always intelligent. (He does seem to have a thing for ""The Great Escape"" which is referenced several times.) The script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris occasionally goes off the rails. Certainly their insertion of an existential dilemma for Marcus -- ""I need to find out who did this to me"" he says his chrome-plated plumbing having been exposed to the open air -- feels very late-inning. And the obligatory borrowing from the previous movies (""Come with me if you want to live"" ""Ill be back ..."") tend to upset the mood created within McGs bleached-out world which is very deliberate and doesnt need the comic relief. There are great bits though The thrashing centipede-like killer-snake thingie which has the personality of a wolverine is a neat invention. So are the biker Terminators which molt like malignant pinecones off their towering mother bot. A Schwarzenegger lookalike -- it isnt clear whether its the ex-actor CGId or a complete fabrication -- is funny but in this case apt. Production values are enormous especially d.p.
