The girls yack and yack and yack some more in ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" a gabfest in which an estranged Southern mother and daughter sling the hash egged on by an eccentric circle of friends. Based on the bestselling work of Rebecca Wells Callie Khouris busy directorial debut belongs to a particular strain of down-home over-the-top femme fiction that includes the likes of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" and ""Steel Magnolias"" and will therefore test the tolerance levels of many viewers particularly men. But more than a few women will eat it up and this Warner Bros. release makes enough emotional connections however brazenly to clock in as a nice middle-range summer B.O. performer upon June 7 release. A few years ago Shelley Winters would have killed for Ellyn Burstyns role as Vivi a booze-sipping overbearing self-dramatizing grand dame whos made life into Louisiana hell for her entire family but remains the most powerful personality on the horizon. Even a presence as large as Winters would have fit easily into the scheme of things here as the dramatic style is one of broad gestures knowing looks blustery wisecracks and life-defining pronouncements such as ""When I said For Better or For Worse I knew it was a coin toss."" But there must be a reason that the sort of comic caricatures of Southern womanhood as displayed here have weathered the test of time so there may be kernels of truth buried behind all the studied glances poses and play-acting. And if such material is tossed off with sufficient flair and brio as it intermittently is by the largely talented cast its possible to become momentarily distracted by the high melodrama of Vivis life and her decided mixed influence on everyone in her orbit. Time-jumping scenario is set in motion when successful New York playwright Sidda (Sandra Bullock) delivers a few hard knocks at her moms mothering skills in a magazine interview little suspecting that Vivi will retaliate by launching World War III. Enter Vivis ""henchmen"" the now-elderly members of the eponymous secret society which ringleader Vivi founded some 60 years prior Widow Necie (Shirley Knight) constant tippler Caro (Maggie Smith) and sleek Teensy (Fionnula Flanagan) the wealthiest of the bunch. Imposing trio who for all their bickering act as one stage a self-styled ""intervention"" by kidnapping Sidda and taking her back to Louisiana with the idea of effecting a reconciliation between daughter and mother. The point of all that follows is for Sidda to learn everything she doesnt know about her mother which is considerable; process also might push Sidda past the psychological/emotional barriers that have prevented her from marrying Connor (Angus MacFadyen) her b.f. of seven years and counting. As the old biddies regale Sidda with stories and allow her to partake of their ""divine secrets"" via a carefully maintained scrapbook action rewinds to their own youth which was spent on the upper crust of Southern society and even involved a trip to the Atlanta premiere of ""Gone With the Wind."" Young Vivi (Ashley Judd) was the center of the whirlwind back then a vivacious beauty whose life only began to go wrong when her beau Jack Teensys brother was killed in World War II. In consolation she married eager second-best Shep had one kid after another and finally sank into an abusive oblivion of booze-drenched disappointment with her life a progression tolerated by her endlessly admiring husband but scarcely comprehended by her offspring. The revelations come in carefully apportioned morsels and are at first so encumbered by a combination of aged flutterings and youthful high spirits that a quick O.D. seems imminent. Once the time-skipping settles into a rhythm however pic begins establishing some momentum and cinematic grace thanks especially to John Baileys lustrous widescreen cinematography and the distinctive musical contributions of T Bone Burnett and David Mansfield which serve to partially offset the pics gaudy trappings and the leading characters petulant stubbornness. Mother and daughter are kept physically apart until the inevitable climactic reconciliation by their mutual refusal to give an inch this despite the combined massive efforts of the three Ya-Yas Connor and Shep a milquetoast whom even James Garner cannot supply with any backbone. Screenwriter Khouri clearly has worked overtime to try to make the modern story and flashbacks reinforce one another as she pinpoints key ups and downs of Vivi and Siddas lifelong relationship with fluctuations in the latters feelings about her ability to commit to Connor. Khouris direction however is less focused sometimes to the point of offering a stylistic correlative to the disarray of the characters lives. While there are pleasures to be had from watching so many grand actresses strut their stuff the fact is that the overriding preoccupation here rests with surface impressions rather than psychological probity. Burstyn and Bullock dont really match up as mother and daughter physically or temperamentally; the former has no problem with Vivis narcissistic histrionics but the latters understated style makes her the outsider of the piece both as character and actress. As a rich gum-chewing matron who tools around in her canary-yellow Rolls-Royce Flanagan is the pictures real scene-stealer while Smith seems uncustomarily ill at ease and Knight has little to do. Entirely convincing as the young belle of the South Judd seems less at home trying to convey the inner demons eating Vivi alive.

Posted June 21 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Three histrionic Louisiana dames (Fionnula Flanagan Shirley Knight and Maggie Smith) broker a reconciliation between a hysteria-prone fourth (Ellen Burstyn) and her equally excitable daughter (Sandra Bullock) in this estrogenically fortified drama based on Rebecca Wells 1996 best-seller of the same name.

"Ya-Ya Sisterhood A Yakety-Yak Attack washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Ya-Ya Sisterhood A Yakety-Yak Attack Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 7 2002 I FEEL FOR poor James Garner who hovers around the background of ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" like a eunuch in a harem. Its not because the men are portrayed so badly in this Dixiefied tale of estrogen empowerment -- believe me the women fare much worse -- but because he looks so darned embarrassed to have been cast in screenwriter Callie Khouris directorial debut. And I cant say that I blame him. Playing henpecked husband Shep to an overripe Ellen Burstyns high-strung housewife Vivi Walker Garner isnt given much to do besides roll his eyes patronizingly at the batty behavior of his volatile spouse and her three lifelong best friends Teensy (Fionnula Flanagan) Necie (Shirley Knight) and Caro (Maggie Smith). Together the quartet make up the titular Ya-Yas a long-dormant secret society dreamed up by candlelight and under the influence no doubt of too many pubescent hormones one night long ago when the four gray-haired matrons were girls. Early on in the film disaster strikes. To wit Vivi blows a gasket after successful New York playwright daughter Siddalee (Sandra Bullock) inadvertently bad-mouths her to a Time magazine reporter and then Siddalee retaliates for her mothers anger by disinviting Vivi to her upcoming wedding. Thats when the semi-retired Ya-Yas regroup sans Vivi flying from Louisiana to Manhattan to kidnap Sidda (as she is known in the land of people named Buggy and Willetta) and spirit her away to their hideout. There unbeknown to Vivi the trio hopes to defuse Siddas resentment using only a dog-eared scrapbook of yellowing photographs of the Ya-Yas as a key to unlock the hidden demons of the past. Caution You are now entering Flashback City. The film at this point hyperspaces clumsily in and out of the time stream jumping from the Ya-Yas pre- to post-adolescence with pit stops made at other ages along the way. Its all part of Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontails -- excuse me Teensy Necie and Caros -- fiendish plan to explain away Vivis abusive past by parceling it out to Sidda in enough five-minute doses to make it palatable -- not to mention a feature-length movie. Despite repeated references to a dark secret on the order of ""You mean you havent told her about it yet?"" the audience is made to keep waiting for a closure that never comes to expect a ""Prince of Tides"" moment that ultimately is no more than a washout. Mostly this is because the movie steals its own thunder. As the young adult (and earlier teenage) Vivi Ashley Judd acts more and more like Bette Davis in full freak-out mode as she ages. By the time whatever she did to Sidda is spelled out in no uncertain terms it is a kind of anticlimax. So Vivi is a loose cannon? Tell me something I dont know. Although I havent read the best-selling book on which ""Ya-Ya"" is based by nearly all accounts it is a good and satisfying yarn with a strong message of mother-daughter (and in general female) bonding. What is perhaps most disappointing about this ham-handed film though particularly since it was directed by the screenwriter of the righteously raging ""Thelma and Louise"" is its crypto-misogyny. It thinks its message is feminist but with its cast of uncommunicative annoyingly ineffectual southern-fried biddies what it really ends up saying is ""Women Cant live with em cant shoot em.""

"Vodka and Sympathy washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Vodka and Sympathy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday June 7 2002 You can pretty much divide the world into two kinds of people those who adored the novel ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" and those who didnt. Its only fair to announce that this critic fell into the latter camp. And to this sensibility parts of the filmed adaptation came off just as self-consciously quirky as the book. But its only fair to add that there is much in the movie to love especially in some winning performances by an ensemble of fabulous actresses. ""Divine Secrets"" tells the story of Siddalee Walker (Sandra Bullock) a successful New York playwright who while giving an interview to Time magazine allows as how she might not have had the most healthy of upbringings while growing up in Louisiana. This doesnt sit well at all with Siddas mother the narcissistic and high-strung Viviane Walker (Ellen Burstyn) who upon reading the article begins a full-blown Southern Gothic feud with her daughter starting with angry phone calls and ending with an escalating battle of nasty Fed Ex packages. To the rescue come the Ya-Yas Vivis best friends since childhood who travel to New York kidnap Sidda and drag her back to the bayou where they will perform a booze-and-cigarette-fueled intervention to bring mother and daughter back together. Here in the cluttered cabin where she spent most of her childhood Sidda will learn the Divine Secrets of the title -- most of which have to do with her mothers traumatic childhood tragic youth and troubled young adulthood. Although ""Divine Secrets"" derives its title from Rebecca Wellss 1997 novel much of its material comes from ""Little Altars Everywhere"" Wellss first book which introduced readers to Sidda and her severely embattled family. The film directed by screenwriter Callie Khouri unfolds in a series of flashbacks in which we meet Vivis freakish parents the World War II pilot who was the love of her life and finally the demons that drove her to despise her husband abuse her children and finally collapse in a full-blown breakdown. Ashley Judd plays the young Vivi in these sequences and delivers a performance that is by turns sexy and grim; when she plays at saving young Sidda (Allison Bertolino) during a fake-drowning game she manages to be an object of both desire and terror. But although these episodes are vividly drawn their cumulative effect is to give the movie a pasted-together quality as if each scene were a notecard on which some emblematic emotion were written. But if ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure it comes to life in the performances Judd and Burstyn share an uncanny physical resemblance making it easy to accept them as the same confounding but never unlovable woman. Splendid too are the women playing the merry band of elderly Ya-Yas Fionnula Flanagan Shirley Knight and especially Maggie Smith who as the oxygen-tank-toting Caro gets to utter the films most mordantly funny lines. (""I hope its not a real emergency I only brought one bottle of vodka"" she says early in the first of many hilarious references to the Ya-Yas beloved vices.) Even Bullock whose performances have been characterized more by charm and instinct than by pure acting talent delivers an unexpectedly deep performance as a daughter who bears more of a resemblance to her mom than she might comfortably admit. The tart often jauntily profane dialogue and sharp interactions of the present-day relationships give ""Divine Secrets"" its occasional zip; when Khouri takes us back in time especially to the Ya-Yas early childhood the movie flags. A more experienced director might have been able to relate this sprawling tale more subtly and with less visible labor. Also problematic is the films patronizing depiction of African Americans who are portrayed either as shamanistic seers (""I done heard that hoot owl last night"") beneficiaries of white virtue or conveniently available caretakers for Sidda and her siblings when Vivi goes AWOL. As uneven as ""Divine Secrets"" is at a recent screening Ya-Ya fans seemed to relish the way Smith Burstyn Bullock and their gifted co-stars brought their cherished characters to life. That half of the world will no doubt smile while watching the Ya-Yas don their proto-feminist crowns Vivi pray to the Virgin Mary while surrounded by sparklers and Sidda engage in her own ritual to become a Ya-Ya. Readers who are already gagging may want to start inventing excuses now as to why theyll have to sit this one out. DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD (PG-13 112 minutes) A?

Written and directed by Callie Khouri based on the novels ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" and ""Little Altars Everywhere"" by Rebecca Wells. 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements language and brief sensuality. Several theaters. Its unfortunate but perhaps telling that in this summers big ""womens movie"" the only characters with much sense are men. James Garner and Angus Macfadyen spend ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" listening patiently and generally being the voice of reason to a bevy of Southern Women With Issues. They are both frequently shown leaving the room; something I occasionally wished to do during the movies near-two-hour running time. Not that theres nothing to enjoy about ""Divine Secrets"" but it too frequently veers into screechy melodrama or artificially drawn-out conflict. At its heart as the novels millions of readers already know is a simple story about mothers daughters and womens friendships. Siddalee Walker (Sandra Bullock) a successful playwright and director finds that her troubled past with her flamboyant Louisiana mother Viviane (Ellen Burstyn; played in flashbacks by Ashley Judd) is affecting her relationship with her charming Irish fiance (Macfadyen). With the help of a trio of Vivis friends called the Ya-Yas who relate stories from Vivis past Sidda comes to understand her mother better. This all sounds very nice indeed and certainly there were tears and sniffles at a recent preview screening but much of the movie is so implausible that its difficult to feel connected to it. (Are elegant Southern matrons really in the habit of hopping on planes to New York in order to drug and kidnap each others daughters?) And its final revelation and lickety-split happy ending feels entirely false. Vivis ""big secret"" turns out to be something that would surely have been obvious to Sidda -- its certainly obvious to those of us watching the movie. Callie Khouri the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""Thelma amp; Louise"" makes some smart choices in her mostly faithful adaptation of Rebecca Wells novels (the screen Sidda has much more backbone). But the movie feels as crowded as its Southern-kitsch sets. Told in multilayered flashbacks (echoing the books structure) ""Divine Secrets"" is loaded with Southern eccentricity multigenerational angst and people behaving extremely oddly. And Khouri making her directing debut here cant seem to find a consistent tone -- drama and zaniness awkwardly duel throughout. A scene in which the young Vivi becomes aware of racism through the mistreatment of a beloved black maid is supposed to be powerful I think but becomes an opportunity for goofy shenanigans. Nonetheless theres pleasure to be had in seeing so many talented women on screen even if misused. Hearing Maggie Smith as a Ya-Ya growl her way into a Southern accent is a kick (she doesnt really change her own flawless Brit diction; just streeeeetches every word out like salt-water taffy). Just hearing Smith say ""Ya-Ya"" now that I think of it is more entertainment than some movies provide. Burstyn is badly misdirected here; she overacts and flails about as Vivi while James Garner lurks in the background rolling his eyes. But Judd as the younger Vivi is as vivid as her characters name suggests; her curly angelic smile and authentic Southern charm help explain why everyone in the movie seems so willing to excuse this womans many failings. (The movie rises and falls on whether we sympathize with Vivi; with the role split between Burstyn and Judd its a bumpy ride.) And Bullock who seems to have made a career out of being in the wrong movie is strangely right-on blending sophistication with a womanly believable sadness. Overall ""Divine Secrets"" feels like a very old-fashioned kind of movie; a hyper-stylized melodrama with foofy sets and Technicolor emotions. Nothing wrong with that but a little subtlety and calmness never hurt either. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Starring Sandra Bullock Ellen Burstyn and Ashley Judd. Directed by Callie Khouri. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) One woman grows up at a time when women had few opportunities. A generation later her daughter grows up and becomes a roaring success. How do such a mother and daughter get along? What are their conflicts and tensions? Its a subject rarely addressed in movies probably because the phenomenon is so new. If ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" were the 10th movie this year about such mothers and daughters it would be easy to dismiss it as a sincere but middling effort. But far from dealing with a familiar topic its delving into practically untouched territory. The result is a freshness that cant quite be spoiled by its flat narrative or static flashback structure -- two flaws that by rights should have killed it. Based on the novel by Rebecca Wells and directed by Callie Khouri (who wrote ""Thelma and Louise"") the movie exists in a universe in which one sex seems to run the world and the other exists only to supply lovers and consorts. Related Stories Video of the Week / Mother-daughter Secrets / Divine cast saves Ya-Ya Sisterhood Its the usual pattern in movies only here the consorts are men and the women are running the show. Sandra Bullock plays Sidda Lee a successful writer with a play about to open on Broadway. Interviewed by Time magazine she makes some critical remarks about her mother Vivi (Ellen Burstyn) who reads them and flies into a rage. The women are hopelessly estranged but then three of Moms childhood friends -- fellow members of the ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" -- come to New York drug Sidda Lee and drag her to her hometown in rural Louisiana where they hope to bring about a reconciliation. BEAUTIFUL SILENT SCENE ""Divine Secrets"" takes place over the course of three or four days as Moms friends tell Sidda Lee stories from Vivis life -- and we see the incidents in flashback. It strains credulity that any playwright with a show so close to a Broadway opening would willingly dither away three crucial days of rehearsal for a stroll down memory lane. But at least the movie makes good use of its artificial setup. The ""Ya-Yas"" Fionnula Flanagan Shirley Knight and Maggie Smith are fussy vivid and nicely delineated. Smith in particular is a master of subtle comedy who can steal a laugh by lifting an eyebrow. And its a continual pleasure to chart the growth of Bullock who used to be an engaging girl with dimples and has become an engaging woman with dimples flawless timing and an undercurrent of emotional turbulence. Bullock is so good that its with reluctance that we keep leaving the present and going into flashback. In flashbacks the movie stands still despite Ashley Judd who has many strong moments as the young Vivi. Judd is especially good at conveying a vivacious and intelligent womans frustration at the limits of her life. At one point she goes to confession and tells the priest that she wants to run away from her family and ""become famous"" but at what? She has powerful desires that cant be satisfied by a life as a rural wife and mother. Judd has a beautiful moment of silent acting in which Vivi as a young mother in her 30s just looks at herself in the mirror. Nothing is stated but we know that Vivi is assessing her looks how much is left how much is gone and wondering how she got here. She cant know that she was born a generation too soon. REVELATION OVERPLAYED And yet for all that despite Judd and despite Burstyns flamboyance as the older Vivi the character feels underdeveloped. ""Divine Secrets"" is a kind of Monster Mother movie but unlike say ""Postcards From the Edge"" or even ""Mommie Dearest"" it leaves the mothers monstrousness and the source of her dissatisfaction only sketchily defined. Were told her story but that story isnt revealed in a way that emotionally lands. The movie also banks too much on a revelation near the finish that registers as just mildly important even though everyone in the movie carries on as if its earthshaking. Mother-daughter stories are invariably written from the standpoint of the daughter probably the less interesting of the two viewpoints. As a result theres a tendency to see the mothers life as mere prelude and no matter what attempts are made to present Mother as a distinct person she always morphs into Mom. In that way ""Divine Secrets"" is predictable. But at least it feels real. Khouri fills the flashbacks with accurate period detail -- the clothing knickknacks clocks and cars even the attitudes -- so that we sense the passage of time and appreciate the storys span. Theres no denying that ""Divine Secrets"" is a clumsy journey but at the end we know weve been places.

"CNN.com - Review Ya-Ya a pandering cliche - June 7 2002 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 Review Ya-Ya a pandering cliche Overacted overripe version of bestseller By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Callie Khouris ""Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" is a certifiable ""chick flick"" pre-chewed and delivered in a burped Tupperware container. This is not a good thing. Note that ""chick flick"" -- a singsong phrase that efficiently denigrates both women and cinema -- doesnt mean ""good-quality movie."" All it means is that the mother-daughter story the characters overripe names the boozy Southern setting and the virtually non-stop arguments are mirror images of 15 other chick flicks. That in itself is supposed to make it captivating entertainment. If only. Khouri won an Oscar for her first screenplay ""Thelma and Louise"" a supposed feminist tract that has as much to do with ""Smokey and the Bandit"" as it does Gloria Steinem. ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" is her directorial debut and it practically lies down and wallows in its mega-hammy ""I Am Woman"" tone. The performances with a couple of exceptions are so over-the-top they wouldnt look out of place on theater night at the nuthouse. And the storys central thesis -- namely that mean unloving self-centered people often have every reason to be that way -- is pretty questionable. Outside of some touching scenes in the late going this is a great big screeching pander to a pre-established audience and everybody else should just get out of the way.

"USATODAY.com - Ya-Ya is so-so except for Burstyn Bullock Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/07/2002 - Updated 0929 AM ET Ya-Ya is so-so except for Burstyn Bullock By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Ellen Burstyn left and Sandra Bullock in Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. OK the sisterhood part is obvious but where are the big secrets in Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood? The movie is entertaining and the characters engaging enough but one comes away from the experience wondering what all the fuss was about. A self-absorbed young mother has a nervous breakdown. Later her adult daughter struggles with residual resentment and confusion. You expect the revelation of truly deep dark secrets. Instead you walk out wondering ""Is that all there is?"" Read more below Related story Real-life Ya-Yas Video View trailer for Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood Watch a clip from the film What leaves a lasting impression is the indomitable healing bond of friendship between a quartet of women who call themselves ""Ya-Ya priestesses."" We meet them as adventurous little girls and later as eccentric dowagers. The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (out of four) Stars Sandra Bullock Ashley Judd Ellen Burstyn Maggie Smith. Director Callie Khouri Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic elements language and brief sexuality. The movie adaptation of Rebecca Wells 1996 best seller is in the vein of The Joy Luck Club and How to Make an American Quilt. Its a predictable chick flick raised to a level above soap opera by an impressive cast. Ellen Burstyn is right on the mark as Vivi the cantankerous but charming senior Southern belle who is estranged from Sidda her accomplished but wounded daughter played winningly by Sandra Bullock. The straightforward direction by Callie Khouri -- best known for writing Thelma amp; Louise -- steers clear of mawkish sentimentality. Vivi is played in youth by Ashley Judd who captures the characters high-strung charisma but doesnt provide much emotional heft. Were not convinced shes suffering as she makes periodic trips to the confessional or slips out of town. Its hard to picture that someone so lacking in substance could grow into the complex and irascible persona of Burstyns Vivi. The Ya-Yas in their seventh decade still love a joy ride in a speeding convertible and a stiff drink. Never mind the oxygen tank one has to drag around. Theyre a hoot. Burstyn is joined by stalwart veterans Maggie Smith Fionnula Flanagan and Shirley Knight. The only character we get to know fully as she evolves from child to older woman is Vivi. Too bad the movie didnt also trace the lives of her ""sisters."" That might have been divine.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.
