The basic story is intriguing and with Foster and supersonic producer Brian Grazer aboard there was a real prospect for a high-flying thriller. The filmmakers rounded up a solid supporting cast featuring Peter Sarsgaard Sean Bean and Erika Christensen. The performances including that of two-time Academy Award winner Foster are intense and frantic but evoke little resonance or empathy. German independent director Robert Schwentke makes a technically sturdy Hollywood debut yet he is able to eke out little more than moments of brooding atmosphere and a few climactic chills from a screenplay by Peter A. Dowling and Billy Ray that moves from implausible to farfetched to absurd. PG-13 for violence and some intense plot material. 97 min. One and a half stars out of four. - David Germain AP Movie Writer --- ""A History of Violence"" - The less you know about this movie before seeing it - and you really should see it - the better. And yet theres so much to say its hard not to want to ramble on. So well just say this David Cronenbergs latest twisting thriller probably will appeal to a wider audience than his more daring films like ""Naked Lunch"" and ""Crash"" but is no less penetrating in its insights into human nature. The story of an Indiana family whose small-town idyll is shattered by violence offers a searing examination of how far people will go under duress of the darkness that reveals itself during unexpected circumstances. Performances are uniformly excellent from a beautifully chosen cast especially Viggo Mortensen as the mild-mannered patriarch (though as his character evolves hes essentially playing two roles distinctly and believably); Maria Bello who plays his wife with powerful understatement; and William Hurt in a brief but scene-stealing cameo as a passively menacing Philadelphia mob boss. R for brutal violence graphic sexuality nudity language and some drug use. 98 min. Three and a half stars out of four. - Christy Lemire AP Movie Critic --- ""Oliver Twist"" - After the devastating emotional rawness of Roman Polanskis Holocaust drama ""The Pianist"" the directors take on the Charles Dickens classic is an oddly distant and disappointing affair. Other than its rich technically sumptuous re-creation of 19th century London and a wickedly gnarled performance by Ben Kingsley as den of thieves master Fagin Polanskis version has little to distinguish it from the many other fine and proper adaptations of the orphan boys adventures. Barney Clark plays young Oliver a chin-up survivor struggling to overcome an upbringing among workhouse tyrants cruel employers and vicious street thugs. Polanski presents a dazzling portrait of the 1830s London slums yet the drama itself is lackluster. Coming from Polanski you expect surprises unconventionality and emotional resonance. You expect pardon the pun some real twists. PG-13 for disturbing images. 130 min. Two and a half stars out of four. - David Germain AP Movie Writer --- ""Roll Bounce"" - Theres more stuff going on in this 70s roller boogie comedy-drama-romance than there are mirrored panels on a disco ball. Crammed with enough real-life traumas and feel-good turnarounds to fill a couple of after-school specials the film from director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man"" ""Undercover Brother"") is well-intentioned but wildly uneven. But it does have an undeniable energy during the skating sequences which feature elaborate choreography - imagine ""Breakin"" on wheels. And the artist formerly known as Lil Bow Wow - who now goes by just Bow Wow- shows hes a confident natural actor as he emerges from his teens and from earlier more youthful roles in movies like ""Like Mike."" Chi McBride and Meagan Good co-star. PG-13 for language and some crude humor. 107 min. Two stars out of four. - Christy Lemire AP Movie Critic --- ""Daltry Calhoun"" - This probably is not the movie that will finally force us to consider Johnny Knoxville as a serious actor - its too slight too unfocused. But starring in the title role as a small-town sod salesman whos losing his business while gaining the daughter he hasnt seen in years Knoxville shows he has planted the seeds for a career that should blossom into something varied and unexpected. Knoxville plays the part with a mix of down-home good-ol-boy charm and believable awkwardness and some of the best scenes are the ones he shares with newcomer Sophie Traub as his daughter June a 14-year-old musical prodigy. Elizabeth Banks and Juliette Lewis play the once and future loves of his life respectively. Both bring some heart to roles that start out as twangy Southern stereotypes. PG-13 for sexual content drug material and language. 87 min. Two stars out of four. - Christy Lemire AP Movie Critic Related Searches VIGGO MORTENSEN OLIVER TWIST ARTIST JULIETTE LEWIS INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR THE BEST MAN SEAN BEAN CRASH PHILADELPHIA ENTERTAINMENT_CULTURE JOHNNY KNOXVILLE DIRECTOR JODIE FOSTER CONFIDENT NATURAL ACTOR SERIOUS ACTOR BILLY RAY CRASH PETER A.

His second film of the year ""Corpse Bride"" seems bathed in the milk of inhuman kindness. This stop-action animated feature is downright sweet and tender as well as all the other things weve come to expect from him -- funny bizarre graphically stunning and blithely necrophilic. Maybe its the influence of his co-director Mike Johnson or the nature of the material which derives from a Russian folk tale or some felicitous synergy involving the writers John August Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler. Whoever or whatever may be responsible the result is an endearing ease and expansiveness (within a running time of only 76 minutes) thats been missing from Mr. Burtons recent work including last summers ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" You know something special is going on when youre instantly smitten along with the Victorian bridegroom by a winsome blue-faced maggot-ridden bride who is not just anorexic but skeletal and irreversibly if seductively dead. Part of the appeal of the films genial puppetry lies in the voices of a marvelous cast Helena Bonham Carter as Corpse Bride; Johnny Depp as her wide-eyed pinch-faced groom Victor; Emily Watson as Victoria the flesh-and-blood beauty to whom Victor was originally betrothed; Joanna Lumley as Victorias aristocratic trowel-chinned mother; Albert Finney as her squashed fireplug of a father (who sometimes sounds like Sidney Greenstreet) and lesser though no less amusing characters and creatures voiced by Tracey Ullman Paul Whitehouse Christopher Lee Michael Gough and Jane Horrocks. And by Danny Elfman the composer of the macabre music that has helped define Tim Burtons movies ever since ""Pee-Wees Big Adventure"" 20 years ago Mr. Elfman lends his voice to Bonejangles the leader of a manic band called the Skeletones that comes on like an old Cab Calloway revue. But the verve and variety of these voices is matched by a story thats beguiling in its simplicity (Victor is truly torn between the living and the dead); by music that cheerfully mimics composers as diverse as Kurt Weill and Gilbert and Sullivan; by witty dialogue often delivered in rhyme (""I know that I am dead"" says Corpse Bride ruefully ""yet it seems that I still have some tears to shed""); and a visual scheme that fairly bursts -- inside little Expressionist sets -- with pleasing surprises of which Ill semi-divulge only one Life is much more colorful among the dead than the living. Pleasing is the operative word here. Theres a modest tossed-off quality to the film even though the process that brought it to the screen is extremely arduous. (In fleeting tribute to the master of stop-motion animation Ray Harryhausen Victor is seen playing a Harryhausen piano.) Its a studio release that doesnt feel like one -- no pounding away for emotional impact no grotesquely out-of-scale effects no smash finish. Energy abounds -- skeletons dancing in a cabaret evoke the crude kinetic joy of Walt Disneys earliest cartoons -- but ""Corpse Bride"" also takes time to smell the wilted roses as in an unhurried encounter when Victor and his unanimate inamorata play a pensive piano duet. Who knew that death could be so vital? A History of Violence ENLARGE Maria Bello and Viggo Mortensen star in David Cronenbergs A History of Violence. Speaking of surprises -- and theyre the lifeblood of drama -- David Cronenbergs new thriller ""A History of Violence"" has a couple of crucial ones that may not prove all that surprising. This peculiarly predictable picture has been calculated or miscalculated to set up certain expectations fulfill them and then do the same thing again thereby giving us a chance to see whats coming and at least in theory be shocked when it actually comes. Does that make any sense? Probably not but Im trying to abide by a ""note to the press"" handed out before the picture was screened that urged me and my ilk not to ""reveal any of the dramatic plot twists or character developments when writing/broadcasting your pieces."" All right then but Im not sure what else there is to write/broadcast about. Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall a man of quiet virtue living with his wife (Maria Bello) and their two kids in a small conspicuously peaceful Indiana town. Im revealing something though not much when I tell you that neither the town nor the Stall familys life remains peaceful for very long after a thug played by Ed Harris shows up to insist that Tom is someone else. Or that some of the inspiration for the uninspiring story which Josh Olson adapted for the screen from a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke might have come from Alfred Hitchcocks ""Shadow of a Doubt."" ENLARGE Barney Clark plays Oliver Twist in Roman Polanskis new version of the Charles Dickens classic. Mr. Mortensen an actor with a quietly commanding presence puts Tom through interesting changes that may or may not qualify as character development. Peter Suschitzkys cinematography gives the film a fine noir sheen. And in the all-important department of product placement Mr. Harris rides around in a black Chrysler 300 sedan that looks menacing enough to establish itself as the modern-day successor to those Cadillac thugmobiles of old. Oliver Twist The dramatic problem inherent in any adaptation of ""Oliver Twist"" is the young heros passivity. Apart from asking for More Oliver adapts to whatever fortune good or ill comes his way. The dramatic engine is the callousness or outright cruelty surrounding the innocent boy; thats personified by Fagin and Bill Sikes who were played respectively by Alec Guinness and Robert Newton in David Leans classic 1948 version. (A great score and glorious spectacle also propelled ""Oliver"" the matchless 1968 musical directed by Carol Reed.) But two dramatic problems beset Roman Polanskis darkly handsome new film of the Dickens novel. The boy is as passive as ever and bleak in the bargain -- instead of glowing like the Oliver of the musical he takes light in -- while Ben Kingsleys Fagin and Jamie Foremans Bill Sikes manage to make villainy a bit of a bore. Its not that the performances are bad only that they lack luster. (Even the new Dodger isnt very artful.) In contrast to Alec Guinnesss extravagantly ghastly Fagin a portrayal that elicited protests of anti-Semitism in the United States this latest Fagin is grubby and ugly but recessive and diminished a nutty old victim in his own right. And Bill Sikes has become a slightly tedious psychopath. I know its unserious to say so but I kept hoping someone would break out in song. Dear Wendy ENLARGE Jamie Bell (left) and Danso Gordon in Dear Wendy Guns make the man in ""Dear Wendy"" a dogged Danish parable about weaponry and violence in America. (Wendy is in fact a handgun to whom or which its owner speaks lovingly in seemingly endless voice-overs.) Directed in English by Thomas Vinterberg from a didactic script by Lars von Trier the film purports to be set in a rural town called Estherslope somewhere in the American southeast. Visually as well as verbally everythings either slightly off-kilter or as American as Danish pastry but thats a small matter in comparison to what passes for a plot and is a pretext for pretentious philosophizing. (Mr. von Trier is the man who perpetrated the lofty condescensions of last years ""Dogville."") Wendys owner a wistful young misfit named Dick Dandelion (Jamie Bell) teams up with another loner to form the Dandies a club of self-described pacifists with guns. What the filmmakers want the Dandies to teach us is that guns give their owners a sense of power (you heard it here first); that power -- even pacifist power -- corrupts and that America is gun-crazy. Maybe so but the movies smugness is insufferable.    DVD TIP The living also find themselves inconveniently dead in Tim Burtons ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) which with Michael Keaton Geena Davis Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder is one of the funniest ghost stories ever made. At least half of it is -- up to and including a dinner party whose guests are possessed by the need to sing ""Day-O"" Harry Belafontes Banana Boat Song. The second half is merely wonderful.

Indeed its apparent effortlessness in transcending simple generic concerns to interrogate a range of issues surrounding violence justice heroism and identity should not distract attention from its subtly subversive critique of the American Dream (or should one say nightmare?). Diner proprietor Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) his lawyer wife Edie (Maria Bello) and their two kids seem to have a pretty idyllic existence in smalltown America until a couple of gleefully murderous hoods turn up by chance at the eaterie and an order for coffee escalates to terrorising Tom and his customers. Quick thinking on his part leads to reluctant celebrity - and still more unwelcome - further visits from sinister wise guys hinting that Tom may not be quite the clean-cut Ordinary Joe he says he is. Besides playing fast and loose (in the most elegantly rigorous way of course) with family-under-siege thriller conventions Cronenberg deftly undermines narrative expectations by implying that happy families may in fact be forms of imprisonment and that trying to conform to an American way may involve lying to ourselves and others about the very human capacity for monstrosity. Here as a repressed past erupts with a vengeance violence begets violence and safe traditional ethics are swiftly revealed as virtually irrelevant. All this is executed with Cronenbergs now customarily brilliant wit bravura style and perfect pacing not to mention peak-form performances from a superb cast that memorably includes William Hurt and Ed Harris. Unlike the tough but unremarkable pulp fiction of the original graphic novel  the film (which differs from the book in numerous important respects) succeeds not only in terms of action and suspense but as cautionary fable historical allegory social satire and moral disquisition. In short its marvellous and up there with Spider as Cronenbergs very best work.

There was good acting by classy actors. All of the main actors were a credit to the movie and the director. Obviously for that to happen the director did a fine job. To put it a little more into perspective however this movie sought to appeal to our basic instincts of the ""good"" guy beating the bad guy. This is probably partly because it rarely happens in real life but quite often in Reel Life. From that perspective it has similarities to Rocky and Rambo. The movie has an interesting twist insofar as most of us think that the ""hero"" is not actually the bad guy initially. As he begins to get into the car with Harris it appears he will go to ""Philly"" and all will be sorted out. The one thing that I found unrealistic and unlikely was the reaction of his family to his alter ego Joey. I guess that the sex scene on the stairs was to show us the double standards of his wife to the extra persona of her husband. I gave the movie 7 out of 10. That may appear a little light on but that is to reflect why this movie has the appeal that it does. Although highly entertaining it is because of the main reasons it is appealing.

Edwards Sentinel Staff WritersA judge sentenced a 22-year-old Orange County man to life in prison without parole Thursday in a 2006 fatal shooting during a drug deal gone wrong.Deangelo Conner was convicted last month of first-degree murder armed robbery and two counts of robbery with a firearm.Florida law required Circuit Judge Bob Wattles to sentence Conner to life in prison for the murder conviction.Conner had turned down a 25-year plea offer and took his chances at trial.His first trial ended in a mistrial after jurors were heard discussing the case before it was allowed.Authorities say Conner shot Ricardo Rivera 41 once in the chest July 6 2006.Conner and two others initially set up the meeting as a drug buy but they never intended to pay for anything the prosecution said; the three planned to grab the drugs and run.At one point Conner pulled out a gun and fired at Rivera. Conner told investigators that Rivera was charging toward him and he was merely protecting himself.The jury didnt buy it.Several of Ricardo Riveras relatives attended the sentencing including his children and brother Robert Rivera who read statements from several people.In a statement Ricardo Riveras ex-wife wrote that the hardest thing she has had to do was tell her children they no longer had a father.The woman wrote that her familys hurt will never go away.

Weve already witnessed what sort of men these are in the opening minutes of David Cronenbergs vigorously sublime take on guilt and innocence the damned and the redeemed. At a roadside motel with cicadas buzzing they prove themselves pure predators two-legged sharks lacking conscience. Weve also seen what sort of man Stall might be. When his towheaded daughter wakes screaming from a nightmare he is the first to her bedside. The rest of the household comes running too teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes) followed by lovely wife Edie (Maria Bello). With each new family member the scene takes on a confusing comical tone with stilted dialogue and delivery. The clumsiness is intentional. So when the bad men arrive at Stalls restaurant in Millbrook Ind. were in for a showdown between good and evil. Only good doesnt seem to have a chance. ""Coffee"" one bad guy demands. And pie he adds. With his unwanted customers edge sharpening Stall tells his waitress quietly that she can leave. Hell serve them their pie. What Stall serves is exquisitely swift justice. In an adrenaline-pumped heartbeat Stall is a hero locally and beyond. Later in a hospital room he watches as newscasts sing his praise. Instead of slipping into comfy obscurity Stalls 15 minutes of heroism invite more bad men. They threaten the loving relationship he enjoys not just with Edie but with the Midwest town that has embraced him. Ed Harris brings brewing menace and a stubborn certainty to Carl Fogarty. Fogarty has traveled a long way because he believes he knows Stall from years earlier. Stall says otherwise. Given the history Fogarty reveals youd think he would remember. But like Stalls family his friends even the sheriff youre sure Fogarty is mistaken. At least you hope he is. Bad men who ride into town with the laconic hush of outlaws. An upstanding family whose love tastes nearly saccharine. Flashes of violence stirred and shaken with willfully overripe dialogue. These are all signs that Cronenberg is toying with the Western a genre that not only staked its claim to the American imagination but underscored our relationship to violence. (Howard Shores evocative and spare score adds to the films lyrical but knowingly nostalgic feel.) ""A History of Violence"" written by Josh Olson is loosely based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. Cronenberg takes seriously the notion of the pulp in this fiction. Bullets destroy flesh. Gunshots leave visually confounding viscera Is that a jaw? Cronenberg is hellbent on saying something about masculinity and the genealogy of brutality. (Jack has his own bad boy to face down - a high school bully.) And Cronenberg intends to have some fun saying it. With the help of a stellar cast he does. Bello (""The Cooler"") continues to impress; her Edie a lawyer is nobodys fool. And Bello makes knowing - then not - whether Edie has been fooled by her husband the existential crisis it would be. In Mortensen Cronenberg has an actor who can pull off the gentle innocence and spring-action volatility that makes Tom a character to root for and maybe fear. One thing is for certain seldom has marital sex onscreen been so touching so erotic. And when a scene of hot playfulness meets its double later in a scene of rough desperation Bello and Mortensen reveal a hard truth about intimacy. With William Hurts arrival things get laugh-out-loud funny. Some might think Hurts over- the-top turn as a put-upon mobster betrays Cronenbergs more thoughtful insights. Yet the directors pleasure - and ours - in these scenes puts a sharp point on everything. A history of violence even moviedoms version is a hard thing to shake.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

If fantasies of the king of Middle-earth kicking butt is what it takes to bring the curious to David Cronenbergs brilliant movie -- without a doubt one of the very best of the year -- then Im all for misdirection. But you deserve to know that the tease echoed in the pictures blunt title -- the B-movie come-on that heres an action picture about bloody vengeance in a small town -- is a perverse simplification of everything that makes the movie great. In my ideal coming attraction wed see little more than scenes of utmost dailiness Mortensen as family man Tom Stall passionately in love with his wife Edie (Maria Bello) happy with his kids content in the friendly business of running a neighborhood diner in Millbrook Ind. and blessed with average taken-for-granted American freedom and prosperity at its most Rockwellian. Thats it thats the setup with maybe the merest hint that Tom becomes an unwilling local hero when he defends his place of business against vicious would-be robbers who threaten his fellow citizens. For visual spice a few glimpses of Mortensen and Bello engaged in conjugal bliss would suffice. Come for the calm stay for the storm because the movie is about the opposite of revenge. Its about the violence that surpasseth all understanding -- a cataclysm of awful (and sometimes funny and sometimes horrifying) consequence that unfolds with insidious intimacy and a Cronenbergian delight in the animal squish and shock of torn bodies. Toms newfound media exposure (""Its the best thing anyone could have done to them"" he naively blurts to a TV reporter about his brush with the diner bad guys) brings him to the attention of menacing out-of-towners who cruise into Millbrook in a big black car none more menacing than the silky scar-faced thug who calls himself Fogarty (Ed Harris) and claims to know Tom as a killer named Joey. ""They dont like this guy they think you are"" Edie says trying to make sense of the absurd alternate reality that begins to consume the entire Stall household. Who is this average Joe? Whether violence begets violence whether perception is reality whether a destructive animal instinct for combat really is lodged in the peaceful heart of every man -- these are the themes that entertain Cronenberg the Canadian original who made Dead Ringers and The Fly. (Also up for discussion Whether the gunshot blast that shatters the small-town peace is a particularly American scenario.) But in his most deceptively ""mainstream"" of entertainments the filmmaker is enthralled too by the simple mechanics -- the visceral fun -- of making movies. Theres not a scene wasted in the 97-minute unspooling not a detour that doesnt tell surprise horrify delight. (At times our laughter is as shocking a response as our excitement and theres plenty of cause for it when William Hurt makes a galloping cameo appearance.) Theres not a slack measure of music either in Howard Shores resonant score which plays off the plainspoken aural simplicity associated with Aaron Copland to convey the melody of people who feel caged by dread even though theyre surrounded by prairie bigness. A History of Violence began as a graphic novel written by John Wagner and Vince Locke and the well-built screenplay by Josh Olson reflects the black-and-white speed of the original medium. But much of the movies richness comes from the way the filmmaker takes detours along the road to the Stall family catastrophe finding expressions of psychic entropy even in the way the Stalls sit at the breakfast table. A world of change -- a fall from innocence -- is enacted in two contrasting sex scenes between husband and wife while some of the best most powerful moments are those that occur between Tom and his teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes making a terrific feature-film debut) a baffled kid undergoing his own crash course in adult ethics. A History of Violence is fundamentally a history of men at the throats of other men; Edie is the sole woman in this American tragedy and although the character is given dignity and autonomy (Bello imparts information about Edie with physical precision never standing next to Mortensen the same way twice) its a testosterone jungle out there. That its also a Garden of Eden gone poisonous -- to hell -- is something no coming attraction can convey. 2006 Oscar Nominations Best Supporting Actor (William Hurt); Best Adapted Screenplay (Josh Olson) Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Nick Jonas Demi Lovato send fans on scavenger hunt for concert tickets Pokemon Go nests are reportedly spawning different Pokemon Disney changes Avengers Infinity War Part 1 title Constance Wu says Matt Damons Great Wall perpetuates racist myth Shelley Long joins road trip film Different Flowers Relive Hillary Clinton dancing to the Macarena at the 1996 DNC Bad Boys 3 director to write Uncharted movie adaptation Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

"The Likable Face of Violence washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies The Likable Face of Violence Ed Harris left claims to have the goods on Viggo Mortensen in ""A History of Violence."" (By Takashi Seida -- New Line Cinema Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 23 2005 ""Whatever it is I fear Greeks even when they bring gifts"" says Laocoon in Virgils ""Aeneid"" as he and his fellow Trojans contemplated the enormous wooden horse outside their fortified walls. His instincts are right A contingent of Greek warriors lay huddled inside waiting for the right moment to release the hatch and rout Troy. ""A History of Violence"" is a Trojan horse with a similarly nasty surprise. Packed inside David Cronenbergs latest film which presents itself as gift-wrapped shoot-em-up entertainment is a sobering reflection on our cultures attitude toward violence. By making us root for a very likable small-town hero (Viggo Mortensen) who must resort to extreme measures to protect himself and his family from thugs the Canadian filmmaker is essentially forcing us to confront troubling questions. Is killing excused by moral imperative? Where does heroism end and vigilantism begin? Cronenberg cannily references the Western mythology of Hollywood as he lures us into the heartland community of Tom Stall (Mortensen). Everyone knows each other in this sleepy Indiana hamlet pop. 3246 and nothing much happens except the raising of families churchgoing and the pursuit of happiness. Tom runs the most popular diner in Millbrook. He kisses his wife Edie (Maria Bello) before he goes to work cheerfully picks up trash on the street on his way into the restaurant. Edies a devoted wife a powerful lawyer and a good mother to their two children and when the bedroom door is closed she knows how to play naughty. ""Be quiet"" she whispers into Toms ear skimped out in a cheerleader skirt. ""My parents are in the next room."" The object of this seduction however isnt Tom. Its us. Cronenberg is hooking the audience into Toms life and by extension small-town America. By the time two threatening strangers (Stephen McHattie and Greg Bryk) barge into Stalls Diner around closing time were ready to get behind Tom in anything he does. Little do we suspect our trust and empathy will become treacherous liabilities. When Tom tells the intruders his kitchen is closed the men become belligerent. Moments later Tom his staff and a few stragglers are staring at drawn guns. When one stranger aims his weapon at the waitress by the door Tom swings his coffeepot into the other mans face grabs his gun and pumps the second gunman with bullets. The first man plunges a knife into his foot before Tom dispatches him too. Tom is stunningly efficient and were too exhilarated to consider the gory aftermath. But Cronenberg refuses to spare us the spattery details. The faces of the slain -- in this and subsequent scenes -- arent just bloodied; theyre grotesquely disfigured. Within 24 hours Toms a media hero. The assailants lie toe-tagged in the morgue. When Tom emerges bandaged and triumphant from the hospital Millbrook residents are waiting to applaud. Evil has been overcome -- or has it? After his own personal Morning in America Tom gets another unsavory visitor at the diner. This time its Carl Fogaty (Ed Harris) a grim individual who hides a terrible scar behind his shades. Flanked by dark-suited goons he parks in front of Toms counter and sarcastically compliments his heroism. He insists on calling him Joey. ""Whos Joey?"" asks Tom puzzled. ""You are"" says Carl who claims to know Tom from a previous chapter in his life. He wonders aloud how it is exactly that an unassuming diner proprietor could shoot so expertly. Although Tom gets the sheriff to chase Carl out of town its not the last Toms family will hear of him. Despite Toms insistence that he was ""just lucky"" Edie begins to wonder. Has Tom been living a double life? Who is the man that fathered her children who sleeps by her side? The filmmaker who gave us ""Spider"" ""The Fly"" ""eXistenZ"" ""Crash"" and ""Naked Lunch"" -- stories about shadow lives -- slowly begins to tear the gift-wrap. Toms socially withdrawn son Jack (Ashton Holmes) has been suffering at the hands of a high school bully. After he watches his father transform from coffee pourer to family defender he changes too. ""In this family we do not solve problems by hitting people"" says Tom after Jack has been taken before the principal. ""No"" retorts Jack. ""In this family we shoot them."" And the audience erupts with laughter. But the gallows humor is really Cronenbergs subtle warning that our first reactions arent necessarily the right ones. The possibility that Tom isnt everything we believed in is also taking uncomfortable root. Whether theres anything to this suspicion is the exciting business of the rest of the movie. As climactic events unfold little touches earlier in the film -- such as Toms daughter waking up screaming from a nightmare about monsters -- illustrate the ominous underpinnings that were always there. ""A History of Violence"" forces us to confront our Pavlovian conditioning to violence whether we are watching real military campaigns with living room detachment or whooping and hollering for fictional ones. Its not about popcorn heroism or the importance of protecting an increasingly troubled world against hostile invaders. Its just about why were cheering. A History of Violence (95 minutes at Loews Georgetown) is rated R for extreme violence graphic sexuality profanity and some drug use.

Thats not a bad way to explain what a director must do to fashion a lasting movie -- or even a good one. Not what it seems Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) fights back against hoods. New Line Productions But in this case the conspiracy is more complicated as Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello headline white-hot melodrama contrasted visually with austere rural Indiana. You can easily envision viewers flinching at director David Cronenbergs theme the frightening fury that can lurk inside even the most easygoing people. But deep down many of these same viewers may get jollies watching a string of threatening cruds getting their spleens rearranged. Violence is in the spirit of the hardest-hitting film noir offerings from the 50s but far more explicit. Its also in the spirit of the Western. In fact 1955s At Gunpoint starring Fred MacMurray begins much the same way Baddies ride into town to stir up severe trouble only to be dispatched by the most mild-mannered guy on the block. (Here its Mortensen.) About the movie A History of Violence     Stars Viggo Mortensen Maria Bello Ed Harris William Hurt Director David Cronenberg Distributor New Line Cinema Rating R for strong brutal violence graphic sexuality nudity language and some drug use. Running time 1 hour 36 minutes Opens today in select cities Almost from the get-go Violence is packed with twists that reviewers should talk around instead of about -- and the movies distributor has gently requested that the movie press button it up some. Suffice it to say that Viggo goes where Fred never did -- and were not even talking about breaking bones but robust sex with his wife (Bello). This folks-at-home encounter is a key early benchmark because a) it establishes that a marriage soon to be put on the line (a key plot point) is fundamentally strong; and b) the scenes sense of adventure shrewdly prepares us to expect anything. Almost immediately things get a lot crazier Mortensens flash heroics his picture published in the paper and invading Philly hoods who have seen it and are convinced that hes a long-lost ""one of them."" But is he? Keeping us totally grabbed as we debate this are a fabulous Ed Harris in Blues Brothers shades as a mutilated Mob smoothie; the best William Hurt in years; and career-topping work by both leads. Always keeping us unbalanced Violence finally seems less eccentric than scintillatingly original. In Cronenbergs canon it belongs in the same breath as The Fly and Dead Ringers.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 23 2005 741 AM Art for Arteries Sake The bloody fatalism of David Cronenbergs A History of Violence. By David Edelstein Mortenson makes his mysterious character believable Violence is the dominant cuisine of world cinema so any movie that seems to critique it while serving up a scrum-dilly-icious platter of blood and shattered cartilage is bound to get some critics hollering ""Masterpiece"" Thats what you might be hearing about David Cronenbergs A History of Violence (New Line)--and it is an absolutely sensational piece of filmmaking. Its staged and shot and acted and scored like nothing else this year and it has images that will lodge themselves in your brain rather like an ice pick. I have nothing bad to say about it--except that it shouldnt for a second be taken too seriously. The movie belongs to a hallowed but problematic genre guilty pulp. Here you have your cake but choke on it too. The modern apex is the vigilante Western Unforgiven in which a return to bloodshed costs the hero his soul--but the higher price (for him and at the box office) would have been leaving his buddy unavenged. A closer comparison is the tony The Road to Perdition based on a graphic novel (the comic books highbrow cousin) a Charles Bronson picture in Oscar-bait clothes complete with a handy anti-violence message thats delivered with perfect timing after the bad guys have been blown away. Advertisement Another graphic-novel adaptation (by Josh Olson from a work by John Wagner and Vince Locke) A History of Violence is better by miles than that pretentious perdition-bricked Road but its steeped in the same kind of fatalism. It opens with a single lengthy take The camera travels along the flat exterior of a cheap motel in front of which two low-life homicidal scumbags make banal small talk before killing an entire family including a little girl. This happens off-screen thank God but nothing that follows does. When the child is shot theres a cut from the gun blast to another little girl as she wakes from a nightmare screaming. Her daddy Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) tells her its OK there are no monsters--when of course we know there are. The setting is a picture-perfect Midwest town and Tom and his pretty ex-cheerleader now-lawyer wife Edie (Maria Bello) have a picture-perfect homestead. Tom is picture-perfect too with his sky-blue eyes and rangy diffidence. He owns a luncheonette on the main street (Main Street?) and serves up pie and coffee while chatting about the weather and he would seem to be the very image of Norman Rockwell wholesomeness if not for those killers from the opening sequence passing through town in need of fast cash and-- Well Im not going to spoil anything no sir. But its fair to say A History of Violence revolves around a momentous secret. Either Tom is not what he appears to be or a bad case of mistaken identity is going to force him to become something other than what he is. By and by three more bad men--dark-suited gangsters--saunter into the luncheonette. Their leader Fogarty (Ed Harris) has a mottled milky dead eye which nonetheless fastens on Tom. Fogarty repeatedly calls him ""Joey"" as in ""Good coffee Joey"" to which Tom responds with polite incomprehension. Its a fascinating exchange pitting Mortensons tense easiness against Harris easy tension. Whether hes Joey or not the heroic act of violence that puts Tom in the public eye will beget violence and more violence. And Cronenberg gives it a super-kinetic charge along with the explosive compression of great comic book (sorry graphic novel) frames. The sudden bloody discharges are lightning-fast and deliciously satisfying--orgasmic even. But they also leave you sickened because Cronenberg cuts briefly--in an extra frame like a comic books (sorry graphic novels)--to men with heads shattered and faces beaten literally to bloody pulps. Advertisement But heres the thing Those extra frames dont sicken us morally. Even though A History of Violence is suffused with loss--its in every bar of Howard Shores gorgeous elegiac score his plangent Americana darkened with Bartok-like ""night-music"" dissonances--the right people are always on the right end of the (righteous) violence. Theres never a second in which the heros killings suggest that he has truly lost his soul. And hes so virtuosic in the way he delivers death that the subsequent messes seem like moral ass-savings--like Cronenberg saying ""This is more than a Steven Seagal movie."" Its the same with the pictures parallel subplot in which Toms shrinking slightly effeminate son (Ashton Holmes in an impressive debut that evokes Bruce Davisons Willard) stands up to a bully with the improbable technique of a practiced fighter. To paraphrase Clint ""An adolescent who wants to be a mans gotta do what an adolescent who wants to be a mans gotta do."" A History of Violence does have dissonances beyond Shores music. The Midwest landscape as photographed by Peter Suschitzky is a stablizing force yet it isnt pastoral or idealized. Its also a place in which to hide. When a police chief warns the gangsters that the town ""protects its own"" hes both reassuring and unnerving. After all it might protect them from people like us as well. Two remarkable sex scenes add even more wrinkles. The first is a piece of nostalgic play-acting for which Edie dons her cheerleader outfit and Tom lovingly services her. The second is its opposite a rape that is scarily unresolved--a thrill that remains a violation. In these and other scenes Bello gives the film an emotional core and Mortensens transitions are so subtle that you almost buy his barely credible character. (If an ex-gangster he is too corn-fed; if a corn-fed Midwesterner his instincts are too Seagal-like.) Harris and later William Hurt give bravura performances--laugh-out-loud over-the-top but with shockingly vicious underbellies. Thats how I think of A History of Violence--as laughably over-the-top and shockingly vicious. But what strikes some critics as complexity feels to me like shame--the shame of Cronenberg an uncompromising director whose bloodshed has always been genuinely horrifying. As a gun for hire he will surely have his biggest hit since The Fly by delivering simpleminded pulp violence--and like his hero delivering it a little too triumphantly... 442 a.m. P.T.

Starring Viggo Mortensen Ed Harris and Maria Bello. Directed by David Cronenberg. (R. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) But for director David Cronenberg and the commitment of his actors ""A History of Violence"" might have been a cartoony action film. Its origins are in a cartoon of sorts -- specifically in a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke . But although the movie maintains and benefits from the bare bones of a straight-up action story what emerges onscreen is deeper and more interesting. ""A History of Violence"" is a psychological thriller and in its own idiosyncratic way a rumination on character. Theres not a wasted moment. Yet the pace is measured. Every character gets his due every environment feels lived in and every bit of story information comes grounded in detail about character and relationships. Cronenberg presses the movie forward which in this case is not synonymous with simply advancing the story. Cronenberg is also advancing not an idea so much as an impression of violence as something hovering over virtually all human interaction like the air people breathe. Its not always there but it always might be there. It can make itself known at any moment. And of course Viggo Mortensen is ready for anything that might happen. Having slain a succession of monsters in the ""Lord of the Rings"" sagas Mortensen finds himself doing some of the same work as Tom the mild-mannered owner of a diner in small-town Indiana. Its a role that soon reveals itself as playing to Mortensens strengths -- his humility his forcefulness and a certain odd unknowable quality. Even before Tom proves himself a capable man when danger lurks theres something about Mortensen -- or is it something he does as an actor? -- that makes the audience think ""No. There has to be more to this guy."" Maybe its the sex scene between Tom and his wife (Maria Bello) that makes us respect him in advance. Early in the film Tom and his wife have a merry romp in bed that goes to the edge of the R rating. Once again Bello who was the girlfriend of William H. Macy in ""The Cooler"" is lucky with her screen lover. As far as guys in movies go this husband is attentive and enthusiastic. The scene establishes the bond between Mr. and the Mrs. which like the sex is not corny. It has some edges to it. Then destiny arrives one night in the form of two murderous drifters who walk into Toms diner at closing time intent on starting trouble. They dont just want to rob the place. Tom makes the calculation (which Mortensen lets us see) They want to kill people. And so Tom does what anybody would do in that situation and ends up a hero with his story talked up on the national cable news networks. Thats all great until some gangsters in Philadelphia see those news stories and show up the next day in Indiana. They think Tom isnt Tom. They think hes some gangster named Joey who ran away from Philadelphia 20 years ago. Ed Harris plays the head gangster a man in a dark suit who rides around in a black Lincoln and who will not be persuaded not for one second that Tom isnt Joey. ""Joey youre trying so hard to be this other guy its really painful to watch"" he says. Its bad enough these gangsters think hes Joey but even worse they really dont like Joey. And Tom has nowhere to hide. As Hemingway knew when he wrote ""The Killers"" theres something really helpless about a man stuck behind a counter. From this platform Cronenberg builds the suspense the sense of everything converging and closing in. Parallels are drawn between Toms experiences and that of his son (Ashton Holmes) who is contending with bullies in school. The idea is that theres no relief and no shelter anywhere which is something Tom seems to understand intuitively. Its what makes him interesting and what makes the movie more than just a routine thriller. He knows violence from the inside out. Mortensen is the main attraction but this is everybodys show with Bello passionate and fierce as his wife and Harris exuding an eerie reasonableness as the gangster who cant be dissuaded. Also worth noting is William Hurt who is flamboyant in a featured role as yet another Philadelphia gangster who is well dressed and gregarious but in the best old-movie-gangster tradition fairly stupid. -- Advisory This film contains graphic simulated sex frontal nudity brutal violence gore and strong language.

"History of Violence A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; history-of-violence-a ) History of Violence A (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Note Although this review does not contain explicit spoilers careful reading may make it possible to discern plot points. Consider this a warning. David Cronenberg the director of such films as Dead Ringers and The Fly has a reputation for being a little ""out there."" It may come as a surprise therefore to learn that his latest A History of Violence is almost mainstream in the way it tells a linear story and curtails freaky images. The movie which is at its heart a meditation upon the meaning of identity is not perfect. Although theres little wrong with the first two-thirds A History of Violence slides onto a tangential path during its final act and this misstep reduces the productions overall effectiveness. Nevertheless theres a lot to admire here. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a model citizen ideal father and loving husband. His two children Jack (Ashton Holmes) and Sarah (Heidi Hayes) trust him and his wife Edie (Maria Bello) adores him. The fun hasnt gone out of their marriage as Edie proves when she dons a cheerleader outfit to seduce Tom. One evening while Tom is working behind the counter at his diner two thugs come in with rape and robbery on their minds. After a brief struggle Tom gets the gun away from one of the robbers and uses it to dispatch both intruders. He is hailed as a hero and there is blanket news coverage. And its on TV that Carl Fogaty (Ed Harris) sees a familiar face. Based on the evidence of his eyes the man who calls himself Tom Stall is actually Joey Cusack an ex-killer from Philadelphia. So with henchmen in tow Carl heads for the town of Millbrook Indiana. Central to the films success is the uncertainty about Toms past. When confronted by Carl he not only denies being Joey but claims to have never been in Philadelphia. Neither the script nor Viggo Mortensen gives us a clue whether Tom and Joey are the same person or whether Tom is the victim of an unfortunate coincidence. As the Stalls must deal with the new dangerous presence in their life they must grapple with questions of identity. What makes each of us who we are? Is it our face or something deep within? Cronenberg weaves a spell for over an hour but he proves unable to sustain it for the entire running length. The need for a conventional resolution pulls him off course during the movies final third. Some of the most interesting characters and relationships are taken off the screen to allow A History of Violence to move in a different direction. Since the screenplay is based on a graphic novel I suspect that the filmmakers may have had little choice about the trajectory. The children have their own mini-stories as well. Sarah is afraid of monsters in her closet and is comforted by her father (who says there are no monsters) and brother (who asserts that monsters are afraid of the light). Meanwhile Jack has problems with a school bully. At first he backs down but in the wake of his fathers ""heroic"" actions at the diner he decides that confrontation may be the better course of action. Has the wimp become an avenger? Once again it comes back to a question of identity. Mortensen finds the perfect pitch for Tom. In this performance we see a good simple man who cares about his family and community. But we also see hints of something else - a darker more decisive personality. During the films first hour I changed my mind several times about whether Tom was Joey and a lot of that had to do with the way Mortensen plays the role. Opposite him Maria Bello is a firecracker the kind of actress who draws the cameras attention. Not since The Cooler has she been given this juicy and demanding a part. And as the villain Ed Harris is nothing short of despicable. A History of Violence can be seen as a thriller but in many ways it works best during its quieter moments. As the title indicates this is not a sedate art film. It contains moments of sharp vicious mayhem and there is a body count. But the strength of the movie lies in its psychological complexity and depth. And while I wasnt enthused about where A History of Violence takes the audience during its waning moments it at least offers a sense of closure and in the final scene hope. Left unresolved however is the perhaps unanswerable question about whether the nature and identity of a person are fixed or fluid.

"David Cronenberg stirs up danger in A History of Violence - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW David Cronenberg stirs up danger in A History of Violence By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 23 2005 For more than 25 years Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg has been making movies about mans fatal attraction to the extreme -- be it electronic (Videodrome"") scientific (The Fly"") medical (Dead Ringers"") transgender (M. Butterfly"") narcotic (Naked Lunch"") erotic (Crash"") virtual (eXistenZ"") or psychological (Spider""). His latest movie A History of Violence"" is something of a change-up. A mild-mannered small-town fellow is accused of having gone to grisly extremes in the past.The film has the perverse intelligence of Cronenbergs other movies. Its not his best but it is certainly his most accessible least stagy work obeying the laws of chronology and serving up characters whom we recognize as people. The movies brilliance resides in its use of cinematic convention to shatter an illusion of social normalcy.The Stalls whose home is perched on a handsome plot of land in Millbrook Ind. are an average Middle-American clan untroubled and happy. The adults Tom (Viggo Mortensen) and Edie (Maria Bello) are still wildly attracted to each other and the teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes) gets along great with Mom and Dad despite his pot smoking and woes at school.The familys placid state is broken after two men show up at the diner Tom owns just as its about to close for the night. They try to rob the place but in a nimbly choreographed sequence Tom turns from his neighborly self into an efficient defenseman killing his assailants and becoming a celebrity in the process.But the heroic glow brings out the strangest things in the Stalls. Jack for one doesnt merely stand up to the school bully the day after his fathers incident he bludgeons him. The sweet kid turns into a rebellious teen who would put a scare into any punk on the WB.Soon an unwanted visitor played with hammy malice by Ed Harris dressed in a black suit slithers out of the woodwork and into the diner. He insinuates that our hero is actually someone named Joey. Tom is baffled. Edie is outraged. And A History of Violence"" starts looking like a noirish action movie reframed within the contours of a Western.This is a hard film to be more detailed about because Cronenberg has so richly booby-trapped his question of whether Tom is or was a killing machine. Needless to say Harriss character and his impossible accusation spark a note of disharmony in the Stall household that had probably been roiling just beneath the surface all along.A History of Violence"" has been adapted by Josh Olson from a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke and Cronenberg seems to have attempted to duplicate the deliberate flat dimensions of a comic book. The early first scenes of the picture often seem like a gravely serious cartoon which ironically frees the movie to be funny though without ever feeling frivolous. In fact the films equilibrium is poised on a line between comedy and peril a precarious balance best demonstrated in the contrast of two sex scenes between Tom and Edie.One happens before Harris shows up Edie puts on a cheerleaders costume and pretends to be in her girlhood bedroom with her parents just down the hall. The other happens after. Both are funny but the second one is charged with the animal danger that the initial tryst used as an erotic fantasy.Not all the subversions hang together. The film feels disjointed particularly toward the end but afterward it blooms in the memory. The tone deepens as the story develops in much the same way that the exuberant cheapness in the first half of David Lynchs Mulholland Drive"" turns out to be an elaborate hoax. Cronenberg is not toying with us as Lynch was; instead hes challenging us.People showing up for a Viggo Mortensen action vehicle will be bummed at how commercially abnormal A History of Violence"" is. Its an essay about human nature and the struggle against it. The film is also intensely curious about what movie violence means for the characters provoked to engage in it. Yet Cronenberg likes movies too much for this one to be an anti-entertainment deconstruction of them.The bone crushing and shootouts supply the visceral kick theyre supposed to. The sex is hot. The menace is palpable. And the performances of Mortensen Bello and Holmes are excellent. In other words A History of Violence"" is a real-life movie with disturbing dramatic implications. The impossibly happy family that sat around the breakfast table at the start of the picture is drastically altered come the supper at the end. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

The movie is even told in flashback framed by a letter Dick writes to his ladylove. Only Wendy is no ordinary gal Shes a double-action pearl-handled revolver with an internal hammer -- an admittedly obscure object of desire for a committed pacifist whos been deemed too ""sensitive"" for a job in the local coal mine. But Dick cant deny that having Wendy in his pocket infuses him with a newfound self-confidence -- it makes him walk taller. He even forms a secret gun-appreciation society called the Dandies and populates it with other town ""losers"" and misfits including Huey (Chris Owen) a young man in leg braces; his brother Freddie (Michael Angarano) whos forever being teased and beaten up over Hueys disability; Susan (Alison Pill) a wicked good shot who will eventually come to compete with Wendy for Dicks affections; and Sebastian (Danso Gordon) the delinquent son of the Dandelions live-in maid. Theres just one catch to being a Dandy Members may admire but never use their coveted weapons -- at least outside of the makeshift firing range theyve created inside of an abandoned mine shaft. The Dandies are stand-ins for the millions of self-proclaimed ""peace-loving Americans"" who own guns only for ""protection."" Protection from what exactly? Why other people with guns of course. Its a self-fulfilling prophecy fueled by the culture of media-fed fear -- the one that makes airline passengers skittish around any man in a turban makes Angelenos petrified to drive south of the 10 freeway and in Dear Wendy expresses itself in the form of a ""gang problem"" that has the denizens of fair Estherslope running scared despite the lack of any hard evidence that such a problem exists. So it is not long into the film before protection gives way to paranoia -- before the constant talk of gang violence wills just such a thing into being -- and we witness a vivid illustration of that age-old conventional wisdom Where therere guns theyll fire.It will surprise few to learn that Dear Wendy which was directed by Danish director Thomas Vinterberg (The Celebration) was written by Vinterbergs countryman Lars von Trier whose own Dogville explored the latent cruelty beneath the placid surface of another provincial American mining town and whose forthcoming Manderlay (which premiered this year at Cannes) is about an Alabama plantation where slavery is still in effect some 70 years after abolition. Dear Wendy isnt as overtly allegorical as those two pictures -- for starters its sets consist of more than chalk outlines. The mere presence of Triers name on a movie though is more than enough to rankle those critics and pundits who object to his bottomless desire to comment on the mores of a country upon whose soil he has never set foot. Vinterberg for his part has been to America many times -- Ive even seen him here with my own eyes twice -- yet as with Trier a certain cautious distance is key to his vision of our country. That is America as it is perceived on foreign shores compressed into television images and bounced between far-flung satellites. Which for Trier and Vinterberg is a country that shoots first and asks questions later. And there has perhaps been no time in our recent history when we have been in greater need of just such a perspective. Dear Wendy starts out as an inspired test case for the continued necessity of the Second Amendment and only near the end does it lose some of its tightly concentrated focus. The movie builds toward a standoff between the Dandies and the Estherslope authorities (including Bill Pullman as a kindly sheriff) that carries strong echoes of Waco and Ruby Ridge. But Trier and Vinterberg have the Dandies act more aggressively than the victims did in those earlier sieges muddying the ideological waters in a way that Dear Wendy doesnt have time to contend with before the end credits roll. In another gunpowder-tinged romance arriving in local theaters on the same day the metaphor is both more precise and more fully sustained. From its opening images of pickup trucks and painted wood barns goldenrod wheat fields and vast horizons of green A History of Violence invokes a heightened comic-lyric vision of the American ""heartland."" Its a corn-fed Midwestern reverie about a place where family dinners remain sacred rituals clean-cut farm boys marry their high school sweethearts and good honest men work to support well-adjusted nuclear families. Set to the strains of composer Howard Shores stirring Coplandesque fanfares it seems the America of Norman Rockwell and Quaker Oats commercials yet already it is not. For while A History of Violence is set in Millbrook Indiana it was filmed entirely in Millbrook Ontario by the Canadian director David Cronenberg. And that is but the first of many ways in which this movie ruptures our fantasies. A History of Violence which was written by Josh Olson takes its cue from a tradition of films -- Hitchcocks Shadow of a Doubt Nicholas Rays Bigger Than Life and David Lynchs Blue Velvet among them -- that use the iconography of the American Dream to lead us toward an American nightmare. It begins when local diner owner Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) shoots two men dead during an attempted robbery. The lives of customers and co-workers are saved and local newspapers and magazines celebrate Tom as a hero. Even his own family -- his wife Edie (Maria Bello) son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes) -- look at him differently after the incident with awe in their eyes; Edie seems downright turned on by the whole thing. Then some men in dark suits sunglasses and tinted cars show up in Toms diner acting like they know him. They say that his name isnt Tom Stall but Joey Cusack and that hes the brother of a fearsome Philadelphia gangster (William Hurt). They even say that once upon a time Joey was a pretty scary guy himself.The studio that produced A History of Violence has asked journalists not to reveal any of the movies ""dramatic plot twists"" -- in other words were not supposed to reveal whether Tom Stalls case is one of mistaken identity or something more sinister. In fact Cronenbergs movie renders the answer to that question all but irrelevant because in the moment Tom Stall squeezes that trigger he becomes Joey Cusack in a way regardless of whether he ever was Joey Cusack before. In taking another life -- two lives -- Tom feels a rush of godlike power and for a moment or maybe more than a moment he likes it. Indeed Cronenberg suggests we might all have a Joey buried somewhere inside us waiting to be loosed from his lamp.A History of Violence is like so many Cronenbergs before it (The Brood The Fly Dead Ringers) a study in transference and transmutation no matter those who have pinned it as an atypical effort. It is also something more -- a movie that sees as perhaps only someone on the outside looking in can how large notions of vigilantism and self-preservation loom in the American consciousness as if the Confederacy had ended but five minutes ago and cowboys still roamed the wild western ranges. It would be easy to condemn us for that I suppose but Cronenberg doesnt and its actually possible to imagine the film playing as an action crowd-pleaser to a mainstream genre audience that may not be a bit perturbed by (or even aware of) Cronenbergs stealthy unraveling of the threads of this American life. He holds up a mirror but he leaves it up to us to recoil at what we see.

Apart from some effective detail work with classical American cinema archetypes that makes parts of it play like a modern-day Western ""A History of Violence"" is a surprisingly conventional film from the normally more adventurously mind-bending David Cronenberg. A tale of a prototypically normal Middle American family put to the test by crime and a disruption of its very identity pic is dominated by familiar themes hyped by an extra dash of hot sex and graphic violence. But lack of depth complexity or strangeness make this a relatively routine entry for the director indicating moderate B.O. prospects for New Line upon planned Sept. 30 release after fest rounds. Adapted by Josh Olson from a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke ""Violence"" reminds of another film with a similar source ""Road to Perdition"" due to the central role of Irish-American gangsters. Buffs may also find elements of ""Out of the Past"" ""Straw Dogs"" ""The Big Heat"" and countless sagebrush dramas in the story and its treatment. Westerns are most certainly drawn to mind by the impressive long opening take which shows two bad guys (Stephen McHattie and Greg Bryk) emerging from a motel and speaking in the most taciturn manner about their plans. Leaving three dead bodies in their wake the two take off for their next destination. This happens to be Millbrook Ind. a warm picture perfect burg where great-looking couple Tom and Edie Stall (Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello) live with their high school-age son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and little daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). First scene that doesnt ring quite right is one in which Jack is hassled by a jerky jock for having made a routine catch of a fly ball the jock hit in a gym class baseball game. What did the bully expect him to do drop the ball on purpose? That Tom and Edie still have the hots for one another is friskily demonstrated in a raunchy scene in which they play teenager with Edie donning a cheerleaders outfit as a preliminary. But life as they know it comes to an end with the arrival of the baddies. Entering the diner Tom runs one guy pulls out a gun while the other begins to rough up a waitress. Thinking fast Tom tosses a hot coffee pot on the first man grabs his gun and shoots both of them while sustaining just a stab in the foot himself. Tom is turned into a local hero something this modest man of few words disdains. ""Are you as sick of hearing about me as I am?"" he asks his wife after seeing his mug all over TV. But it turns out Tom may have reasons of his own for not wanting any publicity. A city slicker who talks thuggish and has one bad eye and heavy facial scars Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shortly turns up with two goons at the diner and starts talking to Tom as if he knows him calling him by the name Joey Cusack and reminding him of the old days in Philly. Tom says hes not named Joey and has never been to Philly but Carl continues to dog the family following Edie and her daughter to a mall and finally showing up at the Stalls remote home to insist that Tom come with him. How this gets resolved out-does the diner scene in surprising violence and turns the rest of the film down a track that deals although not in particularly interesting ways with identity and family rifts and leads to yet one more major and bloody stand-off. Without knowing who made the film one could say its a very well crafted slightly idiosyncratic look at some traditional American themes regarding the sanctity of family and the undercurrents beneath the surface people dont often like to disturb. But coming from Cronenberg the question arises Is that all there is? Theres just not that much going on here and what there is seems relatively ordinary both on the domestic and gangster fronts. Mortensen is solid and Gary Cooperish without revealing a great deal while Bello goes considerably further to make tangible the love and the anguish Edie experiences. Harris and William Hurt the latter as a mobster who turns up late in the proceedings come out firing on all cylinders in very juicy turns. Shot as it happens in Millbrook Ontario Canada but looking for all the world like a south-of-the-border town pic is well appointed in all departments except for the somewhat too insistent score by Howard Shore.
