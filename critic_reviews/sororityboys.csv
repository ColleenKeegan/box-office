Hardly as inspired as either of those ancestors this Touchstone presentation nonetheless is a cut above most youth-skewed sex comedies of late with bouncy execution and an unsophisticated but positive gender-sensitivity message. ""Animal House"" meets ""Some Like It Hot"" in the genial cross-dressing teenpic ""Sorority Boys."" Hardly as inspired as either of those ancestors this Touchstone presentation nonetheless is a cut above most youth-skewed sex comedies of late with bouncy execution and an unsophisticated but positive gender-sensitivity message elevating a so-so script. Same basic mix (plus a must-see lead perf which this ensembler lacks) propelled ""Legally Blonde"" to sleeper status last year and ""Boys"" stands a fair chance of similarly performing beyond current genre expectations. Sophomore feature for director Wally Wolodarsky (a veteran writing contributor to ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Tracey Ullman Show"") is much broader stuff than his 1995 debut the unjustly overlooked black comedy ""Coldblooded."" Yet while co-scenarists Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge never quite come up with the home-run gags or situations pic promises they keep simple plot running nicely while Wolodarskys pacing and production packaging provide steady light diversion. Protags Dave (Barry Watson from WB serial ""7th Heaven"") Adam (Michael Rosenbaum of same nets ""Smallville"") and Doofer (Harland Williams of ""Freddy Got Fingered"") constitute the social committee of a generic universitys most notoriously party-monstrous frat house KOK. Thus theyre in charge of its cash resources and when coin goes missing theyre ousted -- even though accusing frat prez Spence (Brad Beyer doing a decent Will Ferrell impression) is pretty obviously the real culprit. A scheme to infiltrate the frats kegger in drag and seize name-clearing evidence goes sour when the bewigged trio becomes the brunt of a typical KOK sexist prank -- theyre netted by ""dog-catching"" brothers then hurled to the pavement outside. This humiliation attracts notice of Leah (Melissa Sagemiller) budding-feminist leader of the Delta Omicron Gamma sorority next door. She takes them in and with nowhere else to go until justice prevails the three lads -- possibly screens least convincing screen cross-dressers since Lemmon and Curtis -- must settle in with their fellow DOG (ka-boom-cha) pledges for a crash course in misfit sisterhood. Resulting nuance-free exploration of everywoman problems in a man-boys world soon has Adam (now Adina) fretting over body-fat issues while fighting off the advances of desperately horny KOK frosh Jimmy (Tony Denman). Doofer-Roberta becomes a booster for DOG girls low self esteem with a little help from hempsville. The cutest in or out of drag Dave (nee Daisy) tries wooing lovely Leah in pants but to his surprise finds he gets further on the Sapphic track. Pic flirts with parodying ancient campus-comedy conventions and could have used a little more absurdist oomph in that department a la last years uneven ""Wet Hot American Summer."" Stabs at gross-out humor in the ""American Pie"" vein involving sperm stains dildoes etc. are unmemorable though frisky enough (alongside some brief nudity) to warrant pics R rating. Likewise successive climactic set pieces -- first one intercutting among three separate cross-dress intrigues the next a touch-football match against the colleges ""bimbo"" sorority lastly a cruise-ferry party melee -- arent so much outstanding in their comic invention as colorfully and amusingly staged. Cast is game enough with closest thing to a standout perf coming from ""Welcome to the Dollhouses"" Heather Matarazzo as a screechy-voiced DOG in need of confidence lessons. Production is nicely turned out visually thanks to lenser Michael D. OShea Edward T. McAvoys production design and Melinda Eshelmans slightly camp costuming. One-time Devo-tee Mark Mothersbaugh contributes backing score alongside music supervisor Randall Posters savvy lineup of soundtracked pop oldies.

Left to right Harland Williams Barry Watson and Michael Rosenbaum in Sorority Boys. Photo HANDOUT Sisterhood is powerful / Sorority earns big laughs with gags lifted from other drag comedies 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SORORITY BOYS Comedy. Starring Barry Watson Michael Rosenbaum Harland Williams Melissa Sagemiller. Directed by Wally Wolodarsky. Written by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Sorority Boys"" shamelessly rips off ""Tootsie"" ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" and every other movie where the men dress in drag. But this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative. Its no surprise director Wally Wolodarsky once wrote for ""The Simpsons"" because hes crafted a movie a cut above the rest of the teen comedy genre. The sight of three butch guys in womens wear is inherently funny. But ""Sorority Boys"" also benefits from its stellar cast of young actors. Barry Watson from TVs ""7th Heaven"" is the pretty one Michael Rosenbaum from ""Smallville"" the spunky one and Harland Williams (""Superstar"") the matronly ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" type. Their characters are expelled from their fraternity on dubious charges. Or something like that -- the plots just an excuse to get them into womens clothes and into a sorority of oddballs so hard up for members that they offer the newcomers free board. That these women believe for one second that these guys are female is part of the joke. So is a sorority sister asking one of the new ""girls"" to help her wash her hair in the shower. The script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge has just the right tone taking every contrivance from every guy-in-a-dress movie and distilling them into an ironclad comedy concept with no relationship to reality only to previous films. ""Sorority Boys"" differs from its forebears however in how it portrays the mens transformation. Instead of trying to get laughs from their plucking waxing or struggling into pantyhose the men show up fully transformed. The humor comes from their trying and failing to act natural in womens clothes. One hilarious sequence features overhead shots of the guys sleeping with their legs splayed or spread-eagled and straining at their nighties. Costume designer Melissa Eshelman contributes half of the movies laughs especially when she puts Williams in denim jumpers and ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" ringlets. The prostitute chic sported by Rosenbaum is also divine. Rosenbaum a knockout comic actor brings broad-shouldered grit to his characters struggles with high heels and with the way his butt looks in a tight skirt. The fake girls dont get to have all the fun. Their sorority sisters face off against a snooty rival sorority in a rollicking ""powder puff"" football game where the most awkward girls get to shine. Melissa Sagemiller (""Get Over It"") is an appealing presence as the head of the sorority a feminist who doesnt know that her new ""sisters"" come from the misogynist house across the way. Sagemiller is sweet to Watson when hes a woman. But she rebuffs him when as a guy he tries to scam on her in her womens studies class as the instructor lectures about ""the myth of the male orgasm."" Their relationship mirrors the Jessica Lange-Dustin Hoffman scenes of ""Tootsie"" nearly shot for shot with a few intriguing twists. Unlike most people making broad comedies these days director Wolodarsky and the films writers know how to use gross-out humor judiciously. While piling on the vulgar stuff gets easy laughs a single sling-shotted dildo can go a long way. . This film contains raw language sexual situations.

Updating ""National Lampoons Animal House"" behavior to fit the WB generation Sorority Boys adds that it helps to spend time in a womans dorm too. Barry Watson (""7th Heaven"") Michael Rosenbaum (""Smallville"") and acquired-taste comedian Harland Williams gaily star as frat brothers from Kappa Omega Kappa (KOK duh) who infiltrate loser sorority Delta Omicron Gamma (DOG double duh) in a complicated scheme the point of which doesnt matter. What does matter is that amid all the fake-boob adjusting (and despite the wan romantic subplot between Watson and Melissa Sagemiller as DOGhouse leader) there are moments of real funniness in this smarter-than-anticipated goof-fest. As directed by Wally Wolodarsky - one of the original writers of The Simpsons - from a script by first-timers Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge ""Sorority Boys"" is suitably raunchy but unexpectedly generous. And if you think thats easy check out ""Slackers"" or ""Tomcats."" Myself Im partial to the charms of a French sorority sister (Yvonne Scio) with mustache and full-tufted armpits who smokes while brushing her teeth. But others will appreciate the cameos by ""Animal House""-mates Mark Metcalf James Daughton and Stephen Furst as alumni dads and John Vernon - Dean Wormer - as a really old dude.
