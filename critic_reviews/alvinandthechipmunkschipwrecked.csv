Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Alvin And The Chipmunks trilogy seems to take special glee in sacrificing David Cross dignity. Alvin And The Chipmunks The Squeakquel found the Mr. Show co-creator rummaging around in a Dumpster playing a disgraced record executive who pays dearly for trying to exploit the Chipmunks. The humiliation continues with Alvin And The Chipmunks Chipwrecked which ropes Cross into the proceedings under the flimsiest of pretenses--hes so washed up in the record industry the only job he can get is as an entertainer on a cruise ship--then requires him to spend nearly the entire film in a grubby pelican costume. It is not a role overly conducive to the preservation of dignity or self-respect. Then again what in Chipwrecked is? Sporting a default look of weary resignation Jason Lee returns as the caretaker of rodent superstars Alvin And The Chipmunks and their distaff counterparts The Chipettes. Chipwrecked finds Lee escorting the Chipmunks and Chipettes to an international awards show via a luxury cruise ship but before the gala event can occur the musical rodents with the unbearably squeaky voices are ship-wrecked on a remote island with only a mysterious castaway (the charmingly daft Jenny Slate) for company. On the island Simon trades in his dreary old persona for a dashing new French alter-ego after getting bitten by a spider and Alvin loses his rock-star mojo after his brothers flashy new persona wows everyone but Chipwrecked functions primarily as a bright flashy delivery system for sped-up covers of pop hits from the past few decades including a Chipette version of the Lady Gaga queer anthem ""Born This Way."" Even by the exceedingly lenient standards of second sequels to terrible kids films Chipwrecked feels particularly arbitrary and devoid of inspiration. It all but apologizes for its ridiculous mercenary existence with a running time well under 90 minutes and rapid-fire pacing that hurries the little ones out the door as quickly as possible so they can get on with their day. With its wall-to-wall pop covers Chipwrecked isnt a kids movie so much as a brightly animated instantly forgettable animated feature-length advertisement for the NOW Thats What I Call Music compilation series of contemporary pop hits.

On a cruise-ship vacation Alvin (Justin Long) brothers Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) and their female doppelgangers the Chipettes become stranded on a deserted island prompting not alas a to-the-death Lord of the Flies scenario but instead merely a perfunctory rescue mission from paternal owner Dave (Jason Lee) and bird-costumed former nemesis Ian (David Cross). In the wild Alvin embraces responsibility and Simon (transformed by a head-conk into dashing alter ego Simon) becomes carefree and confident. Nonetheless theres barely a narrative to speak of in director Mike Mitchells slapstick-y adventure which is mainly concerned with haphazard movie references (The Lord of the Rings Castaway) and grating Chipmunk-ized renditions of hits by among others Willow Smith and Destinys Child. Smushing together Katy Perrys ""Firework"" and Lady Gagas ""Born This Way"" in a tossed-off finale would be more egregious if it--like a fittingly lame nod to the ""Double Rainbow"" viral video--didnt perfectly epitomize Chipwreckeds unimaginative pandering to contemporary top 40 and pop-culture fads.

JENNIE PUNTER The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 16 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English It all began with The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Dont Be Late) the hit novelty single written and recorded by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. in 1958 that sold millions and won three Grammy awards. While the song has endured Alvin and The Chipmunks and the female trio The Chipettes (created in 1983) have been gathering more ""nuts"" (nominations and awards for recordings TV shows specials etc.) and most recently chewing up the scenery in three live action-CGI family films. Screen grab from the online trailer for the animated feature ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chip-Wrecked"" Movies Alvin and the Chipmunks Chip-Wrecked The official trailer A scene from Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked. Film Video Chipmunks not just for kids Jason Lee says Chip-Wrecked follows the highly annoying (for grown-ups) yet astoundingly successful kid-targeted features Alvin and The Chipmunks (2007) and The Squeakquel (2009) continuing the misadventures of the rambunctious helium-voiced singing and dancing rodents and their manager-surrogate father Dave Seville (Jason Lee) as they board a luxury liner for some much needed Ramp;R before a major international pop music event. Like the recent Adam Sandler dud Jack and Jill a sizable chunk of Chip-Wrecked was shot on the newest ship in the fleet of a major cruise company - the ultimate in movie product placement Writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (the Kung Fu Panda movies and previous Chipmunks flicks) trot out tired shipboard gags with the rebellious Alvin (Justin Long) wreaking havoc and the Chipettes wiggling their tails in a salsa smackdown against a trio of Jersey Shore-esque female passengers. Mike Mitchell who directed Shrek Forever After is on cruise control here - the smart move when youre at the helm of a massive pop culture franchise with many vested interests. The comedic talents of Lee (star of TVs My Name Is Earl and a Kevin Smith movie vet) are pretty much unexploited in Chip-Wrecked. Same goes for those of David Cross ( Arrested Development) reprising his role as the Chipmunks nemesis Ian Hawke a former music exec now slumming it as the ships mascot and wearing his worn-out yellow bird costume at all times. The hang glider Hawke swoops around in is put to use after Alvin commandeers a kite and accidentally heads out to sea with the Chipmunks and Chipettes clinging to the tail - the kites tail that is. They find refuge on a deserted tropical island where there are not nearly enough coconut jokes. David and Ian who has made no secret of his desire for revenge soar after them wash up on the same island and begin searching for chipmunk tracks. Simon - the brainy shy chipmunk - accidentally gets a hit of local venom that changes him into a daring romantic who inexplicably starts speaking with a French accent. Very not funny. The chipmunks soon run into the loopy Zoe (SNL featured performer Jenny Slate) a treasure-seeking castaway who introduces them to the ""others"" a collection of various sports balls with drawn-on faces. The obvious nods to Castaway Lost and other pop culture references are barely worth a grin. When the islands active volcano starts to rumble humans and chipmunks must put aside their differences and save each other before they all get roasted like so many Christmas chestnuts. Full of squeaky-voiced renditions of dozens of old and recent hit songs Chip-Wrecked will entertain youngsters - at least those not frightened of exploding mountains and weird adults --but grownups will find themselves wishing these chipmunks had gone into deep winter hibernation instead of making another movie.

Its not only the cruise-ship setting but a blatant contempt for conventional narrative and American culture. (The opening shot is so shameless it ends up mocking Hollywood product placement.) Godard-style subtitles might actually make it possible to occasionally understand what the Chipmunks and the Chippettes are saying. Or possibly explain why human female lead Jenny Slate sometimes breaks into a random French accent while mugging her way through a sentence. By this point the movie has switched to channeling Luis Bunuels ""Robinson Crusoe -- that is if Bunuel had thought of throwing in references to ""Cast Away ""Top Hat and so help me ""Captain Corellis Mandolin along with the occasional rap number. Seriously you usually have to go to an Adam Sandler movie or the Quad Cinema to see something as incompetently made as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks. It really couldnt have been easy for Jason Lee (""Almost Famous) to keep a straight face while saying ""Im not in this for the money.

Starring Jason Lee David Cross Jenny Slate Justin Long Matthew Gray Gubler Jesse McCartney Amy Poehler Anna Faris Christina Applegate Director Mike Mitchell Running time 127 Release Opened Dec 16 2011  Editorial Review These rodents wont go awayBy Sean OConnellFriday Dec. 16 2011Lifes a beach for our CGI chipmunk pals as Alvin Simon and Theodore end up stranded on a deserted island when their cruise-ship vacation goes awry and . . . Im sorry is this really necessary? Lets be honest. Either youre eagerly anticipating ""Chipwrecked"" the third installment in the lucrative ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" series or youve opted to avoid these films like the plague. Nothing in this review will persuade a non-fan to unleash his or her inner munk and no opinion put forth could possibly dissuade the substantial ""Alvin"" audience - and I do mean substantial - from handing over hard-earned cash to learn which dated Lady Gaga hits the singing rodents cover next. At best I can tell you what to expect from ""Chipwrecked"" so youre not completely set adrift without a rudder. As usual Alvin (voiced by Justin Long) remains the chipmunks chief instigator while the three embark on an ocean-spanning trip with their beleaguered agent/parent Dave (Jason Lee). The mischievous critters latest prank gets his fuzzy mates - and their adorable female counterparts the Chipettes - tied up in a parasail that carries them off the starboard side of a cruise ship and onto a tropical island that they believe to be uninhabited. Faster than we can sing ""a three-hour tour"" screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger zigzag through musty ""Cast Away"" jokes stage a musical sequence to Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound Machines ancient dance number ""Rhythm Is Gonna Get You"" and establish a bizarre running joke that references Nicolas Cages 2001 weeper ""Captain Corellis Mandolin."" Were introduced to Zoe (Jenny Slate) a FedEx pilot who tells the chipmunks she has been stranded on the island for eight or nine years. (Hello Tom Hanks? Castaway? Anyone?) Just dont ask why her clothes are clean her hair is perfect and she hasnt run out of eye makeup. And sensible chipmunk Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) reveals a swashbuckling split personality named Simone (Alan Tudyk) after an indigenous spider injects him with neurotoxins. Side note Is it common knowledge that Long currently seen on Foxs ""New Girl"" opposite Zooey Deschanel voices Alvin? How about the fact that three comedic superstars lend their pipes to the Chipettes? That would be Amy Poehler Christina Applegate and Anna Faris - extremely gifted comedians who should have their pick of better projects. Their voices are indistinguishable when cranked up to squeaky chipmunk pitch. Why bother hiring them at all? But I digress. The ""Chipmunks"" have a very loyal audience - the previous two films crossed the 200 million mark at the box office which doesnt happen by accident - and ""Chipwrecked"" serves up more of the derivative chaos that floats this franchises boat. Fans will consider it an early Christmas present. Detractors will be happy to sing a different tune.Contains nothing objectionable.

Starring Jason Lee David Cross and the voices of Justin Long and Christina Applegate. Directed by Mike Mitchell. (PG. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The decision to set the third ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movie on a remote island seems like a potential gift for cynical parents - if nothing else because of the increased presence of predators. But alas these rodents - spoiler alert - survive for a fourth incarnation which no doubt will involve the introduction of a smaller cuter cousin. (Based on the template set by the Muppets we dont expect them to reach outer space until at least the fifth sequel.) The name of the movie is ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chip-Wrecked"" so at least you know what youre getting into from the start. Its an uninspired and instantly forgettable film. But it completely succeeds by its own standards an 87-minute rainy-day distraction that will probably make a zillion dollars. Related Stories Casting dispersions on Chipmunks castaways Review Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked The Chipmunks and their female counterparts the Chipettes return and so does Dave (Jason Lee) who was limited to a short cameo in the second movie. A cruise goes awry and all of the above end up shipwrecked on the Island of Dr. Cliche complete with a delusional castaway and an active volcano. Were not sure which ""Gilligans Island"" episode this movie borrows from the most. Call it a 98-way tie. Still the movie does have a certain calculated genius. The story is a jumbled mess - the plot of ""The Smurfs"" looks like ""The Usual Suspects"" by comparison - but there is something in this film for absolutely everyone. Lets go down the list Kids Plenty of slapstick. When one of the Chipmunks gets hit in the testicles he actually yells ""My acorns"" Teens Justification for bratty behavior. If anything it seems as if the chipmunks are rewarded for defying authority figures. Parents Seemingly random and mostly dated pop culture nods. During an early hang-gliding scene Alvin says ""I can see Russia from here"" Another chipmunk references the Dos Equis ""most interesting man in the world"" commercials. Carnival Cruise Lines An advertisement. With apologies to General Motors and ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" the ""Alvin""-Carnival tie-in is the most effective product placement weve seen this year. The second dimension For reasons that confound us the third Chipmunk movie is not in 3-D. Critics An opportunity to write smug vaguely self-congratulatory quips about the declining state of culture while ignoring the fact that the 1980s cartoon incarnation of ""Alvin"" was even worse. And with that Ill come to the point in the bad-kid-movie review where I applaud the efforts of the trendy cult actor in a supporting role. David Cross returns as the record executive who tried to enslave the Chipmunks. Cross is the rare actor who not only survives bad movies but actually becomes funnier when fleeing from a fake-looking erupting volcano. E-mail Peter Hartlaub at phartlaubsfchronicle.com.

With much more inventive family fare such as Hugo and Arthur Christmas also in theaters why would anyone attend another silly Chipmunks movie?In 2009s TheSqueakquel Alvin Theodore and Simon were joined by the Chipettes trio of Brittany Jeanette and Eleanor.

Credit 20th Century Fox There is chipmunk gambling. There is seductive dancing by Chipettes wearing only towels. There is a musical gag involving the lyric ""whip my tail back and forth."" How ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked"" ended up with only a G rating is a mystery.Alvin Theodore Simon and the gal pals they picked up earlier in the franchise are back and their human minder Dave (Jason Lee) comes up with the not-very-bright idea of taking them on a cruise. (The Carnival line gets perhaps the largest product placement in film history.)The whole gang ends up shipwrecked on a tropical island along with the nefarious Ian (David Cross who near the end delivers the films funniest speech) and lots of references to the Tom Hanks movie ""Cast Away"" that will elude the 5-year-olds in the audience.Also on the island is Jenny Slate (playing a character named Zoe) who may have been exiled there after using the worst possible swear word in her first show as a member of the ""Saturday Night Live"" cast in 2009. No swear words here; just harmless fun. A particularly nice touch Some of the munks change personalities as a result of a spider bite. Alvin the Responsible? Believe it.Noteworthy names provide some of the animated voices -- Justin Long Christina Applegate Amy Poehler -- though that money might have been better spent elsewhere. Once theyre run through the chip-erator these familiar voices are of course unrecognizable.

"Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked review Beyond rescue? - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ChipmunksAlvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked review Beyond rescue?The inspired silliness of previous Alvin and the Chipmunks films is missing from Chipwrecked where even the usually funny pop song covers are barely worth the squeaks.December 16 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic From left Jeanette Simon Brittany Alvin Eleanor and Theodore in ""Alvin... (20th Century Fox )With ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked"" I fear the furry singing sensations may have finally run completely aground. If only they were truly stranded on that desert islanda| Though the franchise has never been what youd call high art there was something of an inspired silliness to the live-action/CGI mash-up that began in 2007 with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks."" Sadly it seems that streak may have peaked with 2009s ""The Squeakquel."" Things have gone so far off track in ""Chipwrecked"" Im not sure a rescue is in the offing a unless of course the movie is another blockbuster hit in which case expect to see the boys back maybe putting on a Broadway musical this time (""Book of Alvin""?). All the usual suspects are back starting with Jason Lee as their adoptive dad Dave David Cross as the evil talent agent Ian and the two sometimes competing sometimes collaborating chipmunk packs (crews? posses?) a Alvin Simon and Theodore and the Chipettes Brittany Jeanette and Eleanor. Returning to give voice to the critters is some top tier comic talent including Justin Long Amy Poehler Anna Faris Christina Applegate and more. But their presence basically goes for naught with any identifying traits or emotional range lost in the helium squeak of that trademark chipmunk sound. This time the chaos starts with a family vacation for both Chipmunks and Chipettes a Carnival-styled cruise picked by Dave. It will come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the oeuvre that Alvin gets in trouble before the ship even leaves the port. Meanwhile Ians career has hit the skids and hes on board as the ships mascot a duck that looks eerily like those scuzzy plumped up chickens in Foster Farms ads. After some Alvin-inspired suntan oil slip-sliding on one of the decks the kids are pretty much under house arrest. Theres a lot of noise about Dave not letting go so the brat pack can grow up. Hes conflicted. He has reason to be. When he goes to smooth things over with the ships captain all havoc breaks loose. But weve been promised a Chipwreck and a hang-gliding incident finally makes it happen. Soon the Chipmunks are spelling out SOS with coconuts and hoping that Dave isnt so angry he wont come looking for them. Lee keeps Dave as bland as he ever was though if its possible he may have made the classic Chipmunk yell a ""Alvinnnnn"" a even more annoying. Meanwhile Ian who has been such a good snake in the grass has essentially been defanged. The new fly in the ointment is Zoe (Jenny Slate) whos been stranded on the island for years. A big fan of talking over her issues with volleyballs and other sporting goods A  la ""Castaway"" she does seem crazy but not enough to create that sense of dread the movie needs. The story from screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger who wrote the far better ""Squeakquel"" has some really serious themes running through it about growing up finding yourself facing your fears to name just a few. Try as they might though the Chipmunks never give the serious stuff the necessary bite. The real tragedy is the music. One of signatures of the Chipmunks from the beginning back in the late 50s and the few real pleasures of these films has been the ridiculously funny covers of top pop songs with their version of BeyoncA(c)s ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"" in ""Squeakquel"" a classic. In ""Chipwrecked"" Lady Gagas ""Bad Romance"" and ""Born This Way"" were supposed to be the moneymakers. But when the Chipmunks take them on the Gaga is gone and it all sounds terribly tame. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie attendance falls to 16-year lowJanuary 3 2012Movie Projector Mission Impossible to ring in 2012 at...December 30 2011Chipmunks creative team keeps adults in mindDecember 19 2011Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked infoDecember 16 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTChipmunksCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-chipwrecked-20111216,0,4303680.story?track=rss",200,alvinandthechipmunkschipwrecked8,alvinandthechipmunkschipwrecked,latimes

Bad news Theyve brought us along. In their third big-screen adventure the gang--which now includes three harmonizing chipmunks three dance-happy Chipettes and their harried father figure (Jason Lee)--tries for a relaxing cruise and ends up scavenging for mangoes alongside a brain-fried castaway (SNL vet Jenny Slate). At rare moments you get the impression that some of the people involved in the movie actually put thought into their work. The Chipmunks pop song covers are meticulously arranged. Their fur is animated with care. Then Alvin makes a tween-baiting ""honey badger"" reference or slips into an ill-advised impersonation of a Latino thug (no really) and Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked reverts to nothing more than a cynical stab at grabbing kids attention--and more importantly their parents cash.

You know there is something wrong with a movie when even David Cross in a giant pelican suit isnt funny.Of course the younguns attending an advance screening of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked last week still enjoyed themselves loudly. But to grown-up eyes (and by that we mean anyone over age 9) the third film in the current series looks like a rote uninspired commercial product. The little ones laughed and cheered the Chipmunks acrobatic antics but theres not one plot twist or even a Cross one-liner that comes as a surprise. Even parents who can handle the characters squeaky voices may want to bring a book and wait for the kids in the lobby.""Chipwrecked is directed by Mike Mitchell (""Shrek Forever After) with a screenplay by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger veterans of both the ""Chipmunks and ""Kung Fu Panda franchises. Actor Jason Lee once again cashes a paycheck playing Dave guardian to the famous singing chipmunks Alvin Simon and Theodore and to ""Chipettes Eleanor Jeanette and Brittany. As the movie opens they all board a cruise ship en route to a big music-awards show where the munks will perform. Also on board is the groups resentful former manager Ian (the aforementioned Cross) now reduced to working as the ships feathered mascot.Due to one of rambunctious Alvins hijinks-gone-wrong Dave Ian and the Chipmunks end up stranded on a tropical island. Of course there is a volcano a lost treasure and a log bridge across a deep gorge. Jenny Slate (""Bored to Death) plays a longtime castaway on the island and shes just nutso enough to make you want to see her in a better movie.During their island adventures Alvin and the other chipmunks learn responsibility and Dave learns to give them a little more of it. Its a decent lesson for children. And thats what the Chipmunks are here surrogates for their audience enacting their fears and crushes and dreams of musical stardom. Dave even calls them ""kids sometimes.Alas the three male munks get more active roles than the appearance-minded Chipettes. And the movie goes astray in the message department with a shipboard nightclub scene that finds Eleanor Jeanette and Brittany in a dance-floor throwdown with three mean girls. For a few minutes there the movie turns into ""Jersey Shore with (more) fur. But if you have been waiting for the chance to see six computer-animated chipmunks squeak out a Lady Gaga cover this is the film for you.Those squeaky voices by the way are provided by Justin Long Matthew Gray Gubler Jesse McCartney Amy Poehler Anna Faris and Christina Applegate. Whatever character they bring to their lines the actors voices are mostly unrecognizable after being digitally munk-ified. Joel Brown can be reached at jbnbptgmail.com.

Director Mike Mitchell. (127). G Wacky peril. At area theaters. Either the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies are getting better or Ive accidentally buried my brain for the winter. The third entry in the franchise -- ""Chip-Wrecked"" -- is dare I say the charm. The filmmakers have slowed down the chitter-chatter cut some of the incessant pop-culture riffs that went over the heads of its young audience and minimized the inane musical numbers. The result does right by kids. While on a cruise ship Alvin Simon and Theodore along with the Chipettes --- Eleanor Jeanette and Brittany -- accidentally hitch a ride on a kite. They land on an island where they have to fend for their furry selves and in Alvins case learn to grow up a little. Theres a survivalist on the island (a fun and silly Jenny Slate) who talks to a variety of sports balls a la Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away."" Shes an adventuress looking for a treasure and thinks the munks might be able to help. Meanwhile Dave (Jason Lee) and obnoxious Ian (David Cross) -- in a seagull outfit -- follow the chipmunks and wind up learning something too. Cross whose parallel career as a kids-film staple may have reached its zenith here is very funny and Lee has more to do than just look flustered. The Chippy voice performances are unrecognizable (Justin Long Amy Poehler Anna Faris and Christina Applegate are again among them) but the animation is more precise than in the original or in the dreadful ""Squeakquel."" Down at their level we can see some expressions and yes appreciate their dilemmas. Director Mike Mitchell who also made ""Shrek Forever After"" -- also the best film in that franchise -- respects his audience who are obviously relating more to the Chipmunks and Chipettes than the exasperated parent figures. But both groups can ease into ""Chip-Wrecked"" without having to squirrel away their brain cells. MAGIC MOMENT Dave uses Ian as a flotation device while swimming toward the island.

Fair Director Mike Mitchell. Cast Jason Lee David Cross voices of Justin Long and Christina Applegate. Rating G. ""AWK-ward"" ""Winning"" ""My Precious"" The sequels target audience may be too young to realize that the best punch lines are long past their expiration date but at least theyre learning the idea of the catchphrase. They can hear the exclamation points. Similarly even though they cant trace the visual evolution of the cinematic tropes -- the post-""Matrix"" slo-mo the vertical reverse zoom as a character looks up into the rain and screams ""Noooo"" -- theyre still getting an excellent primer on cut-and-paste pop culture wherein everything is a reference to something else and ""originality"" is a measure of how cleverly those allusions are executed. Like the two previous films about the CGI rodents with the helium singing voices ""Chipwrecked"" falls well short of the bar for wink-wink postmodernism set by ""Shrek."" But it does make surprisingly inoffensive viewing for adults who will find the semi-sly references to Sarah Palin and ""You Got Served"" a welcome distraction from the hackneyed plot which sees the three Chipmunks and their girl-group counterparts the Chipettes marooned on a desert island complete with active volcano hidden treasure and a savage native (a snarling honey badger). Theres also a castaway (Jenny Slate) who one-ups Tom Hanks by conversing with not one but five face-painted balls (tennis golf basket- base- and Nerf foot-). In between the cutesy musical covers (from the Go-Gos to Lady Gaga) the young rodents engage in harmless slapstick and even learn a bit about themselves. Naughty Alvin for example must become ""the responsible one"" after nerdy Simon is bitten by a spider and becomes possessed by his Mexican alter ego ""the most interesting munk in the world."" Meanwhile fumbling to the rescue are adoptive dad Dave (affably played by Jason Lee) and the series erstwhile villain Ian (David Cross phoning it in from inside a pelican costume). You will of course be subjected to Daves trademark shout of ""Al-VIN"" a couple of times. But if youre lucky your own little Precious will pick a quieter catchphrase to practice on the way home.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Alvin And The Chipmunks trilogy seems to take special glee in sacrificing David Cross dignity. Alvin And The Chipmunks The Squeakquel found the Mr. Show co-creator rummaging around in a Dumpster playing a disgraced record executive who pays dearly for trying to exploit the Chipmunks. The humiliation continues with Alvin And The Chipmunks Chipwrecked which ropes Cross into the proceedings under the flimsiest of pretenses--hes so washed up in the record industry the only job he can get is as an entertainer on a cruise ship--then requires him to spend nearly the entire film in a grubby pelican costume. It is not a role overly conducive to the preservation of dignity or self-respect. Then again what in Chipwrecked is? Sporting a default look of weary resignation Jason Lee returns as the caretaker of rodent superstars Alvin And The Chipmunks and their distaff counterparts The Chipettes. Chipwrecked finds Lee escorting the Chipmunks and Chipettes to an international awards show via a luxury cruise ship but before the gala event can occur the musical rodents with the unbearably squeaky voices are ship-wrecked on a remote island with only a mysterious castaway (the charmingly daft Jenny Slate) for company. On the island Simon trades in his dreary old persona for a dashing new French alter-ego after getting bitten by a spider and Alvin loses his rock-star mojo after his brothers flashy new persona wows everyone but Chipwrecked functions primarily as a bright flashy delivery system for sped-up covers of pop hits from the past few decades including a Chipette version of the Lady Gaga queer anthem ""Born This Way."" Even by the exceedingly lenient standards of second sequels to terrible kids films Chipwrecked feels particularly arbitrary and devoid of inspiration. It all but apologizes for its ridiculous mercenary existence with a running time well under 90 minutes and rapid-fire pacing that hurries the little ones out the door as quickly as possible so they can get on with their day. With its wall-to-wall pop covers Chipwrecked isnt a kids movie so much as a brightly animated instantly forgettable animated feature-length advertisement for the NOW Thats What I Call Music compilation series of contemporary pop hits.

In addition to the successful movie franchise the contemporary incarnation of Alvin and the Chipmunks has also pretty much established that critics are never going to show it any love. That being the case if the true gauge of a worthy sequel is consistency then it would be fair to say that Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked is every bit as frantic frenetic groan-inducing and all around grating as its two predecessors. PHOTOS The Big Screens Evolution of Talking Animals From the p.o.v. of its targeted young audiences (its G-rated as opposed to those prior PG ratings) it should handily do the trick at the holiday box office although it still would have been nice if they could have made a slight effort to instill the Ross Bagdasarian Sr. characters with a modicum of charm and inventiveness. The plot if you could call it that has Alvin Simon and Theodore (again provided by the sped-up voices of Justin Long Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney) wreaking havoc aboard a luxury liner much to the eternal chagrin of their ""dad"" Dave (a contractually sincere but nevertheless embarrassed-looking Jason Lee). Once again Alvins shenanigans lead to no good--in this case landing all the Munks and Chipettes (the returning Amy Poehler Anna Faris and Christina Applegate although good luck telling their characters apart) on a remote island with an active volcano and a crazed fortune hunter (former SNL cast-member Jenny Slate). Theyre soon joined by Dave and the ever-conniving Uncle Ian (David Cross) who spends the entire film stuck in a pelican suit. PHOTOS Its a Zoo This Season 23 Awards Contenders Featuring Animals While incoming director Mike Mitchell (Shrek Forever After) admittedly keeps the Munks moving at a chipper clip the script by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger -- they also penned the Squeakquel -- settles for well-worn pop culture references (James Bond Cast Away) and wince-worthy puns like ""You can follow me on Critter."" At least theres a glimmer of inspiration in some of those song choices. Aside from sampling recent hit offerings from Lady Gaga Katy Perry and LMFAO the film actually mines a bit of humor by having the marooned Chipettes singing defeated a cappella snippets of Destinys Childs ""Survivor"" and The Go-Gos ""Vacation."" Remarkably The Ballad of Gilligans Isle didnt make the cut.

Puns like these would be unforgivable coming from a human. From high-pitched rodents they prompt calls for an exterminator.It starts with the title ""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked"" the third in the noxiously contemporary series of new Chipmunks films. Following 2009s ""Squeakquel"" ""Chipwrecked"" as a title is actually rather subtle and demure.But like the earlier two ""Chipwrecked"" is full of the cheapest kind of pop culture references. Here is Alvin aping James Bond with a tail ""shaken not stirred"" a suggestion to follow the Chipmunks on ""Critter"" and gulp a Charlie Sheen-ism of ""winning.""This latest Chipmunks film directed by Mike Mitchell (""Shrek Forever After"") is aimed at a slightly younger demographic than the prior movies (its rated G) and perhaps shallow references like these are enough to delight youngsters. But I doubt it. And besides I wonder if parents would really want stale cringe-worthy expressions like ""Awkward"" instilled in another generation.In ""Chipwrecked"" the Chipmunks father figure Dave Seville (Jason Lee looking vaguely hostage-like) is taking his diminutive computer-generated friends on a vacation cruise en route to the Grammy-esque International Music Awards.If you havent followed the two earlier films the Chipmunks that 1950s novelty creation by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. have been restyled as tiny pop stars who burst into song-and-dance routines like a sped-up annoying version of ""Glee."" Alvin (Justin Long) Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler and Alan Tudyk) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) were in the last film joined by the Chipettes Brittany (Christina Applegate) Jeanette (Anna Faris) and Eleanor (Amy Poehler).All return here but dont mind the voice credits They all sound the same.The theme is troublemaking and overzealous parenting. Alvins brash misbehaving leads to the chipmunks thrown overboard and washing up on a deserted island. Searching for them are Dave and the chipmunks old rival a former music executive played by David Cross (who can only do only so much to help).On the remote jungle island they search for clues and uncover a vast conspiracy that stretches across multiple planes of time. Oops that was ""Lost."" In ""Chipwrecked"" Alvin learns to be responsible a fellow castaway (Jenny Slate) hunts for gold and Simon develops a French accent after being bitten by a spider.""Alvin and the Chipmunks Chipwrecked"" a 20th Century Fox release is rated G.
