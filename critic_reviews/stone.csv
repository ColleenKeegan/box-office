Roberto Duran remains the greatest lightweight boxer in history and one of the most celebrated fighters period. But unlike such legends of the ring as Muhammad Ali Sugar Ray Leonard or Mike Tyson he never had a very idiosyncratic boxing style. He didnt dance or rope-a-dope or use his fists like a Mack truck. He was a paragon of classic quickness and power a bruiser who wasted no time going in for the kill. ""Hands of Stone"" a Duran biopic that lifts its title from his fists-of-fury nickname has a tone that very much mirrors Durans mode of fighting. Directed by the Venezuelan-born Jonathan Jakubowicz who also wrote the script the film punches ahead in a conventional aggressive no-frills way. At this point of course the bar for boxing films has been set rather staggeringly high. ""Raging Bull"" turned the pugilistic melodrama into Shakespearean blood opera (it also had the greatest fight scenes that had ever been staged) and in recent years other movies have only built upon its achievement. ""The Fighter"" with its dizzying use of hand-held camera put the audience even more close-up into the ring and ""Creed"" with its fight scenes coming at you in astonishingly fluid unbroken takes just upped the existential intensity. ""Hands of Stone"" by contrast gets the job done but its hard to escape the feeling that youre watching a routinely conceived rather generic boxing flick. Its utterly competent yet it makes Durans story seem a little so-what? The movie may wind up being positioned as yet another ""prestige"" spectacle of fight-club awards bait but in this case the prospects look modest. The films limitation begins with the reality that were never asked to feel very close to Duran as a character -- and not because hes such a cocky angry even abusive SOB. (That didnt keep us from having a profound identification with Jake LaMotta.) Rather as played by Edgar Ramirez hes a hothead who rarely slips out of his standard strutting mode of bellicose self-satisfaction. Hes drafted into the boxing ring as a young boy growing up in Panama and what drives him from the start is that hes got a chip on his shoulder a mile wide. Its all about the United States -- the country that colonized Panama by building and controlling the Canal Zone starting in 1904 -- and also about his father who abandoned him and (to add insult to injury) was an American. The Roberto who emerges from this double slap of humiliation is a blustery macho with a hidden inferiority complex. When he spies on the street a precocious schoolgirl named Felicidad (played as an angel of fire by Ana de Armas) and announces within 30 seconds of meeting that he wants to marry her we recognize a young mans bravado but it already appears that Robertos desire to dominate is out of control. Hes set up as a world-class fighter by Carlos Eleta (Ruben Blades) the richest man in Panama but the key figure in his boxing life isnt this moneybags manager. Its the legendary trainer Ray Arcel (Robert De Niro) who in the course of a 50-year career has trained 18 world champions but he was drummed out of the business by the Mob all for the crime of wanting to take boxing national by setting up his own television deals. In Roberto he glimpses a hungry fury that makes him want to get back in the game -- though to placate the gangster who forced him to retire (played by John Turturro in a performance so understated that you wish he always played quiet gangsters) hes forced to take no payment for his services. Ray is 72 by the time he hooks up with Roberto and De Niro with scraggly gray-white hair framing a high forehead that makes him look like Lee Strasberg in ""The Godfather Part II"" plays him as a disarmingly articulate mentor-coach an analyst of the sweet science one who keeps insisting to Roberto that a winning bout comes down to strategy. Every detail counts like the way that Ray at ringside combs back Robertos hair between rounds so that hell come out each time looking fresh as a way to psych out his opponent. De Niro his dialogue salted with Yiddishisms like schmendrick plays Ray as a tough nut of decency and hes by far the most compelling presence in the film. The trajectory of Durans career comes off as fairly standard and Jakubowicz though hes an energized filmmaker doesnt find many nuances within the situations. Roberto keeps scoring knockouts on his way to the top and then he becomes the lightweight champion of the world by clobbering Sugar Ray Leonard who up until then has been undefeated. Leonard is played by the pop star Usher (here billed as Usher Raymond IV) and its a nifty piece of casting because the actor with a touch of prosthetics doesnt just look like Leonard he embodies his exuberant nimble-kill spirit. Duran is able to undermine Sugar Ray with sadistic psychological warfare He bursts into a cafeteria to insult Leonards wife which is really his way of luring Sugar Ray into his own aggressive orbit and away from Leonards subtler fight game. And then comes the downfall. Robertos manager eager to make an 8 million score arranges with Don King -- played with wily finesse by Reg. E. Cathey -- for Duran to fight Sugar Ray again just five months later. Duran hasnt stopped partying to celebrate his first victory and hes put on 40 pounds which he has to lose. But the real thing hes lost is his desire. The rematch that takes place in the New Orleans Superdome on Nov. 25 1980 is one of the most famously strange boxing matches in history because Duran fought it for a while and then he just...gave up. No one quite knew why but it should be the job of a biopic to take a legendary event like that and reconfigure it into a dramatic experience letting us see it from the inside. But in ""Hands of Stone"" it is just one more incident served up with explosive yet rather unexciting neutrality.

Reply hight says May 20 2016 at 707 am ver 40 lbs before the 2nd Leonard fight One of the greatest fighters Ever Probably 2nd only to Ali Reply Audrie L says May 18 2016 at 148 pm Andres coleman Im sorry but I do not agree with you saying that it has to do with Latinos. Please do not generalize. Im french and let me tell you that I actually like it and think it was very refreshing. Just wanted to say that after seeing all the movies at the festival for me this was the higlight of Cannes. Mr. De Niro perfomance is magnificent. Im not a boxing fan but this film is very well done. Will definetly recommend it. Bravo Reply Kevin says May 17 2016 at 1119 am ANDRES COLEMAN Not everyone is Euro centric here. I probably know as much as you do re. DURAN and I met him in person before the fight w/ HEARNS in 1984. I just hope they did our man justice because he is without doubt pound for pound the greatest fighter since ROBINSON and achieved things even RAY didnt .... I am one of the few people who actually KNOW what happened during the ""NO MAS"" debacle...and it has to do w/ the PANAMANIAN MOB and DURANS wifes gambling problems. Ill bet THATS not in the movie. Peace Reply Andres Coleman says May 17 2016 at 952 am This is the reason I came to Cannes I saw the film and love it. Im latino and this is the thruth about Durans life. Creed is the most cheesy film ever its a cliche and an egocentric attempt to reddem Stallone. DP of this fil is amazing and I really enjoyed the music. The figths where very fun to watch and extremy accurate. Im a Boxing fan and I know every round Duran fought. lets face it. The fact that a LATINO is a hero just makes everyone mad because finally we are not telling a story about a a drugloard someone crossing the border or A protitute. Its a fantastic film and I believe the 54 million Latinos in the USA will support it. Who are also the one that pay the tickets...
