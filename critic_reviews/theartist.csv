He also has conjured up a clever meta-story with shades of Singin in the Rain and A Star Is Born about a silent-film star clinging to the past as Hollywood eagerly embraces the future.Yet even if the film -- which earned six Golden Globe nominations and is expected to be a front-runner for the Best Picture Oscar -- sometimes threatens to turn into a postmodern hall of mirrors it displays so much visual imagination and Hazanavicius and his lead actors are so goofily zealous that the effect is genuinely transporting.For 100 blessedly low-key minutes you get to leave the noise and rat-a-tat visual chaos of contemporary moviemaking far behind.As the movie opens in 1927 George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a winking narcissist standing backstage as his latest silent-opus premiere to rapturous applause. With his pencil mustache and slicked back hair he is meant to evoke any number of silent icons like Rudolph Valentino (note the similarity of the last name) and John Gilbert. But even in the 1920s the world is far more interested in celebrity than art.The next morning the trades are filled not with gushing reviews but photographs of Georges accidental run-in upon leaving the theater with a would-be actress named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo).The fading star the rising ingenue and the love that threatens to be extinguished by pride and ego -- the story of The Artist is as old as well silent movies. In short order George is told by his producer (John Goodman) that the talkies are coming a technology the star adamantly resists. Peppy meanwhile lands a gig as an extra and then a bit player eventually working her way up to a contract as a star player at the studio.After Georges wife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him the actor sinks into a pit of bankruptcy and despair with only his loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) and Jack Russell terrier (Uggy who steals even the scenes he isnt in) for companionship.For the most part The Artist succeeds in both winking at the audience and engaging us in the melodrama. Much credit for that goes to Dujardin and Bejo who display such casual mastery of the silent movie acting vernacular -- the just-this-side-of-mugging facial expressions the broad physical gestures -- that you invest in them as real people.And Hazanavicius is a wonderfully clever showman who keeps finding ways to inhabit both the past and the present simultaneously. In a dream sequence for instance George keeps hearing ambient sound the stomping of feet or the laughter of women but cant make any noise himself when he attempts to scream.If The Artist never quite rises to the level of greatness its perhaps because Hazanavicius approach is fundamentally self-conscious; he may love silent movies but The Artist by conceit holds them at an arms remove. The greatest silents whether tragedies like F.W. Murnaus Sunrise (1927) or comedies like Buster Keatons Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928) still have a tremendous almost primal emotional impact -- they get us right in the gut.The Artist on the other hand is more clever than moving more beguiling than substantive. When Georges dog goes racing to save him from a burning house you laugh at the wit and speed of the sequence -- but you also know its a pastiche of silent movie conventions.Lovely and charming as The Artist is then it finally comes off as a tad precious -- a movie about movies about movies; a true blast for film buffs that may leave everyone else scratching their heads.Exclusive Angelika Dallas; Angelika Plano Tweet _ We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Movie Reviews Movie Reviews The Artist and Carnage 1 0 By David Elliott Dec. 14 2011 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it Glad tidings of coming holiday gifts The Artist  ""I wont talk"" silently mouths an actor in the silent movie being made inside The Artist a film that is itself almost entirely silent in speech. Soon after a studio sign says Please Be Silent. But you will be hearing the humming sound of your own thoughts along with laughs as you submit happily to Michel Hazanaviciuss film. Like the best parts of Martin Scorseses Hugo this strange new film is in love with movie love. The French director whose clever but corny Bond parody OSS 117 did not prepare me for this has made a silky valentine to silent Hollywood. Come Oscar time the buzzing hive of modern Hollywood may respond with a prize or two (I personally nominate the lead actor). This black-and-white film has an impeccable spirit of devotion to old show biz and to our imagination of what it once was. It doesnt have to be wildly funny or perfectly plotted to sustain its power of artful silence (words are heard only near the end and the simple story requires few on-screen dialogue cards). The ace card is the casting of Jean Dujardin as American star George Valentin whose popularity withers as sound comes in. His old-style Brilliantine hair and ""pencil moustache"" are often braced by a huge grin. He looks terrific in costumes or even better a three-piece suit. He loves life and movies and women and mirrors and his dog Jack a virtual clone of Asta in the Thin Man series (he is played by three Jack Russell terriers Uggie Dash and Dude). As jaunty George grins poses and wanders his sad wife droops like a potted palm (Penelope Ann Miller had more fun as Edna Purviance Charlies favorite costar in 1992s Chaplin). Georges bounding gusto recalls Douglas Fairbanks Sr. the Hollywood ""king"" (before Clark Gable) who aged quickly after sound came in. He looks like the forgotten 30s star Warren William and he soulfully echoes John Gilbert another major moustache and a gifted actor who was ruined less by talk than the control mania of the Mayer-Thalberg regime at MGM. Despite the devoted support of Greta Garbo Gilbert became a truly painful figure and Hazanavicius was smart not to overdo the comparison. Resisting sound George produces a silent film (a bomb) and then sulks and drinks gives up the mansion auctions his treasures even sadly fires his devoted servant (James Cromwell almost as loyal as the dog Jack). Through it all Dujardin has great dignity is hugely likeable and pulls off touches of comic poignancy not far from Chaplins. As Peppy Miller who grabs the golden ring of sound and whose love for George stalls for a while in wistful friendship Berenice Bejo is certainly committed (in life she is Hazanaviciuss partner). She sure is peppy though female stars of the era had more flesh; the skinny gals rose up later with Ida Lupino Lauren Bacall and Veronica Lake. Bejo who looks like a prettier Carol Burnett is a plot device to bring on the smiles kisses and meet-cutes. She is what that era would have called ""swell."" Dujardins true costar is the immaculate design the old devices (spinning headlines dissolves wipe-cuts well-dressed crowds) the not-too-computerized vistas of classic L.A. -- above all the lovely tonalities of gray and silver which are mostly quite close to what old movies looked like. The actors (Cromwell Miller Ed Lauter Malcolm McDowell and as the studio boss John Goodman) fold into the atmosphere like pale mute ghosts of themselves. The film murmurs delicate echoes of A Star Is Born and silent comedies and that great joyful lie about the coming of sound Singin in the Rain. You dont need to be a buff to feel the pleasure. Guillaume Schiffmans photography rivals Gordon Williss for Zelig Woody Allens tricky comedy about 20s celebrity mania. The wittiest touch is that George so loves his silent-but-virile world of movie heroics that he seems to think and dream in silence. In a nightmare he hears simple bathroom devices making noises like subversive imps. Talk threatens his complacently happy posturing as a star though he is never a dumb ditz like Jean Hagen in Singin in the Rain. (But is George really an artist? His films seem pretty bad.) The retro cliches are not stale -- as Hazanavicius has said the ""grammar of the movie is to play with cliches and the cliches protect each other."" In the later 1932 segment of the film the official portrait of President Calvin Coolidge in a public building is several years too late and the use of yearning music from Hitchcocks Vertigo is 26 years too early (and rather impudent). But that pilferage works surprisingly well and is clearly Hazanaviciuss tribute to a greater artist. Less witty than Zelig less rich in Depression emotion than Pennies from Heaven less stunningly stylized than Kerry Conrans Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow this oddball charmer is still a triumph marching blithely to its own silent drummer. Dujardin so much more than a nostalgia moustache gives it the heart of a star. Carnage If you want a talkie -- All Talking All Snapping All Bitching -- the motor mouth is Carnage. The mouth comes with a good body for no one in the past 20 years has made movies more lucidly designed or crisply controlled than has Roman Polanski. Consider Bitter Moon The Ninth Gate The Pianist Oliver Twist and The Ghost Writer. This is hardly surprising for back in 1973 Polanski directed what may be the most handsomely packaged narrative film of the modern era Chinatown. Carnage another fine-looking job is an effectively filmed play. Yasmina Rezas Tony-winning drama The God of Carnage is in go-for-the-jugular theatrical debt to Edward Albee and his two-couple spin of squirming and laceration Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Yep the Woolf is at the door again. The revelation by now fairly redundant is that every sophisticated adult has a child inside screaming to get out and make a mess.

CAST Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo John Goodman James Cromwell LENGTH 140 Its Christmas weekend and youre looking at moviegoing options galore Cruise Damon Spielberg (twice) and many others. With all this excitement do you really want to see ""The Artist"" a movie thats French black-and-white and silent? You definitely do. It isnt arty or intellectual though it is artful and ingenious and its the rare crowd-pleaser that never feels obvious or pandering. Film snobs will appreciate the glorious revival of a lost art form but if youre simply looking for a charming romantic endlessly entertaining movie this is your winning ticket. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The self-reflexive narrative (I did say it was French) follows silent-film star George Valentin marvelously played by Jean Dujardin as a hammy charmer whos equal parts Douglas Fairbanks Gene Kelly and William Powell. In the opening scene Valentin hogs the limelight at a premiere sidelining his unhappy actress-wife (Penelope Ann Miller) in favor of his other co-star an Asta-esque terrier (Uggie with understudies). But the limelight shifts when Hollywoodland discovers sound. ""If thats the future you can have it"" Valentin says -- via title card of course -- to studio mogul Al Zimmer (John Goodman). Zimmer turns instead to young chatterbox Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo utterly beguiling) whose star rises as Valentin spirals into alcoholism. His faithful manservant (James Cromwell) sticks by him as does the dog but Peppy secretly remains Valentins biggest fan. Dujardin and Bejo are absolute magic; their scene on a movie set botching take after take as they gaze into each others eyes is one of the loveliest things Ive ever seen. Meantime writer-director Michel Hazanavicius swoons over cinema itself paying tribute to countless classics and toying with nearly every aspect of the medium (youll have to listen as well as watch).

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.""The Artist"" starring Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo has distilled cinema to something it so rarely achieves pure joy in art.Story highlights""The Artist"" is a film everyone should see because its joyousThe story is relatively simple and takes plot elements from ""Singing in the Rain""The film is peppered with sight gags in the best of classic Hollywood traditionI am probably neither the first nor last critic to say this but Michel Hazanavicius ""The Artist"" is a flawless film. There is literally nothing wrong with it. I dont have a single nit to pick minor flaw to point out or little bit that annoyed me. It is pure magic from the first frame to the last. It is proof that to be moving engaging enthralling and fun movies have no need for sex or violence color or even spoken dialog for that matter.Thats not to say I dont love many films with all those things but ""The Artist"" has distilled cinema to something it so rarely achieves pure joy in art. This is not art for arts sake this is art for enjoyments sake. Its not an ""important"" film that we all need to see because its great art (although it is both important and art) it is a film that everyone should see because its joyous. Its stunningly beautiful. Its a throwback to some of the things that brought people into the cinema in the first place. The chance to escape their lives and live someone elses for a time.The story is relatively simple and takes plot elements from ""Singing in the Rain"" ""Citizen Kane"" and ""A Star is Born"" as well as the best of Hollywood melodrama. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinee idol a star of the (silent) silver screen. Along with his faithful Jack Russell terrier (Uggie) Valentin stars in action adventures and is revered by men and women alike. Its the age old story Men want to be him and women want to be with him. At the premiere of his latest blockbuster as George is mugging for the cameras and signing autographs he runs into Peppy Miller (a luminous Berenice Bejo) an aspiring actor. They meet cute when she is caught in the throng of autograph seekers (she is one herself) and suddenly finds herself on the other side of the policemen holding back the crowd and standing right next to her idol.Taking advantage of the situation Peppy begins to mug planting one on her idols cheek landing the pair on the cover of Variety and setting the plot in motion a variation on the old ""boy meets girl"" standard. While George is reveling in his box office glory and Peppy is hoping to make the most of her instant fame Georges wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) is stewing in jealousy and resentment. And while the photo in Variety is completely innocent one gets the feeling her fears may not be completely groundless.Peppy lands a gig as an extra in Georges next film and the obvious attraction between the two begins to manifest itself. Peppy is a starstruck aspiring actress just beginning her career in show business and George is a veteran movie star and ladies man at the top of his game. You also get the feeling hes been in this situation before.Things are going well for George. Despite the unrest at home hes got a new film hes got a new crush and all is right in his world until the head of the studio Al Zimmer (John Goodman) begins to embrace the talkies. While Al is convinced that the advent of sound is the future of film George is convinced the public will stick with him so he bets on the continued popularity of the silent film. Thus his career begins to wane just as Peppys beings to wax.The end of the silent era (and his marriage) and the crash of the stock market send George into a spiral of booze and self-loathing with only his faithful dog and chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell) sticking by him. Bitter over the demise of his career George even lashes out at what he sees as the symbol of that decline Peppy.""The Artist"" isnt actually a silent film per se as it has a score and well I wont spoil it for you but Hazanavicius use of sound is ingenious. However for all intents and purposes it is silent. For the actors there was very little difference as they still speak their lines we just dont hear them but for the audience the change is immeasurable. Instead of watching their faces almost exclusively we find our eyes drifting across the screen and noticing things that perhaps we might not have noticed otherwise.A subtle cue of body language the placing of objects within the frame how the music moves the action along all of these and more come alive when were not tied to watching the actors speak. Hazanavicius has a deft hand at directing and a delightful sense of whimsey. The film is peppered with sight gags in the best of classic Hollywood tradition and both Dujardin and Bejo prove more than up for the task. A brief pantomime between Bejo and one of Georges suit jackets is worth the price of admission alone -- and keep your eye on the dogHazanavicius and his backers took a huge risk in making the film. They funded a black and white silent film with two unknown (in the United States) leads and a handful of supporting Hollywood talent. However when Dujardin picked up the best actor prize at Cannes and reviews started to pour in they knew they had a winner on their hands.A pure and open love letter to the cinema ""The Artist"" contains many nods and winks to the history of this art form and clever viewers will pick up on a few cues. It is as I have mentioned a comedy a melodrama and a romance but above all it fulfills the promise of what cinema can be at its best. It takes us on a journey up to the peaks and down in the valleys through love loss heartbreak and despair and right back around again to love. ""The Artist"" is rated PG-13 although its on the tame end of the scale. A bird is flipped there are a few moments of characters in jeopardy and quite a bit of smoking if that sort of thing bothers you.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

Relegated to postage-stamp-sized newspaper ads ghettoized in big-city art-house theaters and often fetishized by critics who assume subtitles mean quality foreign films released stateside arrive cloaked in mystery and prestige--and then are ignored by most moviegoers. Now that the summers industrially processed rom-coms and budget-busting action flicks have given way to the comparatively refined offerings of autumn viewers will be able to discover a particularly bold and diverse crop of foreign films. The lot includes new works from France Spain Argentina Iran Japan and Finland in which directors some long-cherished others barely known tackle subjects like prostitution gender identity adolescent love depression presidential politics immigration grisly crime grislier revenge and cinema itself. Though some of the best foreign titles to recently secure North American distribution (Nuri Bilge Ceylans Once Upon a Time in Anatolia from Turkey Joseph Cedars Footnote from Israel and Christophe Honores Beloved from France) wont hit US screens until 2012 several of those with upcoming release dates are very much worth seeking out. Others less so. Heres a look at which of the forthcoming much-talked-about foreign-language films are worth seeing.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"Artist The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; artist-the ) Artist The (France 2011) December 27 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli To label The Artist as an homage to the silent era is to undervalue what director Michel Hazanavicius has achieved with this movie. In a time when bigger louder and more spectacular is interpreted as being ""better"" he has turned the clock back to a time when although the technology was simpler the experience was magical. Not only is The Artist an affectionate callback to the early days of cinema its a recreation of the melodramas of the time with just a hint of a spoof around the edges. Hazanavicius isnt just making a ""silent movie"" he is attempting to enter a time warp and craft something that would fool all but the most studious and scholarly into believing it could have been a lost film from a bygone era. If his tongue is sometimes a little in his cheek thats all part of the fun. It might be possible to argue that The Artists aesthetic - made in black and white with little in the way of a soundtrack (other than the score) and using the Academy aspect ratio (43) - is a gimmick if the style was not so critical to the story. The Artist could not spin the same tale if made using conventional 2011 movie-making techniques. It would seem hopelessly naA-ve and the themes would be strained and ungainly. Theres no doubt that The Artist boasts a novelty factor and it plays the nostalgia card boldly and unashamedly but the sweet and occasionally sappy result is emotionally satisfying. 75 years ago this would have been mainstream entertainment; today its art house fare. Certainly such a reflection of how tastes have changed is one of the reasons Hazanavicius made The Artist as he did. The Artist spans a five year period beginning in 1927 and concluding in 1932. For Hollywood (and the film industry in general) that was a time of great change and upheaval. The first talkie arrived on the scene in October 1927 and spelled almost immediate doom for the silent film. In 1929 at the first Academy Awards ceremony six films were nominated for variations of what would become the Best Picture award - all were silent. One year later in 1930 four of the five nominees were talkies. The only silent film to get a nod was The Patriot (for which a soundtrack of music and effects had been added in post-production) - it was the last of its kind to receive acknowledgment. Chaplins City Lights considered by many critics (and Orson Welles) to be his best work was ignored by the Academy. The Artist tracks these years by focusing on two characters whose careers are on opposite trajectories. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a star of the silent era with more power than the producers and directors who cast him. One day he poses for a photograph with an ardent fan Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who catches the acting bug and appears as an extra in Valentins next film. Over the next two years as sound movies invade theaters Valentins fortunes fall as Peppys rise. In 1929 the head of Valentins studio Al Zimmer (John Goodman) breaks the news to his friend that they are pulling the plug on silent films. Undaunted Valentin funds and produces his own movie which is a flop. The Crash of 1929 wipes him out financially and he is forced to move in with his chauffeur (James Cromwell). Unemployed and destitute he sells all his possessions to stay afloat. Meanwhile Peppy has become Americas sweetheart. And as Valentin used his clout in 1927 to force Zimmer to hire Peppy she returns the favor in his darkest hour. For a movie that is so much about technique its surprising how affecting the story is. Even with the actors adopting the grandiose styles of their 1920s/30s counterparts and with intertitles limited to the bare minimum The Artists romanticism and melodrama is capable of sweeping away viewers. We are not only fascinated by the ramifications of the paradigm shift in Hollywood but we care about the main characters - the suave likeable Valentin (and his dog) and the appropriately-named Peppy. The film has no villains unless one considers the publics fickle taste and the advance of technology to be foes. Still what makes The Artist so much more than a version of A Star Is Born is how it is presented. And the movie is special not just because its silent but because of the effort invested to give it a genuine 20s look and feel and because so much love is evident in the final product. The Artist was made by people with an understanding of film history and an appreciation for what it would take to honor two eras - the late-silent/early talky one and the early 21st century one - in a single movie. The camera work and overall approach might be that of a 1930 motion picture but the story requires more distance. It took decades for silent films to be viewed more as an important and artistic aspect of movie history than as quaint archaic and inferior. The acting is superb across-the-board in the way it recalls performances of 80 years ago. Jean Dujardin not only acts and looks the part (think Douglas Fairbanks) but he has a name that many silent film stars would have relished. He was chosen for the part based on a past collaboration with Hazanavicius - the two previously worked on a pair of spy movie spoofs. Berenice Bejo also has a history with the director having appeared in those same movies while filling an off-screen role as his wife. The majority of the supporting cast is filled by Americans including a bigger-than-life scene-stealing turn by John Goodman. Malcolm McDowell manages an odd cameo. If theres one often-overlooked cinematic element that helps The Artist to work its Ludovic Bources score. In a movie with no dialogue and (almost) no sound effects (this rule is broken in a surreal dream sequence) the music is asked to carry a much heavier load than in a normal motion picture. It is rightly said that on a home DVD presentation (when a live performance is not possible) the nature of the score can alter how a silent film is interpreted. Bources music is excellent underlining emotions - playful at times and somber at others. The Artist contains many elements that will keep unadventurous viewers away - its French demands reading of the dialogue and is in black-and-white. Yet despite those things (or perhaps because of them) its one of the most enjoyable of 2011s crop of ""elite"" films. While it has something to say about the publics attitude toward stardom The Artist is most entertaining because like Hugo it celebrates the history of cinema by giving us an engaging new chapter.

Anonymous In this film publicity image released by The Weinstein Company Jean Dujardin portrays George Valentin in ""The Artist."" Dujardin was nominated Wednesday Dec. 14 2011 for a Screen Actors Guild award for best actor for his role in ""The Artist."" The 18th annual SAG Awards will be presented Jan. 29. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company) Charlie Chaplin was the brightest star of silent cinema yet many of his masterpieces -- ""City Lights"" ""Modern Times"" ""The Great Dictator"" -- were made after the invention of talkies. Chaplin was trained as a physical comedian not a verbal one and he held his tongue until the last minutes of ""The Great Dictator"" when he warned the audience against the looming threat of right-wing storm troopers.More than 80 years after ""The Jazz Singer"" popularized sound a few purists still maintain that black-and-white silent movies were superior to Technicolor talkies but no one since Chaplin has made the case more effectively than French director Michel Hazanavicius in his delightful tribute ""The Artist.""This mock melodrama is loosely based on the fate of matinee idol John Gilbert whose career capsized because he had a weak voice but the self-conscious spoofery is more akin to ""Singin in the Rain."" Hazanavicius is an astute student of movie history and his previous two films were satirical updates of the 1960s secret-agent series ""O.S.S. 117."" For his latest parody Hazanavicius has reunited with star Jean Dujardin but the difference between the single-note grooviness of ""Lost in Rio"" and the symphonic glory of ""The Artist"" is like the difference between shag carpet and champagne. Dujardin stars as George Valentin a Hollywood heartthrob circa 1927. Hes strutting on top of the world until an avalanche called audio knocks him off his feet. While hes downsized by a sympathetic studio chief (John Goodman) and abandoned by his haughty wife (Penelope Ann Miller) George watches with bemusement as an ingenue named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) rises from a fan outside his movie premiere to the marquee attraction who lures the audience away from his self-financed silent thriller.For students of cinematic craft ""The Artist"" is a master class with exquisite black-and-white cinematography skillful montage sequences and emotive music. Even the silence is used to creative effect and when George hears sound for the first time its like the frightening flash of color in ""Pleasantville."" Although Georges loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) his life-saving terrier and his star-crossed affection for the meteoric Peppy are supposed to telegraph pathos theres a steady undercurrent of comedy that keeps the movie buoyant.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The audacity required of ""The Artist"" director Michel Hazanavicius begs for an old-fashioned compliment. Here it is Moxie. It took a whole lot of moxie for the French writer-director to make a silent movie in a time of cacophonous explosions and gross-out repartee. A silent movie shot in sumptuous black-and-white no less. A silent flick made with not a jot of distancing winking but instead born of a heady affection for a bygone very bygone era of filmmaking. Now Hazanavicius boldness is being rewarded with a slew of critical kudos as well as Screen Actors Guild Award and Golden Globe nominations. The vigorous praise for this tale of a silent-era star struggling against the tide of the talkies includes nods for stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo. And at least for this week the pleasingly fizzy cocktail with a dash of bitters is being considered by a number of Oscar prognosticators the frontrunner for best picture. ""The Artist"" is set in Los Angeles where it was shot. George Valentin is a star at the apex of his popularity. Kinograph mogul Al Zimmer (John Goodman) encourages his stars shameless joyous mugging. Georges driver Clifton (James Cromwell) knows his boss weaknesses but also enables Georges vast self-regard. He has a glamorous wife in Doris (Penelope Ann Miller). Hes even followed -- and upstaged regularly -- by a whip-smart Jack Russell terrier sure to evoke that wise movie pup of yore Asta. George is in fact a mega star. (So by the way is his portrayer Dujardin who was awarded the Cannes film festival prize for best actor.) This means not only is George unprepared for the advent of talking pictures but also he cant accept that its going to change life for him. But long before his star begins to wane he meets a chorus girl who in ""A Star Is Born"" fashion will be a quasar. Peppy Miller (Bejo) knows she has something. Its clear from the moment she is forced after a happy accident to play along with the matinee idol. Their attraction is teased but chaste even when she is cast in one of Valentins movies. One of Hazanavicius more winning moments finds the suave star and the pretty day-player enduring take after take of a dance scene. Each cut and call for action changes their demeanor. Its funny. Its romantic. Its resonantly retro. As Peppys career takes off Georges falters. Hes a silent star dumbstruck and ""The Artist"" follows him to some dark places. But theres more light than shadow. You want the darkness you head to ""Sunset Boulevard."" ""The Artist"" -- like George at his best -- aims to please. It mugs beautifully. Youre likely to smile in kind. ""THE ARTIST.""

Motion-capture whatever. If you want real movie enchantment forget the technical gewgaws. ""The Artist"" a gleefully inventive gloriously entertaining black-and-white silent proves that less is more. Its a rocket to the moon fueled by unadulterated joy and pure imagination. The story is set in Hollywood in the waning days of silent film. Yes yes youve heard this one before but the old story has never been told this well. ""The Artist"" opens with a tuxedoed hero undergoing electroshock torture at the hands of Leninist-looking villains. As they amp up the voltage on machinery that looks borrowed from Fritz Langs ""Metropolis"" they command the prisoner to break his silence. ""Speak Speak"" the intertitles bellow. But they underestimate his determination. In short order the gentleman spy escapes the adventure ends and the film reframes itself as the glittering premiere of the feature weve just sampled with the charmingly cocky star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) taking bows on the stage of a packed movie palace. Valentin soaks up the crowds adulation upstages his leading lady and hams it up with his faithful Jack Russell terrier (played by the adorable Uggie). Theres a clowns poetry in his body language alongside the physical confidence of a matinee idol. When he exits the theater so many autograph seekers crowd the red carpet that aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) is virtually pushed into his arms and he good-naturedly invites her to pose for some gag photos. George is on top of the world but as we know from ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""Singin in the Rain"" the arrival of talking pictures cut down silent stars like a plague. Georges producer friend Al (a wonderfully expressive John Goodman) warns that times and tastes are changing and audiences want the novelty of sound and fresh new talents. Talents like Peppy who has become the seasons high-spirited ""it"" girl thanks to those gag photos with George. Peppy meets him again on the studio staircase. Shes eagerly heading up to a contract meeting as George heads dejectedly down. As the Depression and self-financed silent failures deplete his fortunes Georges trajectory takes him from his mansion to pawnshops and gin mills. But what would such a film be without a triumphant happy ending? Weinstein Co. Star Tribune Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo in ""The Artist"" Director Michel Hazanavicius worked with Dujardin on a pair of entertaining spy spoofs (the ""OSS 117"" movies worth a rent). The actor showed a jesters spirit in a leading mans body and the director gave the stories impish momentum but nothing in their partnership prepared us for this beautiful piece of work. Hazanavicius has a control over the medium that is hypnotic. He shot ""The Artist"" in the squarish screen ratio of the era and he works every simple elegant image with dazzling craftsmanship. The gags interlock symmetrically. Props are placed with surgical precision sets are dressed with exquisite attention to detail and the locations are quietly inspired (several scenes are shot among historic areas of sunny Beverly Hills). Even when the visuals are melodramatic or aggressively stylized theyre apt for the storytelling methods of the late silents. Once you step into this time capsule youre simply swept along. With his piano-keyboard grin and instinctive rapport with the camera Dujardin is a born star; if he were a native English speaker hed have George Clooney on the run. Bejo the directors wife has the sparking energy of a flapper and she looks great wriggling in a satin sheath. Shes got more depth than the typical jazz baby though. Her soulful moments are genuinely touching. When they team up for the razzle-dazzle finale their sheer delight in performing is blissful. Hollywood recognizes them as a couple of superstars and so do we.

More about The Artist >> Michel Hazanavicius the French director heretofore known for a couple of lightweight James Bond parody pastiches (the OSS 117 pics) has pulled off an amazing hat trick with The Artist a black-and-white and (mostly) mute homage to vintage moviedom. With its criminally catchy musical score (Ludovic Bource and a significant sampling of Bernard Herrmann too) and a winking but surprisingly poignant performance from Jean Dujardin The Artist reconfigures the audience/screen dynamic. Without dialogue (save for the spare use of intertitle cards) our screen senses are heightened. We take in the actors their motions and emotions more keenly. The music hits our ears differently more deeply. Strangely wonderfully The Artist feels as bold and innovative a moviegoing experience as James Camerons bells-and-whistles Avatar did a couple of years ago. Retro becomes nuevo. Quaint becomes cool. Like Singin in the Rain the great MGM musical The Artist is about Hollywoods seismic shift from silents to talkies and the difficulty some of the great stars of 20s cinema had transitioning from one format to the other. (In Singin in the Rain leading lady Lina Lamont - Jean Hagen - turns out to have a voice so hysterically high-pitched that audiences guffawed when she delivered a line.) Dujardins George Valentin is a Douglas Fairbanks-type rialto titan a handsome hero of swashbucklers and romances. He is rich and famous. He is also impossibly full of himself mugging to the press preening before adoring fans. It is at the premiere of his latest spy thriller A Russian Affair in the crush of flashing cameras and oohing crowds that he first encounters Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) a fetching flapper who dreams of making it in the movies. Their paths cross again when she wins an audition as a dancer in a new Valentin vehicle. Sparks fly. He is a married man but its a dreary marriage (Penelope Ann Miller is the unhappy spouse). He spends more time with his trusty Jack Russell Uggie than he does with his spouse. And then he starts spending time with Peppy too as her career takes off. It is 1929 and she is toplining talking pictures while Valentin convinced its all a fad is bombing at the box office. He pours all his money into a new silent production and it sinks - just like the character he plays in it chin-deep in quicksand. He starts to drink. A lot. (Theres a terrific scene at a bar where hes paid a hallucinatory visit by spear-carrying extras from his jungle adventure flop.) Valentin moves from his big manse to a tiny apartment with a Murphy bed. His life is going to blazes. Its the A Star Is Born template the alcohol-soaked old star who mentors the up-and-coming ingenue. But have no fear The Artist is the absolute opposite of a bummer. This is no dark drama of Hollywood despair. So the ending is corny and perhaps Dujardin and Bejo are not the next Fred and Ginger but who cares? Hazanavicius and his cast (which also includes James Cromwell John Goodman and Malcolm McDowell) have writ a love letter to a bygone day to bygone ways. And in doing so theyve reminded us why we love the movies and why they matter. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

""The Artist arrives in town on what feels like the end of its preliminary victory lap. A best actor winner and Palme DOr nominee at Cannes the talk of film festivals around the world named best of 2011 by critics groups in Boston New York and Washington D.C. and nominated for six Golden Globes its the current front-runner for the best picture Academy Award.Which means that its time for your expectations to be adjusted. Not downward and not because a black-and-white silent film in the new millennium is an oddity at best and a stunt at worst. The problem is that end-of-the-year plaudits equal bigness in most peoples minds and ""The Artist is a small exquisitely-cut jewel in a style everyone assumes is 80 years out of date.That assumption of course is wrong. Michael Hazanaviciuss love letter to classic cinema isnt perfect but its close enough to make just about anyone who sees it ridiculously happy - and that includes children and grown-ups who have never come across a silent film. In the face of the noisy neurotic assault vehicles that movies have become in 2011 ""The Artist asserts timeless verities a charming hero a beautiful ingenue the wit and invention of a cinema that doesnt need to talk and the awareness that times and technologies change - and that beautiful things can get left behind in the rush to the future.Its a Hollywood tale made up of familiar pieces a bit of ""Singin in the Rain a dollop of ""A Star Is Born genetic splicings from actual film history. Frances Jean Dujardin plays silent film star George Valentin a delightful popinjay whose name references Rudolph Valentino but whose career and persona are basically that of Douglas Fairbanks the movies first action hero. (To add to the pleasurable confusion Dujardins a ringer for Gene Kelly.) Like Fairbanks Valentin combines athleticism with winning joie de vivre and hes exactly the same offscreen as onscreen the king of Hollywood.Hazanavicius who also wrote the script gives Valentin a canine sidekick (played by a Jack Russell terrier named Uggie) whos just cute enough without overkill and a frosty wife (Penelope Ann Miller) with whom he shares a breakfast table out of ""Citizen Kane - the distance between the two grows longer and icier with every cut. The films rightful leading lady is a studio extra named Peppy Miller (the meltingly pretty Argentine actress Berenice Bejo a.k.a. Mrs. Hazanavicius) whose movie career ascends as Valentins plummets with the arrival of the talkies.This all sounds very inside-baseball but the shock of ""The Artist is what a crowd-pleaser it is - how Hazanavicius has created something funny comforting and oddly fresh from the ragbag of pop culture. Theres a wonderful sequence early on in which Valentin and Peppy film four takes of a scene where they have to waltz across a crowded dance floor the movie star and the extra falling harder for each other with each cut. Without color and sound their emotions are so close you can almost take them in your hands and thats what sometimes seems to have gone missing from movies - the intimacy of two people filmed without artifice.The irony is that the movie itself is artifice of the highest order - a re-creation of a vanished medium in a world that has long since moved on. And not even an exact re-creation The filmmaking style of ""The Artist is more early 1940s than late 1920s and the mix-and-match musical score cribs Bernard Herrmanns love theme from ""Vertigo made in 1958. Canadas Guy Maddin imitates silent film techniques more precisely in gonzo art-house excursions such as ""The Saddest Music in the World but Hazanavicius is after a broader audience here.What saves ""The Artist from becoming an empty exercise - what makes it one of the joys of this or any year - is the playfulness with which the story tweaks its hero even as it feels his pain. (Not coincidentally the films at its slowest when the star is at his lowest.) Why wont George Valentin talk? No one understands least of all the grumpy studio head played by John Goodman with a big fat cigar or Valentins costar Constance (Missi Pyle) the middle-finger-flipping Lina Lamont to his Don Lockwood. Even Peppy doesnt get it although the dog does and Valentins faithful chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell).Neither on some level does the movie which taunts George with sound effects in one sequence - they land like a D-day barrage on his ears and ours - and finally ushers him gracefully into a world closer to the one we live in. ""The Artist spares its hero the fate of silent idol John Gilbert who died a drunk at 38 his talkie career in tatters. Its a story of renewal rather than destruction and what it mostly renews is our faith in a story well and simply told. By celebrating the old ""The Artist has the power to make us feel new.

Daily Edition Login to download The Artist Cannes Review 608 AM PDT 5/15/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Cannes Film Festival A beguiling tale about Hollywoods silent movie days that is itself silent this made-in-L.A. French feature will charm cinephiles with its affection for one of the movies golden ages. TWITTER This black-and-white French silent feature set in 1920s Hollywood employs an enjoyable conceit writes Todd McCarthy. CANNES -- Its a good bet that most contemporary directors would have a hard time pulling off a silent movie so its all the more impressive what Michel Hazanavicius has wrought with The Artist a real black-and-white silent in the 1.33 aspect ratio that takes place in Hollywood when silents were overtaken by talkies. A playful lightly melancholy tale with A Star Is Born echoes about a young actress whose career takes off in sound pictures just as that of a veteran male star declines this unusual Los Angeles-made French production is by definition a specialty item perfect for festivals and buff enclaves worldwide but a tough proposition commercially outside France where the director and stars are household names by virtue of the OSS capers. A mustachioed and preening Jean Dujardin engagingly incarnates George Valentin a vain athletic star in the Douglas Fairbanks mode who specializes in swashbuckling romantic adventures. In 1927 at the lavish premiere of his latest extravaganza (an event shot at the Orpheum Theater in downtown L.A.) the married star takes a fancy to a pretty girl in the crowd Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who gets her picture in the papers and very soon a small role in the next Valentin production even though their relationship never progresses beyond mutual attraction. Although everything in both the films-within-a-film and the ""real"" movie looks a bit too crisp and clean lacking the soft-focus close-ups so prevalent at the time Hazanavicius and his key collaborators -- cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman and American production designer Laurence Bennett and costume designer Mark Bridges -- succeed in the important matter of approximating the general spirit and flavor of some late silent pictures notably their energy brio and direct emotional appeal. Similarly Ludovic Bources continuous score might be more elaborate and ambitious than the orchestral music that normally accompanied major silent features in big city engagements but its vigor and imagination provide Artist with a crucial boost that amplifies its numerous mood swings. Preparing to switch entirely to talkies in 1929 Kinograph Studios boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) offers Valentin a private look at the new format but the star rejects it out of hand and recklessly proceeds with his own self-financed silent adventure which is doomed to failure. By the time the stock market crash hits that October Valentin is washed up just as Peppy Millers infectious youthful appeal is taking the country by storm. Valentins downfall is complete His long-suffering wife (Penelope Ann Miller) leaves him hes forced to auction his personal effects he dismisses his ever-faithful chauffeur (a subtle and fine James Cromwell) and in a frenzy reminiscent of the room-destroying outburst in Citizen Kane he trashes his prints of his films finally lighting a match to them. His life is saved only by the efforts of his exceptionally talented last remaining friend his clever little performing dog of the type so common in the silent era. What Valentin doesnt know however is that Peppy has always remained loyal in her heart so when it counts -- and in the spirit of the title of her new film Guardian Angel -- she is there for him. During this climactic stretch when Valentin hits his deepest despair Hazanavicius and Bource daringly choose to explicitly employ Bernard Herrmanns love theme from Vertigo which is dramatically effective in its own right but is so well known that it yanks you out of one film and places you in the mind-set of another. Surely some sort of reworked equivalent would have been a better idea. Still most immediately conjuring the image of a Sean Connery lite which worked so well for him in the OSS duo Dujardin also by turns triggers physical impressions of Fredric March who starred in the first A Star Is Born and John Gilbert one of most famous silent luminaries to stumble in talkies. One minor mystery that could have been clarified by one additional inter-title is whether Valentin simply disdains sound films or might be hampered by a foreign accent. The slim and chic Bejo is entirely winning as the publics darling who never forgets who provided her big break and Goodman is perfect as the cigar-chomping studio chief who obviously loves his job. Filmed on studio stages as well as on old Hollywood streets Artist evinces unlimited love for the look and ethos of the 1920s as well for the style of the movies. The filmmakers clearly did their homework and took great pleasure in doing so an enjoyment that is passed along in ample doses to any viewer game for their nifty little conceit.

The story is a variation on that timeless movieland myth A Star Is Born Jean Dujardin plays a Hollywood matinee idol whose career unravels with the advent of the sound era and Berenice Bejo is a bit player who ascends into the stratosphere once actors become prized for their gab. No big-time commercial filmmaker has tried anything like this since Mel Brooks made his appropriately titled Silent Movie (1976) but that had a contemporary setting and favored Brookss vulgar shtick over the physical grace of the silent clowns. By contrast this 2011 effort often manages to duplicate the magical pantomime of the era; a lovely scene in which Bejo drapes herself in the arms of a hung jacket as if it were a human lover could have come straight out of a Marion Davies picture.

(Pause to let that sink in for a moment). Yes The Artist is charming as all get-out a delightful little movie about the movies. And we all know how much Hollywood likes to look at itself at least if the light is flattering enough.There are sequences of pure bliss in writer-director Michel Hazanavicius black-and-white tale of a silent Hollywood star (Jean Dujardin a master preener) who clings to his pride a little too long as the sound era moves in for the kill. One dream sequence finds him screaming in silence as everything around him - a water glass placed on a table a feather falling to the ground - makes the first non-musical noises of the film. If silent icon-turned-afterthought John Gilbert had anxiety nightmares they might feel like this.The Artist works best in isolated moments that let you forget the story is actually rather thin and that the idea for the movie is slightly superior to the movie itself. Its still quite a treat Dujardin and his co-star wide-eyed Argentine actress Berenice Bejo have a delicately structured falling-in-love sequence and Uggie a nimble Jack Russell terrier gives an animal performance that could actually be considered acting.This is a silent movie filtered through the visual language and rhythms of the sound era a novel concept that feeds our current yen for nostalgia. The adapt-or-die mandate of the industrys transition doesnt sound particularly romantic on the surface but The Artist is nothing if not a big wet kiss aimed at the love and lore of the movies.B+ Starring Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo James Cromwell John Goodman and Penelope Ann Miller.

The Artist Great Director Michel Hazanavicius. Cast Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo John Goodman. Rating PG-13 for a disturbing image and a crude gesture. This weeks new movie releases Usually. But ""The Artist"" is such an engaging delightful film that if you like movies you will walk out of the theater with a smile. You just will; its that inspired. Interview Jean Dujardin ""The Artist"" is also unusual The French film has only two words of dialogue spoken in English so the nationality of the thing hardly matters -- except that its brilliant star is known for French comedies. Chances are youve never heard of the writer or director. Also the film is shot in black-and-white -- fitting as it chronicles the effects of the introduction of sound in the movies A silent stars fortunes decline while the career of one of his young fans skyrockets. Its sweet its funny and surprisingly moving. ""The Artist"" begins in Hollywood in 1927. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a rich and famous movie star with a legion of fans a mansion a loyal driver Clifton (James Cromwell) a spoiled wife (Penelope Ann Miller) and of course a small dog -- all the trappings of early-20th-century fame. Valentin makes blockbuster hits for Kinograph a company run by Al Zimmer (John Goodman). One day a would-be dancer and Valentin fan named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) stumbles into a photo that an an early paparazzo takes of the star. The picture makes the papers heads are turned and she gets a bit of a break -- and in a sweet scene that involves Peppy dancing with Valentins coat she meets him. Nice enough but the delineation is clear Valentin is a star Peppy is an extra at best. Then a funny thing happens Sound comes to the movies and Zimmer decides to go all-in on the new technology. He announces that Kinograph no longer will make silent films -- a decision that horrifies Valentin. Sound is a fad the latter protests but when that gets him nowhere he strikes out on his own producing his own film. A familiar story follows. Peppys fame grows as Valentins career -- and his life as the two are tightly linked -- spirals downward with only the loyal Clifton (and the actors dog) remaining by his side. In fact much of the plot is predictable although there are a few surprises along the way in which writer and director Michel Hazanvicius makes good use of what others might find a limitation the lack of sound and dialogue other than what pops up written on cards. There are nods to more silent movies and stars than youll care to tally. Thats fun as far as it goes but whats important is that Hazanvicius and Dujardin create characters and situations that feel original -- situations that despite the broadly played bits familiar to silent-film fans have the same heart found in the movies of Charlie Chaplin Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. Credit Dujardin for a lot of that. His grace and carriage allow him to float through the dance scenes hes funny in the comic bits yet he brings enough weight to the down-and-out segments to break your heart. Bejo too is outstanding as the star who never forgets where she came from -- or who inspired her. But its Hazanvicius who ultimately is responsible for the film of course having created it and brought all the elements together masterfully so. ""The Artist"" refers to Valentin naturally but for Hazanvicius whose brilliant work has produced one of the years best movies its an apt description as well.

"The Artist movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Artist is artful in the way it wins you over -- 3 1/2 starsDecember 21 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticPlease be silent behind the screen.Backstage at the 1927 Hollywood premiere of his latest screen triumph film star George Valentin -- played with irresistible zest by Jean Dujardin -- waits for the crowds response. Standing in front of the sign shushing the backstagers he hears the applause. We only see it ""The Artist"" being a silent film (or nearly) whose story begins in the late-silent era. When Valentin takes his bow with his co-stars female and canine its clear this mans oxygen is the love of a crowd.""The Artist"" exists also to be loved. Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius (pronounced Ha-zahn-a-vish-us) has made a beguiling jape that takes this fictional character an amalgam of Douglas Fairbanks Sr. John Gilbert and Gene Kellys Don Lockwood from ""Singin in the Rain"" and presents him with every obstacle he can muster. The fickleness of the publics changing taste; unemployment; a broken heart pushing him to the brink of tragedy. And then after weve been through the wringer a tap duet and out.No wonder American audiences arent quite sure what to expect from the French import that premiered triumphantly at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and has topped a majority of stateside critics prizes this month. Is ""The Artist"" a screwball comedy? A sentimental melodrama? A spoof? Serious? What? Yes yes yes and yes. We may see Dujardin on the receiving end of an Academy Award come February. We may see Hazanavicius as well. Theres also a wonderful dog played by a Jack Russell terrier named Uggie who costars with Dujardin in Valentins swashbuckling adventures and is excellent indeed life-saving company off screen.""The Artist"" is a pastiche with heart sincere and rangy (too rangy in some ways). At the top of his profession Valentin meets eager would-be starlet Peppy Miller played by Berenice Bejo. She dreams of success and as her stock rises at Kinograph Studios -- John Goodman glowers and grins as the combustible studio head -- Valentins stock plummets. He refuses to adapt to the onset of the talkies. He puts all his money into one last vanity showcase darker in hue than his usual exotic diversions and pays for it. But just when things look blackest. ...Corny all the way. I have a few problems with ""The Artist"" some of them wonky and period-specific. For one thing the film puts no real priority on being period-specific (it spans 1927 to the early 30s). Filmed in squarish silent-film 133 ratio Hazanavicius goes only so far in framing and propelling a given scene in a way evoking any particular filmmakers of the day even the films acknowledged influences including the lushly cinematic romances of Frank Borzage. ""The Artist"" jumps around stylistically and tonally and its use in the dramatic climax of Bernard Herrmanns epic ""Vertigo"" score seems like a mistake. While many of the great late silent-era films were all over the place in their emotional content the swing here from effervescent parody to stark borderline-masochistic tragedy is more of a lurch.So thats whats wrong with ""The Artist"" which hardly gets in the way of whats right. Dujardin found big success in Europe with Hazanavicius on their ""O.S.S."" James Bond spoofs (Austin Powers-y but more sophisticated) and its no surprise Dujardin and his zillion-dollar smile fall so effortlessly into this setting. The surprise is that the actor brings such sound dramatic instincts to the later passages (which can get a little pokey) detailing Valentins ""Star is Born"" bottoming-out. Bejo makes Peppy peppy of course but shes winning and honest in both the characters self-regard and her innate decency. James Cromwell is spot-on as Valentins loyal chauffeur as loyal in his way as Uggie is in his.My favorite scene comes just when we must invest fully in the love story if ""The Artist"" is to amount to more than a gimmick. It is a series of takes on a movie set wherein Dujardin and Bejo are seen playing around enjoying each others company and then miraculously falling in love. ""The Artist"" comes back to this footage later fruitfully. The musical score by Ludovic Bource doesnt need the help from Herrmann and other sources; its beautiful on its own and when the best of Bources themes (""Comme une roseie de larmes"") underscores the pathos well ... between that and Uggie I was more or less in the bag. The PG-13 rating is faintly ridiculous.

How can this seemingly deliberately placed cameo go so glaringly unnoticed? Justin Hsaid on Friday July 27 2012 82742 PMI enjoyed watching The Artist but I can understand why most moviegoers were turned off. It is a completely different viewing experience than what we are used to. I get the artistic choices to use the 1.371 aspect ratio and mono sound. They were trying to emulate the viewing experience of a 1920s silent movie. However I think the movie would have been more accessible if done in the more normal 1.851 (flat) aspect and with a 5.1 sound mix. Ill even go so far as to say doing it in color rather than black and white might have roused the interests of more people. That being said I thought The Artist told a wonderful story. Although I was constantly distracted by how different the viewing experience was I am glad I gave the movie a chance.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 09 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 239PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English My The Artist is delightful ingenious funny poignant and in its own small way profound. Put Oscar on high alert but first this preface. We all know the old tale about the silent film star who unable to make the transition to talkies falls into boozy decline and eventual obscurity - technology claiming another inflexible victim. Set in such a distant past it used to seem a quaint tale more amusing than cautionary. Movies The Artist The official trailer But todays high-tech world has given that old saw some fresh teeth. Now lots of once-venerable institutions and the folks who inhabit them are feeling the pain of that haplessly silent actor faced with rapidly evolving technology that liberates and enslaves but either way issues a non-negotiable demand Learn and adapt or fade into irrelevance and die. On the bright surface of things The Artist seems like just a clever gimmick - beautifully wrought and with dollops of charm yet still a gimmick. You see it dusts off the yarn about the silent-film victim and retells his story - but does so silently in black and white. Although theres abundant music and the occasional intertitle nary a word of dialogue is spoken. Actually I lie. The vow of silence is broken twice each time for a brief second and to pointed effect but all the rest is a pure throwback. The result then is a silent film that dramatizes wonderfully the inevitable demise of silent film - that is a picture that uses old technology to dazzling effect to illustrate the insistent conquest of a new technology. Its like encountering a Proustian tome about Twitter. Suddenly the charming gimmick seems to cut more deeply and closer to home. Thats not to deny the charm. Shooting on location in Hollywood French director Michel Hazanavicius opens with a note of heightened artifice Back in the twenties George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is watching the premiere of his latest silent hit. The movie is playing on a big screen before an audience in a classic theatre as he and his cast wait in the wings to make their appearance. With his pencil mustache dazzling smile and roving eye Valentin is riding high - hes John Gilbert before the fall. Early on that eye roams in the direction of the aptly named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) an energetic chorus girl whose introduction comes courtesy of a lovely sight gag. The lens shows her dancing but only from the waist down - yes her legs do all the talking. Soon she has a small part with Valentin in his next picture and we see them shooting the scene in multiple takes while cracking each other up. We also see something far more interesting. Both Dujardin and Bejo are acting one way mugging theatrically for the film within a film and in quite another fashion perfectly naturally when the camera stops. The difference is vast and yet entirely achieved without the benefit of words - its a fascinating lesson in mute performance. Their paths part and 1929 arrives along with the new talkie technology. They meet again by chance on the staircase at the studio when of course shes going up the steps and hes coming down. That nice little visual touch paves the way for the obvious. A star is born in Peppy while Valentin is poised to flame out although not before losing his personal fortune in a desperate attempt to make a ""great silent movie."" By then his marriage is over (in an amusing bit of irony a title card has his wife complaining ""We have to talk"") his mansion is gone his possessions are auctioned off and hes hitting the bottle hard. Only a trio of loyalists remain - faithful butler Clifton (James Cromwell) best friend the Jack Russell terrier and Peppy who intercedes with quiet discretion. Still the slope just gets more slippery. Clearly all this is unabashed melodrama flecked with comedy which is precisely the genre that predominated in the silent era (and beyond with Chaplin). Within that genre Hazanavicius reminds us how easily the narrative can be advanced strictly with the camera even as the principals especially Dujardin prove again how much nuanced emotion can be expressed by the human face in close-up. Dont get me wrong. This movie isnt arguing (as some sentimentalists do) that the advent of talk was a step backward in the history of cinema. Instead The Artist is simply insisting and offering itself as immaculate proof that silence has its own merits and its own eloquence. So dont be daunted - revel in the homage to the past and heed its tiny warning in the present. Then as now a new technology emerges as irresistible and dynamic reshaping the medium completely. But then as now the old ways havent outlived their usefulness - they just seemed to for a while.

"Silent film The Artist is a multi-genre standout |       NJ.com comments Silent film The Artist is a multi-genre standout Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 25 2011 at 700 AM View/Post Comments The Weinstein CompanyJean Dujardin plays silent film star George Valentin in ""The Artist."" Pronouncements are tricky things but its a safe bet that you will not see another movie this year like ""The Artist."" Its not only a French film about the silent movie days of Hollywood. It is a Jazz Age-style silent movie -- complete with a boxy screen ratio crisp black-and-white photography and corny title cards. And yet far from being a curiosity the sort of thing cinematic obsessives make for each other -- like Guy Maddins constructivist collages -- ""The Artist"" is very much a movie-movie with slapstick sentiment and even a big musical number. An awful lot of movie-mad thought has gone into it. But the result is a sweet and simple delight. Thats not surprising considering the people involved. Michael Hazanavicius and Jean Dujardin are the director-and-star team behind the recent ""OSS 117"" films pitch-perfect parodies of not only a fabled French hero but the entire mindset of popular Cold War spy movies. The delightful Dujardin returns in ""The Artist"" as a marvelously self-assured movie star George Valentin whose most popular character is a top-hatted secret agent. Hes a power at the studio -- powerful enough that he can guide a pretty starlet through her first picture. But hes not powerful enough to buck progress. Because when sound comes in Valentin wants nothing to do with it. Fans dont want to hear him talk he insists. They want to see him act Except that pretty soon the fans dont want to see him at all. And his discovery -- Miss Peppy Miller -- is the new toast of the talkies. Even casual fans can note the inspirations here from ""Singin in the Rain"" and ""A Star Is Born"" to the real-life decline of Greta Garbos great co-star and lover John Gilbert (a melancholy Peppy is even given the title card ""I want to be alone""). But more than simply name-dropping old favorites ""The Artist"" also says something about stubbornness and ego (look at the pretension in that title again) and about the dangers everyone faces when they refuse to see that their world is changing around them. The Weinstein CompanyJohn Goodman as Al Zimmer in Michel Hazanaviciuss ""The Artist."" Dujardin -- who may define insouciance -- is perfect as Valentin as is the directors wife Berenice Bejo as Peppy. And of course the great old advantage of silents is that we accept this French actor and this Argentine actress as Americans (although Dujardin has also seeded his cast with some familiar faces like John Goodman). And Hazanavicius has quite properly done this film in perfect retro style. There isnt a zoom or a hand-held shot in the entire picture. But there are leisurely establishing shots and careful crosscutting the seriously designed compositions only occasionally interrupted by an optical wipe. The movies changing moods -- which briefly turn quite dark toward the final half hour -- do take a bit of getting used to (although Chaplin used to mix up sentiment melodrama and low comedy too). And theres one peculiar musical touch -- a lift of about five minutes of soundtrack music from ""Vertigo"" -- thats simply jarring. But ""The Artist"" works not merely because its unique (and its unique not merely because it doesnt talk). It actually sends you out of the theater happier than when you went in -- and in an arguably interesting yet truly downbeat year for movies thats a rare and welcome treat. Ratings note The PG-13 is a little harsh although the film contains some drinking and violence. The Artist (PG-13) Weinstein (100 min.) Directed by Michel Hazanavicius. With Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo John Goodman James Cromwell. Now playing in New York.

Starring Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo and John Goodman. Directed by Michel Hazanavicius. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In many ways - in all ways - ""The Artist"" is a profound achievement. A silent movie - or rather a sound film with a music soundtrack - it evinces such mastery of form that it could easily be mistaken for a real classic. Set in 1927 the movie is so meticulous it doesnt just look like a silent film but one from that specific year. In its cutting its degrees of light and shadow and its contrasting hues of black and white it is a product of serious study honest appreciation and love. Beyond the technical ""The Artist"" has the soul of a silent film. It has incidents and bits that evoke that ages sensibility - everything from a loyal dog to beautifully visualized moments of sober reflection and longing. Silent cinema depends on the poetics of the human body and spirit. Its a form that demands a gestural truth that is pointed and pure and does not allow for irony. It would have been a shame bordering on criminality had director Michel Hazanavicius and his cast taken things this far just to get cute and land the film in the zone of spoof. ""The Artist"" is the furthest thing from that. Jean Dujardin playing a silent-film idol doesnt just ape the movements; he gets into the consciousness of those days. His character is something of an amalgam of Douglas Fairbanks Valentino and John Gilbert and his smile is evocative of those men. Ever since talkies our pop culture heroes have smirked glowered and smoldered at us but in the silent days they never stopped smiling and in a very specific way. They smiled as if they really believed nothing bad could ever happen to them. But of course it could and it did. Related Stories Silence is golden in The Artist Review The Artist And so we meet George Valentin (Dujardin) in that crucial year 1927 when he is on top of the world a screen lover and action-adventure hero known for his acrobatic swashbuckling and an amazing dog who follows him everywhere in movies and in life. George is a shameless showoff always on but theres nothing obnoxious about his vanity. Like Gilbert and other stars from this time he is a happy child secure in the worlds love. At his height he meets an aspiring starlet Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) and gives her a break. Then talkies arrive and his star starts sinking just as hers begins to rise. It is a measure of the sheer beauty of Dujardins acting that the sight of doubt creeping into his eyes should be so painful. Just as ""The Artist"" is a tribute to an earlier period of American film Dujardins work here is a tribute to every actor who ever had his heart broken. His discovery of his own unimportance his education in suffering is the human education and a story well suited to this most universal medium. Why does George not embrace talkies or at least give them a try? This question is ultimately answered but subtly and touchingly in the way a good silent movie would. To see ""The Artist"" is to realize how much movies have lost from having gained so much technical sophistication. Think about this Though shot in the United States this is in fact a French film. The co-stars Penelope Ann Miller (as the actors wife) and John Goodman (as a studio head) are American. But Dujardin Bejo and Hazanavicius are major names in the current French cinema. Yet the silence makes them universal so there is nothing foreign about them. In the end that is the tragedy ""The Artist"" is really exploring the death and extinction of a medium that brought the world together that everyone could experience in the same way never from the outside never as a stranger. With delicacy and originality it laments what went away. But it also performs a resurrection because in Dujardins performance we discover something extraordinary and lovely the first truly great silent film performance in about 80 years.

Hands down its one of the years best pictures.Given that its in black-and-white and a silent film to boot its hard to imagine just how this Oscar-buzzy novelty winged its way out of the larval stage. In a cultural climate so averse to the comforting blanket of quiet an oldfangled flick about young Hollywood seems as out of place as an Edsel hogging the fast lane on I-680. And while the NC-17 ""Shame"" opening Friday in San Francisco more vigorously pushes hot buttons with its frank sex scenes ""The Artist"" in a gentler way presents a riskier cinematic proposition.I mean cmon. A silent movie? Isnt that too quaint too fuddy-duddy in this CGI-fueled 3-D-crazy time? Absolutely not.Even moviegoers who savor epileptic edits beefy special effects and saucy put-downs could well find themselves entranced by this naturally sweetened big-hearted smooch to the cinema.The story is simple and timeless a variation on ""A Star Is Born"" only happier. Its ""Singin in the Rain"" minus well all that singing and talking. In the form of dashing-but-vain actor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius has created one of 2011s most intriguing characters a proud suave guy who gets broadsided by the talkies and the fleeting nature of fame. Advertisement In a 1927 Hollywood Valentin is an American idol and quite a moneymaker for movie-man Al Zimmer (John Goodman).But not all is happy at home where hes stuck in a dud of a marriage to the uptight Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) and receives more attention from his cute sidekick a pooch.His life begins to shift after a vivacious dancer -- the aptly named Peppy (Berenice Bejo) -- bumps into him at a film premiere and the rest soon becomes actress history. Peppy eventually lands a bit part on the set of Valentins latest where the two discover they are kindred spirits while filming take after take of a particular scene.Its one of this years loveliest cinematic moments played with playful tenderness and affection by Dujardin and Bejo. Once the talkies stake their claim the headstrong Valentins star burns out while Peppys shoots into the stratosphere where shes Americas new sweetheart.Will these two ever come together? Will Valentin surrender to the bottle and despair? And could Valentins loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) save him?From all this melodrama we demand Hollywood-happy answers primarily because of the charisma of the two leads who are stars overseas but unfamiliar to most Americans. Both are well-known in France although the Argentine-born Bejo has appeared in American films such as ""A Knights Tale"" with Heath Ledger.Dujardin and Bejo make beautiful movie magic on-screen their reactions and expressions speaking more loudly than words ever could.Bejos Peppy has a gift for physical comedy and as the camera falls in love with her so do we. Dujardin has the more difficult role to navigate as his happy-go-lucky Valentin twirls into depression.With his dashing smile and Errol Flynn good looks Dujardin looks and acts like he just walked off a 1920s silver screen. Its easy to see why he won the best actor trophy at this years Cannes Film Festival.Director Hazanavicius (""OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies"") who wrote and co-edited the film gives each actor the tools for great performances.He has created a destined-to-be-classic silent film not by copying and pasting scenes from the masters but by capturing their texture and tone.And even though his film pays loving tribute to the genre this is no rehash.It creates its own romantic and moving vision with a few surprises up its sleeve.Hes supported by a talented team that includes director of photography Guillaume Schiffman production designer Laurence Bennett costume designer Mark Bridges and music director Ludovic Bource.All play essential roles in pulling off a bubbly confection that makes you want to skip out of the theater as the credits roll.

The Artist is slight but enormously likable and destined to win awards. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 30 2011 631 PM The Artist Silent slight and enormously likable. By Dana Stevens Jean Dujardin and Missi Pyle in The Artist Photograph courtesy The Weinstein Co. The Artist a near-silent black-and-white film by the French director Michel Hazanavicius is essentially a novelty item but none the less captivating for that. Think of this retro-styled romantic comedy as the movie equivalent of a mint-condition Art Deco cigarette case picked up on a lucky day at the flea market. Days after first discovering it youll be taking it out of your pocket to admire its cunning design and silvery luster. This slight but enormously likable picture seems destined to be an awards magnet A holiday release with enough formal sophistication to appeal to cinephiles and enough old-fashioned showbiz bravado to win over a general audience. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The films story structure echoes the classic A Star Is Born Hollywood romance with its opposing trajectories of fame George Valentin (the impossibly charming Jean Dujardin) a dashing silent actor in the Douglas Fairbanks mode sees his career decline with the advent of sound while a plucky upstart named Peppy Miller (gangly beauty Berenice Bejo whos also the directors wife) ascends to flapper stardom a la Clara Bow. The first line we hear George Valentin speak--or rather see him speak in a curlicue-bordered intertitle--is ""I wont talk I wont say a word"" As it turns out George is on a movie set speaking in character as a hero refusing to reveal information to his captors. But his words soon prove prophetic When hes shown a ""talkie"" test reel by his hard-nosed producer (John Goodman) George dismisses the new technology as a passing craze. Eventually he leaves the studio to bankroll his own silent productions a failure we witness in a making-of montage with frequent dissolves to a hand writing thousand-dollar checks. Advertisement The second act of the movie chronicles Georges decline into genteel poverty and borderline alcoholism (his addiction is less fun than Nick and Noras but never as grim as Ray Millands). He moves from his lavish mansion to a modest house after hes abandoned by his wife (Penelope Ann Miller) a sad-eyed blonde bombshell who seems fashioned after the second Mrs. Charles Foster Kane. But even at his lowest point George retains the loyalty of his longtime valet (James Cromwell acquitting himself admirably as always) and his dog (a short-haired Jack Russell terrier gamely embodied by canine players Uggie Dash and Dude.) The ingenue-turned-diva Peppy Miller who as a bit player once shared an unexpectedly romantic onscreen moment with George tries to find him work as a second banana in her movies but will this long-silent actor be too proud to accept? The Artists plot is a deliberately unoriginal backstage melodrama. Its affecting enough to draw us into the movie (and to remind us of the old movies this one both teases and venerates). But what keeps us in the movie is whats happening on its playful shimmering surface. Hazanavicius is constantly turning form into content and vice versa When George has a nightmare about the coming of the sound era we suddenly begin hearing the banal noises of daily life a dog barking a vase set down on a table. Later as he stands in front of a screen where hed been drunkenly projecting his old silent films Georges own shadow gets disgusted with him and walks out--the simplest of old-school special effects but eerily effective all the same. There are too many of these nimble cinematic sleights-of-hand to catalogue here and discovering them is the films chief pleasure so Ill desist. For all of its narrative and visual delights The Artist drags a bit in the last third Georges downward trajectory takes a few too many downturns to be credible and the movie starts to slip toward the maudlin (not to mention the overly long). When things do turn around for George (and I dont think its giving away too much to say that this light romantic comedy doesnt end in bleak despair) the plot threads get wrapped up a bit too hastily. The last shot has some of the forced claustrophobic happiness of a lesser MGM musical a cinematic reference that may not be intentional. The movies climactic sequence also features an inexplicable and to me unnerving appropriation of something from an earlier film. As a distraught Peppy leaps into her roadster and speeds to Georges side Ludovic Bources lovely supple original score is suddenly supplanted by a solid five minutes of the love theme from Bernard Herrmanns Vertigo score. This isnt an homage or pastiche of the famous Herrmann motif (itself a reworking of a theme from Wagners Tristan und Isolde). Its a straight-up lift duly acknowledged in the credits. For anyone familiar with the Hitchcock classic (which for a movie-lovers movie like this must be a significant chunk of the audience) the music takes you straight out of The Artists world and deposits you in a San Francisco hotel room where Kim Novak is showing Jimmy Stewart her new hairdo. The association with the original is so strong that hearing the theme only points up the distance between that movies emotional heft and this ones amusing but undeniable lightness. But maybe this clunky misstep stands out all the more given that for most of this clever and delightful film Hazanavicius navigates old-Hollywood tropes with the nimbleness of Fred Astaire on roller skates.

Its that kind of movie a cheeky trifle whose present-day novelty of being well silent and black-and-white carries it a long way. Fans of the OSS 117 films wont be surprised as writer-director Michel Hazanavicius and star Jean Dujardin give 60s spy romps a break and take equally enjoyable aim at the more earnest musicals and melodramas of the 20s and 30s. The result is similarly dead-on in its replication of an era with a core of sincerity replacing the proud silliness of their earlier collaborations. Dujardin plays George Valentin a beloved silent film star in the Douglas Fairbanks/Rudolph Valentino/William Powell mold complete with an adorable Jack Russell terrier counterpart. At the aforementioned premiere of his latest adventure he literally bumps into a peppy fan named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) and puts on a show for the attending photographers. Georges wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) isnt happy one bit and hasnt been for some time but Peppy is overjoyed to work her way up the ranks of Hollywood stardom and right into his heart. However she and others are more willing to embrace the coming wave of ""talkies"" whereas Georges pride -- combined with economic folly and ensuing misfortune -- gets the better of his career. Hazanavicius essentially combines the plots of Singin in the Rain and A Star is Born threading them together with callbacks to Citizen Kane here and Sunset Blvd. there though none of those were in fact silent films. But if thats the road map to old-fashioned delights then so be it. Everyone appears to take to the form effortlessly -- John Goodman as a blustery producer James Cromwell as a faithful butler Missi Pyle as a preening star not to mention cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman and composer Ludovic Bource doing ace work from their end -- and whats more the chemistry between our dapper man and flapper girl transcends the (mostly) sound-free gimmick. Dujardin retains that killer smile but his bravado plays off Bejos moxie to splendid effect; the early sequence in which they fall for one another through a series of flubbed takes is a moment of bliss and the climactic collaboration (dont act so surprised to see them reunited) rivals it for sheer delight. When the going gets predictably tough in between those two points each conveys their heartache loud and clear without vaulting over-the-top in the grand tradition of their predecessors and helps to alleviate Hazanavicius almost too strict adherence to conventional character arcs. Does The Artist have much more to offer than these consistently clever riffs on a familiar rise-and-fall formula and an old-is-new appeal? No but neither did the OSS 117 pictures. All reductive awards chatter aside its unlikely that well see this film dethroned as the years best bonbon and in this new-fangled loud-and-fast age of ours that should be comfort enough.

(/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 24 2011 1200 PM Title The Artist Film Info Directed by Michel Hazanavicius (140). PG-13 Peril. At the Paris Angelika. Every year brings an unexpected crowd-pleaser a seemingly modest indie that pushes aside the big-budget multiplex movies to capture the hearts of audiences. ""The Artist"" deserves to be that film this year. Of course its not enough to have an original idea It also must be done well. And Michel Hazanavicius has been successful on both fronts. Not only has he made a silent black-and-white romance in 2011 he has done it with much humor and style. ""The Artist"" should appeal to anyone willing to take a chance. Youll certainly be rewarded thanks in large part to lead Jean Dujardin who turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as 1920s film star George Valentin. The New York Daily News published this article on Nov. 25 2011. (New York Daily News) Valentin has the charisma and confidence of an icon which he is when the movie begins. But its 1927 and Hollywood is beginning the shift to talkies. This leaves a matinee idol like him out in the cold just as younger actors like Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) are ready to take over. While Bejos performance is too modern and knowing John Goodman James Cromwell and Penelope Ann Miller do strong work in supporting roles. Still this is really Dujardins show. He captures perfectly both the easy confidence of a revered star and the shaken insecurities of the recently deposed. Hazanavicius does a marvelous job depicting a Golden Age atmosphere in which anything is possible. Hes madly in love with the potential of cinema and he successfully shares this sense of awe and inspiration with his lucky audience. In this film a single word is worth more than all the expensive effects imaginable.

It requires a clever director to know how to use an absence of sound to achieve something transcendent. It takes a supremely gifted filmmaker to create an entire movie in which silence is consistently a virtue.In a time when movies often are sonic assaults and meaning can be lost amid the clatter of explosions gunshots and screeching cars The Artist ( out of four) has an utterly beguiling purity.VIDEO See the trailerFrench director Michel Hazanavicius has fashioned an ingenious period piece set in the late 1920s filmed entirely in black and white sans dialogue. The soaring score is ideally suited to the material punctuating witty scenes and augmenting poignant ones.Drama comedy action and romance are intertwined in this gorgeously photographed and brilliantly directed film. Lead performances are thoroughly engaging despite -- or perhaps because of -- being wordless.About the movieThe Artist     out of fourStars Jean Dujardin B?r?nice Bejo John Goodman James Cromwell Penelope Ann Miller Director Michel Hazanavicius Distributor Weinstein Co. Rating PG-13 for a disturbing image and a crude gesture Running time 1 hour 0 minutesOpens Friday in select citiesJean Dujardin is a joy to behold as silent film star George Valentin. His name could not be more fitting since The Artist is a love letter to classic Hollywood movies.When the story opens in 1927 Valentin is one of the eras top stars blending the smolder of Rudolph Valentino and the swagger of Erroll Flynn. Off-screen George is a good-natured guy despite a chilly home life with his disdainful wife Doris (Penelope Ann Miller). Doris has little use for George and quietly demonstrates it by blackening the teeth on every newspaper photo of her husband that she sees. Talk about passive-aggressive. Fortunately for George he has the devotion of his charming Jack Russell terrier (Uggie) who is unequivocally this mans best friend.An unexpected meeting with an effervescent young fan named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) makes an impression on George. Their paths cross soon after she is cast as an extra in his movie. They have visible chemistry in a sweetly funny dancing scene and Peppys luminous smile leaves George reeling.But the matinee idols days headlining the marquee are numbered. Talkies take Hollywood by storm and George becomes old news. Meanwhile Peppys star is on the rise. Then in 1929 the studio he works for stops production on all silent films and the stock market crashes rendering George broke. His wife leaves him. Peppy embodies the new order. The former flapper adapts easily to the world of talking pictures. In a lovely scene Peppy goes to see Georges self-financed last film and is visibly moved. George pops into the far more crowded theater to watch Peppy on screen and is delighted by her performance. A romance looms. But George must first find his way out of a demoralized state.Dujardin and Bejo are mesmerizing both masters of physical comedy with exquisitely expressive faces. The Artist is an inventive visually eloquent and joyously intoxicating celebration of movies. Be prepared to emerge from this enchanting film inclined to do the happy dance the stars perform so charmingly. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"A glorious silence to The Artist Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review The Artist a love note to the moviesFrench filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius film is a delightful throwback to Hollywoods early days when actors used their faces not dialogue to convey the story. It manages to be both witty and convey the spirit of bygone days.November 25 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Artist"" is the wonder of the age as much a miracle as ""Avatar"" though it comes at things from the totally opposite direction. Far from embracing the most modern cinematic techniques ""The Artist"" is a glorious throwback a black-and-white silent movie that manages the impossible It strikes an exact balance between the traditions of the past and the demands of the present managing to be true to the look and spirit of bygone times while creating the most modern kind of witty and entertaining fun. Look on this work ye mighty of Hollywood and rejoice. ""The Artist"" is no cynical pastiche no glib and mocking reworking of old-fashioned tropes. It combines delightful humor and charm with what movies at their best have always conveyed the honest power of pure emotion. It is a movie love story and a love note to the movies all at the same time. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this story of a successful Hollywood silent star confronting the coming of sound is that the creative team behind it is French. The film was shot by an American crew in historic Los Angeles locations with American costars such as John Goodman and James Cromwell and English language intertitles but ""The Artist"" was conceived of and brought to life by French writer-director Michel Hazanavicius. Best known in France for his pair of espionage spoofs ""OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies"" and ""OSS 117 Lost in Rio"" Hazanavicius brought only cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman and his two stars Jean Dujardin and BA(c)rA(c)nice Bejo with him on his Hollywood adventure. A director with a deep understanding of silent cinema who talks knowledgeably about F.W. Murnau King Vidor and Frank Borzage Hazanavicius had wanted to make a project like this for years. ""A silent film is a very special experience"" he said in Cannes where Dujardin went on to win the best actor award. ""It is not intellectual its emotional. You take it in the way you take in music. There are times when language reduces communication when you feel you are losing something when you start talking."" Key to the success of ""The Artist"" is the work of its two French stars. Dujardin and Bejo bursting off the screen like irrepressible Roman candles give performances that are both subtle and incandescent reminding us of the truth of silent star Norma Desmonds famous ""Sunset Blvd."" line ""We didnt need dialogue. We had faces."" It is the face of star George Valentin we see first defying the villains that are torturing him in ""A Russian Affair"" and insisting ""I wont talk I wont say a word."" Soon enough our hero manages to escape with the aid of his trusty dog and declaims ""Long live free Georgia"" as he flies off to freedom. That film within a film is playing to two audiences the people in the theater at its 1927 premiere and George himself watching from the wings with studio boss Al Zimmer (Goodman) and as entranced with himself as any fan. So much so that he is barely willing to introduce costar Constance (Missi Pyle) when the film is over. As played by Dujardin George is definitely the Ham What Am but in the sweetest possible way. Inspired by athletic silent star Douglas Fairbanks George has a brio and a complete beaming joy in performance that is infectious and inescapable. Plus he has a rapport with his Jack Russell terrier sidekick that is the stuff of legend. Stopping outside the theater to sign autographs for his mobs of adoring fans George quite literally bumps into one of them an energetic young woman appropriately named Peppy Miller (Bejo). Its a classic meet-cute that finds its way onto the front page of the next days Variety with a headline wondering ""Whos That Girl?"" That girl as it turns out is a dancer and aspiring actor who gets cast as an extra in Georges next picture ""A German Affair."" (So much for silent film originality). The two keep bumping into each other on set a Bejo has a brilliant moment doing a pantomime with the stars empty suit jacket a but it seems fated to end there. George as a delightful homage to the breakfast montage in ""Citizen Kane"" illustrates is very much married to Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) and always under the watchful eye of chauffeur and man of all work Clifton (Cromwell). The cheerful Peppy keeps getting bigger parts and then comes 1929 and the game changer. Zimmer calls George into his office and shows him a test for sound pictures. ""Thats the future"" the studio chief says. ""If thats the future"" his star responds ""you can keep it."" While actors like Peppy embrace sound George resists it. ""Im not a puppet Im an artist"" he insists. His predicament and how Peppy comes to figure in it is the heart of what makes ""The Artist"" so memorable. With its echoes of everything from ""A Star Is Born"" to ""Singin in the Rain"" ""The Artist"" is right at home in its numerous Los Angeles locations which include Mary Pickfords house on Fremont Place the Bradbury Building the back lots at Paramount and Warner Bros. and the circa 1915 Red Studios on Cahuenga Boulevard in the heart of old Hollywood. It revives a lost art and makes it live for today and that is definitely something to be thankful for. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Artists two stars talkFebruary 2 2012Golden Globes honor international films definitive...January 15 2012The Scores The sound of silence in The ArtistDecember 8 2011Buzz is growing over a silent filmNovember 21 2011Cannes Film Festival Michel Hazanavicius takes a gamble on...May 17 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-the-artist-20111125,0,5928257.story?track=rss",200,theartist27,theartist,latimes

Literally the kind of movie they just dont make anymore Michel Hazanavicius French-sponsored charmer ""The Artist is a gorgeous black-and-white love letter to silent Hollywood with old-fashioned English intertitles and just a single line of audible (English) dialogue. An exuberant Jean Dujardin brilliantly plays George Valentin a dashing action star -- Douglas Fairbanks Sr. springs to mind -- who stubbornly refuses to act in talking pictures after they become the standard in 1929. Parting ways with his longtime studio boss (John Goodman) George produces and directs himself in a hilariously hokey silent jungle melodrama. The film bombs and Valentin loses practically everything -- including literally his shirt as well as a wife (Penelope Ann Miller) who mocks him -- following the stock market crash. Meanwhile Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) -- a fan he helped get a job as a movie extra after she kissed him outside a premiere -- has risen through the studio ranks to become an early-talkie sensation as a dancing flapper (a la Joan Crawford). She wants to help her former mentor but the proud George wont hear of it -- especially after she mocks silent-style acting in an interview. In a story thats closer to ""A Star is Born than ""Singin in the Rain"" George refuses Peppys overtures even after hes forced to reluctantly fire his fiercely loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) who has gone without a salary after a year. George whos been hitting the booze hard finally hits rock bottom and tries to kill himself by setting fire to his old films. I wont say more about the plot -- except to note that George still has a Jack Russell terrier who gives the greatest animal performance in a movie that I have ever seen. Dujardin -- who also starred in a couple of French ""James Bond"" spoofs for director Hazanavicius and won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival -- is a gifted physical comedian who is equally adept at pathos. He will likely be Oscar-nominated for a tour de force that tips his derby to silent comic titans Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. Argentinian actress Bejo (Hazanavicius real-life wife) seems a tad sophisticated for her role at least at the beginning. But she has an infectious smile a dazzling screen presence and a talent for dancing that becomes increasingly crucial to the films plot. Hazanavicius and his inspired cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman (working in the classic nearly square-screen size) have packed their film with loving homages including some wonderful period-style trick photography used to illustrate Georges drunken hallucinations. Film fans will especially appreciate the films elaborate beautifully executed montages. The late 1920s/early 1930s mood is underlined by Ludovic Bources playful score. Its a mystery though why somebody decided to drop in a huge chunk of Bernard Herrmanns love theme from ""Vertigo -- besides being anachronistic it temporarily took me totally out of the movie. All that said I am not as bullish on the Best Picture chances of ""The Artist (which was filmed at well-selected locations in Los Angeles) as some one of my fellow Oscar watchers. Like Martin Scorseses ""Hugo its the sort of film that will likely play to a select but very very appreciative audience of film lovers.

See it and find out Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics France Movies Our Picks The Artist Entertainment News Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo in ""The Artist"" When French director Michel Hazanavicius new film ""The Artist"" premiered last spring at Cannes Harvey Weinstein snatched up the United States rights and a handful of prognosticators pronounced it an Oscar candidate. That sounded far-fetched at the time and maybe still does. But save your derision until after you see the movie a project so idiosyncratic so unlikely so simultaneously innocent and sophisticated that it could only have been devised by the French. Furthermore ""The Artist"" is also an outrageous and nearly impossible amount of fun which is not a concept Americans much associate with French films -- and thats the factor that may put the movie and its lantern-jawed meta-handsome leading man Jean Dujardin in this winters awards race.Unless youre a fan of the alternate film universe that is French comedy and specifically the recent ""OSS 117 spy spoofs youve never heard of either Hazanavicius or Dujardin. But the qualities that would seem to make their movie supremely unmarketable are also its strengths. ""The Artist"" is in black-and-white. Its not merely a silent film -- well at the risk of issuing a spoiler lets say its almost a silent film -- but one that both imitates and spoofs the Silent Age dramas of the late 1920s movies that hardly any living people have actually sat through. Thats at least three strikes against the film possibly four or five -- but ever since that Cannes premiere audiences at festivals around the world have responded to ""The Artist"" rapturously and uproariously. Not everyone will like it that much undoubtedly but if you do its the kind of movie youll tell all your friends about and drag them back to see if they seem reluctant.""The Artist"" of the title is a huge silent-era star named George Valentin played indomitably by 39-year-old Dujardin sailing into the winds and tides of 1920s Hollywood with his ships figurehead of a face. In Hazanavicius giddily postmodern ""OSS 117 movies Dujardin plays Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath the chauvinistic xenophobic and generally clueless 1960s superspy whos like the Gallic bad conscience of James Bond (and seems to have unresolved and unconscious sexual-identity issues to boot). An irresistible presence both on-screen and in person -- he had the Cannes press corps eating out of his hand -- Dujardin has jokingly described himself as the poor mans Sean Connery which is funny but not entirely fair. Hes more like the Monty Python version of Connery or Connery cranked to 11. Dujardin doesnt speak much English which may be the only thing thats kept Hollywood scouts away from him so far. After this performance Im pretty sure that any agent in the business would happily spring for any combination of Berlitz and Rosetta Stone in which hed care to partake. You Might Also Like With his jutting jaw sleek hair and pencil-thin mustache Dujardins George comes uncannily close to Douglas Fairbanks and like him dominates the silver screen as a series of dashing adventurers in nearly identical international espionage scenarios which Hazanavicius recaptures in delicious and affectionate detail. George has a beautiful wife an enormous house in the Hollywood hills and a loyal dog who co-stars in his films (and who will provide any number of ""awww"" moments later on). He has a minor flirtation with an up-and-coming flapper-flavored extra named Peppy Miller (the irresistible Berenice Bejo). In giving Peppy her first break he never foresees that she will soon surpass him. Georges studio is overseen by an avaricious exec played by John Goodman (who would have been huge in the silent era based on this evidence) who has to break the grim technological news The talkies are coming in and George is yesterdays copy of Photoplay.True to his naive and optimistic nature George believes that the public loves him and that talking pictures are a shallow fad. Sic transit gloria mundi bub. ""The Artist"" is perhaps less deliriously enjoyable after it switches from its early romantic-comedy mode to the ensuing Theodore Dreiser-style melodrama of Georges fall into alcoholism bankruptcy and disaster. (While Peppy of course becomes Americas borderline-insipid sweetheart.) But that too is very much in the spirit of the movies it emulates which packed two or three genres into a single picture. Hazanavicius loads the picture with laughs charm and surprises along with glorious Los Angeles locations. Ive got three words for you Tap-dancing numbers. I said tap-dancing numbers (Or is that really just two words?) ""The Artist"" finishes with a terrific bang and positively bursts with affection for an era of American cinema and culture that Americans have all but forgotten. (Hazanavicius could have used an actual American on set during the shoot Some of the English intertitles and supporting materials -- magazine and newspaper articles -- are either unconvincing or flat-out wrong.) In the long and fraught history of Franco-American cultural relations this movie is more than a peace offering; its a loving goofy joyous French kiss.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 23 2011 Save for later Saved Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo go cheek to cheek as George Valentin and Peppy Miller in The Artist a sweet and authentic film that ultimately falls short. The Weinstein Company/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of A s someone who bemoans the marginalization among moviegoing audiences of our great silent-film heritage I wish ""The Artist"" a new black-and-white French film that is almost completely silent nothing but the best. At least in theory I do. I hope it encourages people to go back and revisit or in many cases visit for the first time the glorious wealth of silent cinema available on DVD. But as adept as ""The Artist"" is at recapturing the feeling of the early Hollywood silents its essentially a faux silent film - a stunt.Pencil-moustachioed matinee idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) hale and limber is in the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks mold with a bit of Rudolph Valentino and John Gilbert thrown in. We first see him in 1927 emoting in an action-adventure movie-within-a-movie. Then the houselights inside the movie palace playing the film come up and we move outside to the red-carpet premiere where aspiring actress Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) captures his eye and eventually a small part in his next film. She also captures his heart although he remains tethered to his exasperated wife (Penelope Ann Miller).Peppy is equally smitten with George but writer-director Michel Hazanavicius is careful to portray her in virginal tones. Her love for George though she might have hoped otherwise is platonic. As her star rises his falls. Unable to cope with sound films George sinks his own money into an expensive silent flop then gets finished off by the Depression. He ruefully dismisses his faithful chauffeur (James Cromwell). Forced to auction off his personal effects after his wife leaves him he takes up residence in a dingy apartment with only his adoring Jack Russell terrier and the prints of his films to keep him company. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In a symbolic act of despair he sets fire to those prints. Were it not for his intrepid terrier George would also have gone up in smoke. It is at this point that Peppy whose big hit is a film called ""Guardian Angel"" proves herself worthy of that title nursing George back to his senses - and his career. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Its a big beribboned heart-tugger of a movie and Dujardin who won the best actor award this year at Cannes is a charming mimic of silent-film physicality. He knows how to inhabit a role while also spoofing it. In the ""OSS"" comedies he made with Hazanavicius he was a poor mans Sean Connery - a fatuously dopey 007. In ""The Artist"" he conjures up Fairbanks and all the rest with such panache that its not a stretch to think he might actually have been a star back in the silent era. And Bejo a Brazilian actress who in real life is partnered with Hazanavicius has the fresh-faced incandescence that is the emblem of the great silent-movie maidens (Gaynor Gish et al).Still despite its sweetness and its adherence to period authenticity the silent-film conceit here began to wear on me. Hazanavicius is content to simply replay silent-movie tropes rather than refresh or rework them. Yes the film is projected in the correct aspect ratio of the silent era with occasional title cards inserted. It was shot on Warner Bros. sound stages and filmed at 22 instead of 24 frames per second for that slightly jerky effect. But its black-and-white look is too glossy for that era. (Its more redolent of the swankier 1940s and early 50s movies.) Hazanavicius also makes the mistake of piping in swelling music from Hitchcocks imperially doomy ""Vertigo"" of all films at a crucial point in the romance.""The Artist"" is full of homages to many other films. I suppose it will be fun for cineastes to pick out the references but not all of them - like the ones from ""Citizen Kane"" or ""Sunset Boulevard"" - are especially germane.My larger problem with ""The Artist"" is its essence. Hazanavicius has stated that silent films are all about music and feeling and sensations. The notion that silent movies are movies in their ""purest"" form - and therefore more ""artistic"" than movies encumbered by all that dialogue - is not one that I subscribe to. (For one thing too many of my favorite films have people talking in them.) But even if you agree with Hazanavicius what is there in ""The Artist"" that is so artistic? The film offers up a vision of the silent-film past that is essentially a stroll down memory lane. Those memories are concocted for audiences who regard the silent era if they regard it at all as a quaint precinct of bedewed sentimentality.So to return to my original question will this movie make people want to see the real deal? Will there now be a revival of Fairbanks classics? Will audiences seek out Chaplin Keaton and D.W. Griffith films? Will they clamor to see ""Sunrise"" and ""Greed"" and all the other great silents? If they do they might discover that there was a lot more to silent films at their height than you would ever guess from this amiable little homage that evaporates as youre watching it. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for a disturbing image and a crude gesture.)

The movies in their first several decades of existence had no soundtrack at all and millions of people still flocked to see them. So while Martin Scorsese tips his movie-nerd beret to special-effects pioneer George Melies in ""Hugo"" -- and while the major studios threaten to completely replace 35mm film with digital projection over the objections of repertory theaters and cinema lovers everywhere -- let us praise the mute and monochromatic delights of ""The Artist."" In his valentine to Ye Olde Hollywood and the era in which movies learned to talk writer-director Michel Hazanavicius goes all in making his film not just silent and black-and-white but also framed in the old 43 aspect ratio. (Back in the silent era that pesky soundtrack didnt occupy any real estate on the film strip.) Mind you ""The Artist"" isnt just a clever homage to old movies -- that would be fun for maybe 20 minutes. This is a charming sweet funny and sad tale of silent star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) who sees his career go into eclipse when talkies become the rage and of his discovery Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) who climbs the ladder to fame as her mentor begins to sink. And if this all sounds like ""A Star is Born"" crossed with ""Singin in the Rain"" it absolutely is -- with a little ""Sunset Blvd."" and even ""Citizen Kane"" thrown in for good measure. If youre gaga for old movies then youll certainly eat up ""The Artist"" with a celluloid spoon. From its dead-on recreations of 1920s Hollywood (and Hollywood movies) to its evocation of the great movie stars of yore youll swoon over Hazanavicius obvious affection for the subject matter. Whats most exciting about ""The Artist"" is that its a crowd-pleaser even if you arent steeped in film lore. As the old posters used to promise its got Comedy Romance Thrills (As well as one of the most charming trained dogs youve ever seen on the big screen.) Theres certainly a possibility that the low-key subtle charms of ""The Artist"" are going to be overpraised in some quarters whether by film critics patting themselves on the back for getting the references or by audiences whove never seen a silent movie before and think theyre watching the genre being invented before their eyes. (The same thing happened when people who had never watched a Tsui Hark or Sammo Hung movie saw ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and assumed that wire-work martial arts sprang out of Ang Lees head like Zeus giving birth to Athena.) Dujardin -- whos mostly unknown in this country but is a huge star in France for films like Hazanvicius cloak-and-dagger parody ""OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies"" -- looks and acts like the lost Fairbanks; his Jazz Age swagger feels completely natural and he inhabits the role so completely that its easy to believe were watching a performer from that era. And while Bejo brings her own radiance and can-do energy to her role as a plucky up-and-coming starlet she doesnt scan visually as an ingenue of the early talkies. Her appearance might have gotten her cast as what they used to call an ""exotic"" type but I didnt buy her as an above-the-title star of the era. It all boils down to her looks yes but in a silent movie the face is everything. Hazanavicius loads up the supporting cast with performers who look like theyre having a ball -- and who would have had solid careers in pictures even if theyd been born 90 years earlier -- including John Goodman Missi Pyle Beth Grant James Cromwell and Penelope Ann Miller. Ideally ""The Artist"" will be a gateway drug that will let contemporary audiences (kids and adults alike) know that silent movies can be hilarious moving scary exciting and just as entertaining as any of todays blockbusters. So if you or someone you know has always shied away from silents let ""The Artist"" show you what youve been missing. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Its a black-and-white silent film made in a lovingly exact imitation of the primitive technical style -- and elemental emotional sincerity -- of a 1920s title-card melodrama. Written and directed by the French filmmaker Michel Hazanavicius (though the movie is in English and set in Hollywood) The Artist is delightfully old-fashioned but its also poppingly contemporary with a puckish spark of self-awareness. As it opens were watching an audience watch a silent adventure film and in a funny way we spend the rest of the movie watching ourselves get swept up in conventions we can see through. The hero George Valentin is a silent-film superstar who is sitting on top of the world. Hes played by the wonderful Jean Dujardin who functions as a living breathing silver-screen artifact He resembles Gene Kelly but with an absurdly rousing sunbeam of a smile that marks him as a wholesome rogue in the Douglas Fairbanks mold. At his latest premiere Valentin is being interviewed when a fan from the surrounding throng spills onto the sidewalk and interrupts his photo op. Her name is Peppy Miller and shes played by Berenice Bejo whos quite an image herself gorgeous and wide-eyed like Parker Posey fused with Charlie Chaplin. Peppys accidental brush with fame gets caught by the papers which lands her a bit part in Georges next picture (their dance scene carries a hint of romantic destiny). This leads her to bigger and bigger roles until she is skyrocketing to stardom. And Valentin? His golden career is about to hit a brick wall namely the birth of talking pictures. In the new era people want new stars and Valentin finds himself an overnight washout. As his already icy wife leaves him and the stock market crashes The Artist pays homage to silent films like Sunrise in which good people meet pitfalls of degradation that can potentially bedevil all of us. The movie like a silent Star Is Born counterpoints Georges descent and Peppys rise though the affection between them is anything but spent. I do wish that the last act were truly wrenching instead of just mildly touching. Yet the ending is a madly exhilarating surprise. Days after I saw The Artist I was still thinking (and grinning) about it because the movies real romance is the one between us the jaded 21st-century audience and the mechanical innocence of old movies which here becomes new again.

Michel Hazanavicius steps beyond the self-conscious parody of his two ""OSS 117"" films for a bittersweet homage to the sweeping language of the silent screen. Just as sound technology had a destructive impact on the careers of existing silent stars ""The Artist"" resurrects its appeal without ever fully realizing the potential that inspired it. (This review was originally published during the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. The Weinstein Company opens ""The Artist"" this Wednesday November 23 in limited release.) ""You belong to another era"" says the cigar-chomping studio chief Al Zimmer (John Goodman) to handsome leading man George Valentin (Jean Dujarin) explaining his diminishing popularity. The year is 1927. As Al Jolson sing ""My Mammy"" for the end of ""The Jazz Singer"" sound is rapidly developing into the expected norm for audiences everywhere. Blinded by ego George ignores the warning and soldiers on while his star quickly fades. Meanwhile cutesy aspiring actress Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) made famous overnight when George sweeps her off her feet at a flashy premiere quickly inherits the new demands of the business and hits it big. When George eventually finds himself washed up and abandoned by his moody wife Constance (Missi Pyle) the sympathetic Peppy tries to help George find his footing again. On the surface ""The Artist"" is a simple romantic comedy with lavish production values and a charmingly lighthearted plot. But thats also its chief flaw ""The Artist"" is all surface. Although easy on the eyes it indulges in homage with no less gratuity than the references of your average Quentin Tarantino script. If the script had spoken dialogue in place of its anachronistic cue cards it would be a relentless bore. The gimmick saves it. Precedents exist for this type of project. Mel Brooks 1976 farce ""Silent Movie"" lovingly spoofed the cliches of silent film. Even Charlie Chaplins ""City Lights"" made in 1931 during the post-talkie period but defiantly silent mocked the arrival of sound film by giving the sole talking character in the opening scene an absurdly high-pitched voice as though he had been huffing helium. ""The Artist"" has nothing on Brooks well-honed gags or Chaplins convictions although its just as pretty to watch and not without its sentimental delights. The real star of the show is director of photography Guillaume Shiffman. If ""The Artist"" gains any commercial traction Shiffman ought to get the most of its success. Shooting in a 1.33 ratio and imitating the complex grey scales of innumerable silent traditions-from German Expressionism to the shadowy American noirs that came out of it-Shiffman provides the foundation for the movies appeal. With few exceptions Hazanaviciuss trim story can barely keep up. The best moments play with the impact that silent and sound techniques have on storytelling techniques George has a curious nightmare where the whole world turns vocal but he still cant speak. A climactic fake-out uses an ambiguous title card. And then theres the keenly analytical last shot when microphones finally open up to the full world of the movie set. Drawing out these distinctions ""The Artist"" tracks the creative possibilities of the art form in its early stages and how its influence continued into the Golden Age. (Hint It has something to do with dance.) Hazanavicius delivers an earnest love letter to the medium if not one substantial enough to avoid unflattering comparisons to its superior reference points. As Billy Wilder did with ""Sunset Blvd."" Hazanavicius observes a generational shift in the transition to sound that has deep cultural ramifications. (A young man tells George that his father is a big fan of the actors work.) However while Wilder examined how the end of the silents affected early stardom ""The Artist"" plays around with the distinction between silent and sound cinema resulting in the superficial entertainment value of a high concept film school joke. But its a charming and supremely gorgeous joke-sometimes too clever for its own good other times not clever enough and always at least an attractive diversion. HOW WILL IT PLAY? Purchased for U.S. distribution by the Weinstein Company ahead of Cannes ""The Artist"" has a shot at box office success in limited release if the company figures out a way to make its retroactive look seem cool to younger audiences. criticWIRE grade B+ This Article is related to Festivals and tagged Reviews More From IndieWireBoJack Horseman Brilliantly Argues Why Comedy Belongs in the Abortion DebateReview Vice Principals Charms With A-Grade Class Clowns But This VP Is No VeepReview Stranger Things is Still Waiting for Something New To Make It Feel AliveReview The Night Of Serial-izes Law amp; Order But Its All About The Verdict Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The first few seconds of The Artist contain pretty much everything youre afraid of in a black-and-white silent movie melodrama overacting nothing seeming remotely real. The first thing you see is a huge mouth moving silently and the titles ""I wont talk. I wont say a word."" Kind of on-the-nose right? But then the camera pulls back and you realize youre watching a guy being interrogated in a spy flick -- a movie within the movie -- at a star-studded 1927 premiere. The camera cuts from the crowded theater to behind the screen where the actors stand in evening clothes waiting to go out and take a bow. Theres star George Valentin who was being interrogated on screen his Jack Russell terrier and an actress he doesnt seem to think much of. As their interaction is intercut with the spy movie the differences register and your initial fears slip away. I mean the folks off screen are all silent and black-and-white too. But the film is already wrapping you up in a world where silence makes sense. That world is about to be disrupted for George both at the movies and in his personal life. Hell be knocked off stride first by ""talking pictures"" which hes convinced are just a fad and then by a pretty girl named Peppy. Shes an extra who is cast opposite him for a scene where you watch her youthful glow and hesitant smile catch both him and the camera. With talkies (and therefore musicals) coming in Peppys skill as a dancer is about to be much in demand. Georges skill at pantomime on the other hand wont be. So hes on his way down Peppys on her way up and in case you miss that director Michel Hazanavicius has them meet halfway on a staircase him dejected her just radiant. Now if you know something about silent movies youll be making all sorts of connections by this time. George as played by French actor Jean Dujardin is a cross between swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks and romantic lead John Gilbert who was known as ""The Great Lover"" until sound came in and audiences heard him saying ""I love you I love you"" over and over. i A silent-era superstar when we meet him George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) struggles to keep up after Hollywood falls in love with sound.

The Weinstein Co. Berenice Bejos Peppy meanwhile is channeling a lot of that eras pretty young things including Greta Garbo who fell for Gilbert while making one of her first American movies. Even Georges faithful mutt seems familiar -- a grand-uncle maybe of Asta from those 30s Thin Man movies. All of thats fun for those in the know. But what will lift this movie way above most of whats at the multiplex right now even for folks who arent silent-movie buffs is the way the director makes you a willing even an excited fan of this crazy old-fashioned thing hes doing. By the time the opening sequence is over youll have realized that in his hands silence is almost liberating. It heightens all things visual makes the jokes -- and The Artist is a very funny picture -- sort of pop and fizz even as its putting extra smolder into lovesick glances. Keep an eye out for movie marquees and posters on screen -- nearly every one of them will prompt a smile -- and be ready when the director decides to try an ingenious exception to his rule that silence is golden. The delighted gasps in the theater will make you glad you took a chance on The Artist. Silent black-and-white movies are not coming back but this one is such a rewarding labor of love by all of the artists involved that it just might make you wish they could.

It might also be the first silent film many of its viewers have ever seen.French writer-director Michel Hazanavicius who has previously struck gold by mining the past with his Bond-era spoofs (and Gallic box-office hits) OSS 117 Cairo Nest of Spies (2006) and OSS 117 Lost in Rio (2009) eases neophytes discomfort by creating the cinematic equivalent of an amuse-bouche (an amuse-oeil?). Although many of the technical aspects of the silent period are expertly re-created--shooting at 22 frames per second the boxy 133 aspect ratio--The Artists blithe presentation of the transition from sound to talkies is even less complex than the one found in Singin in the Rain.The film opens in 1927 when preening matinee idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin the lead in the OSS 117 capers) saluting his own life-size self-portrait in his mansion every morning is still the top draw at Kinograph Studios. Ignoring the increasingly icy glares his wife (Penelope Ann Miller) aims at him from across the breakfast table George acts as a mentor to Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) a chorine with big ambitions. Borrowing heavily from A Star Is Born (just as the score does rather incongruously from Bernard Herrmanns music for Vertigo) The Artist tracks both Peppys ascent (through amusing montage) and Georges decline as he refuses to acknowledge synchronized sound as more than a passing fad. By 1932 Peppys attracting lines around the block for her latest Beauty Spot while George spends his afternoons passed out on a barroom floor his Jack Russell terrier his sole remaining fan.Or so he thinks Peppy has never forgotten him and the films concluding act restores The Artists buoyancy. The movie pivots on the spry connection between the mute (save for one scene) Dujardin and Bejo both nimble performers elegantly turned out in period finery and pomade. If the charm offensive comes on too strong at times its the result of a ham playing a ham Dujardin who won the Best Actor award at Cannes seems incapable of not daring us to adore him constantly arching his brow and flashing his choppers--a surfeit of cute for a character already inspired by suave silent-era smoothies like Douglas Fairbanks. The Artist is movie love at its most anodyne; where Guy Maddin has used the conventions of silent film to express his loony psychosexual fantasias for more than a decade Hazanavicius sweetly asks that we not be afraid of the past.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet French director Michel Hazanavicius makes movies for movie buffs--up to a point. His two OSS 117 spy spoofs are packed with film references and direct parody; his latest the Cannes-acclaimed black-and-white silent feature The Artist consciously draws on decades of Hollywood features. But for viewers who will get all the in-jokes and call-outs the film may seem too familiar. Theres a fine line between homage and just repeating well-known stories. OSS 117 star Jean Dujardin (who won Best Actor at Cannes for this role) brings his usual million-dollar smile to the role of a silent-cinema star whos on top of the world until the advent of talkies which he dismisses as a fad leaving the world to pass him by. Meanwhile a starstruck fan he meets in a crowd (Berenice Bejo) rockets to stardom but never forgets her crush on him and continues to admire him from afar (and sometimes a-near) as he slides toward irrelevance. Hazanavicius scripts and directs broadly; as with classic silent features the emotions are meant to play clearly even without dialogue but even so Hazanavicius sometimes overplays his hand with lead-footed symbolism. One particularly obvious scene has Dujardin and Bejo stopping for a bittersweet conversation on a Hollywood studio stairwell; hes headed down and out of the building shes going up and in but they pause for a moment in the middle with him looking up soulfully at her newly lofty position. Later a shot of his latest movie poster lying discarded in the rain and being stepped on by oblivious passers-by offers a similarly corny summary of his situation. That said Hazanavicius never set out to be subtle; the opening shot of Dujardin playing the hero in a movie-within-a-movie being interrogated and stolidly proclaiming that the baddies cant make him talk ably lays out the films wink-wink self-awareness and sense of humor. As with the OSS films catching the many references is part of the fun The story meshes Singin In The Rain with A Star Is Born by way of Buster Keaton the soundtrack covers the gamut from silent classics to Alfred Hitchcock and even Dujardins ubiquitous cute-dog companion recalls The Thin Man. And by nature The Artist is a charming romance in which two naturally winning people are denied what they want just long enough to make audiences feel satisfied when everyones needs are finally met.

NEW YORK--The best validation for the nostalgia of ""The Artist"" is the film itself.A silent movie in tribute to silent movies ""The Artist"" puts its money where its mouth is so to speak. Or not to rather.Michel Hazanavicius black-and-white near-wordless film is a loving irresistibly charming ode to a long-ago movie era that not only summons the dormant conventions of silent moviemaking but makes them dance again.The film opens with old-style titles and the first bursts of Ludovic Bources spirited nimble score which (as in most silents) plays a starring role throughout. The camera pulls back on a man being electrocuted by captors.""I wont talk"" he says -- or so reads a title card. ""I wont say a word.""Its the first of many puns but its also Hazanavicius promise too. To make a silent film nowadays hes suggesting is to subject oneself to torment. But the French filmmakers boldness has already been much rewarded The film was feted at the Cannes Film Festival snapped up by Harvey Weinstein and is now considered a favorite horse in the Oscar race.The opening scene is merely a fiction within ""The Artist."" The man is silent film star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) -- a kind of Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckling matinee idol -- and this is the premiere of his latest hit ""A Russian Affair."" The year is 1927 and the packed auditorium greets the movie with a standing ovation and raucous cheers that we can only infer.The grinning mustachioed Valentin glides across the stage in a tuxedo basking in the adulation. A born entertainer he casually and eagerly keeps the audience in his thrall pantomiming tricks with his faithful sidekick on screen and off his Jack Russell terrier.The dog (Uggie) deserves credit here. Obviously raised on ""The Awful Truth"" and ""The Thin Man"" he puts shame to the digital Snowy of the upcoming ""The Adventures of Tintin.""But the good times are soon to end The Talkies are coming. When sound movies arrive Valentin finds himself squeezed out of the business that so recently championed him. (The particular reason for Valentins inadaptability is revealed later.)Kinograph Studios head Al Zimmer (John Goodman robbed of his booming voice but not of his character-filled face) is quickly transitioning to talkies and a new bevy of stars. Among them is Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) an upstart whose rise Valentin aided.Valentins fall is greased not just by irrelevancy but by the stock market crash and ego (he self-finances an extravagant belated silent film). Nearly destitute he has little left besides his dog and his loyal chauffer (James Cromwell).Miller always quietly enamored with Valentin ascends to stardom. Her ""Beauty Spot"" released on the same day as Valentins ""Tears of Love"" draws lines around the block. That their paths will finally align is of little surprise in Hazanavicius smart if predictable script.Naturally the image is the supreme element in a silent film (and a talkie too but thats another story). But ""The Artist"" is disappointing staid visually. Though its remarkably true in style and production (design by Laurence Bennett) it doesnt bear the visual flare that perhaps it should.Instead ""The Artist"" is propelled by its performances particularly Dujardins. He has an exquisite elegance and builds a whole movie with only his gestures. Its impossible to imagine ""The Artist"" without him the wellspring of its charm.But it doesnt take a masterpiece to remind us of the power of silent films. It most succeeds in this mission an altogether welcome whisper of ""Dont forget.""The most moving shots in ""The Artist"" are of audiences in the grip of a movie whether silent or not. Hazanavicius captures moviegoers collectively on their edge of their seats reacting in worry or laughter. Its this romance for the movies -- and the melancholy wistfulness for the silent era -- that makes ""The Artist"" affecting urging us to remember the simple captivating beauty of moving images in a theater.""The Artist"" a Weinstein Company release is rated PG-13 for a disturbing image and a crude gesture. Running time 100 minutes. Three stars out of four.------Motion Picture Association of America rating definitionsG -- General audiences. All ages admitted.PG -- Parental guidance suggested.

In a scene from one of his films George is being tortured in a villains dungeon and he shouts ""I wont talk. I wont say a word."" Actually he doesnt speak at all; his dialogue is shown in intertitles. And he doesnt need to talk. The year is 1926 and in just two decades silent films have blossomed from an arcade novelty to a huge worldwide business and the supreme new art of the 20th century. What could possibly go wrong for George and many other mute idols? Talkies. The popular hit of this years Cannes Film Festival whose jury gave Dujardin the Best Actor award The Artist pays eloquent tribute to Hollywood in the late 1920s when the silent films gave way to talking pictures. With an informed infectious fondness for his subject writer-director Michel Hazanavicius manages to embrace contradictions and then resolve them with supreme comic grace. Hazanavicius is French as are his stars Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo but they shot the movie in Los Angeles and all the dialogue is in English -- dialogue that until the last scene is never heard but rather mouthed or shown in intertitles. The result is a ""silent"" film (with Ludovic Bourses virtually nonstop symphonic score) in ""black-and-white"" (shot by cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman in color and then monochromed in the lab). (LIST The Top 10 Cannes Film Festival Movies) So a black-and-white silent movie do you want to see that? If you dont you will be missing the fizziest most endearing film in ages. The Artist is not just for geriatric cinephiles but for anyone of any age who wonders what happened to the cinemas old gift for creating pure joy. George Valentin (Dujardin) is a full-service silent-screen star action hero and glamour boy every mans ideal and every ladys crush. The blithe spirit of romantic heroism he bounds through his adventure scenarios flashing the grandly confident grin of the great 20s swashbuckler Douglas Fairbanks -- and of Gene Kelly who borrowed much of the Fairbanks elan for his character in Singin in the Rain that other superb homage to Hollywood in the handover from silents to talkies. George is one of the industrys most popular icons the pride and piggy bank of Kinograph Studios boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman). (MORE Read a Corliss tribute to Gene Kelly) Peppy Miller (Bejo) is a young flapper with dreams of stardom. Breaking the line at the premiere of Georges film she accidentally bumps into him -- the movies jazzier future colliding with its radiant present soon to be its past. He smiles she twitters and the next day the newspapers are headlining ""Whos That Girl?"" Soon enough Peppy will be the It Girl of movies a grinning mix of silent comediennes Marion Davies and Clara Bow with a premonition of Ginger Rogers. She has just that youthful verve that the movies will need when they start talking and sassy-mouthed comedies replace some of the sentimental melodramas of the silent era. For now though she is happy to secure a job as an extra in Georges next picture. Seeing Peppys dancing legs behind a half-raised curtain George imitates her steps. In a scene set in a dance hall he blows five takes just so he can keep returning to Peppy as his partner. She sneaks into his dressing room and in a lovely moment borrowed from Janet Gaynors silent romantic classic 7th Heaven she slips her arm into one of his jackets and imagines that he is caressing her. When George walks in he tells her that every star needs a trademark and dabs a beauty spot on her face. It will become her visual symbol as she rises to fame even as Georges dazzling smile freezes when his stardom dims to obscurity. She is a comic Garbo to his once-proud now-passe John Gilbert. (SEE How many silent films are on the All-TIME 100 Movies list?) Hazanavicius best known for the OSS 117 spy spoofs starring Dujardin and Bejo began his filmmaking career by co-directing a pastiche film La classe americaine which told a story using only clips from 30 years of Warner Bros. talkies. But the challenge he set himself here is even more audacious. Boasting a wit in story construction worthy of Billy Wilder or Preston Sturges the movie sets itself impossible goals and keeps meeting and exceeding them. A clever premise that could be nothing more than an idea for a comedy skit -- and was brilliantly on Your Show of Shows when Sid Caesar played a silent-film hero with a falsetto voice -- is magnificently sustained. No two stars could be more charming; and Dujardin expresses with astounding subtlety the emotional arc of a man sliding from the worlds rapturous acceptance to ignominy and anonymity. Bejo embodies the vitality of both her characters nickname and the more modern sass of the early-1930s pre-Code movies. James Cromwell is stalwart and sensitive in the role of the stars loyal servant; and Uggy as Georges pet terrier proves as resourceful a friend as Tintins Snowy. The pearly cinematography (darkening as Georges life starts to go black) and careful production and costume design put spectators instantly and deeply into this historical fantasy world. Beyond its craftiness and impeccable craft the film sparks a warm connection with the viewer. Like a smiling cavalier swinging into view to rescue an imperiled maiden The Artist brings salvation to melancholy movie lovers. For here is that rare film indeed that offers pleasure beyond words.

Black and White. French. Silent. What Isnt There to Like? One of the best films of 2011. And its not even a mime By Rex Reed  11/22/11 1059am Dujardin. Already the darling of film festivals  everywhere The Artist arrives on a crest of raves to kick off the holiday season in time to be justly heralded as one of the best films of 2011. A silent film from France about Hollywood? In black and white? I can see the eyebrows curl before the ink is dry. But get ready for a smash hit. Gimmicky but delicious this is a valentine to the movies I promise you will cherish. The standing ovations its been getting are well deserved. Its Singin in the Rain without the songs or the hilarious voice of Jean Hagen. The year is 1927 before silent movies were about to tank thanks to The Jazz Singer. A hammy good-looking matinee idol named George Valentin (welcome a magnetic new force named Jean Dujardin) is a big star at the top of his career. (Think Douglas Fairbanks cross-pollinated with Charlie Chaplin.) One night at the premiere of his new film an ambitious little flapper starlet named Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) literally falls into his arms by accident on the red carpet. The resulting paparazzi photos jump-start her career. What follows for the next 100 minutes of uninterrupted joy is a cross between the Don Lockwood-Kathy Selden (a.k.a. Gene Kelly-Debbie Reynolds) romance in Singin in the Rain and the Norman Maine-Esther Blodgett (a.k.a James Mason-Judy Garland) saga in Moss Harts classic screenplay for A Star Is Born. As her star rises his career diminishes. Suddenly he hears sound coming from everywhere except his own voice. Even his dog starts barking. Its a nightmare but the studio halts production on all silent films to usher in the dawn of a fad called talking pictures.  Withdrawing his savings in 1929 to finance a comeback Valentin hopes this innovation will pass but his silent film opens the same day as his proteges new talkie and the same time the stock market crashes  By 1931 hes wiped out his wife leaves him his fans forget him (think John Gilbert) he hits the bottle and fades into the shadows of Tinsel Town history with only two friends by his side--his funny acrobatic and forever-loyal Jack Russell terrier Uggie and his faithful servant Clifton (James Cromwell) from the good old days. Cue the violins. But wait Selling whats left of his possessions his Hollywood auction attracts the attention of Peppy Miller now the screens favorite It Girl who hasnt forgotten the accidental photo op that made her a star. Now its her turn to save him--in a full-sound MGM tap-dancing finale that leaves everybody cheering.  Its a familiar narrative but French writer-director Michel Hazanavicius (a name I cannot pronounce much less spell) pulls out all the stops embracing every trope of silent cinema with a crowd-pleasing resonance that is fresh and satisfying. This is amazing stuff from a French director but his obvious fascination with--and passion for--movie history ignites The Artist with a colossal entertainment value that speaks volumes in any language. Mr. Hazanavicius and his cameraman Guillaume Schiffman fully capture the mojo of the people the age and the power of an emerging industry. The cast is French but includes guest appearances by Malcolm McDowell Penelope Ann Miller and John Goodman that fit right in. The center ring is occupied at all times by Cannes Best Actor winner Mr. Dujardin an unconventional leading man with the Gallic charm and insouciant charisma of a young Maurice Chevalier. The Artist is so wonderful that the audience applauds everything including the dog. The director the actors and the crew may be foreign but when the forthcoming awards season rolls in dont be surprised if they become Hollywood royalty. rreedobserver.com THE ARTIST Running Time 100 minutes Written and Directed by Michel Hazanavicius Starring Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo and John Goodman 4/4 Comment Filed under Berenice Bejo Jean Dujardin Jean Hagen John Goodman Michael Hazanavicius movie Movie Review Silient Film Singin in the Rain The Jazz Singer Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2011/11/rex-reed-the-artist-french-silent-fil/,200,theartist41,theartist,observer

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The Artist is a total pleasure written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius with a keen eye for detail. French actor Jean Dujardin who collaborated with Hazanavicius on two OSS 117 spy satires is simply marvelous as George Valentin the dashing star of countless silent-movie epics. George resists the efforts of studio chief Al Zimmer (a wonderful John Goodman) to try talkies. Stuck in a loveless marriage George is sparked by Peppy Miller (Argentine beauty Berenice Bejo) a bit player who hits it big in the sound era while Georges career crumbles. Dujardins face is a resonant reflection of Georges subtitled rage (""Im the one people come to see. They never needed to hear me""). Only Clifton (the peerless James Cromwell) his driver and the stars dog Uggy (a scene-stealing Jack Russell terrier) stick with George through his fall. It takes Peppy - Bejo is dazzling in every particular - to save the man she loves. Its A Star Is Born blended with Singin in the Rain and yet somehow bracingly fresh. Credit the tantalizing magic of Hazanavicius who only twice breaks the no-sound rule (Ill never tell) and creates something unique and unforgettable. Gorgeously shot by cinematographer Guillaume Schiffman and with a vivacious score by Ludovic Bource The Artist encapsulates everything we go to movies for action laughs tears and a chance to get lost in another world.

By Anthony Lane Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo in a movie directed by Michel Hazanavicius.   Credit Illustration by Andy Friedman What happens in ""The Artist"" is simple enough. A film star by the name of George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) streaks across the Hollywood heavens in the late nineteen-twenties and then with the advent of sound gutters and falls. Only the love of a good woman has the power to relight his fuse. To movie nuts reared on ""Singin in the Rain"" ""Sunset Boulevard"" and ""A Star Is Born"" this film could hardly be more welcome; I would wager that its writer and director Michel Hazanavicius represents the final word in nuthood. But heres the rub the sportive twist that prevents his work from being a mere rehash of twice-told tales ""The Artist"" is not just about black-and-white silent pictures. It is a black-and-white silent picture. And its French. Two principles are in play here. One ""The Artist"" will cleave--far more loyally than Mel Brookss ""Silent Movie"" (1976) did--to the rules of the game supplying not just printed titles but a breathless musical score unblushing melodrama a bouquet of sight gags a girl with a kiss curl and a corpulent cop. And two Hazanavicius will toy with those rules in the Frenchest possible manner. The very first thing we see for example is an open mouth belonging to a man under interrogation. ""I wont talk. I wont say a word"" he says. Yet those words themselves go unsaid flashed up instead on a black screen. He couldnt talk even if he crumpled; everything in this world must be seen not heard. I am tempted to reveal the brief and brilliant exceptions that Hazanavicius provides even to that stricture but I too must keep quiet. There are notable bit parts in ""The Artist"" not least for John Goodman as a harrumphing bull of a studio boss and James Cromwell as a faithful chauffeur and helpmeet a sort of anti-Erich von Stroheim. Better still we get Uggy who plays Valentins no less constant mutt a barking echo of Asta the wirehaired genius of ""The Thin Man"" ""Bringing up Baby"" and ""The Awful Truth."" It is Dujardin though in his portrait of the artist as a dashing mute who best raises the ghost of an era. The two-second shot in which on set as the cameras roll Valentin locks into a brooding frown--the standby of the questing smolderer--earns a laugh for sheer precision and behind such face-making you sense a lot of homework. He has an oily dab of his compatriot Maurice Chevalier plus a stronger dose of Douglas Fairbanks including the neat yet unvillainous mustache and the elastic bonhomie joshing with camera crews as he does with reverent fans. The most acute reference however is to John Gilbert--a top lion at M-G-M in the mid-twenties but dead within a decade liquidated by drink and the lethal demands of speech. A crux of ""The Artist"" finds Valentin toiling on a scene in which he must revolve between partners on a dance floor. One fellow-waltzer is played by Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) a lithe young laugher into whom he has previously bumped. She is a nobody a casual extra except that when they grasp each other en passant and as take follows take she becomes imperceptibly a somebody. From the crucible of this moment indeed she will glow into a leading light in Valentins heart and a movie star in her own right. The gesture intended here I think is toward ""Flesh and the Devil"" the silent romance that Gilbert made with Greta Garbo in 1926. They too danced lightly but dangerously together and the motion led them as if hypnotized into a garden where they shared one of the fiercest and most fondant kisses in the history of movies or of mouths. Gilbert and Garbo like Valentin and Peppy fell in love for real or as real as Hollywood could allow. (""Flesh and the Devil"" shows at Film Forum on November 28th three days after ""The Artist"" is released. Try both on a moonstruck night.) Word of this tacit new film has spread since it showed at Cannes in May and much of its allure is due to the speed--eager and uncomplaining--with which you feel the audience innocents as well as buffs acclimatizing to its antiquated modes. Here is a crowd-pleaser that makes you glad to be part of the crowd perhaps because--to adopt the classical viewpoint--silent cinema really was the purest and most binding incarnation of the medium one from which we have torn ourselves to our detriment ever since. That is why ""The Artist"" seems instantly easy on the minds eye and why we feel a natural tug of resistance when Peppy the bright spark of sound declares to an interviewer ""Make way for the young"" What Hazanavicius has wrought is damnably clever but not cute; less like an arch conceit and more like the needle-sharp recollection of a dream. It is above all a Gallic specialty--the intellectual caprice that applies a surprising emotional jolt. One finds the same mixture in Cocteaus ""Orphee"" which transmitted Greek myths as if in a live broadcast and in Ravels ""Le Tombeau de Couperin"" which sought not so much to mimic Baroque musical form as to uncover a vitalizing force within the act of homage. When challenged over the seeming levity of the piece Ravel replied ""The dead are sad enough in their eternal silence"" and that will stand as a motto for ""The Artist""--a spry monochrome comedy that is tinted with regret for the rackety noise and color as far as we can hope to imagine them of lost time. Make way for the old The first thing you need to know about Alexander Paynes ""The Descendants"" is that it takes place in Hawaii. Not that we spend our time gazing at the glory of the islands; theres a lavish crane shot in which Matt King (George Clooney) points out the unspoiled patch of coastal land that his family has owned for generations but Payne prefers to focus on the foreground and on the battle of the Kings. Matt and his extended clan are preparing to sell their swath of Eden for development a deal that will bring them riches untold--so long as Matt in his capacity as chief trustee agrees to sign it. He seems distracted though and no wonder for his wife recently injured in a boating accident lies in a hospital sunk in a coma from which he is told she will never wake. Matts first task is to break the news to his daughters ten-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and her grouchy teen-aged sister Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). Hitherto he has been as he admits ""the backup parent the understudy"" and now comes his bid to assume the leading role. This is fairly fresh terrain for Clooney though it verges on the haplessness of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" Watch Matt as he breaks into a puffing sprint his gallop rendered not just unmanly but frankly girlish by the clop of his boat shoes which seem to be compulsory for all citizens. The reason for Matts haste is that via friends he has learned of Elizabeths disloyalty. Before the crash she was cheating on him with a real-estate agent named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard) and though Matt confronts her in the hospital ranting vainly at her motionless form what he really yearns to do is meet Brian face to face. And what he really fears to do is take a look at himself. In short ""The Descendants"" is the latest exhibit in Paynes careful dissection of the beached male which runs from Matthew Brodericks character in ""Election"" to Jack Nicholsons in ""About Schmidt"" and Paul Giamattis in ""Sideways."" The younger creatures in the new film--well played by Woodley and Miller with a special mention to Nick Krause who triumphs in the role of Sid Alexandras stoner pal--may look baffled but they are fighting to make something of their lives whereas you get an inescapable sense that the lives of the older guys have already been made for them. Lillards little-boy grin though ideal for selling real estate tells of panic rather than cheekiness and Brians encounter with Matt is not a clash of rutting males but a semi-polite standoff between two fleshy faltering souls striving to live up to the brazenness of their shirts. We have seen such leisurewear before on Frank Sinatra and Montgomery Clift as they toured the local bars in ""From Here to Eternity."" Both films are infused with the atmosphere of their Hawaiian setting and its strange compound of chillout and treachery. Everyone remembers Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr rolling in the surf but stay with that scene and you soon find it foaming with accusation and shame. Something similar happens to ""The Descendants"" with damp squalls and difficult mists nagging at the edge of peoples amicable warmth. Both films conclude too with floral garlands cast into the ocean though Payne provides an aftermath--a delicious downtime in which Matt and his children sit on the couch with ice cream and watch TV. Death which has loomed ahead throughout begins to drift away behind them and the film completes its journey from eternity to here.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

But George becomes a has-been when the talkies arrive until hes helped out by an ingenue Peppy Miller (Bejo).

Surrounded by so many heavy-hitters an outlier such as ""The Artist"" could get lost in the shuffle. With luck it wont. Michel Hazanaviciuss black-and-white throwback to cinemas silent era may seem steeped in fusty nostalgia but it glitters and gleams with utterly of-the-moment wit and romantic zest. French actor Jean Dujardin plays George Valentin a 1920s movie star whose career begins to teeter with the onset of sound; the fetching Berenice Bejo plays Peppy Miller a go-get-em gal and ambitious young dancer for whom the new medium seems tailor-made. One part ""A Star Is Born"" one part ""Singin in the Rain"" Hazanaviciuss homage celebrates the allure of Hollywood at its most voluptuously glamorous while poking affectionate fun at the artifice. Even with its dialogue written on old-fashioned inter-titles ""The Artist"" is anything but mute with a lush orchestral score and a little sonic wink at the the end; fewer movies this year reward listening -- and watching -- so lavishly. -- Ann Hornaday lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

A love letter to silent cinema sealed with a smirk ""The Artist"" reteams director Michel Hazanavicius with dapper ""OSS 117"" star Jean Dujardin for another high-concept homage delivering a heartfelt old-school romance without the aid of spoken dialogue or sound. Projected in black-and-white in the classic 43 aspect ratio this crowd-pleasing comedy tips its top hat to those late-20s Hollywood conventions rendered obsolete by the rise of the talkie as a pompous star fails to adapt to the new era. However inspired pic will take careful handling to shatter the arthouse ceiling as todays auds demonstrate little nostalgia for cinemas roots. In a way the medium is in similar transition today as such sincere emotional stories are forced to compete with digital spectacle and 3D extravaganzas. Fortunately its a challenge well suited to the Weinstein Co. which announced its acquisition of U.S. and some international rights to this unique French-financed American-made entry on opening day of the Cannes Film Festival. TWCs retro-style logo had already been attached to the front of the film by the time it screened four days later. ""The Artist"" opens in 1929 on a film-within-a-film starring matinee idol George Valentin (Dujardin) a square-jawed double-breasted Douglas Fairbanks type (though his masked screen persona cuts a silhouette that suggests Frances Fantomas character). Having mastered the Sean Connery shtick for the spoofier ""OSS 117"" Dujardin turns his impeccable imitation skills on a host of early film stars combining Rudolph Valentinos smoldering appeal and slicked-back hair with Errol Flynns panache and pencil moustache while preserving an essential sincerity in the process. Though the packed movie palace erupts into a boisterous ovation as soon as the house lights come up we hear nary a clap since Hazanavicius has committed to telling his story MOS (save for two unforgettably hilarious exceptions). Instead the helmer relies on infrequent English-language intertitles and a grand period-appropriate score from ""OSS"" collaborator Ludovic Bource which carries the emotion and energy of the film without resorting to anything so modern as a theme. Outside his premiere Valentin finds himself sharing the red carpet with a star-struck aspiring actress Peppy Miller (played by Hazanavicius real-life wife Brazilian stunner Berenice Bejo). Though Peppy seizes the opportunity to score a small dancing role in the studios next picture Valentins producer (John Goodman) is furious that the pompous stars antics have upstaged his film. It doesnt help that Valentin is completely distracted by Peppy on set blowing take after take as the cameras witness him falling in love. Back in Valentins dressing room Peppy proves equally smitten cozying up to his overcoat in a bit that perfectly fits how one of her characters might behave onscreen. More respectful of his marriage to forever-dissatisfied Doris (Penelope Ann Miller) than most actors of the era were toward their spouses Valentin resists making a pass at Peppy when the time seems right. Such courtesy has consequences however forcing their romance into a state of unrequited suspension as their careers veer in opposite directions Peppy embraces the talking-pictures era a nice sequence recapping her rise through the credits of several films while Valentin scoffs ""Im the one people come to see. They never needed to hear me."" Truth be told theres good reason Valentin resists this new fad in filmmaking though we dont learn his secret until the very last scene. Along the way Hazanavicius has inventive fun with the characters silence particularly in one dream sequence where Valentin hears foley effects for the first time yet still finds it impossible to speak. At home divorce-ready Doris gives new meaning to the words ""We need to talk George."" Valentins only companions during his harsh fall from the spotlight are his chauffeur Clifton (James Cromwell) and faithful Jack Russell terrier -- one of those star dogs well trained enough to rescue his master from scrapes both onscreen and off. But Peppy holds a place for Valentin in her heart evident not only with each successive encounter but also in her discreet actions to support the self-destructive star without his knowing. Although Valentin represents a corny breed of heartthrob for which todays auds have no use Hazanavicius looks to the more artistically ambitious films of the era (and several subsequent decades) to inspire his own directorial style. Cribbing from Fritz Langs ""Spies"" he stages a conversation between Valentin and Peppy on the stairs of Los Angeles Bradbury Building while undercranked extras speed by around them. Later Valentins climactic meltdown lifts an overhead shot straight from ""Citizen Kane."" Such references are offered less for the benefit of film geeks than for the mere fact that they offer the most elegant solutions for framing the scenes in question. Rather than using the harsh stagebound look of the period d.p. Guillaume Schiffman embraces the softer more glamorous lensing of 40s-era Hollywood productions shooting on color stock and then converting it to black-and-white in post. The look flatters the cast especially Dujardin whose incandescent charm comes through just fine with his arsenal of arched eyebrows wry smiles and the other nonverbal tricks.

"The Artist (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Artist (PG-13) This elegant throwback to the silent movies of the 1920s is a feat of creative filmmaking. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/19/2011 Editor rating 3 The Artist is a brazen stunt that pays off. Writer-director Michel Hazanavicius simultaneously channeling Singin in the Rain and A Star is Born tells a story about 1920s Hollywood made in the style of 1920s Hollywood a silent black-and-white picture shot in the old-school 133 format (a square not rectangular image). The result is a disarming valentine to Hollywood that doesnt feel the slightest bit self-congratulatory - an utterly enchanting bauble. Hazanavicius kicks the story off on a self-reflexive note In 1927 the sold-out audience inside a beautiful movie palace watches the latest hit starring the beloved actor George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) with live musical accompaniment from an orchestra at the theater. When the film-within-a-film ends Valentine steps onto the stage to bask in the applause of the audience. The music stops and The Artist goes totally silent giving the movie the first of its many ""Whoa"" moments. Valentin is a huge star a fine actor and all-around nice guy. The only person who doesnt seem to care much for him is his pampered wife (Penelope Ann Miller) whom he has learned to tolerate. The simple plot of The Artist follows what happens when the film industry becomes enamored of a new kind of picture -- the talkies -- and Valentin is relegated to the trash heap of yesterdays news. And as his marquee value plummets the star of a newcomer (Berenice Bejo) rises. The Artist doesnt really look like something dug up from the 1920s The image is too pristine (the movie was originally shot in color because of the scarcity of black-and-white film stock) the editing rhythms and camera angles noticeably modern. Only the acting -- amusing mugging by Dujardin Bejo and a supporting cast that includes John Goodman as a studio mogul -- genuinely captures the spirit of films from the era. But Hazanavicius is aiming for something much trickier than mimickry He wants to make a contemporary audience to invest emotionally in his story despite all the distractions and limitations inherent in a silent movie. And although The Artist would have benefitted from some trims -- an hour and 40 minutes is an awfully long running time for this slight material -- we do end up caring deeply for Valentin as his world collapses and practically everyone abandons him (even his shadow turns away from him). Hazanavicius cant resist indulging in the occasional sound gag startling and funny in the midst of all the silence (think Mel Brooks Silent Movie although infinitely more sophisticated). He also gets fantastic work from Valentins Jack Russell terrier -- one of the best canine screen performances I have ever seen. And even if the movie spends a little too much time on Valentins downfall the exuberant finale makes up for the excess -- a pitch-perfect ending that answers all your questions in one deft stroke (why wouldnt the studio hire Valentin to act in talkies anyway?) and sends you home with your head in the clouds intoxicated by the magic movies pull off better than any other art form. The Artist seems destined to win a multitude of Oscars in March and although the picture is rather thin and mostly trivial you cant quite begrudge the film all the love it is receiving.  Its sweet earnest and irresistible even if all it has to say is ""Movies are awesome.""

He makes that explicit upfront in Into The Abyss his latest documentary and he questions the necessity of it whenever the occasion arises. However his film isnt about the death penalty so much as it is a moving disquisition on violent death itself and how it transforms anyone connected to it--victims perpetrators and those who work in the Death House. The two young men convicted in a 10-year-old triple murder in small-town Texas--one serving a life sentence the other a week away from execution--have conflicting stories about who did what and both protest their innocence. Though Herzog gives them room to make their case Into The Abyss isnt a Paradise Lost-style documentary about wrongful conviction. Instead it collects testimony from a range of different people including the victims families the locals and most poignantly a chaplain who accompanies inmates on the gurney and a Death House team leader whose pro-death penalty convictions withered away after escorting dozens of men (and the first woman) to their deaths. Herzogs queries are typically odd at times but his frankness and gentle curiosity gets his subjects talking and he seems to get the most out of every one of them. (If he werent so busy making films Herzog would be the ideal host of a Marc Maron-like podcast.)Grade B+ Among UsDirector/Country/Time Marco van Geffen/The Netherlands/84 min.Cast Dagmara Bak Natalia Rybicka Rifka LodeizenProgram DiscoveryHeadline The hand that rocks the cradle is most likely from another countryNoels Take In Marco van Geffens puzzle-drama Among Us a Dutch couple hires a young Polish woman played by Dagmara Bak to be the nanny to their toddler but quickly get creeped-out and later exasperated by how quiet she is and how uninterested she seems to be in socializing or leaving the house. When the couple reaches their limit they sack Bak and then Among Us doubles back to retell the story from the perspective of another Polish nanny who fills in some of the details of Baks strange behavior. Then it doubles back one more time to tell the story from Baks perspective and thus complete the picture... sort of. Among Us is precisely paced and framed--always making sure to record the relationships between the adult characters the children and the various status objects they arrange around themselves--in ways that recall Michael Haneke at his most mysterious. But my major hesitation with the film is that Im honestly not sure I ""got it."" I thought I knew what Baks big secret was going to be but van Geffen never expressly states it and the last shot of Among Us reveals something wholly unexpected casting whats gone before in a new light. Id have to see the movie again to figure out how it all fits together. But to van Geffens credit a re-watch wouldnt be a chore since Among Us depiction of everyday cultural misunderstandings and assumptions is well-sketched and gripping even when its oblique.Grade B Source The ArtistDirector/Country/Time Michel Hazanavicius/France/100 min.Cast Jean Dujardin Berenice Bejo John GoodmanProgram Special PresentationsHeadline Hooray for HollywoodNoels Take Though its set in the late 20s and intended as a black-and-white silent movie homage Michel Hazanavicius The Artist doesnt much resemble the movies its paying tribute to. Its closer to Singin In The Rain and A Star Is Born--two tales of unlikely romance in Old Hollywood--than it is to Chaplin or Griffith. Jean Dujardin  plays a dashing movie star who falls in love with ambitious extra Berenice Bejo and helps her launch her own career. Then talking pictures arrive and the Bejos star rises while Dujardins falls. The Artists arc is way too predictable and on the whole its nowhere near as emotionally impactful as the movies it nods to. (It doesnt help that Hazanavicius drags out the ""on the skids"" section far longer than he needs to.) But throughout Hazanavicius finds clever poetic ways to illustrate the allure of Golden Age Hollywood stardom whether its Bejo dancing with Dujardins empty tuxedo or the couple falling in love while doing multiple takes of a scene. And the ending is boffo. Without giving too much away when the question ""One more?"" gets answered ""With pleasure"" its not just the characters talking but Hazanavicius himself standing up for this magical era of cinema. One more? Why not?Grade B+ Source Chicken With PlumsDirector/Country/Time Marjane Satrapi amp; Vincent Paronnaud/France/91 min.Cast Mathieu Amalric Edouard Baer Maria De MedeirosProgram Special PresentationsHeadline A recipe for heartbreakNoels Take Unlike Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Parranouds animated adaptation of Satrapis graphic autobiography Persepolis their big-screen take on Satrapis comic Chicken With Plums was shot with actors on sets. And yet in some ways its even cartoonier than Persepolis. Mathieu Almaric stars as a melancholy violinist who decides that life has lost all potential for pleasure and so he decides to take to his bed and wait for death. Chicken With Plums goes day-by-day with the deathwatch and on each day explores a piece of the heros history or examines the past and future of a member of his family or digresses into outright folklore. Just as the story combines the fantastical with the biographical (based on Satrapi family legends) so does the filmmaking veer from straightforward drama to something more outsized. The tonal shifts dont always work--theres a fake sitcom sequence that bombs badly for example--but the nested narrative structure gives the movie a sense of inevitability that makes it all the more powerful when Almarics wife and kids try to figure out what could make him happy. What they dont realize is that his depression only has a little to do with them and a lot to do with living for decades under the heavy boot of fate.Grade B+ Source Goodbye First LoveDirector/Country/Time Mia Hansen-Love/France/110 min.Cast Lola Creton Sebastian Urzendowsky Magne BrekkeProgram Contemporary World CinemaHeadline Young hearts beat free then they go on to do other stuffNoels Take At one point in Mia Hansen-Loves Goodbye First Love an architecture professor lectures his students about ""glimmer"" which he defines as that quality of light that can turn an ordinary structure into something special. Goodbye First Love has that glimmer in spades. In telling the story of a teenage romance that ends in heartbreak--and then following the decade-long aftermath--Goodbye First Love is covering dramatic ground so well-trod that it may as well be paved. But the details of the piece are wholly Hansen-Love. Beginning with the last weeks of a passionate romance--which ends when the dreamy Sebastian Urzendowsky leaves the moody Lola Creton to go on a 10-month trip and then gradually slacks off on letters and phone calls-- Hansen-Love evokes the burning intensity of young love and how it can be so painful for the participants that being together is more miserable than breaking up. We then see Creton struggle to get her head straight in the ensuing years until she finally settles in with an older man (that professor from above played by Magne Brekke) and launches a promising architecture career of her own. Inevitably Urzendowsky returns and the exes fall back into old patterns only now its Urzendowsky who seems like the clingy immature one. Goodbye First Love sometimes tells when it should show; and theres a heavy measure of predictability to its plot. But thats only because the situation is so common in real life the devotion that borders on suffocation the hurt that feels like itll never go away and the maturation that leads to a different set of priorities. Hansen-Love both romanticizes the fervor of adolescent relationships--particularly the way that young lovers feel prematurely like grown-ups--and illustrates why theyre untenable. The result is a movie thats poignant bittersweet and true.Grade A- Source The House Of ToleranceDirector/Country/Time Bertrand Bonello/France/125 min.Cast Noemie Lvovsky Hafsia Herzi Jasmine TrincaProgram VisionsHeadline Bordello Of BloodScotts Take So it turns out the worlds oldest profession is a pretty shitty job whether youre a 21st century streetwalker in Paris or housed in an elegantly appointed brothel at the turns of the 20th. The House Of Tolerance makes that connection clear enough by inserting anachronistic music on the soundtrack--the use of a certain late-60s parent-rock favorite by the Moody Blues is particularly inspired--and later makes it perhaps clearer than necessary. Stretching out over an appealingly hazy 125 minutes Bertrand Bonellos film follows the slow decline of a country brothel and the uncertainty shared by women who already have no rights and no sense of financial security. Despite the expensive dresses the champagne baths and the illusion of upper-crust politesse the realities of the job are often the same then as now Hookers carry debts that only deepen over time; moneyed clients are no less prone to shocking violence and abuse; and those who are victimized by disease or other physical ailments or scars are essentially doomed. Though few of the characters stand out the brothel itself takes on the qualities of an organism--one thats mostly bonded in feminine solidarity but nonetheless subject to forces beyond its control. Without soft-pedaling it--the story of ""The Girl Who Laughs"" alone will brush away that line of criticism--Bonello nonetheless mourns the extinction of the brothel where the women at least had each other.Grade A- Source Miss BalaDirector/Country/Time Gerardo Naranjo/Mexico/108 min.Cast Stephanie Sigman Noe Hernandez James RussoProgram Contemporary World CinemaHeadline The Tiara Of TerrorScotts Take A nice festival companion to Drive Gerardo Naranjos Miss Bala is also a formally dazzling thriller about a lead character forced--here by fate rather than choice--into a dangerous situation with precious little room to maneuver. Here Stephanie Sigman stars as a Tijuana teenager who dreams of becoming the next Miss Baja California. Be careful what you wish for. At the wrong place at the wrong time she witnesses a nightclub ambush by a drug gang; when she tries to go to the police to inquire about a missing friend a corrupt cop delivers her right to the gangs vicious leader played by Noe Hernandez. In a plot rife with dark ironies Naranjo posits Sigman as the stand-in for ordinary Mexican citizens left powerless by drug cartels on one side and a compromised police force on the other. Though her options are far more limited than Ryan Goslings in Drive shes not an entirely passive victim either trying desperately to wriggle free from the role the gang has cast her to play. Naranjo renders her harrowing ordeal in spectacular style with lots of long dynamic takes shot from unconventional vantage points and a relentless pace that shuttles his heroine from one tense situation to another without pausing for breath. Though it toes a delicate line between exploitation movie and movie about exploitation thats part of what gives the film its charge.Grade A- Source Outside SatanDirector/Country/Time Bruno Dumont/France/109 min.Cast David Dewaele Alexandra LematreProgram MastersHeadline In The Craggy Hills Of Coastal France An Auteurist TrapScotts Take When miracles are commonplace they cease to be miracles. That in a nutshell is the problem with Bruno Dumont an auteur whose transcendentalism has become just one in a predictable rotation of recurring elements. The others? A rural savant with divine gifts a murder ""mystery"" animalistic sex scenes lots of grunting and screaming shocking bursts of violence and third-act moments of grace. Though I wasnt entirely sold on Dumonts last film 2009s Hadewijch its story of the diverted faith seemed to signal a newfound willingness to break form. Outside Satan takes Dumont a full step backward as he retreats to yet another tedious variation on themes that would seem too specific to repeat. David Dewaele plays a drifter who skulks around a coastal village and shares an unusual relationship with a teenage girl for whom he kills a couple of a couple of people including her father. The stranger and more inexplicable Outside Satan gets the better--the drifters encounter with a female hiker is well something to discuss--but mostly the film treads on a familiar landscape mixing-and-matching motifs from LHumanite Flanders Twentynine Palms and The Life Of Jesus without standing on its own. His impeccable style has never been in question; its his purpose that seems in doubt.Grade C- Source Oslo August 31stDirector/Country/Time Joachim Trier/Norway/96 min.Cast Anders Danielsen Lie Hans Olar Brenner Ingrid OlavaProgram VanguardHeadline When I Put A Spike Into My VeinScotts Take Scaling back the flash of his promising debut feature Reprise Joachim Triers Oslo August 31st deals honestly and unsentimentally with a recovering addict trying to puzzle out life after rehab. Beautifully scripted--and no less literate than Reprise which took place in the world of publishing--the film begins with Anders Danielsen Lie a 34-year-old of means and talent attempting to commit suicide. Still in a fragile state despite being 10 months sober Lie is allowed to leave rehab for a late-summer day in Oslo where hes squeezed a job interview at a magazine between visiting his old friend (Hans Olar Brenner) and his sister. Despite his admitted temptation to score heroin at the first opportunity Lies biggest problem isnt staying sober but finding some kind of life thats going to be meaningful for him. The scenes between Lie and Brenner crystallize his deep existential dread which his friend cant dispel with half-hearted endorsements of family life and bourgeois normalcy. As day turns to night the film shifts into a more perilous odyssey fueled by Lies doubts about the purpose of recovery. Trier writes his hero into a very tight corner but finds a simultaneously graceful and uncompromising way out of it. Neat trick that.Grade B+ Source The Skin I Live InDirector/Country/Time Pedro Almodovar/Spain/117 min.Cast Antonio Banderas Elena Anaya Marisa ParedesProgram Special PresentationsHeadline Dig the new fleshNoels Take The Skin I Live In marks Pedro Almodovars take on the body-horror and kinky thriller genres--like David Cronenberg crossed with Brian De Palma--but Almodovars a little too clinical in his visual approach to deliver real shocks. Antonio Banderas stars as a plastic surgeon who experiments on new kinds of skin and face transplants using an abductee as his test subject. In an extended mid-film flashback we learn the story of the abductee a supple-looking young woman played by Elena Anaya. The biggest problem with The Skin I Live In is that the flashback does in an hour what couldve easily have been done in 15 minutes especially given that most of the revelations are telegraphed long before they arrive. Another problem is that Almodovar reverts too easily to his stock melodrama mode with glossy surfaces covering up the characters deep hurt and loss. Had he embraced the genre more and changed his style to suit a story in which human beings get hacked-up and transformed he mightve naturally found his way into a more potent and satisfying narrative rather than one that dawdles and dead-ends. Nevertheless theres something fitting about a movie concerned with the cosmetic being so pristine. Thematically it works even when it falls short dramatically.Grade B Source Tomorrow A big day with new films by Alexander Payne and Guy Maddin and a fresh take on Wuthering Heights.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern November 25 2011 Martin Scorseses love of the movie medium shines through almost every frame of ""Hugo"" which culminates in a creation--a fascinating re-creation--that could only have been achieved by a filmmaker with all of the mediums resources at his command. This live-action entertainment shot in strikingly effective 3-D and expanded by computer imagery is set mainly in a 1930s Paris train station where a young orphan named Hugo Cabret lives a secret life tending the machinery that keeps the stations clocks running. No other film has summoned up such a vast complexity of wheels cranks levers ratchets and cogs all of it coupled to a tale of loss yearning mysteries revealed and happiness regained. Yet the acting is mechanistic too the comic timing is off by a country kilometer and the action drags dismayingly between a succession of kinetic set pieces and pell-mell chases. Watch a clip from the new 3-D film ""Hugo"" directed by Martin Scorsese. The source material is a graphic novel by Brian Selznick called ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret."" (John Logan did the screen adaptation.) Its easy to see in the books sumptuous black-and-white illustrations and spare text what Mr. Scorsese must have seen as an irresistible opportunity--not only to make a movie for kids and adults alike but to share his passion for movie history. Thats because Hugos story leads in serpentine fashion to the cinema pioneer Georges Melies who is played with a somber demeanor by Ben Kingsley. And the story of Melies who built the worlds first movie studio near Paris in 1896 has allowed Mr. Scorsese to reproduce that studio with scrupulous attention to historical detail as well as to re-create the making of the worlds first sci-fi film the 1902 ""A Trip to the Moon."" (The connection between Melies and the train station seems too far-fetched to be true but it too derives from historical fact.) Some of these sequences are beautiful and revelatory in the bargain for youngsters who may have no notion of how moving pictures began. Kids will also be intrigued by the crucial plot element of a clockwork automaton which meshes in turn with Hugos haunting memories of having had a loving father and a happy home. The film is filled with felicitous visual inventions the daily life of the train station with its massive locomotives and clouds of steam that evoke Claude Monets painting ""La Gare Saint-Lazare""; a storybook Paris (though the aerial views sometime look like ""Ratatouille""); moving images in an old-fashioned flip book; elaborate drawings generated by the automaton plus an abundance of movie references and homages to filmmakers. Audiences are sure to turn out for ""Hugo"" in huge numbers since its spectacle functions in the service of a reunion fantasy that restores the young hero and the aged Melies to their proper places in the world. Yet thematic potency and cinematic virtuosity--the production was designed by Dante Ferretti and photographed by Robert Richardson--cant conceal a deadly inertness at the films core. The young actor in the title role Asa Butterfield is a bland presence with a painfully narrow range of facial expressions. Humphrey Bogart used to joke about his narrow range but when the camera cuts to Hugo hes either looking determined or more often than not simply blank. Chloe Grace Moretz has clearly been directed to breathe excitement into the role of Isabelle Hugos friend and Georgess goddaughter but her earnest efforts like her accent are consistently out of scale. Worst of all Hugos nemesis a supposedly comical cop played by Sacha Baron Cohen is hardly more expressive than Hugo and thuddingly unfunny. The character is a Gallic cliche bereft of fresh ideas while the actor is hobbled by editing rhythms--and very likely by directorial choices--that put a premium on long glowers pregnant pauses and chases that for all their ostensible energy grow grindingly repetitive. Visually ""Hugo"" is a marvel but dramatically its a clockwork lemon. The Artist Watch a trailer for ""The Artist"" a new movie shot in the style of a classic silent film. Courtesy the Weinstein Company. Movie love also suffuses Michel Hazanaviciuss ""The Artist"" a French production that is lovable from start to finish. Mostly silent and entirely black-and-white this superbly stylish comedy is set in Hollywood and starts in 1927 when audiences were still enraptured by the soundless sight of Hollywood stars on the silver screen. The movies fictional star George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a charming peacock-vain amalgam of Douglas Fairbanks and John Gilbert with a constant canine companion who does clever pooch tricks. (In a nightmare about the sound era to come George discovers that he cant speak though his dog can bark.) Berenice Bejo is enchanting as an extra Peppy Miller who comes to Georges attention by sheer accident or maybe ambition but in either case sheer. Once she does he takes pleasure in her talent as well as her beauty; he even punctuates her radiant puss with a Gloria Swanson beauty mark. If you thought ""Singin in the Rain"" was the last word on Hollywoods transition to talkies ""The Artist"" adds silence a buoyant spirit and graceful music. George and Peppy care for each other even yearn for each other. In one inventive interlude she sneaks into his dressing room puts an arm through the sleeve of a jacket on a hanger and caresses herself with a hand she imagines to be his. But their trajectories are those of ""A Star Is Born""--hers upward his downward--and they lead to complications that Mr. Hazanavicius treats with a light and cosmopolitan touch. (In one wry touch the stars chair on a set has his name on it but the screenwriters chair says only Screenwriter.) ENLARGE Berenice Bejo in The Artist. The Weinstein Company ""The Artist"" was shot in 35 days--the cinematographer was Guillaume Schiffman--but youd never know it. The dance numbers are elegant though modestly staged. George and Peppy are amusing when they first dance together but they finally come on like Fred and Ginger within the glittering confines of an Art Deco set. Los Angeles locations enhance Laurence Bennetts production design. (One distinctive scene with crowds on a staircase was filmed in the citys landmark Bradbury Building.) The cast includes John Goodman as a cigar-chomping producer and James Cromwell as Georges loyal chauffeur; hes the counterpart to the Erich von Stroheim character in ""Sunset Boulevard."" The movie felt a bit long when I saw it at the Telluride Film Festival a few months ago and equally so when I saw it again last week. The problem isnt so much the length--the running time is only 100 minutes--but the pacing which tends to be on the slow and slightly self-enchanted side when passions arent raging or pounding chases arent under way. Thats far from a serious drawback though. Silence makes the film interesting by enticing us to concentrate in ways were not used to while artistry carries the day. ""The Artist"" may have started as a daring stunt but it elevates itself to an endearing--and probably enduring--delight. A Dangerous Method David Cronenberg a past master of scary films (including ""The Fly"" ""Dead Ringers"" and ""Scanners"") opens this one with a flourish of gothic horror a beautiful young woman restrained by two men screams frantically inside a coach drawn by a pair of black horses. But the subject isnt mayhem; the movie is about the personal and intellectual rivalry between Jung and Freud in the early years of the 20th century and the woman who upset both mens apple carts. ""A Dangerous Method"" which was adapted by Christopher Hampton from several sources including his own play represents a big growth spurt in Mr. Cronenbergs career. Its measured pace along with a style that is sometimes austere (though sometimes anything but) repays close attention with excellent acting and a wealth of absorbing information. ENLARGE Michael Fassbender and Keira Knightley in A Dangerous Method. Sony Pictures Classics Michael Fassbender is the Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. Relatively new to the profession Jung is looking for a suitable patient to treat with the experimental talking cure or psychoanalysis developed by mentor and father figure Sigmund Freud (hes played by Viggo Mortensen). The two performances are quietly complementary yet emphatically distinct. Mr. Fassbenders venturesome Jung conceals for a while a searching mind and a passionate heart behind a professionally correct facade while Mr. Mortensens rigid Freud conveys calm authority that springs from profound self-regard. Keira Knightley is Sabina Spielrein the young woman in the coach who arrives from Russia to be Jungs patient--shes frequently seized by violent episodes of hysteria--and then his lover in an unethical and tortured romance. Ms. Knightleys performance is problematic partly thanks to an intrusive Russian accent and to the inherent extravagance of Sabinas behavior but its still a skillful portrait of the gifted woman who became a psychiatrist in her own right and who in the evolution of psychoanalysis exerted significant intellectual influence on Freud. Vincent Cassell is the psychiatrist--and patient--Otto Gross a druggy hedonist who urges Jung to cross the ethical line. Peter Suschitzky did the cinematography which masterfully understates the movies case in blacks rich browns and vibrant yellows. My Week With Marilyn When bad movies happen to good people the first place to look for an explanation is the basic idea. That certainly applies to ""My Week With Marilyn"" a dubious idea done in by Adrian Hodgess shallow script and Simon Curtiss clumsy direction. Watch a scene from ""My Week With Marilyn"" starring Michelle Williams and silver screen icon Marilyn Monroe. Courtesy the Weinstein Company. The week in question was in 1956. Thats when Colin Clark a young Oxford graduate from a distinguished family worked as a lowly gofer on the set of ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" an Edwardian comedy that starred Marilyn Monroe opposite Laurence Oliver who was also the films producer and director. The pairing was as exasperating as it was unlikely. Olivier a no-nonsense professional who happened to be a genius of stage and screen couldnt abide Monroes neediness her spasms of neurotic paralysis or the protective people around her who conflicted with his directorial authority. The new movie which was adapted from Clarks published recollections is told from his perspective; hes played appealingly by Eddie Redmayne. Michelle Williams is Marilyn and Kenneth Branagh is Olivier. The best part of ""My Week With Marilyn"" is a coming-of-age-story Colin became Marilyns friend and companion and grew to understand the fear that prompted her erratic behavior. (He went on to become a noted writer and filmmaker.) But the main part is the battle of the stars and it clanks false on both sides. Mr. Branaghs Olivier is a busy parody stripped of his subjects rapier wit on stage and his simplicity offstage. Ms. Williamss dear-in-the-headlights Marilyn displays one quality at a time--usually kewpie-doll vulnerability--without a hint of the shrewdness and technical knowledge that Monroe brought to her sets. The only suggestion of spontaneity occurs when Ms. Williams does a delightful little dance taken directly from Monroes screen performance. The only convincing character is Sybil Thorndike who seems to have been taken directly from Judi Denchs unerring instincts. DVD Focus Georges Melies First Wizard Of the Cinema (2008) ENLARGE Looking for a Christmas present that will dazzle a cinephile friend (or bring you up to speed on the seminal figure that inspired Martin Scorsese to do what he did in ""Hugo"")? This five-DVD Flicker Alley set isnt cheap--it goes for 67.50 at Flickeralley.com--but its an impeccable rendering of a remarkable compilation. ""A Trip to the Moon"" is included of course along with 170 or so other films that Melies made in his Paris studio beginning with ""Card Party"" in 1896 and ending with ""The Voyage of the Bourrichon Family"" in 1913. The Prince of Tides (1991) Barbra Streisand as a psychologist? When I could have picked John Hustons ""Freud"" with Montgomery Clift in the title role or ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with Anthony Hopkins as both shrink and patient? I picked it because you might not have thought of it and because its a good movie in its own right. Ms. Streisand directed from an adaptation of the Pat Conroy novel by Mr. Conroy and Becky Johnston. The excellent cast includes Nick Nolte Blythe Danner Kate Nelligan Jeroen Krabbe Melinda Dillon George Carlin and the directors son Jason Gould. Some Like It Hot (1959) This was the film Marilyn Monroe made immediately after ""The Prince and the Showgirl"" and the artistic apex of her career. Billy Wilders peerless comedy stars--in case youve been away for the past half-century--Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as Jerry and Joe a couple of struggling musicians who evade the Mob by passing themselves off as women and joining an all-girl band. Monroe is the bands singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk. She gets to ask the silliest question ever asked while snuggling next to Jerry in a sleeping-car berth ""Im not crowding you am I?""

Its a predominantly silent film in black and white with lead actors you likely havent seen before. And yet its delightful simply lovely a tribute to the magic that occasionally takes place when inspiration meets resources. The year is 1927 and silent films are still all the rage. Actor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is at the top of his game hes got a grilled cheese eating grin a chauffeur and a cute little dog that appears in all his movies with him. Those films are big and broad appealing to the masses. For example he stars in A German Affair to follow up on his hit film A Russian Affair. The toast of the town thats George. One day George is taking photos with his adoring fans when a girl catches is eye. The photographers go crazy for the pairing her name is Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) and they make the front cover of Variety with the headline ""Whos That Girl?"" As you can imagine Georges wife is none too pleased. But its just another charmed day in the life of the silent film star and he dutifully reports to work the next day ... only to find Peppy has been cast as an extra She captures the attention of a producer (John Goodman) who immediately berates her for stealing the thunder of the film hes releasing as George and Peppys impromptu photo session stole the front page from him. George intercedes on her behalf and they film a scene together. They are clearly smitten the chemistry palpable and as he leaves the set she attempts to arrange a liaison with him in his dressing room. Hes her hero you see and she wants to be near him in the manner of all initial and overwhelming attraction. George happens upon her gives her some friendly advice on her career and then the chauffeur interrupts. Alas hes married and shes on her way up in the game so their interaction is short lived. Unfortunately for George trouble is a brewing and its coming in the form of talking. George is a silent film expert and he rejects the idea of talking in his movies leaving him dangerously out of touch. Conversely Peppys career is starting to gain real steam partly thanks to George and his advice. The Artist unfolds in the typical silent film fashion as George and Peppy head in disparate career trajectories and by 1931 George has become a husk of his former self. The film has a few central themes running through it how change comes to us all how our pride interferes with matters of the heart how stubbornness masquerading as strength can sap ones vitality. But most of all its the story of George and Peppy. Can they make it work? Are they star crossed? Could Georges little Jack Russell Terrier be any cuter? And so on. The Artist conjures a time of happiness without subtext or irony when what you saw was essentially what you got at the movies. Mugging for the camera was the only way to truly get over with a story but things were bound to change and commerce waits for no man. Recent movies such as Wall-E have executed a nearly flawless ""silent"" film experience but nothing is quite the throwback that The Artist is. By rousing a forgotten medium director Michel Hazanavicius has given us a little gift of cinema. Form did follow function at the movies and it is an understatement to say that sound has helped the industry but The Artist with its charm verve and timing is a real treat. Highly recommended for any serious fan of cinema The Artist says it best when it says nothing at all.
